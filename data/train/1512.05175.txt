    "giant exoplanets orbiting very close to their parent star ( hot jupiters ) are thought to become tidally locked on timescales of 0.1 - 100 myr @xcite , much shorter than the typical age of the observed systems .",
    "this configuration leads to extreme temperature contrasts between the permanently irradiated hemisphere and the night - side .",
    "the presence of an atmosphere can partially mitigate the temperature contrast , by recirculating the incident stellar energy from the day- to the night - side through winds .",
    "modeling and observing the mechanisms driving the heat redistribution in exoplanet atmospheres is important to understand their global energy balance .    one common outcome of both numerical ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and analytical @xcite simulations is that relatively deep in the planet atmosphere ( at pressures of @xmath71 bar ) giant planets develop equatorial jet winds streaming eastward ( e.g. , following the planet rotation ) .",
    "since those pressures are representative of the planet photosphere and therefore of the broad - band planet thermal emission , this deep circulation shifts the hottest point in the planet atmosphere away from the sub - stellar point .",
    "higher - up in the atmosphere ( at pressures @xmath8 mbar ) , winds predominantly flow from the day to the night side , crossing the planet terminator at all latitudes . enriching this basic picture ,",
    "high - altitude winds can be damped by magnetic drag due to the interaction of the partially - ionized atmosphere with a possible planetary magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as a consequence , wind speeds and the relative importance of equatorial jets and global day- to night - side circulation are expected to vary broadly from planet to planet . finally , the atmosphere and the planet interior do not always reach perfect tidal synchronization @xcite , meaning that global atmospheric super - rotation or sub - rotation are also possible .",
    "observational constraints on the energy recirculation of hot - jupiter atmospheres have been placed by broadband observations of secondary eclipses and thermal phase curves ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "some work indeed confirms the presence of eastward displacements in the maximum of the thermal emission @xcite , which is in line with the above theoretical predictions .",
    "other work either lacks the continuous phase coverage for assessing such a trend @xcite , or show no evidence for a displacement @xcite .",
    "optical phase curves have been obtained mostly thanks to the _ kepler _ mission , which resulted in additional constraints on exoplanet albedo and winds @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", high - resolution spectroscopy has enabled robust constraints on fundamental parameters of exoplanet atmospheres . due to their unique fingerprint at high dispersion",
    ", molecular species can be robustly identified via line matching , in contrast to the potential ambiguities in the interpretation of planet spectra observed at low - resolution or with sparse photometric bands .",
    "in addition , high - dispersion spectroscopy is sensitive to the planet orbital motion .",
    "this offers an effective way to disentangle the doppler - shifted planet spectrum from the contamination of our own atmosphere , which is instead essentially static in wavelength . for non - transiting planets",
    "the detection of the planet motion translates into a measurement of the actual planet mass ( rather than an upper limit ) and orbital inclination .",
    "high - dispersion observations with crires at the vlt led to the first measurement of the radial velocity of an exoplanet through the detection of co in the transmission spectrum of hd  209458  b @xcite , and to the first detection of the atmosphere of a non - transiting planet ( @xmath9 botis  b , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these studies were conducted around 2.3  and targeted a ro - vibrational band of carbon monoxide , which is expected to be abundant in hot planet atmospheres and has a well - known and regularly - spaced sequence of lines .",
    "these factors make it one of the most favorable species for detection .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite demonstrated the feasibility of high - resolution observations in the @xmath10-band and detected h@xmath11o  in the atmospheres of a transiting ( ) and a non - transiting ( @xmath9 botis  b ) planet .",
    "water vapor has a much more complex high - resolution signature than carbon monoxide and the telluric absorption at 3.2 - 3.5  is more severe , making it a good test for the robustness of these observational methods .",
    "it is also worth noting that the detection of @xcite was obtained by utilizing nirspec at keck , at only 1/4 of the resolving power of crires ( 25,000 instead of 100,000 ) , but with a wider wavelength range .",
    "this demonstrates that spectral resolution can be partially traded for spectral coverage for this type of observation .",
    "finally , high - resolution spectroscopy was recently utilized to provide a first estimate of the c / o ratio in the atmosphere of hd  179949  b @xcite .",
    "the latter parameter is potentially related to the formation history of planets @xcite and to the presence of thermal inversion layers in their atmospheres @xcite . in this work",
    "we focus on the additional capabilities of high - dispersion observations to directly detect the doppler signature of rotation and atmospheric circulation from a transiting exoplanet .",
    "already @xcite reported a marginal detection of winds flowing from the day- to the night - side of hd  209458  b , deduced from the measured ( @xmath12 )  kms@xmath3  blue - shift in the total cross - correlation signal .",
    "this result was further discussed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "they linked the theoretical expectations based on atmospheric circulation models to the observable doppler signature at high spectral resolution .",
    "it is worth noting that the alternative interpretation of the @xmath13  kms@xmath3  shift as due to orbital eccentricity @xcite is excluded by the latest refinement of the planet orbital parameters @xcite . at optical wavelengths",
    ", @xcite also claimed high - altitude winds in the atmosphere of hd  189733  b by measuring a blue - shift in the planet sodium absorption of @xmath14  kms@xmath3 .",
    "more recently , @xcite inferred the fast rotational rate of the young , directly - imaged , giant planet @xmath15  pic  b by measuring the broadening of the planet spectral features . in this case the rotational period of only @xmath16  hours produced a broadening of 25  kms@xmath3 , well resolved at the spectral resolution of crires ( fwhm  @xmath17  kms@xmath3 ) .    here",
    "we search for the doppler signature of synchronous rotation and atmospheric circulation in the high - resolution transmission spectrum of @xcite .",
    "this is one of the best - studied exoplanets to date , thanks to the apparent brightness of the host star ( k = 5.54 mag ) .",
    "this richness of information translates into observational evidence for rather unique features , such as atmospheric escape @xcite and the prominence of haze @xcite masking most of the spectral features in the optical transmission spectrum , except for atomic sodium @xcite and potassium @xcite .",
    "this planet also has some constraint on energy recirculation and day / night side contrasts from multi - wavelength infrared phase curves @xcite .",
    "one of the most distinctive features of the phase curve is a displacement of the planet hot - spot towards the east , and a low day to night side temperature contrast at shorter infrared wavelengths , indicating an efficient heat recirculation between the two hemispheres .",

    "we describe the telescope , instrument , and observations . in section  [ analysis ]",
    "we present our data analysis , with a particular focus on the subtraction of the stellar spectrum to avoid contamination from the stellar co lines ( section  [ rm_star ] ) . in section  [ extraction ]",

    "the detected signal is presented in section  [ results ] and the implications for the atmosphere of  are discussed in section  [ discussion ] , together with some general advice for future high - dispersion observations of exoplanets .",
    "we observed one transit of with the cryogenic infra - red echelle spectrograph ( crires , * ? ? ? * ) at the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) facility .",
    "the spectrograph is mounted at the nasmyth - a focus of the antu unit .",
    "we opted for the highest available spectral resolution ( @xmath20  =  100,000 ) by observing through the 0@xmath21.2 slit , and we selected the standard wavelength setting with @xmath22  nm , approximately covering the range 2287.5 - 2345.4  nm .",
    "the spectra are imaged on four detectors having @xmath23 pixels in the spectral and spatial direction respectively .",
    "gaps of 282 , 278 , and 275 pixels in the spectral direction are due to the physical separation of each detector .",
    "the throughput of crires was maximized by observing in conjunction with the multi application curvature adaptive optic system ( macao , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for accurate background subtraction , we nodded by 10  along the slit with no jitter , according to an abba sequence .",
    "the transit of hd  189733  b was observed with the ddt proposal 289.c-5030 on 2012 , july 30 .",
    "the observations started at 1:10  ut and were stopped at 3:14  ut due to pointing restrictions , corresponding to a range in planet orbital phase @xmath24 of 0.977 - 0.017 .",
    "this was sufficient to observe a full transit of the planet , with the first contact happening at 1:25  ut and the fourth contact during the last exposure .",
    "the first spectra were taken at airmass greater than 2 with a seeing of 1.2 - 1.4 . at 1:22  ut",
    "the seeing abruptly dropped below 1 , resulting in significantly higher signal - to - noise ratio due to better performances of the ao system . with 60 seconds of exposure time per spectrum",
    ", we collected 45 pairs of ab or ba spectra , of which 39 are during the transit of hd  189733  b.",
    "we utilized the crires pipeline version 2.1.3 for the basic calibration and the extraction of the one - dimensional spectra . on each frame ,",
    "dark - subtraction and flat - field correction were performed by utilizing the standard calibration frames observed the morning after the transit .",
    "an additional non - linearity correction was applied on the science and calibration frames by using the appropriate set of archival data .",
    "each pair of ab or ba frames was subsequently combined in order to subtract the background , and the one - dimensional spectrum was obtained by optimal extraction @xcite .    a difference in gain between odd and even columns is known to affect detectors 1 and 4 ( odd - even effect ) .",
    "a set of calibration files is provided with the pipeline to correct for this effect . however , in all our previous work with crires we noticed that these files are able to correct the odd - even effect in detector # 1 , but not in detector # 4 .",
    "we therefore discard the latter for the rest of this work .",
    "the remainder of the data analysis was performed via custom - built procedures in idl . for each of the crires detectors ,",
    "the extracted 1-d spectra were organized in two - dimensional arrays containing pixel number ( wavelength ) and frame number ( time / phase ) on the horizontal and vertical axes , respectively .",
    "bad - pixels due to cosmic rays and detector cosmetics were corrected as in @xcite , by spline interpolating across isolated pixels or bad columns in the data matrix , by linearly interpolating across 2 - 3 consecutive bad pixels in the spectral direction , and by masking larger groups of bad pixels .      in order to implement our strategy for removing telluric absorption ( see section  [ rm_tell ] ) , the spectra need to be aligned to a common wavelength scale . in previous work @xcite , this task was performed by measuring the centroid position of the telluric lines , by fitting their displacement with respect to a reference spectrum with a linear function in pixel position , and by shifting the spectra back to the reference by spline interpolation .",
    "however , the star  shows absorption lines in the observed wavelength range , subject to a changing doppler shift due to the changing barycentric velocity of the observer and the stellar radial velocity . since these effects could potentially impact the centroid determination , in this work we did not measure the centroids of telluric lines , but we utilized the cross correlation between the data and a template to align and determine the wavelength solution of the data .",
    "the template spectrum contains telluric and stellar lines .",
    "the telluric model was computed via the eso sky calculator with parameters automatically set by the software after selecting the observing night and the time of our observations .",
    "this means that we computed a telluric model for each observed spectrum .",
    "the stellar template only included co lines .",
    "their rest wavelengths @xmath25 were extracted from the hitran database and shifted to the observed wavelengths @xmath26 by applying @xmath27,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the stellar radial velocity , @xmath29 is the speed of light , @xmath30 is the barycentric velocity of the observer , @xmath31 is the systemic velocity , @xmath32 the stellar radial - velocity semi - amplitude , and @xmath24 the planet orbital phase ( @xmath33 at mid - transit )",
    ". the relevant parameters of the system  are listed in table  [ tab_syspar ] .",
    "the co line depth was taken to be equal to the absorption coefficients for a temperature of 5000  k , multiplied by 10@xmath34 , which was found to be a good visual match to the data .",
    "finally , the line profile was set to be a gaussian with fwhm  =  3  kms@xmath3 , which corresponds to a spectral resolution of @xmath35 and unresolved line profiles .",
    "although in section  [ rm_star ] we also need to account for changes in instrumental and stellar line profiles , we found that the alignment algorithm does not require this level of detail .",
    "for each observed spectrum , the global template spectrum was obtained by multiplying the telluric and stellar template constructed as above .",
    "we determined the wavelength solution of each spectrum and each detector by calculating a grid of trial quadratic solutions , which is appropriate for crires data according to the manual . as shown in figure  [ fig_cal ] , each quadratic solution is given by the parabola passing through the wavelengths of the first , middle , and last pixels of the detector ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the starting values were given by the default ( pixel , wavelength ) solution of the crires pipeline .",
    "the parameter space around these three values was sampled using five equally - spaced steps , centered around the initial estimates .",
    "the initial step size was chosen to be 0.2  nm , big enough to encompass all possible solutions .",
    "each of the resulting 125 grid points defines a trial wavelength solution for the data , to which we interpolated the global template .",
    "we then computed the cross correlation with the data , selected the best solution based on the highest cross - correlation , and updated the triplet of wavelengths ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we refined the step size by a factor of 5 ( 0.04 nm ) and repeated the computation .",
    "after 4 iterations , we adopted the best - fitting solution as wavelength solution for our spectrum . in the absence of noise this would give us a precision of @xmath37  nm ( 0.03 pixels ) in the wavelength solution .",
    "we finally aligned all spectra to a common wavelength scale , which we computed by averaging the wavelength solution of all spectra .",
    "the alignment was performed by spline - interpolating each spectrum to the new wavelength scale .      during a large portion of the transit , star and planet",
    "have a similar radial velocity ( to within few kms@xmath3 ) , meaning that spectral features present in both the stellar and the planet spectrum are almost superimposed .",
    "this is the case of the co ladder around 2.3  @xmath38 m , which is a distinctive feature of both the planet and the stellar spectrum .",
    "stellar co lines have depths of 10 - 20% with respect to the continuum , while the typical depth of the planet spectral lines is expected to be 100 - 200 times smaller .",
    "the stellar spectrum can not be normalized in the same way as the telluric spectrum ( see section  [ rm_tell ] ) , because the stellar absorption lines are distorted by the rossiter - mclaughlin ( rm ) effect @xcite . during different phases of a transit , particular parts of the rotating stellar",
    "photosphere are blocked from view , leading to a deformation of the stellar absorption lines .",
    "this deformation and its progress during transit depends on the exact geometry of the transit , which is governed by the projected stellar rotation ( @xmath39 ) , the impact parameter , and the projected angle between the stellar and orbital angular momenta ( see figure  [ fig_rm_effect ] ) .",
    "the rm effect is often used to measure the projected obliquities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and for the case of  good alignment was found @xcite .    for our current investigation the rm effect does however present a nuisance as it causes spurious time - varying signal during transit . for slowly rotating stars like hd189733 , the magnitude of the deformation on the absorption lines roughly scales with ( @xmath40/@xmath41)@xmath42 . the stellar absorption lines are 100 - 200 times stronger than the planetary co lines .",
    "therefore rm effect is roughly of the same order of magnitude as the expected signal from the planetary co absorption and therefore needs to be treated properly .",
    "although the rm effect does not contaminate the spectra of h@xmath11o , ch@xmath19 , and co@xmath11 , we expect co to have an important contribution to the planet spectrum as well , based on previous high - resolution dayside observations of  @xcite .",
    "we therefore decided to model the distortion of the stellar lines during transit , fit the stellar absorption lines in our data , and remove the resulting stellar spectrum from these data , as outlined below .",
    "for computing the rm effect we used the numerical model by @xcite , already applied to eclipsing binary stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and transiting planets @xcite . in short this numerical model",
    "simulates a rotating absorption line kernel assuming solid - body rotation , quadratic limb darkening ( equation  [ eq_starint ] ) , and the macro - turbulence model by @xcite .",
    "solar - like convective blueshift is also included @xcite . the micro turbulence is modeled by a simple gaussian .",
    "the resulting distorted stellar absorption lines , appropriate for a particular transit phase , are then used to convolve the narrow stellar model spectra in the fitting algorithm described below .    for this rm model",
    "we assumed good projected alignment , an orbital inclination of @xmath43 , and solar like blueshift , but with a reduced amplitude of @xmath44  ms@xmath3 , compared to the solar value of @xmath45  ms@xmath3 .",
    "the limb darkening parameters had been set to @xmath46 and @xmath47 , appropriate for a star with @xmath48k , @xmath49cms@xmath50 , and solar metallicity , observed in the @xmath18-band @xcite .",
    "the projected rotation speed @xmath39 , macro turbulence , planet / star radii ratio ( @xmath40/@xmath41 ) , and the micro turbulence have been initially left as free parameters and have been adjusted throughout the procedure described below .",
    "however , since our fit is scarcely influenced by @xmath39  and @xmath40/@xmath41  when varied within their literature uncertainties , we fixed these two parameters to the values listed in table  [ tab_syspar ] .",
    "this allowed us to sensibly reduce the computational time .",
    "we designed an iterative procedure to fit simultaneously for the instrumental profile ( ip ) of crires , for the depth and shape of stellar co lines , and for residual non - co stellar lines .",
    "the fitting algorithm is outlined below and illustrated in figure  [ fig_rm_star ] . in the following ,",
    "we refer to the original spectra as the data after alignment , containing telluric and stellar absorption lines ( panel a ) .    1 .",
    "we divide the original spectra through the doppler - shifted stellar template ( see section  [ align ] ) utilized for the alignment ( panel b ) ; 2 .",
    "we obtain an initial guess for the ip by applying the singular value decomposition algorithm described in @xcite and implemented in @xcite on the residual spectra after step 1 . as narrow template",
    ", we use the same telluric model from the eso sky calculator as in section  [ align ] .",
    "we note a negligible influence of the kernel size chosen to determine the ip on the final result , for sizes between 9 and 21 crires pixels , where a pixel is 1.5  kms@xmath3 .",
    "we choose a kernel size of 19 pixels , corresponding to 4 fwhm of a theoretical gaussian ip at the spectral resolution of 100,000 ; 3 .",
    "we convolve the eso telluric model with the guess ip and we divide the original data through it , obtaining the stellar spectrum plus residual noise from imperfect telluric subtraction ( panel c ) ; 4 .",
    "we obtain a master stellar spectrum by shifting the out - of - transit spectra to the stellar rest frame and co - adding them ( panel d ) ; 5 .",
    "we fit the stellar co lines in the master spectrum by shifting the synthetic stellar line profiles computed above to their doppler - shifted wavelengths ( @xmath26 in section  [ align ] ) , by convolving them with the ip measured during step 2 , and by fitting the correct scaling factor by linear regression .",
    "we find the best - fitting micro - turbulent and macro - turbulent velocities by minimizing the @xmath51 of the residuals ; 6 .",
    "we fit residual non - co stellar lines with gaussian or lorentzian profiles .",
    "these lines are not supposed to produce spurious planetary signal , therefore a precise fitting is not required . the total fitted stellar spectrum ( co and non - co lines )",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig_rm_star ] ( panel e ) ; 7 .",
    "we repeat steps 1 - 6 iteratively until the ip , the minimum @xmath51 , and the best - fit parameters converge .",
    "this is typically achieved after 3 iterations .",
    "at point 1 , we substitute the stellar template utilized in section  [ align ] with the fitted stellar spectrum after steps 5 and 6 .",
    "we divide the original data through the fitted stellar model , which includes the non - co lines fitted during step 6 above , and the modeled rm effect for the co lines and in - transit spectra .",
    "the best - fit stellar line profile is convolved with the ip measured as above , shifted to the observed frequency accounting for the barycentric velocity of the observer and the stellar radial velocity , and scaled by the measured amplitude .",
    "an example of our data before and after the removal of the stellar spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig_rm_star ] ( panel f ) .",
    "spots on a rotating stellar photosphere are capable of distorting the stellar line profile depending on their longitude and latitude .",
    "since we do not model this effect , our fit might be partially incorrect , leading to small residuals within @xmath52@xmath39  and + @xmath39  from the stellar radial velocity .",
    "we demonstrate below that , due to the nature and amplitude of the line distortion caused by star spots , their effect is negligible for this study .    in the first place it is useful to estimate the amplitude of these distortions . @xcite",
    "estimated a spot coverage of 1% at any moment for the star hd  189733 , based on optical multi - band photometric variability .",
    "the spot temperature was estimated by @xcite to be 500 - 1000  k colder than the photosphere ( @xmath53  k ) .",
    "we adopted @xmath54  k and consequently a spot temperature of @xmath55  k. with these values , the maximum effect of spots at 2.3  is @xmath56 relative to the depth of a stellar line , if the continuum and the spots are approximated with black bodies emitting at temperatures @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "for an average co line depth of 15  % , these residuals have amplitudes of @xmath59 compared to the stellar continuum , which is at least @xmath60 smaller than the weaker co lines in the planet transmission spectrum .",
    "furthermore , in doppler space the nature of this spurious signal is substantially different from the planet absorption , and largely canceled prior to cross - correlation .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that hd 189733 is a slow rotator with a rotational period close to 13 days .",
    "thus any configuration of spots can be considered static during one single transit observation ( less than 2 hours ) . compared to the observer ,",
    "the star moves in radial velocity by only 0.2  kms@xmath3  during the transit ( mostly due to the change in barycentric velocity ) , which is only 1/15 of the full width half maximum of the crires ip .",
    "this means that any distortion of the stellar lines caused by unocculted spots is static in both radial velocity and time . in this case",
    "our data analysis designed to remove telluric lines ( section  [ rm_tell ] ) will also re - normalize residuals from uncorrected star spots , further dampening the already small signal .",
    "however , we know from past transit observations @xcite that hd  189733  b usually crosses some spots during transit . in this case , the distortion of the stellar line suddenly disappears ( when the spot is occulted ) and reappears , generating a pulse radial velocity signal in the data , uncorrected by our analysis .",
    "the duration of this pulse is dependent on the size of the crossed spot ( or region of spots ) .",
    "although probably unrealistic , we discuss the worst - case scenario in which all spots are clustered in a region of radius 0.1  @xmath41  ( based on the  1% coverage and spots significantly darker than the photosphere ) . for an impact parameter of @xmath61 ,",
    "the length of the chord crossed by the planet is 1.5 stellar radii . with 39 frames observed in transit , the planet crosses 0.038 stellar radii per frame .",
    "this unrealistically big group of spots would therefore affect 2.6 frames of our data .",
    "for a spot signal 1/10 of the planet signal , occulted star spots can only contaminate 8% of the detected co signal , or @xmath62 based on the detection presented in section  [ onegas ] .",
    "we therefore conclude that - at least in the case of hd 189733 b - the contamination due to uncorrected star spots is negligible .",
    "telluric lines change in depth during the observations , but not in position .",
    "therefore , the telluric spectrum is most effectively removed by modeling the flux of each data column ( i.e. , each wavelength channel ) in time .",
    "the main cause of telluric variation is the change in geometric airmass .",
    "changes in the ip ( due to , e.g. , in - slit guiding , seeing , and performances of the adaptive optics ) , as well as changes in the water vapor content in the earth s atmosphere could also affect the flux in the core of telluric lines .",
    "we initially normalize each spectrum by its median continuum level .",
    "we then model the time - variation of the flux in each spectral channel via the simple functional form : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the geometric airmass , and we divide through the fit .",
    "the coefficients @xmath65-@xmath66 are determined by linear regression for each of the spectral channels in the data .",
    "we investigated more complex functional forms for @xmath67 , but since the gain in total planet signal was marginal , we preferred to keep the most conservative and least invasive decorrelation .",
    "we divide each spectral channel by its variance , which is required because the data have been re - normalized and we therefore need to restore the initial s / n of each spectral channel through an additional weighting . finally , we apply a high - pass filter to each spectrum by computing and dividing through a smoothed version ( boxcar of width 64 pixels ) .",
    "we note that the approach described above partially differs from previous work @xcite .",
    "there we preferred to fit a first - order airmass dependence , sample higher - order residuals directly from the data , and determine their linear combination that best matched @xmath67 .",
    "this method is particularly effective when planet molecular lines have depths well below the level of the noise in the data . in this case ,",
    "molecular lines in the transmission spectrum of  are expected to be as deep as @xmath68 relative to the stellar continuum , which is close to the typical noise levels of these data ( average s / n = 270 per spectrum ) . sampling the residuals from the data",
    "is therefore not advisable , because we would likely include and consequently remove part of the planet signal as well .",
    "after removing the stellar and telluric lines as explained in sections  [ rm_star ] and [ rm_tell ] , we extracted the planet signal by cross correlating the data with model spectra for the planet atmosphere . in this way we combined all the spectral lines of the planet in a single cross - correlation function ( ccf ) , increasing the signal by a factor of @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the number of strong molecular lines .",
    "we computed the cross correlation with both narrow and broadened atmospheric models .",
    "the former are the output of our radiative transfer calculations described in section  [ atm_models ] , which do not account for atmospheric circulation or rotational broadening .",
    "the latter are the narrow models convolved with the broadening profiles described in section  [ broad_models ] .",
    "the transmission spectrum of hd  189733  b was modeled by following the same prescriptions of @xcite concerning the choice of line lists for co and h@xmath11o  @xcite , ch@xmath19  @xcite , line profiles , and collision - induced absorption by hydrogen @xcite . the line list for co@xmath11  was instead taken from @xcite .",
    "we described the terminator atmosphere of the planet by assuming an average temperature - pressure ( @xmath71 ) profile .",
    "the lower part of the planet atmosphere ( @xmath72 bar ) can not be probed by transmission spectroscopy .",
    "any chosen @xmath71 profile would essentially produce the same modeled transmission spectrum .",
    "therefore , we chose to match the @xcite profile , which is derived from secondary - eclipse measurement of the planet , with the simplest possible sampling . for @xmath73",
    "bar , an isothermal atmosphere at temperature 1750  k was adopted . between 1 and 0.1  bar ,",

    "we note , however , that this analysis has several limitations in this particular case , leading to underestimated planet signals and complicating the measurement of rotational and winds parameters . in the first place ,",
    "cross correlating with model spectra with a wide range of broadening changes the level of correlation between the points of the ccf , which is sampled at a fixed resolution of 1.5  kms@xmath3 .",
    "secondly , the peak of the ccf alone can not encode the richness of the planet signal .",
    "the planet ccf shows strong negative wings ( see bottom panels of figure  [ fig_moldet ] ) .",
    "this is in part due to the autocorrelation function , and in part it is a known side effect of our strategy for removing telluric lines , already noted by @xcite . in the presence of strong planet absorption lines ,",
    "the fit of the flux as a function of airmass is biased towards slightly lower values .",
    "therefore , when dividing through the fit , we obtain excess residuals around each planet line , which generate the wings once summed in time .",
    "in addition to wings , the planet ccf shows asymmetries , autocorrelation for non - zero rest velocities , etc .",
    "all these effects are neglected if relying on the peak value of the ccf alone .",
    "lastly , the cross correlation is a broadening operator , conceptually similar to a convolution .",
    "this means that the peak value of a ccf is naturally maximized when cross - correlating with the narrowest possible templates .",
    "this would bias our analysis to favor narrow ( i.e. , without rotation ) planet models , affecting the determination of the planet rotational rate .",
    "a broader ccf would also reduce the precision in determining parameters uncorrelated with the width of the planet line profile , namely the maximum planet orbital velocity  @xmath129  and the rest - frame velocity  @xmath141 .",
    "all these limitations are indeed seen and verified in these data , and we briefly describe them in section  [ results ] ( and sub - sections ) . to overcome the limitations of the above analysis",
    ", we have developed a novel signal retrieval based on @xmath51 statistics , which we describe below .",
    "for each value of @xmath129 , we cross - correlate the data with the narrow atmospheric model ( i.e. , without including the broadening due to planet rotation and atmospheric circulation ) , according to a lag vector centered on the planet radial velocity ( equation  [ eq_pl_rv ] ) , and spanning @xmath142  kms@xmath3  around it , in steps of 1.5  kms@xmath3 .",
    "since the ccf is already centered on the planet rest - frame velocity , we obtain the total ccf by simply co - adding in time .",

    ", we expect the cross - correlation values to be distributed as a gaussian with mean zero .",
    "that is equivalent to fitting the ccf with a straight line and zero offset .",
    "the associated goodness of fit test requires the computation of the following @xmath51 : @xmath143 where the sum is computed for @xmath144  kms@xmath3  to ensure that we are only including data potentially altered by planetary signal .",
    "this corresponds to 51 cross - correlation values , or 50 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) . in the equation above @xmath145",
    "is the variance of the ccf computed for rest - frame velocities greater than 37.5  kms@xmath3 .",
    "we compute the p - value from @xmath146 , that is the probability of measuring a value higher than @xmath146",
    ". it can be obtained from the cumulative density function of a chi - square distribution with @xmath147 degrees of freedom , cdf@xmath148 : @xmath149 we finally translate this probability into sigma intervals @xmath150 by using a normal distribution .",
    "we use a two - tail test , since by definition the @xmath51 includes both negative and positive deviations around the mean .",
    "the quantity @xmath150 tells us how much our ccf deviates from a gaussian distribution , regardless of the source of the signal ( astrophysical or instrumental ) .",
    "if the signal is originated from the atmosphere of , it also embeds any broadening due to rotation and/or atmospheric circulation .",
    "however , as explained at the end of section  [ snr_analysis ] , we want to avoid directly cross correlating with broadened models , because that would change the statistical properties ( i.e. , the level of correlation ) of the cross - correlation values .    instead of cross correlating with the broadened model ,",
    "we inject it at 10% the nominal level on top of the real data , prior to removing the stellar and telluric lines .",
    "this ensures that the injected signal will be processed exactly as the real signal by our data analysis . after processing and cross - correlating the data with the narrow model , for the same choice of @xmath129  and lag vectors as above , we take the difference between the ccfs of the injected and real data : @xmath151 since the model signal was injected at a small level , the ccf noise is not significantly altered by the injection .",
    "this was tested by visually inspecting the data before and after the injection , and by comparing the noise variance , which resulted identical to within 0.1% .",
    "therefore , the difference @xmath152ccf is essentially noiseless and provides a good estimator for the cross - correlation function of a real planet signal with the same parameters ( @xmath129 , @xmath153 , @xmath116 ) used for the injection , except for a scaling factor and ( possibly ) an offset .",

    "this approach based on @xmath51 has the advantage that the whole shape of the ccf , and not only its peak value , is taken into account .",

    "figure  [ fig_prot_kp_veq ] ( bottom panel ) shows the detection significance as function of ( @xmath153 , @xmath116 ) , and for the best - fit @xmath129 .",
    "our data do not show any preference for equatorial super - rotation , with the 1-@xmath1 upper limit spanning the entire tested range .",
    "finally , our best - fit model broadened by the best - fit parameters peaks at @xmath141  =  @xmath5  kms@xmath3 , inconsistent with strong high - altitude winds flowing from the dayside to the night - side of the planet .",
    "the implications of these measurements are discussed below .",
    "the best - fitting parameters of  are summarized in table  [ tab_syspar ] .",
    "we note that the s / n analysis leads to qualitatively similar results concerning rotation and winds .",
    "it shows no preference for equatorial super - rotation , a small day - to - night side wind speed ( section  [ best_model ] ) , and a preference for slow planet rotation , although the error bars on the latter are considerably bigger ( @xmath114@xmath180 days at 1@xmath1 ) .",
    "moreover , although the s / n is maximized for @xmath114  =  2.0  days , longer rotational periods are totally unconstrained .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the cross correlation is a broadening operator .",
    "therefore , the peak value of the cross correlation function is naturally maximized when using the narrowest possible model , which in our case is the planet model spectrum without any broadenings . due to this bias ,",
    "the s / n analysis favors longer rotational periods , which further motivates the choice of a more robust and unbiased analysis based on injection of artificial signal , their processing identical to the real data , and the comparison between the ccfs of the injected and the real data supported by @xmath51 statistics .",
    "the analysis of high - dispersion transmission spectra of  around 2.3  resulted in the detection of h@xmath11o  and co absorption at a combined s / n of 7.0 , or a significance of 7.6@xmath1 , depending on our two retrieval methods utilized .",
    "the model that best matches the shape of the observed cross - correlation function is broadened by a planet rotational velocity of @xmath153  =  @xmath2  kms@xmath3 , corresponding to a rotational period of @xmath114  =  @xmath4  days .",
    "we exclude at the 3-@xmath1 level that  rotates in less than 1 day ( @xmath153  @xmath181  5.9  kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "if the empirical ( mass , rotational period ) relation observed for the bodies in the solar system @xcite can be extended to extrasolar planets as suggested by @xcite , the rotation of  must have slowed considerably from its expected value in the absence of tidal effects .",
    "our data are indeed consistent with tidal locking to the parent star ( @xmath153  =  2.7  kms@xmath3 , @xmath114  =  2.2 days ) .",
    "however , our best - fitting model is only marginally favored ( 1.5@xmath1 ) with respect to models with no rotational broadening .    beside planet bulk rotation , we were able to investigate the presence of two main patterns of atmospheric dynamics for this hot jupiter , namely equatorial super - rotation and global day - to - night side winds along the terminator .",
    "we were unable to constrain the former , as equatorial velocities up to 10  kms@xmath3  in excess with respect to the planet bulk rotational velocity are equally favored in a @xmath51 sense .",
    "we can not determine if this limitation is due to insufficient s / n , to a too simplistic implementation of eastward jet streams in our model ( section  [ broad_models ] ) , or to a combination of both .",
    "future efforts will be put into this matter , as low - resolution ir observations do detect a phase shift for the maximum thermal emission from the planet , meaning that the atmosphere at the sub - stellar point is significantly advected eastward by equatorial jets .",
    "we note that low- and high - resolution spectroscopy probe different pressure levels , with the former targeting the bulk thermal emission from the planet ( close to the continuum level , and typically at pressures of 1.0 - 0.1 bar ) , while the latter traces the contrast between the planet radius measured in the continuum and that in the core of molecular lines , resulting in an effective pressure range of 10@xmath50 - 10@xmath182 bar .",
    "we detect a small blue - shift of the planet cross - correlation function , as the signal is maximized at a planet rest - frame velocity of @xmath5  kms@xmath3 .",
    "this is only 1.4-@xmath1 deviant from zero wind speed , but differs significantly ( 2.7@xmath1 ) from the detection reported by @xcite of na absorption blue shifted by @xmath183  kms@xmath3 .",
    "however , they probe much higher altitudes ( up to 14,000 km ) and lower pressures ( down to 10@xmath184 bars ) than these nir observations .",
    "we therefore suggest that these observations target two different circulation regimes , and that the two measurements indicate the presence of a strong wind shear between the lower and upper part of the atmosphere of .",
    "this also seems to be the outcome of numerical calculations in both @xcite ( their figure  4 ) and @xcite ( their figure  7 ) , although a more quantitative assessment is needed , for instance by integrating the velocity field along the terminator at two different pressure levels .",
    "we note that the same optical data of @xcite have been independently analyzed by @xcite , accounting for the effect of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect on the stellar sodium lines .",
    "they found a blue shift of only 1.9@xmath185 , which is consistent with our measurement and would suggest almost no vertical wind shear .",
    "we showed that stellar residuals , and in particular the rossiter - mclaughlin effect , are capable of dominating , shielding and possibly contaminating the planet signal .",
    "we demonstrated that spurious signals can be filtered out to a certain extent by investigating the full shape of the cross - correlation function , and not only its peak value . for future high - dispersion observations of exoplanet atmospheres , we strongly advise to explore the shifted and co - added cross - correlation function ( or more generally a shifted and co - added planet spectrum ) for a range of planet orbital radial velocities , and not just at the planet rest - frame velocity .",
    "if a spurious signal ( either telluric or stellar ) is present in the data , the total cross correlation function will peak at low or zero planet orbital velocities , and at rest - frame velocities equal to the combination of the systemic velocity of the targeted system and the barycentric velocity of the observer . in that case , a modeling and subtraction of the stellar spectrum , or a better removal of telluric lines should be investigated and applied , before the results can be trusted .",
    "we note that these transit data are less effective than previous dayside observations @xcite in constraining the amplitude of the planet orbital radial velocity ( @xmath129 ) , resulting in much larger error bars .",
    "this is a logical consequence of the much smaller change in planet orbital phase and radial velocity during transit . in the case of  it",
    "is further influenced by the relatively high impact parameter at which the transit occurs .",
    "this lowers the strength of the planet signal during the first and last part of the transit , which is where the planet radial velocity differs the most from zero and would therefore provide the best constraints on @xmath129 . however , in this case we do know the planet orbital radial velocity because the orbit of  is well constrained by both stellar radial velocities and transit observations ( see parameters in table  [ tab_syspar ] ) . therefore ,",
    "differently from non - transiting planets , our aim is not to precisely determine the planet motion .    in conclusion",
    ", we have demonstrated that ground - based , high - resolution spectroscopy can be successfully utilized to constrain the planet rotation and atmospheric dynamics of evolved hot jupiters . in the future , we plan to apply more realistic velocity fields to the planet terminator , thus deriving estimates of physical quantities such as drag forces and day - night temperature contrasts from the measured wind velocities ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the typical pressures probed by nir , high - dispersion spectroscopy are intermediate between those accessible at lower resolution and those measured through high - dispersion spectroscopy in the optical .",
    "all these techniques are therefore highly complementary and should potentially be combined to get the maximum information on the vertical thermal and dynamical structure of hot - jupiter atmosphere . by introducing chi - square analysis for retrieving signal at high spectral resolution , we hope to open up this spectral regime to powerful retrieval methods based on bayesian analysis ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the possibility of combining in a homogeneous fashion data at low and high spectral resolution will reinforce the synergy between space and ground observations in the jwst / e - elt era .",
