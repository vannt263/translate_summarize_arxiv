    "despite the fact that qcd has been with us since the discovery of asymptotic freedom @xcite around 1973 there are still subtle issues that hunger for an explanation .",
    "this includes the mechanism of color confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "color confinement causes the quarks to be bound inside hadrons while chiral symmetry breaking is the source of the lightness of the pions being the associated ( pseudo ) nambu - goldstone bosons @xcite of the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "a few nonperturbative and exact results are known about chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "for instance coleman and witten have shown that under reasonable assumptions the chiral symmetry group must break down to its diagonal subgroup in the limit of a large number of colors @xcite .",
    "another important result has been derived by vafa and witten who showed that in parity - conserving theories ( such as qcd ) parity can not be spontaneously broken @xcite .",
    "understanding the dynamics of massless qcd is of course of vital importance but the massiveness of the pions forces us to study the system including small perturbations .",
    "the fact that the pions are light ( but nonzero ) is due to the quarks requiring an explicit mass thereby explicitly breaking the chiral symmetry . the explicit symmetry breaking causes the vacuum degeneracy to be lifted and the associated nambu - goldstone bosons become massive .",
    "one can imagine that this small mass perturbation drives the vacuum of the system in a new direction , i.e. the vacuum of the theory will align with the perturbation . in which direction the vacuum will align will depend on the details and nature of the perturbation .",
    "the study of this vacuum alignment phenomena in qcd was first done by dashen @xcite who found a very interesting result . for three quarks ( up , down and strange ) where all three quark masses are negative , the up and down quark masses are degenerate and the numerical value of the up and down quark masses are not too big compared to the numerical value of the strange quark mass the vacuum aligns in a direction in which the combined symmetry of charge conjugation and parity , cp , is spontaneously broken @xcite .",
    "since the scale of this cp violation would be the scale of chiral symmetry breaking it is clear that this can not be the source of the observed cp violation in nature . some time after the work of dashen it was suggested by eichten , lane and preskill that within the technicolor framework of physics beyond the standard model a similar mechanism could account for the observed cp violation @xcite .",
    "additional work can be found in @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the procedure for generating the observed cp violation in the standard model is very similar to the one originally performed by dashen @xcite .",
    "hence besides being a fascinating phenomena within qcd vacuum alignment has also found its relevance in other branches of high energy physics .    in qcd for two and three flavors it has been studied in detail by m. creutz and collaborators in a series of papers @xcite . for a larger number of flavors",
    "there has been little work done .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to study the alignment of the vacuum when the matter sector consists of four flavors or higher .",
    "as already mentioned one of the most intriguing observations for three flavors is the fact that there is a region in parameter space where cp is spontaneously broken .",
    "this is distinct from the two flavor case where only a single point in the parameter space ( where the up quark mass is equal to minus the down quark mass ) can yield spontaneous cp violation . whether this phenomenon continues to occur for a larger number of flavors is still an open question .",
    "as will be clear in the following when minimizing the energy of the system the existence of a nontrivial solution ( where cp is broken ) depends highly on the number of flavors .",
    "we will see at the point where @xmath6 flavors are degenerate with positive masses @xmath7 and the mass of the @xmath0th flavor becomes negative and equal to @xmath8 cp breaks spontaneously for both three and four flavors .",
    "we are then able to show that this happens for any number of flavors . in other words",
    "it is sufficient for cp to be violated that only the mass of a single flavor becomes negative and equal to @xmath8 for any number of flavors .",
    "as one varies the number of flavors the phases with spontaneous cp violation are smoothly connected .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : vacalignment ] we discuss vacuum alignment in generality and in section [ sec : symmetries ] we discuss the global and discrete symmetries that may or may not be broken . in section [ sec : results ] we review the case of two and three flavors and present new results for four flavors and an arbitrary number of flavors .",
    "we finally conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we begin our discussion of vacuum alignment following and generalizing the original work of dashen @xcite . for",
    "now we shall not commit ourselves to a specific theory but consider generic asymptotically free nonsupersymmetric gauge theories with a set of massless fermions belonging to some representation of the gauge group .",
    "the hamiltonian of the theory is denoted as @xmath10 and we shall assume that it possesses a global symmetry @xmath11 .",
    "in general the global symmetry depends on the representation to which the fermions belong @xcite .",
    "we also imagine picking the number of flavors to be less than the critical value needed to reach an infrared fixed point @xcite .    then at a certain energy scale",
    "the gauge interactions become strong and spontaneously break the global symmetry @xmath11 to a subgroup @xmath12 .",
    "even though the hamiltonian @xmath10 is invariant under @xmath11 the ground state of the theory is invariant only under @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are unitary representations of the group elements @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "similar to the fact that @xmath18 is a ground state of the theory so is @xmath19 since they both have the same energy @xmath20 here we have used the fact that the hamiltonian is invariant under all group transformations and therefore specifically under transformations @xmath17 .",
    "the ground state is therefore not unique .",
    "instead the theory contains an infinite number of vacua @xmath21 parameterized by all the transformations @xmath17 .",
    "one should note that there is nothing special about the ground state @xmath22 compared to the others .",
    "it is just to be understood as some standard reference vacuum corresponding to a particular transformation @xmath23 .",
    "it is a well known fact that the above vacuum degeneracy is manifested in the presence of a set of massless nambu - goldstone bosons corresponding to the number of broken generators of the global symmetry .",
    "however out of the infinite number of vacua is there any way that we can determine which one to pick and from which we should build our particle states , etc . ?",
    "let us now imagine that to the hamiltonian @xmath10 we add a small perturbation @xmath24 which explicitly breaks the global symmetry @xmath11 .",
    "the explicit symmetry breaking will cause the vacuum degeneracy to be either partially or completely lifted .",
    "the vacuum ( vacua ) that remains in the theory is ( are ) said to be aligned with the explicit symmetry breaking term .    to find the correct ( aligned ) vacuum we need to minimize the energy @xmath25 over all vacua of the unperturbed theory . as discussed above the first term",
    "is just a constant and independent of the specific vacua we consider .",
    "therefore when finding the correct ( aligned ) vacuum we only need to consider the minimization of the second term ( which we shall also denote by @xmath26 .",
    "this should not cause any confusion . )",
    "@xmath27    so far we have discussed vacuum alignment in the passive picture in which we keep the hamiltonian fixed and act on the set of degenerate ground states by unitary transformations . in this way one finds the aligned vacuum state compatible with the hamiltonian . on the other hand one could equally well fix the ground state and then act on the hamiltonian by unitary transformations .",
    "this is the active picture .",
    "switching from the passive to the active picture is straightforward .",
    "first let us write the part of the total energy we want to minimize as @xmath28 the above procedure of finding the vacuum @xmath29 that minimizes the energy with respect to some fixed hamiltonian @xmath24 now translates into finding the rotated hamiltonian @xmath30 that minimizes the energy with respect to some fixed ground state @xmath31 where @xmath32 for the remaining part of this work we shall use both the passive and active picture and choose the one which is most convenient for us in order to illustrate various points and issues .",
    "fermionic gauge theories enjoy global symmetries @xmath11 depending on the representation to which the fermions belong @xcite . if the representation is complex the theory possesses a continuous global symmetry @xmath33 where @xmath0 counts the number of dirac fermions .",
    "also @xmath34 is anomaly free and is the standard baryon number .",
    "in addition to the above continuous global symmetries a theory might also possess a set of discrete symmetries .",
    "of particular interest is parity @xmath35 which exchanges left - handedness and right - handedness , charge conjugation @xmath36 which transforms a particle into its antiparticle and time reversal @xmath37 .    in order to discuss their implementation on various fields",
    "let us write a four - component dirac fermion as @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the two left and right handed weyl components . under parity , charge conjugation and time reversal they transform as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is an arbitrary phase .",

    "this is the celebrated @xmath43-theorem @xcite .",
    "for instance it implies that if @xmath44 is preserved ( violated ) then @xmath37 is also preserved ( violated ) . invoking the @xmath43-theorem it therefore suffices to study only the possible realizations of parity @xmath35 , charge conjugation @xmath36 and the combined @xmath44 symmetry .",

    "we denote the dirac fermions as @xmath53 the fermions also carry a gauge index which we have suppressed .",
    "the lagrangian of the theory is @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the gauge coupling and @xmath56 denotes the dimension of the adjoint representation of the gauge group . from the lagrangian @xmath57 we can easily construct the hamiltonian @xmath10 .",
    "the theory enjoys a continuous global symmetry @xmath58 where the abelian @xmath34 is anomaly free and is identified with the standard baryon number .",
    "in addition to the continuous symmetry the theory is also separately invariant under parity @xmath35 , charge conjugation @xmath36 and time reversal @xmath37 .",
    "at last we note that if one picks the gauge group to be @xmath59 and the representation @xmath60 to be the fundamental representation the theory is simply ordinary massless qcd with @xmath0 flavors .",
    "next we imagine that the gauge interactions become strong at a certain energy scale triggering the formation of the condensate @xmath61 where we have absorbed a possible complex phase into the fields such that @xmath62 .",

    "the perturbation breaks the global symmetry @xmath75 explicitly .",
    "the next step is then to find the aligned vacuum by minimizing eq .",
    "[ complexenergy ] .",

    "second , since @xmath77 must be unitary both @xmath78 and @xmath79 must be pure phases .",
    "in addition since the determinant of @xmath77 must be equal to one this demands that @xmath80 where @xmath81 is some integer .",
    "this last condition we shall enforce by a lagrange multiplier .",
    "the aligned vacuum must therefore be of the form @xmath82 with @xmath83 we have to minimize the energy over the two angles @xmath84 and @xmath85 under the constraint that they must add to @xmath86 .",
    "the extrema conditions follow quite simply and reads @xmath87 hence we are looking for solutions to @xmath88 . if @xmath89 they are located at @xmath90 . then if @xmath91 they are global minima of the energy for even @xmath92 and global maxima of the energy for odd @xmath92 . on the other hand if @xmath93 they are global minima of the energy for odd @xmath92 and global maxima of the energy for even @xmath92 .",
    "lastly if @xmath94 there exists a continuum of vacua all parameterized by an angle @xmath95 and the energy vanishes identically .",

    "it equals @xmath98 if @xmath99 is positive and @xmath100 if @xmath99 is negative .",
    "hence for @xmath101 the vacuum degeneracy is lifted and only a single vacuum proportional to the identity remains .",
    "in other words all three nambu - goldstone bosons have become massive with masses proportional to @xmath102 .",
    "now as we vary the quark masses and reach the point where @xmath103 the degeneracy appears again being parameterized by an angle @xmath104 .",
    "this should not come as a big surprise since at this point the nambu - goldstone bosons will again appear massless .",
    "we also note one interesting possibility discussed in a series of papers @xcite .",

    "in @xcite it has been argued that at this point the neutral pion field becomes massless and condenses forming a spontaneous cp violating phase .",
    "we shall not speculate more on this possibility .",
    "let us now review the case of @xmath4 dirac flavors with a mass perturbation @xmath108 where all eigenvalues are taken to be real such it preserves cp .",
    "the perturbation breaks the global symmetry explicitly where the pattern of symmetry breaking depends on the nature of the eigenvalues .",

    "assuming that the energy is minimized when all the cosine factors are equal to @xmath100 implies that the each angle must be equal to an odd multiple of @xmath117 .",
    "however then they do not add up to an even multiple of @xmath117 as they should .",
    "a similar argument can be given if only a single mass is negative while the remaining two are positive .",

    "therefore the correct aligned vacuum is @xmath144 with @xmath145 the vacuum breaks cp invariance spontaneously .",
    "this is a quite remarkable situation first observed by dashen @xcite in which we add a small perturbation to a theory that preserves cp and automatically the vacuum is tilted in a direction in which cp breaks spontaneously .",
    "it should be noted that dashen originally observed this phenomenon for the case where all three masses are negative and @xmath146 .",
