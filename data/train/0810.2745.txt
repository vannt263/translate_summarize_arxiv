    "in seismic processing , migration of seismic data is an exercise of paramount importance .",
    "unless this aspect of processing is addressed satisfactorily , the possibility of making misleading estimates of subsurface depths remains wide open .",
    "even by a simple quantitative estimate it can be shown that in many cases the error in the spatial measurement of the true reflector position could be of the order of a kilometre  @xcite .",
    "naturally , when it comes to exploring hydrocarbon reserves , this lack of precision will translate into a huge and wasted monetary expense .",
    "so an accurate representation of the depth and the local dip of subsurface reflectors is imperative .",
    "migration of seismic data goes a long way in resolving this most difficult question  @xcite",
    ".    it should be useful for any study on the relevance of migration to start with a simple and pedagogic understanding of reflection seismology  @xcite , whose primary purpose is to find the depths to reflecting interfaces and the corresponding seismic velocities of subsurface rock layers .",
    "this process first necessitates the artificial generation of mechanical waves at predetermined times and spatial positions on the surface of the earth .",
    "these waves pass through various earth layers and are reflected from the subsurface interfaces back to the surface of the earth , where they are recorded by receivers .",
    "for immediate purposes , the waves of interest are compressional ( longitudinal ) waves , which are also referred to as primary waves  @xcite .",
    "considering the simplest possible case of this system , one might suppose the surface of the earth to be absolutely flat .",
    "from this surface a single source is creating waves which travel through the subsurface and are subsequently reflected back to the surface from a single stratum that is also equally flat .",
    "this has been schematically represented in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . in this simple situation",
    "it is possible to set down the geometrical locus for the physical raypath in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane , with @xmath0 defining the source - to - receiver position , and with the receiver itself gathering reflected signals after an interval of time , @xmath1 .            to that end the pythagoras theorem",
    "may be applied to the triangle @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , under the prescription that @xmath3 , @xmath4 ( the vertical depth of the reflecting interface from the surface of the earth ) , and @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 being the constant velocity of the waves propagating through the subsurface )",
    ". followed by some simple algebraic manipulations , this exercise will deliver the @xmath0@xmath1 locus corresponding to the actual raypath , known also as the _ normal moveout equation _",
    "@xcite , as @xmath7 which is an expression that very recognisably bears the canonical form of a hyperbola , with the parameter @xmath8 having been defined as @xmath9 .",
    "the solution given by eq .",
    "( [ hyper1 ] ) has been geometrically depicted by the continuous curve in fig .",
    "[ f15 ] . from the plot",
    "it may also be appreciated that different values of @xmath10 , as a parameter in eq .",
    "( [ hyper1 ] ) , will yield a family of hyperbolae ( assuming that @xmath6 retains the same constant value all through ) .",
    "the turning points , the maxima in this case , of this family of hyperbolae ( represented by the single continuous curve in fig .  [ f15 ] ) , obtained under the condition @xmath11 , will correspond to the coordinate @xmath12 in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane . and for any fixed value of @xmath0 in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane , the entire range of points along the @xmath1 axis ( with @xmath1 customarily having been scaled along the vertical direction ) , cutting down the entire family of hyperbolae , will define what is known in seismic processing terms as a _ seismic trace _  @xcite .",
    "recast in a slightly different form , eq .",
    "( [ hyper1 ] ) will read as @xmath13 in which @xmath8 can physically be seen to represent the  echo time \"  the two - way travel time for the wave , corresponding to a vertical reflection from the subsurface reflector .",
    "the term under the square root sign is the _ normal moveout _ factor , which appears because the wave reaching the receiver at a distance @xmath0 from the shot point ( i.e. the location of the source ) , has not been reflected vertically  @xcite . under the condition",
    "that the receiver distance , @xmath0 , is much less than the reflector depth , @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath14 , it is a matter of some simple algebraic steps to arrive at an approximate solution ( through a binomial expansion ) for the normal moveout , @xmath15 , as @xmath16    the primary objective here is to determine the depth , @xmath10 , of the reflector .",
    "the vertical echo time , @xmath8 , and the normal moveout time , @xmath17 , can be obtained from the reflection data . the corresponding receiver distance , @xmath0 , will also be known from the data . taken together ,",
    "all of these will allow for determining the value of @xmath6 from eq .",
    "( [ nmo ] ) .",
    "this , with the help of the definition of @xmath8 , will subsequently also allow for the determination of @xmath10 .",
    "in all of this there is a clear signal that a precise extraction of the value of @xmath6 from the reflection data is a principal necessity in determining the reflector depth accurately .",
    "even the simplest possible case that is being studied here emphasises this fact . knowing the precise value of the velocity will be an equally important issue when one considers more complicated instances of reflection seismology involving non - horizontal reflectors of continually varying gradients . besides this , with @xmath6 being dependent on the elastic properties of the material through which the wave propagates  @xcite , getting a correct measure of the velocity also conveys an impression of the true nature of the subsurface material .",
    "it is scarcely to be expected that the layering of actual geological strata will conform to the neat and orderly picture implied by fig .",
    "if anything , not only will the subsurface strata be quite great in number ( instead of the single stratum shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) , but also each stratum will have complex gradients in space .",
    "this will cause for much difficulty in devising an accurate theoretical model for the physics of reflection seismics .",
    "this fact can be amply illustrated even by considering the very simple case of a single dipping interface with a constant spatial gradient .        when the reflecting interface is inclined at a constant angle @xmath18 , with respect to the horizontal , as it has been shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , it will be necessary to make suitable modifications in the analysis presented in section  [ sec1 ] , to retain the canonical form of the hyperbolic normal moveout equation that eq .",
    "( [ hyper1 ] ) represents .",
    "this can indeed be achieved by noting in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] that the perpendicular distance from the source to the reflector , @xmath19 , the source - to - receiver distance , @xmath20 , and the total travel path , @xmath21 . with this information , even upon accounting for the dip in the reflector , the invariant canonical form of the hyperbola can be obtained as @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 being defined by the transformations , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .    from eq .",
    "( [ hyper2 ] ) , the coordinates of the maximum point of the hyperbola @xmath27 in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane ( with @xmath1 increasing in the downward direction ) will be given by the condition @xmath11 .",
    "this will place the peak of the hyperbola at @xmath28 .",
    "going back to the case of the horizontal reflector @xmath29 , given by eq .",
    "( [ hyper1 ] ) , the peak of the hyperbola here is to be seen at @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , a distinct shift is seen to arise because of the dip of the subsurface reflector , and this shift has been shown by the position of the dotted hyperbola in fig .",
    "[ f15 ] .",
    "the locus of this shift can also be traced on the @xmath0@xmath1 plane .",
    "noting that the coordinates of the maximum of the normal moveout hyperbola are given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , one could , by making use of the standard trigonometric result , @xmath32 , derive the condition , @xmath33 the form of this conic section is that of an ellipse . from this",
    "it is now possible to conclude that the peak of the normal moveout curve will trace an elliptical trajectory in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane , with a continuous change in the dip angle , @xmath18 .",
    "while this entire algebraic exercise looks very elegant in principle , it fails hopelessly in addressing a serious practical problem .",
    "the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ hyper2 ] ) has been done with the help of a single source - receiver pair . it _ assumes _ that every source - receiver pair in a full array of sources and receivers will have a _",
    "common _ point of reflection from the inclined subsurface . _ a priori _ this is not possible to achieve in practice .",
    "if anything , for a realistic arrangement of source - receiver arrays , _ each source - receiver pair will have its own particular reflection point_. therefore , unlike the simple representation in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , there will be no common depth point vertically below the common midpoint of the source receiver arrays . being unmindful of this crucial point will only serve to furnish an erroneous impression of the subsurface depth , of the kind that has been schematically shown in fig .",
    "this fact categorically precludes the simple approach of determining the value of @xmath10 , using the arguments which have been presented following eq .",
    "( [ nmo ] ) , at the end of section  [ sec1 ] .",
    "the difficulties do not end here .",
    "in actual fact the situation is vastly more complicated .",
    "the dipping reflectors will have a varying gradient from one spatial position to another , as opposed to being at a constant incline with respect to the horizontal , shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] . besides this",
    ", there will be geological faults , and the propagation velocity of the seismic waves will also have a variation with respect to the depth .",
    "all of these facts will combine to render the accurate imaging of the subsurface a quite formidable task .",
    "nevertheless , all reflection seismic records must be corrected for non - vertical reflections .",
    "this evidently complicated process of correction is what is , for all practical purposes , implied by the term _ migration_. it purports to shift all dipping reflections to their true subsurface positions  @xcite .",
    "another important point has to be stressed here .",
    "so far the entire discussion has accounted for dip and subsurface variations in the _ inline _ direction  @xcite , i.e. the direction along which the source - receiver arrays have been lined up .",
    "this means that the analytical treatment presented so far has been confined to a @xmath34 plane only  along the vertical depth ( given by the @xmath35 coordinate ) and along the offset direction ( given by the @xmath0 coordinate ) .",
    "however , practically speaking , variations in the subsurface will also take place in the _ crossline _ direction  @xcite , i.e. along the @xmath36 axis .",
    "so a comprehensive migration process must account for all variations along all the three spatial coordinates , i.e. it should in effect be a complete @xmath37 process accounting for any change in the gradient of any subsurface reflector .",
    "by now the case for a complete @xmath37 migration process has been fully argued for .",
    "to carry out @xmath37 migration effectively , a necessary exercise would be to study the propagation of a compressional wavefield , @xmath38 .",
    "this is described mathematically by the wave equation @xmath39 with @xmath40 being the standard laplacian operator  @xcite , and with @xmath6 having a general dependence on all the three spatial coordinates .",
    "expressed in terms of its individual components , this second - order partial differential equation in both the space and the time coordinates will read as @xmath41    on the surface of the earth the upcoming seismic wavefield would be measured as @xmath42 . for fixed values of @xmath0 and @xmath36 , the signal would be a function of @xmath1 only , giving a single trace .",
    "extended over the whole @xmath0@xmath36 plane , this will build a proper mathematical understanding of the entire @xmath37 volume of seismic traces that one is required to work with .",
    "given this _",
    "condition on the surface of the earth , one would have to find the wavefield , @xmath43 , which is actually the reflectivity of the earth in its recesses ( and effectively , it also defines an _ initial _ condition at @xmath44 ) .",
    "this whole process will require , as an intermediate step , the projecting of the surface wavefield to a depth @xmath35 , corresponding to @xmath44 .",
    "_ in mathematical terms , this is the most general understanding that one can have about migration _  @xcite .    solving eq .",
    "( [ wave ] ) is no easy feat , because of its dependence on four independent variables .",
    "however , under the simple working assumption that @xmath6 is a constant , it is possible to go a long way , by adopting the method of fourier transforms  @xcite . by definition ,",
    "the fourier transform of the wavefield @xmath45 over the coordinates @xmath0 , @xmath36 and @xmath1 is given as  @xcite @xmath46 in terms of this transformed wavefield , eq .",
    "( [ wave ] ) can be recast as a second - order ordinary differential equation , which is @xmath47 with @xmath48 now being understood to be @xmath49 .",
    "it is worth stressing the importance of the method that has led to eq .",
    "( [ orddiff ] ) .",
    "the starting point was eq .",
    "( [ laplace ] )  a second - order partial differential equation in four variables .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath0 , @xmath36 and @xmath1 , into their corresponding reciprocal domains of @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , has rendered this partial differential equation into a relatively simple second - order ordinary differential equation .",
    "for mathematical ease , this is the most important purpose that a fourier transform can serve . of course , working in the fourier domain has other practical advantages , especially from the perspective of the processing geophysicist , like the elimination of spikes and noise from the data  @xcite .    following the fourier transform",
    ", it will now be necessary to solve eq .",
    "( [ orddiff ] ) to extrapolate the wavefield from its value on the surface of the earth ( at @xmath53 ) to the required depth ( where @xmath54 ) .",
    "working under the simplifying assumption that @xmath6 is constant  @xcite , it becomes quite easy to solve eq .",
    "( [ orddiff ] ) , which will actually have the form of the simple harmonic oscillator  @xcite . with the imposition of the definition",
    "@xcite @xmath55 ( a _ dispersion relation _ as it were ) is transformed according to the rule , @xmath56  @xcite . ] ) , one can proceed to derive an integral solution of eq .",
    "( [ orddiff ] ) as @xmath57 actually , the most general form of eq .",
    "( [ solinteg ] ) is given by the superposition of an upcoming wave and a downgoing wave .",
    "i.e. @xmath58 .",
    "however , only the solution with the negative sign need be retained here , since it corresponds physically to upcoming waves , which , for the present purpose , are actually the relevant modes  @xcite . this whole analysis shows how it should be possible to extrapolate the surface wavefield to a given depth below the surface of the earth .",
    "while it has been quite a simple task to arrive at this result under the assumption of constant velocity , one can also derive an asymptotic solution for the extrapolation exercise when the velocity is dependent on the depth , i.e. @xmath59 .",
    "this treatment has been presented in section  [ sec35 ] .",
    "one way or the other , the one primary fact that stands out is that so far as migration is concerned , the result given by eq .",
    "( [ solinteg ] ) , i.e. extrapolating the surface data to the depth , represents a crucial step . beyond this point",
    "there can be many variations in the subsequent execution of the migration process , depending on varying contingencies . in",
    "what follows later , the specific principles of some of these methods will be dwelt upon .",
    "it has already been seen how easily eq .  ( [ orddiff ] )",
    "can be integrated when @xmath6 is constant .",
    "supposing now that @xmath6 has a dependence on the @xmath35 coordinate , i.e. @xmath59 , it will still be possible to derive an asymptotic solution of eq .",
    "( [ orddiff ] ) , under appropriate conditions , with the help of the wkb ( _ wentzel - kramers - brillouin _ ) approximation  @xcite .    since @xmath6 has a dependence on @xmath35 ,",
    "so should @xmath60 have a dependence on @xmath35 , by virtue of eq .",
    "( [ kayzed ] ) .",
    "therefore , one can write @xmath61 for which a trial solution in the most general form can be set down as @xmath62 with @xmath63 being an amplitude function , and @xmath64 being a phase function . substituting this trial solution in eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) will give @xmath65   + i \\frac{{{\\mathrm}d } \\alpha}{{{\\mathrm}d } z } \\frac{{\\mathrm}d}{{{\\mathrm}d}z }   \\left [ \\ln \\left(\\frac{{{\\mathrm}d } \\alpha}{{{\\mathrm}d } z } a^2 \\right ) \\right ] = 0 .\\ ] ] the real and imaginary components above will have to be set to zero separately . in doing this , a solution for the imaginary part can be extracted , and it will read as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a constant of integration .",
    "the foregoing result indicates that knowing either @xmath63 or @xmath64 independently will suffice to give the full solution implied by eq .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "so far the mathematical treatment has been exact . in deriving a solution from the real component of eq .",
    "( [ a3 ] ) , it will be necessary now to apply the wkb approximation , requiring that the amplitude function @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) , is a much more slowly varying function of @xmath35 than the phase , @xmath69 . in that event",
    "one can neglect the second derivative of @xmath63 with respect to @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ a3 ] ) .",
    "this will give the phase solution @xmath70 ( taking the more practically relevant negative solution , as usual ) which , used along with eq .",
    "( [ a4 ] ) , will give an aysmptotic solution that will read as @xmath71 .\\ ] ]    how can the use of the wkb approximation be justified self - consistently ?",
    "on using the solutions given by eqs .",
    "( [ a4 ] ) and  ( [ a5 ] ) , it can be seen that the second derivative of @xmath63 is given as @xmath72 \\times \\left [ \\frac{{\\mathrm}d}{{{\\mathrm}d}z } \\left(\\ln v \\right ) \\right]^2 -   \\frac{{\\mathrm}d^2}{{{\\mathrm}d}z^2 } \\left(\\ln v \\right ) \\bigg\\ } .\\ ] ] on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ a7 ] ) one can see derivatives of the logarithm of @xmath6 .",
    "now it is known that the logarithm of any function varies much more slowly than that function itself .",
    "the same should hold for @xmath73 in comparison with @xmath6 itself .",
    "therefore , it becomes eminently possible to argue that with the second derivative of @xmath63 depending on the derivatives of @xmath73 , the requirement of @xmath63 being a slowly varying function of @xmath35 is satisfactorily fulfilled , and one may safely neglect the term containing the second derivative of @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ a3 ] ) . indeed",
    ", this will be all the more appropriate for greater depths , where , with @xmath6 being an increasing function of @xmath35 , the logarithmic terms will strongly temper the variation of @xmath63 arising due to the velocity variations .",
    "so the asymptotic solution given by eq .",
    "( [ a6 ] ) will have a firmer validity at greater depths .",
    "this entire line of reasoning upholds the invoking of the wkb approximation .",
    "it has been discussed in section  [ sec3 ] that the very definition of migration necessitates projecting seismic data from the _ boundary _ condition @xmath53 for all @xmath1 , to the _ initial _",
    "condition @xmath44 for all @xmath35 . to this end , it shall be expedient to set down first the inverse fourier transform corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ fou ] ) .",
    "this will be @xmath74 it is also known by now how it should be possible to relate @xmath75 to the surface seismic data with the help of eq .",
    "( [ solinteg ] ) . using this condition in eq .",
    "( [ invfou ] ) and setting @xmath44 , will give @xmath76 which is the equation for the phase - shift method , suited for @xmath37 migration  @xcite .",
    "the involvement of @xmath52 can be eliminated from this equation , by making use of eq .",
    "( [ kayzed ] ) , under the constraint that @xmath6 is constant , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are to be kept unchanged  @xcite .",
    "this will first deliver the relation @xmath77 leading ultimately to @xmath78 @xmath79 which is the equation for constant velocity @xmath37 stolt migration  @xcite .    the derivation of the result in eq .",
    "( [ stolt ] ) is certainly consistent with what has been forwarded as a mathematical definition of migration in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "however , short of resorting to an involved numerical treatment , the full @xmath37 problem does not lend itself very easily to deriving any pedagogical insight out of it .",
    "hence it should be instructive to consider a very special case of this migration method , for a wavefield that has a spatial dependence on the @xmath35 coordinate only , and so will actually be a vertically propagating planar wavefield .",
    "for such a wavefield , with no dependence on the @xmath0 and @xmath36 coordinates , and propagating in a planar front along the @xmath35 axis only , one can set down the wavefield as @xmath80 . in terms of the fourier",

    "( [ solinteg ] ) will give an extrapolation relation going as @xmath82 for the special case that is being studied here .",
    "from eq .",
    "( [ kayzed ] ) one also gets @xmath83 , since there is no involvement of the @xmath0 and @xmath36 coordinates .",
    "use of all these conditions in eq .",

    "their mathematical connection is given by @xmath86 which can then be compared with the result given in eq .",
    "( [ b4 ] ) .",
    "this will immediately allow for setting down @xmath87 which is a result that very unambiguously connects the depth of a reflecting stratum with the time of the reception of a signal reflected from that stratum ( under the simple condition that the velocity of the wave propagation is unchanging ) .",
    "an important point to note here is that the simple appearance of eq .",
    "( [ b6 ] ) has been possible because the plane wave allows only the vertically propagating mode in eq .",
    "( [ kayzed ] ) , and so by default this mode has been decoupled from all the other modes .",
    "this decoupling should be impossible to achieve for higher spatial dimensions , as a look at eq .",
    "( [ kayzed ] ) ought to reveal .",
    "it shall be useful at this point to derive the traveltime equation for the @xmath37 zero - offset case , using the method of the stationary phase approximation . from eq .",
    "( [ invfou ] ) one can , making use of the extrapolation condition given by eq .",
    "( [ solinteg ] ) , write a compact relation that will read as @xmath88 in which @xmath89    it is easy to see that the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ statio ] ) has an amplitude part and a phase part .",
    "if the phase is to vary much more rapidly than the amplitude ( a requirement that is consistent with the wkb analysis presented in section  [ sec35 ] ) , then the consequent rapid oscillations over most of the range of the integration , will result in an average value of nearly zero .",
    "the exception to this principle will occur when @xmath90 is stationary  @xcite . this ( the stationary phase approximation ) will be quantified by @xmath91 , which is , in fact , a condition for the turning points of @xmath90 .",
    "the major contribution to the integral will , therefore , come from the turning points of the phase function @xmath90 .",
    "this condition will help in identifying the physical coordinates from where one will obtain the most significant contribution to the signal received on the surface of the earth .",
    "going by eq .",
    "( [ kayzed ] ) , it is already known that @xmath60 has a dependence on @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "taking this in conjunction with eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) , and noting that the relevant variables for the integration in eq .",
    "( [ statio ] ) are @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the required extremum condition for @xmath90 can consequently be stated as @xmath92 the result above can only mean that all the three partial derivatives in eq .",
    "( [ phivar ] ) are to be individually set to zero .",
    "this will give three distinct mathematical conditions , from which one will be able to derive the traveltime equation for the @xmath37 zero - offset case as @xmath93 this defines a sphere of radius @xmath94 in the @xmath0@xmath36@xmath35 coordinate space , and a hyperboloid in the @xmath0@xmath36@xmath1 space for a constant value of @xmath35 .",
    "considering only the inline direction and the depth ( i.e. when @xmath95 ) , eq .",
    "( [ traveltime ] ) will define a semi - circle below the surface of the earth in the @xmath0@xmath35 plane , and the usual hyperbola in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane .",
    "however , a much more interesting result can be seen for the simplest possible case of the planar wavefront , i.e where the spatial dependence is only on the @xmath35 coordinate . in that case",
    "the result in eq .",
    "( [ traveltime ] ) will converge simply to the linear solution @xmath96 , which is exactly what eq .",
    "( [ b6 ] ) also furnishes .",
    "so effectively this simple special case establishes an intriguing mathematical equivalence between the stationary phase approximation method and the constant velocity stolt migration algorithm .",
    "migration strategies can be implemented over a wide range  from @xmath34 poststack time migration to @xmath37 prestack depth migration .",
    "the geological features of the subsurface will determine the choice of a particular algorithm , or even a combination of various algorithms .",
    "in practice , time migration enjoys wide popularity because it is least sensitive to errors in velocity , and delivers acceptable results to make a reliable interpretation . however , time migration is trustworthy only as long as the lateral velocity variations are at most moderate .",
    "otherwise depth migration is more appropriate .",
    "standard migration algorithms are based on the wave equation .",
    "one can classify migration processes under three broad categories  @xcite :    * those based on the integral solution of the wave equation . * those based on the finite - differencing of the partial differential equation implied by the wave equation . * those based on the implementation of the frequency - wavenumber algorithm .",
    "it is to be borne in mind that none of the migration algorithms that are implemented in the industry today gives a complete prescription for handling all dips and velocity variations , while being cost - effective at the same time .",
    "migration algorithms based on the integral solution of the wave equation ( kirchhoff migration ) can become cumbersome when they encounter lateral velocity variations .",
    "finite - difference algorithms can only be specified for different degrees of dip approximations .",
    "and frequency - wavenumber algorithms are effective against lateral velocity variations only to a limited extent .",
