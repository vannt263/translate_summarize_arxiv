    "during the last two decades one could observe a remarkable progress in laser technology . since the invention of the cpa technique @xcite in 1985 , the maximum laser intensity has been increased by seven orders of magnitude reaching nowadays the value @xmath6w/@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the announced new generation of @xmath3  pw laser facilities like eli beamlines , which is now under construction in prague , czech republic @xcite , or vulcan in uk @xcite , will provide intensity above @xmath4w/@xmath5 . therefore physics in the presence of such ultra - strong fields is now coming upon a focus of attention .",
    "one of the most striking effects in this area is electron - positron pair creation from vacuum @xcite .",
    "however , according to recent calculations @xcite , spontaneous pair creation from vacuum would require an optical laser of the power above @xmath7  pw , still far from the experimental possibilities of the nearest future .",
    "another important example of ultra - strong field physics phenomena are quantum electrodynamical ( qed ) cascades @xcite . in the present paper we consider cascades seeded by electrons , that are initially at rest at the focus of intense laser field .",
    "they are accelerated by laser field emitting hard photons , which in turn create further electron - positron pairs .",
    "the created electrons and positrons are again accelerated by the field thus emitting hard photons , which again create new pairs and so on .",
    "such an avalanche - like process finishes by escape of the particles from the focal region .",
    "observation of qed cascade production in a laboratory is important for both fundamental physics and testing the qed principles .",
    "however , numerical simulations performed in the previous works @xcite for some particular models of laser pulses have indicated that the threshold intensity required for cascade development would be of the order or above @xmath8w/@xmath5 . in the latter case",
    "this may still exceed the capabilities of such facilities as e.g. the eli beamlines .",
    "our goal is to optimize the experimental setup , in particular the field distribution at the focus , thus suggesting configuration that decreases the threshold intensity required for qed cascade production .",
    "consider the qed field strength parameter @xmath0 @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the electron mass and charge , @xmath12 is the particle energy and @xmath13 is the component of the lorentz force per unit charge @xmath14 $ ] transverse with respect to the particle velocity @xmath15 . in the framework of a locally constant field approximation @xcite",
    "the parameter ( [ chi ] ) evolves in between the hard photon emission and pair creation events according to the classical equations of motion and its instant value defines the probabilities of these processes @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the probabilities of pair creation and hard photon emission , respectively , @xmath19 is the energy of radiating electron or pair creating photon and @xmath20 is the fine structure constant .",
    "since @xmath21 is less than @xmath22 of a radiating electron and pair creation is exponentially suppressed at @xmath23 , we have to find such a field configuration that provides the most rapid growth of @xmath0 .",
    "back to @xmath0 . ] then we calculate numerically the threshold intensity for qed cascade development in such an optimal field configuration .",
    "assume that a seeding particle is placed initially at rest at the focus of the laser field . in order to optimize field configuration for cascade production ,",
    "we derive first a formula for the time dependence @xmath24 near the focus , i.e. in a time range @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the field carrier frequency . in this case",
    "the electric and magnetic fields can be expanded into taylor series @xmath25 with respect to time and coordinates @xmath26 . since a standing wave composed of two identical counterpropagating laser beams produces cascades more efficiently than a single beam of the same total power @xcite , we assume in advance that the electric field at the center of the focal region reaches maximum and the magnetic field vanishes .",
    "besides , in what follows we assume that the laser field is so strong that particles become ultrarelativistic soon after start of acceleration , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the acceleration time , but still remains much weaker than the qed critical field , @xmath29v / cm .",
    "let us find the particle momentum satisfying the equation of motion @xmath30 in the form @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",
    "for @xmath33 onwards .",
    "] the solution of equations of motion , accurate to the zeroth order in @xmath34 , reads @xmath35    using expressions for the fields within the first order in @xmath34 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 we can solve the first order equation of motion @xmath39 , where @xmath40,\\ ] ] and obtain for the particle velocity @xmath41 , @xmath42    since the magnitude of the transverse component of the lorenz force is equal to @xmath43|=ef_\\bot^{(1 ) } t/2 $ ] , where @xmath44 is the component of ( [ f ] ) transverse to the initial electric field @xmath45 , we arrive at the formula @xmath46 the result ( [ chipar ] ) is in agreement with special cases of rotating purely electric field and a standing plane wave obtained previously in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "hence , in order to optimize field configuration for cascade production we must increase the coefficient at @xmath47 in the formula ( [ chipar ] ) as much as possible .",
    "( color online ) . allocation of @xmath48 tightly focused beams colliding in a plane . ]    a method for reducing the total threshold power for spontaneous pair creation from vacuum via multibeam technology was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was clearly demonstrated how the key parameter of that problem , the electric field strength in the focus , can be increased considerably by splitting a laser beam into several pairs of linearly polarized colliding beams of the same total power . however , in our case of cascade production linear polarization is expected to be unfavorable @xcite . therefore we modify that scheme not restricting polarization of individual beams a priory .",
    "let us consider an even number @xmath49 of focused beams propagating in @xmath50 plane at angles @xmath51 with the @xmath52 axis ( see fig .  [ 8beams ] ) and optimize their polarization for cascade production . for",
    "not too strong focused beams their field near the focus can be well approximated by plane waves @xmath53 here @xmath54 , @xmath55 are the individual polarization vectors , which we do not require in advance to be normalized , and @xmath56 are the unit vectors directed along the focal axis of the beams . in case",
    "all the beams are focused weakly , the power of each of the beams can be estimated as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a geometric factor depending on the beam shape , @xmath59 is the focal cross section area of the beam .",
    "the same kind of formula remains true for a tight focusing case as well , but the geometric factor in such a case is modified ( see below ) .",
    "below , we prefer to fix the total power @xmath60 of the beams , in terms of which @xmath61.\\ ] ]    due to transversality of the plane waves ( [ aplane ] ) , all the terms containing space derivatives in ( [ deb ] ) vanish within this approximation , so that @xmath62 . substituting @xmath63 into ( [ chipar ] ) and taking into account ( [ a0 ] ) , for @xmath64 colliding beams",
    "we obtain @xmath65 where the factor @xmath66},\\quad \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{1,2}=\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^n\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^j_{1,2}\\ ] ] totally determines dependence of @xmath0 on the number of beams and their polarization .",
    "evidently , in order to maximize the expression ( [ f ] ) all the vectors @xmath67 should be parallel each other .",
    "since the @xmath50-plane had been chosen as the plane of beam propagation , we assume thus that @xmath67 are all directed along the @xmath68-axis , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the corresponding versor . also , since the electric field in the beam is transverse to the wave propagation direction @xmath71 , or just @xmath72 , for all @xmath73 . ]",
    ", we can assume that @xmath74 .",
    "due to the symmetry of the problem the polarization vector of the total electric field can lie in any plane parallel to @xmath68-axis .",
    "let it be the @xmath75- plane .",
    "then @xmath76 where , to clarify further manipulations , in the last representation we have introduced four formal @xmath64-vectors @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , the latter with all @xmath64 components equal to @xmath81 .",
    "now it follows from the chain of inequalities @xmath82 that @xmath83 reaches its maximum value when @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 . for @xmath87 these conditions",
    "are equivalent to @xmath88 in particular , @xmath89 i.e. the optimal polarization of the total field is elliptical with the semi - major to semi - minor axis ratio equal to @xmath90 .",
    "the polarization vectors of the individual beams in such an optimal case are @xmath91 in case @xmath92 the factor @xmath93 does not appear in denominator of eq .",

    "in fact , qed cascades do not possess a natural sharp threshold , so that we define it formally as creation of just a single pair on average by each seed electron during passage of laser pulses through the focus . as a more realistic model we use a model of the focused laser beam suggested in refs .",

    "( [ aplane ] ) ; @xmath111 is the total power of all colliding beams .",
    "it follows from ( [ chin ] ) that for given total power , the geometric factor @xmath112 ( i.e. , focusing ) should be maximized .",
    "note that in modern laser facilities the beam can be focused so tightly , that a half of the beam power is passing through a circle of the wavelength diameter in the focal plane @xcite .",

    "@xmath118 and @xmath119 are the polar coordinates in the plane @xmath120 .",
    "it is also worth taking into account that there exist bounds for a number of beams that can be allocated concurrently in a plane without overlapping @xcite . at far distance from the focal region the field of each of the beams",
    "is almost confined to a cone with aperture @xmath121 , which is simply related to our focusing parameter @xmath122 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath123 the energy of the field is proportional to @xmath124 .",
    "therefore we can estimate the aperture by @xmath125 . for @xmath96 , @xmath126 ,",
    "hence the number of beams that can be allocated without overlapping in the @xmath50-plane must be less than @xmath3 .",
    "hence , for @xmath96 the maximal even number of beams is @xmath127 as in fig .",
    "[ 8beams ] .    for numerical simulations",
    "we have used two independent codes .",
    "the first one @xcite is a realization of monte - carlo ( mc ) algorythm , in which we assume that electrons and positrons are moving classically between the emission events , which are implemented by the corresponding event generators similar to refs .",
    "the second one is a more general 3d particle - in - cell - monte - carlo ( pic - mc ) code for simulation of laser - plasma interactions with quantum radiation effects @xcite .",
    "actually , in our problem the electron - positron plasma remains dilute and the results obtained with both codes are in good agreement . in this paper",
    "we present the results obtained with the first ( pure mc ) code .",
    "since our field model ( [ afed ] ) corresponds to a field unbounded in time , we take into account finiteness of pulse duration artificially by limiting the simulation time . the simulation time was chosen to be @xmath128 laser periods @xmath100 as is typical for modern laser facilities @xcite . in simulations ,",
    "the seed particles were represented by a bunch of @xmath129 electrons placed initially at rest near the center @xmath130 of the focus .",
    "the laser carrier wavelength was taken to be @xmath131 m , which corresponded to laser photon energy @xmath81ev and the focusing parameter was chosen as @xmath96 for the reasons discussed above .",
    "the resulting power and intensity thresholds obtained by numerical simulation of qed cascade development in the cases of @xmath92 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath127 beams with optimal polarization ( [ optpol ] ) , colliding in a plane are presented in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "one can observe that both the laser power and intensity required for cascade production decrease significantly due to a multibeam setup .",
    "cascade dynamics for the cases of optimal elliptic polarization and circular polarization of the total field for the case of @xmath48 beams is displayed on fig .",
    "the figure clearly demonstrates the advantage of the suggested optimal polarization .    besides , it is clear from fig .",
    "[ nt ] that in the case of optimal polarization cascade development is splitted into two stages , which differ by the slope of the curve . at the first stage",
    "the seeding particles are accelerated by the field , create pairs and escape the focal region .",
    "almost all created particles also leave the focal region with a speed close to the speed of light , see fig .",
    "[ positrons ] .",
    "still , a small fraction of slow particles remains in the focal region being accelerated by the field . at time",
    "@xmath134 the mean value of the parameter @xmath0 for particles at the focus becomes large enough to initiate the second stage of cascade development , see fig .",
    "we have demonstrated that qed cascades can arise in laser - target interaction for laser power below @xmath3  pw and intensity below @xmath8w/@xmath5 .",
    "this is realizable with a multibeam setup , i.e. splitting of the original laser pulses into several pairs of colliding beam . in order to determine how to arrange the beams ,",
    "we have derived an analytical formula for growth of the parameter @xmath24 , which determines possibility of qed cascade generation .",
    "this allowed us to identify the optimal beam polarization with the most rapid growth of @xmath24 at the focus .",
    "for such an optimal configuration of @xmath64 beams and fixed total laser power , @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath64 .",
    "however , for our extreme choice of the focusing parameter , which corresponds to the state - of - the - art experimental capabilities , the maximal number of beams that can be brought together in a planar configuration of fig .",
    "[ 8beams ] is @xmath48 .",
    "thus we have next computed the qed cascade thresholds for the particular case of @xmath48 optimally polarized beams . according to our simulations , in this case the threshold total power @xmath135  pw and the threshold intensity @xmath136w/@xmath5 .",
