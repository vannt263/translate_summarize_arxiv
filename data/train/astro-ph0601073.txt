    "with the establishment of observational evidence favoring dark energy domination in the recent history of the cosmological expansion , numerous different models were suggested to account for it . for most of them",
    "the value of the corresponding density parameter is chosen to fit the observational one .",
    "in contrast , gurzadyan and xue formula @xcite for dark energy predicts the observed value for the density parameter of the dark energy .",
    "the formula reads @xcite @xmath1where @xmath2 is the planck constant , the planck length is @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the speed of light , @xmath5 is the gravitational constant , @xmath6 is the scale factor of the universe . following the original idea by zeldovich @xcite",
    ", it corresponds to the cosmological term @xmath7therefore , to keep it constant , the speed of light should vary with cosmological expansion as @xmath8 .",
    "one can consider other possibilities as well , assuming the presence of some fundamental physical quantity and admitting variation of basic physical constants @xcite in the spirit of dirac approach . since the planck constant does not appear in ( rholambda ) , these can be the gravitational constant and the speed of light .    in the literature",
    "there is a long - standing discussion how to understand possible variability of physical constants , linking this point to the meaning of world constants and units in physics @xcite .",
    "clearly experimentally only dimensionless constants variation can be detected , but the meaning and the content of the underlying physical theory changes depending on the issue which dimensionful quantity varies .",
    "in fact , models with varying physical constants are among the currently discussed ones ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , models based on the formula ( rholambda ) are very different from various phenomenological models of dark energy , phantoms etc . , because of the underlying _ empirical basis _ , namely agreement between predictions for dark energy density parameter and the value , following from the array of recent observations .",
    "the classification of various cosmological models following from gx - formula is given in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is shown @xcite that gx models provide indeed good fit to supernovae and radio galaxies data .",
    "these models contain hidden invariance , the separatrix dividing cosmological solutions into two classes : singular friedmannian - type and non - singular with vanishing initial density @xcite,@xcite . in this paper",
    "we provide cosmological equations for the simplest cases discussed in ver05 and generalize them , including radiation field , and compare them to the standard cosmological model .    in the section 2 cosmological framework with varying physical constants",
    "is formulated . in the section 3",
    "we derive cosmological equations for particular cases , discussed in @xcite .",
    "we provide analytical solutions for energy density in all models , and also in some models for the scale factor .",
    "conclusions follow in the last section .",
    "in this section we are going to derive cosmological equations , assuming varying constants , such as the speed of light @xmath9 , the gravitational constant @xmath10 and the cosmological term @xmath11 depending on the cosmic time @xmath12 .",
    "einstein equations are postulated to be valid in such a case .",
    "we start from the frw interval @xmath13 ,   \\label{int}\\]]where @xmath14 are spatial coordinates , @xmath15 is the scale factor . using einstein equations",
    "@xmath16and the energy - momentum tensor @xmath17with @xmath18 being the energy density , @xmath19 being the pressure , we arrive at the cosmological equations @xmath20@xmath21where @xmath22 is the sign of spatial curvature , @xmath23 is the hubble parameter , a dot denotes time derivative . from ( [ fe1 ] ) and ( fe2 ) ( or from @xmath24 ) continuity equation",
    "can be written @xmath25    where have we introduced @xmath26 .",
    "the same equations were derived e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the difference with @xcite is that we consider the scaling ( [ rholambda ] ) not as a phenomenological , but as an empirical relation .",
    "it is easy to check that ( [ fe1 ] ) is the first integral of ( [ fe2 ] ) as it is within standard friedmann cosmology .",
    "cosmological equations for the case when @xmath4 and @xmath5 both depend on time can be found in @xcite .",
    "for the case when instead @xmath27 and @xmath5 depend on time these equations are given in @xcite .",
    "our equations reduce to equations of @xcite and @xcite with the corresponding assumptions .",
    "there is a little difference with @xcite , because we postulated only invariance of the einstein equations , while authors of @xcite assumed that both einstein and friedmann equations are still valid . with these assumptions the last term in ( [ fe2 ] ) disappears and our equations looks identical to those of @xcite .",
    "note , that the former energy conservation does not hold any more : there are sources and drains of energy ( e.g. from dark energy to the usual matter , from the variation of the speed of light and the gravitational field strength ) in ( [ mue ] ) . as we will see in the next section , ( [ mue ] ) can be integrated to obtain energy density as explicit function of the scale factor .",
    "further for some models friedmann equation ( [ fe1 ] ) can be explicitly integrated to get the scale factor as a function of time .    in @xcite five different cases",
    "have been discussed , namely :    1 .",
    "c = const , g = const , @xmath28const ; 2 .",
    "@xmath8 , g = const , @xmath29const ; 3 .",
    "c = const , @xmath30 , @xmath31@xmath32const , @xmath28const ( case 3.1 ) ; 4 .",
    "@xmath33 , g = const , @xmath31@xmath34const , @xmath28const ( case 4.2 ) ; 5 .",
    "@xmath35const , @xmath36const , @xmath37const .    in what follows",
    "we analyze each of the first four cases , provide cosmological equations and corresponding solutions for them .",
    "in this section we present cosmological equations for each of the cases ( i - iv ) and discuss the corresponding cosmological scenarios , providing analytical solutions , where possible .      in this subsection",
    "we put the pressure in ( [ fe2 ] ) and ( [ mue ] ) to zero and introduce mass density @xmath38 .",
    "each solution can be parametrized by the usual matter density    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the critical density in usual friedmannian models , subscript 0 denotes the value of each quantity today . in",
    "what follows , to define density parameters we use normalization condition    @xmath41    where @xmath42 numbers components such as dark energy , radiation , usual matter .    in order to get density as a function of the scale factor we rewrite ( mue ) as    @xmath43",
    "the crucial feature of these models is the presence of a separatrix in solutions for the density as a function of the scale factor  ( see vy06b and @xcite ) .",
    "this separatrix divides solutions in two classes : the one with friedmannian singularity , and the one with vanishing density and non - zero scale factor in the beginning .    to see the difference from our models and the corresponding friedmannian ones we compute for each case",
    "_ mass transfer rate _ , namely the ratio between r of ( [ cont ] ) and expansion term @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45    if dimensionless @xmath46 vanishes , it means the usual friedmannian solution @xmath47 holds .",
    "when @xmath48 mass transfer cancels the effect of expansion and the mass density does not change in course of expansion .",
    "if it is large , effect of expansion can be neglected .    * model 1 ( varying cosmological constant ) . * neither the speed of light nor the gravitational constant vary with time , but in this case from ( [ lambda ] ) we find @xmath49 .",
    "cosmological equations are    @xmath50 @xmath51where @xmath52 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath53 , i.e. the effect of @xmath27 variation is to make spatial geometry negatively curved , even if the original sign of @xmath22 is @xmath54 . the source term in the continuity equation can be interpreted as the energy transfer from the dark energy component into the matter component ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "solution for the density is given by    @xmath55    and after substitution of this solution to ( [ fe1 ] ) we obtain    @xmath56    where @xmath57this solution reduces to a simple form for separatrix value with the condition @xmath58 , namely@xmath59    the separatrix solution is given by the density parameter @xmath60 and depends slightly on the spatial curvature . for high values of the density parameter solutions practically coincide with the corresponding friedmannian ones .",
    "in such a case one can neglect the source term in the continuity equation .",
    "this also can be done for large scale factors since solutions approach the separatrix where they describe friedmann universe with negative curvature .",
    "the present scale factor is well defined quantity even for @xmath61 models , @xmath62 since this is the model with effective negative curvature with @xmath63 . with this definition ( [ norm ] ) is satisfied along with with ( [ muc ] ) .    mass transfer rate ( [ mtr ] ) for this model in terms of density parameter",
    "is given by @xmath64 and it is clear that @xmath46 gets infinite with @xmath65 , i.e. vacuum mass transfer dominates expansion , and in the opposite case the model approaches friedmannian matter dominated one with negative curvature .    * model 2 ( varying speed of light ) . * to keep interpretation of @xmath27 as a cosmological constant , we have to require the varying speed of light , @xmath66 . at the same time the gravitational constant does not change , @xmath5=const .",
    "cosmological equations reduce to the following system    @xmath67@xmath68where @xmath69 .",
    "the source in the continuity equation now comes from the speed of light variability .",
    "there is complete analytical solution for this model @xmath70@xmath71where    @xmath72    in this model the separatrix is given by @xmath73 independent on the curvature .",
    "if one neglects the source in the continuity equation ( that is again possible for large @xmath6 or large @xmath74 ) , which consists of two terms , proportional to @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively , we come to the usual friedmann - lematre cosmology with the cosmological constant @xmath77 .",
    "the density parameter for @xmath78 term is @xmath79 and the scale factor today is arbitrary quantity in this model",
    ".    mass transfer rate ( [ mtr ] ) is simply @xmath80 so it precisely cancels expansion with @xmath81 .",
    "* model 3 ( varying gravitational constant ) . *",
    "we introduce the fundamental constant @xmath82=const , the density of the vacuum . in this case the gravitational constant changes , @xmath83 , while the speed of light does not .",
    "the cosmological term also acquires dependence on the scale factor through @xmath5 and is given by ( lambda ) .",
    "cosmological equations are    @xmath84    @xmath85    these are very different from the usual friedmann equations .",
    "even if could neglect the source terms in the continuity equation ( that obviously can not be done ) , the first cosmological equation does not correspond to the first friedmann one .",
    "however , phase portrait of solutions for this model on the plane @xmath86 looks similar to the one of model 2 @xcite .",
    "again there is solution for density @xmath87notice similarity with ( [ musol2 ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath27 is a constant in the model 2 , while @xmath88 is constant in the model 3 , so the dependence of matter density on the scale factor is the same , although the dependence of dark energy on the scale factor is different .",
    "solution for the scale factor looks instead exactly the same as the solution for model 1 , ( [ sol1 ] ) with @xmath89    the separatrix is the same as in model 1 , given by @xmath90 .",
    "matter density parameter for this model is @xmath91 that is the same as ( [ muc ] ) .",
    "the scale factor today is the same as in model 1 and is given by ( [ a01 ] ) , as this expression follows from the definition of density parameter for curvature , which is the same as in model 1 .",
    "another , equivalent expression follows from definitions of vacuum mass density and critical density and it gives @xmath92    mass transfer rate ( [ mtr ] ) for this model is @xmath93 that is analogous to the model 2 , but with @xmath81 it corresponds to a constant fraction of expansion rate .",
    "* model 4 ( varying speed of light , constant vacuum energy density ) . * the constant vacuum energy density is introduced as @xmath94=const , requiring variation of the speed of light @xmath95 . here",
    "@xmath5=const and @xmath96 , where the constant @xmath97 appears in the cosmological equations    @xmath98    @xmath99with @xmath100 .",
    "the source term in the continuity equation can be neglected for large @xmath6 , but the first friedmann equation contains the positive @xmath101 term which is again very different from the standard cosmology .",
    "there is complete solution for this model with @xmath102and @xmath103where @xmath104    this solution reduces to ( [ ballistic ] ) for @xmath105 or , in other words , when @xmath106 .",
    "the separatrix is given by @xmath73 , like in model 2 .",
    "here new density parameter for dark energy is defined as @xmath107 and the scale factor value today follows from this definition @xmath108 notice that it is different from the scale factor in models 1 and 3 by the factor @xmath109",
    ".    mass transfer rate ( [ mtr ] ) for this model is given by @xmath110 from which we find that with @xmath65 the vaccum again dominates expansion , while in the opposite case this is just a constant fraction of expansion rate .",
    "therefore , it can not be reduced to the usual friedmannian model .",
    "finally , in the case 5 of @xcite cosmological equations are given by the system ( [ fe1])-([mue ] ) .",
    "definitions ( [ muc ] ) and ( [ norm ] ) can be used in this general case as well .",
    "so far we considered cosmological models based in gx formula ( [ rholambda ] ) , containing only dust and dark energy . in this subsection",
    "we turn to a more general class of models , including into consideration radiation .",
    "it is known ( e.g. @xcite ) that there is ambiguity in definition of multicomponent models with dark energy and/or variation of constants . there",
    "exist strong bounds on coupling between dark energy and radiation oph04,@xcite , so we avoid this ambiguity assuming decoupled radiation , namely    @xmath111    where the subscript @xmath112 refers to radiation .",
    "in standard cosmology any relativistic particle in thermodynamic equilibrium can be described by these equations . however",
    ", varying speed of light implies variation of dispersion relation @xmath113 , where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are particle s energy and momentum and @xmath116 is its rest mass , hence influences equation of state for ultrarelativistic fluid . in this paper",
    "we constrain ourselves with the case of thermal photons only .",
    "radiation density parameter in what follows is defined by @xmath117    then total energy conservation ( [ mue ] ) implies    @xmath118 \\left ( 4\\frac{dc}{cda}-\\frac{dg}{% gda}\\right ) -2\\mu \\frac{dc}{cda}. }      \\label{mue2 }      \\end{array}\\ ] ]    it is clear from ( [ mue2 ] ) that in general matter couples to radiation always except for the case @xmath119=const .    in this section",
    "we provide solutions for the set of cosmological models described by ( [ fe1]),([fe2]),([eqstate ] ) and ( [ mue2 ] ) . generally speaking",
    ", these models do not reduce to the ones considered above because of special role of radiation , given by ( [ eqstate ] ) .",
    "* model 1 , with radiation .",
    "* this is the unique case when the radiation does not couple to matter density , because neither speed of light , nor the gravitational constant vary .",
    "cosmological equations for this model read    @xmath120    @xmath51    solution for the matter density is the same ( [ mumod1 ] ) as it is in the absence of radiation .    additional peculiarity of this case",
    "is the presence of separatrix , playing the same role as for models without radiation .",
    "the separatrix is defined by    @xmath121    that again gives @xmath122 for any curvature parameter .",

    "solution for density is represented at fig .",

    "radiation density parameter is as usual ( [ rhor ] ) .",
    "curvature density parameters remains the same as in model without radiation , and the scale factor becomes a little bigger due to the change @xmath130 in ( [ a01 ] ) .    *",
    "model 2 , with radiation . *",
    "since the speed of light varies in this model , matter becomes coupled to radiation and solution gets complicated .",

    ".     equals to 0.3 ( firm curve ) , 0.667 ( thick curve ) and 0.999 ( dotted curve ) . ]",
    "although there is no separatrix with respect to initial singularity , the value @xmath73 again plays important role , dividing solutions in two classes , depending on the sign of time derivative of the density : for @xmath134 the density decreases with time in matter dominated epoch , like in friedmannian models , while for @xmath135 the density increases with time .",
    "this behavior is seen from equation for the density , since the condition @xmath136 leads to @xmath73 .",
    "in contrast to simple gx model without radiation , the scale factor is no more arbitrary in this model and is given by ( [ a01 ] ) with the change @xmath130 .",
    "radiation density parameter is @xmath137 and it coincides with ( [ rhor ] ) .",

    "( [ mod2 ] ) .",
    "this is because again with negligible contribution of radiation the time derivative of the density is determined by the condition @xmath141 which leads to the same density parameter @xmath73 .",

    "there is no special value of density parameter in model 4 .",
    "solutions start with zero density and positive scale factor , then the density increases rapidly in radiation dominated stage , but entering into matter dominated stage it starts to decrease , so for each solution there is a maximum in the density ( see fig .",
    "( [ mod4 ] ) ) .    here",
    "the density parameter of radiation is defined by @xmath147 and it is again equivalent to ( [ rhor ] ) .",
    "in this paper we explored various cosmological models with gurzadyan - xue dark energy formula ( [ rholambda ] ) , assuming also variation of physical constants such as the speed of light and the gravitational constant .",
    "it is shown that unlike standard friedmann models , various interesting possibilities appear .",
    "in particular in the model 1 the continuity equation is reduced to the energy transfer from dark energy component into the usual matter .",
    "for some cases ( models 1 and 4 ) , the source term in the continuity equation can be neglected for sufficiently large scale factors ( or sufficiently large present density of matter ) , and the discussion of the dynamics in this asymptotic cases can be given in terms of the standard cosmology .",
    "solutions for the density in terms of the scale factor for all models with pressureless matter and dark energy contain separatrix which divides solutions in two classes .",
    "the first class is analogous to the standard friedmann solutions with singularity in the beginning of expansion .",
    "the second class , in contrast , does not contain singularity ; solutions start with vanishing density and non - zero scale factor .",
    "we also considered generalization of gx models , including radiation , assuming that dynamics of the latter is not influenced by the variation of constants and by dark energy .",
    "interestingly , for the model 1 we obtained the behavior qualitatively similar to models without radiation . for the rest of models",
    "separatrix in the sense discussed above is absent and all solutions belong to the second class , namely non - friedmannian solutions .",
    "the density in these solutions may be larger in the past , but if so , it has a maximum and all solutions start with vanishing density in radiation - dominated epoch .",
    "however for models 2 and 3 with radiation the same value of density parameter @xmath73 that parametrizes separatrix in simple gx models , corresponds to constant mass density of pressureless matter in matter dominated epoch . for larger density parameter",
    "the mass density decreases with expansion and for smaller density parameter it increases .",
    "in fact , not all gx models with non - friedmannian behavior ( @xmath148 ) pass age constraint and have deceleration parameter which fits the value followed from observations . at the same time model iv with @xmath149",
    "pass both constraints and represent a good candidate for dark energy model @xcite which in the limit of vanishing energy transfer from dark energy to the usual matter has @xmath101 term in friedmann equation . in the same way models i and iii fit these constraints for density parameter slightly smaller than the separatrix value .",
    "this circumstance once more points out on a special role of the separatrix in gx models .",
    "notice another interesting feature of gx models with radiation .",
    "it is well known that friedmannian models with zero curvature have arbitrary scale factor .",
    "the same holds also for simple gx models ( model 2 ) .",
    "however , this degeneracy breaks down in gx models with radiation , where the scale factor can always be computed in terms of present density parameters , and present values of ( varying ) physical constants .",
