    "massive stars of spectral - type o are typically soft and bright x - ray sources . their x - ray emission is usually attributed to shocks in the dense region of the winds that grow from the intrinsic instabilities of the line driving mechanism . in the presence of a relatively strong magnetic field , the structure of the wind",

    "most of the puzzling properties of hd  93250 could be explained as part of a binary scenario where the collision between the wind of the two stars produces both an x - ray excess @xcite and an nt radio emission component in the form of synchrotron radiation in the presence of a population of relativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "the latter point is especially important in the sense that it provides the opportunity to investigate particle acceleration processes in massive star environments , in addition to evolved objects such as supernova remnants or binaries containing a compact object . for the wind collision scenario to produce enough x - ray and synchrotron radio flux , the winds from both components need to be of similar strength , and the companion",

    "observations have been made in configuration a0-k0-g1 , providing projected baselines ranging approximately from 50  m to 120  m. we recorded spectrally dispersed fringes between @xmath7 m at a spectral resolving power ( @xmath8 ) of 40 .    at vlti",

    "the offered limiting magnitude of amber ( @xmath10  mag ) has been measured on late - type stars , for which @xmath11  mag typically corresponds to @xmath9  mag .",
    "the offered magnitude thus results from the combination of the low flux limit in the observation band with the poor performance of the guiding for stars faint in @xmath12 .",

    "hd  93250 in the @xmath12-band ( @xmath15  mag ) the telescope guiding performs very well .",
    "the fraction of flux injected into amber is optimal and the sensitivity of the observations is only limited by the intrinsic flux of the object in the observation band . as a consequence , hd  93250 ( @xmath16 ) could be observed with the 1.8 m auxiliary telescopes ( ats ) despite the fact it is significantly fainter than the offered limiting magnitude .",

    "this transfer function was divided and removed from the visibilities and closure - phases obtained for the scientific target .",
    "the dispersion between the consecutive points obtained for each observation of a calibration star is an estimate of the transfer function instability .",

    ". altogether , the binary nature of hd  93250 is conclusively revealed by these observations .",

    "thanks to the combinations of three baselines of different orientations and of the h and the k bands , the position angle of the binary is unambiguous . by chance , an additional `` locking point '' for the binary model is provided by the visibility minimum observed in baseline k0-a0 .",

    "we used the method described in @xcite to estimate the likelihood to observe a significant rv shift as a function of the orbital period given the sampling provided by the optical observations and using no constraint on the orbital inclination .",
    "the probability that hd  93250 would have displayed a rv shift larger than 5  kms@xmath3  is very close to 1.0 up to periods of @xmath41  d , then drops sharply for longer periods ( fig .",

    "three rotational broadenings are considered . ]      using the formalism of @xcite adapted to o+o binaries , we estimate the x - ray luminosity that would be produced by the collision of two o4  iii winds of equal strength to be of the order of @xmath46  ergs@xmath3 . there is enough uncertainty in the mass - loss rate associated with hd  93250 ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to accommodate the range of periods and separations discussed in the previous section .",
    "it is thus not possible to use the x - ray luminosity to further constrain the orbital properties . assuming that the wind - wind collision is adiabatic , as expected for wide binaries , the x - ray flux produced in the wind collision should scale with the separation @xmath47 as @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "given that @xcite reported a variation of the x - ray flux of the order of 40% , one would thus expect hd  93250 to have a minimum eccentricity of 0.2 .    in a scenario where the observed radio synchrotron radiation is produced by colliding winds ,",
    "the wind - wind interaction region should be located out of the bulk of the stellar wind material .",
    "otherwise , the non - thermal radio photons suffer from significant free - free absorption and can not escape the radio photosphere . adopting the mass loss rate and the terminal velocity given by @xcite ( respectively 5.62@xmath4910@xmath50m@xmath51yr@xmath3 and 3000 kms@xmath3 ) , and using equations of @xcite and @xcite , we estimate the radius of the @xmath52 photosphere using the same procedure as in the case of hd  168112 in @xcite .",
    "the two frequencies investigated by @xcite , i.e. 8.64 and 4.80ghz , yield respectively photosphere radii of 1.4 and 2.2a.u .",
    "as the two components of the system are very similar , the wind - wind interaction region is expected to be located close to mid - separation , i.e. about 1.7 - 1.8 a.u .  according to our results and assuming no significant inclination effect .",
    "interestingly , these values are in good agreement with the detection of hd  93250 at 8.64ghz , and its non - detection at 4.80ghz @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that these considerations are likely to be epoch - dependent .",
    "for instance , an increase of the stellar separation in an eccentric orbit could lead to the detection of the synchrotron radiation at 4.80ghz as well .",
    "this scenario can only be verified through a multi - frequency radio monitoring of hd  93250 on time scales covering a significant fraction of the orbital period .",
    "using the eso / vlti , we provided evidence that hd  93250 is an o+o binary system .",
    "the binary nature gives a natural explanation of many of the intriguing properties of the object .",
    "in particular , it can explain the x - ray over - luminosity and nt radio emission in the framework of a colliding wind scenario .",
    "the latter point lends further support to the so - called ` standard scenario ' where particle acceleration occurs in the wind - wind interaction of a massive binary system . because we see no change in the orientation of the system in our two vlti observations separated by three months",
    ", we conclude that hd  93250 has a likely orbital period of the order of one to several years . a significant eccentricity is also required to explain the variations observed in the x - ray flux .",
    "we further show that the non - detection of a rv signature based on eight high - resolution spectra covering a seven - year period of time does not require a particularly unfavorable orbital configuration ( extremely low inclination , long period and/or high eccentricity ) .",
    "it can also be explained by observational biases resulting from line - blending in nearly equal - mass systems .",
    "further spectroscopic and high - angular observations are require to characterize the orbit of the system , which is needed to quantitatively understand the x - ray and nt radio processes originating from the wind - wind collision .    together with , hd  93250 was one of the only two known o - type nt radio emitters for which the binary scenario was questioned .",
    "our results provide further evidence that binarity and nt radio emission go hand - in - hand .",
    "as was the case for hd  93250 , rv campaigns have so far failed to confirm the binary nature of hd  168112 .",
    "long base - line interferometry might thus provide a complementary diagnostic tool to test the multiplicity properties of hd  168112 in particular and of single non - thermal radio emitters in general .",
