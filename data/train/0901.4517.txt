    "under appropriate conditions , contraction waves traveling along the muscle fiber can be observed  @xcite .    theoretical work on this system has so far focused on synchronization effects of chains of coupled hopf - oscillators  @xcite . in that analysis , synchronization effects due a global coupling of oscillatory elements through a mass have been studied . in particular , a rich phase diagram of synchronous and asynchronous states was found . in another study , gradients in sarcomere properties where suggested to cause synchronization between adjacent sarcomeres which ultimately yields coherent contraction waves  @xcite .",

    "we will start therefore in the next section by developing a hydrodynamic theory of muscle fibers .",
    "as will be shown , this description fails to yield oscillatory solutions . in the subsequent section we will consider a microscopic model of muscle sarcomeres in which spontaneous oscillations are a consequence of load dependent detachment rates of motors from filaments .",
    "the corresponding model of a chain of sarcomeres is then shown to wholly reproduce the phenomenology of waves along muscle fibers . in the discussion , we compare the results of our theoretical analysis to experimental observations .",

    "formally , a hydrodynamic mode of wave - length @xmath1 relaxes with a characteristic time @xmath2 . in this limit ,",
    "it is appropriate to make the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium  @xcite : in thought , the system is subdivided into volumes that are small compared to the large scale structures of interest and that are , at the same time , large enough to allow for a thermodynamic ( equilibrium ) description . based in this assumption",
    ", a free energy can be defined for the full system which is out of equilibrium .",
    "the change with time of the free energy can be expressed as a sum of products of generalized forces and fluxes .",
    "then , the fluxes are expressed in terms of the forces , where only terms of linear order are considered .",
    "the resulting description is purely phenomenological and only depends on the modes under consideration as well as the symmetries of the system .",
    "we will apply this approach to muscle fibers , which will be considered as one - dimensional one - component complex fluids .",
    "first , we have to identify the hydrodynamic modes of the systems . in general",
    ", they are associated with conservation laws or broken continuous symmetries .",
    "the muscle fiber is an essentially one - dimensional system with the order of the actin and myosin filaments being fixed .",
    "consequently the system does not offer any broken continuous symmetry .",
    "there are three conserved quantities : the fiber mass , momentum and energy . in experiments ,",
    "the fluid surrounding the fiber essentially provides a heat bath such that temperature is constant and energy conservation is not an issue .",
    "note , that this no longer holds for muscle , which heat up when active .",
    "conservation of mass and momentum implies @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mass density along the fiber and @xmath5 its local velocity , and @xmath6 in this expression the stress @xmath7 gives the momentum flux density @xmath8 and @xmath9 is an externally applied force . for the dynamic phenomena we consider , inertia is irrelevant , such that eq .",
    "( [ eq : momconserv ] ) reduces to a force - balance relation between internal stresses and external forces .    under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium ,",
    "changes in the system s free energy can be expressed as @xmath10 it can thus be written as a sum of products , where in each product , a generalized flux is multiplied with its conjugate generalized force . in the present case ,",
    "the fluxes are taken to be the stress @xmath7 and the rate of atp - hydrolysis @xmath11 .",
    "the force conjugate to @xmath7 is the rate of strain @xmath12 , the force conjugate to @xmath11 the difference @xmath13 in chemical potentials of atp and its hydrolysis products adp and p@xmath0 , @xmath14 .",
    "note , that since the density changes by relative sliding of actin filaments and motor filaments , we assume that the system is infinitely compressible . consequently , the pressure vanishes .    in the next step",
    ", the generalized fluxes are expanded in terms of the generalized forces up to linear order . to this end",
    "the fluxes have to be separated into their reactive and their dissipative components .",
    "the dissipative component of a flux has the same sign with respect to time - reversal as its conjugate flux , the reactive component has the opposite sign .",
    "the corresponding changes in the free energy are thus , respectively , irreversible and reversible with respect to time - reversal . the respective components of a flux can be expanded only in terms of forces with the same behavior under time - reversal . with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where the superscripts @xmath11 and @xmath17 discriminate between the reactive and the dissipative parts , respectively ,",
    "we get @xmath18 the phenomenological coefficient @xmath19 accounts for the effects of an internal friction in the muscle fiber , while @xmath20 determines the rate of atp - hydrolysis given a difference in chemical potentials @xmath13 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath21 is a measure of the contribution to the stress by active processes , i.e. , the action of motors .",
    "the coefficients in front of the cross - terms must be equal up to a sign due to the onsager relations .",
    "equations ( [ eq : redis1])-([eq : redis4 ] ) provide the constitutive equations for an active fluid and thus take no account of the passive elastic response of a muscle fiber .",
    "such a response , however , is expected in a passive fiber , @xmath22 , due to the elastic elements of sarcomeres , which help to maintain structural integrity",
    ". consequently , on large time scales , one expects an elastic response also in the active case .",
    "the short time behavior in the passive case is somewhat more subtle .",
    "the motor molecules constantly detach from actin filaments and rebind .",
    "this dynamics leads to a viscous response of the system  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the passive system shows visco - elastic behavior .",
    "note , that on very short time scales , bound motors will lead to an additional elastic response .",
    "we will neglect this contribution and consider only one relaxation time .",
    "in contrast to theories of active polar gels  @xcite , we thus have viscous behavior on short and elastic behavior on long time scales .",
    "we will model this behavior of the passive system by the kelvin - voigt model of a linear spring and a dashpot acting in parallel , such that the elastic and the viscous stresses simply add .",
    "the elastic part is given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the equilibrium density and @xmath25 the elastic modulus .",
    "the elastic part must be added to the reactive component of the stress in eq .",
    "( [ eq : redis3 ] ) .    for the analysis of the dynamic equations ( [ eq : redis1])-([eq : redis4 ] )",
    ", we take a dependence of the active stress on the density @xmath4 into account : as the overlap between the actin filaments and the motor filaments increase , the active stress changes for constant @xmath13 .",
    "we therefore expand @xmath21 in terms of @xmath4 , while keeping only terms up to first order , @xmath26 . in the case that the only external force results from friction with the surrounding fluid , we write @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the corresponding friction coefficient . combining this expression with the dynamic equations for @xmath4 , the time evolution of deviations @xmath4 from the equilibrium distribution @xmath24 is determined up to linear order by @xmath29 if @xmath30 , a perturbation of the equilibrium state will thus grow leading to a contracted state .",
    "the condition states essentially that the active stresses must be larger than the passive elastic stresses .",
    "note , however , that the dynamic equation for the fiber density does not allow for wave solutions .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , the oscillation mechanism of muscle fibers involves non - hydrodynamic modes . in this section",
    ", we will propose a microscopic model of the dynamics of muscle fibers .",
    "first , we present the dynamics of a half - sarcomere and show that it is able to oscillate spontaneously .",
    "we then study the dynamics of a chain of such elements and compare it to the experimental observations on muscle fibers .",
    "finally , we obtain the continuum limit of the chain and compare it to the description developed in the previous section .",

    "( [ eq : drhodtcont ] ) has the same form as the hydrodynamic equation of motion ( [ eq : hydroeqnofmotion ] ) and relations ( [ eq : c1 ] ) and ( [ eq : c2 ] ) relate the phenomenological parameters to microscopic parameters .",
    "we again find , that the dynamics of the fraction @xmath62 of bound motors , which clearly is not a hydrodynamic mode , is essential for obtaining waves along the a chain of half - sarcomeres . a linear stability of the homogenous stationary state of eqs .  ( [ eq : drhodtcont ] ) and ( [ eq : dqdtcont ] ) yields the same necessary condition as above for oscillatory solutions , @xmath77 as found above .",
    "in the preceding sections , we have presented theoretical descriptions of the dynamics of muscle fibers . using a hydrodynamic approach where the system is described as a one - dimensional complex fluid close to thermodynamic equilibrium",
    ", we obtained a bound on the system s activity to obtain contraction .",
    "based upon a microscopic model of half - sarcomeres , we found oscillatory states that correspond to traveling waves along the fiber .",
    "the essential ingredient underlying this dynamic behavior is contained in a force dependence of the binding - unbinding kinetics of myosin motors to actin filaments .",
    "spontaneous oscillations of sarcomeres and contraction waves along muscle fibers are observed experimentally and have been studied intensively  @xcite . in the following paragraphs",
    ", we will compare experimental findings to our theoretical results .",
    "first of all , sarcomeres have been observed to spontaneously oscillate under constant non - physiological conditions  @xcite .",
    "they consist of a slow contraction and a fast expansion phase , leading to a saw - tooth pattern of the sarcomere extension vs. time curve .",
    "it was shown experimentally that the oscillations are not induced by resonances with an external load , leading to the conjecture that spontaneous oscillations should be possible also in the absence of an external load  @xcite .",
    "our ( half-)sarcomere model generates behavior that is certainly consistent with these results and conclusions .    by choosing parameter values that are compatible with the values known from muscle and muscle myosin , the oscillatory solutions we find match the experimentally observed semi - quantitatively .",
    "parameters could always be fitted such that the experimentally observed period and amplitude of the oscillations match exactly .",
    "note , however , that these differ for different kinds of muscle .",
    "we therefore chose one typical set of parameters as explained in [ app : parameters ] without aiming at quantitatively matching a particular experiment .",
    "parameter values have been systematically varied in experiments .",
    "unfortunately , variations in the chemical composition of the buffer solution , are not readily translated into changes of the parameter values we employ in our model .",
    "this holds in particular for the activity of the motors . in the buffers",
    "studied experimentally , motors are always only partially activated .",
    "the degree of the activation , however , is not assessed directly .",
    "still , a few comparisons can be made .",
    "first of all , the oscillation frequency does not depend on the applied external force  @xcite .",
    "the same holds for the critical frequency at the onset of the oscillatory instability in the model .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the oscillatory regime is an intermediate state between relaxation and contraction  @xcite that can be continuously connected by changing the degree of motor activity  @xcite .",
    "changes in the degree of motor activity , can in our model for example be described by increasing the binding rate @xmath74 of motors to the polar filament . in that case",
    ", we also observe a transition from a relaxed state , to an oscillatory state and then a maximally contracted state , see fig .",
    "[ fig : linstab]b .",
    "experimentally , spontaneous oscillations are observed only if a moderate external force is applied  @xcite . at first sight , this might be incompatible with the phase diagram presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : linstab]a . indeed ,",
    "if only the external force is varied , then the system can at best be driven form an oscillating state to a non - oscillating one .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind , that we have made the assumption of linear elastic elements . in a sarcomere ,",
    "though , the elasticity is non - linear . while for the oscillations",
    "it is not essential to keep the non - linearity , it implies that with the application of an external forces also the value of the effective stiffness @xmath35 changes ( it might either increase or decrease ) . by describing a curvilinear path in the ( @xmath9,@xmath35)-plane when",
    "changing @xmath9 , the experimental observation and the theoretical results can be compatible .",
    "furthermore , changes in the external force might affect other model parameters , for example , through the mechanism of stretch activation .",
    "as already mentioned in the previous section , all the kinds of traveling waves observed in experiments have their counter - part in solutions to the chain equations .",
    "in particular , the propagation speed in terms of relative phase shifts between adjacent sarcomeres compares nicely .    in our analysis",
    ", we have neglected the effects of noise in our system .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a similar approach was followed to describe oscillations of mitotic spindles during asymmetric cell division , that the mean - field analysis faithfully reproduced the features of the stochastic system .",
    "the same can be expected to hold in the present case .    in summary , we have presented a first semi - quantitative analysis of spontaneous oscillations of muscle fibers .",
    "it will now be interesting to design experiments that could specifically change parameters of the model and thereby test the importance of a force - dependent binding - unbinding kinetics of molecular motors for the observed oscillations . due to the wide - spread appearance of motor oscillations ,",
    "a quantitative combined experimental and theoretical study will likely help us to understand various cellular processes .",
    "in this appendix , we discuss the parameter values that we have used in our numerical solutions of the dynamic equations presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : dyneq ] .",
    "as the parameter values differ for the various kinds of muscle used in experiments , we will present here typical values rather than trying to argue why a specific value has to be chosen for describing a particular experiment .",
    "let us start by geometric considerations .",
    "a typical rest length of an inactive sarcomere is @xmath109 m  @xcite , so we take @xmath110 m , where @xmath50 is the rest length of the elastic element of a half - sarcomere .",
    "typical lengths of actin filaments are @xmath111 m and @xmath112 m for myosin filaments , the latter consisting of about 300 myosin - ii molecules  @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the average distance between two adjacent motors on a myosin filament is @xmath113 nm .    in a muscle fiber , the approximately 1000 myosin filaments are arranged in a hexagonal lattice interdigitating with a hexagonal lattice of actin filaments . in a slice of thickness @xmath68 perpendicular to the orientation of the filaments , however , only a fraction of the motors can actually bind to an actin filament .",
    "this is because myosin binding sites are evenly spread on an actin filament every 37 nm . assuming that a motor head can bind within 4 nm around its equilibrium position with respect to the motor filament , we arrive at about 100 motors that actually can bind in a slice of thickness @xmath68 .    as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sec : dyneq ] , an ensemble of @xmath114 non - processive myosin - ii can be considered as one effectively processive motor .",
    "the time an individual motor spends bound to an actin filament is about 5ms  @xcite . as in the experiments motors are only partially activated  @xcite , we choose here @xmath115ms .",
    "the binding rate can then be inferred from the duty ratio @xmath11 , which gives the fraction of time a motor is attached to a filament during a whole cycle .",
    "we choose @xmath116 which is in the middle of the predicted range  @xcite . from the values of individual motors ,",
    "the parameters characterizing the effective motor can be inferred  @xcite . for the effective motor , we furthermore choose a stall force @xmath117pn and a load - free velocity @xmath118 m/s .",
    "these values are lower than what might be obtained from single molecule experiments and again account for the only partial activation of motors in the experiments .",
    "the elastic components entering our model are experimentally hard to assess .",
    "single molecule experiments with myosin - ii suggest a stiffness of the linker of the head to the motor filament of the order of @xmath119pn / nm  @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of measurements of @xmath35 .",
    "contributions come from titin molecules  @xcite the z - discs and other elements .",
    "we choose @xmath120pn / nm .",
    "similarly , the microscopic length scale @xmath41 is unknown .",
    "it must be of molecular dimensions and we choose @xmath121 nm . experiments are carried out at room temperature , such that @xmath122pn nm .    finally , friction in muscle fibers results from protein - protein friction as well as from hydrodynamic friction .",
    "their effects are lumped into the parameter @xmath19 . assuming a viscosity of ten times the viscosity of water @xmath123pa s , we use for the effective friction coefficient @xmath124pn s@xmath125 m ."
