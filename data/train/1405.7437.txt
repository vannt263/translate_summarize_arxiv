    "collimated outflows , or jets , with relativistic speeds are observed in active galactic nuclei and galactic microquasars , and are presumably driven in gamma - ray bursts .",
    "possible mechanisms for driving relativistic jets include the electromagnetic extraction of the rotational energy of a central black hole ( bh ) @xcite , the electromagnetic extraction of the rotational energy of an accretion flow around a bh @xcite , and the thermal gas ejection from an accretion flow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the electromagnetic extraction of the rotational energy of the accretion flow is the same mechanism as pulsar winds .",
    "@xcite showed that when the poloidal magnetic field is penetrating a rotating conductive star , the steady force - free magnetosphere can be established outside the star , where the poloidal electric fields are maintained by the charge distribution and the poloidal currents flow ( i.e. , the unipolar induction process ) . as a result ,",
    "outward electromagnetic energy and angular momentum fluxes continue to be generated .",
    "the origin of the electromotive force ( and the fluxes ) is the matter - dominated rotating star , while the plasma outside the star only supports the electromagnetic field , playing a passive role for keeping the electric potential differences in the whole system .    as for the energy extraction of the bh itself ,",
    "@xcite first showed a mathematical solution for the electromagnetic energy and angular momentum fluxes extracted from the bh with the force - free approximation in the slow rotation limit of the bh , in a similar mechanism to the goldreich - julian model .",
    "it has been frequently argued that this electromagnetic process may be the only viable process to extract the rotational energy from a bh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , the origin of the electromotive force in this process is still being debated .",
    "there is no matter - dominated region in which the poloidal magnetic field is anchored , and all the matter in the bh magnetosphere only plays a passive role .",
    "then it is not a simple question what determines the electric potential difference ( or the so - called angular velocity of the magnetic field line @xmath3 ) and drives the poloidal currents .",
    "the literature on the origin of the electromotive force focuses on either the event horizon @xcite , the wind separation surface @xcite , or the ergosphere @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the first one is unlikely because the event horizon is causally disconnected from the bh exterior @xcite .",
    "the above literature mainly uses the analytical methods , while the numerical simulations based on the ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) approximation have been actively performed to investigate the nature of the bh magnetosphere ( and even its interaction with the accretion flow ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on the simulation results , it was proposed that the unavoidable rotation of the fluids in the ergosphere generates mhd waves propagating outwards , and its feedback causes the fluids to have negative hydrodynamic energy as measured at infinity .",
    "they plunge into the bh , decreasing its rotational energy @xcite .",
    "however , the long - term simulations have demonstrated that no regions of negative hydrodynamic energy are seen in the steady state @xcite , and thus more studies are required to understand the real mechanism of the extraction of the bh rotational energy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has not been discussed what determines the value of @xmath3 and drives the poloidal currents by utilizing the mhd simulation results , as far as we are aware .    since the blandford - znajek process is purely electromagnetic , the force - free simulations appear more suitable than the mhd simulations for investigating the nature of its mechanism ( without including the complicated interaction of the bh magnetosphere with the accretion flow ) .",
    "@xcite clearly shows that when the bh exterior is vacuum , the electric field ( the @xmath0 field ) can be stronger than the magnetic field ( the @xmath1 field ) in the ergosphere , and performed the resistive force - free numerical simulations of the plasma - filled bh magnetosphere , demonstrating that such a strong electric field drives the poloidal currents .",
    "a similar conclusion was drawn from simulation results of the force - free electromagnetic field on highly compact regular space - times ( i.e. , with no event horizon ) with an ergosphere @xcite . however , it has not been evident why the electric field is maintained to be strong in the plasma - filled bh magnetosphere and how the steady state with @xmath4 and non - zero poloidal currents is realized .",
    "a related question is whether the steady state with @xmath5 and/or zero poloidal currents is possible or not .    in this paper , we extend the argument of @xcite , providing more general insights .",
    "we consider the steady , axisymmetric kerr bh magnetosphere filled with a collisionless plasma satisfying @xmath6 , and show in a fully analytical way that for open magnetic field lines threading the ergosphere , the state with @xmath4 and non - zero poloidal currents is forced to be maintained , i.e. , the outward poynting flux inevitably keeps being generated .",
    "the origin of the electromotive force is ascribed to the ergosphere .",
    "we show a self - consistent electromagnetic structure along an open field line threading the equatorial plane in the ergosphere , and deduce the range of the possible value of @xmath3 for such field lines .",

    "it is interesting that the plasma enhances the strength of the electric field across the magnetic field , although it screens that along the magnetic field ( satisfying @xmath24 ) .",
