    "the purpose of this paper is to develop the geometric foundations for multisymplectic - momentum integrators for variational partial differential equations ( pdes ) .",
    "these integrators are the pde generalizations of symplectic integrators that are popular for hamiltonian odes ( see , for example , the articles in marsden , patrick and shadwick [ 1996 ] , and especially the review article of mclachlan and scovel [ 1996 ] ) in that they are covariant spacetime integrators which preserve the geometric structures of the system .    because of the covariance of our method which we shall describe below , the resulting integrators are spacetime localizable in the context of hyperbolic pdes , and generalize the notion of symplecticity and symmetry preservation in the context of elliptic problems . herein , we shall primarily focus on spacetime integrators ; however , we shall remark on the connection of our method with the finite element method for elliptic problems , as well as the gregory and lin [ 1991 ] method in optimal control .",
    "historically , in the setting of odes , there have been many approaches devised for constructing symplectic integrators , beginning with the original derivations based on generating functions ( see de vogelaere [ 1956 ] ) and proceeding to symplectic runge - kutta algorithms , the shake algorithm , and many others .",
    "in fact , in many areas of molecular dynamics , symplectic integrators such as the verlet algorithm and variants thereof are quite popular , as are symplectic integrators for the integration of the solar system . in these domains , integrators that are either symplectic or which are adaptations of symplectic integrators , are amongst the most",
    "widely used .",
    "a fundamentally new approach to symplectic integration is that of veselov [ 1988 ] , [ 1991 ] who developed a discrete mechanics based on a discretization of hamilton s principle .",
    "their method leads in a natural way to symplectic - momentum integrators which include the shake and verlet integrators as special cases ( see wendlandt and marsden [ 1997 ] ) .",
    "in addition , veselov integrators often have amazing properties with regard to preservation of integrable structures , as has been shown by moser and veselov [ 1991 ] .",
    "this aspect has yet to be exploited numerically , but it seems to be quite important .    the approach we take in this paper is to develop a veselov - type discretization for pde s in variational form .",
    "the relevant geometry for this situation is multisymplectic geometry ( see gotay , isenberg , and marsden [ 1997 ] and marsden and shkoller [ 1997 ] ) and we develop it in a variational framework . as we have mentioned , this naturally leads to multisymplectic - momentum integrators .",
    "it is well - known that such integrators can not in general preserve the hamiltonian _ exactly _ ( ge and marsden [ 1988 ] ) .",
    "however , these integrators have , under appropriate circumstances , very good energy performance in the sense of the conservation of a nearby hamiltonian up to exponentially small errors , assuming small time steps , due to a result of neishtadt [ 1984 ] .",
    "see also dragt and finn [ 1979 ] , and simo and gonzales [ 1993 ] .",
    "this is related to backward error analysis ; see sanz - serna and calvo [ 1994 ] , calvo and hairer [ 1995 ] , and the recent work of hyman , newman and coworkers and references therein",
    ". it would be quite interesting to develop the links with neishtadt s analysis more thoroughly .",
    "an important part of our approach is to understand how the symplectic nature of the integrators is implied by the variational structure . in this way",
    "we are able to identify the symplectic and momentum conserving properties after discretizing the variational principle itself .",
    "inspired by a paper of wald [ 1993 ] , we obtain a formal method for locating the symplectic or multisymplectic structures directly from the action function and its derivatives .",
    "we present the method in the context of ordinary lagrangian mechanics , and apply it to discrete lagrangian mechanics , and both continuous and discrete multisymplectic field theory .",
    "while in these contexts our variational method merely uncovers the well - known differential - geometric structures , our method forms an excellent pedagogical approach to those theories .",

    "we show that the usual symplectic @xmath0-form on the tangent bundle of the configuration manifold arises naturally as the boundary term in the first variational principle .",
    "we then show that application of @xmath1 to the variational principle restricted to the space of solutions of the euler - lagrange equations produces the familiar concept of conservation of the symplectic form ; this statement is obtained variationally in a non - dynamic context ; that is , we do not require an evolutionary flow .",
    "we then show that if the action function is left invariant by a symmetry group , then noether s theorem follows directly and simply from the variational principle as well .",
    "* here we use our variational approach to construct discretization schemes for mechanics which preserve the discrete symplectic form and the associated discrete momentum mappings . *",
    "this section defines the three aspects of our variational approach in the multisymplectic field - theoretic setting . unlike the traditional approach of defining the canonical multisymplectic form on the dual of the first jet bundle and then pulling back to the lagrangian side using the covariant legendre transform ,",
    "we obtain the geometric structure by staying entirely on the lagrangian side .",
    "we prove the covariant analogue of the fact that the flow of conservative systems consists of symplectic maps ; we call this result the _ multisymplectic form formula_. after variationally proving a covariant version of noether s theorem , we show that one can use the multisymplectic form formula to recover the usual notion of symplecticity of the flow in an infinite - dimensional space of fields by making a spacetime split .",
    "we demonstrate this machinery using a nonlinear wave equation as an example .",
    "* in this section we develop discrete field theories from which the covariant integrators follow .",
    "we define discrete analogues of the first jet bundle of the configuration bundle whose sections are the fields of interest , and proceed to define the discrete action sum .",
    "we then apply our variational algorithm to this discrete action function to produce the discrete euler - lagrange equations and the discrete multisymplectic forms . as a consequence of our methodology",
    ", we show that the solutions of the discrete euler - lagrange equations satisfy the discrete version of the multisymplectic form formula as well as the discrete version of our generalized noether s theorem . using our nonlinear wave equation example , we develop various multisymplectic - momentum integrators for the sine - gordon equations , and compare our resulting numerical scheme with the energy - conserving methods of li and vu - quoc [ 1995 ] and guo , pascual , rodriguez , and vazquez [ 1986 ] .",

    "there is an interesting connection between our variational construction of multisymplectic - momentum integrators and the finite element method ( fem ) for elliptic boundary value problems .",
    "fem is also a variationally derived numerical scheme , fundamentally differing from our approach in the following way : whereas we form a discrete action sum and compute its first variation to obtain the discrete euler - lagrange equations , in fem , it is the original continuum action function which is used together with a projection of the fields and their variations onto appropriately chosen finite - dimensional spaces .",
    "one varies the projected fields and integrates such variations over the spatial domain to recover the discrete equations . in general",
    ", the two discretization schemes do not agree , but for certain classes of finite element bases with particular integral approximations , the resulting discrete equations match the discrete euler - lagrange equations obtained by our method , and are hence naturally multisymplectic .",
    "to illustrate this concept , we consider the gregory and lin method of solving two - point boundary value problems in optimal control . in this scheme ,",
    "the discrete equations are obtained using a finite element method with a basis of linear interpolants . over each one - dimensional element ,",
    "let @xmath750 and @xmath751 be the two linear interpolating functions . as usual",
    ", we define the action function by @xmath752 .",
    "discretizing the interval @xmath753 $ ] into @xmath158@xmath754@xmath25 uniform elements , we may write the action with fields projected onto the linear basis as @xmath755 since the euler - lagrange equations are obtained by linearizing the action and hence the lagrangian , and as the functions @xmath756 are linear , one may easily check that by evaluating the integrals in the linearized equations using a trapezoidal rule , the discrete euler - lagrange equations given in ( [ 12 ] ) are obtained .",
    "thus , the gregory and lin method is actually a multisymplectic - momentum algorithm .",
    "fluid problems are not literally covered by the theory presented here because their symmetry groups ( particle relabeling symmetries ) are not vertical .",
    "a generalization is needed to cover this case and we propose to work out such a generalization in a future paper , along with numerical implementation , especially for geophysical fluid problems in which conservation laws such as conservation of enstrophy and kelvin theorems more generally are quite important .      it remains to link the approaches here with other types of integrators , such as volume preserving integrators ( see , eg , kang and shang [ 1995 ] , quispel [ 1995 ] ) and reversible integrators ( see , eg , stoffer [ 1995 ] ) . in particular",
    "since volume manifolds may be regarded as multisymplectic manifolds , it seems reasonable that there is an interesting link .",
    "one of the very nice things about the veselov construction is the way it handles constraints , both theoretically and numerically ( see wendlandt and marsden [ 1997 ] ) . for field theories",
    "one would like to have a similar theory .",
    "for example , it is interesting that for fluids , the incompressibility constraint can be expressed as a pointwise constraint on the first jet of the particle placement field , namely that its jacobian be unity .",
    "when viewed this way , it appears as a holonomic constraint and it should be amenable to the present approach . under reduction by the particle relabeling group ,",
    "such a constraint of course becomes the divergence free constraint and one would like to understand how these constraints behave under both reduction and discretization .",
    "we would like to extend our gratitude to darryl holm , tudor ratiu and jeff wendlandt for their time , encouragement and invaluable input .",
