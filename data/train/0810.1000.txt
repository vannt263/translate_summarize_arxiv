    "in the higgs mechanism of the standard model , the fermions and weak gauge bosons acquire mass via interaction with the higgs field @xcite . therefore the existence of this yet to be discovered particle is the cornerstone of the standard model .",
    "the search for the higgs boson is one of the most active areas of research at the tevatron .",
    "the electroweak fits to sm parameters , performed including the latest tevatron top mass averaged measurements , point to the value @xmath3 , which yields an upper limit of @xmath4  at 95% c.l .",
    "@xcite . in the mass region below 135 gev/@xmath5 the searches of higgs boson production in association with a vector boson provide the cleanest signatures due to the requirement of the presence of decay products of the z or w. the dominant decay mode of the higgs boson in this mass range is @xmath6 .",
    "we present a search for the higgs boson in events with no identified leptons , large missing transverse energy ( @xmath1 ) and two or three jets , at least one of which originates from a @xmath7-quark .",
    "this channel is especially challenging since the cross - sections of the background processes are many orders of magnitude higher than the signal , even after requiring the final state topology .",
    "if the higgs boson mass is less than 135 gev , the associated production cross sections are of the order of 0.30.2 pb , which results in the signal to background ratio of about @xmath8 after the trigger selections .",
    "it is thus necessary to employ sophisticated event selection which reduces backgrounds to a more manageable size .",
    "we use data collected by the cdf experiment through august 2007 , which corresponds to 2.1 @xmath2 integrated luminosity .",
    "the events are collected by cdf ii detector with a trigger that selects events with @xmath9 gev at level 1 at least two level 2 clusters with @xmath10 gev and @xmath11 gev at level 3 .    in the first step of the analysis ,",
    "both the monte carlo simulation and the cdf data events must pass quality cuts to ensure that the possible beam and detector effects are removed from the data sample .",
    "the standard cdf jet clustering algorithm is used with a jet cone of radius 0.4 .",
    "jet energies are corrected for calorimeter non - uniformity , non - linearity and energy loss in the un - instrumented regions of calorimeter and energy coming from different @xmath12 interactions during the same bunch crossing .",
    "the key element to distinguish the higgs boson signal from background events is the invariant mass of the @xmath0 system , which for signal has a sharp peak around the higgs boson mass , while the backgrounds have smoother distributions .",
    "obtaining the best possible resolution of the @xmath13 is thus crucial for higgs boson searches , since it provides the most discriminating feature of the signal . in order to improve the @xmath13 resolution , we correct jet energies by reconstructing their four - momenta according to an algorithm developed by h1 collaboration , using tracking information @xcite .",
    "this technique allows us to improve the dijet mass resolution by around 10% .",
    "traditionally the searches in this channel have analyzed events with two jets , in order to keep the background rates low .",
    "for the first time at cdf in this analysis we analyzed events with three jets in this channel .",
    "the main motivation is to accept events where one of the _ b _ quarks coming from the higgs boson radiates a gluon , resulting in a three jet event .",
    "in addition to that , we add acceptance to wh events where the charged lepton coming from the w is reconstructed as a jet .",
    "the latter case happens when the w decays to @xmath14 and the electron fails the isolation requirements , and is reconstructed as a jet ; or when the @xmath15 decays to @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this is the first cdf search to make use of events in @xmath18 channel with @xmath19 identified as a jet . according to monte - carlo simulations of wh events , around 30% of three jet signal events accepted in this analysis",
    "contain one jet matched to hadronic decays of a @xmath19 .    as a way to get a better estimate of the event true missing energy we calculate the @xmath20 , which is defined as the magnitude of the negative vectorial sum of charged particle track @xmath21 s .",
    "for true @xmath1 events @xmath20 is highly correlated with calorimetric @xmath1 , while for qcd events with mismeasured jets it is not .",
    "thus , @xmath20 provides an additional handle to separate mismeasurements from real @xmath1 events .    in order to enhance the signal purity ,",
    "we require that at least one of the two leading jets in the event is identified as a @xmath7-jet . jets originating from @xmath7-quarks can be identified ( _ `` @xmath7-tagged '' _ ) by exploiting the long lifetime of the @xmath7 hadrons by finding their decay vertices , which are significantly displaced from the interaction point .",
    "while the events with two @xmath7-tags provide the most sensitivity in this analysis , the single - tagged sample adds about @xmath22 to the overall sensitivity .",
    "the contributions from the following background processes are considered in this analysis : qcd multi - jet production , top quark pair and single production , w or z boson production with jets and diboson production ( ww , wz , zz ) . the processes which yield events with @xmath7 or @xmath23 quarks , were estimated using monte - carlo calculations .    the most significant background in this analysis is the qcd multijet production , which has a production cross - section of several orders of magnitude higher than signal .",
    "although these processes generally do not have intrinsic @xmath1 , mismeasured jets can cause imbalance in the total transverse energy , faking the signal if one of the jets is mis - tagged .",
    "furthermore , qcd b - quark pair production yields taggable jets and if one @xmath7 undergoes a semi - leptonic decay large @xmath1 .",
    "the qcd multijet background is estimated from data , which allows us to estimate not only the heavy flavor qcd production , but also processes with a light flavor jet falsely tagged as a @xmath7-quark .",
    "the data driven technique enabled us to considerably reduce the systematic uncertainty associated with the qcd estimation .    in order to validate our ability to predict the sample composition we test our model in three separate control region . all the important kinematic variables and correlations between them are tested in these regions , before analyzing the data in the signal region , i.e. we perform a _",
    "`` blind '' _ analysis .",
    "we employ an artificial neural network ( nn ) using multi layer perceptron @xcite to reject the majority of qcd mulitijet events , which are the main source of background in this analysis .",
    "these processes have a very different behavior with respect to the signal and the remaining backgrounds , since they are mostly caused by instrumental effects .",
    "the network is trained on a mixture of 50@xmath24 wh and 50@xmath24 zh events against qcd events . in order to achieve the maximum sensitivity , all the events with the output of the qcd rejection nn below zero",
    "are rejected , fig.[fig : qcdnn ] .",
    "the remaining events constitute the signal region , where we will search for a presence of the higgs boson .",
    "this selection requirement provides 95% signal efficiency while rejecting 50% of all the backgrounds . by employing three exclusive tagging categories",
    "we expect 7.3 signal events after final selections , assuming @xmath25 gev/@xmath5 .",
    "the expected signal yield is a factor of 2 greater than in the past versions of the analysis , due to improved event selection techniques and use of events in multiple tagging categories .    once the signal region is defined , we train a discriminant nn to further separate multijet and top pair production from signal , fig.[fig : nn ] .",
    "the discriminant nn uses seven input variables , including invariant mass of all jets in the event , which is shown in fig.[fig : mjjj ] .",
    "we scan the distribution of the output of the discriminant nn for an excess of observed data using binned likelihood technique .",
    "the likelihoods from events with one or two @xmath7-tags are multiplied together .",
    "analyzing 2.1 @xmath2 of the cdf data we find a good agreement between expected background predictions and the observed data . in the sample with two @xmath7-tags , which provides the most sensitivity in this search",
    ", we find 105 candidate events with an expectation of @xmath26 background and 1.9 signal events , assuming @xmath25 gev/@xmath5 . since no significant excess is observed , we compute the expected upper limit for the higgs boson cross - section when the higgs boson is produced in association with a z / w boson and decays to two @xmath7-quarks where z decays to neutrinos and w to leptons .",
    "we use the bayesian likelihood method for deriving the expected and observed upper limit at 95% c.l . of 6.3 and 7.9 times the standard model cross section",
    "respectively for @xmath27 = 115 gev/@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this result achieves an improvement of 30% in sensitivity with respect to the previous version of the search in the same channel , and provides one of the most stringent limits on higgs boson production cross - section among various tevatron searches .",
