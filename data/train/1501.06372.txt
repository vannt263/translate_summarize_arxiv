    "increasing demand in miniaturization of functional elements of devices has tremendously stimulated research in the physics of domain walls in recent decades  @xcite .",
    "the walls separating different domains are often found to have new properties different from those of the domains .",
    "the examples of such exploitable phenomena are ferroelectric domain walls separating paraelectric domains  @xcite , conducting domain walls between insulating domains  @xcite , and superconducting twin walls  @xcite .",
    "thus , domain walls provide new physics , which can be used to create new types of devices , such as , for example , the racetrack memory  @xcite and magnetic domain wall logic  @xcite or can be used as injectors / detectors of spin currents  @xcite .    at the same time",
    "the last decade has seen rapid increase of interest in materials showing multiferroic properties  @xcite .",
    "ferroelectromagnets ( i.e. materials showing independent magnetic and ferroelectric orders ) and magnetoelectrics ( i.e. materials displaying magnetically induced ferroelectric order ) are of particular interest due to the possibility of creating new types of devices such as , for example , devices for reading , writing , and storage of information  @xcite , various sensors  @xcite , microwave  @xcite and spintronics  @xcite devices , and wireless energy transfer and energy harvesting technologies  @xcite .",
    "technological applications of multiferroics discovered to date , however , are still significantly hindered by a number of their properties .",
    "ferroelectromagnets usually show high temperatures of ferroelectric and magnetic phase transitions and high electric polarization",
    ". however , the usually large difference between the temperatures of the magnetic and ferroelectric phase transitions and the difference in the sources of the two orders result in low magnetoelectric response  @xcite . in turn , magnetoelectrics show direct coupling between magnetic order and induced electric polarization , but possess low magnetic phase transition temperatures and low electric polarization values .",
    "the magnetoelectric with the highest phase transition temperature discovered to date is cupric oxide cuo  @xcite , which displays modulated magnetic order and ferroelectricity between approximately 210 and 230  k.    the microscopic nature of the magnetoelectric effect is usually interpreted using the inverse dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction  @xcite or the spin - current model  @xcite . in both models",
    "the electric polarization arises as the result of interaction of two neighboring noncollinear spins .",
    "however , single ion contribution to the microscopic origin of the magnetically induced polarization was shown to exist  @xcite .",
    "common occurrence of modulated magnetic structures in magnetoelectrics has led to pervasive notion that incommensurate magnetic order such as , for example , spiral or cycloidal is necessary to induce electric polarization  @xcite .",
    "however , ferroelectricity can be induced by commensurate magnetic structures , which is observed , for example , in rmn@xmath1o@xmath2 ( r = rare - earth ) magnetoelectrics  @xcite .",
    "the intimate coupling between modulated magnetic order and magnetically induced electric polarization can be understood as the symmetry property of the relevant magnetic order parameters , which allow lifshitz invariants responsible for modulation and induce improper ferroelectric phases  @xcite .",
    "two approaches exist to macroscopically describe the magnetoelectric interaction .",
    "the first one consists in inclusion of the terms in the thermodynamic potential , which can be schematically written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are coordinates , @xmath6 is the electric polarization component , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are either different components of a single magnetic order parameter or two different magnetic order parameters .",
    "such magnetoelectric effect due to inhomogeneous magnetic order was first studied in  @xcite , where the calculation of electric polarization of bloch and nel magnetic domain walls was outlined .",
    "subsequently , the same ideas were used to describe the bulk magnetoelectric effect in spiral magnets  @xcite and led to the appearance of the term _ flexomagnetoelectric _ effect  @xcite .",
    "the second approach consists in considering the contribution to the thermodynamic potential of the form @xmath9 such macroscopic coupling was successfully used to interpret magnetoelectric phenomena in a number of magnetoelectrics  @xcite .",
    "apparently both interactions  ( [ eq : me_inter_flexo ] ) and  ( [ eq : me_inter_trilinear ] ) can describe magnetoelectric phenomena in many magnetoelectrics .",
    "however there is an important difference between them consisting in the fact that  ( [ eq : me_inter_flexo ] ) requires spatially varying magnetic order parameters to induce electric polarization .",
    "the experimental fact that ferroelectricity occurs mostly in spatially modulated magnetic structures together with the growing number of crystals showing polar magnetic domain walls , which is explained using flexomagnetoelectric interaction , give evidence in support of the interaction  ( [ eq : me_inter_flexo ] ) .",
    "however , the interaction  ( [ eq : me_inter_trilinear ] ) is capable of describing magnetoelectric effect in both incommensurate and commensurate magnetic structures and , therefore , provides equal footing for such description .",
    "the purpose of this work is twofold .",
    "firstly , we show that the walls separating the domains of low - temperature commensurate paraelectric magnetic phases of mnwo@xmath0 and cuo are polar .",
    "secondly , we show that this fact can be used to experimentally distinguish between the cases of interactions  ( [ eq : me_inter_flexo ] ) and  ( [ eq : me_inter_trilinear ] ) in theoretical description of magnetoelectric properties of mnwo@xmath0 .",

    "if similar polarization is revealed experimentally for both the @xmath20- and the @xmath81-walls , then one can argue that the relevant magnetoelectric interaction is  ( [ eq : me ] ) .    in the available literature the studies of the domains or domain walls in mnwo@xmath0",
    "are limited to those in the ferroelectric phase * af2 * and are mostly concerned with the dynamics of electric polarization switching by electric or magnetic fields  @xcite . in  @xcite the effect of poling electric field on ferroelectric properties of mnwo@xmath0 was studied .",
    "the authors observed nonzero electric polarization below @xmath14 when the sample was cooled down from @xmath121 under poling electric field of 10  kv  @xmath122 to temperatures below @xmath14 , after which the field was removed and a residual polarization was observed .",
    "this phenomenon was interpreted as enhancement of stability of the phase * af2 * by electric field , which results in surviving of the clusters of ferroelectric phase * af2 * in the paraelectric phase * af1*. the authors estimated the volume fraction of the phase * af2 * at @xmath123  k to be as high as 13% by comparing the polarization value to that of the pure phase * af2*. we agree with the authors of  @xcite that electric field enhances the stability of the phase * af2*. this enhancement , however , is present only when the poling field is applied to the sample and should disappear upon its removal , which at @xmath124 should result in a phase transition of the remains of the phase * af2 * to the phase * af1 * and disappearance of polarization . from our point of view",
    "the presence of electric polarization at temperatures below @xmath14 can be interpreted as polarization of walls between the domains of the phase * af1*. the poling electric field present upon the phase transition to paraelectric phase * af1 * from * af2 * should ( i ) pole the appearing domain walls and align their polarization along the field , and ( ii ) should in general increase the number of domains and , respectively , the number of the walls between them .",
    "therefore , we argue that these experimental results can be interpreted as supporting the picture of polar domain walls in the phase * af1 * suggested in the present work .",
    "the analogy in the phase transition sequences of mnwo@xmath0 and cuo , which is also reflected in similarity of their macroscopic descriptions  @xcite , argues that the same phenomena suggested for the low - temperature phase of mnwo@xmath0 in the present work can take place in the phase * af1 * of cuo",
    ". electric polarization of domain walls in the phase * af1 * of cuo will extend the exploitable temperature range of magnetoelectric properties of cuo down to 0  k from the rather narrow range 213  229  k of stability of the phase * af2*.",
    "we have shown that the walls between the domains of the low - temperature commensurate paraelectric phase * af1 * of mnwo@xmath0 and cuo are ferroelectric .",
    "the value and direction of electric polarization inside the walls coincide with those of the magnetoelectric phase * af2 * of the respective compounds",

    "<S> two prominent magnetoelectrics mnwo@xmath0 and cuo possess low - temperature commensurate paraelectric magnetically ordered phase . here </S>",
    "<S> using monte carlo simulations we show that the walls between the domains of this phase are ferroelectric with the same electric polarization direction and value as those in the magnetoelectric phases of these compounds . </S>",
    "<S> we also suggest that experimental observation of electric polarization of domain walls in mnwo@xmath0 should help to determine the macroscopic interactions responsible for its magnetoelectric properties . </S>"
