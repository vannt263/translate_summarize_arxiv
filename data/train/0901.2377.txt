    "the credit - debt relation between banks and firms is one of the most important relationships among economic agents .",
    "credit is a source of profit for a bank , and it is fuel for growth of a firm .",
    "the flip side of the relation is , however , the path where failures take place and their propagation occurs often at a nation - wide scale , and sometimes to a world - wide extent , as we experience today .",
    "it is well known that the japanese banking system suffered a considerable deterioration in its financial condition during the 1990s .",
    "financial institutions in private - sector had accumulated loan losses , more than 80 trillion yen ( nearly 15% of gdp ) , which reduced the bank capitalization , and led to the failure of three major and other small banks . even though two major banks were nationalized in 1997 , and other political decisions were made in order to maintain the stability of financial system , most banks , major and minor , decreased the supply of credit immediately ; even by reducing existing loans to firms .",
    "a lot of firms , especially small and medium - sized firms , eventually suffered loss of funding .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "financial systems are , at an aggregate level , subject to the tails of distributions for economic variables .",
    "this perspective has been recognized increasingly in economics ; personal income , firm - size , number of relationships among firms and banks ( ownership , supplier - customer , etc . ) , and so on .",
    "it has been recognized that distributions and fluctuations are the keys for understanding many phenomena in macro - economy ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "[ fig : doe_sml ] shows the historical data of the total amount of debt from banks for large firms and for small and medium firms . for the year 2005 , 1.25% ( 33,833 ) of domestic firms are the large firms according to the classification , while the rest 98.75% are the small - medium firms . yet the total loans for the large firms amount to be 160 billion yen , which is nearly equal to those for the small - medium firms as shown in the figure .",
    "thus , only a small fraction of firms account for half of all loans .",
    "conversely , as we shall show in this paper , a large part of loans is provided by a few large banks  the tail of another distribution .",
    "suppose a large firm is heavily indebted with banks .",
    "then a failure of the firm , or a default , may cause a considerable effect on the balance sheets of the banks .",
    "if the banks reduce their supply of credit , then the total supply of loans will be decreased resulting in the adverse shocks to other firms .",
    "therefore , the study of structure of credit relationships or _ credit network _ between banks and firms , and its temporal change would give us an insight to understand the financial stability or fragility .",
    "this is precisely the purpose of this paper .",
    "there are several related works in the literature .",
    "for example , @xcite carried out an analysis of dependency of the number of long - term credit relationships on characteristics of firms .",
    "@xcite studied the relation between bank - size and credit links .",
    "@xcite investigated the credit of small and medium - sized firms .",
    "studies such as @xcite focus on multiple lending relationships . recently ,",
    "complex network analysis ( see @xcite and references therein ) has been applied to financial systems ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for inter - bank relationships , @xcite , @xcite for bank - firm relationships ) . in this paper , we shall study on the credit network between banks and large firms by regarding the network as a _ weighted bipartite graph _",

    ", we describe our credit network dataset . in section  [ sec : nw_def ] , we consider a credit network as a weighted bipartite graph , and show several statistical properties of heavy - tailed distributions .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : nw_frag ] , we propose a set of scores for banks and firms which measure potential influences that one agent exerts on the other .",
    "it is shown that the scores can be calculated by solving an eigenvalue problem . in section  [ sec : nw_res ] , we apply this method to our dataset from the year 1980 to 2005 .",
    "the results are discussed in section  [ sec : disc ] .",

    "the data were compiled from the firms financial statements and survey by _ nikkei media marketing , inc . _ in tokyo , and are commercially available .",
    "they include the information about each firm s borrowing obtained from financial institutions such as the amounts of borrowing and their classification into short - term and long - term borrowings .",
    "we examined the period from the years 1980 to 2005 , for which incomplete data are few , and study the time development of credit relationships by using the total of long and short - term credit .    for financial institutions , we select commercial banks as a set of leading suppliers of credit .",

    "any of them would result in the banks financial deterioration , the level of which was assumed to be quantified by @xmath38 at the outset of our argument .",
    "such influence to bank @xmath1 from firms is reasonably supposed to take the form , @xmath42 , in a similar way ( see fig .  [",

    "it then follows that @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 is its eigenvalue and @xmath47 is the corresponding eigenvector .",
    "@xmath47 is the fragility scores of banks , and @xmath48 is for firms .    mathematically , an alternative set of scores could be defined , which we call `` dual '' scores .",

    "it is assumed that the shock propagates by eq.([eq : yx ] ) to generate @xmath48 among firms , which in turn affects the banks by eq.([eq : xy ] ) .",
    "although we do not have knowledge on the time - scale for this diffusion process , it would be reasonable to assume that the structure of credit network does not change much in the meanwhile .",
    "then the propagation of the perturbation , going back and forth from banks to themselves , could be described by the repetition of eq.([eq : yx ] ) and eq.([eq : xy ] ) , or equivalently , @xmath63 for a finite number of iterations @xmath64 .",
    "suppose that the eigenvalues are sorted in the decreasing order : @xmath65 the subspace spanned by the trivial eigenvector @xmath66 should be ignored in the consideration of perturbation , since it merely represents a constant mode .",

    ", it is suggested that one should consider only a few largest eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "therefore , the eigen decomposition of the idiosyncratic shocks , the profile of which is not known beforehand , can tell us which eigen - modes are important in the propagation of influence from banks to firms and _ vice versa _ in a finite time - scale .",
    "one needs to evaluate which eigen - modes are significant . in order to determine the significance of @xmath71 and @xmath72",

    "3 .   randomly choose a pair of a bank - stub and a firm - stub , and rewire the pair by an edge .",
    "the 3rd procedure is done so that there is no multiple edge between any pair of bank and firm .",
    "this rewiring procedure alters the weight as @xmath73 if the edge emanating from @xmath1 to @xmath3 is randomly connected to @xmath74 .",
    "note that @xmath24 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are invariant for each @xmath1 and @xmath3 under rewiring , while @xmath25 becomes randomized .",
    "therefore , the matrix @xmath11 has the same structure except a permutation of columns .",
    "this means that a same amount of credit is supplied by a bank to a different firm in the randomly generated graphs .",
    "the sum of eigenvalues satisfies eq.([eq : lamsum ] ) . to compare the spectrum @xmath51 with that for random graphs",
    ", one has to do so after a normalization .",

    "there are a strong peak in the late 80s and a drop in 1990 ; also two peaks around 1992 and in 1997 .",
    "the relationship between banks and firms changed in the course of the japanese bubble ( speculative investment into stocks and real estate ) in the nation , notably in the late 80s up to 1990 and after the bubble ( after 1990 ) period .",
    "two points should be considered for understanding what happened in the japanese credit market during the period .",
    "first , firms were allowed to issue public debt , after financial deregulation , meaning that they were less dependent on bank loans . secondly , after the collapse of bubble",
    ", banks were left with non - performing loans , which hindered the intermediary role of banks .",
    "the problem of bad loans affected individual firm s decision to contract banks .",
    "it is known , for example , that during the bubble period the firms , especially large ones , tended to rely on a single relation , while in the period of long stagnation after the collapse of the bubble the average percentage of multiple contracts increases @xcite .",
    "banks then spent a decade or longer in 90s to recover from bad loans experiencing a financial crisis for a couple of years from 1997 . in the late of 1997 and in 1998 ,",
    "three major and other small banks failed . while two major banks were nationalized , and other political decisions were made for maintaining the stability of financial system , most banks , major and minor , decreased the supply of credit immediately ; even by reducing existing loans to firms , most notably for small and medium - sized firms .",
    "our observation in fig .",
    "[ fig : ts_lam23 ] , for the late 80s and an abrupt change in 1990 , coincides with this historical change of the bank - firm relationship .",
    "the fragility score in terms of the non - trivial eigenvalues increased during the period when firms tended to have single relation .",
    "also , in 1997 , banks decreased the total amount of loan during the 90s in attempt to reduce bad loans systematically .",
    "this can be considered to decrease the diversity in the credit system , resulting in the increase of fragility score .",
    "we also examined the components of eigenvectors , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , in order to have a look at how stable or unstable the eigen - structure is during the same period of time .",

    "here we relate the obtained results with historical description on the japanese banking system in the past 25 years .",
    "the absolute values of the eigenvectors , in fig .",
    "[ fig : bcode - eig ] , have a relatively stable profile among banks from 1980 to 1986 and from 2000 to 2005 .",

    "are present at two banks , from 1986 to 1989 , which are in the middle - north region and are known to have deteriorated financially during the period . in the late 80s to 90s",
    ", the bank of japan ( boj ) altered monetary policy tightening the policy most notably in 1990 .",
    "after the bubble collapse , during the 90s , the profile changed into another configuration . a spike in the classification of _ h _ refers to the credit associations ( shinkin banks ) .",
    "then , in the latter half of 90s , the profile went back to the previous one but with more peaks at other regional banks ( especially at secondary regional banks ) .",
    "the spikes from 2003 to 2005 correspond to three banks in okinawa .    though we need more investigation beyond the anecdotal evidence , it is intriguing to note that several of the spikes in the profiles correspond to failed banks and to banks that had been merged into larger banks .",
    "also we note that the peaks and spikes mentioned above are present in same geographical regions  middle and north regions , and okinawa .",
    "one of the authors",
    "( y.  f. ) with collaborators recently showed that banks can be clustered into groups according to their patterns of lending to firms @xcite . in fact , by defining the pattern for bank @xmath1 by a vector @xmath90 that is equal to a column vector of the matrix @xmath11 : @xmath91 it is possible to define a similarity in the lending patterns for a pair of banks @xmath1 and @xmath92 , for example , by the inner product of the corresponding vectors @xmath90 and @xmath93 .",
    "then one can perform the clustering by standard methods including multi - dimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed the minimum spanning tree ( mst ) calculated by a similarity measure ignoring the information of weight but considering only the connectivity from banks to firms .",
    "the resulting mst corresponds to clusters of co - financing relationships of banks , which strongly reflect the geographical regions especially for the regional banks .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate how the eigen - structure is related to those clusters .",
    "it is also remarked that , as described in section  [ sec : data ] , we did not include the firms that went into bankruptcy .",
    "it should be interesting to include them in the credit network in order to evaluate the effect to banks and to compare the evaluation with the structural change that followed after the bankruptcy",
    ". it would be possible to model such propagation based on our consideration in defining the scores .",
    "we studied the structure and its temporal change of japanese credit relationships between commercial banks and quoted firms for the 25 years from 1980 to 2005 .",
    "each snapshot of the credit network is regarded as a weighted bipartite graph , where each node is either a bank or a firm , and an edge between a bank and a firm is defined to be present if there is a credit relationship between them .",
    "the edge has a weight that represents the amount of credit .",
    "suppose that a bank shrinks the amount of its supplied credit , a firm as debtor would be influenced to a certain extent that might be quantified by a matrix that can be calculated by the weight .",
    "similarly , if a firm fails , then its effect to a bank as debtor would propagate to an extent that is measurable from the weight . to quantify the propagation",
    ", we introduced a set of score named fragility and its dual , and proved mathematical properties among them .",
    "the set of scores can be obtained by solving an eigenvalue problem .    by comparing the eigen - structure",
    "with that obtained in random bipartite graphs , which have same distributions for degrees of banks and firms and for normalized weight of banks , we found that the largest few ( non - trivial ) eigenvalues for the scores are significant .",
    "we performed historical analysis for our datasets , and showed that there are periods when the eigen - structure is stable or unstable , and that a particular set of banks , mostly a few regional banks , have large values of the fragility scores .",
    "drastic change occurs in the late 80s during the bubble and also at the epochs of financially unstable periods including the financial crisis .",
    "further investigation might be necessary to relate our results based on complex network analysis to the characteristic of banks , but we believe that our approach is a potentially valuable quantification of the structure and its temporal change of credit relationships .",
    "as shown in section  [ sec : nw_frag ] , the set @xmath47 of fragility scores of banks is the right eigenvector of the weight matrix @xmath58 as in eq.([eq : eigx ] ) , and the set @xmath59 of dual scores of banks satisfy the left eigenvector of @xmath58 as in eq.([eq : eigu ] ) . in this appendix",
    ", we prove mathematical properties on eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "let us first show that the score @xmath59 can be calculated directly from the score @xmath47 .",
    "eq.([eq : eigx ] ) is written explicitly in components as @xmath94 which we rewrite as @xmath95 on the other hand , eq.([eq : eigu ] ) is @xmath96 which , after exchanging @xmath97 , reads as @xmath98 by comparing eq.([eq : eigxc ] ) and eq.([eq : eiguc ] ) , we find that they are equivalent under the identification : @xmath99 this also proves that left - eigenvalues and the right - eigenvalues have a same spectrum .",
    "let us consider two sets of eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors , + @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we have @xmath102 this means that @xmath103 which , by the use of eq.([eq : xu ] ) , implies that @xmath104 therefore , the eigenvectors should be orthonormal under the weight @xmath24 as a metric is a covariant vector , @xmath59 is a contravariant vector , and the metric that connects them is given by @xmath105 .",
    "the orthogonalization of eigenvectors is done with respect to this metric . ] .",
    "that is , @xmath106 it follows from eq.([eq : ortx ] ) the orthonormality : @xmath107    this consideration of the inner product implies that we should take a look at the product of eq.([eq : eigxc ] ) and @xmath38 .",
    "this leads us to @xmath108 this proves that @xmath51 is real and positive , although the matrix @xmath58 is not symmetric .",
    "also we have the following inequality that holds for any value of @xmath109 .",
    "@xmath110 this leads to the inequality for the discriminant : @xmath111 from which it proves that the largest eigenvalue is 1 .",
    "@xmath112 this proves eq.([eq : spectrum ] ) .",
    "it is obvious from eq.([eq : lamtmp ] ) that @xmath113 if and only if @xmath114 . in fact , one can easily see , from eq.([eq : sum_a ] ) and eq.([eq : sum_b ] ) that @xmath115 ( @xmath2 ) is the eigenvector corresponding to @xmath113 , provided that the bipartite graph is connected ( i.e. any node of bank or firm is reachable from any other ) is constant in each connected components .",
    "the multiplicity of @xmath113 is equal to the number of the connected components . ] .",
    "this proves eq.([eq : trivia ] ) .",
    "in addition , by applying the orthogonal relation in eq.([eq : ortx2 ] ) to eq.([eq : eigxc ] ) , it can be shown after a short calculation that the summation formula holds : @xmath116 this proves eq.([eq : lamsum ] ) .    to summarize",
    ", the eigenvector @xmath59 can be calculated directly from the eigenvector @xmath47 .",
    "also the eigenvalues satisfy @xmath117 , where the largest eigenvalue corresponds to a trivial eigenvector .    on the other hand , the dual scores , @xmath59 , corresponding to the largest eigenvalue @xmath113 simply represents the total amount of loans , namely @xmath118 due to eq.([eq : xu ] ) , so we can focus on non - trivial eigenvectors , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and so on in the main text ."
