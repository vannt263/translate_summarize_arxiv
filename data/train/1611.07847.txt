    "according to the standard theory of neutrino oscillations ( see e.g.  @xcite for an updated review and relevant references ) , the observed neutrino flavours @xmath7 are a superposition of the massive eigenstates @xmath8 : @xmath9 where the index @xmath10 can be any of the three active neutrino flavours @xmath11 , the index @xmath2 runs over the three massive eigenstates and @xmath12 is the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata mixing matrix , containing the neutrino mixing angles as well as the cp violating phases ( one dirac phase , as well as two additional majorana phases , that are non vanishing only if neutrinos are majorana particles ) .",
    "cosmological measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( hereafter cmb ) anisotropies and of the spatial distribution of galaxies provide the tightest bounds on the total neutrino mass , defined as the sum of the three neutrino mass eigenstates , i.e. @xmath13 .",
    "the most reliable bound that can be obtained combining planck data with external datasets is @xmath14  ev ( at 95% cl )  @xcite , from temperature plus large - scale polarization cmb anisotropies and baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) data ( see also refs  @xcite for constraints obtained by the combination of additional datasets and/or in more extended cosmological scenarios ) . from neutrino oscillation data , we know that at least two out of the three mass eigenstates should be massive , as two different mass splittings are measured with percent accuracy by current experiments : the solar @xmath15 and the atmospheric @xmath16 : the normal hierarchy ( nh hereafter ) , in which the atmospheric gap is positive , and corresponds to @xmath17 , and the inverted hierarchy ( ih in what follows ) , in which the atmospheric gap is negative , and corresponds to @xmath18   a small region of the ih scenario , for some particular ranges of the mixing parameters . however , a large fraction of the ih region is still allowed .",
    "antineutrino data can shed light on these results , see http://nusoft.fnal.gov/nova/results/index.html  @xcite . ] . assuming that the mass of the lightest mass eigenstate is zero , which equals to set to zero the mass of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) in the nh ( ih ) , it is possible to obtain a lower bound on the sum of neutrino masses of @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) from neutrino oscillation measurements .",
    "neutrino mixing phenomena are sensitive to the neutrino mass splittings only , not to the individual neutrino masses nor to the overall mass scale .",
    "cosmology provides one of the most suitable places where to test and extract the neutrino mass ordering  @xcite , see also the recent work of refs .  @xcite . despite the fact that current bounds on the neutrino mass @xmath0 show a dependence on how the mass is distributed among the three mass eigenstates  @xcite , present cosmological measurements are not able to firmly single out nature s choice for the mass hierarchy .",
    "consequently , in the absence of a robust measurement of the neutrino mass ordering , a desirable bound on @xmath0 would be one which does not rely on any assumption ( or , to be more precise : that relies on the less informative possible assumption ) about the hierarchical distribution of the total mass among the three eigenstates .",
    "this kind of problem , where the distribution of the parameters of the model under scrutiny are themselves conditionally dependent on the so - called _ hyperparameters _ ( namely , the bounds on @xmath0 are extracted by assuming a specific mass splitting ) , is a typical example of a hierarchical model in statistical inference . in this work ,",
    "we propose a novel method to get a hierarchy - independent bound on @xmath0 , by means of a new discrete parameter , the , @xmath4 ( that can in practice be identified with the sign of the atmospheric mass splitting ) , introduced in the standard monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) analysis .",
    "this innovative strategy benefits from the fact that the sensitivity to the neutrino hierarchy is simply and unbiasedly extracted from the posterior probability distribution of @xmath4 .",
    "we shall add this parameter while analyzing current and future cosmological data , to illustrate the power of this technique .",
    "we stress that our approach is different from the one , already found in the literature , in which a single , continuous parameter is used to parametrize both the sum of neutrino masses and the hierarchy @xcite .",
    "the drawback of the approach proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , when used in an mcmc framework , is that it is not possible to disentangle the prior assumptions on the individual masses and on the hierarchy ; in particular , a flat ( uninformative ) prior on the hierarchy implies a non - flat prior on the mass . in our approach",
    ", we are free to specify noninformative priors for both the hierarchy and the mass of the lightest eigenstate .",
    "apart from cosmological probes , there also exist laboratory avenues which are sensitive to the absolute mass scale . in this context ,",
    "neutrinoless double @xmath23 decay ( @xmath24 ) searches ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) are intriguing , as a positive signal would guarantee that neutrinos have a non - zero majorana mass @xcite .",
    "double beta decay is a rare spontaneous nuclear transition in which the charge of two isobaric nuclei changes by two units , emitting two electrons .",
    "the dominant mode of this decay also produces two electron antineutrinos , conserving lepton number and therefore , it is allowed in the standard model framework .",
    "double @xmath23 decay without antineutrino emission , violating lepton number by two units , is the neutrinoless double @xmath23 decay . planned @xmath24 experiments might have the required sensitivity to completely cover the region of the parameter space where a positive signal is expected in the case of ih distribution of the total neutrino mass .",
    "robust limits on the total neutrino mass coming from cosmology can further reduce the allowed region of the parameter space where to look for @xmath24 events .",

    "the problem we deal with in this work is a typical example of a statistically hierarchical model ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a key feature of hierarchical problems is that the parameters @xmath25 of the model introduced for constraining the observables through the data @xmath26 are modeled conditionally on further parameters , the _ hyperparameters _",
    "@xmath27 , which have themselves their own prior probability distribution @xmath28 . as a result",
    ", we can define a joint prior distribution @xmath29 so that the proper posterior distribution @xmath30 of the parameters ( both `` normal '' and `` hyper '' ) can be written , using bayes theorem , as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the likelihood function , in which we dropped the explicit dependence on @xmath27 , since the data depends on @xmath27 only through @xmath25 , and @xmath33 is the model evidence , or marginal likelihood .",
    "the latter does not depend on the parameters , and thus represents just a multiplicative constant as long as parameter estimation is concerned .    in the case under investigation in this work ,",
    "the model parameters are extracted conditionally on the choice of the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "this choice is modelled by introducing a discrete hyperparameter @xmath4 that can take two values , corresponding to nh and ih ( i.e to @xmath34 or @xmath35 , respectively ) .",
    "since little is known from current experiments about the preference for one of the two neutrino hierarchies , either normal or inverted , we assign equal _ a priori _ probability to the two possible outcomes that @xmath4 could take .    we therefore perform a mcmc analysis of an eight - dimensional parameter space .",
    "we consider the usual set of six cosmological parameters in the @xmath36 scenario , namely the baryon density @xmath37 , the cold dark matter density @xmath38 , the angular size of the sound horizon @xmath39 , the reionization optical depth @xmath40 , the scalar spectral index @xmath41 and the amplitude @xmath42}$ ] of the power spectrum of primordial scalar perturbations normalized at the pivot scale @xmath43 .",
    "all these parameters are extracted from flat prior distributions .",
    "the inclusion of massive neutrinos is perfomed in the following way : we assume three massive non - degenerate eigenstates sharing the same temperature @xmath44 .",

    "this is the reason why the lightest eigenstate corresponds to @xmath19 in the nh scenario , while it is mapped onto @xmath20 in the ih scenario .",
    "we use the latest best - fit values for the oscillation mass gaps  @xcite .",
    "as anticipated at the beginning of this section , the choice of the hierarchy is addressed via the discrete @xmath4 , which is the eight parameter of the model . at each step , we extract @xmath4 from @xmath51 , assigning equal _ a priori _ probability to the two hierarchical scenarios ( i.e. , we use the discrete equivalent of a flat prior ) . in the formalism sketched at the beginning of the section , @xmath52},\\,m_\\mathrm{light})$ ] , while @xmath53 .",
    "the inclusion of the allows us to handle our ignorance about the true hierarchical distribution of the mass as a nuisance parameter , to be marginalized over . in this way",
    ", the posterior distribution of @xmath4 for a given datasets contains information about the preference for one of the two hierarchies from that dataset .",

    "we quote our results in terms of 95% credible intervals for the parameters . given that we will be dealing with possibly multimodal distributions",
    ", the credible intervals can consist of the union of disjointed regions .",
    "current cmb and bao measurements are considered .",
    "results are presented separately for cmb temperature and low - multipole polarization data ( the former ranging from multipoles @xmath58 up to @xmath59 ) from the planck mission ( tt + lowp ) , and for the addition , to the previous measurements , of the high multipole ( i.e. small - scale ) polarization and cross - correlation spectra , i.e. the full planck data release ( tt , te , ee + lowp ) , see refs .",
    "we remind the reader that since , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , small - scale polarization data could still be affected by low - level residual systematics , results obtained without using them should be regarded as more reliable .",

    "the combination of these measurements will be referred to as bao .",
    "the addition of galaxy clustering measurements , apart from breaking pure _ geometrical _ degeneracies among different cosmological parameters ( as , for instance , the one existing between the hubble constant @xmath68 and the neutrino mass @xmath0  @xcite ) , also helps enormously in pining down the neutrino mass limits , as the free streaming nature of sub - ev neutrinos will leave a clear imprint in the galaxy power spectrum at scales in the regime of interest , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we also perform forecasts for future cmb and galaxy clustering data . for the fiducial values of the six @xmath69cdm parameters , we use the mean values of the estimates reported in @xcite for plancktt+simlow .",
    "concerning cmb measurements , we consider a future core - like  @xcite satellite mission , generating mock lensed temperature and polarization data accordingly to refs .",
    "we assume perfect foreground subtraction as well as precise control of systematics .",
    "the expected noise spectra ( which relies on specific experimental setup , such as the sky fraction , the beam width , and the temperature and polarization sensitivities ) has been verified against previous results in the literature  @xcite , finding an excellent agreement .",
    "future galaxy clustering data are added by means of the expected independent observations of the bao signal along and across the line of sight from the dark energy instrument ( desi ) experiment  @xcite .",
    "desi observations will provide separate measurements of @xmath70 and @xmath71 at a number of redshifts .",
    "this survey is expected to cover @xmath72 squared degrees of the sky in the redshift range @xmath73 .",

    "furthermore , we include , in the future cosmological data , a @xmath76-measurement of the hubble constant @xmath68 .",
    "this is implemented in the form of a gaussian prior on @xmath68 in the analysis with future cosmological data .",
    "however , given the fact that the core sensitivity is such that it will expectedly allow to determine the value of @xmath68 below that precision , such a prior on the hubble constant does not play any crucial role .",

    ", we report the results for @xmath4 , in the form ( odds for nh : odds ih ) .",
    "the odds shown in the second column of table  [ tab : current ] show how cmb temperature data alone are not sensitive to the different mass parameterizations .",
    "this is due to the broad bound that the cmb temperature data set on the total neutrino mass , @xmath80  ev at @xmath77  cl .",
    "in fact , the potential for cosmological observations to discriminate between the two mass orderings mainly relies on the capability to push the upper limit on @xmath0 close or even below @xmath81  ev , the minimal value of the mass allowed by oscillation data in the case of ih .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the region @xmath82 is only allowed in the case of normal hierarchy , so that tighter upper bounds on @xmath0 end up favouring the nh scenario simply because of the larger volume in parameter space available to the model .",
    "moreover , the region of masses with @xmath83 is the one where the mass patterns predicted by nh and ih , and the resulting cosmological perturbations , differ the most .",
    "the differences are however small , given the sensitivity of present , and possibly also future , experiments , and the dominant contribution to the constraining power still comes from the sheer amount of volume in parameter space available to the two models . on the opposite ,",
    "when @xmath84 ( i.e. , @xmath85 ) , we are in a situation in which both hierarchies effectively coincide with the degenerate scenario @xmath86 , and the differences in the evolution of perturbations induced by the mass ordering are too small to have any observable consequence , given current sensitivities . given that the we find a bound from cmb temperature anisotropies and large - scale polarization @xmath80  ev , most of the parameter space available , given this data , is in the `` effectively degenerate '' region , where the two hierarchies can not be distinguished . indeed , the posterior distributions for the mass fractions @xmath87 for the case of cmb temperature data are clearly peaking on @xmath88 , as it would be in the fully degenerate scenario .",
    "notice that the addition of small - scale cmb polarization measurements slightly improves the neutrino mass bound ( @xmath89  ev at @xmath77  cl ) but it does not change significantly the overall picture .    we note that the bounds we find seems to be larger , when a direct comparison is possible , than those found in ref .",
    "@xcite without the marginalization over the two possible mass orderings : compare , e.g. , our bound @xmath80  ev with @xmath90 , the 95% upper bound from planck tt+lowp in the context of the @xmath91 model , assuming three massive degenerate neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "the reason is the following . in the present analysis , a non - vanishing lower bound on the total neutrino mass ,",
    "@xmath92 is naturally imposed by taking into account neutrino oscillation measurements , while in ref .",
    "@xcite it is only assumed that @xmath93 . as a consequence , in our case",
    "the 95% confidence regions for @xmath0 are shifted , by definition , towards larger masses .",
    "the same care should be applied when comparing to similar constraints reported in the literature .",
    "the inclusion of bao measurements results in much tighter neutrino mass bounds than those obtained with cmb data only .",
    "the combination of the cosmological data then starts to be sensitive to the region of @xmath94 in which the nh and the ih scenarios correspond to different neutrino mass spectra .",
    "this can be clearly noticed from the bimodal distributions in both @xmath0 and in the neutrino mass fractions depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : current ] , where two distinct peaks appear , each one being associated to the most probable value of the parameter _ for a given choice of the hierarchy_. in fact , focusing on @xmath0 , we find that the most probable value is @xmath95 , but a second peak is also clearly visible in @xmath96 .",
    "these peaks are associated to the ( single ) peak at @xmath97 in the posterior for the mass of the lightest neutrino , that gets mapped to two distinct values of @xmath0 depending on the hierarchy .    by focusing on the one - dimensional distribution of the _ hyperparameter _",
    "@xmath4 , one might be able to assess whether current cosmological data favour one of the two hierarchical scenarios and to what extent . after the inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : current ] , upper panel , we can conclude that while there is still not compelling evidence for the cosmological data to prefer one of the two scenarios , the combination of cmb and bao slightly favors the nh scheme ( 4:3 odds in favor of nh , without using small - scale polarization , or 3:2 if we use it ) .",
    "finally , we note that the mean values and errors of the standard @xmath36 parameters @xmath98 , @xmath68 and @xmath99 shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : current ] are indeed very close to those quoted in ref .",

    "this is yet another reflection of the fact that in the most part of the high - probability region of the parameter space , the mass spectrum is effectively degenerate .    to conclude this section , current cosmological data are only mildly sensitive to the neutrino mass ordering , with a preference of 4:3 in favour of nh from the combination of planck cmb data and bao measurements",
    "in this section , we present forecasted constraints from future cosmological surveys on the neutrino mass parameters and discuss whether the improved sensitivity of the next - generation cosmological observatories will help unraveling the dilemma about the neutrino mass ordering .",
    "we present the results for the forecasted core - like  @xcite cmb mission and a desi - like survey  @xcite in tab .  [",

    "[ fig : futuref ] .",
    "the results are quoted following the same scheme adopted in tab .",
    "[ tab : current ] and detailed at the beginning of sec .",
    "[ sec : current ] . we have considered three possible fiducial scenarios : two nh schemes , one with @xmath5 and the other one with @xmath100 , and one ih scenario , also with @xmath100 .",
    "notice that even for a future cmb mission as core it will be very difficult to extract with high statistical significance the neutrino mass hierarchy in any of the three fiducial scenarios explored here , even in the case of @xmath101 ( @xmath5 ) . nevertheless , by a comparison between the results in tabs .",
    "[ tab : current ] and those in tab .",
    "[ tab : future ] one can learn that the expected sensitivity of core alone on the neutrino mass measurements is slightly better than current combined cmb and galaxy clustering searches .",
    "this accuracy could be reinforced , for instance , by improved measurements from low - redshift experiments , such as adding a prior on the hubble constant which simulates a @xmath102-measurement of @xmath68 .",
    "however , the impact of such a constraint will be almost negligible , as the core mission alone reaches already that precision in @xmath68 .",
    "we therefore focus on additional information coming from galaxy surveys and add future forecasted measurements of the hubble parameters and of the angular diameter distance from the desi survey  @xcite .",
    "adding bao measurements improves considerably the results for the fiducial model with @xmath5 ; in this case , we find a @xmath103 preference of nh versus ih .",
    "the great improvement due to the addition of desi bao data when @xmath5 can be clearly visualized from the first two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : futuref ] : notice that the second peak at @xmath104 in the @xmath0 posterior is significantly reduced after the inclusion of bao data .    on the contrary , for the @xmath100 case , the situation is dramatically different .",
    "in fact , even if the addition of bao measurements helps at pinpointing the value of sum of neutrino masses ( as it can be seen by comparing , in fig .  [",
    "fig : futuref ] , the width of the dashed black and blue curves with that of their solid counterparts ) , nevertheless the data still remain completely uninformative for what concerns the mass splitting , as it can be inferred by looking at the numbers reported in the last row of tab .",
    "[ tab : future ] , second and third columns .",
    "this points to the fact that , as already explained in sec .",
    "ii in reference to current experiments , the capability of future cmb and bao observations to discriminate the neutrino mass hierarchy mainly relies on volume effects , i.e. , on the possibility of excluding @xmath105 with a high statistical significance ; this is the case for the fiducial model with @xmath106 .",
    "when instead @xmath107 ( or larger ) , as in the other two fiducial models considered here , the two mass orderings should be disentangled through the effect of the individual neutrino masses on the evolution of cosmological perturbations .",
    "our findings clearly indicate that this is beyond the reach of next - generation cmb and bao experiments , even in the most optimistic case ( for @xmath108 , the differences between the two hierarchies are even smaller ) .",

    "( [ eq : thalf])-([eq : mbb ] ) , and are thus crucial for @xmath24 experiments .",

    "in this situation the hierarchy could be extracted by neutrinoless double beta decay itself , since a positive signal characterized by @xmath133 would suggest an ih scenario . alternatively , a positive signal characterized by @xmath134 plus the expected sensitivity of @xmath135 would point to a nh scenario and discard the ih scenario with high statistical significance .    if , on the other hand , @xmath0 is closer to the minimal value allowed in the nh scenario , the sensitivity of future neutrinoless double beta decay searches may not be enough to detect the putative signal from majorana neutrinos , due to the possible disruptive interference played by oscillation parameters in the definition of the majorana mass . nevertheless , in that case",
    ", future cosmological data can single out the neutrino mass ordering with high significance .",
    "we have presented constraints on cosmological parameters in the context of a @xmath91 scenario , with @xmath0 representing the sum of neutrino masses , assuming three massive non - degenerate eigenstates and properly taking into account the neutrino mass ordering .",

    "this approach allows as to _",
    "( i ) _ model the exact mass splittings without making use of approximations , and including the information from oscillation measurements ; _ ( ii ) _ to quantitatively assess the preference for one of the two hierarchies in a straightforward fashion , without the need for computing the bayesian evidence for performing model comparison , and _ ( iii ) _ to account for the incomplete knowledge of the neutrino hierarchy that could potentially affect the neutrino mass bounds .",
    "we have employed current cosmological data coming fom the planck satellite measurements of the cmb anisotropies and a compilation of bao measurements at different redshifts .",
    "we have also performed forecasts for future cosmological missions , such as the proposed cmb satellite mission core and the future galaxy survey desi .",
    "focusing on current cosmological measurements , we have shown that cmb temperature and polarization data alone are not sensitive enough to discriminate between the two hierarchies . when bao information is included , present",
    "cosmological probes start to be weakly sensitive to the mass ordering ( @xmath136 or @xmath137 odds in favor of nh , with or without cmb small - scale polarization , respectively ) , although compelling evidence for one of the two is still lacking .",
    "marginalizing over the hierarchy parameter slightly worsens the neutrino mass limits , albeit galaxy clustering data in the form of bao measurements lead to results very similar to those obtained in the absence of the _ hyperparameter _ @xmath4 .",
    "concerning future experiments , their combination turns out to be really powerful , as it will lead to a @xmath103 preference for the normal hierarchy scenario versus the inverted hierarchy one , assuming a fiducial cosmology with a sum of neutrino masses @xmath5 .",
    "however , for larger masses @xmath100 distinguishing the hierarchy via cosmological measurements alone turns out to be an extremely difficult task . adding other possible future improvements , as , for instance",
    ", a @xmath76 prior in the value of the hubble constant , will not change significantly the results , since the core mission is expected to provide a smaller uncertainty on @xmath68 .",
    "additional constraining power might come from more precise measurements of the shape of the matter power spectrum , provided that systematics and uncertainties related to the exact modelling of the perturbation behaviour in the non - linear regime ( where we expect neutrinos to leave their most peculiar signature on the matter power spectrum ) are kept under control .",
    "we have also studied the implications and the complementarity with neutrinoless double beta decay searches .",
    "current limits from the kamland - zen experiment are competitive and consistent with the tightest cosmological limit we find here on the _ effective majorana mass _ , @xmath122 .",
    "these results imply that , if nature has chosen the inverted hierarchy scheme and the majorana neutrino character ( versus the normal hierarchy scenario and the dirac nature ) , a positive signal from neutrino neutrinoless double beta decay searches , as well as a cosmological detection of the neutrino mass , could be imminent .",
    "future prospects for neutrinoless double beta decay experiment are promising for a total neutrino mass @xmath100 , regardless of the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "however , if the lightest neutrino mass eigenstate turns out to be zero , and the hierarchy normal , the detection of this putative signal can not be guaranteed , even for an ultimate , highly sensitive neutrinoless double beta decay experiment .",
    "the good news is that if this is the case realized in nature , cosmology will be able to tell us about the neutrino mass hierarchy with compelling statistical significance .     plane , for current cosmological ( planck tt , te , ee + bao ) and neutrino oscillation data .",
    "the contours are calculated by taking into account the uncertainty on the mass ordering , without fixing a priori the mass hierarchy .",
    "two distinct contour areas , corresponding to the two mass orderings , can be identified ( even if they are not completely separated from each other ) , see text for details .",
    "the orange horizontal bands correspond to the 90% upper bounds on @xmath127 obtained from kamland - zen @xcite , for different assumptions for the values of the nuclear matrix elements that enter into the calculation of @xmath127.[fig : betabeta ] ]     plane , for current cosmological ( planck tt , te , ee + bao ) and neutrino oscillation data .",

    "<S> concerning next - generation cosmological experiments , forecasts suggest that the combination of upcoming cmb ( core ) and bao surveys ( desi ) may determine the neutrino mass hierarchy at a high statistical significance if the mass is very close to the minimal value allowed by oscillation experiments , as for nh and a fiducial value of @xmath5 there is a 9:1 preference of normal versus inverted hierarchy . on the contrary , </S>",
