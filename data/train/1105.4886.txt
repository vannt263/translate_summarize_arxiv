    "quantum magnetism is one of the most intriguing areas in condensed - matter physics .",
    "even though the attempts to understand it root back to the early days of quantum theory , still there are many open questions even at the level of the minimalistic hubbard model @xcite .",
    "many theoretical and experimental efforts have been devoted to revealing the mechanisms behind magnetic ordering of many - body systems @xcite .",
    "due to the high level of complexity in solid - state systems , a quantitative comparison between theory and experiment seems a very challenging task , if not impossible at all .",
    "therefore it is highly desirable to work with systems which are able to _ simulate _ the original solid - state many - body systems , but in a much more controllable way .    over the past decade cold - atomic quantum gases in optical lattices",
    "have provided an excellent laboratory for investigating many - body quantum systems with an unprecedented level of precision and control .",
    "nowadays one can routinely create optical lattices with different geometries that mimic solid - state crystalline structures and then load different quantum gases into them , playing the role of electrons . based on this experimental progress , fundamental many - body phenomena such as the mott insulator quantum phase transition of interacting bosons",
    "have been realized @xcite . for bosonic gases in optical lattices",
    "correlated atom tunneling @xcite and superexchange due to second - order atom tunneling @xcite have been observed , which are the basic mechanisms leading to quantum magnetism . at the current stage , detecting anti - ferromagnetic long - range ordering of spinful fermions or bosons is arguably the most challenging goal and there are large experimental and theoretical efforts directed towards reaching this phase .",
    "this may eventually give insights into the mechanism of high-@xmath0 superconductivity as well @xcite .",
    "the recently developed optical quantum gas microscope @xcite offers the possibility to detect quantum magnetism on the single - atom level , and has been utilized to observe the phase transition of a one - dimensional chain of interacting ising spins by using a mott insulator of spinless bosons in a tilted optical lattice @xcite .    in parallel to these experimental developments , there are several theoretical proposals how to gain fundamental insight into quantum magnetism via ultracold gases @xcite .",
    "one of the aims has been to realize a spin hamiltonian by interacting ultracold bosons @xcite . for this two - component bose gas in an optical lattice , which is effectively described by the bose - hubbard model , the complete phase diagram was mapped out by a variational approach @xcite .",
    "a related important experimental achievement is given by mixtures of different quantum gases , whether with different statistics ( bose - fermi mixture ) or different isotopes of the same type ( bose - bose or fermi - fermi mixture ) . recently a bose - bose mixture of @xmath1rb and @xmath2k in a 3d optical lattice has been realized @xcite .",
    "here it is possible to tune independently the inter - species and intra - species interactions . in",
    "a follow - up experiment the same bose - bose mixture has been used to investigate the entropy exchange between two spin - dependent traps though without lattice @xcite .",
    "another bose - bose mixture , made of two hyperfine states of @xmath1rb , has served as a spin gradient thermometer which allows to measure the temperature of ultra - cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite . in a further experiment",
    "the effect of the bose - bose inter - species interaction on the bosonic superfluidity of one of the components in a 3d optical lattice has been explored @xcite .    motivated by these experiments , here we theoretically investigate a two - component bose gas in 2d and 3d optical lattices .",
    "this system can be effectively modeled by the bose - hubbard model .",
    "we will specifically consider the case of filling @xmath3 and @xmath4 per site .",
    "we investigate the homogeneous ( untrapped ) system by means of bosonic dynamical mean - field theory ( bdmft ) @xcite and the harmonically trapped case by its real - space generalization ( rbdmft ) , which extends the original bdmft formalism to the study of inhomogeneous systems .",
    "dmft has been established as a powerful tool for strongly - correlated fermionic systems @xcite , while bdmft has recently been shown to provide a qualitatively and in 3d even quantitatively accurate picture of the bose - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "for the homogeneous system , we extend our previous bdmft analysis to higher filling @xmath4 and a different set of interaction parameters motivated by experiments .",
    "we map out the phase diagram and obtain diverse phases such as superfluid , unordered mott state and xy - ferromagnetic order .",
    "in addition we turn to the inhomogeneous ( trapped ) bose - hubbard model which is more closely related to the experimental situation .",
    "we include the effect of the external confining potential by rbdmft , which assumes site - dependent self - energies . in parallel",
    "we perform also a complementary calculation based on a local density approximation ( lda ) combined with bdmft which is computationally more affordable . comparing results of both methods , we examine the magnetic properties of the system for a wide range of parameters . to our best knowledge",
    "this is the first systematic and non - perturbative study of the magnetic properties of a two - component inhomogeneous bose - hubbard model .",
    "it will bring more insight into ongoing experiments on bose - bose mixtures in optical lattices .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we give a detailed description of the rbdmft approach .",
    "section iii covers our results for the homogeneous bose - hubbard model . in section",
    "iv we consider the trapped system and present results by rbdmft and lda+bdmft .",
    "we summarize with a discussion in section v.",
    "we consider a two - component bosonic mixture in an optical lattice with either 2d square or 3d cubic geometry .",
    "experimentally the bose - bose mixture could consist of two different species , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath1rb and @xmath2k as in ref .",
    "@xcite or two different hyperfine states of a single species , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath1rb as in refs .",

    "@xmath17 denotes the inter- and intra - species interactions , which can be tuned via a feshbach resonance or by spin - dependent lattices .",
    "@xmath18 denotes the global chemical potential for the two bosonic species and @xmath19 the harmonic trap .    for the fermionic hubbard model",
    ", dmft has been developed and implemented successfully @xcite as a non - perturbative formalism to study strongly - correlated electronic systems .",
    "this includes real - space generalizations of dmft to address inhomogeneous fermionic systems @xcite . in spite of this success , a bosonic version of dmft ( bdmft ) for",
    "the bose - hubbard model has been formulated @xcite and implemented @xcite only very recently .",
    "inspired by the case of fermions , here we extend bdmft @xcite to a real - space bdmft ( rbdmft ) formalism for inhomogeneous systems to include also the harmonic trap which is crucial in the experiments .",
    "rbdmft is capable of providing an accurate and non - perturbative description of the ground - state of the inhomogeneous bose - hubbard model ( [ hamil ] ) . like fermionic dmft",
    ", also bdmft assumes that the self - energy of the system is local .",
    "however , in an inhomogeneous system it depends on the lattice site , _ i.e. _ @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a kronecker delta .    in a more formal language",
    ", first we map the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) onto a set of individual single - site problems each of which is described by a _ local _ effective action @xmath22 where @xmath11 is the index of the lattice site . in this equation @xmath23",
    "is imaginary time and the function @xmath24 is a local non - interacting propagator interpreted as a _ local _ dynamical weiss mean - field and is determined in a self - consistent manner .",
    "here we use the nambu notation @xmath25 . moreover the static bosonic mean - fields are defined in terms of the bosonic operator @xmath26 as @xmath27 the index 0 indicates that all averages are taken for the cavity system _ i.e. _ excluding the impurity site . now",
    "each of the local actions can be treated as an impurity in the presence of a bath ( representing the influence of the rest of the lattice ) and therefore captured via an anderson impurity hamiltonian .",
    "there are several techniques to solve the impurity model . here",
    "we apply exact diagonalization ( ed ) @xcite .    in practice , we start with an initial set of local weiss green s functions and local bosonic superfluid order parameters @xmath28 . after solving the action ( [ action ] ) , we obtain a set of local self - energies @xmath29 with @xmath30 being matsubara frequency .",
    "then we employ the dyson equation in real - space representation in order to compute the interacting lattice green s function @xmath31 the site - dependence of the green s functions is shown by boldface quantities that denote a matrix form with site - indexed elements . here",
    "@xmath32 stands for the non - interacting green s function @xmath33 in this expression , the matrix elements @xmath34 are hopping amplitudes for a given lattice structure and the external potential is included via @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 being the distance from the trap center .",
    "eventually the self - consistency loop is closed by specifying the weiss green s function via the local dyson equation @xmath38 where the diagonal elements of the lattice green s function yield the interacting local green s function @xmath39 .",
    "this self - consistency loop is repeated until the desired accuracy for superfluid order parameters and weiss green function is obtained .",
    "complementary to rbdmft , in this work we employ an lda approach combined with single - site bdmft to explore the physics of the model ( [ hamil ] ) . here",
    "we adjust the chemical potential on each lattice site according to lda as @xmath40 .",
    "the advantage of this approach is the larger system size accessible .",
    "we validate it by comparison with the more rigorous rbdmft approach . in this paper",
    ", we apply rbdmft for 2d lattices and lda+bdmft both for 2d and 3d lattices .",
    "we start by exploring the two - component bose - hubbard model in the homogeneous case .",
    "we consider a 3d cubic lattice and focus on the situation of total filling @xmath41 being @xmath3 and @xmath4 with balanced densities @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "for each filling , we calculate both zero and finite temperature phase diagrams .",
    "we focus on the interaction regime where the inter - species interactions , @xmath44 , and intra - species interaction , @xmath45 , are just slightly different , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath46",
    ". this particular regime of interactions is accessible by feshbach resonances , and indeed our choice is motivated by a recent experiment at mit @xcite , where a sample of @xmath1rb atoms in hyperfine states @xmath47 and @xmath48 with nearly equal inter- and intra - species interactions has been prepared .",
    "the selection of interactions ( @xmath45 slightly smaller than @xmath49 ) is due to more novel magnetic phases appearing in this regime @xcite . in all our calculations we set @xmath50 as the unit of energy , and",
    "@xmath51 is the number of the nearest neighbors for each site .",
    "[ fig1new ] displays the zero and finite temperature phase diagrams of the system with a total filling of one particle per site , @xmath3 . at @xmath52 ( upper panel )",
    "we find three distinct phases which are characterized according to the value of the superfluid order parameters @xmath53 and the two - body correlator @xmath54 which indicates the xy - ferromagnetic spin - ordering .",
    "when both species have comparably large hopping , we find a superfluid phase characterized by @xmath55 .",
    "instead when the hopping amplitudes are very different , the species with larger hopping is more easily delocalized and therefore superfluid , while the other component favors a mott insulating phase . in this parameter regime , we do not find a homogeneous converged bdmft solution where each component has the same filling , which indicates phase separation between the superfluid and the mott insulator .",
    "we notice that the phase diagram is symmetric upon particle interchange and this symmetry is also manifested in the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) .",
    "the third phase emerges when the hopping amplitudes are small .",
    "this non - superfluid ( _ i.e _ mott insulating ) phase possesses an xy - ferromagnetic spin - ordering and is characterized by @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",

    "we observe that the superfluid remains robust against small finite @xmath60 . on the other hand ,",
    "the xy - ferromagnetic spin - ordered phase is sensitive to finite temperature since it is formed in the low - hopping regime and therefore easily destroyed by thermal fluctuations . at finite @xmath60",
    "this ordered phase is reduced in favor of developing a non - magnetically ordered mott state which is characterized by @xmath61 and @xmath56 and which we denote as unordered insulator@xmath62 in the following .",

    "finally for a very large difference in the hopping of the two species we observe a small window of a super - solid phase with @xmath73 and @xmath74 if @xmath75 , and vice versa .    to investigate in detail the quantum phase transition into the xy - ferromagnetically ordered state , for @xmath4 and at @xmath52 , in fig .",

    "[ fig13 ] ( top panel ) we show the particle densities , superfluid order parameters and the correlator @xmath76 at @xmath52 ( top panel ) and at finite @xmath60 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "for @xmath52 we observe a wedding - cake structure of the atomic densities _",
    "i.e. _ two plateaus of @xmath3 and @xmath4 and intermediate areas with non - integer filling .",
    "however we are more interested in the magnetic properties which are revealed by the correlator @xmath76 .",
    "we observe that in the @xmath4 domain , there is a xy - ferromagnetic phase , manifested by a finite value of @xmath76 and vanishing superfluid order parameters . in the intermediate area @xmath102",
    ", we obtain a superfluid phase with both @xmath78 and @xmath79 being finite . note that the onset of superfluidity leads to non - zero xy - ferromagnetic correlations as well . by approaching the second mott plateau with @xmath3 ,",
    "the superfluid order parameters vanish again and we obtain a non - zero value for @xmath76 , indicating once again an insulating xy - ferromagnet . finally for @xmath108 we find a further superfluid domain .    as in the previous section , we are interested in the effect of temperature on magnetic order .",
    "[ fig13 ] ( bottom panel ) represents the correlator @xmath76 for different temperatures .",
    "first we notice that for all the temperatures considered here , the correlator possesses a larger value at @xmath4 compared to @xmath3 .",
    "in other words , xy - ferromagnetic order is more pronounced for @xmath4 compared to @xmath3 as long as all other parameters of the bose - hubbard model are identical . to make this point more clear",
    ", we calculate the critical temperature for ferromagnetic order for both @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and find respectively @xmath109 ( @xmath110 pk ) and @xmath111 ( @xmath112 nk ) .",
    "we also calculate the maximum value of the critical temperature for xy - ferromagnetic order at filling @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and find that the maximum value of the critical temperature is around 200 pk and 230 pk , respectively , when the 3d cubic lattice is formed by laser beams of wave - length @xmath113 nm and the scattering length is around @xmath114 ( @xmath115 is the bohr radius )",
    ". this fact could be significant for ongoing experiments , _",
    "e.g. _ in refs .",
    "@xcite where spin gradient thermometry has been used to measure temperatures as low as 350 pk in a 3d optical lattice .",
    "our calculation here indicates that it is much easier to observe xy - ferromagnetism for higher filling due to the enhanced critical temperature .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we now consider asymmetric values for the hopping amplitudes @xmath116 and @xmath117 . by adjusting the chemical potentials",
    ", we obtain a globally almost balanced mixture with @xmath118 with @xmath107 .",
    "[ fig14 ] shows the atomic densities and xy - ferromagnetic spin - order for different temperatures ( four panels ) .",
    "the most remarkable new feature of the asymmetric hopping regime is the vanishing ferromagnetic order in the @xmath3 domain where @xmath119 even at @xmath52 .",
    "we also find that the total density profile first becomes sharper and then smoother again with increase of temperature .",
    "this is due to the higher spin entropy of the unordered two - component mott insulator .",
    "details will be discussed in a future publication @xcite .",
    "vs temperature for the _ homogeneous _ system .",
    "interactions are set to @xmath120 with hopping amplitudes @xmath116 and @xmath121 and total filling @xmath4 . ]",
    "it is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] that the lighter species ( _ i.e. _ the one with larger hopping ) always dominates the density distribution in the superfluid area where @xmath122 , since in this regime the particle mobility plays a more important role than in the mott domains . for the mott state ( @xmath123 )",
    "the situation differs . in the spin model language @xcite ,",
    "different hopping amplitudes lead to the existence of an effective magnetic field @xcite , @xmath124 where @xmath125 .",
    "this effective magnetic field gives rise to an imbalance between @xmath126 and @xmath127 which we quantify by the z - magnetization @xmath128 . at the mott plateau with @xmath3 ,",
    "the magnetization will shrink from @xmath129 ( maximum of z - magnetization due to a large effective magnetic field ) to zero with increasing @xmath60 due to thermal fluctuations . at the mott plateau with @xmath4 ,",
    "the magnetization depends non - monotonically on temperature . in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] , we show the temperature dependence of the magnetization at filling @xmath4 plateau by focusing on the trap center and performing a finite-@xmath60 study with a single - site bdmft for the _ homogeneous _ model .",
    "this behavior can be understood if we notice that in the filling @xmath4 region the system favors a state with a small magnetization @xmath130 at zero temperature due to a non - zero effective magnetic field . once the temperature starts to increase from zero to a finite value",
    ", thermal fluctuations will come into play and compete with quantum fluctuations , which makes the imbalance reach a maximum at finite t , since both types of fluctuations can delocalize the atoms and smooth the imbalance between the two species .",
    "when the temperature increases even higher , the larger thermal fluctuations will simply smear out the imbalance .       for weak hopping amplitudes at @xmath52 , calculated within lda+bdmft .",
    "interactions are @xmath120 , hopping amplitudes @xmath131 , with a harmonic trap @xmath106 and @xmath132 . ]    finally , we also investigate the non - magnetic mott state without symmetry breaking which occurs at @xmath4 for relatively low hopping amplitudes @xmath133 ( see also the homogeneous phase diagrams fig .  [ fig2new ] ) .",
    "[ fig16 ] ( top panel ) shows the results for atomic densities , their superfluid order parameters and the correlator @xmath76 . at the center of the trap we indeed find a mott state without symmetry breaking similar to the 2d case ( fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied magnetic ordering of a two - component bose gas in 2d and 3d optical lattices . by using bdmft",
    "we have calculated the phase diagrams of the homogeneous bose - hubbard model in a 3d cubic lattice with total particle filling @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which feature superfluid and mott - insulating phases and also notably reveal ordered phases with xy - ferromagnetism and nel - antiferromagnetism in the mott domain .",
    "we investigate the critical temperatures of these long - range ordered states .",
    "moreover we have confirmed the stability of these magnetic phases in a trapped 2d or 3d system . in the case of a 3d cubic lattice ,",
    "we have in particular computed xy - ferromagnetic ordering at finite temperatures which is relevant for current experiments @xcite .",
    "another important issue is the detection of novel magnetic phases with long - range spin order . for an antiferromagnetic phase",
    ", spin - sensitive detection can be used to detect the nel - type order , i.e. one spin component can be detected after removing the other one using spin - selective single - site addressing , as pointed recently @xcite . for the xy - ferromagnetic phase , one could apply a @xmath134 pulse with a position - dependent phase ( linear gradient ) , thus probing locally with different phases . for",
    "xy - ferromagnetic long - range order one would thus observe stripes with regular spacing when the phase matches and the @xmath134 pulse transfers all atoms into one of the two spin states @xcite .",
    "achieving the necessary ultra - low temperatures for detecting magnetic ordering of cold bosons in optical lattices has so far remained elusive .",
    "however , it is anticipated that by further experimental advances this obstacle will be overcome in the near future @xcite .",
    "our results provide theoretical benchmarks which in the future will also be extended to other geometries such as triangular or hexagonal lattices .",
