    "high - resolution infrared laboratory spectra are an essential element in numerous fields of science such as atmospheric chemistry @xcite and astronomy @xcite .",
    "these high - resolution spectra allow molecular emission and absorption features to be accurately identified and assigned ; for example the detection of ` water on the sun ' @xcite was made possible by the use of high - resolution hot water ( h@xmath9o ) line lists derived from experimental spectra .",
    "the h@xmath9o molecule is able to exist in sunspots ( typically 3,000  4,500 k ) , and observations showed that many previously unassigned lines were in fact due to the ubiquitous h@xmath9o molecule .",
    "molecules form in ` cool ' sources @xcite and progress in infrared astronomy has led to the identification of numerous molecules in cool stars @xcite , brown dwarfs @xcite and , most recently , in exoplanets @xcite .",
    "after h and he , c , n and o are the most abundant elements , so in cool objects one anticipates that methane ( ch@xmath10 ) , nh@xmath0 , and h@xmath9o will be abundant . although the spectra of the fundamental infrared bands of ` cold ' ( i.e. room temperature ) ch@xmath10 , nh@xmath0 , and h@xmath9o have been understood for many years , the situation for overtones , hot bands and combination bands is not so sanguine . for h@xmath9o",
    "it is only recently that high resolution experimental and theoretical line lists suitable for computing the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of astronomical objects with temperatures in the 300  4000 k range have become available @xcite .",
    "for ` hot ' ch@xmath10 , there are only some rather sparse experimental observations and no satisfactory quantitative theoretical understanding . for hot nh@xmath0",
    ", there has been some recent theoretical progress @xcite and we report here on an extensive set of experimental observations in the thermal infrared .",
    "the nh@xmath0 molecule is one of the simplest polyatomic molecules with four atoms forming a trigonal pyramidal structure with c@xmath11 symmetry @xcite .",
    "nh@xmath0 has @xmath12 fundamental vibrational modes , of which two are doubly degenerate .",
    "there are therefore four fundamental vibrational frequencies @xmath13 at 3336.2 @xmath2 ( n - h stretch ) , @xmath14 at 932.5 @xmath2 ( umbrella mode ) , @xmath15 at 3443.6 @xmath2 ( n - h stretch ) and @xmath16 at 1626.1 @xmath2 ( bend ) , of which @xmath17 and @xmath5 are degenerate ( table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "there is an additional complication in the spectroscopy of nh@xmath0 due to the low barrier to ` inversion ' .",
    "although nh@xmath0 is non - planar at equilibrium the three hydrogen atoms can flip through the plane containing the n atom and perpendicular to the c@xmath0 symmetry axis .",
    "lcrrl|lrl [ tab1 ] @xmath18 & @xmath19 & 3336.2 & ( 3337.2 ) & symmetric stretch & @xmath20 & 9.9443 @xmath2 + @xmath3 & @xmath19 & 932.5 & ( 968.3 ) & symmetric bend ( umbrella ) & @xmath21 & 6.196 @xmath2 + @xmath17 & @xmath22 & 3443.6 & ( 3443.9 ) & asymmetric stretch & @xmath23 & 1.0173  + @xmath5 & @xmath22 & 1626.1 & ( 1627.4 ) & asymmetric bend & @xmath24 & 107.8 @xmath1 +    if the h atoms were labeled this would correspond to a right - handed form of the molecule converting into a left - handed form .",
    "hence , there are two forms ( frameworks ) of the nh@xmath0 molecule ( energy levels are conventionally labeled as @xmath25 and @xmath26 or + and - ) which can interconvert . indeed , the interconversion frequency at 24 ghz ( @xmath27 transition for @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) can be used by radio astronomers to monitor nh@xmath0 in dark interstellar clouds @xcite . in general , this inversion motion doubles vibration - rotation lines ( each of the two interconverting forms has slightly different energy levels ) and leads to the two slightly different band origins listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "nh@xmath0 is an oblate symmetric top ( @xmath30 @xmath2 , @xmath31 @xmath2 ) and the fundamental modes are either parallel ( @xmath18 and @xmath3 , @xmath32 ) or perpendicular ( @xmath17 and @xmath5 , @xmath33 ) depending on whether the infrared transition dipole moment is oscillating parallel or perpendicular to the c@xmath0 symmetry axis . the rotational quantum numbers @xmath34 and @xmath35 , describe the quantization of the total angular momentum ( excluding nuclear spin ) and its projection onto the symmetry axis , respectively .",
    "rotational selection rules ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) for a parallel transition lead to a simple @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 structure ( @xmath41 ) with a small @xmath35 splitting . the selection rules for perpendicular transitions ( @xmath42 , @xmath37 ) lead to a more complex pattern with widely spaced @xmath35 structure , organized into @xmath35 sub - bands each with different @xmath43 values and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 structure @xcite .    over the years",
    ", numerous studies have been undertaken to assign the complicated nh@xmath0 spectrum @xcite .",
    "many studies are of cold nh@xmath44 and are useful when studying planetary atmospheres in our solar system @xcite .",
    "some work has been done in determining empirical lower state energies @xcite as well as on the rotation - inversion spectra @xcite .",
    "recently there has been considerable progress in the variational calculation of vibration - rotation energy levels and transitions from adjusted ab initio potential energy surfaces @xcite .",
    "calculated line lists suitable for spectra of ammonia at 300 k @xcite and 1500 k @xcite are now available .",
    "cool objects are less luminous than hot stars and emit most of their radiation in the infrared .",
    "high resolution infrared spectra of these objects are best recorded with large 10 m class telescopes . in 1995 the first brown dwarf , gliese 229b was identified by the presence of methane in its spectrum @xcite .",
    "objects with masses less than 0.0075 solar masses are unable to fuse hydrogen in their cores @xcite and are called brown dwarfs .",
    "brown dwarf atmospheres are cool enough ( typically 700  2,000 k ) to sustain a rich molecular environment @xcite .",
    "since the discovery of gliese 229b , the l and t classes have been introduced to describe objects cooler than m - dwarfs @xcite .",
    "l - dwarfs display near infrared electronic transitions of metal hydrides such as feh @xcite and crh @xcite and have weak tio and vo transitions which are characteristic of m - dwarfs @xcite .",
    "in contrast , t - dwarfs like gliese 229b have prominent overtone transitions of hot h@xmath9o and ch@xmath10 @xcite . based on observations taken from the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    ", @xcite identified prominent h@xmath9o , ch@xmath10 and nh@xmath0 absorption bands between 6  14 @xmath4 m , including the nh@xmath0 @xmath3 band near 11 @xmath4 m .",
    "it is predicted that a new cooler classification , a y - dwarf ( @xmath45 700 k ) is required below the t - dwarf class @xcite with the prediction that strong nh@xmath0 absorptions will help to differentiate the y - dwarfs from t - dwarfs @xcite .",
    "numerous unassigned features are present in the observed seds of brown dwarfs . due to a lack of experimental data recorded in",
    "the temperature ranges appropriate for these objects ( or reliable theoretical predictions ) , the best option is to extrapolate room temperature ` cold ' line parameters such as the hitran 2008 database @xcite to the temperature of interest ( typically 1000 k for sub - stellar brown dwarfs ) .",
    "for this reason , these extrapolated spectra rarely match observations satisfactorily ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) due to the lack of hot bands and highly - excited rotational transitions which contribute significantly to the sed in these temperature ranges .    [ fig1 ]    along with brown dwarfs , it has only recently become possible to detect planets outside of the solar system ( exoplanets ) .",
    "51 pegasi b was the pioneering discovery by @xcite that paved the way for many more exoplanet detections , with over 500 discovered to date ( http://exoplanet.eu/ ) .",
    "the vast majority of these exoplanets are large gas giants close to their parent star with high temperature gaseous atmospheres typically referred to as ` hot jupiters ' .",
    "the new technique of ` transit spectroscopy ' @xcite has been used to probe exoplanet atmospheres @xcite and familiar molecules such as h@xmath9o , ch@xmath10 , co and co@xmath9 have all been shown to be present in examples like the well studied hd 209458b @xcite .",
    "the properties ( composition , temperature / pressure profiles , etc . ) of exoplanet atmospheres retrieved from the emergent flux or from transit spectroscopy depend on the molecular opacities used to simulate the observed spectra .",
    "spectroscopic studies of brown dwarfs and exoplanet atmospheres therefore need improved line parameters for hot nh@xmath0 and ch@xmath10 .",
    "currently the best line list for nh@xmath0 is the hitran 2008 database , which is incomplete and has insufficient hot band information for the astronomical applications considered here .",
    "moreover recent theoretical work has demonstrated that hitran 2008 has many errors in quantum number assignments of nh@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "nh@xmath0 has already been shown to contribute significantly to the sed of brown dwarfs at @xmath46620 k @xcite",
    ". improved theoretical predictions for the vibration - rotation lines will help to assign the complicated spectra of nh@xmath0 @xcite presented in this paper .",
    "we provide high temperature line lists for nh@xmath0 using a similar approach to that of @xcite ; in addition we derive empirical lower state energies for many of the lines .",
    "the line lists can be used directly to model the seds of brown dwarfs leading to a better understanding of the t-/y - dwarf boundary and perhaps allow the first identification of nh@xmath0 in an exoplanet atmosphere .",
    "laboratory emission spectra of hot nh@xmath0 were recorded using a system similar to that used by @xcite to study hot ch@xmath10 .",
    "a diagram of the experiment is shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "an alumina ( al@xmath9o@xmath0 ) sample tube is sealed with windows and evacuated .",
    "a constant slow flow of nh@xmath0 gas is introduced to the system and a constant pressure is maintained using a needle valve which helps to minimize the build up of impurities and loss of sample within the system . surrounding the central 51 cm of the al@xmath9o@xmath0 tube ( 121 cm long ) is a controllable tube furnace capable of maintaining stable temperatures up to 1370@xmath1c .",
    "the radiation exiting the al@xmath9o@xmath0 tube is focussed into a fourier transform infrared ( ft - ir ) spectrometer using a lens and the distance between the window on the end of the al@xmath9o@xmath0 tube and the ft - ir spectrometer entrance aperture was 20 cm .",
    "this volume was purged with ` dry air ' ( h@xmath9o absent ) to minimize the presence of h@xmath9o absorption lines in the emission spectra .",
    "[ fig2 ]    we recorded all spectra in two sections to improve the signal - to - noise ratio ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) and the experimental conditions for each region are listed in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the two selected regions were a consequence of the available filters and constituent materials of the system .",
    "the first region covered the range 740  1690 @xmath2 and was recorded with thallium bromoiodide ( krs-5 ) windows , a potassium bromide ( kbr ) beamsplitter , a zinc selenide ( znse ) lens and a liquid nitrogen cooled mercury - cadmium telluride ( mct ) detector .",
    "the lower wavenumber cut off was limited due to the band gap of the mct detector and a small part of the nh@xmath0 @xmath3 umbrella mode could not be observed .",

    "this second region covered the nh@xmath0 @xmath5 bending mode , plus the r - branch of the @xmath3 mode .",
    "for both regions , 11 spectra were recorded at 100@xmath1c intervals between 300@xmath1c and 1300@xmath1c .",
    "the twelfth spectrum was recorded at 1370@xmath1c because the furnace had difficultly reaching 1400@xmath1c .",
    "the resolution was chosen based on the pressure and doppler broadening widths and the final line list was created by cutting both regions at 1350 @xmath2 and combining them to make a list of lines ranging from 740 - 2100 @xmath2 for each temperature .",
    "a thermocouple within the interior of the tube furnace combined with a programmable controller was used to measure the furnace temperature and maintain high temperatures over long time periods .",
    "it was necessary to water cool the ends of the al@xmath9o@xmath0 tube to avoid damaging the rubber o - rings at both ends of the tube which maintained the pressure seal .",
    "as a result , the ends of the al@xmath9o@xmath0 tube are at a lower temperature than the central portion and because of the strong temperature dependence , the observed infrared emission spectra are dominated by the high temperature central portion of the heated sample .    all spectra contain emission lines of nh@xmath0 assumed to be at the furnace temperature .",
    "the baseline of each spectrum depends upon the temperature and arrangement of the system ; it originates primarily from thermal emission from the al@xmath9o@xmath0 tube walls .",
    "the spectra also contain a small number of absorption lines due to h@xmath9o vapor ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "we also observed absorption of strong lines due to cold nh@xmath0 in the beam path , mainly in the end of the tube nearest the spectrometer . a description of how we deal with these absorption lines is given below .",
    "once the spectra had been recorded , the peak - picking programme wspectra @xcite was used to identify all of the emission peaks at each temperature ; the number of lines in each file is given in table [ tab3 ] . the same program was then used to fit a voigt profile to every emission line to create a line list ( wavenumber , arbitrary intensity ) for each temperature .",
    "the lines in the overlapping 1080  1690 @xmath2 portion were compared at each temperature and calibrated to region 1 .",
    "it was decided that the two regions would be joined at 1350 @xmath2 as there is a natural minimum in the line emissions and this value was approximately in the center of the overlapping section .",
    "hence from here onwards , region 1 contains lines in the range 740  1350 @xmath2 and region 2 contains the lines 1350  2100 @xmath2 .",

    "the average @xmath102 difference was found to be 147 @xmath2 which corresponds to 3.5% .",
    "however , the average magnitude of the deviation is determined to be 364 @xmath2 corresponding to 30% . since these lines have been largely removed from the final line lists and replaced by the actual hitran values due to self absorption issues , we consider these errors to be an over estimation .",
    "another measure of the quality of the empirical lower state energy can be obtained from the number of points ( i.e. the number of line lists each particular line appears in ) used to calculate the value . for lines occurring in 10  12 spectra",
    "the @xmath6 was calculated from the points below 1000@xmath1c and has a quality factor of ` 1 ' , these are considered to have the least error . for lines in which an @xmath6 can still be determined from points below 1000@xmath1c ( i.e. occur in at least 3 spectra below 1000@xmath1c ) but occur in less than 10 spectra overall , the quality factor is ` 2 ' . for any line",
    "in which an @xmath6 is still able to be determined but only from 3 points including spectra above 1000@xmath1c , then the quality factor is ` 3 ' , and are considered to have the greatest error .",
    "any line where @xmath6 can not be accurately determined ( i.e. less than 3 points ) , then the quality factor is ` 0 ' .",
    "the hitran lines which occur in the line lists have a quality factor of ` 1h ' and are are taken from @xcite .",
    "the quality factors can be seen in table [ tab7 ] and the effect on the lower state energy can be seen in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "the ammonia line lists have been wavenumber calibrated with the hitran 2008 database and are accurate to within @xmath480.002 @xmath2 .",
    "the intensity was also calibrated with the hitran 2008 database by extrapolating the intensities using equation 3 to the temperatures of the recorded spectra .",
    "an error in the calibrated intensity of perhaps a factor of two is suggested for our line lists .",
    "although this seems large , emission intensities are notoriously difficult to calibrate @xcite .",
    "we have accounted for the instrument response by recording a blackbody spectrum and correcting the intensities with the instrument response function .",
    "the most notable corrections were obvious towards the edge of each spectral region ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "blending of lines also causes errors in line intensities and in the empirical lower state energy .",
    "these blended lines cause problems when matching our observations with hitran and make it difficult to identify the contribution of each line to the observed peak .",
    "we have tried to reduce our intensity calibration error by comparing as many spectral lines with hitran lines as possible .",
    "each comparison gives an intensity calibration factor and after outliers have been removed a general factor can be obtained .",
    "the temperature of the experiment was accurate to within @xmath4810 k but this only applies to the central portion of the al@xmath9o@xmath0 tube which is surrounded by the furnace .",
    "there is therefore a temperature gradient within the al@xmath9o@xmath0 tube which affects the shape of some lines as discussed by @xcite .",
    "this effect can be observed in the emission spectra as we see absorption of the low _ j _ fundamental nh@xmath0 lines due to cooler gas towards the tube ends change to emission as the temperature of the tube increases ( see figure [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "[ fig9 ]    at higher temperatures the al@xmath9o@xmath0 tube ends are sufficiently hot and the emission from the center is stronger so they no longer completely absorb the low _ j _ fundamental lines leading to differences between successive spectra starting around 1000 @xmath1c .",
    "as long as the center of the tube is ` cool ' ( @xmath45900 @xmath1c ) the fundamental low _",
    "j _ lines appear in absorption , however for temperatures greater than 1000 @xmath1c the fundamental low _",
    "j _ lines start to appear in emission .",
    "moreover , because the doppler broadening depends on temperature the emitted lines are broader than the absorption lines .",
    "this leads to an absorption feature in the middle of an emission line which can sometimes cause apparent splitting of the line ( e.g. the line at 1095.13 @xmath2 in figure [ fig9 ] ) . to solve this problem ,",
    "we have processed each line list and inserted hitran lines with intensities greater than @xmath101 cm / molecule at that temperature , denoted by ` 1h ' in the line lists .",
    "we also simultaneously removed the emission lines showing this splitting effect , and also any lines which are within @xmath480.005 @xmath2 of each hitran line with an intensity greater than @xmath101 cm / molecule .",
    "our line lists therefore provide a complete representation of nh@xmath0 between 740  2100 @xmath2 at temperatures between 300  1370@xmath1c .",
    "a useful check for the quality of the calibrated intensities determined between 740  2100 @xmath2 can be verified by an intensity sum comparison with the temperature scaled hitran intensities @xcite . at 300@xmath1c ,",
    "the sum of the intensities in our linelist is only 7% greater than the sum of the intensity scaled hitran lines but as the temperature increases we continue to exceed the hitran total intensity with a maximum of 105% greater at 1200@xmath1c ( table [ tab8 ] ) .",
    "we attribute our larger values to an increase in the number of hot band lines present in the spectrum .",
    "these hot lines only have a small contribution at ` low ' temperatures ( 300@xmath1c ) but are more significant for higher temperatures ( @xmath103c ) as hot transitions become more favorable .",
    "indeed , this comes as no surprise because the hitran database consists mainly of fundamental transitions and highlights how our line lists are more suitable for astrophysical applications .",

    ", empirical lower state energies were also determined by @xcite for unassigned lines in the 4791  5294 @xmath2 region .",
    "another method has been used recently to obtain lower state energies for near infrared lines of ch@xmath10 by cooling an absorption cell @xcite . for the ft - ir method presented here , we have line lists at 12 individual temperatures each of which requires many hours to obtain . as a result , we are only able to use a maximum of 12 points in the calculation of the empirical lower state energy for each line and in fact , this was reduced to 8 points as the intensity of the lines above 1000@xmath1c begin to decrease in strength due to the dissociation of the molecule .",
    "our accuracy depends on the number of points used in the calculation of @xmath6 and for this reason , our line lists also include a quality factor which only applies to the empirical lower state energy .",
    "this @xmath6 method is used to determine an important characteristic of each line whilst knowing nothing of the spectroscopic quantum number assignments .",
    "the inclusion of hitran lines in our line lists has benefits as well as problems .",
    "the main benefit is that the line lists now contain the strong lines which were absent from the observations and as a result are more suitable for simulation of astronomical spectra ( figure [ fig1 ] ) . as a consequence of including these strong lines ( @xmath101 cm / molecule ) ,",
    "some observed lines have been removed because they have the same frequency as the hitran line .",
    "it was decided that the benefits of including the hitran lines outweighed the costs of removing coincident emission lines .",
    "the errors associated with the empirical lower state energies have been based on comparisons with hitran however , as the majority of lines used to determine the errors are self absorbed , it does not accurately represent all of the lines in each spectrum .",
    "indeed , at low temperatures the strong lines which are present display self absorption even if it is not immediately apparent from the line shape and at high temperatures there are few lines to draw conclusive comparisons from , since they are not given in hitran . the overall maximum error of the empirical lower state energies in the line list should therefore be taken as 30% , but we believe that the quality factor gives a better indication of how accurate the empirical lower state energy is for each line .",
    "there are two approaches to obtaining an ammonia line list to model brown dwarf and exoplanet spectra : the first is experimental measurement consistent with the work presented here and the second is an _ ab initio _ theoretical calculation .",
    "these two methods each have their own strengths and weaknesses , but in general are complementary .",
    "the experimental approach provides fewer lines but more accurate line positions , while the theoretical approach provides many more lines but with reduced line position accuracy .",
    "calculated line lists are particularly useful for assigning quantum numbers to the measured lines , which can then be used to improve the calculations",
    ". such line assignments of new nh@xmath0 data are currently underway and will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the line lists provided are given in the format shown in table [ tab7 ] and can be obtained as electronic supplements with extra details and spectra provided upon request .",
    "it is important to note that the line lists are temperature specific and should only be used at the appropriate temperature .",
    "if the intensities need to be scaled , then the closest temperature line list should be chosen and the empirical lower state energies can be used to adjust the lines intensities as needed ( using equation 3 ) to reach additional temperatures .",
    "we are currently in the process of completing our nh@xmath0 measurements in the 3 micron region and are set to record new spectra in the near infrared ; a similar comprehensive study of ch@xmath10 is also underway .",
    "we have produced ` hot ' experimental line lists of nh@xmath0 at temperatures 300  1300@xmath1c in 100@xmath1c intervals and at 1370@xmath1c .",
    "each line list has been wavenumber and intensity calibrated using the hitran 2008 database and from this we have been able to derive empirical lower state energies from the temperature dependance of line intensities .",
    "the line lists can be used directly to model nh@xmath0 between 740  2100 @xmath2 ( 4.76  13.5 @xmath4 m ) in brown dwarfs and exoplanets .",
