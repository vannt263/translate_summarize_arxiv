    "super  kamiokande high statistics data  @xcite indicate that the observed deficit in the @xmath7-like atmospheric events is due to the neutrinos arriving at the detector at large zenith angles , strongly suggestive of the @xmath1 oscillation hypothesis .",
    "similarly , their data on the zenith angle dependence and recoil energy spectrum of solar neutrinos  @xcite in combination with the results from homestake  @xcite , sage  @xcite , and gallex+gno  @xcite experiments , have put on a firm observational basis the long  standing problem of solar neutrinos , strongly indicating the need for @xmath0 conversions .",
    "in addition to the solar and atmospheric neutrino results from underground experiments , there is also the indication for neutrino oscillations in the @xmath8 channel by the lsnd experiment  @xcite .",
    "all these results can be accommodated in a single oscillation framework only if there are at least three different scales of neutrino mass - squared differences .",
    "the simplest case in which this condition is satisfied requires the existence of a fourth light neutrino , which must be _ sterile _ ( _ i.e. _  having interactions with standard model particles much weaker than the sm weak interaction ) in order not to affect the invisible @xmath9 decay width , precisely measured at lep  @xcite .",
    "there are various analyses in the literature comparing the oscillation channels into active or sterile neutrinos for both solar  @xcite and atmospheric data  @xcite performed in the framework of two  neutrino oscillations ( where oscillations occur into either an active or a sterile state ) .",
    "in particular the super  kamiokande collaboration has claimed the oscillation into sterile neutrinos to be disfavoured both for solar  @xcite and atmospheric neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "however , when considered in the framework of four  neutrino mixing , oscillations into pure active or pure sterile states are only limiting cases of the most general possibility of oscillations into an admixture of active and sterile neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "such a more general framework of four  neutrino mixing has also been analysed in recent studies , which have put constraints on the active  sterile admixture either in the context of solar  @xcite or atmospheric  @xcite neutrino oscillations , respectively .",
    "in this paper we present a _ combined _ analysis of the neutrino oscillation solutions of both the solar and the atmospheric neutrino problem , in the framework of four  neutrino mixing .",
    "we include in our analysis the most recent solar neutrino rates of homestake  @xcite , sage  @xcite , gallex and gno  @xcite , as well as the recent 1258 day super  kamiokande data sample  @xcite , including the recoil electron energy spectrum for both day and night periods .",
    "as for atmospheric neutrinos we include in our analysis all the contained event from the latest 79.5 kton - yr super ",
    "kamiokande data set  @xcite , as well as the upward - going neutrino - induced muon fluxes from both super  kamiokande and the macro detector  @xcite .",
    "the constraints arising from relevant reactor ( mainly from bugey  @xcite ) and accelerator ( cdhsw  @xcite and ccfr  @xcite ) experiments are also imposed .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] we summarize the main expressions for the neutrino oscillation formulas that we use in the analysis of solar and atmospheric neutrino data which take into account matter effects both in the propagation in the sun and in the earth .",
    "sections  [ solar ] and  [ atmos ] contain the results for the analysis of the four  neutrino oscillation parameters for solar and atmospheric data respectively .",
    "the results for the full combined analysis are described in sec .  [",
    "combined ] , with particular emphasis on the active  sterile oscillation admixture which better allows for a simultaneous description of the solar and atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "our results show that , against what may be naively expected , although the super  kamiokande data disfavours both the pure @xmath4 atmospheric channel and the pure @xmath6 solar channel , the result from the combined analysis still favours any of these close  to  pure active and sterile oscillations and disfavours oscillations into a near  maximal active  sterile admixture .",
    "there are six possible four  neutrino schemes that can accommodate the results from solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments as well as the lsnd evidence .",
    "they can be divided in two classes : @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in the @xmath10 schemes",
    "there is a group of three neutrino masses separated from an isolated one by a gap of the order of 1  ev@xmath12 which is responsible for the short - baseline oscillations observed in the lsnd experiment . in @xmath11 schemes",
    "there are two pairs of close masses separated by the lsnd gap .",
    "@xmath10 schemes are disfavoured by experimental data with respect to the @xmath11 schemes  @xcite , but they are still marginally allowed  @xcite .",
    "therefore we concentrate in the @xmath11 schemes shown in fig .",
    "[ fourab ] . for the phenomenology of neutrino oscillations",
    "these two schemes are equivalent up to the relabeling of the mass eigenstates ( or equivalently of the mixing angles ) .",
    "thus in what follows we will consider the scheme b where the mass spectrum presents the hierarchy : @xmath13 ( we use the common notation @xmath14 ) . in this four - neutrino mixing scheme ,",
    "the flavour neutrino fields @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) are related to the mass eigenstates fields @xmath17 by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a @xmath20 unitary mixing matrix . neglecting possible cp phases ,",
    "the matrix @xmath19 can be written as a product of six rotations , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the order of the product of the matrices corresponds to a specific parametrization of the mixing matrix @xmath19 . in order to study oscillations of the solar and atmospheric neutrinos which include the matter effects in the sun and/or in the earth",
    ", it is convenient to use the following parametrization  @xcite : @xmath30 this general form can be further simplified by taking into account the negative results from the reactor experiments , in particular the bugey one  @xcite which implies that @xmath31 in the range of @xmath32 relevant for the lsnd experiment .",
    "this leads to an upper bound on the projection of the @xmath0 over the 34 states : @xmath33 so that the two angles @xmath34 and @xmath35 must be small and their contribution to solar and atmospheric neutrino transitions is negligible .",
    "therefore , in what follows we will set these two angles to zero , although one must keep in mind that at least one of them must be non - vanishing in order to account for the lsnd observation .    in the approximation",
    "@xmath36 the @xmath19 matrix takes the form : @xmath37 in the rest of this section we will discuss the consequences of the mixing structure of eq .",
    "( [ umatrix ] ) on the relevant transition probabilities for solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",
    "the transition probabilities that take into account matter effects have been derived in ref .",
    "some improvement concerning the calculation of the regeneration of solar @xmath0 s in the earth was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we summarize the discussion on the flavour composition of the relevant states for both solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations .      in the scheme here considered ,",
    "solar neutrino oscillations are generated by the mass - squared difference between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ umatrix ] ) that the survival of solar @xmath0 s mainly depends on the mixing angle @xmath40 , whereas the mixing angles @xmath2 and @xmath3 determine the relative amount of transitions into sterile @xmath41 or active @xmath1 and @xmath42 .",
    "let us remind the reader that @xmath1 and @xmath42 can not be distinguished in solar neutrino experiments , since their matter potential and their interaction in the detectors are due only to neutral - current weak interactions and therefore they are equal .",
    "thus , instead of @xmath1 and @xmath42 , one can consider the linear combinations @xmath43 with @xmath44 the mixing of @xmath45 and @xmath46 with @xmath39 and @xmath38 is given by @xmath47 so that the solar neutrino oscillations occur only between the states @xmath48 with mixing angle @xmath40 , and @xmath49 gives the size of the projection of the sterile neutrino onto the state in which the solar @xmath0 oscillates to .",
    "therefore , solar neutrino oscillations depend only on @xmath40 and the product @xmath50 .",
    "we distinguish the following limiting cases of eq .",

    "since the mixing of @xmath0 with @xmath39 and @xmath38 is described by a two - generation equation with mixing angle @xmath40 , the mixing of @xmath41 with @xmath39 and @xmath38 is given by the same formula multiplied by @xmath50 , and the mixing of @xmath45 with @xmath39 and @xmath38 is again described by the same equation times @xmath60 , it is clear that , in the general case of simultaneous @xmath6 and @xmath55 oscillations , the corresponding probabilities are given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 takes the standard two  neutrino oscillation form  @xcite for @xmath63 and @xmath40 , found by numerically solving the evolution equation in the sun and the earth matter with the modified matter potential @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 . here",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 are , respectively , the number densities of electrons and neutrons in the medium , @xmath69 is the neutrino energy and @xmath70 is the fermi constant .",
    "these expressions satisfy the relation of probability conservation @xmath71 .",
    "the analysis of the solar neutrino data in the four  neutrino mixing schemes is therefore equivalent to the two  neutrino analysis but taking into account that the parameter space is now three ",

    "although originally this derivation was performed in the framework of the @xmath11 schemes  @xcite , it is equally valid for the @xmath10 ones  @xcite",
    ".    let us finally comment on the range of variation of the mixing parameters . choosing the convention that @xmath73 , from eqs .",
    "( [ pes ] ) and  ( [ pea ] ) it is clear that for solar neutrino oscillations the full physical space is covered by choosing the mixing angles in the ranges : @xmath74 actually , since the dependence on @xmath2 and @xmath3 enters only through the combination @xmath75 , for what concerns the solar neutrino phenomenology one of these mixing angles could be fixed to zero .",
    "however , as we will see in the next section , they enter independently in the relevant probabilities for atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "atmospheric neutrino oscillations are generated by the mass - squared difference between @xmath76 and @xmath77 . from eq .",
    "( [ umatrix ] ) one sees that the atmospheric @xmath0 s are not affected by the four  neutrino oscillations in the approximation @xmath78 and neglecting the effect of @xmath63 in the range of atmospheric neutrino energies .",

    "the mixing angles @xmath2 and @xmath3 determine the relative amount of @xmath1 transitions into sterile @xmath41 or active @xmath42 . more explicitly eq .",
    "( [ umatrix ] ) implies that the atmospheric neutrino oscillations , _",

    "furthermore , the negative results from the cdhs  @xcite and ccfr  @xcite experiments on searches for @xmath1disappearance also constrain such projection to be @xmath95 at 90% cl for @xmath96 ev@xmath12 .",

    "it is this modification of the earth matter potential what gives to the atmospheric neutrino data the capability to discriminate between the active and sterile oscillation solution . in particular ,",
    "higher sensitivity to this potential effect is achievable for the higher energy part of the atmospheric neutrino flux which lead to the upward going muon data .",
    "the main effect of the presence of this potential is that for pure active oscillations the angular distribution of upgoing muons is expected to be steeper at larger arrival angles , while a flattening is expected due to the matter effects for sterile oscillations  @xcite .    from eqs .",
    "( [ nuatm ] ) and  ( [ aatm ] ) we see that , unlike in the case of solar neutrinos , the angles @xmath2 and @xmath3 enter independently in the atmospheric oscillations .",

    "let us comment here that , unlike for the case of atmospheric neutrinos where the discrimination between active and sterile oscillations arises from the difference in the matter potentials , for solar neutrinos the main source of difference is due to the lack of neutral current contribution to the water cerenkov experiments for the sterile case . unlike active neutrinos which lead to events in the super  kamiokande detector by interacting via nc with the electrons , sterile neutrinos",
    "do not contribute to the super  kamiokande event rates .",
    "therefore a larger survival probability for @xmath124b neutrinos is needed to accommodate the measured rate . as a consequence a larger contribution from @xmath124b neutrinos to the chlorine and gallium experiments is expected , so that the small measured rate in chlorine can only be accommodated if no @xmath125be neutrinos are present in the flux .",
    "this is only possible in the sma solution region , since in the lma and low regions the suppression of @xmath125be neutrinos is not enough .",
    "notice also that the sma region for oscillations into sterile neutrinos is slightly shifted downwards as compared to the active case .",
    "this is due to the small modification of the neutrino survival probability induced by the different matter potentials .",

    "the values quoted in eq .",

    "this is not the same as the allowed range of @xmath123 at a given cl when the parameters @xmath133 are left free to vary , either in the full parameter space or within a given solution .",
    "such limits would be obtained by imposing the condition @xmath134 where @xmath135 is minimized in the parameter space 12 ( or in a given region of such parameter space ) and @xmath117 is minimized in the same region of the space 12 and in the mixing @xmath123 .    in what follows we label as `` constrained '' the results of analyses when the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath40 are varied within a given solution while `` unconstrained '' refers to the case where we allow the variation of @xmath63 and @xmath40 in the full plane . for the unconstrained fit the corresponding curve in fig .",

    "we have studied the behaviour of the global @xmath188 function defined as @xmath189 with the mixing angles @xmath2 and @xmath3 determining the active  sterile admixture for the following scenarios :    * atm+sol@xmath190 : in this case we minimize @xmath188 with respect to @xmath63 , @xmath40 , @xmath162 and @xmath79 , allowing @xmath191 and @xmath40 to change from lma to sma as the active  sterile admixture controlled by @xmath2 and @xmath3 change .",
    "the @xmath1 projection @xmath192 is free to vary in the range allowed by the analysis ; * atm@xmath193+sol@xmath190 : in this case we fix @xmath194 , so @xmath195 .",

    "we minimize @xmath188 with respect to @xmath63 , @xmath40 , @xmath162 and @xmath79 , with @xmath63 and @xmath40 constrained to be in the lma ( sma ) region .    in table",
    "[ table_comb ] we give the values @xmath199 of the best fit point and its associated gof in the six  dimensional ( five  dimensional for the `` restricted '' case ) space in each of these cases together with the best fit value of the mixings @xmath200 and @xmath201 . in fig .",
    "[ chi2_combined ] we plot the shift in @xmath157 from the corresponding global minimum in each of the scenarios as the mixing @xmath202 varies . from the table and the figure",
    "we find the following behaviours :    * there are two favourite configurations which we will denote as near  pure  sterile solar neutrino oscillations plus near  pure  active atmospheric neutrino oscillations ( npss+npaa ) , and close  to  active solar neutrino oscillations plus close  to  sterile atmospheric neutrino oscillations ( cas+csa ) , respectively .",
    "npss+npaa oscillations are characterized by the minima @xmath203 where the exact position of the minimum depends on the allowed admixture @xmath204 .",
    "cas+csa oscillations are characterized by the minima @xmath205 in both the cases the minima are not very deep in @xmath157 ( this is particularly the case for cas+csa ) ; * in none of the cases maximal active ",

    "[ chi2_combined].c ) or left unconstrained ( fig .  [",

    "they give a better fit to the combined analysis with a gof of 66%68% . in these cases",
    "the dependence of @xmath188 with the active  sterile admixture is more pronounced and it is dominated by the dependence of the atmospheric neutrino analysis , although there is a secondary minimum at the cas+csa configuration which for the atm+sol@xmath190 case is acceptable at 92% cl . in all these scenarios",
    "mas admixture is ruled out at more than 99% cl .",
    "qualitatively this behaviour arises from the fact that in these scenarios increasing the sterile admixture in the atmospheric pair is strongly disfavoured while it is still acceptable for the solar pair since the sma solution is valid for pure @xmath207 solar oscillations .    on the other hand , the scenarios with the solar solution within the lma region ( fig .  [",
    "chi2_combined].b ) prefer the cas+csa scenario , although the dependence of @xmath188 with the active  sterile admixture is not very strong and it presents a secondary minimum near the complementary situation of close  to  sterile solar plus close  to  active atmospheric ( css+caa ) scenario , which is acceptable at 90% cl .",
    "they give the worst fit to the combined analysis but they still present an acceptable gof : 47.5% ( 56% ) for the `` restricted '' ( unrestricted ) case . in these scenarios",
    "mas admixture is ruled out at 99% cl for the `` restricted '' case and it is acceptable at about 95% cl for the unrestricted one .",
    "this behaviour arises from the fact that in these scenarios increasing the sterile admixture both in the atmospheric pair and in the solar case is strongly disfavoured .",
    "it is precisely in this case that one would expect the combined solution to lie near mas admixture .",
    "however , the results show that it is the solar dependence ( which dominates in the combination ) what leads to the slightly better description for the cas+csa scenario with a secondary minimum at the complementary css+caa scenario .    summarizing , in this paper we have performed a combined analysis of the neutrino oscillation solutions of the solar and atmospheric neutrino problem in the framework of four  neutrino mixing .",
    "such scenarios allow for simultaneous transitions of solar @xmath0 as well as atmospheric @xmath1 into active and sterile neutrinos .",
    "our results show that although the solar and atmospheric data analyzed independently disfavour the pure @xmath4 atmospheric channel and the pure @xmath6 solar channel , the result from the combined analysis still favours close  to  pure active and sterile oscillations either in the solar or in the atmospheric sector ( depending on the selected solar solution ) and disfavours oscillations into a near  maximal active  sterile admixture .",
