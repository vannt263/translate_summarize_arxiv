    "based on theoretical arguments , it has become widely accepted that a significant fraction of galactic cosmic rays with energies up to the `` knee '' in the cosmic ray spectrum at @xmath2  ev are generated in shell type supernova remnants ( snrs ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the detection of non - thermal x - rays from the shells of several snrs provides evidence that snr shocks are efficient accelerators of @xmath3 ev electrons ( see e.g. * ?",
    "* ) , direct evidence is still lacking that ( 1 ) snrs can accelerate particles all the way to @xmath4  ev , and ( 2 ) snrs efficiently accelerate protons and heavy nuclei as well as electrons ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "powerful constraints on shock acceleration in snrs can come from the detection of tev @xmath0-rays .",
    "however , these high energy photons can be produced by a variety of mechanisms , including inverse compton ( ic ) emission from energetic electrons , and pion decay produced by the collision of energetic protons with surrounding dense gas .",
    "additionally , pulsars , pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) , microquasars , and massive stars , have also been suggested as tev counterparts , so it is unclear whether snrs are in fact the primary source of cosmic rays @xmath5  ev .",
    "currently only two convincing shell snr / tev associations are known ( snrs  g347.30.5 and g266.21.2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and observations do not yet unambiguously distinguish between hadronic and leptonic acceleration @xcite .",
    "however , with the advent of new sensitive erenkov imaging telescopes , there are bright prospects for discovering additional tev sources .",
    "indeed , @xcite recently reported the discovery of eight new tev @xmath0-ray sources in the inner galactic plane ( @xmath6 ) using the high energy stereoscopic system ( hess ) .",
    "of the eight new tev sources , six are listed in @xcite as being in close proximity to either an snr , pulsar , or _",
    "egret _ source ( in some cases all three ) . however , these authors were unable to identify any plausible counterparts to two of the new tev sources and suggest that they may represent a new class of `` dark '' nucleonic particle accelerators .    in this",
    "we present evidence that one of the two `` dark '' tev sources , hess  j1813178 , is positionally coincident with a previously unidentified young radio and x - ray snr , g12.80.0 . a simple model for the broadband emission is also presented .",
    "the radio source g12.820.02 was discovered in a new low frequency very large array ( vla ) 90 cm survey incorporating b+c+d configuration data @xcite .",
    "the previously unidentified radio source has a shell morphology with a diameter of @xmath7 .",
    "analysis of archival vla c+d configuration 20 cm data has confirmed this discovery , and indicates that the radio emission is non - thermal .",
    "g12.820.02 has integrated radio flux densities at 20 and 90 cm of @xmath8 and @xmath9 jy , respectively .",
    "figure 1a shows the 90 cm image while figure 1b shows a 3-color image of the region using 90 cm , 20 cm , and 8 @xmath10 m _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "glimpse data @xcite .",
    "it is notable that no distinct ( non - diffuse ) dust emission is coincident with g12.820.02 , confirming its non - thermal nature .",
    "hess  j1813178 ( positional uncertainty @xmath11 ) is coincident with the radio shell ( see fig .",
    "1a ) and its size of @xmath12 is in excellent agreement with that of g12.820.02 .",
    "no structure is evident in the published @xmath13 resolution hess image @xcite .",
    "the radio and tev sources are located @xmath14 from the hii region complex w33 ( see fig .",
    "1a , b ,  3.1 ) .",
    "though not previously recognized as a distinct source , g12.820.02 is evident as a faint unresolved extension to w33 in the nobeyama 3 cm , parkes 6 cm , and bonn 11 cm surveys , with resolutions ranging from @xmath13 to @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the radio spectrum of g12.820.02 ( including the 20 and 90 cm vla data , 4 m vla b+c+d configuration data from @xcite , and the single dish data ) is shown in figure 1c .",
    "the rms noise in the 20 and 90 cm images are 5 and 2.5 mjy  beam@xmath16 , respectively , and the flux density uncertainty is ( @xmath17 independent beams)@xmath18 .",
    "g12.820.02 is not detected at 4 m ; the flux density shown in figure 1c is a @xmath19 upper limit ( also see  3.1 ) . to account for the extra uncertainty due to confusion with w33 ,",
    "@xmath20 was used for the single dish uncertainties . the spectral index using these data ( excluding the 4 m non - detection ) and",
    "a weighted least squares fit is @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 ) , similar to that of other small shell type snrs ( i.e. g349.7 + 0.2 and w49b ) without central pulsars @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath23 , the 1  ghz surface brightness of g12.820.02 is @xmath24 w  m@xmath25  hz  sr@xmath16 , and the radio luminosity from @xmath26 hz is @xmath27  ergs  s@xmath16 ( @xmath28 is the distance and @xmath29  kpc ; see  3.1 ) .",
    "the radio morphology , radio spectrum , and lack of coincident mid - infrared emission ( fig .",
    "1 ) provide convincing evidence that g12.820.02 is a previously unidentified shell type snr ; henceforth designated snr  g12.80.0 .",
    "analysis of a pointed 100 ks archival _",
    "observation toward this region ( taken 1997  september ) reveals a source , hereafter ax  j1813178 , spatially coincident with both snr  g12.80.0 and hess  j1813178 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "ax  j1813178 is detected by both the sis and gis _ asca _ instruments , although the emission is contaminated in the gis detectors by the bright x - ray binary gx  13 + 1 @xmath30 to the ne .",
    "thus , we have confined our spectral and imaging analysis to the sis data with a combined ( screened ) exposure time of @xmath31 ks .",
    "the x - ray source appears to be either unresolved or slightly extended ( fig 2 ) .",
    "the x - ray peak nominally lies interior to the radio shell , but since the _ asca _ pointing uncertainty can be as large as @xmath32 @xcite , the _ asca _ image does not distinguish between x - rays originating from the center ( i.e. a compact object ) or the shell of the snr .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is quite hard , with emission extending to 10 kev and a strong cut - off below 2 kev ; no lines are evident ( inset fig .",
    "thus it is clear that the emission is predominately non - thermal . the background - corrected sis data ( extracted from a @xmath13 source region ) consisting of @xmath33 counts in the energy range 0.510 kev were jointly fit to several absorbed spectral models including a power - law , and 2-component combinations of a power - law plus a ( 1 ) raymond - smith ( rs ) thermal plasma ( with and without the abundances frozen at solar ) , ( 2 ) blackbody , and ( 3 ) bremsstrahlung component . the data quality are such that all of these models give reasonable fits ( reduced @xmath34 ) .",
    "statistically , a power - law plus rs model gives the best fit ( rs @xmath35  kev ) but the improvement is only @xmath36 compared to a power - law alone ; the emission measure of the rs component can not be constrained .",
    "this result suggests that higher quality x - ray data are needed to determine the thermal contribution to the x - ray emission ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "none of the two - component fits yield a significantly different absorbing column or photon index compared to the power law fit alone : @xmath37  cm@xmath25 and @xmath39 . the unabsorbed flux and luminosity of ax  j1813178 from 210  kev are @xmath40  ergs  cm@xmath25  s@xmath16 and @xmath41  ergs  s@xmath16 , respectively .",
    "these parameters are consistent with ax  j1813178 being either a pulsar / pwn or one of a small number of primarily non - thermal x - ray snrs such as g266.21.2 and g347.30.5 .",
    "as mentioned previously , snr  g12.80.0 lies near the line of sight of the w33 hii region / star formation complex .",
    "the radio recombination lines , molecular lines ( including masers ) , and hi gas associated with w33 arise from lsr velocity components at @xmath42 and @xmath43  km  s@xmath16 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "no hi absorption features are evident toward w33 beyond @xmath44 km  s@xmath16 @xcite . since the tangent point velocity is @xmath45 km  s@xmath16 in this direction ( assumes galactic center distance 8.5 kpc and * ? ? ?",
    "* rotation curve ) , w33 must lie at about the @xmath46 km  s@xmath16 near distance of @xmath47 kpc .",
    "similar to w33 , hi absorption spectra from the southern galactic plane survey ( resolution @xmath32 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) toward g12.80.0 show absorption to , but not beyond @xmath44 km  s@xmath16 , although the signal - to - noise is low .",
    "thus , the distance to g12.80.0 is likely to be @xmath48  kpc .",
    "based on the derived radio spectral index ( @xmath49 ) the expected 4 m flux density is @xmath50 jy , suggesting that snr  g12.80.0 should be readily detectable , yet it is not ( fig .  1c ,  2.1 ) .",
    "this discrepancy could be due to the close proximity of w33 if g12.80.0 lies immersed in or behind the hii region due to free - free absorption ( see e.g kassim 1989 ) . in interferometric low frequency images ( @xmath51 mhz ) hii regions can appear in absorption against the resolved out diffuse galactic plane synchrotron emission due to free - free absorption .",
    "w33 is coincident with such a 4 m absorption hole ; its morphology is similar to the diffuse 90 cm and 8 @xmath10 m emission ( fig .",
    "1b ) and extends as far west as g12.80.0 .",
    "thus , free - free absorption is the most natural explanation for the non - detection of g12.80.0 at 4 m , and confirms the hi result that the snr must lie at the distance of or behind w33 .",
    "the high column density derived from the _ asca _  data , @xmath52  cm@xmath25 , also suggests that snr  g12.80.0 lies behind w33 .",
    "along nearby lines of sight , the integrated galactic hi  column density is only @xmath53  cm@xmath25 @xcite , suggesting that a significant discrete source of absorption must be in the foreground to the snr .",
    "co data @xcite indicate that dense gas in the distance range 04  kpc ( much of which is associated with w33 ) contributes a hydrogen column density @xmath54  cm@xmath25 , and can thus account for much of the x - ray absorption .",
    "this further argues for a distance of 4  kpc or greater for snr  g12.80.0 ; we adopt a fiducial minimum distance of 4  kpc ( @xmath55 ) for the remaining discussion",
    ".      the small angular size of snr  g12.80.0 ( @xmath56 ) suggests that it is quite young ; certainly the high extinction toward this region would have prevented its detection optically .",
    "the radius of snr  g12.80.0 is @xmath57 pc .",
    "if the snr is still freely expanding at a speed @xmath58 its age is @xmath59 years ( @xmath60 km  s@xmath16 ) .",
    "shock speeds of @xmath61 km  s@xmath16 are expected from snrs with x - ray synchrotron emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if the distance is 410  kpc , use of the free - expansion age is justified since the swept up mass would still be a small fraction of the ejected mass . at greater distances",
    "the snr is likely to have entered the sedov - taylor phase .",
    "for example , at 20 kpc , the swept up mass is @xmath62 m@xmath63 ( assuming an ambient density @xmath64 @xmath65 and @xmath66 helium abundance ) and the sedov - taylor age is @xmath67 years ( where @xmath68 is the kinetic energy and @xmath69 ergs ) .",
    "thus , independent of distance , if g12.80.0 is expanding into a typical density medium it is very young with representative age estimates in the range 285 - 2,500 years . excluding g12.80.0 , only six shell type galactic snrs with diameters @xmath70 are currently known , undoubtedly due to observational selection effects since many more",
    "are expected @xcite .",
    "our discovery highlights the effectiveness of high resolution and sensitivity low radio frequency surveys in finding young galactic snrs .      although there is excellent positional agreement between the radio , x - ray , and tev emission ( fig .",
    "2 ) , it is currently unclear whether all these components originate from the snr shell or if there is an as yet unidentified associated pulsar or pwn . no central radio nebula or point source",
    "is detected at our current spatial resolution and sensitivity , and there are no known radio pulsars within @xmath71 of the snr @xcite .",
    "this field has been searched for pulsars as part of the parkes multi - beam pulsar survey , to a limiting 1.4  ghz flux density of 0.2 mjy @xcite , corresponding to a pseudo - luminosity of @xmath72  mjy  kpc@xmath73 .",
    "recent deep pulsar searches toward snrs have been able to either detect or place upper limits of @xmath74  mjy  kpc@xmath73 on the 1.4 ghz pseudo - luminosity of central pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the parkes multi - beam survey is reasonably constraining , but a deeper search is needed .",
    "the x - ray luminosity and photon index inferred in  2.2 for ax  j1813178 are typical of young pulsars and their associated pwn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in order to search for x - ray pulsations from ax  j1813178 we conducted a @xmath75 search ( see * ? ? ? * ) on the barycenter - corrected _ asca _ high - bit mode gis data ( with 20 ks of data ) .",
    "no pulsed signal was detected using 585 counts between 48 kev .",
    "for periods between 125  ms and 1000  s , we find an upper limit on the pulsed fraction of @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) for a sinusoidal ( sharply peaked ) pulse profile .",
    "since most young pulsars rotate with periods below this range , and the pulsed signal may be a small fraction ( @xmath78 ) of the total pulsar plus pwn x - ray flux , the lack of pulsations is not very constraining . deeper x - ray and radio observations of this source are needed to confirm or rule out a pulsar / pwn interpretation for ax  j1813178 .",
    "the radio ( snr shell ) and x - ray ( origin uncertain ) data fit smoothly onto a single power - law+rolloff spectrum , unlike the typical behavior of pwn , suggesting they have a common origin ( figure 3 ) . assuming that the radio , x - ray , and tev emission originate from the snr shell , we have modeled the flux expected from synchrotron+ic mechanisms using a power law energy distribution modified by an exponential cutoff @xmath79 $ ] ( where @xmath80 is the index of the electron distribution , and @xmath81 is the maximum energy of accelerated particles , see * ? ? ?",
    "since the x - ray absorption column ( and hence x - ray spectral index ) is not well constrained by the _",
    "data , two variations of this model are shown in figure 3 , one using the best fit x - ray @xmath82 ( red ) and the other using the @xmath83 lower limit to @xmath82 ( blue ) . together",
    "these models encompass the likely range of parameter space .",
    "we have assumed a @xmath84 filling factor for the magnetic field in the ic emitting region in order to obtain the best agreement with the hess data for the ` blue ' model ; larger values yield lower ic components .",
    "the fitted broad - band electron spectral indices are @xmath85 ( red ) and @xmath86 ( blue )  the former is consistent with the best - fit photon index for the _ asca _ spectrum , while the latter is more consistent with the radio spectral index .",
    "the roll - off frequencies ( @xmath87 ) derived from the synchrotron spectra are @xmath88  hz ( red ) and @xmath89  hz ( blue ) .",
    "the maximum energy is related to @xmath87 and the magnetic field strength @xmath90 by @xmath91 hz , so that @xmath92 tev ( red ) and @xmath93 tev ( blue ) . thus , unless the magnetic field strength is much stronger than 10 @xmath10 g ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath81 for this source is potentially rather high ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , for much of the parameter space range , the ic emission from cmb scattering alone is insufficient to account for the hess data ; the discrepancy is larger for larger values of @xmath90 .",
    "it is possible a more sophisticated ic model incorporating scattering off starlight @xcite would better accommodate the hess data .",
    "indeed , @xcite find this to be the case assuming the snr lies at the distance of w33 , though currently it is only constrained to be at or greater than this distance .",
    "it is also possible that the tev emission arises from the acceleration of nuclei and subsequent pion decay instead of ic if the snr is embedded in a sufficiently dense ambient medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "detection of resolved x - ray and tev emission from the snr shell would strengthen our suggestions that the radio , x - ray , and tev emission have the same origin .",
    "higher sensitivity x - ray data will also be crucial to better constrain the properties of the broadband emission .",
