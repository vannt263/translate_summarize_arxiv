    "it has been recognized that orbital degree of freedom plays a crucial role in the emergence of exotic magnetism in strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "the interplay of spin and orbital degrees of freedom triggers off a variety of orbital ordering that stabilizes a certain spin structure on the orbital - ordered background , leading to complex ordered phases , as frequently observed in transition metal oxides and @xmath4-electron compounds .",
    "@xcite    in addition to the appearance of diverse spin - orbital ordered states , the combined quantum effects of spin and orbital degrees of freedom yields a possibility of novel quantum critical and quantum disordered states .",
    "@xcite in this context , a high symmetric su(4 ) exchange model , which describes a spin-1/2 system coupled with a pseudospin-1/2 for two - fold orbital degeneracy , has been one of the intriguing subjects from a theoretical viewpoint .",
    "@xcite in such a high symmetric case , spin , orbital , and combined spin - orbital degrees of freedom play an identical role .",
    "@xcite in particular , the one - dimensional model is bethe ansatz solvable ,  @xcite and the quantum critical behavior of an su(4 ) singlet state has been revealed by analytical and numerical investigations .",
    "@xcite in fact , correlation functions show power - law decay with a critical exponent 3/2 , and the elementary excitation is gapless .",
    "the su(4 ) spin - orbital exchange model represents the strong - coupling limit of a two - orbital hubbard model at quarter filling , in which electrons hop between the same types of orbitals with equal amplitude and the hund s rule coupling is ignored .",
    "indeed , such a simplified model is an appropriate starting point to gain deep insight into the complex quantum fluctuations of spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "however , in actual materials , the highest su(4 ) symmetry is likely to be broken down , thus it is quite important to clarify the effects of possible symmetry breaking .",
    "for instance , intensive studies have been devoted to a one - dimensional su(2)@xmath5@xmath6su(2)@xmath7 exchange model and the ground - state phase diagram has been revealed .",
    "@xcite around the su(4 ) point , a quantum critical phase extends in one side next to the su(4 ) point ,  @xcite while in the other side there occurs a gapped phase , where spin- and orbital - singlet dimers are formed in an alternating pattern .",
    "@xcite    in a more realistic situation , however , the hund s rule coupling causes anisotropic exchange interactions in the orbital part , and the su(4 ) symmetry is broken down to su(2)@xmath5@xmath6u(1)@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite to clarify the effects of such symmetry breaking , an su(4 ) hubbard model perturbed by the hund s rule coupling has been analyzed by means of renormalization - group and bosonization methods .",
    "@xcite it has been proposed that the excitation gap opens for an arbitrarily small hund s rule coupling , while the opening excitation gap is exponentially small as a function of the hund s rule coupling , corresponding to a generalized type of kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "@xcite    on the other hand , it has been common understanding that the hund s rule coupling in multi - orbital systems plays an important role in itinerant ferromagnetism .",
    "@xcite in fact , it has been shown that the hund s rule coupling induces a ground - state transition from a paramagnetic ( pm ) state to a ferromagnetic ( fm ) state in the strong - coupling region ,  @xcite but there , the discussion has been focused on the appearance of ferromagnetism itself and the property of spin and orbital states in the pm phase has not been clear yet .",
    "thus , we believe that it is an intriguing issue to clarify how the su(4 ) singlet state is deformed to a spin- and orbital - singlet state due to the hund s rule coupling .    in this paper , we investigate the ground - state property and the excitation gap of a one - dimensional spin - orbital model with the su(2)@xmath5@xmath6u(1)@xmath7 symmetry , by using numerical techniques .",

    "the hund s rule coupling induces fm and antiferro - orbital ( afo ) interactions , leading to the characteristic change of the peak position of orbital correlation to @xmath1=@xmath3 , while that of spin correlation remains at @xmath1=@xmath2 in the pm phase .",
    "moreover , we observe the stabilization of an orbital dimer state with a significant orbital excitation gap . taking into account the robust orbital dimerization ,",

    "<S> spin and orbital correlations coincide with each other with a peak at @xmath1=@xmath2 , corresponding to the su(4 ) singlet state . on the other hand , spin and orbital states change in a different way due to the hund s rule coupling . with increasing @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> the peak position of orbital correlation changes to @xmath1=@xmath3 , while that of spin correlation remains at @xmath1=@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , orbital dimer correlation becomes robust in comparison with spin dimer correlation , suggesting that quantum orbital fluctuation is enhanced by the hund s rule coupling . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , a relatively large orbital gap opens in comparison with a spin gap , and the system is described by an effective spin system on the background of the orbital dimer state . </S>"
