    "chemical functionalziation is one of the main methods to manipulate the physical and chemical properties of nanoobjects @xcite and to study mechanisms of interaction of the nanoobjects with their environment ( e.g. , to investigate the stability of desired properties with respect to oxidation , hydrogenation , etc . ) .",
    "initially , graphene was used by theoreticians as a simple model to describe properties of nanotubes @xcite . after the discovery of graphene @xcite and of its extraordinary electronic properties @xcite the chemical functionalization of graphene became a focus of especial interest in contemporary chemical physics .",
    "the main motivations of these studies are ( i ) modification of electronic properties via opening the energy gap in the electron spectrum of single- and bilayer graphene @xcite ; ( ii ) potential use of graphene for hydrogen storage @xcite ; ( iii ) decoration of various defects in graphene @xcite ; ( iv ) a way to make graphene magnetic for potential use in spintronics @xcite ; ( v ) search for ways to produce `` cheap graphene '' by chemical reduction of graphite oxide and manipulation of its electronic @xcite and mechanical @xcite properties ; ( vi ) the functionalization of graphene edges in graphene nanoribbons @xcite and their protection @xcite ; ( vii ) oxidation and cracking of graphene @xcite as tools to create graphene nanostructures of a given shape @xcite .",
    "there are two main types of functionalization , namely , a covalent one , with the covalent bond formation , and non - covalent , due to the van der waals forces only .",
    "most of the works deal with the covalent functionalization , and only few of them @xcite treat the non - covalent one which is , of course , not surprising .",
    "first , the covalent functionalziation results in much stronger modification of geometric and electronic structures of graphene .",
    "second , the most of the density functional codes used now do not allow to include the effects of the van der waals interactions @xcite playing a crucial role in the non - covalent functionalization .",
    "in those cases the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite is mostly used , instead of the standard generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite which gives usually rather good results for layer compounds , such as graphite , hexagonal boron nitride and mos@xmath0 , due to error cancellation @xcite .",
    "sometimes , the chemical functionalziation in graphene is related to the ionic chemical bond .",
    "there are the cases of graphene layers in graphite intercalated compounds @xcite and graphene layers at metal surfaces @xcite .",
    "this type of functionalization is important to study possible superconductivity in graphene , by analogy with the superconducting intercalates cac@xmath1 and ybc@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "here we restrict ourselves only by the case of covalent functionalization of graphene .",
    "we will start with the hydrogenation of graphene , as a prototype of chemical functionazliation ( section 3 ) . in section 4 ,",
    "other examples will be considered , including realistic models of the functionalization by diatomic molecules , such as o@xmath0 and hf . in section 5",
    "we will discuss effects of finite width on the functionalization of the graphene nanoribbons ( gnr ) .",
    "we will give a resume of the work and discuss some perspectives in section 5 .",
    "our calculations have been performed with the siesta code @xcite using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite to dft and troullier - martins @xcite pseudopotentials .",
    "we used energy mesh cutoff 400 ry , and @xmath2-point mesh in monkhorst - park scheme @xcite . during the optimization",
    ", the electronic ground states was found self - consistently by using norm - conserving pseudopotentials to cores and a double-@xmath3 plus polarization basis of localized orbitals for carbon , oxygen and fluorine , and double-@xmath3 one for hydrogen .",
    "optimization of the bond lengths and total energies was performed with an accuracy 0.04 ev /  and 1 mev , respectively .    in our study of geometric distortions induced by the chemisorption of single hydrogen atom which will be described below ( section 3 ) a supercell containing 128 carbon atoms with @xmath2-point 4@xmath44@xmath41 mesh",
    "is used . for the cases of maximal coverage of graphene by various chemical species ( section 4 )",
    "the standard elementary cell of graphene with two carbon atoms is used , similar to the case of full hydrogenation @xcite , with @xmath2-point 20@xmath420@xmath42 mesh . to simulate interaction of bulk graphene with hydrofluoric acid the supercell with 8 carbon atoms",

    ", its energy is defined as e@xmath5 = e@xmath6 - e@xmath7 - e@xmath8 , where e@xmath6 and e@xmath7 are the total energies of the system for n - th and n-1-th steps and e@xmath8 is the total energy of the adsorbed molecule .",
    "in contrast with the standard definition of the chemisorption which we used in the previous works , this definition allows to evaluate energy favor or disfavor of each step separately .",
    "we choose e@xmath8 as a total energy of the corresponding molecule in gaseous phase .",
    "this is the most natural choice to estimate stability of chemically modified graphene .",
    "this is the crucial issue , for example , for the case of graphite oxide where the desorption of hydroxy groups in the main obstacle to derive a `` cheap graphene '' @xcite .",
    "note that molecular oxygen exists in both triplet ( spin - polarized ) and singlet ( non - spin - polarized ) states , the former being more energetically favorable by 0.98 ev ( we have found for this energy difference the value 1.12 ev ) .",
    "we will use here , as well as in the previous work @xcite the energy of singlet o@xmath0 ; to obtain the data with respect to magnetic oxygen one needs merely to shift up the presented energies by 1.12 ev . when considering oxidation of nanotubes both energy of singlet @xcite and triplet @xcite oxygen are used .",
    "hydrogenation of carbon nanoobjects is a subject of special interest starting from the discovery of fullerenes @xcite , due to potential relevance of this issue for the hydrogen storage problem and a general scientific importance for chemistry . soon after the synthesis of the first fullerenes theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite works appeared on the minimal hydrogenated fullerene , c@xmath9h@xmath0 .",
    "it was shown in these works that the most stable configuration of hydrogen on the fullerene corresponds to the functionalization of the neighboring carbon atoms ( 1,2 , according to chemical terminology , see fig .",
    "[ c60h2 ] ) .",
    "further investigations result in discovery of numerous systems with larger contents of hydrogen , up to c@xmath9h@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "further hydrogenation of the fullerenes turns out to be impossible , due to their specific geometric structure .",
    "it is important that all known stable compounds c@xmath9h@xmath11 contain even numbers of the hydrogen atoms .",
    "together with other known facts @xcite it allowed to formulate the main principle for the hydrogenation of the fullerenes : hydrogen atoms can be bonded either with the neighboring or with the opposite atoms in carbon hexagons ( 1,2 or 1,4 , in the chemical terminology ) .",
    "another issue of special interest was magnetism of hydrogenated fullerenes caused by unpaired electrons on broken bonds .",
    "this can be realized only for odd numbers of hydrogen atoms per buckyball @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these hydrogenated fullerenes are unstable and observed only as intermediate products of some chemical reactions ; for even numbers of the hydrogen atoms magnetism does not survive and disappears with a time @xcite .",
    "it is worth to note that the hydrogenated fullerenes themselves are quite stable chemically and do not loose hydrogen even under the action of high pressures @xcite .",
    "h@xmath0,width=3 ]    the discovery of single - wall carbon nanotubes @xcite ( further we will discuss only this kind of the nanotubes ) and successful attempts of their reversible hydrogenation @xcite , which makes the nanotubes more prospective materials for hydrogen storage than fullerenes , have inspired numerous theoretical models of the nanotube hydrogenation .",
    "geometric structure of the nanotubes differs essentially from that of the fullerenes .",
    "single - wall carbon nanotubes can be represented as a graphene scroll of length up to few microns and width 1 - 1.5 nm .",
    "importantly , armchair and zigzag nanotubes exist with different structure of the honeycomb net on their surface , and the nanotubes can be chiral which is essential for their chemical functionalization @xcite . to avoid these complications ,",
    "graphene is frequently used to simulate chemical functionalization of the nanotubes @xcite .",
    "however , as was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a curvature radius of typical nanotubes ( 1.0 to 1.5 nm ) is comparable with the radius of geometric distortions induced by hydrogen .",
    "effects of the curvature of nanotubes on the hydrogenation was studied in detail recently @xcite and appeared to be quite essential , the hydrogenation being different in two directions , along and around the nanotubes .",
    "influence of different types of chirality on chemistry of nanotubes and differences with graphene was discussed also in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us discuss briefly the main results of these works .",
    "potential barriers for the cases of adsorption of a single hydrogen atom on graphene and several types of nanotubes , as well as formation of hydrogen chains on graphene and around the nanotubes have been studied in ref .",
    "modification of the electronic structure of perfect graphene and graphene with the stone - wales defect at the adsorption of single hydrogen atom was discussed in ref .",
    "the authors @xcite investigated a relation of magnetism with chemisorption of hydrogen for perfect graphene and for two types of defects , that is , monovacancy and interlayer carbon atom in graphite .",
    "sluiter and kawazoe @xcite used the cluster expansion algorithm to find the most stable configuration for complete coverage of graphene by hydrogen , to model the hydrogenation of nanotubes .",
    "this configuration corresponds to so called graphane which has been studied afterwards by the dft calculations @xcite .",
    "wessely et al @xcite simulated the core level spectra of carbon for the case of chemisorption of single hydrogen atom on graphene , to interpret existing experimental data on hydrogenated nanotubes .",
    "graphene was used also to model the hydrogenation of graphite @xcite . after the discovery of graphene several works have been carried out on the hydrogenation of graphene itself , to modify its physical properties . in ref .",
    "@xcite the chemisorption of single hydrogen atom was studied in more detail than before , as well as interactions of magnetic moments arising , due to unpaired electrons , at the hydrogenation of carbon atoms belonging to the same sublattice ( it was shown that in this case the interaction turns out to be ferromagnetic ) .",
    "at the same time , according to ref .",
    "@xcite the combination of three hydrogen atoms ( two of them belonging to sublattice a and the third one to sublattice b ) remains magnetic which may be important in light of discussions of potential magnetism of carbon systems .",
    "sofo and coworkers @xcite considered theoretically a hypothetic material , graphane , that is , graphite with completely hydrogenated carbon layers ( in each layer , all hydrogen atoms coupled with one sublattice are situated above , and with another sublattice - below the layer ) .",
    "this structure corresponds to weakly coupled diamond - like layers , with sp@xmath12 hybridization , instead of sp@xmath13 in graphite .",
    "this change of hybridization results in opening a gap of order 3 ev in electron energy spectrum , due to a transformation of @xmath14 and @xmath15 orbitals to @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( see fig . [ bands ] ) .",
    "the cohesive energy was found to be relatively small ( of order 0.4 ev per hydrogen atom ) which allows to make the process of hydrogenation reversible @xcite .",
    "roman and coworkers @xcite considered different configurations of hydrogen on graphene for the case of one - side hydrogenation and have found that configurations when hydrogen atoms are bonded with different sublattices ( similar to fig .",
    "[ sublatt]c ) are the most stable . in our work",
    "@xcite some general principles of hydrogenation of graphene have been formulated based on calculations for various configurations in a broad range of coverage .",
    "( color online),width=3 ]    carbon atoms in graphene are in the sp@xmath13 hybridization state when each carbon atom has three @xmath16 and one @xmath14 orbitals ( fig .",
    "[ bands ] ) .",
    "in contrast with numerous polyaromatic hydrocarbons with localized single- and double bonds @xmath14-orbitals in graphene are delocalized and all conjugated chemical bonds are equivalent .",
    "chemisorption of hydrogen atom means a break of one of the @xmath14 bonds and transformation from sp@xmath13 to sp@xmath12 hybridization . at the same time , unpaired electron , one of those forming the @xmath14-bond , remains at the neighboring carbon atoms .",
    "this electron is smeared in one of the sublattices ( figs .",
    "[ dist]b and [ dist]a ) and forms a magnetic moment .",
    "the distribution of spin density in a radius of 1 nm correlates with distortions of the crystal lattice ( fig .",
    "[ dist]b ) . however , this situation is not robust in a sense that the chemisorption of the next hydrogen atom bonds this unpaired electron and kills the magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "thus , the first principle of the chemical functionalization is the absence of unpaired electrons , or , in other words , of dangling bands . as a consequence of this principle , chemisorption of functional groups on different sublattices",
    "are much more energetically favorable than on the same sublattice .",
    "( color online),width=3 ]     ( color online),width=3 ]    the next principle is a minimization of geometric frustrations .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ dist]b that the chemisorption of single hydrogen atom results in essential atomic displacements inside a circle of radius 5    ( two periods of graphene crystal lattice ) and in smaller but still noticeable distortions with a characteristic radius 10    ( fig . [ radii ] ) .",
    "the chemisorption of single hydrogen atom leads to a strong shift up of the carbon atom bonded with the hydrogen and shifts down for two neighboring atoms .",
    "it is worth to notice that if one fixes positions of all carbon atoms except nearest and next - nearest neighbors of the central atom @xcite it changes essentially the picture of atomic displacements",
    ". such a procedure may be reasonable to simulate chemical functionalization for constrained systems such as graphene on graphite @xcite , ru @xcite , ir @xcite and pt @xcite where part of graphene lattice is strongly coupled with the substrate .",
    "chemisorption of the next hydrogen atom is more favorable when it results in minimal additional distortions .",
    "this means that the most energetically stable configuration arises if two hydrogen atoms are chemisorbed by neighboring carbon atoms at different sides of graphene sheet .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ dist]b that in this case no essential additional atomic shifts are necessary . if only one side is available for the chemisorption the most favorable configuration of two hydrogen atoms is the bonding with carbon atoms in the opposite corners of the hexagon in honeycomb lattice ( cites 1,4 , or para - position , according to the chemical terminology ) @xcite . for the case of two more distant hydrogen atoms they should migrate to this optimal position overcoming some potential barriers @xcite which was observed experimentally for both graphite @xcite and graphene @xcite .",
    "these two principles of the chemical functionalization predict that in the most stable configuration for hydrogen pair on graphene the hydrogen atoms will sit on neighboring carbon atoms at the opposite sides with respect to the graphene sheet .",
    "due to geometric distortions a region of radius 5    around the pair is more chemically active than pure graphene , similar to the case of graphene with defects @xcite and , thus , next hydrogen atoms will be chemisorbed near the pair . in the case of graphene with defects",
    "this process involves some potential barriers whereas for ideal infinite graphene it will proceed without any obstacles , up to complete hydrogenation and formation of graphane .    in further works @xcite the results @xcite on stability of nonmagnetic pairs of hydrogen on graphene and on the formation energies",
    "have been confirmed , also the case of polyaromatic hydrocarbons c@xmath18h@xmath19 @xcite and c@xmath20h@xmath21 @xcite and c@xmath22h@xmath23 @xcite being considered .",
    "recent paper @xcite dealing with adsorption and desorption of biphenyl on graphene demonstrates importance of step by step simulation of the chemical reaction .",
    "it is instructive to compare peculiarities of chemical functionalization of graphene and carbon nanotubes .",
    "similar to graphene , in nanotubes the most favorable place for chemisorption of the second hydrogen atom belongs to the opposite sublattice with respect to the first one @xcite .",
    "there is no direct experimental evidences of this structure for the case of hydrogen , however , for another functional groups it is known that normally they are attached to pairs of neighboring carbon atoms @xcite .",
    "minimization of geometric frustrations plays an important role also in the case of nanotubes .",
    "in contrast with flat graphene , a particular shape of the nanotubes makes the chemisorption from external side more favorable , with the adsorbed pairs situated along the nanotube . for large enough groups",
    "they are usually attached to the opposite sides of the nanotube cross section @xcite , again , to minimize the carbon net distortions .",
    "in contrast with graphene where complete _ one - side _ hydrogenation is unfavorable for the case of nanotubes it turns out to be possible , from external side , as is shown both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , graphane is not very stable which is actually quite good from the point of view of hydrogen storage since it allows to hydrogenate and dehydrogenate graphene at realistic temperatures @xcite . at the same time , for potential use of graphane in electronics this can be considered as a shortcoming .",
    "therefore it is interesting to consider other functional groups to search a compound with the electronic structure similar to graphane but larger cohesive energy .",
    "groups ( optimized atomic positions ) .",
    "carbon and hydrogen atoms are shown in green and white , respectively .",
    "[ ch3 ] ( color online),width=3 ]    the computational results are presented in table [ tab1 ] and in fig .",
    "[ ch3 ] . based on them one can divide all the functional groups in two classes , ( a ) with the energy gap of order 3 ev and large enough cohesive energy and ( b ) with much weaker bonding and much smaller energy gap , or without a gap at all .",
    "this difference can be related with the length of chemical bonds between carbon atoms ( carbon - carbon distance ) .",
    "for the substances from the first class it is almost equal to that in diamond , 1.54    whereas for the substances from the second class it is larger .",
    "this means that for the latter case , due to mutual repulsion of the functional groups , graphene is destabilized which diminishes the cohesive energy .",
    "this situation is observed experimentally in graphite oxide which can not be completely functionalized due to interaction between hydroxy groups @xcite , in agreement with the xps data @xcite .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as examples of chemical species which can provide , similar to hydrogen , a complete coverage of graphene , we will consider f@xmath0 , hf and hcl .",
    "fluorine seems to be very promising for the functionalization of graphene since it should produce a very homogeneous structure , with a complete coverage by atoms of the same kind .",
    "therefore , this might be a way to create a two - dimensional crystal with rather large energy gap but high electron mobility , due to small degree of disorder .",
    "however , fluorine is very toxic and very aggressive which may be a problem for industrial use .",
    "also , fluorine is used for ripping of nanotubes @xcite which means that , potentially , edges and defects of graphene lattice interacting with the fluorine can be centers of its destruction .",
    "actually , graphene samples are always rippled @xcite or can be deformed as observed for graphene ribbons @xcite .",
    "let us consider now , step by step , interaction of graphene with inorganic acids hf and hcl . the process of functionalization of graphene by hf starts with the chemisorption of fluorine and hydrogen atoms at neighboring carbon sites at the same side of graphene sheet ( fig .",
    "[ hfbulk ] ) .    as a first step of chemisorption of hydrofluoric acid molecule we consider bonding of hydrogen and fluorine atoms with the neighboring carbon atoms at the same side of graphene sheet ( fig .",
    "[ hfbulk]a ) .",
    "in contrast with molecular fluorine where the chemisorption energy is negative ( see above ) the energy of this step turns out to be positive , + 1.46 ev , mainly , due to strong distortions of initially flat graphene at the one - side functionalization . as the next step",
    ", we consider chemisorption of one more h - f pair from another side of graphene ( fig .",
    "[ hfbulk]b ) .",
    "similar to chemisorption of the second hydrogen atom ( see above ) this step is energetically favorable , with the formation energy -1.85 ev .",
    "reconstruction to the structure shown in fig .",
    "[ hfbulk]c diminishes the total energy by 0.33 ev which makes this a possible third step of the process under consideration .",
    "after that , the chemisorption energy of third hf molecule turns out to be much smaller than for the first one but still positive , + 0.27 ev ( fig . [ hfbulk]d ) . starting from the fourth molecule , the chemisorption energies are negative so further reaction is exothermal . as a result , complete coverage of graphene by hydrofluoric",
    "acid is energetically favorable but requires high enough energy for the first step .",
    "this means that , the most probably , bulk graphene without defects will be stable enough with respect to reaction with hf , at least , at room temperature and normal pressure .",
    "it seems to be practically important since hydrofluoric acid is used to solvate sio@xmath0 substrate when prepare freely hanged graphene membrane @xcite .",
    "one can expect in this case a formation of a chemically modified layer near edges with essentially different electronic structure ( see below ) .",
    "( color online),width=3 ]    our calculations show that the first step of functionalization of graphene by hydrochloric acid is essentially different , due to larger interatomic distance ( 1.27   for hcl pair , instead of 0.97    for hf ) which close to carbon - carbon distance in graphene ( 1.42  ) . as a result",
    ", there is no break of bonds between hydrogen and chlorine but , instead , hcl molecule hangs over graphene layer bonding with it by only weak van - der - waals bond and there is no chemical reaction .",
    "thus , the hydrocloric acid can be safely used to clean graphene .",
    "( color online),width=3 ]    let us consider now , using oxygen molecule as an example , a chemisorption of diatomic molecule with _",
    "double _ chemical bond . in this case , at the first step the double bond will transform into the single one , with formation of single bonds with neighboring carbon atoms ( fig .",
    "[ oxo ] ) .",
    "this reaction requires to overcome some energy barrier which is , however , rather low since flexibility of graphene allows to minimize the energy costs due to lattice distortions .",
    "bilayer graphene is much less flexible @xcite , due to interlayer coupling , which makes the chemisorption energy higher , in agreement with the experimental data @xcite .    if we would calculate chemisorption energy with respect to not singlet but triplet state of o@xmath0 molecules it would increase all chemisorption energies by 1.12 ev ( see section 2 ) .",
    "the resulting energies are so high that it seems in contradiction with the experimental fact that graphene is relatively easily oxidized already at temperature up to 200 @xcite . also ,",
    "`` unzipping '' process at the oxidation of graphite observed experimentally @xcite will involve energetically unstable states .",
    "graphene oxide turns out to be also unstable with respect to triplet oxygen @xcite .",
    "probably these discrepancies mean that formation of singlet oxygen plays some role in these processes .",

    "oxidation energy for graphene turns out to be lower than for the case of nanotubes @xcite . in the latter case ,",

    ".    previous computational results for oxidation of graphene @xcite are qualitatively similar to ours . however , the energy of cyclo - addition there is higher than ours .",
    "there are two possible reasons for this difference , the use of lda in ref .",
    "@xcite instead of gga in our calculation and the use of relatively small graphene `` molecule '' ( with 64 atoms ) instead of infinite system with periodic conditions here .",

    "to compare , we have calculated also energy costs of direct reduction ( e.g. , by heating ) .",
    "one can see from the figure that for high degrees of coverage of go ( weakly reduced ) energy costs of chemical reactions are smaller than those of the direct reduction whereas for the case of strongly reduced go , vice versa , direct total reduction turns out to be more energetically favorable . similar , other reactions of real @xcite and potential functionalization of go can be simulated which may be important to search ways of its complete reduction to pure graphene .",

    "one can see , that , similar to the case of hydrogenation @xcite ( see also the previous section ) gnr are very chemically active which probably means that , at least , some of their applications will require an inert atmosphere .",
    "in section 3 we discussed , using hydrogenation as example , three main principles of chemical functionalization of graphene : ( i ) broken bonds are very unfavorable energetically and , therefore , magnetic states on graphene are usually very unstable ; ( ii ) graphene is very flexible , and atomic distortions influence strongly on the chemisorption process ; ( iii ) the most stable configurations correspond to 100% coverage for two - side functionalization @xcite and 25% coverage for one - side functionalization @xcite . based on these principles one can model the functionalization of not only perfect graphene @xcite but",
    "also graphene with intrinsic and extrinsic defects which are centers of chemical activity @xcite .",
    "in section 4 we have studied chemical functionalization of graphene by fluorine and hydrofluoric acids .",
    "they can provide complete coverage and , thus , semiconducting state with large enough electron energy gap and weak disorder .",
    "alternatively , non - covalent functionalization can be used to create the gap .",
    "the current situation seems to be a bit controversial . in some papers @xcite an energy gap opening due to physisorption of various molecules",
    "has been found , in contrast with other results @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to compare these works directly since they are , in general , done for different chemical species and their concentrations .",
    "however , keeping in mind that in some cases @xcite the same case of water has been studied one can conclude that the electronic structure is very sensitive to specific concentration and specific geometric configuration of water on graphene surface . at the same time , one should keep in mind that a very specific structure of water @xcite and other hydrogen - bonded substances may be not very accurately reproduced in the dft calculations .",
    "probably , only combination of the dft , quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics can clarify the situation .",
    "anyway , since the cohesive energy at physisorption does not exceed 20 kj / mol the physisorbed graphene can not be very robust which may result in some restrictions of its use in electronics .",
    "we have demonstrated using hf as an example that it is important to simulate the chemisorption process step by step since it allows to estimate accurately chemisorption energies relevant for each step of the process .",
    "it turns out that for perfect infinite graphene the energy cost of first step for the case of hf is rather high whereas for hcl this reaction is practically impossible .",
    "this means that these acids can be safely used for cleaning of graphene samples . at the same time",
    ", the potential barrier for the oxidation is rather low which makes even moderate annealing of graphene in oxygen - contained atmosphere not very safe procedure .",
    "we have shown also , in the last section , that the graphene nanoribbons are chemically active enough to be oxidized and to interact with hydrofluoric acid with relatively low activation energy .",
    "it means that to prepare the graphene nanoribbons with a given chemical composition alternative ways should be used , e.g. , its synthesis from polyaromatic hydrocarbons @xcite or even use microorganisms as it is used already for biogenic grow @xcite and cleaning @xcite .",
