    "an important milestone in the evolution of the universe is the appearance of the first luminous objects , which begins the era of heating and ionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , referred to as cosmic reionization .",
    "a promising probe of the cosmic gas up to the end of reionization is the hyperfine spin - flip transition of neutral hydrogen ( h  i ) at a wavelength of 21-cm .",
    "observations of the redshifted 21-cm power spectrum as a function of wavelength and angular position can provide a three - dimensional map of the h  i distribution @xcite .    the 21-cm line of the hydrogen atom results from the transition between the triplet and singlet hyperfine levels of the ground state .",
    "calculations of 21-cm absorption begin with the spin temperature @xmath0 , defined through the ratio between the number densities of hydrogen atoms , @xmath1 , where subscripts @xmath2 and @xmath3 correspond to the excited and ground state levels of the 21-cm transition and @xmath4  k corresponds to the energy difference between the levels .",
    "the 21-cm spin temperature is on the one hand radiatively coupled to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature @xmath5 , and on the other hand coupled to the kinetic gas temperature @xmath6 through collisions @xcite or the absorption of photons , as discussed below . for the concordance set of cosmological parameters @xcite ,",
    "the mean brightness temperature on the sky at redshift @xmath7 ( relative to the cmb itself ) is @xmath8\\ , \\bar{x}_{\\rm hi}\\,$ ] @xcite where @xmath9 is the mean neutral fraction of hydrogen .",
    "after cosmic recombination , down to @xmath10 the remaining free electrons kept @xmath6 close to @xmath5 .",
    "afterward , the gas cooled adiabatically and atomic collisions kept the spin temperature @xmath0 coupled to @xmath6 , both of them lower than @xmath5 , thus creating a 21-cm signal in absorption . as the universe continued to expand and rarefy the gas ,",
    "the radiative coupling between @xmath5 and @xmath0 started to dominate again , and the 21-cm signal faded .",
    "starting at @xmath11 @xcite , the uv photons from the first galaxies emitted between the and lyman limit wavelengths propagated freely in the igm .",
    "they redshifted or scattered into the resonance , thus coupling @xmath0 to @xmath6 through the wf effect @xcite whereby atoms re - emitting photons can de - excite into either of the hyperfine states .",
    "fluctuations in the radiation emitted by the first galaxies led to fluctuations in the 21-cm signal @xcite , until the wf effect saturated ( i.e. , finished dropping @xmath0 to @xmath6 ) .",
    "in particular , the biased fluctuations in the number density of galaxies , combined with poisson fluctuations in the number of galaxies and the @xmath12 dependence of the flux , caused large fluctuations in the background .",
    "this background is composed of two parts , the photons that directly redshift into the resonance , and those produced during the atomic cascade from higher lyman series photons ( and above ) . about @xmath13 of the total number of photons emitted from the first stars between and the lyman limit",
    "are converted to @xcite .",
    "the 21-cm power spectrum that arises from the fluctuations in the background can be used to probe the first sources of light and their effect on the igm @xcite .    in this _",
    "letter _ we focus on two effects that have not previously been included in calculations of statistics of the 21-cm brightness temperature ; these effects dramatically influence the flux fluctuations and therefore the 21-cm power spectrum .",
    "the first is the diffusion of photons through the neutral hydrogen gas .",
    "since the optical depth of is around a million , photons scattered on the surrounding gas cause each source to appear as a halo in the sky rather than a point source @xcite . in the absence of scattering",
    "a photon will redshift to at some distance from the source , but in the presence of scattering the emitted photons scatter back and forth and thus reach much closer to the source @xcite .",
    "thus , the flux that a random point in the universe observes is dominated by nearby sources . as a result ,",
    "the fluctuations in the flux are larger and enhance the 21-cm power spectrum .",
    "the second effect is caused by the presence of ionized hydrogen ( h  ii ) around each source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this region photons can redshift below the resonance without encountering h  i , and thus not participate in the wf effect .",
    "thus , a typical h atom ( which by definition is not within an h  ii region ) receives no photons from sources closer than the typical size of an h  ii bubble .",
    "since galaxy number fluctuations below this scale do not contribute to fluctuations , we expect a cutoff in the 21-cm power spectrum around this scale .",
    "our calculations are made in a @xmath14cdm universe matching observations @xcite , with a power spectrum normalization @xmath15 , hubble constant @xmath16 , and density parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 for matter , cosmological constant , and baryons , respectively .",
    "we assume a uniform neutral igm that exhibits pure hubble expansion around a steady point source @xcite .",
    "the surrounding igm , mainly h  i , is optically thick to the uv radiation that the source emits .",
    "we use a monte - carlo method for the scattering @xcite , for photons of various initial frequencies between and the lyman limit .",
    "the scattering redistributes the distances at which the photons transform to ly@xmath20 , affecting strongly the photons originally emitted between and . due to flux conservation",
    ", the enhancement of the flux at small scales ( by up to a factor of @xmath21 compared to the optically thin case ) is balanced by a steep drop on large scales ( where @xmath22ly@xmath23 ) .",
    "photons produced via cascading from photons emitted above are much less affected ( see below ) , but we fully include these cascades assuming that the resulting photons are emitted at the line center @xcite",
    ". we account for several features that substantially affect the redistribution of photons compared to previous calculations that gave a divergent @xmath24 enhancement near the source @xcite .",
    "first , we explicitly include the h  ii region around each source , which results in enhanced scattering just outside the h  ii region ; the enhancement has a shallower rise to a peak value and then drops to zero right near the h  ii region , because of the loss of photons that are scattered back into the h  ii region .",
    "second , each hydrogen atom receives photons from sources with an effective spectrum that drops sharply at frequencies approaching ly@xmath23 ; photons at such frequencies are emitted by time - retarded sources that formed in a universe with fewer galaxies , effectively reducing the emission rate ( see also section  4 below ) .",
    "we find that scattering strongly enhances this drop in the spectrum",
    ". finally , we also account for the variation of the hubble constant with redshift , which substantially affects the photons emitted at @xmath22ly@xmath23 .",
    "following @xcite we define a dimensionless variable @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the radius for which redshifting a photon due to hubble expansion would produce a frequency with a remaining optical depth of unity ( from there out to infinity , in the direction away from the line center ) . for example , using the standard cosmological parameters , @xmath27 1 mpc ( physical ) , independent of redshift ( for a source at high redshift : @xcite ) . in figure",
    "[ ratio ] we show the ratio between the flux of the source as a result of our calculation as described above and the flux for the case with no redistribution due to scattering , i.e. , where the photons simply redshift until they are absorbed at line center . for photons emitted between and we have plotted the ratio as a function of the variable @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the radius at which an emitted photon redshifts all the way to ly@xmath20 , and the various radii are expressed in units of @xmath26 . at @xmath30 , @xmath31 comoving mpc and @xmath32 comoving mpc . showing the results as a function of the variable @xmath33 provides a better view of the behavior of the flux very near to the h  ii region .",
    "we have considered in this figure a population ii spectrum source , i.e. , we approximated the emissivity within this frequency region as @xmath34 , where for population ii @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "we have also performed the calculation for a spectrum appropriate for population iii stars ( see below ) . for photons cascading from higher - order lyman lines",
    ", the atomic constants would make the enhancement occur much closer to the h  ii region edge ; e.g. , even for ly@xmath36 , @xmath37 comoving mpc , @xmath38 comoving mpc , and a substantial enhancement occurs only at @xmath39 ( with the corresponding definition of @xmath33 for ly@xmath36 ) , well within the thickness of the partial ionization shell of the h  ii region , where the flux is in practice strongly suppressed .     at @xmath30 .",
    "we consider an h  ii region of size 0.023 , 0.23 , and 2.3 comoving mpc ( open squares , triangles , and crosses , respectively ) .",
    "assuming population ii stars , the filled squares ( light green ) are for the case of a simple power - law spectrum ( with @xmath40 mpc ) , while the other curves assume the correct effective spectrum with time - retarded sources .",
    "for the effective spectrum , the flux is low at large distances , so the scattering ( which conserves the total photon number ) must lower this flux especially strongly in order to compensate for the enhancement at small distances.,width=317 ]",
    "in general , fluctuations in @xmath41 can be sourced by fluctuations in the gas density , temperature , neutral fraction , radial velocity gradient , and flux from galaxies .",

    "we denote by @xmath68 and @xmath69 the power spectra of the fluctuations in baryon density and in the flux , respectively , and the power spectrum @xmath70 as the fourier transform of their cross - correlation function @xcite .",
    "the 21-cm power spectrum can then be written in the form @xmath71 where each of the three @xmath72 coefficients can be separately measured from their different @xmath72 dependence @xcite .",

    "we summarize here the calculation of the flux @xcite .",

    "photons above the energy redshift until they reach the nearest atomic level @xmath78 .",
    "the neutral igm is opaque even to the higher levels and so the photon is repeatedly scattered , with a @xmath79 chance of being downgraded to a photon and continuing to scatter , except that the chance is zero for a photon @xcite . to be seen at the resonance at @xmath7",
    ", the photon must have been emitted below a maximal redshift @xmath80 .",
    "the intensity is then @xcite : @xmath81 where absorption at level @xmath78 at redshift @xmath7 corresponds to an emitted frequency @xmath82 at @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is the photon emissivity .",
    "we have included the factor @xmath85 @xcite which is the fraction of photons absorbed at level @xmath78 that are eventually recycled into photons in their subsequent cascade .",
    "the new correction factor @xmath86 is the overall factor by which the flux is changed due to the scattering - induced redistribution of photons that are emitted with frequencies between levels @xmath78 and @xmath87 from sources at a comoving distance @xmath88 from the final destination at redshift @xmath7 ( where @xmath88 is a function of @xmath7 and @xmath83 ) . also new to calculations of the 21-cm power spectrum",
    "is the lower limit of the integral ( @xmath89 ) , which accounts for the h  ii regions ; in order to receive photons from sources closer than the typical size of an h  ii region , an h atom would have to be inside an h  ii bubble  a contradiction .",
    "as mentioned above , there are two separate sources of fluctuations in the flux @xcite .",
    "the first is density inhomogeneities .",
    "since gravitational instability proceeds faster in overdense regions , the biased distribution of rare galactic halos fluctuates much more than the global dark matter density @xcite . when the number of sources seen by each atom is relatively small",
    ", poisson fluctuations provide a second source of fluctuations , statistically independent of the first source to linear order . unlike typical poisson noise",
    ", these fluctuations are correlated between gas elements at different places , since two nearby elements see many of the same sources , though at different distances @xcite .",
    "note that although each hydrogen atom receives some flux from sources as far away as 300 comoving mpc , the fluctuations in flux are actually relatively large because a significant portion of the flux comes from nearby sources .",
    "due to the geometrical dependence of the flux , the perturbation in the flux due to biased density fluctuations is a linear functional of the underlying density fluctuation field , i.e. , the resulting contribution to @xmath90 is related to the fourier transform of the total density perturbation @xmath91 by multiplication by an effective window function @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "the total density perturbation is defined as the mass - weighted mean of the dark matter and baryon perturbations ; we also define @xmath93 } \\equiv \\td_{\\rm tot}/\\td_b$ ] . under the conditions considered in this paper",
    ", the three observable power spectra ( eq .  [ powtb ] ) can be used to study separately the two sources of fluctuations .",
    "in particular , the quantity p_flux-(k ) p_^2- p_^4 = 2 r _ [ : ] _ r_[:_b ] ( k ) p__b(k ) [ eq : pflux ] is proportional to the biased - density contribution to @xmath74 , while @xmath94 equals the poisson contribution to @xmath74 except for a factor of @xmath95 .",
    "the coupling of the spin temperature to the kinetic temperature through the wf effect requires a relatively low cosmic background , and is expected to occur well before the end of cosmic reionization @xcite .",
    "we illustrate our results assuming that the coupling transition achieves @xmath49 at @xmath30 ; this requirement determines the star formation efficiency .",
    "we assume that galaxies form within all dark matter halos above some minimum mass ( or , equivalently , a minimum circular velocity @xmath96 in terms of the virial radius @xmath97 ) .",
    "we consider a wide range of possible values : galaxies that form through molecular hydrogen cooling ( @xmath98 km / s ) , atomic cooling ( @xmath99 km / s ) , or a minimum mass ten times larger ( @xmath100 km / s ) due to feedback effects in low - mass halos .",
    "we consider a single h  ii region size ( calculated as having the flux - weighted mean volume ) ; this size is affected by the fraction @xmath101 of stellar ionizing photons that escape into the igm , and by the stellar population .",
    "we consider two extremes , a stellar initial mass function as observed locally ( pop ii ) or that expected for the very first stars ( pop iii ; 100 solar mass , zero - metallicity stars ) .    in figure  [ ps ] we show in two representative cases the two separately - measurable power spectrum terms that are due to flux fluctuations arising from biased density fluctuations ( @xmath102 ) or from poisson fluctuations ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "each term ( @xmath104 or @xmath105 ) starts small on large scales and rises with @xmath106 , forming a peak before dropping ( and then oscillating ) on the scale of the h  ii region .",
    "scattering modifies @xmath105 more substantially than @xmath104 , since the former is more strongly dominated by fluctuations on small scales .",
    "note that our assumption of a single h  ii region size is reasonable since galaxies at these redshifts are rare and almost all lie in halos close to the minimum halo mass .",
    "also , sufficiently early on in reionization , galaxy clustering plays a relatively minor role in determining bubble sizes . in particular , in the cases shown in figure  [ ps ]",
    ", the cosmic ionized fraction is @xmath107 , and bubbles of sizes between the minimum size ( that of a single - source bubble ) and twice that size contain most of the ionized volume [ 2/3 for @xmath99 km / s , and 1/2 for @xmath100 km / s , using the @xcite model ] .",
    "while the small - scale ringing seen in figure  [ ps ] may be smoothed out by a mild scatter in h  ii region sizes , the overall shape and in particular the peak of each power spectrum term are robustly determined .",
    "( shown in terms of the brightness temperature fluctuation ) as a function of the comoving wavenumber @xmath106 .",
    "we consider @xmath104 ( top panels ) and @xmath108 ( bottom panels ) .",
    "we compare the previous result @xcite ( short - dashed curves ) and the result corrected to use the precise density and temperature power spectra @xcite ( long - dashed curves ) to the full calculation with the h  ii region cutoff ( solid curves , with negative portions dotted and shown in absolute value ; the higher curve of each pair also includes the redistribution of photons due to scattering ) .",
    "we consider galactic halos with a minimum circular velocity @xmath109 km / s ( left panels ) or 35.5 km / s ( right panels ) , assuming pop ii stars with @xmath110 .",
    ", width=317 ]    we summarize the main features of the two power spectra through the peak positions ( @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) and heights ( @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) .",
    "now , since the flux term would have a peak even without the h  ii region cutoff @xcite , the characteristics of its peak are fairly insensitive to the h  ii region size ; thus , we also consider the position of its cutoff , specifically the lowest @xmath106 value ( above @xmath111 ) where the power spectrum drops to 1 mk : @xmath115 .",
    "both @xmath116 and @xmath117 essentially measure the size @xmath118 of the h  ii region ( figure  [ mf ] ) .",
    "in particular , the product @xmath119 and @xmath120 , each to within a factor of 1.5 over a range of three orders of magnitude of @xmath121 . on the other hand ,",
    "the position and height of the peak of @xmath104 are relatively insensitive to @xmath118 and thus observing them would constitute a clear consistency check with the theory .",
    "the poisson peak height @xmath114 measures the average number density of galaxies and thus depends mainly on the minimum mass of galactic halos .",
    "( dashed curves ) , @xmath116 ( solid curves ) , and @xmath122 ( dotted curves ) , as well as ( bottom panel ) @xmath113 ( dashed curves ) and @xmath123 ( dotted curves ) ; see text for definitions .",
    "these curves are the result of a sweep of the parameter space , made in six segments each of which varies @xmath101 from 1@xmath124 thus covering a range of h  ii region sizes shown by one of the horizontal bars ( bottom panel ) : @xmath125 km / s with pop ii stars or pop iii stars , @xmath99 km / s with pop ii or iii , and @xmath100 km / s with pop ii or iii stars , from left to right.,width=317 ]    we note that if significant x - ray heating happened to occur simultaneously with the coupling transition , then similar fluctuations in the x - ray flux from galaxies would generate 21-cm fluctuations that are even somewhat larger @xcite ; while not included in previous studies , the x - ray fluctuations should similarly be enhanced by scattering and should also show a cutoff at the h  ii bubble scale . while x - ray heating could possibly occur early , heating is insignificant except after the coupling fully saturates @xcite .",
    "the five quantitative characteristics we have focused on typically occur at relatively large scales  a fraction of a mpc , or @xmath126 arcseconds at @xmath30  and correspond to relatively large ( but still linear ) fluctuations : 110 mk on a mean background of @xmath127 mk .",
    "thus , the predictions are theoretically robust , and require observational capabilities only somewhat beyond those of the radio arrays being currently constructed . given current capabilities , 21-cm cosmology is the most promising method for firmly detecting and studying the properties of some of the earliest galaxies that ever formed .",
