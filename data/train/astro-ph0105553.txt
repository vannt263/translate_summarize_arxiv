    "[ fig : lvg]b shows that model predicts for a rather wide range of h@xmath4 densities and cn column densities , line intensity ratios around 1.5 ( see table 1 ) . even for the case of optically thick emission with opacities between 1 and 5 the predicted value of rf32 will be of @xmath43",

    "the thickness of the molecular layer in the trapezium region is @xmath80 times smaller than the thickness of the ridge .",
    "the small thickness of the cn emission toward the trapezium region makes it very unlikely that this emission arises from condensations with spherical geometry as for the ridge , since this geometry would require condensations with sizes of only @xmath81 . to explain the observed cn line intensities one would require a large number of these condensations filling the telescope beam .",
    "since the cn emission is extended we conclude that the cn emission in the trapezium region arises from a thin , @xmath8 cm , layer of dense ( few @xmath82@xmath6 ) molecular gas ( hereafter the trapezium molecular layer ) .",

    "the geometry of the trapezium molecular layer , and the chemistry , with large cn abundance as compared with other molecules like hc@xmath41n , confirms that the cn emission is related with the material which confines the rear side of orion a. the presence of a layer of material behind the trapezium confining the orion a h@xmath9ii region is required to explain the kinematics of the ionized gas ( zuckerman , 1973 ) .",

    ", the rear side of the h@xmath9ii region must be confined by a dense layer of gas and dust .",
    "this is confirmed by the radial velocities of o@xmath9i and h@xmath9i . both the atomic layer probed by o@xmath9i and h@xmath9i and the molecular layer probed by cn show velocities close to 9@xmath9km@xmath9s@xmath83 , the ambient cloud velocity , suggesting that this neutral gas forms the front face of the neutral confining cloud ( odell et al .",

    "at the opposite side of the ionization from the dense and warm molecular layer will be surrounding by an envelope of molecular and atomic material ( see van der wef & goss 1989 ) .",
    "the origin of the thin confining layer in the trapezium and its present morphology is unclear since the evolution of h@xmath9ii regions is far from understood ( see e.g. churchwell 1990 ) .",

    "the first possibility is unlikely since the uv radiation seems to dominate the chemistry of the thin molecular layer indicating small visual extinction ( @xmath87mag ) between the ionizing front and the molecular layer ( rodrguez@xmath68franco et al .",
    "1998 ) . furthermore , the line widths of the cn are broader than those found for the ridge , revealing a kinematic interaction between the h@xmath9ii region and the trapezium molecular layer . if the trapezium molecular layer is indeed interacting with the h@xmath9ii region , the lack of velocity shifts between co ( from the bulk of the ridge ) and cn from the trapezium layer indicates that the h@xmath9ii region is not expanding away from the observer .",
    "the trapezium molecular layer would therefore indicate that the presence of `` static '' layers not only occurs at the early phases of the evolution of the h@xmath9ii regions as shown by wood & churchwell ( 1989 ) , but also in more evolved objects .",
