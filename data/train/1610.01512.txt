    "since its publication in 1915 , the main theory of gravitation , the general relativity ( gr ) , has been put in check , since that the observations of galactic velocities in galaxy clusters , the rotational curve of spiral galaxies and the recent discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite via observations of supernovae type ia in 1998 only can be explained correctly with addition of new ingredients in the nature : the so - called dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) .",
    "the dm is a kind of matter that does not interact electromagnetically with other particles of the standard model @xcite .",
    "actually , the dm also has a fundamental role in evolution of cosmic structures in gr context .",
    "the de is an alternative to explain the accelerated evolution of the universe @xcite , once that the cosmological constant ( cc ) , which appears naturally in gr , is plagued with several conceptual problems in which concerns its nature and origin @xcite . in this way , several models of gravity have been appeared in literature in order to give alternatives to gr . among such alternative models , massive gravity theories @xcite , modified newtonian dynamic ( mond ) @xcite , @xmath1 and @xmath2 theories @xcite , brane world models @xcite among others ,",
    "have been proposed recently in order to accommodate the observations . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also important to have mechanisms to test whether these theories actually satisfy various observational constraints .",
    "recently , a wide class of theories of gravity that explicitly breaks the einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) have been considered in the literature and a powerful mechanism to test its signatures in observable constants of nature has been developed by a. hees et al .",
    "they consider models which implements the break of the equivalence principle by introducing an additional term into the action , coupling the usual matter fields @xmath3 to a new scalar field @xmath4 , which is motivated by scalar - tensor theories of gravity , for instance .",
    "the explicit form of the couplings studied by @xcite are of the type @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the lagrangians for different matter fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 represents a non - minimal couplings between @xmath4 and @xmath7 . when @xmath9 we recover the standard gr .",
    "several alternative models can be described by such a kind of coupling .",
    "we can cite string dilaton theories @xcite at low energies , theories with additional compactified dimensions as kaluza - klein @xcite , models involving axions @xcite , cosmologies that consider a varying fine structure constant @xcite , chameleon - field models @xcite or @xmath1 extended gravity theories @xcite .",
    "the most direct consequence of a interaction of the type ( [ action ] ) concerns its relation to the fine structure constant @xmath10 of the quantum electrodynamics .",
    "it is related to the scalar field @xmath4 by @xmath11 , such that a time dependence of @xmath4 will leads to a time variation of the fine structure constant @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "actually , all the electromagnetic sector of the theory also is affected , which implies in a non - conservation of the photon number along geodesics , leading to a modification to the expression of the luminosity distance , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the redshift , which is the basis for various cosmological estimates and also the violation of the so - called cosmic distance - duality relation ( cddr ) , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the angular diameter distance @xcite .",
    "moreover , also due to the non - conservation of the photon number , it is expected a variation of the evolution of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , affecting its temperature distribution . finally , as a consequence of the cmb distribution",
    ", we also expect a cmb spectral distortion , which can be parametrized by a non - null chemical potential . in @xcite",
    "the authors showed that all these effects are closely related to the time evolution of @xmath16 . by using gaussian processes",
    ", they also considered @xmath17 measurements of galaxy clusters obtained via their sunyaev - zeldovich + x - ray observations ( sze / x - ray technique ) , @xmath12 of type ia supernovae , cmb temperature and absorbers to impose limits on @xmath18 .",
    "although the results were not so restrictive , no inconsistency with the standard results was detected .",
    "however , in ref.@xcite it was showed that the sze / x - ray technique depends strongly on the cddr validity as well as on the @xmath10 .",
    "these dependencies were used property in ref.@xcite to search signatures of the equivalence principle breaking .",
    "these authors considered the results from ref.@xcite jointly with galaxy clusters and sne ia observations and showed that if the cddr is not valid , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the sze / x - ray technique does not give the true angular diameter distance of galaxy clusters but @xmath21 .",
    "again , no inconsistency with the standard results was detected by considering two parametrization to @xmath22 , such as @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the more restrictive value to @xmath25 was @xmath26 at 1@xmath27 c.l ..    in this paper we search for signatures of the class of modified gravity theories discussed by ref.@xcite by testing jointly the cddr and the evolution law of cmb temperature .",
    "we consider angular diameter distance samples from galaxy clusters obtained via the sze / x - ray technique , luminosity distances from sne ia and @xmath0 measurements .",
    "moreover , four parametrizations for @xmath22 are used .",
    "the error bars from our jointly analyses are at least @xmath28 smaller than those in ref.@xcite .",
    "our results showed no significant deviation from the standard framework ( @xmath29 ) regardless the @xmath22 function and galaxy cluster sample used .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section ii we briefly revise the theory proposed by ref.@xcite . in section",
    "iii we present our method and the samples used in analyses .",
    "the section iv we show the analyses and results and finally , in the section v are the main conclusions of this work .",
    "as mentioned before , a. hees et al .",
    "@xcite developed a powerful apparatus to test signatures of models characterized by an interaction term into the action of the form ( [ action ] ) in observable constants of nature .",
    "such kind of models implements the break of eep .",
    "we cite here briefly three consequences , namely the temporal variation of the fine structure constant , modification of the cddr and variations and distortions on cmb temperature .",
    "having @xmath11 @xcite , the time variation of the fine structure constant @xmath10 is associated to time variation of the coupling of the electromagnetic lagrangian @xmath30 by @xmath31 where the dot corresponds to the temporal derivative and the prime to the derivative with respect to the scalar field @xmath4 .",
    "writing in terms of the redshift @xmath13 , @xmath32 where the subscript @xmath33 stands for the present epoch @xmath34 , we can define the parameter @xmath35[etaz ] which can be directly interpreted as a constraint on the cosmological evolution of the scalar field @xmath36 .",
    "the expression of the luminosity distance @xmath37 is also modified with respect to the general relativity one @xcite , given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the speed of the light and @xmath40 is the hubble parameter . on the other hand ,",
    "the angular diameter distance @xmath15 is a purely geometric property that is the same as in general relativity and it is given by @xcite @xmath41 by comparing with ( [ dl ] ) we obtain @xmath42 which shows that the cddr can also be related to @xmath22 .",
    "the equations that governs the evolution of the temperature of the cmb are based on the kinetic theory ( see it in @xcite and @xcite ) , which satisfy the boltzmann equations of statistical mechanics .",
    "however , a non - conservation of the photon number due to a coupling of the form ( [ action ] ) may also alter the evolution of the cmb radiation .",
    "there is also a connection between violations of the temperature - redshift relation and variations of the fine structure constant .",
    "furthermore , the coupling ( [ action ] ) also implies that the cmb radiation does not obey the adiabaticity condition @xcite , whose distortion of the cmb spectrum can be parametrized by a chemical potential @xmath43 .",
    "the relations for the cmb temperature evolution and the chemical potential as a function of @xmath22 are @xcite @xmath44 , \\label{t}\\ ] ] @xmath45 which are related each other .",
    "it is useful to express the experimental constraints on the evolution of the temperature as a function of the parameter @xmath46 , denoted by @xmath47 a. hees et al . @xcite",
    "have shown that the four cosmological observables , ( [ alpha ] ) , ( [ dlda ] ) , ( [ t ] ) and ( [ mu ] ) are directly related to the evolution of the function @xmath48 by @xmath49         as it is well - known , there are astronomical methods based on the analysis of high - redshift quasar absorption systems to test the @xmath50 value .",
    "the many - multiplet method , which compares the characteristics of different transitions in the same absorption cloud , is the most successful method employed so far to measure possible variations of @xmath10 .",
    "however , very recently , constraints on the variations of the fine structure constant @xmath10 have been derived directly from cosmological observations such as the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) and x - ray emission in galaxy cluster .",
    "for example , ref.@xcite proposed a new method using the integrated comptonization parameter @xmath51 and its x - ray counterpart @xmath52 , and the ratio of these two parameters depends on the fine structure constant as @xmath53 .",
    "recently , holanda et al .",
    "@xcite showed that measurements of the gas mass fraction can also be used to probe a possible time evolution of the fine structure constant .",
    "for that purpose , they have showed that observations of the gas mass fraction via x - ray surface brightness and the sze for the same galaxy cluster are related by @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "taking into account a direct relation between variation of @xmath10 and the cddr , eq .",
    "( [ dlda ] ) , and particularizing the analysis by considering a class of dilaton runaway models in which @xmath56 , it was found @xmath57 at @xmath58 c.l . , consistent with no variation of @xmath10 .",
    "more recently , a deeper analysis from ref.@xcite of the sze / x - ray technique showed that measurements of @xmath59 of galaxy clusters by using this technique also depends on the fine structure constant .",
    "they have showed that if @xmath60 , current sze and x - ray observations do not provide the real angular diameter distance but instead @xmath61 in order to perform their analysis , they have transformed 25 measurements of @xmath37 from current sne ia observations into @xmath59 , taking into account the direct relation , shown by hees et al .",
    "@xcite , between a variation of @xmath10 and the cddr .",
    "when combined with 25 measurements of @xmath62 from galaxy clusters in the range of redshift @xmath63 , these data sets impose cosmological limits on @xmath36 for a class of dilaton runaway models .",
    "so , they have found @xmath64 , which is also consistent with no variation of @xmath10 . on the other hand , in ref.@xcite",
    "it has been used the eq .",
    "( [ eqnew ] ) and the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath65 to impose tighter limits on deviation from cddr than previous works . by using @xmath23 and @xmath24 ,",
    "the most restrictive value to @xmath25 is @xmath26 at 1@xmath27 c.l ..",
    "in the present paper we test the same class of modified gravity theories presented in ref.@xcite following the ref.@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we use different galaxy cluster sample , sne ia and we also include measurements of cmb temperature in order to put tighter constraints from the analyses . in other words , we search for deviations from cddr validity by using the relations presented in the previous section ( see eq.[rel ] ) .",
    "the samples used here are :    * we consider 29 well - described galaxy clusters by a spherical non - isothermal double @xmath46 model from a original sample of 38 from ref.@xcite , see fig.(1a ) .",
    "this model take into account a possible presence of cooling flow in galaxy cluster cores .",
    "we cut - off the galaxy clusters that presented questionable reduced @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) when described by the hydrostatic equilibrium model .",
    "it is important to stress that the frequency used to obtain the sze signal in galaxy clusters sample considered was 30 ghz , in this band the effect on the sze from a variation of @xmath68 is completely negligible .",
    "the best frequency is 150 ghz for negative signals and around 260 ghz for positive signals .",
    "therefore , we do not consider a modified cmb temperature evolution law in the galaxy cluster data . *",
    "the full sne ia sample is formed by 580 sne ia data compiled in ref.@xcite , the so - called union2.1 compilation , see fig.(1a ) . in order to perform our test",
    "we need sne ia and galaxy clusters in the identical redshifts . in this way , we consider the 29 angular diameter distance of galaxy clusters from the sample of @xcite and , for each i - galaxy cluster , we obtain one distance modulus , @xmath69 , and its error , @xmath70 , from all i - sne ia with @xmath71 .",
    "naturally , this criterion allows us to have some sne ia for each galaxy cluster and so we can perform a weighted average with them in order to minimize the scatter observed on the hubble diagram .",
    "then , we calculate the following weighted average @xcite from sne ia data : @xmath72 * the @xmath0 sample is composed by 38 points , see fig.(1b ) .",
    "the data in low redshift are from sze observations @xcite and from observations of spectral lines we have the data at high redshift @xcite . in total , this represents 38 observations of the cmb temperature at redshift between 0 and 3 .",
    "we also use the estimation of the current cmb temperature @xmath73 k @xcite from the cmb spectrum as estimated from the cobe collaboration ( see fig.(1b ) ) .",
    "as already discussed in @xcite , for the class of theories discussed by hees et al . , the sze + x - ray measurements of galaxy clusters do not give the true add , but @xmath74 ( where was used @xmath75 in eq.([eqnew ] ) .",
    "moreover , as argued in @xcite , if one wants to test the cddr by using @xmath76 and galaxy clusters via sze / x - ray technique , the add @xmath17 must be replaced by @xmath77 ( @xmath78 in their case , since variations of @xmath10 were not considered ) . in this way",
    ", we have access to @xmath79 by using the equation above , we define the distance modulus of a galaxy cluster data as @xmath80 + 25.\\ ] ] we evaluate our statistical analysis by defining the likelihood distribution function , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 } ^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}_{t_i , obs } } , \\label{chi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath83 and @xmath84 given by eq.(8 ) .",
    "the sources of statistical uncertainty in the error bars of @xmath85(z ) are : sze point sources @xmath86% , x - ray background @xmath87% , galactic n@xmath88 @xmath89 , @xmath86% kinetic sz and for cmb anisotropy @xmath90 .",
    "we have added in quadrature the following systematic errors : sz calibration @xmath86% , x - ray flux calibration @xmath91% , radio halos @xmath92% , and x - ray temperature calibration @xmath93% . following @xcite we added a 0.15 systematic error to sne ia data .    in order to explore the dependence of our results with @xmath22 function , we consider 4 parametrizations , namely :    * p1 : @xmath23 * p2 : @xmath94 * p3 : @xmath95 * p4 : @xmath96    where @xmath25 and @xmath97 are the parameters to be constrained .",
    "the limits @xmath98 corresponds to the standard gr results .",
    "our results are plotted in figs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) for each parametrization and samples described in sec.iii .",
    "note that in each case the solid ( blue ) and dashed ( red ) lines correspond to analyses by using separately cmb temperature and galaxy clusters + sne ia data in eq.(17 ) , respectively .",
    "the dashed area are the results from the joint analysis , i.e. , the complete eq.(17 ) with cmb temperature + galaxy clusters + sne ia . in table",
    "i we put our 1@xmath27 results from the joint analyses for each parametrization and several @xmath25 values present in literature , obtained by using add from galaxy clusters + sne ia that did not take into account the effect of a possible @xmath10 variation on the sze / x - ray technique .",
    "notoriously our results present tighter limits on @xmath25 value than previous analyses .",
    "we also present the results obtained by using the galaxy clusters sample from ref.@xcite , where the x - ray surface brightness was described by a elliptical isothermal @xmath46-model in order to compare results . in this case , the galaxy clusters are distributed over the redshift interval @xmath99 .",
    "it is very important to consider another assumptions on the galaxy clusters morphology since the add depends on the hypotheses considered .",
    "as one may see , our results are in full agreement each other regardless the galaxy clusters sample and @xmath22 function used .",
    "moreover , no indication of deviations from standard results is obtained .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in ref.@xcite it was developed a powerful mechanism to test signatures of a wide class of theories of gravity that explicitly breaks the einstein equivalence principle .",
    "briefly , they introduced an additional term into the action ( see eq.(1 ) ) coupling the usual matter fields to a scalar additional field , which is motivated by scalar - tensor theories of gravity , for instance .",
    "actually , all the electromagnetic sector of the theory is affected , leading to deviations of the cddr validity , @xmath100 , variations of fundamental constants , @xmath50 ( where @xmath10 is the fine structure constant ) , and of the evolution law of the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "the distortions of the standard results are related by eq.(11 ) .    in this paper , we have used add of galaxy clusters obtained via their sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) + x - ray surface brightness observations , luminosity distances of sne ia and cmbr temperature to search signatures of the class of theories considered . by properly considering these deviations in the data , mainly on the sze / x - ray technique which depends explicitly on the @xmath65 and @xmath10 , we put constraints on four parametrization of @xmath22 via a jointly analysis of data ( see last two lines of table i ) .",
    "we have obtained tighter constraints on possible deviations from gr than previous works , and all case were found to be in full agreement with standard gr framework , @xmath101 .",
    "however , the results presented here do not rule out the models under question with high confidence level yet .",
    "when larger samples with smaller statistical and systematic uncertainties of x - ray and sze observations as well as @xmath0 measurements and sne ia become available , the method proposed here will be able to search deviations from the standard framework with more accuracy .",
