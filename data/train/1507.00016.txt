    "in the current picture of star formation , giant molecular clouds ( gmc ) are highly inefficient factories , in which only a small fraction of the available gas is converted into stars . moreover , star forming regions in gmc complexes are highly heterogeneous .",
    "there is a considerable diversity among the stellar aggregations they produce .",
    "differences are evident even at the level of their basic properties , e.g. sizes , numbers and density structures .",
    "aggregations of young stars in molecular clouds are classified as embedded star clusters .",
    "these clusters are born as bound systems of gas and stars .",
    "once gas is removed , embedded clusters may or may not stay bound .",
    "they either survive ( e.g. open clusters ) , or dissolve to become part of the field population . for a majority of clusters in the galaxy ,",
    "the latter is the common outcome .",
    "however , recent discussions consider that cluster morphology is more heterogeneous @xcite .",
    "numerical studies suggest that small groups of stars may be abundant @xcite and they may either merge to form clusters or disrupt rapidly into the field . according to studies like that of @xcite , star clusters may assemble from sub - clusters that merge into larger entities after the gas from which they formed is both disrupted by stellar feedback and torn apart by tidal shocks from the surrounding cloud ( the so called  cruel cradle \" effect ) .    unfortunately , the dynamical picture of cluster evolution provided by numerical studies is difficult to directly compare with observations . on one hand ,",
    "the initial conditions of cluster formation , a key requirement for realistic simulations , are still under debate . on the other hand , young cluster evolution from observations ,",
    "would require of additional information on the kinematics of stars ( e.g. radial velocities ) , and spectroscopic age estimations of individual sources to infer the progression of formation .",
    "such studies are only beginning to arise from surveys like apogee ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and are limited to nearby ( @xmath0 kpc ) regions .",
    "meanwhile , it is possible to partially reconstruct the history of star formation in a region from photometric information , which can provide evolutive classification and the spatial distribution of young sources , and from molecular gas emission maps , which can provide gas distribution and kinematics .",
    "surveys of gmcs show that embedded star clusters are rarely ( if ever ) born in isolation . most embedded clusters form as part of  families \" related to a particular complex , defining together a history of star formation from various levels of interaction . for instance , massive stars of one cluster may have influence on the efficiency of star formation of a neighboring cluster in the same cloud . considering all this , it should be clear that star formation is highly dynamic ; the embedded populations we observe are snapshots of a rather convoluted process of evolution and interaction , that changes significantly along the star forming history of a complex .        in order to investigate the progression of cluster formation under the influence of the local environment",
    ", we considered w3 , a prominent cluster forming region in the  heart and soul \" molecular complex .",
    "w3 is considered a clear example of sequential formation , where cluster formation was induced by the expansion of the giant hii region w4 @xcite .",
    "one of our goals is to trace the formation of distinct embedded clusters in this region and to attempt to reconstruct the star forming history of the cloud .",
    "the w3 complex is located at a distance of 2.04@xmath10.107 kpc , o masers in w3(oh ) by @xcite ] and has hosted at least three major episodes of recent cluster formation . according to spectroscopic studies , ic 1795 formed first , about 3 - 5 myr @xcite ago , followed by the w3  main \" cluster located to its west edge , and the w3(oh ) cluster group to the east , both with ages of 2 - 3 myr @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that ic 1795 triggered the other two episodes in a hierarchical progression @xcite .",
    "the chandra study by @xcite suggested that the clusters in w3 extend widely and are highly structured , with sources located at relatively large distances from the dynamical centers , including a relatively isolated o star that might have escaped from the main cluster .",
    "in two recent studies , @xcite made use of mid - infrared photometry and far - ir emission mapping from the spitzer and herschel space observatories , that comprise the entire w3 region .",
    "they were able to catalog hundreds of young stellar sources ( ysos ) across the complex and determine their spatial distribution .",
    "they compiled important evidence that projected distances among ysos are consistent with cluster forming clump scales , favoring the cluster forming mode .",
    "they also concluded that small aggregations and distributed populations , account for a significant fraction of the recent stellar production in the region .",
    "they suggest relative large age spreads from central to external regions in w3 and proposed a ",
    "convergent constructive feedback \" scenario , where the gas flows from massive star formation clumps and collects into new dense regions , favoring a progression of formation and the age spread .    in this study",
    "we emphasize the relative importance of different young stellar groupings in and around ic 1795 , w3-main and w3(oh ) , augmenting the level of detail achieved in previous studies .",
    "we present a new set of deep , high resolution near - ir photometry that we combine with other available datasets , allowing us to increase the number of young star candidates in the complex .",
    "we use a k - band luminosity function analysis to investigate the presence of an age spread , and to help reconstruct the history of star formation in the cloud .",
    "finally , we investigate gas kinematics near the clusters , providing additional information on the gas - star interaction during the early evolution of the complex .",
    "we obtained near - infrared images of four fields in w3 , covering a large area ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) .",
    "images were obtained with the omega 2000 camera at the 3.5 m telescope in the calar alto observatory of the centro astronmico hispano alemn ( caha ) in almera , spain .",
    "omega 2000 provides a @xmath4 field of view ( fov ) .",
    "observations were made in @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( 1.1 , 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath8 m , respectively ) .",
    "a list of all fields observed is listed table [ tab : obs ] , which gives the field identification , the center of field positions , observation date , filter , seeing ( estimated from sigma - clipped average full width half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the stars in each field ) , and the peak values for the brightness distribution , which is a good estimate of the sensitivity limits achieved .",
    "the brightness distribution peaks are in all cases at or above @xmath9 mag , @xmath10 mag and @xmath11 mag .",
    "the omega 2000 images were reduced with modified versions of the flamingos near - infrared reduction and photometry / astrometry pipelines , which are built in the standard ` iraf ` command language environment .",
    "one pipeline ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) processes all raw frames by subtracting darks and dividing by flat fields , improving signal to noise ratios by means of a two pass sky subtraction method , and combining reduced frames with an optimized centroid offset calculation .",
    "we used dark frames and dome flats obtained within 48 hours of each observation .",
    "the final combined product images were then analyzed with a second pipeline , ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which identifies all possible sources from a given field using the ` sextractor ` algorithm @xcite .",
    "we improved the ` sextractor ` detection efficiency in the near - ir images by using a gaussian convolution filter and maximum deblending ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the pipeline then performs ` daophot ` psf photometry @xcite , calibrates observed magnitudes to a zero point and finds accurate astrometric solutions .",

    "the near - ir images at w3(oh ) are particularly interesting because they reveal , with unprecedented detail , several small , embedded stellar groups that lie in a small  chain \" structure north and east of the w3(oh ) cluster ( these groups have been previously identified ; e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : w3oh ] we show a close - up image of this region , where we now combine h and k images with the spitzer irac 3.6 @xmath8 m image to enhance illuminated nebulosity features and highlight the most reddened sources .",
    "we have labeled the w3(oh ) cluster with the letter ` a ' .",
    "the two other most conspicuous groups in the chain , both associated with b - type stars @xcite have been labeled with letters ` b ' and ` c ' .",
    "the former group is not as prominent as an over - density but as it can be seen in the mosaic , it is associated with thick nebulosity , so it is possibly more deeply embedded .",
    "there is one more bright source sitting at the center of a cavity in between groups b and c , which we suspect could be an additional sub - group .",
    "the omega 2000 photometry was calibrated relative to the two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , using catalogs retrieved from the all sky release point source databases .",
    "final photometry catalogs were prepared with aid of ` topcat - stil ` @xcite .",
    "we combined individual photometry catalogs from each frame and filter and merged catalogs from all four fields into a master photometry list . in the overlapping areas , we selected the duplicates with the smaller total photometric error across the three bands in either field . finally , we added 2mass entries to replace failed measurements from saturated sources .",
    "our final near - ir catalog contains a total of 72168 sources .",
    "we performed a new reduction and photometric extraction of the w3 mosaics from project 1 - 127 available in the spitzer heritage archive .",
    "mosaics were constructed by processing both the short and long exposure ( 0.4 and 10.4 sec ) basic calibrated sets ( bcd ) from irac ( all four bands ) and the bcd set from mips ( 24 @xmath8 m only ) observations using the mopex package .",
    "we used the irac short exposure datasets to improve extraction of sources down the centers of w3-main and w3(oh ) regions , which present large areas of saturation ( increasing with wavelength ) due to bright nebulosities in the long exposure sets .",
    "however , even at the short exposure images , the bright nebulosity made it very difficult to obtain uniform quality from aperture photometry in the irac images , so we performed psf photometry with ` daophot ` on detection lists obtained with ` sextractor ` . in this case , we improved the detection efficiency by using a ",
    "mexican hat \" convolution filter and reduced deblending ( see * ? ? ? * ) ( compare to the near - ir , in section [ s : observations : ss : nir : sss : reduction ] , above ) .",
    "then , our pipeline selects a group of moderately bright and relatively isolated sources in order to make a psf model for each ` daophot ` run . in all cases we were able to fit the psf model to a large majority of the detected sources .",
    "final source detection lists were slightly cleaned with the aid of ` photvis ` @xcite to remove spurious detections .",
    "the resultant photometry lists showed a net reduction of up to 12% in the photometric scatter to the aperture photometry obtained with the apex software .",
    "for the mips 24 @xmath8 m mosaic we used the apex aperture photometry pipeline , which was good enough for non - saturated regions of the field . in heavily saturated regions ,",
    "particularly near the centers of w3-main and w3(oh ) , missing pixels impeded the ability to make good measurements , and we could not improve these measurements with psf photometry .",

    "the agreement between both glimpse and @xcite is excellent and zero point corrections were not required .",
    "the final photometry catalogs from the irac and mips 24 @xmath8 m mosaics were then combined into a mid - ir catalog with 37267 sources , which we later merged with the near - ir catalog from our caha dataset to form a master source catalog .      in this study",

    "then , using the chandra csc catalogs we identified class iii sources as x - ray sources with infrared counterparts and no excess associated to circumstellar material . finally , we identified additional class i and class ii sources as x - ray csc sources with infrared excess , by applying criteria that combine near - infrared and irac colors ( see appendix of   * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "our list contains a significantly larger number of yso candidates compared to the list of @xcite .",
    "we suspect that the differences are mostly due to the addition of x - ray and near - infrared criteria which increased the number of candidates in each class .",

    "in contrast , for the @xmath7 band , the distribution for class iii sources drops at about 15.0 mag , while the distributions for class i and class ii sources drop near 18.0 mag .",
    "these histograms show that , due to the high and non - uniform extinction , the brightness distributions for young sources are likely incomplete above the sensitivity limits . however , our near - ir observations are deep enough to detect young sources across the entire region . for this reason ,",

    "the yso sources appear to be very well constrained to the three well known areas of the complex ( namely ic 1795 , w3-main and w3(oh ) ) .",
    "class i sources are mostly confined to the areas of high extinction : following the prescription of @xcite , we found that over 80 percent of the class i sources are located in high extinction regions ( @xmath20 mag ) , and the surface density of class i sources is linearly correlated with @xmath21 within @xmath22 mag .",
    "this is in very good agreement with other cluster forming regions like orion a @xcite and the rosette molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "class ii sources clearly permeate the entire complex , while class iii sources appear to have a slightly more centrally condensed distribution in the ic 1795 region but are also present in the western edge of w3-main and surrounding the areas of low extinction to the east of w3(oh ) .",
    "two aspects are important to notice .",
    "first , cluster regions are not separated clearly in the layout of the complex , which suggest at least some partial overlap along the line of sight perpendicular to the field .",
    "second , the spatial distribution of young sources suggest that clusters are not single , centrally condensed systems . instead , they appear to have sub - structure .    in the following we a )",
    "make a consistent separation of the individual cluster populations and b ) provide evidence of the presence of sub - structure in the cluster population by using a surface density analysis .",
    "we make the following two definitions :    1 .",
    "we define a _ principal cluster _ as a surface density structure that can be associated to a single gaussian peak with a fwhm of at least 1.0 pc ( see @xmath23[s : analysis : ss : ysodist : sss : gmm ] , below ) .",
    "we define a _ sub - structure _ as a significant surface density peak , smaller than a principal cluster .",
    "we identified as significant , all those peaks with a surface density above 1.0 stars per sq .",
    "arcmin ( see @xmath23[s : analysis : ss : ysodist : sss : gather ] , below ) .",
    "in order to delimit individual clusters , we employed a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) analysis via the ` mclust ` package on the ` r ` code @xcite .",
    "the package provides a model - based clustering analysis of any population , based on covariance parametrization and an expectation - minimization ( em ) algorithm .",
    "it can also divide a population in an optimized number of clusters by means of the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) .",
    "the bic is the value of the maximized log - likelihood with a penalty on the number of model parameters , and allows comparison of models with different parameter sets as well as solutions with different numbers of clusters .    .",
    "[ fig : gmm],width=595 ]    we chose the class ii sample as it is the most complete and it is distributed more or less uniformly across the complex .",
    "ra , dec positions were fed into the code as a sample of bivariate observations .",
    "we chose to use circular gaussians to minimize the number of parameters required for the estimation .",
    "given the complicated layout of the clusters in w3 , we opted to run the gmm analysis including noise modeling and rejection of outliers .",
    "for our dataset , a model of five clusters provided the best fit for the sample .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : gmm ] .",
    "while this finite mixture model shows less detail than for instance the nearest neighbor analysis , we see that it succeeds at identifying the three well known clusters in the region ( w3-main , w3(oh ) , ic 1795 ) .",
    "it also adds two more principal clusters , one coinciding with ngc 896 , the compact hii region located at the western edge of the complex , and one more located at the eastern edge .",
    "we labelled this group ic 1795-n . in table",
    "[ tab : principal_clusters ] we list the result of the gmm analysis , with the centers and radii of the five principal clusters identified ( columns 1 to 4 ) .",
    "we emphasize that the purpose of this exercise is to define the principal clusters as consistent samples to study the history of star formation in the complex .",
    "the gmm analysis provides such consistent identification , which may differ with respect to other identification methods ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "estimating the surface density of young stellar sources is often done by applying a variant of the nearest neighbor method ( formalized for star cluster detection by   * ? ? ?",
    "this method has been applied successfully in different studies ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , two very important issues regarding this method must be pointed out .",
    "first , when calculating distances to the @xmath24th neighbor in a distribution of points on a plane , there is a minimum value @xmath25 to avoid biasing the detection toward small structures formed purely by chance in a 2-dimensional distribution of points .",
    "second , when mapping the surface density defined by such distances , the choice of an optimal smoothing kernel that would not dilute genuine substructures neither generate spurious ones , is not straightforward .",
    "these two issues were taken into consideration by @xcite , who developed two nearest neighbor mapping methods , _ gather _ and _ scatter _ , both optimized to correctly detect small groups ( in our case , possible cluster substructures ) in source position maps .",
    "the _ gather _ algorithm is more adequate for determining hierarchical structure , while the _ scatter _ method is more adequate for defining the size of the smallest group in a distribution of points on a map .",
    "the _ gather _ algorithm was better suited for the task of detecting and separating sub - structures .",
    "we applied _ gather _ to the distribution of all class ii yso candidates in the w3 region , which is the most complete of our samples .",
    "densities were calculated with a square kernel of 36@xmath26 over a nyquist sampled ra - dec grid . in figure",
    "[ fig : gather ] we show the resultant map , in the form of surface density contours overlaid on an infrared emission image that combines data from the spitzer mips 24@xmath8 m , 70@xmath8 m from herschel pacs and 250 @xmath8 m from herschel spire .",
    "if we compare the density map to the spatial distribution of sources in figure [ fig : ysopos ] we see how _ gather _ highlights the three main regions ( ic 1795 , w3-main and w3(oh ) ) as the principal clusters , but also shows a number of peaks that clearly define significant sub - structure in the spatial distribution of young sources .",
    "the positions and equivalent sizes of sub - structure peaks in the _ gather _ map are listed in table [ tab : substructures ] .",
    "some of the sub - structure peaks in the map coincide in position with one or several class i sources .",
    "those peaks are likely related to the most recent episodes of formation in the complex . notice how none of the peaks near the center , corresponding to ic 1795 , are associated with class i sources , possibly indicating an absence of current formation .",
    "we also show the positions of o and b type stars listed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",

    "we found that the whole complex has @xmath34 which suggests star formation was ubiquitous throughout the complex @xmath35 2 - 3 myr ago .",
    "we can also trace the most recent star formation by using the @xmath30 ratio ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ratiomaps ] , right ) . regions with significant @xmath30 are expected to have been actively forming stars within the last myr .",
    "we found that the regions of high @xmath30 appear to form an oblong ring around ic 1795 .",
    "this mirrors the distribution of class i/0 sources which also appear to surround ic 1795 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gather ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the high @xmath29 in ic 1795 suggests that stars were forming there up to 1 myr ago .",
    "therefore the absence of class i/0 sources in ic 1795 suggests that star formation was recently and possibly abruptly terminated in that region .",
    "it is important to notice that values for the @xmath29 ratio in the map can be high ( typically larger than 5 ) , particularly because the class iii sources are more spatially scattered .",
    "however , the @xmath29 is not the same as the circumstellar disk fraction in the cluster , because we are only measuring against weak disk sources and not the whole population ( see also section [ s : analysis : ss : klf ] , below ) .",
    "+      we obtained the k band luminosity function ( klf ) for each of the five principal clusters identified with our gmm analysis using the following procedure :    each cluster sample is composed by all k - band sources detected within a  3-sigma \" radius defined as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is defined from the gmm analysis as the half - width at half - maximum of the best fit 2-d gaussian .",

    "we estimated the fraction of sources with circumstellar disks within @xmath38 , for each principal cluster , as the total number of class i plus class ii sources in the extinction limited sample , down to a de - reddened brightness @xmath6=13.5 mag .",

    "was estimated from a nearby control field with minimum extinction , observed in the same conditions and to the same depth as the cloud fields ( see appendix [ app : obs ] ) .",
    "we made a k - band histogram from the control field catalog and scaled it to the same area of the cluster sample .",
    "then we subtracted the foreground contribution from the control field klf , and applied artificial reddening to the remaining distribution down to the same level as the cloud sample .",
    "artificial reddening is applied by constructing a normalized @xmath21 extinction distribution from the background stars in each cluster region using the nicer algorithm , and used it as a frequency distribution to convolve the control field k - band histogram , producing a final control field k band brightness distribution .",
    "the nicer algorithm provides estimates of extinction with average errors @xmath410.1 mag below @xmath3930 mag .",
    "these errors are way below the size of the k - band brightness bins used to construct the klf .",
    "the final klf of the cluster sample is obtained by subtracting the final @xmath21-convolved ( reddened ) control field distribution from the one constructed from the k - band limited sample .",
    "the advantages of using a k - band limited sample to construct the klf are : a ) that all samples are cut at common maximum extinction ; b ) that the contribution of background extra - galactic sources is reduced to a minimum ; c ) that patchy extinction is less prone to bias the brightness distribution , specially at the most embedded regions e.g .",
    "centers of w3-main and w3(oh ) .",

    "just over 3 myr ago , the process of cluster formation continued with ic 1795 and the first episode in w3-main and w3(oh ) , while clumps corresponding to the present w3(oh ) cluster group would be collapsing .",
    "about 2 - 3 myr ago , gas dispersal could have started in ic 1795 , ic 1795-n , ngc 896 and the eastern edge of w3(oh ) .",
    "the most recent episodes in w3-main and w3(oh ) would have started . by then",
    ", gas would be dispersed away from the center of the complex and start concentrating at the w3(oh ) and w3-main regions .",
    "this would resemble the current layout of the complex , with most of the remnant molecular gas being at w3(oh ) and w3-main . in this scenario ,",
    "cluster formation progressed first from north and south towards the center of the complex and then from the center towards east and west.it is important to notice that this scenario is based on our estimates of the mean ages of the clusters , but could only be supported by a better constrain of the age spreads of the clusters .",
    "one important point to discuss here is whether or not induced formation plays a dominant role on the formation of clusters in the w3 complex , as suggested by previous studies .",
    "for instance , @xcite support the picture in which ic 1795 triggered the formation of w3 main and w3(oh ) episodes .",
    "the study by @xcite suggest that triggering processes were important in the formation of the clusters flanking ic 1795 , but also that triggering processes work at local ( sub - parsec ) scales , with high mass stars acting to confine and compress material , enhancing the efficiency for the formation of new high mass stars by making convergent flows .",
    "this , in turn , would help to the progression of formation from the outer toward in the inner regions of the complex .",
    "the study by @xcite , pointed to significant gradient of ages between the central ob sources of the cluster and a widely distributed population of pms stars .",
    "what does our study tell about the global star forming history of the complex ?",
    "on one hand , if gas removal in the central cluster ic 1795 contributed to collect gas in a shell like structure , it may have enhanced the efficiency of formation in w3-main and w3(oh ) .",
    "this would be in agreement with the flow convergence scenario discussed by @xcite . according to that picture , ic 1795",
    "could have been the major source of induction for star formation in the molecular shell .",
    "our klf model analysis indicates large age spreads across the complex , with a progression that lead to cluster formation across the entire complex in a period of about 3 million years .",
    "this is in good agreement with our analysis of the yso class surface density ratio across the complex . in that case",
    ", the progression is possibly related to primordial density structure of the cloud .",
    "this is in agreement with the scenario proposed for other complexes like the rosette molecular cloud @xcite , where it has been shown that progression of cluster formation could rather follow the density structure of the cloud than a process of induction in a sequence from the older to the younger episodes .",
    "our yso surface density analysis provides evidence of sub - structure in the principal cluster populations .",
    "small aggregations of stars around the main cluster events ( very evident in w3(oh ) , and groups like r102 and r103 ) , revealed as significant peaks in the surface density of ysos , in many cases coincident with the locations of class 0/i candidates .",
    "this is suggestive of a complex scenario , in which stellar collections of different sizes may form with small age differences by the compression of gas in various locations within large clumps .",
    "strong evidence of sub - clustering in w3-main was also provided by the very deep near - ir klf by @xcite : they pointed out that an age gradient was evident from edge to center in w3-main , judging from a higher fraction of circumstellar disks near the center .",
    "the large number of disk bearing sources in ic 1795 could be indicative of a similar process , where cluster formation occurs in sub - structures .",
    "if these sub - structures do not form simultaneously , they certainly may lead to a large age spread , as observed .",
    "the projected separations between surface density peaks in the ` gather ` map range is 1.4@xmath10.4 pc .",
    "these separations are comparable to the estimated radii of the principal clusters identified with our gmm model .",
    "this scale is shorter than the jeans length ( 2.0 pc ) for a mean density of @xmath65 and @xmath66 k , typical of the diffuse gas traced by @xmath14co and may be tracing the primordial fragmentation of the cloud .",
    "one possibility is that density peaks in the ` gather ` map are sub - clusters that eventually merge into larger groups , but that will depend on the dynamical stability of the aggregations and the gravitational potential of the corresponding principal cluster .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite suggest , that clusters are initially highly structured , but rapidly evolve by merging into large entities . on the other hand , small groups of stars",
    "may disperse rapidly or even remain stable depending crucially on the number of members and the star forming efficiency @xcite .",
    "it is also expected that most small , embedded aggregations end up being disrupted early , as proposed by the  infant mortality \" and  cruel cradle \" models .",
    "the formation of small groups that disperse rapidly and merge into a larger central structure could provide a simple explanation for the presence of larger age spreads in a lower surface density population in regions like ic 1795-n or ngc 896 , and would be in agreement with age spreads and sub - structure in the younger principal clusters .",
    "the strong outflows in the molecular gas shell at w3-main and w3(oh ) confirm a very rapid removal of gas in the complex .",
    "this removal may occur in a period comparable to the t tauri timescale , as evidenced by class ii source candidates in ic 1795 , where gas is mostly dispersed .",
    "however , it is important to stress that the mass loss rate can not be constant , and will probably decline within a few @xmath67 myr , if it has not already done so .",
    "the estimate we provided , however , may not be far from the average mass loss rate during the main gas dissipation period .",
    "we obtained deep , high resolution ground - based near - ir images of the eastern edge of the w3 region in the perseus arm .",
    "these data were combined with archive imaging data from the spitzer and chandra space telescopes to obtain a new catalog of young sources for the w3 complex .",
    "we used our resultant catalog to :    1 .   identify and classify young ( class i ,",
    "ii , iii ) embedded sources in the region .",
    "2 .   determine the locations and extension of the principal clusters in the complex .",
    "3 .   determine the spatial distribution of young sources across the complex .",
    "this distribution shows significant substructure .",
    "4 .   construct extinction limited samples that allowed us to obtain clean k - band luminosity functions of the principal clusters .",
    "we compared the resultant functions with those from artificial clusters of ages created from pre - main sequence models .",
    "this analysis permitted to estimate mean ages and possible age spreads for the principal clusters of the w3 complex .",
    "we found that ic 1795 , the central cluster of the complex , still has a large fraction of class ii sources , despite not being embedded anymore , like clusters w3-main and w3(oh ) .",
    "the @xmath63 ratio is large across ic 1795 , just as it is in the flanking embedded clusters .",
    "the @xmath15co map shows some receding molecular gas clumps coincident with the center of ic 1795 .",
    "this , along with the absence of class i sources suggest that parental gas was removed quickly from ic 1795 , in a period shorter than the t tauri timescale .",
    "the high mass loss rate estimate at the center of w3-main supports this strongly .",
    "our gaussian mixture model analysis clearly identified the well known clusters ic 1795 , w3-main and w3(oh ) .",
    "in addition , two principal clusters could be identified , one associated with the compact hii region ngc 896 and one more located north of ic 1795 .",
    "we estimated the ages and age spreads of the principal clusters by comparing their k - band luminosity functions with those of artificial young clusters .",
    "the differences between the ages of the clusters are not significantly large .",
    "we also were able to constrain the age spread of the w3 cluster , but we could not constrain well the age spread of the other four clusters , so there might be overlaps in the formation periods of all clusters in the complex .",
    "this , is confirmed by a large number of class ii and class iii sources across the whole complex .",
    "this suggest a progression of cluster formation scenario in which formation proceeded as a result of primordial density structure of the cloud .",
    "using our list of class ii candidates , we constructed a surface density map that shows a significant amount of substructure in the principal clusters of the complex .",
    "the large age spread in the clusters may indicate that formation proceeds in episodes .",
    "if sub - structures observed do not form simultaneously , they certainly may lead to a large age spread , like we observe .",
    "we propose a scenario in which star cluster formation progressed over 4 myr ago from north and south ( clusters ngc 896 and ic 1795-n ) toward ic 1795 . later",
    "( about 2 to 3 myr ago ) , the progression moved from center ( ic 1795 ) towards east and west ( w3(oh ) and w3-main ) .",
    "we also suggest that an undefined region east of w3(oh ) could form groups of stars before the formation of the embedded multiple embedded groups we see today .",
    "the formation of w3(oh ) and w3 main is still in progress at the edge of the giant molecular shell of the complex . using molecular emission maps , we showed that the two main gas clumps associated with these clusters ( which together contain more than 4.5@xmath68 ) show strong velocity gradients and gas outflow activity , spatially coincident with clusters and sub - structures .",
    "this is in good agreement with the convergent flow scenario @xcite that contributes to a large massive star formation efficiency in w3 .",
    "our analysis suggest that both the progression of formation following the primordial structure of the original giant molecular cloud , and the triggered formation caused by the compression and dispersal of gas ( that is , within the cloud ) are both important in w3 .",
    "the w3 complex , presents a rather complicated layout .",
    "the principal clusters overlap partially along the line of sight and they may still interact with each other .",
    "moreover , the clusters present a significant sub - structure .",
    "if the sub - structures are bonafide sub - clusters , they pose an interesting problem for future higher quality data .",
    "particularly , space based mid - infrared imaging with high resolution and deeper photometric limits ( e.g. the james webb space telescope ) will provide more complete samples of the sub - cluster population .",
    "also , spectroscopic data for individual young candidate members , may refine age and age spread estimates .",
