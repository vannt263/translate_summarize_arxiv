    "recently a lot of attention has been focused on the properties of flavoured holographic gauge theories and their potential application to realistic phenomenological models .",
    "one of the main motivations for such studies is the simple geometric description that holographic models provide of non - perturbative phenomena difficult to study via conventional field theoretical methods .    despite the growing spectrum of applications of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite a major limitation",
    "is that realistic field theories do not seem to have simple holographic backgrounds .",
    "this is why it is of particular importance to investigate properties of non - abelian gauge theories exhibiting universal behaviour .",
    "particularly interesting is to analyze the phase structure of strongly coupled yang - mills theories .",
    "an example of such application of the holographic approach is the study of properties of strongly coupled quark - gluon plasmas ( see refs .",

    "the phase transition has been classified as a first order one .",

    "one major aspect of the analysis presented in this paper is the phenomena of mass generation in an external magnetic field .",

    "the effect was shown to be model independent and therefore insensitive to the microscopic physics underlying the low energy effective theory .",
    "the essence of this effect is the dimensional reduction @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) in the dynamics of fermion pairing in a magnetic field .",

    "we extend our previous investigation of the d3/d5 set up in an external magnetic field to the case of finite temperature",
    ". however , we are not only interested in expanding the description of the pseudo - goldstone modes to the finite temperature case but also to study the effect that the external magnetic field has on the confinement / deconfinement phase transition .",

    "it is demonstrated that unlike the 1 + 3 dimensional case ( the d3/d7 set up ) in the 1 + 2 case the competing effect of the magnetic field and the temperature is present even at large bare masses .",
    "this gives the possibility to tune the condensate of the theory to zero for arbitrarily large masses .",
    "the reason for that could be that unlike in the d3/d7 set up the external magnetic field does not require new counter terms in the holographic regularization of the d - brane action .",

    "let us write down the equation of motion ( [ fluctthet ] ) for the fluctuations of the @xmath252 embedding : @xmath255 next we focus on the @xmath256 case and consider the substitution @xmath257 .",
    "the equation of motion is written as : @xmath258 equation ( [ eqnfluctx ] ) has four regular singularities @xmath259 with exponents @xmath260 , @xmath261 , @xmath262 , @xmath263 . upon the change of variables : @xmath264 equation ( [ eqnfluctx ] ) takes the standard form of a heun equation @xmath265 with parameters : @xmath266 next we look for solutions of equation ( [ heun ] ) satisfying @xmath267 .",
    "this selects solutions of equation ( [ thet0 ] ) obeying ingoing boundary condition at the horizon ( @xmath268 ) and an appropriate behaviour at infinity ( @xmath269 ) .",
    "the method that we use is the one employed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the d3/d7 set up .",
    "we consider a frobenius series near @xmath268 satisfying the recursion relation : @xmath270 where @xmath271 and @xmath272 are given by : @xmath273 and @xmath274 , @xmath275 .",
    "next we define a continued fraction @xcite , @xcite : @xmath276 the convergency condition is given by : @xmath277 to obtain approximate expression for @xmath278 we cut the recursive relation at some sufficiently large @xmath279 ( @xmath280 in our case ) and use the asymptotic expression for @xmath281 : @xmath282 next we solve the resulting algebraic equation for @xmath283 . the spectrum for the first 11 lowest quasi - normal modes is given in table [ table1 ] .    .[table1]quasi - normal modes for the first 11 excited states .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     qualitatively the spectrum of quasi - normal modes has the same structure as the one for the d3/d7 system studied in ref . @xcite .",
    "as one can see from the plot in table [ table1 ] for large @xmath284 the quasi - normal modes satisfy the approximate relation : @xmath285    if we apply the numerical techniques used to generate the spectrum in figure [ fig : fig11 ] to obtain the spectrum presented in table [ table1 ] we find that the results agree with relative error of @xmath286 ( for the lowest quasi - normal modes ) .",
    "a more complete and detailed study of the spectrum of quas - normal modes for non - zero magnetic field is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however analysis of equation ( [ thet0 ] ) shows that as the magnetic field increases the lowest lying modes given in table [ table1 ] shift radially away from the origin .",
    "furthermore a new set of quasi - normal modes with vanishing real part emerges .",
    "the lowest lying of these modes is the one analyzed in the previous subsection .",
    "as one can see from figure [ fig : fig11 ] for sufficiently large magnetic fields this mode becomes tachyonic .",
    "if we keep on increasing the magnetic field more and more tachyonic modes emerge . in the strict @xmath127 limit ( corresponding to vanishing temperature )",
    "the spectrum contains an infinite tower of tachyonic modes .",
    "the qualitative behaviour is similar to the one described in @xcite where the zero temperature spectrum for the d3/d7 set up was explored .",
    "in this subsection we study fluctuations along @xmath201 and @xmath202 . since translations along @xmath201 and @xmath202 correspond to the generators of the spontaneously broken @xmath287 symmetry for small bare masses we expect to detect pseudo - goldstone modes .",
    "this is why we focus on the spectrum in the confined phase .",
    "the spectrum at zero temperature has been extensively studied in ref .",
    "we expect that the qualitative behaviour at finite temperature will remain the same in the confined phase .",
    "the equations of motion derived from the quadratic action ( [ qvfl ] ) are the following : @xmath288 where @xmath289 is give in equation ( [ box ] ) .",
    "next we consider a plane - wave ansatz : @xmath290 now using the anzatz ( [ anzatsqv ] ) we get : @xmath291 the equations of motion in ( [ coupled ] ) can be decoupled by the definition @xmath292 .",
    "the result is : @xmath293 we can now solve numerically the equations of motion by imposing boundary conditions : @xmath294 for sufficiently small @xmath295 .",
    "the spectrum is quantized by requiring that @xmath296 for large @xmath297 . since we are interested in the confined phase we consider @xmath298 .",
    "the resulting spectrum is presented in figure [ fig : fig12 ] ,     versus @xmath92 .",
    "one can observe a zeeman splitting of the energy levels at large bare masses @xmath92 . and the existence of a pseudo - goldstone mode at small bare masses.,width=453 ]    where we have introduced dimensionless parameters @xmath299 and @xmath300 .",
    "as one can see for large bare masses there is a zeeman splitting of the energy levels , and the spectrum approximates to the spectrum for zero temperature and magnetic field studied in refs .  , where the authors obtained the following relation : @xmath301 between the eigenvalue of the @xmath302 excited state @xmath303 and the bare mass @xmath41 . the black fitting lines in figure [ fig : fig12 ] correspond to equation ( [ purespect ] ) .",
    "it is also evident that at zero bare mass the ground state has zero frequency .",
    "this is the goldstone mode of the broken @xmath287 symmetry .",
    "note that we have broken two generators while we observe only a single goldstone mode .",
    "this is the same behaviour as in the zero temperature case studied in ref .",
    "the apparent contradiction is clarified by the observation that the so(1,2 ) lorentz symmetry is broken down to @xmath218 rotational symmetry ( by both the external magnetic field and the finite temperature ) .",
    "this opens the possibility of having two types of goldstone modes : type i and type ii satisfying odd and even dispersion relations correspondingly . in this case",
    "there is a modified counting rule ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) which states that _ the number of gbs of type i plus twice the number of gbs of type ii is greater than or equal to the number of broken generators . _",
    "another interesting feature of the set up is that for small bare masses the pseudo - goldstone modes satisfy a modified gell - mann - oaks - renner relation @xcite .",
    "indeed as it can be seen from the plot in figure [ fig : fig13 ] we have a linear relation ( as opposed to square root one ) between the frequency @xmath283 and the bare mass @xmath92 .     and of the non - relativistic dispersion relation of the pseudo - goldstone modes.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   and of the non - relativistic dispersion relation of the pseudo - goldstone modes.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]",
    "it turns out that the slope of the observed linear relation is given by : @xmath304 where @xmath305 represents the condensate at zero bare mass .",
    "in fact one can prove a more general result : @xmath306 where @xmath307 and we have defined @xmath308 .",
    "let us first verify the dispersion relation from equation ( [ disprel ] ) numerically . to do this end we consider a d5-brane embedding with a very small bare mass @xmath309 .",
    "next we generate a plot of @xmath283 versus @xmath310 for fixed @xmath311 .",
    "the resulting plot is presented in figure [ fig : fig13 ] .",
    "the black fitting curve corresponds to the relation : @xmath312 on the other side the expression for @xmath313 form equation ( [ gama ] ) is @xmath314 and by calculating numerically @xmath315 and for @xmath309 we obtain @xmath316 .",
    "one can see that the relative error is @xmath317 and @xmath318 correspondingly .",
    "the analytic prove of the dispersion relation in equation ( [ disprel ] ) is a generalization of the zero temperature case considered in ref .",
    "let us briefly provide the proof .",
    "let us consider the limit of small @xmath238 in equation ( [ decoupled ] ) thus leaving only the linear potential term in @xmath238 .",
    "@xmath319 note that we have written down equation ( [ eqet+ ] ) in the dimensionless variables defined previously and used the notation @xmath320 .",
    "it is convenient to define the following variables : @xmath321 then equation  ( [ eqet+ ] ) can be written as : @xmath322 where the overdots represent derivatives with respect to @xmath297 .",
    "now if we take the limit @xmath323 and @xmath324 we have that @xmath325 and obtain that : @xmath326 is a solution to equation ( [ xi ] ) .",
    "our next step is to consider small @xmath92 and expand : @xmath327 where the variations @xmath328 and @xmath329 are vanishing in the @xmath323 limit . then , to leading order in @xmath92 ( keeping in mind that @xmath330 and @xmath331 ) we obtain : @xmath332 now we multiply equation ( [ prib ] ) by @xmath333 and integrate along @xmath334 .",
    "the result is : @xmath335 using the definitions of @xmath336 and @xmath337 and requiring regularity at infinity for @xmath338 , one can show that the first term in equation  ( [ intermid ] ) vanishes and that : @xmath339 and hence using that @xmath340 we obtain equation ( [ disprel ] ) which we duplicate below : @xmath341 further analysis of the pseudo goldstone spectrum would involve derivation of the effective chiral action along the lines of ref .  @xcite .",
    "we leave such studies for future investigations .",
    "in this paper we studied flavoured holographic 1 + 2 dimensional yang - mills theory at finite temperature in an external magnetic field .",
    "one of the main results of our studies was the construction of the phase diagram of the theory in section 3 .",
    "it seems that the observed structure of the phase diagram can be understood based on rather general grounds . at a weak magnetic field",
    "the observed quadratic behaviour in figure [ fig : fig4 ] can be understood as representing the fact that the theory is describable by a born - infield like action and hence the free energy is an even function of the magnetic field .",
    "the square root behaviour at large magnetic fields on the other side represents competition of energy scales and thus is consequence of the freezing effect that the magnetic field has on the phase transition .",
    "perhaps this could explain why the phase diagram in the coordinates used in figure [ fig : fig3 ] has the same shape as the phase diagram of the 1 + 3 dimensional case studied in refs .",
    "the similarity with the phase diagram of the gross - neveu model in 1 + 2 dimensions studied in refs .",
    "@xcite could perhaps also be interpreted along these lines .",
    "it would be interesting to use alternative non - perturbative techniques to study the phase diagram of the defect field theory holographically dual to our set up and compare with the result obtained via the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "interesting feature of the theory is the observation that the magnetic field and the temperature have the same effect on the theory for large bare masses .",
    "this is to be contrasted to the results for the d3/d7 set up .",
    "more precisely this suggests that one can tune the sign of the condensate at large bare masses .",
    "furthermore , one has analytic control on that regime of the theory .",
    "it is worth looking for possible applications of this property of the system .",
    "another interesting feature of the theory is the enhanced relative jump of the entropy at zero bare mass",
    ". it would be interesting to employ alternative methods and explore the jump of entropy .",
    "for example by counting how the number of microstates changes .",
    "it is also intriguing that the ratio of the entropy before and after the phase transition seems to be numerically very close to @xmath147 suggesting that perhaps this ratio can be obtained in a closed form .",
    "a possible direction for future studies is the derivation of the temperature dependence of the condensate of the theory at zero bare mass , using alternative field theory approach . in general such studies",
    "could verify the validity of the holographic set up .",
    "an interesting property of the d3/d5 set up is that the holographic renormalization of the d5-brane action does not require additional counter terms due to the external electric or magnetic field .",
    "this enables one to define unambiguously the magnetization of the theory .",
    "this observation suggests that d5-brane probing of more complicated asymptotically ads@xmath10 geometries would still have the same property .",
    "it would also be interesting to further analyze the temperature dependence of the diamagnetic response in the deconfined phase and attempt to model that dependence based on the control that we have on the temperature dependence of other properties of the theory , such as the conductivity .",
    "the meson spectrum of the theory could also be analyzed in more details .",
    "for example a more complete study of the spectrum of quasi - normal modes including non - zero bare masses .",
    "finally , studies of the effective chiral action along the lines of the studies performed in @xcite are of potential phenomenological interest .",
