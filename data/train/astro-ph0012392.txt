    "among the best - studied galaxies beyond the local group is the nearby sab spiral m81 ( ngc 3031 ) . with an inclination of 59@xmath7 , a dominant two - armed spiral pattern , and a well - defined central bulge",
    ", m81 is ideal for investigating formation and evolution of galaxies similar to our own .",
    "most x - ray studies of m81 have concentrated on the dominant source in the field , a low - luminosity agn at its core .",
    "the only extensive examination of the entire m81 field at x - ray energies is that of fabbiano ( 1988 , hereafter f88 ) based on _",
    "einstein _  observations . _ einstein",
    "_  detected 9 sources in m81 including the nucleus , all with x - ray luminosities exceeding @xmath8 ergs  s@xmath6 , with 5 of these located along spiral arms .",
    "we have identified an additional 9 sources within a @xmath26@xmath9 radius of the nucleus from archival _ rosat _  observations .    in this first examination of a _ chandra _",
    "x - ray observatory observation of m81 , we analyze the global properties of the 97 x - ray sources detected in the inner @xmath10 field to a limiting 0.2 - 8 kev luminosity of @xmath11 ergs - s@xmath6 .",

    "the hardness ratio distribution is presented in ",
    "[ s : spectral ] and the log@xmath3-log@xmath4  distribution in   [ s : photometry ] .",
    "section  [ s : temporal ] discusses the luminosity evolution of sources common to the _ einstein _  ( c.1980 ) , _ rosat _  ( @xmath21990 ) and present _ chandra _  observations .",
    "the results are summarized in   [ s : summary ] .",
    "detailed analysis of individual sources are deferred to a future paper .",
    "a 49926 second observation of a portion of the galaxy m81 was obtained with the _ chandra _  advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis , g. p. garmire et al . , in preparation ) on 2000 may 7 .",
    "the primary target , sn 1993j , was located near the nominal aimpoint on the back - illuminated ccd s3 of the spectroscopy array ( operating in imaging mode ) .",
    "the nucleus of m81 lies 2.@xmath979 from sn 1993j towards the center of s3 in this observation .",
    "the observation was taken in faint time exposure mode at 3.241 s - frame@xmath6 .",
    "chandra _",
    "x - ray center processing has applied aspect corrections and compensated for spacecraft dither .",
    "we selected the standard grade set and events in pulse invariant ( pi ) channels corresponding to @xmath12 to @xmath13 kev for analysis .",
    "the majority of sources identified are within the @xmath10 field of s3 . to avoid difficulties with the intrinsic differences between front- and back - illuminated devices",
    "we restrict our analysis to ccd s3 . due to poor cosmic ray rejection for the central two columns of s3 , all events with chipx equal to 512 or 513",
    "were excluded from analysis . since these columns are dithered across the sky , their removal results in a slight loss of sensitivity ( 5% ) in the central @xmath14 .",
    "pixels with centers less than @xmath15 from the readout trail of the nucleus were flagged and excluded from analysis as were pixels containing less than 50% sky exposure near the edge of the ccd .",
    "sources were located using a minimum variance estimator that compares the data to the telescope point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "this method is most suited to finding point sources that roughly match the telescope s psf .",
    "the psf was approximated by a circular gaussian with the same width as the measured psf at the aimpoint and increasing quadratically with distance from the aimpoint to approximately match the core and off - axis broadening of the true psf .",
    "we define the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) to be the estimated source counts divided by the 1@xmath16 uncertainity in this number . to set a minimum threshold , we considered the number of sources found per s / n interval down to a minimum s / n of 1.0 .",
    "this distribution shows a clear gaussian noise peak at low s / n that indicates a single false detection ( on s3 ) is to be expected for a minimum s / n of 3.0 and less than 0.1 false detections at a threshold of 3.5 .",
    "we include all sources with s / n@xmath173.0 in our analysis with the exception of the spectral analysis (   [ s : spectral ] ) and log@xmath3-log@xmath4  analysis (   [ s : photometry ] ) for which only s / n@xmath173.5 sources are considered .    a second pass , designed to mitigate source confusion , was made through the data . for this purpose ,",
    "all pixels within 2@xmath16 of each source position were flagged and the source - finding process repeated . in this way , the variance in the local background due to nearby sources is greatly reduced and otherwise confused sources isolated .",
    "an additional 6 sources , 4 with s / n@xmath173.5 , were detected .",
    "the final source list contained 81 sources with s / n@xmath183.5 with an additional 16 with 3.0@xmath19s / n@xmath203.5 .",
    "these source positions are identified in the acis data shown in figure  1a and superimposed on the second generation digital sky survery ( dss ) image in figure  1b .",
    "small spatial regions centered on each source were then selected for further analysis .",
    "the size of these spatial regions also varies quadratically with off - axis position and encompasses roughly the 95% encircled energy radii of the psf at 1.5 kev .",
    "no correction for the low background , @xmath20.04 cts - pixel@xmath6 , is made .",
    "for spectral analysis (   [ s : spectral ] ) , the total counts within each source region were binned into soft ( 0.2    2.0 kev ) and hard ( 2.0    8.0 kev ) bands .",
    "higher resolution spectra , at 16 pi channel binning out to @xmath210 kev , were examined for spurious effects such as anomolously high background .",
    "no anomolies were encountered .",
    "finally , we distinguish between the ` bulge ' and ` disk ' defined here as those regions internal and external , respectively , to a @xmath21 ellipse centered on the nucleus with major axis position angle 149@xmath7 ( cf .",
    "figure  1 ) .",
    "this ellipse corresponds to a circle in the plane of the galaxy of radius @xmath22 ( @xmath22.5 kpc ) .",
    "there is extended , unresolved x - ray flux in the bulge that is above background and is not due to the psf wings of the nucleus nor to other point sources .",
    "this component will be referred to as ` excess bulge emission . '",
    "the bulge contains 41 sources at a surface density of 5.4 sources - arcmin@xmath23 and the disk contains 56 sources ( on s3 ) at a density of @xmath21.0 source - arcmin@xmath23 . among the latter , 21 are located within @xmath24400 pc of spiral arms ( as defined by matonick & fesen ( 1997 ) by tracing the h@xmath25 emission peak , their figure 31b ) .",
    "the surface density of spiral arm sources in our sample is slightly less than , but statistically consistent with , the surface density of disk sources not associated with spiral arms .",
    "the surface density distribution of bulge sources , inclination - corrected and centered on the nucleus , can be described by an exponential radial distribution , @xmath26 , with @xmath27 kpc . after subtracting the background component and the contribution from the wings of the psf of the nucleus , the surface brightness profile of the excess bulge emission can also be described by an exponential with scale length @xmath28 kpc for @xmath29 .",
    "the excess bulge emission is much steeper at smaller radii though a residual contribution from the wings of the nuclear psf can not be definitively excluded . beyond @xmath30 kpc ,",
    "these profiles are roughly consistent with the @xmath31 ( georgiev & getov 1991 ) , @xmath32 ( frei et al .",
    "1996 ) , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1984 ) profiles suggesting the bulge x - ray emission follows the distribution of starlight .    a search of the literature for known objects spatially coincident with _",
    "chandra _  sources found no matches within the bulge , with the exception of the nucleus . among the disk sources ,",
    "5 are located within @xmath35 of supernova remnants ( snr ; matonick & fesen 1997 ) including sn  1993j and the bright _ einstein _",
    "source x-6 ( f88 ) .",
    "all 5 snr candidates lie on spiral arms as expected for young , massive star , type ii supernova progenitors .",
    "source x-6 is a point source located within a 90-pc - diameter snr ( matonick & fesen 1997 ) .",
    "the high luminosity and hard spectrum (   [ s : spectral ] ) of x-6 is uncharacteristic of snrs .",
    "six x - ray sources , all located within spiral arms , are within @xmath36 of known hii regions , half of which are giant radio hii regions ( kaufman et al .",
    "one of these x - ray sources , though weak , has the hardest spectrum of the entire source sample (   [ s : spectral ] ) .",
    "no x - ray sources were found to coincide with known globular clusters , novae , or stars .",
    "roughly 10% of globular clusters are expected to contain accreting neutron stars detectable above our threshold and galaxies like m81 typically contain of order 200 globular clusters ( perelmuter & racine 1995 ) . however , there are only 25 confirmed globular clusters in m81 ( perelmuter , brodie & huchra , 1995 ) and only 4 within the s3 field .",
    "the nova rate in m81 is probably of order 20 year@xmath6 ( a. w. shafter , private communication ) .",
    "the x - ray signatures and light curves of novae are only sparsely documented ( gelman , krautte & beuermann 1987 ) making novae difficult to identify in our source sample .",
    "there are two sources , _ einstein _",
    "source x-2 and a _",
    "rosat_-detected object , which are near stars or star clusters .",
    "x-2 is @xmath37 distant from a star cluster with a spectrum consistent with g - type stars ( sholukhova et al . 1998 ) .",
    "zickgraf & humphreys ( 1991 ) list the optical object as a probable foreground f - type dwarf .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "source is coincident with an undocumented @xmath218-magnitude object visible in the digital sky survey image .",
    "interestingly , both x - ray sources are transient and have been much brighter in the past (   [ s : temporal ] ) .",
    "no known background or foreground objects were found coincident with the s3 _ chandra _  sources . up to @xmath225 background objects",
    "are expected in the s3 field above s / n  @xmath38 based upon our analysis of the calibration field crss j0030.5 + 2618 ( see also brandt et al .  2000 ) .",
    "this estimate ignores any obscurtion by m81 .",
    "based on results of the _ einstein _   stellar survey ( topka et al .",
    "1982 ) , we estimate roughly 0.4 f-  and g - stars could be detectable in our field but these should all be extremely soft ( maggio et al .",
    "1987 , hodgkin & pye 1994 , schmitt 1997 ) .",
    "a soft spectrum was observed from 3 catalogued stars detected on ccd s2 .",
    "the total source counts in the hard x - ray band ( 2.0    8.0 kev ) is shown in figure  2 against the soft ( 0.2    2.0 kev ) band for the subset of sources with s / n@xmath183.5 excluding the nucleus .",
    "there is no adjustment for pileup which tends to harden spectra of the brightest sources . also shown",
    "are the hardness ratios of the sum of all the bulge sources , and of all the disk sources , the hardness ratio of the excess bulge emission ( background and nuclear psf subtracted ) , and of the typical background ( scaled to a @xmath39 area ) .",
    "the nucleus and the bright soft source are omitted from the summed bulge point , and x-6 is omitted from the summed disk point as these sources are clearly spectroscopically atypical .",
    "the line shown corresponds to an absorbed power law of spectral index @xmath40 , typical of x - ray binaries , with the galactic absorbing column density of @xmath41 cm@xmath23 ( stark et al .",
    "1992 ) . though indicative and useful to guide the eye ,",
    "this canonical spectral shape is not a model fit result .",
    "most sources fall near this curve .",
    "notable exceptions are the soft sources at the lower right of figure  2 .",
    "the softest bulge sources have no known associations but the 3 softest disk sources all lie on spiral arms .",
    "the softest source is also time - variable (   [ s : temporal ] ) and is the third brightest source in the entire sample .",
    "the hardness ratios for the summed bulge and summed disk spectra are also typical of x - ray binaries .",
    "the excess bulge emission is softer indicating some of the excess emission is from truly diffuse , hot , interstellar gas and not entirely from unresolved point sources .",
    "the number of sources above a limiting brightness , @xmath43@xmath44 , is shown against the 0.2    8.0 kev count rate , @xmath4 , in figure  3 . the nucleus is excluded as are sources with s / n@xmath203.5 .",
    "background sources were taken from the calibration field crss j0030.5 + 2618 (   [ s : spatial ] ) , by applying our same analysis methods , and have been subtracted after scaling to the fractional areas of the bulge and disk .",
    "the curve shown in figure  3 represents the best power law fit to the disk distribution , @xmath45 , over the entire range of @xmath4 .",
    "similarly , @xmath46 for the bulge source distribution for @xmath4@xmath200.004 count - s@xmath6 . there is a break in the slope of the distribution of bulge sources above this point but no such break in the disk source distribution . of the 10 disk sources with @xmath4@xmath170.004 count - s@xmath6 , 7 are coincident with spiral arms .",
    "the luminosity of each source can be estimated by assuming the @xmath40 power law spectral model of   [ s : spectral ] and a distance of 3.6 mpc to m81 ( freedman et al .",
    "1994 ) . for our 50-ks observation",
    ", therefore , @xmath47 count - s@xmath6 in the 0.2  ",
    "8.0 kev band corresponds to a luminosity @xmath48 ergs s@xmath6 and the faintest source in the field corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath49 ergs s@xmath6 .",
    "excluding the nucleus , the total bulge luminosity is @xmath50 erg s@xmath6 of which 36% is excess ( unresolved ) emission .",
    "the total luminosity of the disk sources is @xmath51 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "the luminosity of the nucleus is @xmath52 erg s@xmath6 based on spectral fits to the trailed image .",
    "this is within the asca - observed range of luminosities ( ishisaki et al .",
    "1996 ) and comparable to the bepposax observed luminosity ( pellegrini et al .",
    "the nucleus contributes approximately 86% of the total luminosity in the @xmath0 s3 field of view .",
    "a simple test for time variability was made by binning the light curves of all sources on 1000 , 2000 , and 4000 second intervals . applying a @xmath53 test for the hypothesis of consistency with a mean value found only one clearly significant deviation on all three timescales .",
    "this source is also the softest source on s3 and the third brightest .",
    "it is present in at least 3 of 6 _ rosat _  hri observations spanning 1993  -  1998 but is too close to the nucleus to be identified in any other previous x - ray observation .",
    "m81 has been observed in x - rays at moderate spatial resolution by _",
    "einstein _  in 1979 and by _ rosat _  over the period 19911998 .",
    "there are 6 _ einstein _  sources ( f88 ) within the s3 field of view and another 4 _ rosat_-detected sources according to our analysis .",
    "_ chandra _  resolves six _ rosat _  source regions into two or more sources including _ einstein _",
    "sources x-7 and x-10 , and , of course , the nucleus .",
    "long - term variability has been detected in the _ chandra _  variable source , the nucleus , x-2 and the _ rosat_-detected source coincident with an undocumented star - like object (   [ s : spatial ] ) .",
    "both of the latter sources are moderately weak in the present observations ( @xmath23 and @xmath54 ergs - s@xmath6 , respectively ) but have been much brighter in the past .",
    "the location of another _ einstein _  source , x-12 , places it on the eastern edge of s3 .",
    "there are no _ chandra _  sources within the portion of the 45@xmath55 error circle of this ipc source that falls on s3 and it is not detectable in the _ rosat _  observations .",
    "the global properties of the _ chandra _  sources identified in the central @xmath0 region of m81 have been examined .",
    "there is a high density of sources located in the bulge of the galaxy .",
    "these sources , and the excess bulge x - ray emission , follow an exponential radial distribution about the nucleus with an @xmath21 kpc scale length .",
    "this is similar to that of optical light and suggests the excess bulge emission is from unresolved point sources and that the point sources trace the old stellar bulge population .",
    "however , extrapolating the bulge log@xmath3-log@xmath4  distribution towards weaker sources predicts @xmath20.022 source counts - s@xmath6 from sources @xmath200.001 counts - s@xmath6-source@xmath6 .",
    "thus , weak sources can only account for 20% of the total excess bulge emission ( @xmath20.092 counts - s@xmath6 ) .",
    "there remains a significant flux in the bulge unaccounted for by unresolved sources , particularly at lower energies , indicative of a truly diffuse , hot interstellar gas . if all the excess bulge emission arises from a diffuse thermal bremsstrahlung at @xmath56 kev , uniformly distributed throughout the bulge",
    ", then there is @xmath57 @xmath58 of hot gas .",
    "the average hardness ratio of the _ chandra _  sources can be described by a power law of index @xmath59 with a galactic absorbing column density of @xmath41 cm@xmath23 .",
    "this is typical of x - ray binaries .",
    "assuming thie canonical spectrum applies to all sources , the background source subtracted log@xmath3-log@xmath4  distribution of the disk sources follows an @xmath60 profile extending to the most luminous sources at @xmath61 ergs - s@xmath6 .",
    "the distribution of bulge sources , however , shows a break at @xmath62 ergs - s@xmath6 .",
    "thus the bulge sources are predominantly low - mass x - ray binaries , consistent with an old bulge stellar population , while the disk has an additional population of much brighter sources .",
    "seven of the 10 brightest _ chandra _  disk sources lie within spiral arms , consistent with previous _",
    "einstein _  observations ( f88 ) , but the entire sample of disk sources , down to the limiting _ chandra _",
    "luminosity of @xmath49 ergs - s@xmath6 , are distributed throughout the disk without preference to spiral arms .",
    "some of these brighter sources may be black hole candidates with high - mass companions .",
    "we thank martin weisskopf for deriving the expression for the uncertainty in the source flux used in the source - finding algorithm .",
    "the digital sky survey image used in figure 1b is from the `` palomar observatory - space telescope science institute digital sky survey '' of the northern sky , based on scans of the second palomar sky survey , and was produced under nasa contract nas5 - 2555 .",
