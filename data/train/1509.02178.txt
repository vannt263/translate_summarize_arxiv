    "if @xmath1 is constant , the condition is precisely the definition that was proposed by lott , sturm and villani in @xcite .",
    "the condition @xmath4 has geometric consequences as a generalized bishop - gromov estimates and a generalized bonnet - myers theorem .",
    "but it can not recognize riemannian - type spaces which are characterized by linearity of the induced heat flow of their cheeger energy . in the context of constant lower curvature bounds",
    "this obstacle was resolved by ambrosio , gigli and savar in @xcite who showed that displacement convexity in combination with linearity of the heat flow is equivalent to the existence of gradient flow curves in the sense of an _ evolution variational inequality _",
    "( @xmath9 ) for the boltzmann entropy on the @xmath6-wasserstein .",
    "there are two important extensions of this idea . on the one hand ,",
    "erbar , kuwada and sturm @xcite introduce a finite dimensional version of the @xmath9-formula to define a riemannian curvature - dimension condition . as part of their program",
    "they also introduce a so - called _ entropic curvature - dimension conditon _ that is a more @xmath10-friendly modification of the original @xmath11-condition . on the other hand ,",
    "sturm @xcite defines @xmath12-gradient flow curves where @xmath1 is a lower semi - continuous function .",
    "he proves several implications and equivalences , and also stability of this concept under measured gromov convergence .    in this note",
    "we introduce a riemannian curvature - dimension condition for variable lower curvature bounds . for this purpose , we study @xmath0-convex functions on metric spaces where @xmath7 is lower semi - continuous .",
    "we use a new characterization of @xmath0-convexity in terms of an integrated inequality @xcite that involves so - called generalized dirstortion coefficients @xmath13 ( defintion [ generaldist ] , defintion [ ahr ] ) .",
    "provided the metric space @xmath14 admits a first variation formula , we can deduce an evolution variational inequality for gradient flow curves of @xmath0-convex functions .",
    "more precisely , we say that an absolutely continuous curve @xmath15 is an @xmath16 gradient flow curve of @xmath17 starting in @xmath18 if @xmath19 , and if for all @xmath20 there exists a constant speed geodesic @xmath21\\rightarrow x$ ] between @xmath22 and @xmath23 such that the _ evolution variational inequality _",

    "moreover , the entropic curvature - dimension condition already implies local compactness and finite hausdorff dimension of the underlying metric measure space .",
    "then , we introduce a riemannian curvature - dimension that is defined via combination of the entropic curvature - dimension condition and linearity of the heat flow . we show that the riemannian curvature - dimension condition can be characterized by the existence of _",
