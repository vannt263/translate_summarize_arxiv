    "measurements of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) provide a snapshot of the universe some 380,000 years after the big bang , when the primordial plasma decouples from the baryons .",
    "the power spectrum of the anisotropy is computed with a line of sight integration of the coupled boltzmann equations between now and some time well before decoupling @xcite ( hereafter paper 1 ) .",
    "this formalism may be extended to consider future times when the decoupling surface is further away from us .",
    "we may think of this as investigating an expanding cmb photosphere .",
    "of course we do not know the details of the gravitational landscape beyond the current photosphere and so we can only probe the future in a statistical sense .",
    "the conformal time of the decoupling surface in a flat universe is obtained from the friedmann equation as follows : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the scale factor , @xmath3 is the current hubble parameter , @xmath4 is the current radiation density relative to the critical density , @xmath5 is the current matter density relative to the critical density , and @xmath6 is the current dark energy density relative to the critical density . at all times @xmath7 . with parameters inspired by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite ,",

    "to perform our study , we use camb @xcite which follows the algorithm in seljak and zaldarriga s cmbfast @xcite .",
    "we consider only scalar perturbations .",
    "we modified the camb code so that it computes the following evolution function ( eq . 13 in paper 1 )    @xmath25d\\tau\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 is the source function , @xmath27 is a spherical bessel function , @xmath28 is the conformal time , and @xmath29 is the comoving wavevector of the perturbation .",
    "the modification allows for arbitrary final @xmath28 ( as opposed to fixing @xmath30 ) .",
    "the source function is given by @xmath31\\ ] ] where @xmath32 represents polarization terms ( see eq . 12 in paper 1 ) which we ignore for simplicity . here",

    "( [ eqn : source_3 ] ) differs from eq . 12 in paper 1 only in the overall @xmath38 term which accounts for the changing optical depth . the first order term in the expansion of the boltzmann equation , @xmath39 ( eq . 3a in paper 1 ) , the potentials @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the velocity of the baryons @xmath42 , and the polarization terms are computed by camb and need no modification .",
    "the primary modification to camb is to calculate @xmath26 out to @xmath43 , rather than to @xmath35 .",
    "variable to the maximum @xmath43 in which we are interested .",
    "this is valid because in the code the concept of the `` present '' is linked to @xmath12 ( which we do not modify ) , rather than to @xmath44 . ] in addition , some of camb s optimizations that led to sparse sampling at recent times were removed .    to compute the power spectrum at any time in the future we simply form the analog of eq 9 in paper 1 : @xmath45dk\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the initial power spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig : ps1 ] shows the power spectrum for future times .",
    "we see three major effects : ( 1 ) the power spectrum amplitude drops off due to the @xmath47 scaling of the cmb temperature ; ) and ( [ cmb : eqn : cl_8 ] ) are dimensionless ( since @xmath48 is dimensionless by definition ) .",
    "we give units to @xmath49 by multiplying by @xmath50 , accounting for this effect . ]",
    "( 2 ) the features shift to smaller angular scales due to the recession of the surface of last scattering ; ( 3 ) the low-@xmath51 tail becomes enhanced compared to the peak due to the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect caused by the shift to dark - energy dominance .",
    "the enhanced isw effect is not present in runs of the code without dark energy . in roughly @xmath52 years",
    ", the isw effect at @xmath53 will exceed the height of the first acoustic peak .",
    "to visualize the evolution of the cmb photosphere , we make maps of the sky for various physical time slices ( see table 1 ) . for any particular map , which we take as a gaussian random field ,",
    "all the information is contained in the power spectrum , @xmath54 , where the @xmath55 are the coefficients of a spherical harmonic decomposition of the map . to generate a visualization ,",
    "one draws @xmath56 random normal complex deviates , r , with variance @xmath57 to generate a set of @xmath58 @xmath59s that satisfy @xmath60 . from these one forms the real valued @xmath61 .",
    "a set of maps that shows the future evolution of the cmb will be correlated . to account for this ,",
    "we compute the full covariance matrix @xmath62dk,\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the conformal time at any time in the future .",
    "thus for a sequence of say @xmath64 maps , we would compute a @xmath65 matrix for each @xmath51 .",
    "we now extend the method given above to generate a set of correlated @xmath66s .",
    "the first step is to decompose the covariance matrix as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a diagonal matrix .",
    "we then compute @xmath69{\\mathbf r}$ ] where @xmath70 is a vector of complex random deviates .",
    "this @xmath71 has the covariance matrix in eq .",
    "[ eqn : c_l ]",
    ". figures  [ fig : maps1]-[fig : maps4 ] show a set of four time slices starting with a random full - sky map that follows the wmap parameters .",
    "one can see that most of the change occurs on small angular scales where the photosphere more quickly samples different potential wells as it expands .",
    "one also sees that as time progresses large angular scale fluctuations become more prominent as dark energy dominates the expansion .",
    "figure  [ fig : covariance_comp ] shows elements of the covariance matrix as a function of time .",
    "as expected , nearby time slices are strongly correlated .",
    "as time progresses the covariance between current and future time slices at small angular scales disappears first , and then later the covariance at large angles decreases .",
    "the time it takes for the scale factor to double , @xmath72y , gives a characteristic time for the future sky to decorrelate with what we observe today .",
    "figure  [ fig : correlation_comp ] gives the correlation of several time steps with the present . in this plot , the decrease in temperature has been scaled out so that features in the anisotropy may be compared directly . at high @xmath51 , features in the sky at late times are uncorrelated with those at present .",
    "however , at low @xmath51 , the late - time isw features remain correlated for @xmath73 billion years , indicating that these are very long lived structures .",
    "measuring the difference between two high precision maps of the anisotropy taken a century apart offers , in principle , a way to directly observe the expansion of the universe . unlike a measurement of the temperature of the cmb ,",
    "the difference between two maps is moderately insensitive to calibration .",
    "rather , it is a change in spatial structure that is observed .",
    "thus one needs a well understood pointing solution which is technically straightforward to achieve .",
    "figure  [ fig:100yrs ] shows the power spectrum of the difference between two maps taken 100 years apart .",
    "we use the formalism in knox ( 1995 ) to compute the experimental uncertainty . since there is just one sky realization , cosmic variance",
    "is ignored and the uncertainty per @xmath51 is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the fraction of sky covered , @xmath76 is the uncertainty per sky pixel of solid angle @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is the fwhm of the beam profile . for the uncertainty bands shown in figure  [ fig:100yrs ] , we imagine an array of 3000x3000 detectors at 150  ghz each with a sensitivity of 40  mks@xmath79 @xcite observing the sky with @xmath80 angular resolution",
    ". the observations would last 4 years , cover 75% of the sky , and would have to be done from a satellite .",
    "the only element not already demonstrated is large array .",
    "currently , arrays of 32x32 detectors are being built .",
    "the fundamental limit to such a measurement is likely to be variable point sources and variable foreground emission .",
    "though in principle these can be identified and removed spectrally , this capability would add complexity to the `` simple '' scheme outlined above .",
    "for comparison , there are currently experiments being designed with the sensitivity to measure the @xmath81 b - mode polarization .",
    "the improvement to go from these planned missions to measuring the signal we describe is on the order of the improvement between observations of the 1980s and the current observations .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge discussions with mike nolta , uros seljak and paul steinhardt .",
    "uros provided a key insight for computing and manipulating the covariance matrix in equation  [ eqn : c_l ] .",
