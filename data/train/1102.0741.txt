    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has been running since earlier last year in an initial phase of rediscovering the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "a variety of observables are necessary to completely measure the sm couplings and we concentrate here on the charge asymmetry , the hadron collider equivalent of the familiar forward - backward asymmetry . during the early stages of lhc running",
    ", the available event rates will possibly allow measurements of lepton charge asymmetries near the @xmath2 peak .",
    "these translate into measurements of the weak angle , @xmath3 , and can help in the sm rediscovery phase at lhc .    when the lhc is running at its design energy and luminosity",
    ", it will be possible to extend these measurements to higher regions of dilepton invariant mass , @xmath4 , not probed by lep ii , and in this way play an important role in the search for new physics .",
    "the drell - yan dilepton pair production process is important in this context due to its clean signature . in this paper",
    "we discuss the use of the lepton charge asymmetry as a tool to discover and identify new physics , with emphasis on the @xmath5-pair production channel .",
    "there exists a vast literature dedicated to the study of new physics associated with the top - quark , that is motivated by its large mass and possible unique role in electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "it is natural to ask whether new physics that singles out the top - quark does not in fact single out the whole third generation of the sm fermions .",
    "this is particularly the case in light of the existing anomaly in the forward - backward asymmetry of the @xmath6-quark @xcite .    with this in mind",
    ", we wish to explore the possibility of new physics that affects the tau - lepton but does not show up in studies of muons or electrons . to this effect",
    "we consider two different scenarios that single out the third generation leptons .",
    "the scenarios are not complete models , but instead they describe two simple possibilities .",
    "our first example is a non - universal @xmath1 which has been studied before in connection with the top - quark @xcite .",
    "here we explore its consequences in tau - lepton physics at the lhc in the large tau - pair invariant mass , @xmath7 region .",
    "it is possible that such a @xmath1 can be detected by simply looking for bumps in the @xmath7 distribution , but we emphasize here the question of detecting its effect via the lepton charge asymmetry .",
    "our second example consists of vector lepto - quarks which provide a benchmark for effects from non - resonant new physics . by associating the third family of leptons with the first family of quarks , the lepto - quarks in question single out the tau - lepton @xcite .",
    "we first present a study at the @xmath5-lepton level in section iii .",
    "in section iv , we back up our conclusions by considering selected @xmath5-lepton decay modes .",
    "forward - backward asymmetries have proved to be valuable tools for constraining the sm and searching for new physics in @xmath8 colliders .",
    "a prominent example being the @xmath9 anomaly measured at lep @xcite , which remains a hint for new physics @xcite .",
    "more recently the tevatron has reported an anomaly in the forward - backward asymmetry of the top - quark @xcite which has also received considerable attention @xcite .",
    "forward - backward asymmetries can still be defined for the lhc even though it is a symmetric @xmath10 collider .",
    "the idea is to consider processes that are initiated by @xmath11 annihilation at the parton level .",
    "it is then possible to define the forward - backward asymmetry in the usual way in the parton center - of - mass frame ( cm ) : the forward direction corresponding to the incoming quark direction . to connect with the @xmath10 collider , it is sufficient to recall that the quarks in the proton carry , on average , a larger fraction of the proton momentum than the anti - quarks , the direction of the quark momentum is thus correlated with the direction of the total momentum of the event in the lab frame ( the boost direction )",
    ".    specifically , one can start from the parton cm asymmetry defined in the usual way , @xmath12 where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is the respective cross - section for producing a lepton @xmath15 that travels forward ( backward ) with respect to the initial quark direction .",
    "this has been studied by both the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations in connection with measurements of @xmath3 from the sm asymmetries at the @xmath2 peak .    in the lab frame ,",
    "a non - vanishing @xmath16 will manifest itself as a rapidity asymmetry : the forward leptons in the parton center - of - mass will have a larger rapidity in the lab frame . at the lhc , the symmetry of the initial @xmath10 state results in a quark direction that is equally likely to correspond to either proton .",
    "the net effect of an @xmath16 in the lab frame at the lhc is a charge asymmetry in which the type of lepton that preferred the backward direction in the cm now concentrates in the central rapidity region .",
    "this charge asymmetry is in a sense equivalent to a forward backward asymmetry , but defined in lab frame for a symmetric @xmath10 collider . and @xmath17 in @xmath10 colliders . ]",
    "following this argument , it is common to define a charge asymmetry in terms of the fermion rapidity @xcite . in our case ,",
    "@xmath18 where @xmath19 is rapidity of the lepton @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the number of events with a given rapidity @xmath19 .",
    "one advantage of using this charge asymmetry over the forward - backward asymmetry in eq .",
    "[ afbstar ] is that the parton cm frame does not need to be reconstructed , as this reconstruction is not always possible .",
    "it is also common to define an integrated asymmetry over a central region , limited by @xmath22 : @xmath23 this integrated asymmetry can be optimized with a carefully chosen @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "notice that the symmetry of the initial @xmath10 state at lhc causes the integrated asymmetry to vanish when the whole rapidity range is used .",
    "finally , it may be convenient to integrate the charge asymmetry over different ranges of @xmath24 as we discuss below .",
    "in this section we describe briefly the two models we use to illustrate the effectiveness of the charge asymmetry and we present the corresponding numerical results .",
    "these two models are chosen because we are mostly interested in applications to @xmath5-lepton physics at lhc and both are examples of new physics that singles out the @xmath5-lepton .    in all cases we use madgraph 4.4.39 @xcite for event generation and pythia 6.4.21 @xcite for the analysis . to this end",
    "we implement the vertices that originate in each of the two new physics models directly into madgraph .",
    "we use cteq6l-1 parton distribution functions  @xcite .",
    "we also implement the basic acceptance cuts @xmath25 gev , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "our results will show that the measurements we propose will not be possible in the early running of lhc .",
    "for this reason we will assume a @xmath5 physics program when lhc is running at @xmath28  tev center - of - mass energy , and with an integrated luminosity of @xmath29 per year .",
    "we first carry out our analysis at the @xmath5-lepton level , without concerning ourselves with the subsequent @xmath5 decays .",
    "this will serve to assess the best case scenario of high efficiency @xmath5-lepton tagging and reconstruction as both cms and atlas expect to be able to detect @xmath5-leptons with relatively large efficiencies @xcite .",
    "we will then partially address these issues by considering a few selected @xmath5-lepton decay modes .",
    "the sm itself produces a non - zero charge asymmetry so that a search for new physics involves measuring the deviation from the sm .",
    "depending on the new physics , this deviation may be small and a precise measurement may be needed .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the charge asymmetry in the sm . within the sm , dileptons at the lhc",
    "are produced predominantly via @xmath30-channel exchange of a photon or a @xmath2 boson with a total cross - section ( for our acceptance cuts ) of @xmath31  pb at @xmath28  tev .",
    "the corresponding sm @xmath0 events exhibit an @xmath7 distribution shown in figure  [ fig : mllsm ] .",
    "this differential cross - section exhibits a clear @xmath2 peak and falls rapidly with @xmath7 . to distinguish possible new physics",
    "it is therefore useful to exclude the @xmath2 region and to look as far out in @xmath7 as the event rate permits .",
    "we will find that the best region to look for new physics ( at least in the two examples we consider ) is @xmath32  gev .",
    "our main observable is the integrated charge asymmetry over both rapidity , within a range determined by @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "previous studies related to the top - quark have shown that there is an optimal value for @xmath22 in eq .",
    "[ ycasym ]  @xcite and we illustrate this point within the context of the sm in figure  [ fig : acsm ] .",
    "this figure indicates that values around @xmath35 maximize the integrated charge asymmetry more or less independently from the @xmath36 value used .",
    "the selection of @xmath36 proceeds as discussed above : we want to exclude the @xmath2 peak region to minimize the effect of the sm as a background to the new physics without reducing the event rate too much .",
    "it turns out that the asymmetry increases with increasing @xmath36 ( at least up to the @xmath37  gev that we have tested ) and this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : acsm ] . as @xmath36 increases , this cut is more effective in rejecting events with a lower boost and this results in an increased asymmetry .",
    "the choice of a specific value for @xmath36 will thus result from a compromise between a somewhat larger asymmetry and reduced statistics as @xmath36 increases .",
    "we explore this further when we discuss results within the illustrative models .",
    "one of the most frequently studied extensions of the sm is an additional @xmath38 symmetry and its associated @xmath1 boson @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath38 charges are family universal in most of the models discussed in the literature , this need not be the case .",
    "it is well known that a non - universal @xmath1 induces tree - level flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) which are severely constrained by experiment , most notably meson mixing @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will not concern ourselves with the fcnc , but rather with the possibility of an enhanced coupling to the @xmath5-lepton as in the models of ref .",
    "@xcite , that can be probed at lhc .",
    "we write the general couplings of a non - universal @xmath1 boson to the sm fermions as follows , @xmath39 a model with an enhanced coupling @xmath40 singles out the @xmath5-lepton pair production process .",
    "of course , at lhc , we also need to know how the @xmath1 is produced and this forces us to specify its couplings to light quarks .",
    "we consider enhanced @xmath1 couplings to the third generation that are accompanied by correspondingly suppressed couplings to the light generations as happens in the models mentioned above .",
    "this results in a complete @xmath41 process that is of electroweak strength .",
    "existing constraints on this @xmath1 are twofold . from the lep - ii process",
    "@xmath42 considering both the cross - section and the forward - backward asymmetry as a function of @xmath7 , ref .",
    "@xcite concludes that masses @xmath43  gev are excluded .",
    "the phenomenology of such a @xmath1 at lhc vis - a - vis its enhanced couplings to the top - quark has also been considered both for flavor conserving @xcite , as well as flavor violating processes @xcite .",
    "it was found that the simple drell - yan - type processes are completely overwhelmed by qcd background .",
    "processes with three or four top ( or bottom ) quarks at the lhc could constrain the model for @xmath1 masses up to 2 tev , but several hundred fb@xmath44 of integrated luminosity would be necessary .    in this model ,",
    "the additional contribution to the partonic process @xmath45 is due to an s - channel @xmath46 exchange as shown in the figure  [ fig : fgzp ] .",
    "we consider two cases , corresponding to @xmath47  gev and @xmath48  tev . in both cases",
    "we will use a relatively narrow @xmath1 width of 100  gev . for illustration purposes we use purely",
    "right handed couplings with overall strength @xmath49 .",
    "exchange . ]    .dilepton pair cross - sections ( in pb ) for the @xmath50 model and the sm at the lhc with @xmath28 tev .",
    "all the masses shown here are given in tev .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , > , < , > , < , > , < \" , ]     these results show that the @xmath51 channel is less promising for using the charge asymmetry as a discriminator of new physics , but that it can still serve to distinguish some models .",
    "interestingly , the asymmetries in the @xmath52 channels , with the @xmath53 background removed at the monte carlo level , are not the same as those in the @xmath54 channels .",
    "this is due to the different effect of requiring the same minimum invariant mass for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , with the cut in @xmath55 being more efficient at rejecting sm background .",
    "the difference is simply due to the different kinematics for two - body decay vs three - body decay . as a consequence of this difference",
    "it would be difficult to combine the different channels to improve the statistical error even if the @xmath53 background could be controlled effectively .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry has been a very useful tool to obtain information about the sm couplings of fermions to the @xmath2 boson . at the lhc it will not always be possible to reconstruct a forward - backward asymmetry , but",
    "some of the same information can be obtained from charge asymmetries . in this paper",
    "we have emphasized that the charge asymmetry can also play an important role in the search for new physics in @xmath5-pair production at the lhc .",
    "we have investigated some kinematic properties of this charge asymmetry concluding that a value of @xmath22 near 0.5 is optimal in this case .",
    "the asymmetry can be constructed as a function of lepton pair invariant mass , @xmath7 , but a better probe of new physics is obtained by integrating the charge asymmetry over the available @xmath7 range with a minimum cut , @xmath36 .",
    "originally this cut serves the purpose of removing the sm @xmath2 background .",
    "we found that the integrated asymmetry increases by increasing @xmath36 far above the @xmath57 , although at the cost of lost statistics . we have explored the optimal value of @xmath36 in the context of two examples .",
    "we have illustrated two generic scenarios of new physics models that single out the @xmath5-lepton and would not show up in @xmath58 or @xmath8 pair production . we discuss a non - universal @xmath1 as an example of a new resonance that prefers to decay into tau - leptons .",
    "we also considered certain lepto - quarks as an example of non - resonant new physics .",
    "they single out the tau - lepton by associating the third generation leptons with the first generation quarks .",
    "we have illustrated examples of new physics that can induce @xmath5 charge asymmetries that are easy to distinguish from the sm .",
    "we have first presented an analysis of the charge asymmetry at the @xmath0 level based on the premise that @xmath0 samples have already been identified by the experiments .",
    "to back up our conclusions we have also studied selected @xmath5 decays with their associated backgrounds .",
    "we find that the dilepton modes are very clean to study the charge asymmetry .",
    "the lepton plus jet modes are less sensitive , but can still provide some discriminating power in the charge asymmetry .",
    "in conclusion we find that an experimental study of the @xmath5-lepton charge asymmetry at the lhc can provide valuable information in the search for new physics .",
    "clearly a detector level study by the experimental collaborations will be necessary to accurately quantify the possibilities of this proposal , and we encourage both atlas and cms to conduct such studies .",
    "many papers have been devoted to the interpretation of this result .",
