    "\\(i ) there is a natural homomorphism @xmath92 which takes @xmath93 to conjugation by @xmath94 restricted to the finite index subgroup @xmath95 .",
    "it follows from theorem [ ivanovkthm ] that this map is surjective . to show that it is injective , we observe that @xmath89 has trivial `` virtual centre '' , that is , any element which centralizes a finite index subgroup is necessarily trivial .",
    "this is because any mapping class @xmath96 is determined by its action on a finite number of isotopy classes of simple closed curves on the surface @xmath73 , and therefore by its action on the @xmath6-th powers @xmath97 of the corresponding dehn twists for any choice of @xmath6 .",
    "given a finite index subgroup @xmath98 centralized by @xmath99 we can always find a sufficiently large @xmath6 such that @xmath100 contains all @xmath97 .",
    "then @xmath99 is determined by its action on @xmath100 and so must be the identity in @xmath89 .",
    "\\(ii ) there is now an obvious homomorphism @xmath101 which factors through the inverse of the isomorphism just described , and realizes each automorphism of @xmath79 as conjugation by an element of @xmath89 .",
    "it follows easily that this map is injective with image precisely the normalizer @xmath88 of @xmath79 in @xmath89 .",

    "the centre @xmath41 of this mapping class group is generated by the dehn twist about a curve parallel to the boundary , and is precisely the kernel of the natural homomorphism to the mapping class group @xmath111 ( induced by inclusion of the punctured disk in @xmath47 ) .",

    "it is easily checked that @xmath88 is exactly the group of all mapping classes ( orientation preserving or not ) which leave @xmath142 setwise invariant .",

    ". statements ( i ) and ( ii ) now follow immediately from the corresponding statements in corollary [ normalizers ] .",
    "it is easy to see , with the aid of figure [ fig2 ] , that the short exact sequences in the proposition above are split in the cases @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the group @xmath146 may be generated by a reflection in the equatorial plane and a rotation about an axis in the equatorial plane which exchanges the points @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "only the reflection leaves @xmath112 invariant .    for @xmath114 , the exact sequence splits providing @xmath147 mod @xmath28 .",
    "to see this , think of @xmath47 as a sphere with @xmath148 punctures arranged symmetrically along the equator and , if @xmath149 , the remaining two punctures at the north and south poles .",

    "if @xmath154 is a puncture fixed by @xmath152 , then the orbit of @xmath154 under @xmath151 is preserved by @xmath150 , hence for an appropriate numbering of the punctures ( namely , so that @xmath155 ) the action of @xmath150 lies in @xmath156 and is faithful on @xmath142 .",
    "this splits the @xmath150 factor .",
    "the @xmath63 factor is realized by reflection through the equatorial plane .    [ nosplit ] if @xmath157 with @xmath158 mod @xmath28 , then @xmath156 does not contain a subgroup isomorphic to @xmath150 . in this case ,",
    "the exact sequence for @xmath114 in the previous proposition does not split .",
    "suppose @xmath159 contains a subgroup @xmath100 isomorphic to @xmath150 and let @xmath79 be the subgroup of @xmath100 generated by a 3-cycle .",
    "then @xmath79 is a subgroup of @xmath46 , hence @xmath79 acts by permutations on the set of punctures @xmath160 .",
    "every @xmath79 orbit consists of either @xmath110 or @xmath28 punctures . since @xmath161 , the number of fixed points of @xmath79 must also be congruent to @xmath110 mod @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath79 fixes @xmath162 or more punctures , then it lies in a subgroup of @xmath89 isomorphic to @xmath114 which is impossible since @xmath114 is torsion - free ( since , by @xcite , it is a subgroup of the braid group on @xmath37 strings which is known to be torsion free ) .",
    "thus @xmath79 must have a unique fixed puncture .",
    "since @xmath79 is normal in @xmath100 , all of @xmath100 must fix this puncture and hence @xmath100 lies in a subgroup of @xmath89 isomorphic to @xmath112 . by a theorem of bestvina , @xcite thm 4.5 , every finite subgroup of @xmath112 is cyclic , so we arrive at a contradiction .",
    "it has been observed by several authors @xcite@xcite@xcite that there exists a semidirect product decomposition @xmath163 ( see @xcite for further discussion of this decomposition . ) the coxeter graph of @xmath42 is an @xmath6-cycle and the generator of the cyclic factor in the semi - direct product acts on @xmath42 via an order @xmath6 rotation of this graph .",
    "the centre of @xmath66 is the subgroup @xmath164 of the cyclic factor .",
    "thus we also have @xmath165 here we interpret @xmath42 as the subgroup of @xmath113 consisting of mapping classes of `` zero angular momentum '' about the axis through the two fixed punctures .",
    "more precisely , suppose that the punctures of @xmath47 are arranged so that @xmath127 and @xmath128 are placed at the north and south pole respectively , and the remaining points @xmath166 are equally spaced ( in that cyclic order ) around the equator , see figure [ fig3 ] .",

    "there is an exact sequence @xmath174 where @xmath58 denotes the dihedral group of order @xmath175 .",
    "moreover , a splitting of this sequence is given by realizing the group of outer automorphisms as the direct product of the group of graph automorphisms of @xmath42 with the group of order @xmath176 generated by the inversion @xmath177 which inverts each standard generator .",
    "we suppose that the punctures of @xmath47 are arranged as shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the outer automorphism group of @xmath113 may then be generated by the reflection in the equatorial plane and a rotation exchanging the two poles ( this gives a splitting of the exact sequence of proposition [ abc ] slightly different to the one previously mentioned ) .",
    "it follows easily that @xmath167 is invariant by these mapping classes , and hence a characteristic subgroup of @xmath113 .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath178 .",
    "let @xmath179 . to prove that @xmath172 it suffices now to check that every mapping class which normalizes @xmath167 leaves @xmath142 invariant .",
    "but if @xmath180 then @xmath181 normalizes @xmath182 , and this is just to say that @xmath99 induces a symmetry of the puncture set which leaves @xmath142 invariant , as required .",
    "the remaining statements are now easily deduced from corollary [ normalizers ] and proposition [ abc ] .    in summary ,",
    "propositions [ abc ] and [ atilde ] give us explicitly the automorphism groups of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , for all @xmath0 , as well as the fact that the abstract commensurator group is in each case isomorphic to @xmath46 .",
    "this proves theorem [ main ] with the exception of the first isomorphism in each of part ( ii)(a ) and ( b ) . in the next section",
    "we shall recover the group @xmath183 from the above result on @xmath184 . in a similar fashion , the result of @xcite on automorphisms of the braid group is easily recovered from the computation of @xmath185 .",

    "the fact that @xmath190 is a homomorphism requires that @xmath188 is also a homomorphism , and it is easily checked that the composite of two transvections is again a transvection .",
