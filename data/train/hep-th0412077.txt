    "models of stringy inflation have matured considerably in the past year as mechanisms of moduli stabilization have been found and implemented , and aspects of specific warped compactifications have been studied .",
    "we currently have a novel situation in string theory : these scenarios not only provide an interesting arena to study moduli and geometry , but are guided by close connections with observation .",
    "in particular , the models should satisfy the slow - roll conditions and agree with the observed spectrum of density fluctuations .",
    "they must include the standard model and a mechanism for reheating . they may also give testable predictions for details of the cmb spectrum that are just beyond current observational reach and perhaps for phenomena such as cosmic strings .",
    "combining all of this in a single framework is a tall order , and there are many suggestions in the literature .",
    "we focus here on the first big hurdle : slow - roll .",
    "we will show how the physical picture is clarified by using a form of the potential that is invariant under khler transformations .",
    "we show that there is a very general argument for why we expect flat directions in the inflaton potential , and give details of two geometries : @xmath0 , where the geometric picture is simple , and the more realistic @xmath1 , where many details have already been worked out .",
    "we will also summarize the many contributions to the inflationary potential and give a few simple calculations using t - duality .    in the early days , work on brane inflation",
    "@xcite focused on achieving a flat enough potential between a non - bps brane pair to allow for about 60 e - folds of inflation .",
    "this work was done assuming all moduli were stabilized in a way that did not affect the inflationary dynamics . at first glance",
    ", it seemed slow - roll could not be achieved unless a brane and an antibrane were separated by a distance greater than the size of the compactification . however , when the fact that the branes were sitting in a compact space was accounted for , slow - roll was found either by tuning the brane - antibrane case or by using branes at angles @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in a complete string theory picture ,",
    "the inter - brane potential is easily made small by introducing warped throats in the compactification manifold , but other contributions to the inflationary potential complicate the question . in particular , recent proposals that solve the problem of moduli stabilization show contributions that appear to ruin the slow - roll .",
    "but as we will discuss , there are many other terms in the potential that must also be calculated and flat directions that can be found .",
    "the model that has emerged as a successful general framework for brane inflation is developed in three works , which we refer to as gkp@xcite ( giddings , kachru and polchinski ) , kklt @xcite ( kachru , kallosh , linde and trivedi ) and kklmmt @xcite ( kachru , kallosh , linde , maldacena , mcallister and trivedi ) . the set - up is iib string theory compactified on a calabi - yau 3-fold with one or more warped throats .",
    "moduli are stabilized by fluxes and non - perturbative effects and the warping of the throat aids inflation . including multiple warped throats allows more freedom in setting multiple scales .",
    "mobile d3 branes and d7 branes can be present in the bulk of the cy , and @xmath2 branes naturally sit at the ir tips of the throats .",
    "the @xmath2 branes lift the ads vacuum to a meta - stable ds minimum .",
    "it is clear by now that the positions of @xmath3-branes in a flux - stabilized n= 1 vacuum are fixed ( though there are flat directions in n= 2 vacua ) @xcite .",
    "this means the only candidate for the inflaton in brane inflation in the kklmmt like scenario is the position of a @xmath4-brane .",
    "if the @xmath4-brane annihilates with a @xmath5-brane towards the end of inflation , this is brane - antibrane inflation .",
    "if the @xmath4-brane collides with the @xmath3-branes towards the end of inflation , this is the @xmath6 inflationary scenario . since the attractive force in either scenario is , by itself , weak enough for slow roll , it is the other contributions to the inflaton mass that dictate the slow - roll condition . in this sense ,",
    "the slow - roll analysis for these two scenarios is essentially identical .",
    "if the @xmath4-brane position has an approximate shift symmetry ( flat direction ) at some particular locations in the cy manifold , then the relative forces ( @xmath6 versus @xmath7 ) will determine which scenario will take place .",
    "most effects we will discuss apply equally to both calculations .",
    "the kklmmt model at first glance appears to suffer from the @xmath8-problem .",
    "that is , it does not find a small enough slow - roll parameter = m_pl^2 where @xmath9 is the second derivative of the potential with respect to the inflaton .",
    "the other slow - roll parameter , @xmath10 , is defined by = ( ) ^2 where we want @xmath11 .",
    "since @xmath10 is typically the smaller of the two parameters , we shall focus on @xmath8 to determine the slow roll condition . to calculate @xmath8 the derivatives",
    "must be taken with respect to the canonical inflaton . to have enough inflation to solve the horizon , the defect , the flatness and the angular momentum problems , typically @xmath12 .",
    "but in kklmmt , the contribution from the khler potential alone gives @xmath13 .",
    "however , there are in general many contributions to the inflationary potential .",
    "to determine slow - roll , we need to know all the pieces that contribute more than 1% ( since @xmath14 ) . as a first pass at listing the contributions to the potential , we can write [ listterms ] v = v^f+v^d+v_sb where the last term includes effects which break supersymmetry . in general , there may be many contributions to each piece .",
    "the f - term , for example , contains the superpotential from fluxes ( @xmath15 ) and non - perturbative effects ( @xmath16 ) and the khler potential ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "supersymmetry breaking terms will include interactions between branes , antibranes and branes with fluxes .",
    "writing out the f - term and writing some explicit contributions to @xmath18 , we have v = e^k(g^a|bd_aw - 3|w|^2 ) + v^d + v_(|d ) + v _ ( ) +  where w = w_0+w_np @xmath19 comes from @xmath2 branes in the throat , and @xmath20 is the interbrane potential . the inclusion of the d - term may be motivated by considering flux on d7 branes @xcite or by trying to include the standard model @xcite .",
    "note that these are no - scale models ; that is , when the f - term is evaluated , we have v^f = e^k(g^a|bd_aw|d_bw - 3|w|^2)e^k(_i , jg^i|jd_iw|d_jw ) this cancellation means we will have to find some different mechanism ( i.e. , non - perturbative effects ) to fix the khler moduli .    in the f - term",
    ", @xmath15 can be fixed to a small constant in the kklmmt model . the non - perturbative superpotential",
    "( e.g. from gaugino condensation @xcite ) has the form [ wnp ] w_np = ae^-a where @xmath21 is the imaginary part of the khler modulus , @xmath22 .",
    "the original kklt paper made general arguments for why we expect this non - perturbative superpotential , but it is checked in detail in @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath19 lifts the minimum from ads to ds and comes from adding @xmath2 branes in the tip of the throat .",
    "it has the form v_(|d)= where @xmath23 is a postitive constant .",
    "taking as an example the case of d3-@xmath2 interaction , the term @xmath20 has the form ( ignoring warping for now ) [ ddbar ] v_()=2t_3(1- ) where @xmath24 is the separation of the branes and @xmath25 is a constant that depends on brane tension and the compactification volume . in the warped case , the distance to the tip of the throat is measured by the coordinate @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath2 is located at @xmath27 , close to the tip , and the @xmath4 is at @xmath28 .",
    "the warped coordinate is r^4 = r^4h(r ) where h(r ) = e^-4a the warped throat flattens the inter - brane potential , modifying eq.([ddbar ] ) : v_(d|d ) = 2t_3(1- ) where @xmath29 is the number of d3 branes .",
    "some mathematica code has been developed ( and is freely available ) based on the d3/d7 model .",
    "it is described in @xcite .",
    "the code is useful for following the dynamics of the scalar fields and computing cosmological consequences , but does not contain all the physics of eq.([listterms ] ) .    it may be possible to avoid the lengthy calculations suggested by eq.([listterms ] ) if there is a symmetry that provides a nearly flat direction for the inflaton .",
    "it was noted in appendix f of kklmmt that if the superpotential ( @xmath30 ) also had a dependence on the inflaton , it might cancel the khler contribution and allow slow roll .",
    "several arguments were made for why just such a dependence might be reasonable . in @xcite , it was shown that the superpotential preserves part of a shift symmetry of @xmath31 that is apparent by looking at the form of the physical volume .",
    "for the d3/d7 model , a similar argument was made in @xcite for the case of a mobile d7 , which is found in @xmath32 theories but not in @xmath33 .",
    "using the special geometry construction of @xmath1 @xcite with moduli for the postitions of d3 branes ( see  2 for details ) , @xcite showed that the superpotential and khler potential still allow for a shift of the d3 brane position for the n=1 case .",
    "furthermore , the authors of @xcite ( and a shorter version @xcite ) argue that the non - perturbative superpotential must include dependence on @xmath31 after one - loop contributions are included .",
    "in fact , we can immediately see with a khler transformation why @xmath30 can depend on @xmath31 .",
    "this argument holds to a first approximation in a model - independent way .",
    "the only case that has been worked out in detail , @xmath1 , clearly has flat directions , so these two statements together are good evidence that such symmetries may be generic .",
    "the ideas are similar in spirit to earlier work done in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , which considered the inflaton as a pseudo - goldstone boson .",
    "let us see how this works .",
    "consider the f - term potential [ fterm ] v^f = e^k(g^a|bd_aw - 3|w|^2 ) where d_aw = _ aw+w_ak and @xmath34 and @xmath35 label moduli .",
    "we will make use of the combination [ invar ] g = k + |w|^2 .",
    "this is invariant under khler transformations kk+f()+wwe^-f ( ) then eq.([fterm ] ) can be rewritten in terms of @xmath36 as v^f = e^gsince the f - term potential depends only on @xmath36 , dependence on @xmath31 can be shifted between the superpotential and khler potential .",
    "let us begin with the simplest form of the khler potential that is frequently assumed @xcite .",
    "our guide for how the inflaton @xmath31 should appear in @xmath17 is the kinetic term in the action : @xmath37_kinetic=-__i^|^j since this depends on the mixed derivative , it does not fix terms that depend only on @xmath31 or @xmath38 . from this , we find [ k1 ] k_1(,|,,| ) = -3 - 3 + 3 this form appears to treat the real and imaginary parts of @xmath31 equally .",
    "let us compare with the result in the special geometry construction on @xmath1 @xcite , where the form of @xmath17 depends only on the imaginary part of @xmath31 .",
    "this is a geometric result , not an approximation . in our notation , it is [ imonly ] k_2(,|,,| ) = -3 both @xmath39 and @xmath40 are equally valid from the perspective of kinetic terms .",
    "but since the real part of @xmath31 is not present in @xmath40 , it will not receive a large mass in the manner of kklmmt , and it appears we have a flat direction at this level . in a general brane inflationary scenario ,",
    "there are several possible directions @xmath41 so that @xmath8 is really a matrix _",
    "ij = m_pl^2 it is sufficient for slow roll if every @xmath42 .",
    "however , we actually require a weaker constraint .",
    "if one or more @xmath41 start to oscillate , their oscillations will be rapidly damped by inflation .",
    "so , in the diagonal basis , large positive eigenvalues of @xmath8 are totally harmless , provided they are stabilized , that is , the corresponding slow - roll parameter @xmath10 vanishes . for slow - roll inflation ,",
    "we require at least one eigenvalue of @xmath8 to be small .",
    "so we expect slow - roll if @xmath43 is protected .",
    "how can we explain the difference between eq.([k1 ] ) and eq.([imonly ] ) ?",
    "we will first determine a toy form of the superpotential for each case ( ignoring volume stabilization ) to motivate the form of the khler transfromation that connects @xmath39 and @xmath40 . throughout these calculations",
    ", we will assume @xmath22 is large ( since we want the supergravity description to be valid ) and that @xmath44 ( since we want non - imaginary kinetic terms ) .",
    "we also take @xmath45 since the separation between branes should be smaller than the compactification size . as in @xcite , we will enforce the supersymmetry conditions to determine a basic expression for the superpotential .",
    "this form may be modified when the khler modulus is stabilized , but it is all we need to see the relationship between the two possible khler potentials .",
    "we require d_w_(s)&=&_w_(s ) + w_(s)_k=0 + d_w_(s)&=&0 using the khler potential in eq.([k1 ] ) , with the inflaton outside the logarithm , and taking @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( since @xmath30 should be holomorhpic ) we find [ w1 ] w_1(s)=w_0 ^ 3/2e^~w_0 ^ 3/2(1- ) to first order , this agrees with the expression found in @xcite , but the two differ starting with the @xmath48 term . if we do the same using @xmath40 , we find that to all orders [ w2 ] w_2(s)=w_0 ^ 3/2 .",
    "to first order , we can relate the two khler potentials using a khler transformation . comparing eq.([w1 ] ) and eq.([w2 ] )",
    "suggests we choose : f()=- applying this gives [ ktrans ] w_1(s)&&w_0 ^ 3/2 + k_1(,|,,|)&&-3 + 3 - -+  now , since we expect @xmath49 to be small compared to @xmath50 we can write k_1(,|,,|)&&-3-+  + & & k_2    so we see that the pairs ( @xmath51 ) and ( @xmath52 ) are equivalent to first order",
    ". that is , the flat directions that are apparent from eq.([imonly ] ) are the same as the shift symmetries found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "using eq.([imonly ] ) has the advantage of making the shift symmetry transparent , and is well motivated by the calculation carried out in the @xmath1 case .",
    "however , at higher order we can not connect @xmath39 and @xmath40 by a khler transformation because terms that are not holomorphic or antiholomorphic in @xmath31 appear .",
    "also , the expansions of eq.([k1 ] ) and eq.([imonly ] ) have different coefficients for the @xmath53 term . since @xmath40 is derived from geometry ( and is consistent with finding @xmath17 from the lagrangian @xcite ) and since @xmath39 ( which is only a guess ) can be rewritten in the same form",
    ", this indicates that the shift symmetry is in fact generically present .",
    "the differences at higher order should be resolved if we could determine the exact khler potential for @xmath0 including brane position moduli .",
    "it is noted in @xcite that this is geometrically related @xmath1 without d7 branes .",
    "@xmath54 4 sugra for iib on @xmath0 is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "perhaps this leads to a geometrical determination of the khler potential that can be used similarly to eq.([imonly ] ) and would clear up the issues with higher order terms .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in  2 we discuss a few details of the two known models : @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we generalize previous discussions of shift symmetry to include more than one khler modulus and make use of t - duality to check the form of the khler potential . in ",
    "3 we comment on the relation between the analysis above and the many additional terms in the inflationary potential .",
    "we conclude in  4 .",
    "the @xmath1 model is the only realistic case that has been studied in much detail .",
    "a great deal of work has been done to investigate the supersymmetric vacua in the presence of 3-form fluxes @xcite , @xcite and to include d3 and d7 branes to connect to the d3-d7 inflationary scenario @xcite , @xcite . since these results contain all the pieces needed for a scenario that allows d3/d7 or d3/@xmath2 inflation , we will review them here . for continuity with this work ,",
    "we use the conventions of @xcite in this section .",
    "there are three moduli to consider in addition to the positions of the d3 and d7 branes : the khler modulus @xmath55 , the @xmath56 complex structure @xmath57 , and the axion - dilaton @xmath58 .",
    "these are defined as s & = & c_(4)-ivol(k3 ) + t & = & + i + u & = & c_(0 ) + ie^ where @xmath59 is the metric on @xmath56 .",
    "notice that @xmath60 to compare with the kklmmt notation .",
    "the position of the @xmath26th d3 brane along the torus @xmath56 is @xmath61 , and the position of the @xmath62th d7 brane is @xmath63 .",
    "the khler potential is @xcite [ k3kahler ] k & = & -this depends only on the imaginary part of the d3 brane position as discussed above .",

    "the @xmath68 are couplings related to the fluxes that break supersymmetry , so choosing various combinations of @xmath68 non - zero corresponds to different amounts of supersymmetry . in the @xmath69 2 case",
    ", @xmath70 and any dependence on @xmath61 comes only through the factor @xmath71 . in that case , both the d7 and d3 positions are moduli . for @xmath69 1 ,",
    "the postitions of the d7 branes are fixed .",
    "this can also be seen from the earlier results of gkp : since the d7 s are wrapping some 4-cycles , then if the complex structure moduli are fixed the position of the d7s are fixed .",
    "specializing to the @xmath54 1 case ( @xmath72 ) simplifies the expressions above .",
    "in particular , the scalar potential becomes : [ scalarpot2 ] v = 4e^2e^knote that eq.([scalarpot2 ] ) does not depend on the position of the d3 brane except through the khler potential .",
    "when the full potential depends on the inflaton only through the exponential factor @xmath71 , with @xmath17 given as in eq.([k3kahler ] ) , the contribution of the f - term to @xmath8 is always small ( assuming @xmath73 ) .",
    "for the special case of @xmath74 , eq.([scalarpot2 ] ) is identically zero .",
    "we can then use eq.([scalarpot2 ] ) and eq.([k3kahler ] ) to calculate the superpotential for this case .",
    "we find that the superpotential is constant , and so does not depend on the brane position .",
    "so for the case of @xmath33 , regardless of the values of the other moduli , the contribution of the f - term to @xmath8 does not destroy the slow - roll .",
    "some additional analysis of the d3-d7 model can be found in @xcite .",

    "a simpler model to analyze is a compactification on @xmath0 .",
    "we have explained in the introduction how shift symmetry can be seen in this case . here , we will also see that in this model t - duality is a good guide to the form of the khler potential , particularly in the @xmath542 case where mobile d7 branes may be present .",

    "the d3-brane can move around this stack of d7s either radially or azimuthally as it moves toward the @xmath2 in the throat .",
    "if we consider open strings stretched between the d3 and the stack of d7s , their mass must be proportional to the radial distance between the branes .",
    "as long as the d3 moves along the azimuthal direction with a fixed radial distance from the d7s , the strong interaction between them will remain unchanged and that is what we interpret as the flat direction of @xmath126 .",
    "we can also see from this picture that the locations of the d3 , @xmath2 and d7 branes will decide which interaction drives inflation .",
    "for example , it is likely the d3 and @xmath2 will not be aligned exactly along a flat direction , as in figure [ d3motion](b ) .",
    "then the d3-d7 interaction may be the source of the slow - roll . in a realistic case",
    ", we may expect to have several throats and several stacks of d7 s , so there may be many competing effects . just the competition between two throats can lead to an enhanced possibility for slow - roll @xcite .",
    "one final comment is in order regarding shift symmetry for inflation in the @xmath32 case . consider a t - duality along tori t@xmath114 and t@xmath115 .",
    "as mentioned before @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the discussion of shift symmetry for @xmath129 is now mapped to @xmath130 , and it is now the @xmath105 stabilization which should be scrutinized .",
    "in fact , the situation seems more severe than before , because @xmath105 is stabilized at the perturbative level . in gkp",
    "it was shown that the perturbative superpotential has a linear dependence on @xmath105 , which will in general give @xmath131 .    to see this more explicitly ,",

    "this demonstrates that @xmath105 stabilization would spoil the shift symmetry of @xmath142 even at the perturbative level .",
    "in this section we return to eq.([listterms ] ) and the many contributions to the inflationary potential .",
    "the presence of a shift symmetry guarantees that the f - term will not ruin slow - roll , but we still must check the other terms . also , in a model without shift symmetry , slow - roll may still take place if any large contributions are cancelled by other terms . at the end of this section",
    "we will review progress toward constructing complete models and possible observational consequences .      among the considerations for calculating the slow - roll potential are @xmath143 corrections .",
    "in general , it is important to ensure that any corrections to the superpotential be consistent with eq.([invar ] ) and any known corrections to the khler potential . in other words",
    ", one should check that all results are invariant under khler transformations .",
    "leading order @xmath143 corrections to the superpotential are calculated in @xcite for the @xmath144 model and generalized to @xmath145 ( without moduli stabilization ) .",
    "a naive dimensional argument suggests a typical dimensionless parameter involving @xmath143 is @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the size of the compactification manifold , which is typically a small number .",
    "so one might assume such corrections may be ignored .",
    "however , in specific kklt like scenarios , there are additional scales generated in the vacuum , so one should check the size of the @xmath143 corrections .    in @xcite , the correction to the gauge coupling",
    "was calculated by the background field method . in the presence of background gauge field strength",
    "@xmath65 with gauge field @xmath148 and wilson lines @xmath149 , the one - loop contribution ( from the torus , the klein bottle , the mobious strip and the cylinder ) takes the form : _",

    "after t - dualizing the 6 compact dimensions , they obtain the 3- and 7-brane picture , where the @xmath148 of a d9-brane becomes the position @xmath41 of a 3-brane , which is identified as the inflaton . the result for the corrected gauge kinetic function on the d7 brane is ^7=-i-+ ",

    ".    as we have seen , the inflaton potential ( and so @xmath8 ) depends on the particular combination @xmath36 of the khler potential @xmath17 and the superpotential @xmath30 .",
    "the calculation in @xcite so far includes only the 1-loop contribution to @xmath30 .",
    "since a khler transformation can move any contribution from @xmath17 to @xmath30 or vice versa , it will be important to find the 1-loop contribution to @xmath17 and check to see if the contribution to @xmath36 or @xmath8 is indeed large .",
    "also , the calculation was carried out in simplified versions of the realistic model .",
    "it is not entirely clear how valid extrapolation is to a kklmmt model .",
    "khler corrections can usually be ignored for large volumes ( and kklt easily obtains a large volume , which is also needed for the supergravity description to hold ) , but @xcite argues that the no - scale structure of the kklt models makes the corrections significant for the qualitative form of the potential .",
    "their concern is with a possible solution to the cosmological constant problem , and does not directly impact the @xmath8 question , but in general such corrections may be important .",
    "the form of perturbative corrections to the khler potential is worked out in @xcite .",
    "the leading order is an @xmath158 term that depends on the dilaton and appears in the part of the khler potential that contains the khler modulus .",
    "since the d3-brane moduli appear together with @xmath22 , this changes the kinetic term for @xmath31 and so changes the rescaling that must be done to obtain the canonically normalized field .",
    "the form of non - perturbative corrections to the khler potential are discussed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "investigations of how d - terms may be useful in inflation predate the brane inflation scenario @xcite , @xcite , and continue to be discussed outside that framework @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we will review this work as it nicely illustrates the difference between d- and f - terms and since investigations along these lines may uncover ideas useful in brane inflation .",
    "the original idea of including d - terms was to solve the @xmath8 problem which arises from f - terms only .",
    "the issue is that all scalars receive a mass of order @xmath159 , which ruins slow - roll .",
    "but if the d - term dominates and the inflaton is not charged under the gauge group involved , @xmath31 gets a mass only through loop effects .",
    "this can be small enough to keep @xmath160 .",
    "this scenario goes by the name `` d - term inflation '' . despite the promise of small @xmath8 ,",
    "these models suffer from a runaway dilaton and are in numerical conflict with cmb measurements ( the magnitude of the fi term is too large ) @xcite .",
    "they also predict cosmic strings that would contribute too much to density perturbations .",
    "much work has also been done to discuss d - terms in the brane inflation scenario .",
    "we will first outline some considerations that do not directly deal with the @xmath8 question , but arise any time d - terms are present . in @xcite",
    ", it was found that adding d - terms to the potential gave rise to ds vacua .",
    "although several mechanisms have been used to achieve de sitter space , starting with kklmmt who included @xmath2 branes in the throat ( and @xcite which demonstrated that @xmath161 are not necessary ) , the advantage of adding d - terms is that the action is fully supersymmetric .",
    "the d3-d7 brane inflation model @xcite takes advantage of the benefits of d - term inflation to get slow - roll .",
    "this scenario has been well - established in the kklmmt context by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found that when the standard model is included in the warped throat of a kklt model , d - terms are naturally introduced .",
    "the idea is to include the standard model on a d3 ( or anti - d3 ) brane localized at a fixed point at the tip of the throat .",
    "the blowing - up modes associated with the singularities combine with the axions needed for anomaly cancellation to give new complex moduli .",
    "these contribute to the 4d potential as a d - term .",
    "the resulting model has the many desired features : inflation , reheating , and the standard model .",
    "numerical work is included in @xcite illustrating several possible trajectories for the inflaton . from this",
    ", it appears that it is much easier to get less than 60 e - folds of inflation in string theory , leading the authors to suggest some modifications of the usual inflation scenario ( such as two periods of inflation ) .",
    "other work relating d - term inflation to brane inflation includes @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the final class of terms , interbrane interactions , received the most attention prior to kklt .",
    "the inter - brane potential was the focus of most earlier brane inflation work , when it was simply assumed that some mechanism fixed the moduli .",
    "it was found that in general brane / anti - brane scenarios have a potential that is too steep to give slow roll . however , there are at least three known solutions to this problem , all of which can be used in the kklmmt context .",
    "the first has already been discussed : inflation between branes in a warped throat works because the warp factor can flatten the potential ( see eq.([ddbar ] ) ) .",
    "the second is used in d3/d7 inflation , which takes advantage of the d - term scenario discussed in the previous section .",
    "the third possibility is to use branes at angles @xcite , @xcite .",
    "branes intersecting at multiple angles may provide a way to more naturally include realistic particle content ( chiral fermions ) @xcite .",
    "then the inter - brane potential depends on the angle roughly as @xmath162 in the constant @xmath25 in eq.([ddbar ] )",
    ". the potential may then be quite flat for small angles . since t - duality relates the d3/d7 model to inflation between two sets of d5-branes at angles , this possibility",
    "may also be incorporated in the current discussion .",
    "along with the d3/d7 model , this shares the advantage of not needing the warping , which simplifies calculations .",
    "other work on @xmath125 inflation includes @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "typically , we require the brane interaction term to give slow roll and then focus on the other effects that may ruin inflation .",
    "however , a recent proposal @xcite takes advantage of coulombic interactions to balance other contributions .",
    "the picture there is a compactification with symmetric throats containing anti - d3 branes . for a d3 placed near the symmetry point ,",
    "the inter - brane interactions cancel the contribution from the superpotential and the system then satisfies slow - roll .",
    "the models discussed in  2 are not quite complete since they do not address the issue of stabilization of kahler moduli . in @xcite , a series of examples",
    "is found that completely realizes the procedure outlined in kklt .",
    "that is , the dilaton and complex structure are fixed with fluxes , meta - stable ds minima are available , and non - perturbative effects stabilize all the kahler moduli .",
    "mathematical requirements limit the models that can do all this , but among those that work are fano threefolds .",
    "these have the additional advantage that they have been well studied and classified @xcite .",
    "the main result for these models is that the procedure for fixing all moduli works in many cases but not generically .",
    "the models are constructed such that @xmath163 corrections can be ignored .",
    "there is a claim that mathematically any usable model must have more than one kahler moduli , which is already a complication from the examples cited above , although @xcite argues that this restriction is not necessary .    after checking that a particular model gives enough inflation and a reasonable spectrum of density perturbations",
    ", one can look for signatures that may distinguish string theory models .",
    "details and consequences of d3/d7 inflation are considered in @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the results from a kklt scenario , including a possible explanation of dark energy , is found in @xcite .",
    "cosmic strings as a consequence of brane inflation are developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "work on cosmic strings as d- and f - strings includes @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . the possibility that the cosmic strings formed may be semilocal",
    "is discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have seen that in practice the question of slow - roll in stringy inflation models can become mired in detailed calculations , especially in realistic compactifications . in spite of this",
    ", we would like to know if slow - roll can be expected as a general feature .",
    "the simplest approach seems to be to look for shift symmetries : flat directions that preserve slow - roll regardless of the results of the more difficult calculations .",
    "our main conclusion is that the evidence so far ( from @xmath164 and @xmath6 models ) , indicates that shift symmetry , at least to first order , is generic and so we expect slow - roll to be possible .    from our sample calculations , we also see that t - duality is a useful check on the form of the khler potential",
    ". it may be interesting to use t - duality in a more complete model to find , for example , the dual description of the d3/d7 model as d5 branes at angles .",
    "we can also imagine extending this idea to see what can be found from checking mirror - symmetric descriptions . at the very least",
    ", we will learn something about moduli stabilization since we would exchange moduli that are currently stabilized by very different ( perturbative vs. non - perturbative ) methods .",
    "finally , we note that there are recent ideas for achieving inflation that do not rely on the types of calculations discussed here .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite make use of the higher order kinetic terms in the dbi action and a `` speed limit '' on the moduli space to find enough inflation without the need for a flat potential .",
