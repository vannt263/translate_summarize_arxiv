    "a recently published database provides microarray expression data for affymetrix u95a chip , containing 12,600 probes , and hybridized to 101 different samples @xcite from 47 different human tissues and cell lines .",
    "these samples are mainly from the normal human physiological state , and therefore this dataset provides a description of the normal mammalian transcriptome .",
    "we calculated the distribution of the number of different tissues in which a gene is expressed .",
    "discarding probes for which the associated gene was not represented in the refseq database @xcite , and unifying all probes measuring the same gene ( ignoring the potential differences among splice variants ) yielded probes representing 7500 human genes .",
    "the experiments measuring replicates of the same biological condition were averaged to reduce the measurement noise , resulting in 47 data points per probe .",
    "we considered that a probe was expressed in a certain condition if its average reading was above a certain cutoff value .",
    "the results were not sensitive to the exact cut - off value , and we chose 200 standard affymetrix averagedifference units , considered to be a conservative cut - off value for determining gene presence @xcite .",
    "this is also the trimmed average expression level in each tissue in accordance with the standard affymetrix normalization procedure @xcite .",
    "thus , our hk genes are expressed in all tissues at an above - average level .    a histogram ( fig .",
    "1 ) of the number of genes expressed in exactly m of the 47 tissues shows a clear tendency for frequency to decrease as m increases .",
    "however , a substantial number of genes ( 575 ) , belong to the class of genes that are expressed in all tissues .",
    "because their number is far greater than expected based on the general trend described above , we assumed this class to be rich in hk genes , and considered it to be the set of hk genes .",
    "it is noteworthy that the genes in our hk list tend to have an average expression significantly higher than other genes ; the geometric mean expression of our hk genes is 1200 in affymetrix average difference units , whereas that of other genes is 150 .",
    "the difference can not be accounted for by the cutoff used to define the hk genes , and is not a result of a bias due to inclusion of genes expressed in a few tissues only ( data not shown ) .",
    "two additional tests were conducted to validate this set .",
    "first , a study of the go annotation @xcite of these genes revealed the set is rich in metabolic proteins ( 24% ) and rna - interacting proteins ( 19% , mostly ribosomal proteins ) .",
    "second , we compiled a list of 18 well - established hk genes commonly used for quantitative pcr calibration @xcite , and checked our list against it .",
    "we found 13 of the 18 genes in our list , and the other five were not represented on the microarray ( see table in supplementary information at http://www.compugen.co.il/supp_info/housekeeping_genes.html ) .",
    ".*human housekeeping genes are compact . * comparison of structure of housekeeping ( hk ) genes versus non - hk genes . for each case",
    "the first line gives the average value , s.e.m , and the second line gives the median .",
    "for the average intron and exon lengths , all introns and exons belonging to the relevant set were included ; the number appears in parentheses .",
    "the p - value was calculated using the mann - whitney test .",
    "utr , untranslated region .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     table 1 compares the lengths of various parts of the hk genes and the background genes .",
    "the alignment data was taken from the ucsc genome browser ( http://genome.ucsc.edu ) @xcite .",
    "we excluded 322 genes that do not have a unique alignment , as well as 1242 genes that were not expressed in any tissue ( to avoid potential problems because of defective probes ) .",
    "this left 532 hk genes and 5404 non - hk genes .",
    "the histograms in fig .",
    "2 - 4 compare hk genes with the other genes by total intron length , 5 utr length and coding sequence length .",
    "remarkably , there was a statistically significant difference between hk and non - hk genes in all aspects of gene structure .",
    "average intron length is shorter for the hk genes than for the background genes ( 2573 bp versus 5025 bp , respectively ) ; total gene length is shorter ( 21,050 bp versus 53,418 bp ) ; average exon length is shorter ( 212 bp versus 240 bp ) ; average lengths of both 3 and 5 untranslated regions ( utrs ) are shorter ( 5 : 135 bp versus 173 bp ; 3 : 599 bp versus 846 bp ) ; and , most notably , the translated proteins are shorter as well ( 403 amino acids versus 590 amino acids ) . accordingly , the number of introns bp per unit of coding sequence length is lower for the hk genes ( 20 versus 32 ) .",
    "we studied the structure of each gene as a function of the number of tissues it is expressed in and verified that the results are not due to bias of the non - hk genes by tissue - specific genes ( data not shown ) .",
    "the pronounced statistical characteristics of the hk gene set further supports their assignment as a unique set .",
    "our findings confirm and extend previous research , showing that the introns of highly expressed genes are shorter @xcite . as mentioned above , the hk genes expression levels are high , and the fact that they have to be expressed in all cells at all times makes them even more costly to transcribe .",
    "previously @xcite , the high abundance of a certain gene in est libraries was an indication the gene was highly expressed in the human body .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite , however , that this method is prone to bias due to the inclusion of normalized and tumor libraries and overrepresentation of certain tissues .",
    "our approach overcomes this difficulty and confirms the previous result .",
    "moreover , we find here that utrs and even the encoded proteins are shorter for the hk genes .",
    "the magnitude of the difference is greater for the introns than for the exons and proteins ( table 1 ) , which makes sense because the coding sequences and the utrs are less susceptible to change .",
    "it should be mentioned that intronless genes were included in our analysis after verifying that their inclusion or exclusion had no effect on the results .",
    "it also must be noted that the utrs are not always fully sequenced , and thus their actual lengths might be longer .",
    "this bias was found to have no effect on the length of the coding sequences , and in any case the effect would be the same for both hk and non - hk genes .",
    "it has been noted that codon usage bias in nonmammalian organisms is correlated with the expression level and with the gene length @xcite .",
    "these results led to the conjecture of selective pressure on highly expressed genes resulting in shorter proteins @xcite .",
    "however , no evidence for this selection was found @xcite , possibly because of a lack of high quality databases for these organisms .",
    "recent works have suggested that there is no selection for codon usage bias in humans @xcite , and thus our results demonstrate that the expression - length correlation is not related to the expression - codon bias correlation .        it could be argued that selection towards shorter genes should have eliminated the introns in highly expressed genes .",
    "however , it is known that introns do have important roles , such as splicing regulation .",
    "therefore , there is a balance between the advantageous contribution of the introns and the selective pressure for shortening",
    ".    finally , when we compared our results with two ( largely overlapping ) published sets of hk genes , we found that roughly half of the genes in the intersection of those sets were present in our set .",
    "we used the genomic structure to test the remaining genes , and found a statistically significant difference between them and our hk gene set .",
    "the differences between our results and those of earlier studies @xcite could be due to the fact that the database we used was based on more advanced chip technology and included many more different tissues , giving it more discriminative power to identify hk genes .",
    "in conclusion , we have identified a set of hk genes .",
    "the set is publicly available at http://www.compugen.co.il/supp_info/housekeeping_genes.html and can be used for calibration of microarrays , toxicity evaluation and quantitative pcr experiments .",
    "furthermore , we show that hk genes have shorter introns , utrs and coding sequences , attesting to the strong selection for compactness in these genes .",
