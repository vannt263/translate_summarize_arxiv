    "first - passage percolation ( fpp ) was introduced by hammersley and welsh @xcite as a model for fluid flow through a porous medium .",
    "however , it has since developed into a field of its own , serving for instance as a model for growing interfaces ( see @xcite and connections to other models @xcite ) and competing infections ( see @xcite ) . for a survey of recent results , see @xcite .",
    "we consider fpp on @xmath1 the two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "@xmath2 will denote a probability measure on the space @xmath3 ( satisfying some conditions outlined in the next section ) .",
    "an element @xmath4 represents an edge - weight configuration ; the passage time across the edge @xmath5 is denoted @xmath6 .",
    "the passage time between two sites @xmath7 will be called @xmath8 where the infimum is over all ( finite ) lattice paths from @xmath9 to @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "in this paper we study geodesics , ( typically self - avoiding ) paths in @xmath0 which are everywhere time - minimizing .",
    "precisely , define a finite geodesic from @xmath9 to @xmath10 to be a finite lattice path @xmath12 from @xmath9 to @xmath10 such that @xmath13 .",
    "define an infinite geodesic to be an infinite path such that each finite subpath is a finite geodesic . in the mid 90 s ,",
    "newman @xcite and licea - newman @xcite , along with wehr @xcite began the rigorous study of infinite geodesics .",
    "this was in part motivated by connections between `` bigeodesics '' in fpp and ground states of disordered ferromagnetic spin models @xcite .",
    "the main questions involve existence of infinite geodesics with asymptotic directions , uniqueness and coalescence of such geodesics , and absence of bigeodesics .",
    "after considerable progress on lattice fpp , howard and newman gave an essentially complete description for a continuum variant , called euclidean fpp @xcite .",
    "the main theorems proved to date require heavy assumptions on the model , for instance strong moment bounds and so - called curvature inequalities ( the establishment of which provides a major open problem in fpp ) .",
    "the main goals of this paper are to prove versions of the current geodesic theorems under minimal assumptions necessary to guarantee their validity .",
    "because the methods of newman and collaborators involve curvature bounds and concentration inequalities ( the latter of which can not hold under low moment assumptions ) , we are forced to develop completely new techniques .",
    "our analysis centers on busemann functions , which were used and analyzed in papers of hoffman @xcite .",
    "his work was one of the first ( along with garet - marchand @xcite ) to assert existence of multiple disjoint infinite geodesics under general assumptions , finding at least four almost surely .",
    "the methods are notable in their ability to extract any information without knowing the existence of limits for busemann functions .",
    "indeed , proving the existence of such limits , corresponding to @xmath14\\ ] ] for fixed @xmath7 and a deterministic sequence of vertices @xmath15 growing to infinity along a ray , provides a major open problem and appears to be an impediment to further analysis of geodesics in the model .",
    "incidentally , in an effort to describe the microstructure of the limiting shape for the model , newman @xcite was able to show that under strong assumptions , this limit exists in lebesgue - almost every direction .    one main aim of the present paper is to develop a framework to overcome the existence of the above limit .",
    "we will analyze distributional limits of busemann functions and relate these back to the first - passage model . the relationship between busemann functions and geodesics",
    "will be preserved in the limit and will provide information about directional geodesics , coalescence , and the structure of geodesic graphs , the latter of which gives nonexistence of certain types of bigeodesics .",
    "we will make one of two main assumptions on the passage time distribution .",
