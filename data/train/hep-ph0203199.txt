    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt)@xcite is a low momentum effective field theory for qcd written as an expansion in small momenta and quark masses , and it has become an invaluable tool for subatomic physics . with only the lightest octets of pseudoscalar mesons and spin-1/2 baryons , chpt is order - by - order renormalizable and physical results are independent of whichever regularization prescription is chosen .",
    "the addition of the lightest decuplet of spin-3/2 baryons introduces a new physical scale , the mass difference between decuplet and octet baryons , which does not vanish in the chiral limit ( i.e. when quark masses vanish ) .",
    "however , this mass difference is similar in size to the pseudoscalar meson masses , so the strict chiral expansion can be generalized to a `` small scale expansion '' where power counting is now meaningful even if the decuplet baryons are present.@xcite    although physical results are independent of regularization scheme , sometimes one scheme is preferable over another such as when issues other than experimentally - observable quantities are of interest .",
    "for example , the convergence of the chpt expression for an observable is often evaluated by comparing the relative sizes of the contributions that occur at successive orders in the expansion , even though these individual contributions are not physically observable . the work of refs .",
    "@xcite discusses this in some detail , and goes one step further by associating the renormalization scale with the physical scale of baryon substructure .",
    "for another example of important non - observables , consider lattice qcd .",
    "numerical simulations must be performed at nonzero lattice spacing , and computed results therefore differ from the desired continuum values .",
    "one might expect that the effective theory for a discretization of qcd is a discretization of chpt , i.e. the most general effective theory , written in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom , that respects chiral symmetry and the other symmetries of discretized qcd and that exists in the same discretized spacetime . our previous work , ref .",
    "@xcite , provides one particular discretization of chpt along with explicit calculations of differences between results in this theory and results in the continuum .",
    "the present work is mainly intended to exemplify the technique of lattice regularization ( with explicit decuplet fields ) , and to note some of its features . within a chosen lattice chpt",
    ", it is a simple matter to rigorously determine extrapolations in both quark mass and lattice spacing .",
    "although less familiar than dimensional regularization , lattice regularization has the advantage that loops integrals can easily be performed numerically , since it is a 4-dimensional theory .",
    "the size of lattice spacing artifacts depends on the particular observable that is studied ; at lattice spacings typical of lattice qcd simulations , we find that our lattice chpt lagrangian leads to noticeable discretization effects for the magnetic moments of octet baryons but negligible discretization effects for the sigma terms .",
    "it is important to interpret our numerical results appropriately .",
    "if one is interested in using a lattice chiral lagrangian to rigorously determine the lattice spacing effects that are present in a specific lattice qcd simulation , then it will be important to use the chiral lagrangian that properly corresponds to whatever lattice qcd action was employed .",
    "rupak and shoresh@xcite provide a list of five @xmath2 terms that can appear in the meson chiral lagrangian appropriate for a wilson - type lattice qcd action .",
    "( @xmath3 denotes the lattice spacing . )",
    "each of these terms is multiplied by its own parameter which depends on the particular lattice qcd action of interest .",
    "for example , all five of the coefficients can be made to vanish by using an `` improved '' lattice qcd action .",
    "a similar study could be performed for the baryon lagrangian .",
    "our present work does not refer to any specific lattice qcd data , and this leaves the parameters at @xmath2 and beyond undetermined .",
    "these parameters get specified implicitly by our choice of a minimal lagrangian where the only lattice spacing effects are contained within simple covariant derivatives and field representations .",
    "the numerical results for magnetic moments and sigma terms presented in this work are therefore simply examples of lattice spacing effects that arise from a lagrangian which has not been specially improved in any way .",
    "the main point of our present work is to demonstrate the use of lattice regularization for chiral lagrangian calculations , but we wish to emphasize that this regularization technique can certainly be applied to extensions of our minimal lagrangian if one wishes to fix the lattice spacing parameters to a particular lattice qcd action .    in sec .",

    "<S> ( march 20 2002 )    an su(3 ) chiral lagrangian for the lightest decuplet of baryons is constructed on a discrete lattice of spacetime points , and is added to an existing lattice lagrangian for the lightest octets of mesons and baryons . </S>",
    "<S> a nonzero lattice spacing renders all loop integrations finite , and the continuum limit of any physical observable is identical to the result obtained from dimensional regularization . </S>",
    "<S> chiral symmetry and gauge invariance are preserved even at nonzero lattice spacing . </S>",
    "<S> specific calculations discussed here include the non - renormalization of a conserved vector current , the magnetic moments of octet baryons , and the @xmath0 and @xmath1 sigma terms that relate to the nucleon s strangeness content . the quantitative difference between physics at a nonzero lattice spacing and physics in the continuum limit </S>",
    "<S> is easily computed , and it represents an expectation for the size of discretization errors in corresponding lattice qcd simulations . </S>"
