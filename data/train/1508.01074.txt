    "as in the proof of theorem [ thm : small balls ] we take @xmath384 to be beurling - selberg polynomials which majorize and minorize the indicator function of the ball @xmath55 with @xmath385 . we take the lengths of the polynomials @xmath384 to be @xmath386 with @xmath186 .",
    "given an orthonormal basis @xmath387 of the @xmath73-eigenspace define @xmath388    using lemma  [ lem : localbd ] along with the bound @xmath389 given by lemma [ lem : bsfns ] ( iv ) ( which holds uniformly in @xmath191 ) , we get from chebyshev s inequality as in the proof of theorem  [ thm : small balls ] that @xmath390 since we assume @xmath75 and @xmath391 or @xmath3 and @xmath73 odd , combining lemma [ lem : abd ] and gives @xmath392 thus , @xmath393 where in the last step we bounded the inner sum as @xmath394 since if @xmath395 then the sum is empty .",

    "repeating the same argument given at the end of the proof of theorem [ thm : small balls ] ( see equations , ) we see that each eigenfunction in this subset satisfies @xmath400    [ rem : caps ] our argument reduces the problem of small scale quantum ergodicity to a lattice point estimate , which can be rephrased in terms of statistics of lattice points in caps : for each lattice point @xmath401 , let @xmath402 be the number of _ other _ lattice points in a cap of size @xmath267 about @xmath359 .",
    "in fact we actually show that in any dimension @xmath254 if @xmath403 then the assertion of theorem [ thm:3dloc ] holds in dimension @xmath33 at scales @xmath404 ( we also assume here that @xmath405 if @xmath75 and @xmath73 is odd if @xmath3 , for @xmath340 no such restrictions are needed ) .",
    "that is , given the above , small scale quantum ergodicity holds in dimension @xmath33 at scales above @xmath404 on every such @xmath73-eigenspace .",

    "on the other hand , for @xmath50 we are able to rule out this behavior for balls with radii that shrink sufficiently slowly .",
    "note that the result is trivial for @xmath412 , because then for @xmath297 we can replace @xmath413 and then the average of @xmath414 over the ball @xmath89 will be large .",

    "the construction of massive irregularities in the previous section used some features particular to high dimensions .",
    "in fact for @xmath50 , we can rule out the existence of this behavior at scales that are not too small , and expect that massive irregularities do not exist at all scales that are at least slightly above the planck scale . more precisely , if @xmath50 then for every eigenfunction @xmath406 we will prove that the proportion of @xmath0 mass inside balls with radii @xmath469 is bounded and we expect this should be true as long as @xmath470 .",
