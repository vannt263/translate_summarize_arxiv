    "[ sec : intro ]    planets and comets are assembled from the gas , dust and ices in circumstellar disks that in turn evolve from the envelopes and clouds surrounding ysos .",
    "many key questions about the molecular composition of protostellar environments are still unanswered .",
    "the infrared spectra of ysos are rich in absorption features caused by the vibrational transitions of silicates and of solid h@xmath1o , co , @xmath5co , ch@xmath3oh , nh@xmath3 , ocs , ch@xmath6 , co@xmath1 , @xmath5co@xmath1 , and possibly of ocn@xmath7 , nh@xmath4 , hcooh and hcoo@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "band profile studies revealed that both co and co@xmath1 are present in multiple components of mixed or pure ices that are formed or destroyed at different stages of the cloud and envelope evolution @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that the prominent 6.0 and 6.85 @xmath0  absorption features toward low and high mass ysos are caused by the overlapping modes of simple species : h@xmath1o , h@xmath1co , hcooh , nh@xmath3 , nh@xmath4 , and ch@xmath3oh @xcite .",
    "not all absorption observed in this wavelength region is explained , however , such as the very broad component labeled `` c5 '' in @xcite .",
    "ices processed by heat , uv photons or cosmic ray hits are potential candidates",
    ". both ions @xcite and hydrocarbons @xcite have absorption features that are spread over much of the 5 - 8  @xmath0  region .",
    "pah molecules embedded in the ices could be responsible for some of the absorption as well .",
    "these molecules are formed by a complex interplay between numerous formation and destruction processes .",
    "grain surface chemistry likely dominates the formation of molecules ( e.g. , h@xmath1o , ch@xmath6 , co@xmath1 ) in cold , dense molecular clouds , leading to icy mantles ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the protostellar environment",
    "these ices may sublimate through the influence of shocks or photons in the inner envelopes and disk surfaces .",
    "the formation of complex molecules in the ices may be triggered by heating and by the absorption of energetic photons @xcite originating in the protostar - disk boundary layer . in the most shielded areas ( outer envelopes , disk mid - planes ) deeply penetrating cosmic rays can induce similar effects .",
    "it is still quite uncertain which molecule formation and destruction processes are important in these different environments .",
    "what is the composition of ices in pristine clouds , prior to star formation ?",
    "to what degree does the solar system molecular inventory resemble quiescent cloud inventories ?    a rigorous observational approach is required to further constrain the origin of unidentified absorption bands , especially in the 5 - 8  @xmath0  region , and to disentangle the many effects of the physical environment on molecular evolution .",
    "an established technique is to contrast the molecular composition toward ysos with that toward background stars tracing quiescent molecular cloud material ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "large abundances of the most volatile species ( e.g. , pure , `` apolar '' co ice ) are observed in quiescent lines of sight , which is attributed to the absence of nearby heating sources .",
    "likewise , amorphous ice structures are observed in these sight - lines , whereas toward ysos they are sometimes crystalline @xcite .",
    "tight upper limits have been set to the abundance of the species ocn@xmath7 ( cyanate ; @xcite ) and ch@xmath3oh @xcite toward background stars , suggesting that specific physical conditions found only around ysos may be needed to initiate their formation .",
    "so far , mid - infrared ( @xmath8 @xmath0 ) studies have focused on only a few background stars : four toward the taurus molecular cloud , one toward serpens , and one toward ic  5146 .",
    "@xcite show that the absorption bands in the 5 - 8  @xmath0  wavelength region are similar to those toward ysos .",
    "the 15  @xmath0  co@xmath1 band shows a non - polar ice component consistent with the pristine nature of the taurus cloud @xcite , a conclusion that can be drawn for serpens and ic 5146 as well @xcite .",
    "the studied samples are too small to fully assess the ice inventory prior to star formation , given the wide range of environmental conditions possible .",
    "much larger samples of background stars are needed , covering wider ranges of extinctions and cloud types .",
    "selecting these samples is now possible using the catalogs produced by wide field _",
    "irac and mips mapping projects , in combination with the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) . in this work ,",
    "background stars are selected from the catalogs of nearby ( @xmath9350 pc ) , isolated , compact ( @xmath10 arcmin ) , dense ( @xmath11 ) cores of the _ spitzer _ legacy team `` from molecular cores to planet forming disks '' ( c2d ; @xcite ) .",
    "these cores were originally identified in optically selected regions of extinction by observing transitions of nh@xmath3 sensitive to high densities ( @xmath12 ; @xcite ) . based on iras colors",
    ", a subdivision was made between starless cores and cores containing stars , and it was concluded that roughly half the cores contain stars @xcite . with the sensitive _ spitzer _ mips and irac cameras , deep searches revealed new ysos , down to stellar masses of 0.01 @xmath13 , even in some cores that were previously categorized as `` starless '' @xcite .",
    "studying the interstellar medium in isolated cores is attractive , because it lacks the environmental influences of outflows and the resulting turbulence often thought to dominate in regions of clustered star formation ( e.g. , @xmath14 oph , serpens ) .",
    "their star formation time scales can be significantly larger due to the dominance of magnetic fields over turbulence and the resulting slow process of ambipolar diffusion @xcite .",
    "the longer time scales may alter the gas composition , such as reduced c / co and h / h@xmath1 ratios , which would qualitatively alter the grain surface chemistry .",
    "furthermore , the longer exposure time of the ices to cosmic rays or cosmic ray induced ultraviolet photons may initiate reactions with large energy barriers leading to the formation of complex species @xcite .    while ices in the quiescent medium toward isolated dense cores have rarely been studied , the 9.7  @xmath0  band of silicates received more attention . @xcite",
    "found that toward the ic 5146 , b68 and b59 cores , as well as some lines of sight through the serpens and taurus molecular clouds , the peak optical depth of the 9.7  @xmath0  band relative to the k - band extinction is significantly shallower compared to the diffuse medium . here",
    ", this relation will be revisited with a much larger sample . with a simultaneous analysis of the ices bands ,",
    "some possible explanations of this relation can be addressed , e.g. , the effects of grain growth .",
    "also , in the process of disentangling ice and dust features from the attenuated stellar spectra , an extinction curve needs to be assumed .",
    "broad - band and spectroscopic studies have shown that the extinction remains high even at 25  @xmath0  @xcite . in this work",
    ", this result will be re - assessed , using _ spitzer _",
    "spectra and source - specific models . in the process a high resolution extinction curve will be produced , in which absorption features and continuum extinction can be separated .",
    "finally , this study of isolated dense cores is part of a larger program to investigate dust and ices in a range of environments . while here many cores are observed with a few background stars per core , @xcite study many sight - lines behind one specific core in the ic  5146 region in much detail .",
    "efforts are under way to study large nearby clouds as well .",
    "the selection of the background stars is described in  [ sec : sou ] , and the reduction of the ground - based and _ spitzer _ spectra in  [ sec : obs ] . in  [ sec : cont ] the procedure to fit the stellar continua is presented .",
    "this is a crucial step in the analysis . for this",
    ", a `` high resolution '' extinction curve is needed in which ice and silicate features can be separated from continuum extinction .",
    "this extinction curve is derived in  [ sec : ext ] .",
    "subsequently , in ",
    "[ sec : col ] , the peak and integrated optical depths of the ice and dust features are derived , as well as column densities for the known identifications . then in  [ sec:60 ] , the derived parameters are correlated with each other and with previously studied ysos . in ",
    "[ sec : dis1 ] , the comparison of ice abundances in the background stars and ysos is discussed , followed by a discussion on observational tracers of ice processing in  [ sec : dis2 ] . ",
    "[ sec : dis3 ] shows how the observations of the ices further constrain explanations for the deviating extinction curve and @xmath15 versus @xmath16 relation in dense clouds .",
