    "the very high energy ( vhe ) gamma - ray astrophysics has grown significantly with the newest generation of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) .",
    "their high sensitivities allow to discover tens of vhe sources including galactic objects like supernova remnants , pulsar wind nebulae , binary systems , and the extragalactic active galactic nuclei , gamma - ray bursts and starburst galaxies . the standalone magic telescope , as the largest single - dish iact with the lowest energy threshold among the current generation of iacts , contributed significantly to this field .",
    "its energy threshold of 55 gev with the standard trigger can reach 25 gev with the innovative analog sum trigger guaranteeing a good overlap between the vhe ground - based cherenkov telescopes and the new generation of he satellites .",
    "this is a remarkable fact in the context of multi - wavelength studies .",
    "+ the magic telescope , located on the canary island of la palma on the roque de los muchachos observatory at 2250 m a.s.l , has a sensitivity of @xmath0 1.6 @xmath1 of the crab flux in 50 hours of observations and an energy resolution around 15@xmath1 at energies above 200 gev . from autumn 2009 on , a second magic telescope allows stereoscopic observations @xcite .",
    "thus , the sensitivity has improved substantially and will enable a deeper view of our galaxy possible .",
    "+ this paper presents an overview of the latest results from galactic observations .",
    "the latest results on the extragalactic sources are described elsewhere in these proceedings @xcite .",
    "the magic telescope has detected vhe emission from 9 galactic objects : crab nebula , the galactic center , hess j1813 , hess j1834 , the snrs cassiopeia a and ic443 , the x - ray binary lsi 61 + 303 , the unidentified egret source tev 2032 and the crab pulsar . on top",
    "the magic collaboration found an evidence of signal from the microquasar cyg - x1 .",
    "+ this paper highlights magic contributions to the galactic astrophysics in the last two years .      the crab pulsar ( psr b0531 + 21 ) , detected by egret up to 5 gev , had never been detected in the vhe domain above 100 gev by any iact .",
    "the low energy threshold of magic combined with the novel analog sum trigger developed by magic has allowed to lower the energy threshold down to only 25 gev ; hence to detect the crab pulsations in the high energy domain for the first time@xcite . + a sample of 22.3 h of good quality data taken in winter 2007/2008 has been selected to perform the analysis of the pulsed emission and simultaneous optical observations have been used to verify the absolute arrival time of the photons .",
    "the two signal regions have been selected a priori by using the definition of the main pulse ( p1 ) and the inter - pulse ( p2 ) given by egret @xcite and the background has been estimated from the remaining events outside the these intervals . in this way",
    "a significance of 6.4 @xmath2 has been obtained above 25 gev .",
    "p1 and p2 have similar amplitudes at e = 25 gev , in contrast with the measurements at lower energies ( e @xmath3 100 mev ) where p1 is dominant @xcite .",
    "the data sample shows a small excess ( 3.4 @xmath2 ) above 60 gev for p2 , which is consistent with our previous crab observation @xcite .",
    "this reveals a trend of p2/p1 increasing with energy : it is @xmath4 0.5 at 100 mev , @xmath5 at 25 gev and @xmath3 1 at 60 gev .",
    "this trend provides valuable information for theoretical studies which will constrain the location of the emission region in the pulsar magnetosphere . + to evaluate the energy cutoff , an extrapolation of the egret data has been performed by assuming two different cutoff shapes . by assuming an exponential cutoff the measured signal is compatible with an energy cutoff of e = 17.7 @xmath6 2.8 @xmath6 5.0 gev . in case",
    "the cut off is super - exponential the estimated cut off energy is e = 23.2 @xmath6 2.9 @xmath6 8.8 gev .",
    "the high values obtained for the cutoff strongly disfavored the polar cap model . + the crab pulsar has been detected recently by the fermi collaboration which estimates a spectrum cutoff at 5.8 @xmath6 0.5 @xmath6 1.2 gev @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ figcrabpulsar ] ) .",
    "the flux calculated by magic at gev is consistent with the extrapolation of the fermi spectrum .",
    "nevertheless the cutoff is marginally consistent with the fermi one also taking into account the systematic errors .",
    "+      the crab nebula is a pulsar wind nebula considered as the standard candle of the vhe @xmath7-ray astrophysics due to its incredible brightness .",
    "thanks to its low energy threshold the magic experiment measured the crab nebula spectrum down to 60 gev .",
    "the spectrum follows a curved power law which is consistent with inverse compton emission .",
    "the obtained spectral energy distribution suggests the position of the inverse compton peak at 77 @xmath6 47 gev@xcite .",
    "this position can be better determined with the new array of two magic telescopes and it will be of great importance also for the cross calibration between the iacts and the fermi satellite .",
    "globular clusters ( gc ) are compact groups of old stars and evolved objects like millisecond pulsars ( msp ) .",
    "gcs have been predicted to produce tev @xmath7-rays by accelerated leptons scattering off photons of the microwave background radiation or the thermal emission of the star population inside the gc .",
    "acceleration of leptons could take place either in the shocks coming from the collisions of the winds of msps or inside the pulsar inner magnetosphere .",
    "+ magic observed the globular cluster m13,located at a distance of 7 kpc , where 5 msps has been detected by now .",
    "the observation was carried out for 20.7 hours in june and july 2007 @xcite .",
    "no signal has been found either in correspondence to the center of m13 position or in a region of 1 degree of radius around the source itself for an energy range extending from 140 gev to 1.1 tev .",
    "+ the obtained integral flux upper limit for energies above 200 gev is @xmath8 .",
    "it has been calculated at 95@xmath1 cl by using the rolke method and assuming a spectral index of -2.6 .",
    "the obtained result compared with the theoretical spectra calculated in bednarek @xmath9 sitarek s model @xcite ( see fig . [ fig_m13 ] ) suggests that either the number of msps in m13 is significantly lower than the estimate of @xmath0 100 , or the conversion efficiency from msps to relativistic leptons is significantly below the theoretical predictions of the models of the high energy processes in msp magnetosphere .",
    "+        supernova remnants ( snr ) are believed to be the acceleration sites of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "therefore , they were expected to produce vhe @xmath7-rays as confirmed by the current generation of iacts . + in 2007 and 2008 the magic telescope performed a deep observation on tycho and the crab nebula and shorter observations on various selected radio snrs @xcite .",
    "+ tycho is a young shell - type snr which is expected to be located at 3.5 kpc .",
    "it shows 8 diameter both in x - rays and radio frequencies , making it almost a point - like source for cherenkov telescopes .",
    "its vhe emission has been predicted by the non linear kinetic ( nlk ) theory of cosmic ray acceleration in snrs . in such models",
    "the dominant mechanism is the @xmath10 decay , rather then inverse compton , which , however , can not be ruled out . the magic telescope observed this source for 70 hours between july and november 2007 without detecting any vhe emission above 350 gev .",
    "the integral flux upper limit , calculated at 99.9@xmath1 cl , corresponds to @xmath02@xmath1 of the crab flux at the same energy ( 1.86@xmath11 ) .",
    "this non - detection suggests that tycho is more distant than the expected 3.5 kpc in the context of the nlk theory .",
    "+ the magic collaboration has selected also 8 good snr candidates from the green catalogue of snrs according to the following criteria : i ) flux at 1 ghz larger than 49 jy ; ii ) radio spectral index lower than 0.6 ; iii ) distance smaller than 7 kpc ; iv ) age lower than 50000 y. the selected snrs , hb-9 , w51 , ctb-80 , w63 , w66 , hb-21 , ctb-104a , g85.9 - 0.6 and g85.4 + 0.7 , were observed for a time varying from 5 to 10 hours each .",
    "no point - like emission has been found from any of the selected snrs and the integral flux upper limits ( 3@xmath2 ) for energies above 270 gev are shown in table [ tab : snrs ] . in case of w51 a hint of signal at the level of 3@xmath2 ( pre - trail ) has been found in correspondence to the milagro j1923.0 + 1411 source .",
    "+          wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars represent an evolved stage of hot ( @xmath12 @xmath3 20000k ) , massive stars characterized by strong winds . the colliding winds of massive star binaries are predicted to produce vhe @xmath7-rays through leptonic and hadronic processes .",
    "nevertheless , this prediction has never been proven .",
    "+ the magic telescope observed for the first time two isolated wr star binaries@xcite : w146 for 44.5 h between 2005 and 2007 , and w147 for 30.3 h in 2007 .",
    "searches of @xmath7-rays from these two objects have given no positive results for energies above 80 gev .",
    "the integral flux upper limits at 95@xmath1 cl are 1.1 @xmath13 @xmath14 ph @xmath15 @xmath16 ( 1.5@xmath1 crab flux ) and 3.5 @xmath13 @xmath14 ph @xmath15 @xmath16 ( 5@xmath1 crab flux ) respectively for w147 and w146 . according to this result , the reimer s model for w147 @xcite can be excluded for most of the orbital phases ( see fig . [ fig_w147 ] ) .",
    "+    -ray flux at phase 0.25 and 0.5 is reduced by @xmath4 0.3@xmath1 and @xmath4 18@xmath1 respectively as a result of absorption of @xmath7-rays in stellar radiation in @xmath17 pair production process .",
    "no absorption takes place at phase 0 .",
