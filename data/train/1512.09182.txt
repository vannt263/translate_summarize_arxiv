    "the band structure of a material represents the relation between wavenumber ( or wave vector ) and frequency , and thus it relates the spatial and temporal characteristics of wave motion in the material .",
    "this relation is of paramount importance in numerous disciplines of science and engineering such as electronics , photonics and phononics .",
    "@xcite it is well - known that periodic materials exhibit gaps in the band structure , @xcite referred to as _ band gaps _ or _",
    "stop bands_. in these gaps , waves are attenuated whereby propagating waves are effectively forbidden .",
    "their defining properties are the frequency range , i.e. , position and width , as well as the depth in the imaginary part of the wavenumber spectrum , which describes the level of attenuation .    in the realm of elastic wave propagation ,",
    "band gaps are usually created by two different phenomena : bragg scattering or local resonance .",
    "bragg scattering occurs due to the periodicity of a material or structure , where waves scattered at the interfaces cause coherent destructive interference , effectively cancelling the propagating waves .",
    "research on waves in periodic structures dates , at least , back to newton s attempt to derive a formula for the speed of sound in air , see e.g. , chapter 1 in ref . for a historical review before the 1950 s .",
    "later review papers on wave propagation in periodic media include refs . .",
    "the concept of local resonance is based on the transfer of vibrational energy to a resonator , i.e. , a part of the material / structure that vibrates at characteristic frequencies . within structural dynamics , the concept dates back , at least , to frahm s patent application @xcite and since , dynamic vibration absorbers and tuned mass dampers have been areas of extensive research within structural vibration suppression . in the field of elastic band gaps ,",
    "the concept of local resonance is often considered within the framework of periodic structures , as presented in the seminal paper of liu et al .",
    ", @xcite where band - gaps are created for acoustic waves using periodically distributed internal resonators .",
    "the periodic distribution of the resonators does not change the local resonance effects , however it does introduce additional bragg scattering at higher frequencies , as well as allow for a unit - cell wave based description of the medium .",
    "local resonance has also been used in the context of attaching resonators to a continuous structure , such as a rod @xcite , beam @xcite or a plate @xcite in order to attenuate waves by creating band gaps in the low frequency range .",
    "a problem with this approach in general , which has severely limited proliferation to industrial applications , is that the resonators need to be rather heavy for a practically significant gap to open up .",
    "another means for creating band gaps is by the concept of inertial amplification ( ia ) as proposed by yilmaz and collaborators in refs . .",
    "in this approach , which has received less attention in the literature , inertial forces are enhanced between two points in a structure consisting of a periodically repeated mechanism .",
    "this generates _ anti - resonance _ frequencies , where the enhanced inertia effectively cancels the elastic force ; see e.g. ref . where two levered mass - spring systems are analysed for their performance in generating stop bands .",
    "while it is possible to enhance the inertia between two points by means of masses , springs and levers , a specific mechanical element , _ the inerter _ , @xcite was created as the ideal inertial equivalent of springs and dampers , providing a force proportional to the relative acceleration between two points .",
    "this concept , while primarily used in vehicle suspension systems , @xcite has been utilized in refs . in the context of generating band gaps in lattice materials by inertial amplification where the same underlying physical phenomenon is used for generating the anti - resonance frequencies .",
    "the frequency responses to various harmonic loadings were obtained , numerically and experimentally , and low - frequency , wide and deep band gaps were indeed observed for these novel lattice structures . in ref .",
    ", size and shape optimization is shown to increase the band gap width further , as illustrated by a frequency - domain investigation .",
    "until now , both inerters and inertial amplification mechanisms have been used as a backbone structural component in discrete or continuous systems . in this paper",
    ", we propose to use inertial amplification to generate band gaps in conventional continuous structures , by attaching light - weight mechanisms to a host structure , such as a rod , beam , plate or membrane , without disrupting its continuous nature ( therefore not obstructing its main structural integrity and functionality ) . with this approach",
    ", we envision the inertial amplification effect to be potentially realized in the form a _ surface coating _ , to be used for sound and vibration control .    for proof of concept",
    ", we consider a simple one - dimensional case by analyzing an elastic rod , with an inertial amplification mechanism periodically attached .",
    "the mechanism is inspired by that analyzed in ref .",
    ", however the application to a continuous structure increases the practicality and richness of the problem considerably and several novel effects are illustrated .",
    "our investigation focuses mainly on the unit - cell band - structure characteristics .",
    "however , we also compare our findings from the analysis of the material problem to transmissibility results for structures comprising a finite number of unit cells .",
    "the finite systems are modelled by the finite - element ( fe ) method .",
    "in order to utilize the concept of inertial amplification in a surface setting as proposed , the mechanisms should be much smaller than the host structure , such that their distributed attachment does not change the main function of the structure , nor occupy a significant amount of space .",
    "fulfilling this constraint requires a relatively large effect with only a modest increase in mass .",
    "considering the ideal mechanical element , the _ inerter _ , we know that the factor of proportionality , the inertance , can be much larger than the actual mass increase , as demonstrated experimentally in refs . .",
    "we propose to utilize the same effect using a mechanism similar to the one considered in refs . .",
    "our two - dimensional interpretation of the system may be viewed as a plate with a comparably small inertial amplification mechanisms distributed over the host - structure . in principle",
    ", the distributed effect of the mechanisms , in the long wave - limit , reduces to the notion of an inertially - modified constitutive relation in the elastodynamic equations .      in this study , we restrict ourselves to a one - dimensional structure with an inertial amplification mechanism attached , as illustrated in fig .",
