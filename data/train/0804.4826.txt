    "it is well - known that qcd is a fundamental theory of strong interactions both in the vacuum and in hot and/or dense baryonic matter .",
    "however , it can be successfully used only in the region of high energies , temperatures and densities ( or chemical potentials ) , where a weak - coupling expansion is applicable . away from this region , different nonperturbative methods or effective theories such as chiral effective lagrangians as well as nambu  jona - lasinio type models ( see , e.g. , the papers @xcite and references therein ) , are usually employed for the consideration of light meson physics , phase transitions in dense quark matter , etc . in particular , motivated by the fact that in heavy - ion collisions and compact stars the hadronic matter is isotopically asymmetric , different qcd - like effective models were studied at nonzero isospin chemical potential @xmath1 @xcite . there",
    "the charged pion condensation phenomenon , which is generated if @xmath1 is greater than the pion mass @xmath12 , was also considered .    in all",
    "above mentioned papers the effective models are i ) field theories in usual ( 3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime , and ii ) they are employed for the description of qcd at _ rather low _ energies and densities . at the same time there is another class of theories that can be used as a laboratory for a qualitative consideration of qcd at _ arbitrary _ energies .",
    "these are the so - called gross - neveu ( gn ) type models , i.e. two - dimensional quantum field theories with four - fermion interactions @xcite .",
    "renormalizability , asymptotic freedom as well as the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry ( in the vacuum ) are the most fundamental features that are inherent both for qcd and all gn type models .",
    "in addition , the gn phase portrait in terms of baryon chemical potential @xmath13 vs temperature resembles qualitatively to a great extent the qcd phase diagram @xcite . due to their relative simplicity in the leading order of a large @xmath14-expansion ( @xmath14 is a number of colored quarks ) ,",
    "it is very convenient to use gn models for considering such a phenomenon of dense qcd as color superconductivity @xcite and to elaborate new nonperturbative methods of quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "moreover , the influence of the space compactification on chiral symmetry breaking both in the vacuum ( @xmath15 ) @xcite and in dense baryon matter ( @xmath16 ) @xcite was studied in terms of gn models ( see also the appropriate papers @xcite ) .    before investigating different physical effects relevant to a real ( 3 + 1)-dimensional world in the framework of two - dimensional gn models ,",
    "let us recall that there is a no - go theorem forbidding the spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "however , at present time it is well understood ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite ) that in the limit @xmath17 this no - go theorem does not apply .",
    "this makes it possible to study symmetry breaking effects in terms of gn models as well , but only in the leading order of the @xmath18-expansion , where most low dimensional theories are exactly solvable . in this sense , for @xmath17 , low dimensional quark models are physically more tractable and appealing than at finite @xmath14 .    in the present paper",
    "the pion condensation phenomenon is investigated in the framework of the two - dimensional gn model with two massless quark flavors .",
    "in particular , we shall study the influence of the finiteness of the system size on this phenomenon .",
    "so our consideration is performed in a spacetime with non - trivial topology , i.e. on the @xmath0 manifold with compactified space coordinate , and the gn model is extended by an isospin chemical potential @xmath1 ( for simplicity , we put @xmath15 ) . obviously , the latter issue is motivated by the physics of compact stars , where pion condensation might be realized as a consequence of the isotopic asymmetry of baryon matter . since",
    "all the calculations are carried out on the basis of the leading order of @xmath18-expansion ( i.e. in the case @xmath2 ) we expect that all conclusions concerning the pion condensation phenomenon , caused by a spontaneous breaking of the continuous isospin symmetry , remain qualitatively valid for real qcd .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional model which describes dense quark matter with two massless quark flavors ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 quarks ) .",
    "its lagrangian has the form @xmath22q+ \\frac { g}{n_c}\\big [ ( \\bar qq)^2+(\\bar q\\mathrm{i}\\gamma^5\\vec\\tau q)^2 \\big ] ,   \\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the quark field @xmath23 is a flavor doublet ( @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) and color @xmath14-plet ( @xmath26 ) as well as a two - component dirac spinor ( the summation in ( [ 1 ] ) over flavor , color , and spinor indices is implied ) ; @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) are pauli matrices ; the baryon chemical potential @xmath13 in ( [ 1 ] ) is responsible for the non - zero baryon density of quark matter , whereas the isospin chemical potential @xmath1 is switched on in order to study properties of quark matter at nonzero isospin densities ( in this case the densities of @xmath20 and @xmath21 quarks are different ) .",
    "evidently , the model ( [ 1 ] ) is a generalization of the two - dimensional gross - neveu model @xcite with a single massless quark color @xmath14-plet to the case of two quark flavors and additional chemical potentials . as a result",
    ", we have in the case under consideration a more complicated chiral symmetry group . indeed , at @xmath29",
    "apart from the global color su(@xmath14 ) symmetry , the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) is invariant under transformations from the chiral @xmath30 group .",
    "however , at @xmath31 this symmetry is reduced to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the third component of the isospin operator ( here and above the subscripts @xmath34 mean that the corresponding group acts only on the left , right handed spinors , respectively ) .",
    "evidently , this symmetry can also be presented as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the isospin subgroup and @xmath37 is the axial isospin subgroup .",
    "quarks are transformed under these subgroups as @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "recall for the following that   @xmath40 ,   @xmath41 . ]",
    "the linearized version of the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) , which contains composite bosonic fields @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xmath44 , has the following form ( in what follows , we use the notation @xmath45 for the quark chemical potential ) : @xmath46q   -\\frac{n_c}{4g}\\big [ \\sigma\\sigma+\\pi_a\\pi_a\\big ] .",

    "furthermore , it is clear from ( [ 200 ] ) and footnote [ f1,1 ] that the bosonic fields transform under the isospin @xmath36 and axial isospin @xmath48 subgroups in the following manner : @xmath49 starting from the theory ( [ 2 ] ) , one obtains in the leading order of the large @xmath14-expansion ( i.e. in the one - fermion loop approximation ) the following path integral expression for the effective action @xmath50 of the bosonic @xmath42 and @xmath43 fields : @xmath51[dq]\\exp\\bigl(\\mathrm{i}\\int\\tilde l\\,d^2 x\\bigr),\\ ] ] where @xmath52+\\tilde { \\cal s}_{\\rm { eff } } , \\label{3}\\ ] ] @xmath53 is a normalization constant . the quark contribution to the effective action , i.e. the term @xmath54 in ( [ 3 ] ) ,",
    "is given by : @xmath55[dq]\\exp\\bigl(\\mathrm{i}\\int\\big [ \\bar q\\mathrm{d}q\\big ] d^2 x\\bigr)=[{\\mathop{\\rm det}\\nolimits}d]^{n_c}.   \\label{4}\\ ] ] in ( [ 4 ] ) we have used the notation @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the unit operator in the @xmath14-dimensional color space and @xmath58 is the dirac operator , which acts in the flavor- , spinor- as well as coordinate spaces only . using the general formula @xmath59 , one obtains for the effective action the following expression @xmath60-\\mathrm{i}n_c{\\rm tr}_{sfx}\\ln d , \\label{6}\\ ] ] where the tr - operation stands for the trace in spinor- ( @xmath61 ) , flavor- ( @xmath62 ) as well as two - dimensional coordinate- ( @xmath63 ) spaces , respectively .",
    "using ( [ 6 ] ) , we obtain the thermodynamic potential ( tdp ) @xmath64 of the system : @xmath65 where the @xmath66- and @xmath67 fields are now @xmath63-independent quantities , and in the round brackets of ( [ 7 ] ) just the momentum space representation , @xmath68 , of the dirac operator @xmath69 appears . evidently , @xmath70@xmath71 , where the summation over all four eigenvalues @xmath72 of the 4@xmath734 matrix @xmath68 is implied and @xmath74 hence , @xmath75\\big [ ( p_0+\\mu)^2-\\varepsilon_{-}^2\\big ] \\big\\ } , \\label{9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 the tdp @xmath64 is symmetric under the transformations @xmath77 and/or @xmath78 .",
    "hence , it is sufficient to consider only the region @xmath79 . in this case",
    ", one can integrate in ( [ 9 ] ) over @xmath80 with the help of the formula @xmath81= \\frac{\\mathrm{i}}2\\big\\{|a - b|+|a+b|\\big\\ } \\label{1000}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( which is valid up to an infinite constant independent of quantities @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) and obtain : @xmath84 ( to get the second line in ( [ 11 ] ) we used the relations @xmath85 and @xmath86 . ) in what follows we are going to investigate the @xmath87-dependence of the global minimum point of the function @xmath64 vs @xmath88 . to simplify the task ,",
    "let us note that both the quasiparticle energies ( [ 10 ] ) and hence the tdp ( [ 11 ] ) depend effectively only on the two combinations @xmath89 and @xmath90 of the bosonic fields , which are invariants with respect to the @xmath35 group , as is easily seen from ( [ 201 ] ) .",
    "in this case , without loss of generality , one can put @xmath91 in ( [ 11 ] ) , and study the tdp as a function of only two variables , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "then the global minimum point of the tdp @xmath94 , @xmath95 is the solution of the system of gap equations @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "evidently , the coordinates @xmath100 and @xmath101 of the global minimum point of the tdp ( [ 12 ] ) supply us with two order parameters ( gaps ) , which are proportional to the ground state expectation values of the form @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively . if the gap @xmath100 is nonzero , then in the ground state of the model the axial isospin symmetry @xmath48 ( at @xmath104 ) is spontaneously broken down .",
    "moreover , if the gap @xmath105 , then in the ground state , corresponding to the phase with charged pion condensation , the isospin @xmath36 symmetry is spontaneously broken down .      since at @xmath107 , @xmath108 the phase structure of different gn models was reasonably well studied both in two dimensions @xcite and in three dimensions @xcite ( in the last case the four - fermion theories are also renormalizable ) , in this subsection we shall study for simplicity the model ( [ 1 ] ) only at zero quark chemical potential , i.e. at @xmath106 , but @xmath104 .",
    "the corresponding tdp will be denoted as @xmath109 and can be obtained from ( [ 12 ] ) : @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 is the tdp of the system in the vacuum , i.e. at @xmath29 . in the vacuum",
    "the tdp is usually called effective potential : @xmath113 it is easily seen that both the tdp ( [ 14 ] ) and the effective potential ( [ 15 ] ) are formally ultraviolet ( uv ) divergent quantities .",
    "so , a few words are needed about the renormalization procedure of the initial model .",
    "it is well known that all four - fermion theories of the type ( [ 1 ] ) are renormalizable in two dimensional spacetime @xcite . moreover , in the leading order of the large @xmath14 expansion only the coupling constant should be renormalized in order to obtain finite ( renormalized ) expressions for different quantities ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it means that the bare coupling constant @xmath114 of the model ( [ 1 ] ) depends on the cutoff parameter @xmath115 , @xmath116 , in such a way that all uv divergences , arising from loop integrations when @xmath117 , are compensated by corresponding terms of @xmath118 . as a consequence ,",
    "in the limit @xmath117 one must necessarily obtain finite expressions for physical quantities .",
    "of course , different renormalization procedures result in different expressions for the bare coupling constant @xmath118 .",
    "however , physical consequences of the theory do not depend on the concrete renormalization scheme . taking this last remark into account ,",
    "let us next discuss how to obtain finite renormalized expression for the tdp ( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "we see here two ways . on the one hand",
    ", one could find an expression for the bare coupling constant @xmath114 such that the uv divergence , arising from the integral in the first line of ( [ 14 ] ) , would be compensated by the term with @xmath114 .",
    "evidently , in this case @xmath114 depends both on the cutoff @xmath115 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , we find it more convenient to consider the second way . in this case , one should first of all note that the integral in the second line of ( [ 14 ] ) is a convergent quantity , and the whole uv divergence is located in the effective potential @xmath112 .",
    "hence , there is a possibility to remove uv divergences using a bare coupling constant which does not depend on @xmath1 .",
    "namely , let us choose @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the dynamical mass of quarks in the vacuum ( for more details , see appendix [ apa ] ) . then , substituting ( [ 16 ] ) into ( [ 15 ] ) and restricting there the range of integration by using the cutoff parameter @xmath115 , it is possible to obtain for @xmath121 the expression ( moreover , we omit an inessential infinite constant independent of @xmath122 ) : @xmath123 . \\label{17}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath120 might be considered as a free model parameter , it follows from ( [ 16])-([17 ] ) that the renormalization procedure of the gn model is accompanied by the dimensional transmutation phenomenon . indeed , in the initial unrenormalized expressions both for @xmath109 and @xmath112 ( see ( [ 14 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) , respectively )",
    "the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath114 is present , whereas after renormalization the effective potential ( [ 17 ] ) is characterized by a dimensional free model parameter @xmath120 .    due to the relation ( [ 17 ] ) , one can show that the gap equations for the renormalized tdp ( [ 14 ] ) might have no more than three different solutions .",
    "two of them , @xmath124 and @xmath125 , are present at arbitrary values of @xmath126 , whereas the third one , @xmath127 , appears only at @xmath128 .",
    "however , for arbitrary @xmath129 a global minimum point of the tdp @xmath109 lies at the point @xmath130 .",
    "this means that in the model ( [ 1 ] ) the isospin symmetry is always broken down and a charged pion condensate which is equal to the quark mass @xmath120 in the vacuum , is created if @xmath131 .",
    "since in the vacuum case ( @xmath132 ) chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken down in the model ( [ 1 ] ) , there must exist three massless nambu ",
    "goldstone bosons which are pions , i.e. @xmath133 .",
    "so , we have proved that in the framework of the model ( [ 1 ] ) the pion condensation phase is realized at @xmath134 , where @xmath12 is the pion mass in the vacuum .",
    "just the same phase structure is predicted by qcd at @xmath135 , @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the framework of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional njl - type models the pion condensation is not allowed for sufficiently high values of the isospin chemical potential @xcite .",
    "this fact supports the statement made in the introduction that the njl approach is only valid at rather small energies ( chemical potentials ) .",
    "moreover , we have once more demonstrated that in the leading order of the large @xmath14-expansion the two - dimensional gn models are a quite good theoretical laboratory for qualitative qcd investigations .",
    "so we are in a position to believe that the results obtained in the next sections are also inherent to qcd .",
    "in the present section we continue the investigation of the charged pion condensation , this time under the influence of the finite volume occupied by the system .",
    "this is obviously a reasonable task , since all physical effects take place in restricted space regions .",
    "the consideration of the problem is significantly simplified in the framework of the two - dimensional model ( [ 1 ] ) at @xmath104 , which is again justified by its similarity to qcd .",
    "so we put a system with lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) into a restricted space region of the form @xmath136 ( here @xmath63 is the space coordinate ) .",
    "it is well known that in this case the consideration is equivalent to the investigation of the model in a spacetime with nontrivial topology @xmath0 and with quantum fields , satisfying some boundary conditions of the form @xmath137 where @xmath138 , @xmath4 is the length of the circumference @xmath5 , and the variable @xmath63 means the path along it .",
    "below , we shall use only two values of the parameter @xmath139 : @xmath140 for periodic boundary conditions and @xmath141 for the antiperiodic one .    as a consequence , to obtain the thermodynamic potential @xmath142 of the initial system placed in the restricted domain @xmath136 and at @xmath104 , one must simply replace the integration in ( [ 14 ] ) by an infinite series , using the rule : @xmath143 moreover , instead of @xmath112 it is necessary to use the effective potential @xmath144 of the model in the vacuum ( see appendix [ apa ] ) . as a result",
    ", the tdp ( [ 14 ] ) will be replaced by the corresponding expression for the spacetime of the form @xmath145 , i.e. @xmath146 where @xmath111 , and the function @xmath147 is defined in ( [ a9 ] ) . in what follows , it will be convenient to use the dimensionless quantities @xmath148 where @xmath120 is the dynamical quark mass in the vacuum .",
    "since the phase structure of the model in the two particular cases @xmath3 , @xmath104 and @xmath149 , @xmath107 was already considered in section [ ii.b ] and in the appendix [ apa ] , we will now investigate the phase structure only at @xmath150 .",
    "@xmath151      in this case @xmath152 , and in terms of the dimensionless quantities ( [ 21 ] ) the tdp ( [ 20 ] ) can be rewritten in the following explicit form @xmath153- \\lambda\\sqrt{(m+\\nu)^2+\\delta^2}-\\lambda\\sqrt{(m-\\nu)^2+\\delta^2 } \\nonumber\\\\&-&2\\lambda\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left\\{\\sqrt{\\left ( \\sqrt{m^2+(2n\\lambda)^2}+\\nu\\right ) ^2+\\delta^2}+\\sqrt{\\left ( \\sqrt{m^2+(2n\\lambda)^2}-\\nu\\right ) ^2+\\delta^2}-4n\\lambda- \\frac{m^2+\\delta^2}{2n\\lambda}\\right\\ } , \\label{22}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath154 is the euler s constant @xcite .",

    "moreover , @xmath156 are free parameters there . since the information about the phase structure of the model in the case of the periodic boundary conditions is contained in the global minimum point of the function ( [ 22 ] ) vs @xmath155 , it is first of all necessary to study the gap equations and then to investigate the behavior of the global minimum point vs parameters @xmath156 . in particular , it is possible to show that for each fixed point of the plane @xmath8 ( with @xmath157 and @xmath158 ) the global minimum point of the tdp ( [ 22 ] ) might be located at two different points only , i ) @xmath159 and ii ) @xmath160 , where the nonzero gap @xmath161 is the solution of the equation @xmath162 .",

    "let us denote by @xmath163 the critical curve which separates the region of the @xmath8 plane with symmetric phase from the points @xmath8 , corresponding to the pion condensed phase of the model .",
    "since in each point of the curve @xmath163 there is a phase transition of the second order from the symmetric phase to the pion condensed one and vice versa , the gap @xmath161 must vanish on this curve .",

    "the same phase structure at @xmath104 occurs in the chirally symmetric qcd , where pions are massless particles , so one more common property is found which is shared both by the gn model and qcd . as a result , the assurance that the finite size ( @xmath149 ) effects of the gn model are also inherent to compactified qcd at @xmath104 is raised .    if @xmath4 is finite , then the phase portraits of the model in terms of @xmath7 and @xmath6 are found for the case of periodic ( see fig.1 ) and antiperiodic ( see fig .",
    "3 ) boundary conditions . among the most interesting properties of these phase diagrams",
    "is the fact that the strip @xmath216 lies as a whole inside the pion condensed phase .",
    "we have shown also that the pion condensed gap @xmath161 is an oscillating function vs both @xmath10 ( at fixed @xmath11 ) and @xmath11 ( at fixed @xmath10 ) .",
    "the same is true for other thermodynamic quantities of the model such as pressure , particle densities etc , and is inherent also to the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional njl models with curved spacetimes @xcite or spacetimes with non - trivial topology @xcite .",
    "one more interesting issue should also be mentioned .",
    "although in the present paper the spatially uniform pion condensation was assumed for simplicity , however , for a sufficiently high values of @xmath1 , the pion superfluidity with inhomogeneous condensate might be realized in isotopically asymmetric and spatially infinite quark matter systems @xcite .",
    "a detailed investigation of this possibility in the case of finite space volume is outside the scope of this paper and should be left for further studies in the framework of different qcd - like models including the gn model .",
    "two of the authors ( v.ch.zh . and",
    "are grateful to prof .",
    "m.  mueller - preussker for his kind hospitality during their stay in the particle theory group at the institute of physics of humboldt - university , where part of this work has been done , and also to daad for financial support .",
    "this work was also supported in part by dfg - grant 436 rus 113/477 .",
    "note that in the vacuum and in the @xmath19 spacetime , the expression @xmath217 for the effective potential of the initial model ( [ 1 ] ) can be found starting from the tdp ( [ 9 ] ) at @xmath218 , where without loss of generality it is possible to put @xmath219 ( @xmath220 ) : @xmath221 = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{4g}-2\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{dp_1}{2\\pi } \\sqrt{\\sigma^2+p_1 ^ 2}. \\label{a1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the second equality is obtained with the help of formula ( [ 1000 ] ) . since in ( [ a1 ] ) the last integral is an uv divergent one ,",
    "we regularize it by cutting off the integration region , i.e. supposing that @xmath222 .",
    "the effective potential @xmath223 , as a whole , must be a finite quantity at @xmath117 .",
    "so the uv divergence of the integral term in ( [ a1 ] ) must be compensated by the term with the bare coupling constant @xmath114 , which , of course , has to be a @xmath115-dependent quantity . to find an appropriate expression for @xmath114 ,",
    "let us recall that in the vacuum the chiral symmetry is necessarily broken down in the framework of the model ( [ 1 ] ) , and quarks acquire a nonzero dynamical mass @xmath120 which is a nontrivial solution of the gap equation @xmath224 .",
    "taking into account this circumstance , one can immediately obtain from the gap equation the expression ( [ 16 ] ) for the bare coupling @xmath114 . substituting it in ( [ a1 ] ) , it is possible to get for @xmath225 the effective potential ( [ 17 ] ) of the initial model in the vacuum and in the @xmath226 spacetime .",
    "( more details about the above renormalization procedure for @xmath223 are presented , e.g. , in @xcite ) .",
    "now let us find the effective potential @xmath227 of the model ( [ 1 ] ) , when the spacetime has a nontrivial topology of the form @xmath0 and quark fields obey the most general boundary conditions ( [ 18 ] ) . in this case one can start from the equation ( [ a1 ] ) ,",
    "in which it is necessary to perform the euclidian rotation ( @xmath228 ) and then use the transformations according to the rule ( [ 19 ] ) . as a result",
    ", we have @xmath229 .",
    "\\label{a2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us next use in ( [ a2 ] ) the formula @xmath230 , which is valid up to an infinite constant independent of the parameter @xmath82 , as well as the poisson sum formula @xcite @xmath231 after integration over @xmath80 , one can easily find @xmath232 where @xmath233 is another , equivalent , expression for the effective potential ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "( it is clear from general considerations that at @xmath234 the effective potential @xmath235 must coincide with the effective potential in the @xmath19 spacetime , i.e. with @xmath223 given in ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "looking at the formula ( [ a4 ] ) ( or ( [ a6 ] ) below ) at @xmath234 , one can easily obtain in the right hand side the expression appearing in the right hand side of formula ( [ a5 ] ) .",
    "so , due to the above reason , it is the function @xmath223 . )",
    "moreover , in the following we will use for @xmath223 its renormalized expression ( [ 17 ] ) .",
    "let us integrate in ( [ a4 ] ) over @xmath61 using the well known relation @xcite @xmath236 where @xmath237 is the macdonald function @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath238 due to the relation @xmath239 , it follows from ( [ a6 ] ) that @xmath240 the series in ( [ a7 ] ) can be modified appropriately @xcite , so ( here we use the effective potential @xmath223 in its renormalized form ( [ 17 ] ) ) @xmath241 - 2\\sigma\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left [ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi^2(2n-\\alpha)^2+l^2\\sigma^2}}-\\frac{1}{2n\\pi } \\right ] , \\label{a8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath154 is the euler constant . integrating both sides of ( [ a8 ] ) over @xmath66",
    ", we obtain the final expression for the effective potential @xmath235 of the initial gn model in the vacuum , when the space coordinate is compactified @xmath242 .",
    "\\label{a9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in spite of the fact that ( [ a9 ] ) is valid for arbitrary @xmath243 , we find it more convenient to have another ( equivalent ) expression for the function @xmath235 at @xmath141 .",
    "in this case one can start again from the relation ( [ a8 ] ) , in which in the second series it is necessary to shift the summation index , i.e. @xmath244 .",
    "then , manipulating with convergent infinite sums , we obtain @xmath245 .",
    "\\label{a10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , in order to get the effective potential , one should integrate both sides of this relation over @xmath66 : @xmath246 . \\label{a11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    finally , a few words about the phase structure of the model at finite @xmath4 .",
    "it is clear that if the antiperiodic boundary conditions are imposed on the quark fields , i.e. @xmath141 in ( [ 18 ] ) , the parameter @xmath4 plays the role of the inverse temperature in the ordinary gn model , but only in the vacuum ( with zero chemical potentials ) . in the last case",
    "the critical properties of the gn model are well understood ( see , e.g. , in @xcite ) , so , by analogy , we can conclude that at @xmath247 the global minimum of the effective potential ( [ a11 ] ) lies at the point @xmath248 . in this case the chiral symmetry of the initial gn ( [ 1 ] ) model is not broken .",
    "in contrast , at @xmath249 the effective potential ( [ a11 ] ) has a nontrivial global minimum point . as a result",
    ", chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken down at sufficiently high @xmath4 .",
    "the situation is however quite different at periodic boundary conditions , i.e. if @xmath140 in ( [ 18 ] ) . in this case",
    "the global minimum point of the corresponding effective potential ( [ a9 ] ) lies outside the point @xmath248 for all @xmath250 . indeed",
    ", it is clear from ( [ a8 ] ) that the derivative of this function is negative at sufficiently small values of @xmath66 , so there is always a local maximum of the effective potential at the point @xmath248 , and the chirally broken phase is realized in the model for arbitrary @xmath250 .",
