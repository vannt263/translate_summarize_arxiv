    "in recent years there has been an increasing interest in the geometric treatment of non - holonomic mechanical systems , see , e.g. , @xcite . in particular",
    ", it has been recognised that the hamiltonian formulation of such systems can be stated in terms of an _ almost - poisson _ bracket , that is , a biderivation of functions of phase space , antisymmetric in its arguments but which does not necessarily fulfil the jacobi identity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . therefore , for researchers in this field",
    ", it seems to be usual the conceptual association of the hamiltonian formulation of non - holonomic mechanical systems with almost - poisson structures .    on the other hand ,",
    "there exist non - holonomic systems which , after certain reductions are performed , admit a hamiltonian formulation after a rescaling of time  is carried out , by means of rescaling factors ( sometimes called _ invariant measures _ ) of the reduced vector field of the system .",
    "this is the case for the so - called lr systems , which are systems formulated on compact lie groups endowed with a left - invariant metric and right - invariant non - holonomic constraints . after a rescaling of time ,",
    "their corresponding reduced systems become integrable hamiltonian systems describing geodesic flows on unit spheres @xcite . in @xcite , a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an invariant measure for the reduced dynamics of generalized chaplygin systems of mechanical type",
    "another recent work on this line is @xcite . for a classic treatment of the theory of chaplygin",
    "s reducing multiplier , see section iii-12 of @xcite .",
    "thus , it could be conceptually associated as well the existence of specific rescaling factors for these reduced systems with the possibility of formulating them in a hamiltonian way .",
    "in addition , borisov , mamaev and kilin @xcite have recently found a poisson structure for each studied case of reduced non - holonomic systems , such that the reduced system becomes hamiltonian , with respect to such a structure , after a rescaling , the hamiltonian function being the reduced energy .",
    "the examples treated by them are classical in the literature , consisting mainly of rolling bodies without slipping , namely a rigid body of revolution rolling on a plane , in particular the _ routh s sphere _",
    "( see section  [ sect_routh_sphere ] ) , the rolling disk ( to be treated in section  [ sect_rolling_disk ] ) , the motion of a homogeneous ball on a surface of revolution ( called sometimes _ routh s problem _ , see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and other cases .",
    "there is a strong emphasis in these references in the sense that the poisson structure for each case can be found _ after a rescaling of time _ of the reduced vector field .",
    "our primary motivation for this work was to understand the origin of the two integrals of motion appearing in the mentioned problem of a ball rolling without slipping inside a surface of revolution , which are not given , in general , in an explicit form but being related to the solutions of a system of first order non - autonomous differential equations @xcite .",
    "this also happens in the other mentioned cases .",
    "the results of @xcite suggest that such systems can be interpreted as the equations providing a set of functionally independent casimir functions of the poisson structure they find for each specific case .",
    "therefore , it seemed to be worth investigating further such poisson structures , in particular to clarify their domain of definition and basic properties .",
    "let us note that another recent approach , devoted to the study of poisson structures which can be associated to never vanishing vector fields on manifolds of arbitrary dimension @xmath0 , with _ fibrating periodic flows _",
    ", is given in @xcite .",
    "it follows that the previously mentioned poisson structures have a rather peculiar form .",
    "in particular , the associated characteristic distributions have rank two in the open sets of the reduced spaces considered in @xcite .",
    "this property implies that such poisson structures , when multiplied by a never vanishing function , are again poisson structures of the same type .",
    "the immediate consequence is that the above mentioned reduced non - holonomic systems are already hamiltonian with respect to one of these poisson structures without any need of rescaling .",
    "other interesting result is that , in the cases studied , the poisson structures obtained can be extended from their original domains of definition , namely ( open sets of ) semialgebraic subvarieties of @xmath1 , to an open set of the ambient space .",
    "such extended poisson structures become zero only at the so - called _ singular equilibria _ of the reduced systems . moreover , the existence of these ( extended ) poison structures , from an algebraic point of view , is only caused by the existence of integrals of motion of the reduced vector field related to the solutions of the mentioned systems of first order differential equations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ pois_str_rank2 ]",
    "we briefly review some notions of poisson geometry and in particular , of poisson structures of rank two . in section  [ pois_str_rank2 ]",
    "we show the explicit expressions of certain bivectors in @xmath2 and @xmath1 , determined up to a non - vanishing factor function , by choosing the 1-forms in their kernels to have a specific form , and we prove that they are in fact poisson bivectors of rank two .",
    "section  [ sect_of_examples ] is devoted to show the application of the previous results in specific examples , namely , the rolling disk , the routh s sphere , and the ball rolling on a surface of revolution .",
    "we will use the formulation of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively , of these problems , rather than that of @xcite .",
    "however , we point out the equivalence of both treatments in the last case .",
    "we also treat the special case of a ball rolling inside a cylinder .",
    "finally , we end with some conclusions and an outlook for further research .",
    "for the sake of completeness and in order to fix some notations , we will recall some well - known notions on poisson manifolds , and in particular , we will focus on poisson structures of rank two . for more details",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .    given a differentiable manifold @xmath3 , a _ poisson structure _ on @xmath3",
    "is defined by an antisymmetric bilinear map @xmath4 which is a derivation on both of its arguments , satisfying moreover the jacobi identity .",
    "a manifold @xmath3 endowed with a poisson structure is called a _ poisson manifold_.    thus ,",
    "it is possible to associate to each function @xmath5 a unique vector field @xmath6 such that , for any other function @xmath7 , we have @xmath8 . the vector field @xmath6 is called _ hamiltonian vector field _ associated to the _ hamiltonian function _",
    "this association defines an homomorphism of the lie algebra @xmath9 onto the lie algebra of vector fields in @xmath3 .",
    "a _ casimir function _ or _ casimir _ for short , is a function @xmath10 such that @xmath11 .",
    "the poisson structure is called _ non degenerate _ if only the constant functions are casimir functions .",
    "moreover , on every poisson manifold , there exists a unique twice contravariant antisymmetric tensor field ( called _ bivector field _ for short ) @xmath12 such that @xmath13 for every pair of functions @xmath14 .",
    "this tensor field is called the _ poisson tensor _ of the structure , and the manifold @xmath3 , endowed with its poisson structure , will be denoted @xmath15 .",
    "the existence of such a tensor field is due only to the antisymmetry and derivation properties of the poisson bracket .",
    "the fulfillment of the jacobi identity for the poisson bracket is equivalent @xcite to the vanishing of the _ schouten  nijenhuis bracket _ of @xmath12 with itself , @xmath16=0 $ ] .",
    "the schouten ",
    "nijenhuis bracket @xcite is the unique extension of the lie bracket of vector fields to the exterior algebra of multivector fields .",
    "some of its properties are @xmath17=-(-1)^{(p-1)(q-1)}[q , p ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & [ p , q\\wedge r]=[p , q]\\wedge r+(-1)^{(p-1)q } q\\wedge[p , r ] \\label{props_scho}\\\\ & & [ p\\wedge r , q]=p\\wedge[r , q]+(-1)^{(q-1)r } [ p , q]\\wedge r   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 are completely antisymmetric contravariant tensors of degree @xmath19 , respectively . for more details and properties on the schouten ",
    "nijenhuis bracket see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "take a local chart of @xmath3 , with domain @xmath20 and associated local coordinates @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath23 , ( @xmath24 ) the components of the poisson tensor @xmath12 in the previous chart .",
    "the expression of the poisson bracket of the restriction of the two functions @xmath25 to @xmath20 , also denoted by @xmath25 , reads @xmath26 where summation in the repeated indices is understood .",
    "in particular we have @xmath27 .",
    "the poisson tensor admits the local expression @xmath28 in these coordinates .",
    "given a poisson manifold @xmath15 , it can be defined the fibered morphism @xmath29 such that for any pair of 1-forms @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the image of the morphism @xmath33 , @xmath34 , is called _ the characteristic distribution _ of the poisson structure , and the _ characteristic space _ on @xmath35 is the vectorial subspace @xmath36 of @xmath37 .",
    "the _ rank _ of the structure on the point @xmath38 is the rank of @xmath39 , i.e. , the dimension of @xmath40 .",
    "note that the annihilator of the characteristic distribution , i.e. , @xmath41 , is @xmath42 , and we have @xmath43 , for all @xmath35 . in general , the rank of the structure varies with @xmath38 and thus @xmath44 is not in general a subbundle of @xmath45 .",
    "consider now a poisson manifold @xmath15 , @xmath46 , such that in the domain of a local chart @xmath47 the structure has constant rank equal to two .",
    "the theorem 11.5 of chapter iii in @xcite ( or corollary 2.3 . in @xcite ) assures us that the associated local coordinates , denoted @xmath48 , can be chosen such that for @xmath49 , @xmath50    we are now in a position to prove a simple result , but important for our purposes here :    let @xmath15 be a poisson manifold of ( locally ) constant rank equal to two .",
    "then , for each never vanishing smooth function @xmath51 , @xmath52 is a poisson manifold of ( locally ) constant rank equal to two , with the same characteristic distribution .",
    "[ prop_conf ]    _ proof _    we have to prove that the schouten ",
    "nijenhuis bracket @xmath53 $ ] vanishes , the other needed properties being obvious . from the paragraph 18.8 of chapter",
    "v of @xcite , we have that @xmath54=2 a\\ , \\l^\\sharp(da)\\wedge \\l\\,.\\ ] ] it suffices to compute the previous expression on a coordinate neighbourhood like that described in the previous paragraph , with respect to the poisson tensor @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath54(dx , dy , dz_k ) = 2 a ( \\l^\\sharp(da)\\wedge \\l)(dx , dy , dz_k)=0\\,,\\quad 1\\leq k\\leq n-2\\,,\\ ] ] because @xmath55 are casimir functions of @xmath12 , and @xmath56 enter at least once as argument of @xmath12 in all terms of the previous expression . for other possible arguments",
    "the expression vanishes by the same reason .",
    "let @xmath3 be a @xmath57-dimensional manifold and @xmath58 , @xmath59 two vector fields such that for all @xmath35 , the lie bracket @xmath60_x$ ] belongs to the subspace of @xmath37 generated by @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "then , @xmath63 is a poisson tensor of rank two except where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are linearly dependent .",
    "this is easily seen by deducing from the properties of the schouten",

    "we will construct in this section some poisson structures of rank two in @xmath2 and @xmath1 by imposing that the kernel of the corresponding bivectors consists of a set of two and three specific 1-forms , respectively .",
    "such 1-forms will determine codistributions which are integrable in the sense of frobenius .",
    "we will prove that the resulting bivectors are in fact poisson .",
    "consider the euclidean space @xmath2 , with coordinates @xmath71 .",
    "the equations of motion of the reduced non - holonomic systems encountered in the examples are observed to have integrals of motion which are related to the solutions of a system of differential equations of the type @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , are two given ( smooth ) functions of their arguments , which do not include @xmath75 .",
    "we consider the system ( [ syst_first_ints ] ) as the pfaffian system @xmath76 , where the 1-forms @xmath77 in @xmath2 , are given by @xmath78 these two 1-forms determine a codistribution integrable in the sense of frobenius @xcite , since there exist a set of four 1-forms @xmath79 such that @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "for example , we can take @xmath82 in order to satisfy the integrability condition .",
    "thus , there will exist ( locally ) functions @xmath83 such that @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "the subvarieties solution of the pfaffian system @xmath76   are defined by the equations @xmath86 , where @xmath87 are constants , @xmath85 .",
    "more specifically , in the actual examples , the system ( [ syst_first_ints ] ) takes the form of a non - autonomous first order system of linear differential equations @xmath88 or , written in matrix form , @xmath89 where @xmath90 the previous functions @xmath91 can be identified with the initial conditions of the solution of ( [ matr_equation ] ) .",
    "in fact , such a solution can be expressed as @xmath92 , where @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 is a @xmath96-valued curve ( @xmath97-valued curve if @xmath98 for all @xmath99 ) , solution of the right - invariant matrix system ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath100 then , @xmath101 gives the desired functions : with a slight abuse of notation , we have @xmath102 where we have used that @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",

    "now , we impose that the 1-forms ( [ one_forms_first_ints ] ) generate the kernel of the bivector in @xmath2 @xmath107 the resulting bivectors will clearly have rank two",
    ". moreover , they are poisson , according to the following result    consider in @xmath2 a bivector of type ( [ bivector_x4 ] ) , such that @xmath108 , @xmath109 , where @xmath110 , @xmath111 are given by ( [ one_forms_first_ints ] ) .",

    "we will treat in this section analogous questions to that of the previous section , but now in the euclidean space @xmath1 , with coordinates @xmath132 .",
    "the motivation is that typically , the reduced orbit spaces for the non - holonomic problems of interest , are semialgebraic varieties of @xmath1 , essentially determined by the zero level set of a function @xmath133 , quadratic in its arguments , which are moreover subject to certain constraints .",

    "in this section we will show how the preceding results can be directly applied in the cases of reduced systems corresponding to specific examples of non - holonomic systems , i.e. , the rolling disk , the routh s sphere , the ball rolling on a surface of revolution and its special case of a ball rolling inside a cylinder .      for this example we will follow the treatment and use some of the results of @xcite , see details therein .",
    "this problem has been treated as well , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "consider a homogeneous disk , which rolls without slipping on a horizontal plane under the influence of a vertical gravitational field of strenght @xmath7 .",
    "the resulting non - holonomic system has two evident symmetry groups .",
    "one is the symmetry group @xmath174 consisting of translations in the horizontal plane and rotations about the vertical axis , and the second is the @xmath175 symmetry consisting of rotations about the principal axis perpendicular to the plane of the disk .",

    "the position of the moving disk is given by transforming the position of the reference disk by means of a translation @xmath178 ( e.g. , of the center of mass ) and a rotation @xmath179 .",

    "the explicit expression of these solutions is @xmath356    we will treat now the question of writting the vector field @xmath58 , given by ( [ red_vf_ball_cyl ] ) , as a hamiltonian vector field with respect to a poisson structure of rank two , with hamiltonian function @xmath209 .    we first observe that the reduced vector field @xmath58 is annihilated by the 1-forms @xmath357 and then , it is easy to apply theorem  [ propo_pois_x4 ] , to obtain the following results :    the bivector @xmath358 is a poisson bivector on @xmath2 of rank two such that @xmath359 . likewise , the bivector @xmath360 $ ] is a poisson bivector on @xmath2 of rank two such that @xmath361 .",
    "in addition , we have @xmath362 , where @xmath58 is given by ( [ red_vf_ball_cyl ] ) and @xmath209 by ( [ e_red_ball_cyl ] ) . [ prop_pois_1_cyl ]    now , the pfaff systems @xmath363  and @xmath364   can be easily integrated , giving non - trivial casimir functions of @xmath365 , and first integrals of @xmath58 :    we have @xmath366 , and @xmath367 , where @xmath368 , @xmath369 and @xmath370 . [ prop_cas_pois_1_cyl ]    as a consequence , we have that the reduced vector field @xmath58 has in principle four first integrals , namely , @xmath209 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath371 , but clearly , they form a functionally dependent set . however , for example , we have that @xmath372 is generically an independent set of first integrals , although in the equilibrium points one becomes dependent of the other two . in the falling motions , @xmath373 ,",
    "therefore @xmath374 and @xmath375 become proportional .",
    "incidentally , we also observe that @xmath376 and @xmath377 .",
    "in addition , the poisson bivectors @xmath374 , @xmath375 are compatible in the sense that their schouten  nijenhuis bracket vanishes , @xmath378=0 $ ] , which can be checked , e.g. , using the properties ( [ props_scho ] ) .",
    "thus we have the following result :    the pencil of bivectors @xmath379 consists of poisson bivectors of rank two such that @xmath380 for all @xmath381 . moreover , the functions @xmath105 , @xmath382 and @xmath383 are ( functionally dependent ) casimir functions of @xmath384 ( and therefore , first integrals of @xmath58 ) for all @xmath381 .",
    "[ prop_cas_pois_lambda_cyl ]    _ proof _    that the rank of @xmath384 , for all @xmath381 , is two , is obvious when one realizes that it does not contain terms on @xmath385 and therefore the rank must be an even number between zero and four .",
    "the other statements are a matter of computation using the above observations .",
    "we have shown the form of certain poisson structures of rank two with respect to which certain reduced problems of non - holonomic mechanics become hamiltonian .",
    "we have shown that in @xmath2 and @xmath1 , from an algebraic point of view , these poisson structures are defined , up to a factor function , by the choice of the kernel of bivectors on these spaces to be generated by 1-forms of a specific type .",
    "such 1-forms define integrable codistributions in the sense of frobenius , and are chosen in order to accommodate and generalize the systems of first order non - autonomous differential equations which appear after reduction in certain non - holonomic mechanical systems , whose solutions are related to first integrals of such reduced systems .",
    "we have applied the theory to the cases of the rolling disk , the routh s sphere , and the ball rolling on a surface of revolution , explicitly recovering as a particular case some results of @xcite .",
    "thus , we have shown that the framework suggested by borisov , mamaev and kilin @xcite can be improved along the lines discussed , namely , that those reduced systems need no rescaling to become hamiltonian with respect to a poisson structure of rank two , and that the domain of definition of the poisson structures introduced therein can be extended , including even the set of singular equilibria of the reduced systems .",
    "a natural question is whether a similar approach could be used in other non - holonomic systems , maybe of higher dimension .",
    "however , there are more fundamental points still to be better understood .",
    "for example , to what extent the mentioned poisson structures can be useful to investigate the intimate nature of these and maybe other non - holonomic systems , for example in order to characterize their integrability properties @xcite ; see also the recent work @xcite .",
    "another question could be to clarify the origin of the system of differential equations giving the conservation laws for the mentioned reduced non - holonomic systems , see also @xcite and references therein .",
