    "multifractal sets and objects form the supporting structure of nonlinear phenomena , prime examples being strange attractors of chaotic dynamical systems @xcite regions of high vorticity in fully developed turbulence @xcite and fractal growth patterns @xcite .",
    "multifractal analysis has also been applied in a variety of other fields , such as , to describe the morphologic and hydrologic characteristics of river basins @xcite and to analyse the velocities of solar wind plasma in the inner heliosphere @xcite . in the case of chaotic dynamical systems ,",
    "their long time evolution takes place in a subset of the phase space called _ strange attractors _ , which are characterised by a spectrum of generalised dimensions @xmath1 @xcite and the associated singularity spectrum @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 spectrum provides a mathematically precise and naturally intuitive description of the multifractal measure in terms of inter woven sets with singularity strength @xmath4 , whose fractal dimension is @xmath0 .    for simple chaotic systems , such as one dimensional maps",
    ", @xmath0 spectrum can be determined analytically . to evaluate the @xmath0 spectrum from the time series , there are basically two methods . in the conventional method ,",
    "one first computes the @xmath1 spectrum from the time series and use the fact that the transformation from @xmath1 to @xmath0 is a legendre transformation determined by the equations @xcite @xmath5\\ ] ]    @xmath6    however , such a procedure is generally considered to be very difficult when done subjectively , as it involves first smoothing the @xmath1 curve and then legendre transforming .",
    "moreover , the error bar from the smoothing procedure makes the estimation of @xmath0 more difficult and often , the complete spectrum can not be recovered .",
    "an alternative method has been proposed in the literature by chhabra and jensen [ cj ] @xcite for the evaluation of @xmath0 from a time series without resorting to the intermediate legendre transform . in this method @xmath0",
    "is computed directly from the slopes by plotting the normalised measures defined through probabilities as a function of logarithm of box size for different @xmath7 values .",
    "the method gives good results and is devoid of the difficulty of legendre transforming in the conventional method .",
    "but here one needs to use an optimal covering of the measure and the subjective evaluation of the slopes can give rise to error bar directly in the @xmath0 curve .",
    "both these methods generally compute only an incomplete @xmath0 spectrum ( usually the top region ) and the problem becomes worse for attractors of more than one dimension .",
    "here we propose an algorithmic approach to overcome these difficulties and compute the complete spectrum from the time series for any dimension .",
    "our scheme is based on the idea that the typical convex profile of the @xmath0 spectrum can be fitted by an analytic function involving a set of parameters .",
    "this function can be inverted using eqs .",
    "( [ e.1 ] ) and  ( [ e.2 ] ) to get a smooth @xmath1 curve , which can in turn be fitted to the @xmath1 spectrum computed from the time series . by changing the parameters ,",
    "the statistically best fit @xmath1 curve is chosen from which the final @xmath0 spectrum can be evaluated .",
    "it should be noted that we are not proposing any new method , but a new algorithmic approach to improve the existing methods .",
    "our approach has several new features .",
    "it avoids many of the sources of error in the conventional method such as smoothing the @xmath1 curve and using the polynomial fit to recover the complete @xmath0 curve .",
    "moreover , the whole procedure is made into an _ automated _ algorithmic scheme in the sense that once the time series is given , the scheme computes the @xmath1 and @xmath0 curves for the required embedding dimension without requiring any intermediate subjective analysis .",
    "though the scheme is illustrated here for the conventional method , it can in principle be applied for the cj method as well .",
    "the only difference is that the fit has to be performed directly on the @xmath0 spectrum computed from the time series rather than the @xmath1 spectrum .",
    "apart from the computation of the @xmath0 curve , another important outcome of our algorithmic approach is the result that any @xmath0 curve can , in general , be completely characterised with the help of four independant parameters including the conventional @xmath2 and @xmath3 . from a practical point of view",
    ", this presents us with more options for representing the changes in the multifractal character of a system . some preliminary results in this regard obtained from the analysis of a class of physiological time series",
    "is also included in the paper .",
    "our paper is organised as follows :",
    "the algorithmic scheme is discussed in detail in sec.ii .",
    "the scheme is then tested in sec.iii using the time series from logistic attractor at the period doubling accumulation point where , the @xmath0 curve is known theoretically .",
    "it is then applied to some other standard chaotic attractors in higher dimensions .",
    "sec.iv considers the application of the scheme to practical time series , where the effect of noise on the @xmath0 spectrum is also studied .",
    "discussions and conclusions are given in sec.v .",
    "the @xmath1 values , with error bar , of the strange attractor at the period doubling accumulation point of the logistic map calculated from the time series with @xmath8 data points are shown in the upper panel . to show the accuracy of fitting ,",

    "as the first step , the spectrum of generalised dimensions @xmath1 are computed from the time series using the delay embedding technique @xcite . for this , an embedded space of dimension @xmath9 is constructed from the scalar time series @xmath10 as @xmath11\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is a suitably chosen time delay .",
    "the generalised correlation sum @xmath13 is given by the relative number of data points within a distance @xmath14 from a particular ( @xmath15 ) data point , say @xmath16 , raised to the power of @xmath17 and averaged over @xmath18 randomly selected centres : @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of vectors .",
    "then the spectrum of dimensions are given by @xmath22    in practical considerations , @xmath1 is computed by taking the slope of @xmath23 versus @xmath24 over a region of @xmath14 where the slope is nearly a constant i.e. a scaling region . for large @xmath14",
    "( apart from the formal breakdown of the limit @xmath25 ) , the slope does not represent @xmath1 since the m - spheres may extend outside the attractor , an effect known as `` edge effect '' . for small @xmath14 ,",
    "the correlation sum is affected by counting statistics due to the finite length of the data stream .",
    "in general , the appropriate scaling region where both these effects are negligible is often chosen by subjective visual inspection .",
    "we have recently proposed an algorithmic scheme which non subjectively chooses an appropriate region @xcite .",
    "the scheme which was developed to compute @xmath26 , uses m - cubes instead of m - spheres and chooses only those centres where the m - cubes are inside the attractor region , thus avoiding the `` edge effect '' . for large @xmath14 ,",
    "the number of such centres decrease and by the condition that at least @xmath27 centres are used for the computation , a maximum value of @xmath14 , @xmath28 is obtained . to avoid the region dominated by counting statistics only results from @xmath29",
    "are taken into considerations where @xmath30 , which ensures that on the average at least ten data points are being considered .",
    "the above estimation of the scaling region @xmath31 is adequate for computation of @xmath26 and the results obtained matches with theoretical values @xcite .",
    "however , for the generalised correlation dimensions , there is an additional error which may occur for finite data sets . for large absolute values of @xmath7 , the average over the randomly chosen centres eq.([e.4 ] ) may be dominated by a few centres which have either large ( for @xmath32 ) or small ( for @xmath33 ) values of @xmath34 .",
    "this biases the result towards a few centres which may be due to statistical fluctuations .",
    "this effect is particularly strong when @xmath33 , where centres with statistically small values of @xmath34 are the main contributors to @xmath35 .",
    "this is overcome by demanding that at least @xmath36 of the centres have a value of @xmath37 greater than @xmath13 .",
    "this restricts the range of @xmath14 further and often a suitable range of @xmath14 is not available for small values of @xmath7 .",
    "we fit a straight line to @xmath38 versus @xmath24 for the range of @xmath14 that satisfy the above criteria and estimate @xmath1 from the slope of the best fit line . the standard error on the slope",

    "( [ e.1 ] ) and  ( [ e.2 ] ) leads to an incomplete @xmath0 spectrum ( see fig .  [",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the errors in the calculation of @xmath1 makes the legendre transforming numerically impractical because of reversal of slopes .",
    "the conventional method is to either smoothen the @xmath1 values or use a polynomial fit to recover the complete @xmath0 curve .",

    "finally , we would also like to stress the importance of computing the @xmath0 spectrum using an automated scheme , such as the one presented here . in the four examples of real world data that we have analysed above , the saturated @xmath26 values are approximately same , but the @xmath0 spectra are quite different .",
    "the subtle changes in the @xmath0 spectra can be better studied using the present scheme .",
    "this is because , the scheme provides an additional set of two independant parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 , apart from @xmath2 and @xmath3 which typically characterise the changes in the @xmath0 profile .",
    "the utility of these parameters can be seen from table  [ t.1 ] , which shows the result of a preliminary study made on some limited physiological time series .",
    "we have analysed four class of physiological data sets downloaded from the above mentioned websites .",
    "they are eeg and ecg signals from healthy human beings , eeg signal during epileptic seizure and ecg signals from patients with congestive heart failure .",
    "we have analysed five data streams for each class and table  [ t.1 ] shows the average values of the two parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 for each class along with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with error bar showing the range of variation .",
    "we find that the values of @xmath108 are significantly different for the healthy data and those with physiological disorder in both cases .",
    "thus , just like @xmath109 which is conventionally used to characterise the geometric complexity of a multifractal , the quantity @xmath108 may also be a potential candidate to quantify the inherent changes in the multifractal character of the system .",
    "ofcourse , these results are only preliminary and have to be confirmed using a much larger number of data sets and requires an extensive analysis .",
    "nevertheless , the initial results indicate that our scheme can be efficiently employed to quantify the changes in the multifractal character between various states of a complex system ( such as the black hole system ) or track changes in the @xmath0 spectrum arising out of various physiological disorder as reflected in the ecg or eeg time series , as shown here .",
    "we hope the scheme can be better utilised in this regard .",
    "computing the multifractal spectrum of a chaotic attractor from its time series is generally considered to be a difficult task .",
    "often , only a part of the @xmath0 spectrum can be recovered numerically from the @xmath1 curve due to various reasons such as , the errors in the computation of @xmath1 and the legendre transforming involved . here",
    "we show that the existing methods can be improved using a new algorithmic approach by which the complete @xmath0 spectrum can be evaluated from a time series .",
    "the scheme first assumes an analytical function for the @xmath0 curve , from which a functional fit for the computed @xmath1 values can be obtained by the inverse legendre transform .",
    "the best fit curve is then used to derive the complete @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "the scheme is illustrated using time series from standard low dimensional chaotic systems and then applied to a variety of practical data from real world .",
    "we have recently shown @xcite that the the @xmath0 gives information only upto two scales evenif the underlying multiplicative process involves more than two . as a consequence , the @xmath0 spectrum of a chaotic attractor can , in general , be mapped onto that of a two scale cantor set .",
    "this also provides an alternative method for computing the @xmath0 spectrum and to characterise a chaotic attractor in terms of the three independant parameters of a two scale cantor set .",
    "in contrast , an important aspect of the present scheme is that , an analytic function is proposed ( which is probably unique ) to fit all convex @xmath0 curves in general . since the whole process is automated and the analysis is done under identical conditions prescribed by the algorithmic scheme , the resulting parameters characterising the spectrum ( derived from a fitting function for @xmath0 ) give a better representation for comparison between data sets .",
    "this is especially important in the case of real world data since the changes in the same system , such as for example , due to some changes in the parameter , can be compared in a non - subjective manner .    in order to show this explicitely",
    ", the analysis of a few class of physiological data is also presented .",
    "we find that the subtle variations in the @xmath0 curve can be better characterised using our algorithmic scheme .",
    "though our results indicate that the parameters may also be useful from a diagnostic point of view , this requires a much more comprehensive analysis using large number of data sets for confirmation .",
    "this is currently under way and will be presented elsewhere ."

    "<S> moreover , some preliminary results indicating that the set of four independant parameters may be used as diagnostic measures is also included .    </S>",
    "<S> * it is now well established that multifractal sets and objects abound in nature . </S>",
    "<S> a characteristic feature of these objects is the self similarity since their formation is governed by subtle scaling laws . </S>",
    "<S> an important tool to analyse these sets is the @xmath0 spectrum which describes how the fractal dimensions of the interwoven sets with defnite singularity strength are distributed . in the recent issue of _ chaos </S>",
    "<S> _ , participating in the discussion `` is the normal heart rate chaotic ? '' </S>",
    "<S> , many authors @xcite stress the importance of multifractality in the study of heart rate variability and suggest that it can provide a new observational window into the complexity mechanism of heart rate control . </S>",
    "<S> the study also highlights the need for evaluating new nonlinear parameters for a better physiologcal investigation and for finding new clinical applications . </S>",
    "<S> here we present a novel automated scheme to compute the @xmath0 spectrum of a multifractal from its time series . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the scheme can be applied to synthetic as well as practical time series involving noise . </S>",
    "<S> it also provides us with an additional set of two independant parameters apart from the conventional @xmath2 and @xmath3 to characterise any general @xmath0 curve . </S>",
    "<S> the utility of these parameters from the point of view of diagnostic measures is also pursued by analysing a few class of physiological time series . * </S>"
