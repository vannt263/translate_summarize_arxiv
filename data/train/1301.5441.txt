    "the first confirmed extrasolar planets were found to orbit evolved stars @xcite and the last 5 years has seen a resurgence of interest in this topic due to new discoveries ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of complimentary theoretical analyses has focused on single - planet , single - star evolved systems @xcite or systems with a belt or disc of material @xcite .",
    "these investigations crucially establish physical and analytical frameworks from which to explore more complex systems in greater depth .",
    "just a few studies have considered multi - planet post - main - sequence ( ms ) evolution .",
    "@xcite performed long - term integrations of our solar system assuming a constant solar mass loss rate .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that multiple equal - mass planets on coplanar , circular orbits which are marginally stable on the ms can become destabilised during post - ms evolution , because of the expansion of the hill - stability limit due to mass loss .",
    "@xcite showed that even hill - stable pairs of planets can eventually become unstable , illustrating that instability occurs more readily than previously thought , and that planets do not need to be closely packed to become unstable many gyr later .",
    "@xcite considered the evolution of two planets in cataclysmic variable systems , but did not focus on planetary instability .",
    "although these initial studies have now broached the topic of planet - planet scattering amidst mass loss , the detailed nature of this instability has yet to be explored . here",
    ", we pursue this line of investigation .",
    "we consider a planetary system with two planets in a resonant or nonresonant configuration that is stable on the ms and is perturbed when mass loss takes place .",
    "we will show that the perturbation pushes the system into a chaotic regime through which instability manifests itself after the mass loss ceases .",
    "the consequences of this late time instability may include collisions within the system or escape from the system .",
    "we focus on the later possibility , due to its potential relevance to the purportedly vast free - floating planet population in the milky way @xcite , which is thought to outnumber the galactic population of bound planets .",
    "the existence of such substellar objects , known as free - floating or orphan planets ( e.g. @xcite ) , may help us understand the low - mass end of the initial mass function .",
    "the source of free - floating planets is unknown . @xcite",
    "considered the rate of ejections in planet - planet scattering in ms systems , and found that even in the most optimistic case , the rate is insufficient to generate the observed poputation .",
    "alternatively , @xcite illustrated how a free - floating planet passing a stellar system could trigger dynamical instability and incite planetary escape , leading to another free - floating planet .",
    "@xcite and @xcite considered similar mechanisms for stellar flybys and star - planet flybys in the galactic disc , respectively .",
    "these studies do not reproduce the required escape rate , and potentially suggest that the free - floating planet population is a relic of the initial formation process .",
    "the turbulent early - age birth environment of planets might represent the primary source , as well as the frequent and slow flybys characteristic of young clusters @xcite .",
    "our focus here , however , is on planetary escape in evolved systems , and on bounding the phase space in which this can occur .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present some analytic and numerical results for the orbital element evolution of planets under stellar mass loss without taking into account the mutual planetary interaction . in section 3",
    "we present results that show the distribution of chaos and order in a system consisting of two massive planets and a star with constant mass ; we discuss the resulting chaotic evolution and the destabilization of the system",
    ". in section 4 we present our results , which represent numerical simulations that combine both planetary interactions and stellar mass loss , and demonstrate the possible system destabilization and planetary escape .",
    "we present our main conclusions in section 5 .",
    "in the classical two body problem , the two bodies describe similar elliptic orbits around their center of mass when the motion is bounded .",
    "the motion is planar and the orbital elements of the two bodies ( or the orbital elements of the relative motion of one body around the other ) are constant . if , however , one of the bodies loses mass isotropically in all directions , then the evolution of the system is quite different .",
    "the orbital elements of the relative motion are no longer constant , and the evolution of the system depends on the mass loss function @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the sum of the masses of the two bodies . in this sense",
    ", the assumption of @xcite that mass loss by the star and mass gain by the planet are equivalent does not hold .",
    "a particular case , which we shall consider in this work , is a planetary system with a star and a planet with much smaller mass , where the star loses mass isotropically .",
    "the osculating elements of the relative motion are given by the differential equations @xcite : @xmath4 \\frac{de}{dt}=-(e+\\cos f)\\frac{\\dot m}{m } \\\\[0.2 cm ] \\frac{d\\omega}{dt}=-\\frac{\\sin f}{e}\\frac{\\dot m}{m } \\\\[0.2 cm ] \\frac{df}{dt}=\\frac{(g m)^{1/2}(1+e\\cos f)^2}{[a ( 1-e^2)]^{3/2 } } + \\frac{\\sin f}{e}\\frac{\\dot m}{m } ,    \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the semimajor axis of the relative motion , @xmath6 the eccentricity , @xmath7 the argument of pericenter and @xmath8 the true anomaly .",
    "one can readily check that the above equations admit the integral @xmath9 which in fact is the angular momentum integral .",
    "we set @xmath10 in the remainder of the paper .    in the following , we assume that the loss of the mass of the star is described by the eddington - jean s law @xmath11 where @xmath12 is , in general , a small positive constant .",
    "the exponent @xmath13 defines the particular law , e.g. for @xmath14 we get a linear variation of mass , @xmath15 , and for @xmath16 the exponential one , @xmath17 .",

    ", we considered a star and only one planet .",
    "if there are two , or more , planets , then the evolution of the osculating elements becomes more complicated , because the gravitational interaction between the planets affects in an important way the orbital evolution , as we shall see in the following sections . only in the very special case where",
    "the masses of the planets could be considered as negligible would the evolution of each planet be determined by the system ( [ diffoet ] ) or ( [ diffoenorm ] ) .",
    "it can be proved @xcite that for a slow variation of mass and small eccentricities , the action @xmath36 is an adiabatic invariant , which implies that @xmath37 thus , from the angular momentum integral ( [ integral ] ) , we find that the eccentricity @xmath6 remains constant . from the above",
    "we see that the secular variation of the semimajor axis is given by @xmath38 which implies that the semimajor axis increases monotonically , since the mass decreases . particularly in the case of linear mass loss , @xmath15",

    "the planets in these systems are far away enough from their parent star to remain unaffected by tidal effects . a potential fourth mechanism , albeit one which will be complex to model , is two - planet scattering where the planets are close enough to the star to be affected by both mass loss and tides .",
    "this represents a potentially relevant extension to this work given that at least one planet in the vast majority of currently observed 2-planet systems will likely be affected by tides during post - ms evolution . therefore understanding the fate of multi - planet systems crucially depends on effects such as the one we have modelled here .",

    "we have identified the regions of phase space where the coupling is strong , causing initially stable systems to remain stable during the mass loss but later exhibiting escape .",
    "the stellar mass loss may transfer the system from its initially stable region to a wide chaotic sea in the phase space , which is associated with the final stellar mass .",
    "in such a chaotic region escape of the lighter planet always occurs .",
    "although we find this evolutionary sequence to be robust to small changes in initial conditions , we find that the escape time is sensitive to these changes . however , it seems that chaotic evolution , which is detected by the maximal lcn during an integration interval up to @xmath231 ky , results in most cases to destabilization of the system in less than 100 my .",
    "the general phase space maps presented can be used to characterize a wide variety of real systems .    in the numerical simulations of our paper we used a constant rate of mass loss .",
    "however , we have obtained qualitatively similar results for an exponential rate of mass loss : fig .",
    "4 demonstrates excellent agreement between the constant mass loss model and the exponential model . also , we note that mass loss along the asymptotic giant branch closely resembles either constant or exponential mass loss .",
    "we find that the upper - mass end of potential planetary systems that will experience a white dwarf phase ( @xmath232 ) is likely to exhibit the chaotic evolutionary behaviour seen here .",
    "just as importantly , lower - mass planetary systems , such as the currently - observed bound multi - planet exoplanet population , will experience adiabatic planet - planet interactions during post - ms mass loss . claiming that the adiabatic approximation holds in these cases for the three - body problem is useful , and will simplify the analytics for future post - ms three - body studies .    ,",
