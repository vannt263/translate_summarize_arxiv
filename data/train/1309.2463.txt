    "one is the photon - photon fusion and the second is photoproduction ( photon fluctuation into hadronic or quark - antiquark components and its transformation into a simple final state ) .",
    "the competition between these two mechanisms was studied only for few cases .    for @xmath4 production only the photon - photon mechanism",
    "was discussed in the literature @xcite . in ref .",

    "measurements at rhic confirmed the size of the cross section @xcite at midrapidities , but were not able to distinguish between different models that predicted different behaviour at large ( unmeasured ) ( pseudo)rapidities . the large cross section for single @xmath0 production suggests that the cross section for double scattering process should be also rather large .",
    "the best example of a similar type of reaction is the production of @xmath6 final state in proton - proton collisions which was measured recently by the lhcb collaboration @xcite .",

    ", the cross section for the @xmath6 final state is of the same order of magnitude as the cross section for single @xmath7 pair production .",
    "the situation for exclusive @xmath0 production is somewhat similar . due to easier control of absorption effect",

    ", we wish to focuss on double @xmath0 production in ulraperipheral , ultrarelativistic heavy ion reactions .",
    "we wish to study differential single particle distributions for the @xmath0 mesons , as well as correlations between the @xmath8 mesons , also for the photon - photon component .",
    "a comparison to the results for photon - photon process will be done too , in order to understand how to identify the double photoproduction process .",
    "we intend to take into account the decay of @xmath0 mesons into charged pions , in order to take into account some experimental cuts of existing experiments .",
    "we shall discuss how to identify the double - scattering mechanism at the lhc .",
    "most of the previous analyses in the literature concentrated on production of pairs of mesons in photon - photon processes ( see fig . [",
    "fig : photon_photon ] ) . in the past",
    "we have studied both exclusive @xmath4 productions @xcite and recently exclusive production of @xmath9 pairs .        in the case of double @xmath0 production",
    "there are two mechanisms . at larger photon - photon energies",

    "we shall concentrate rather on larger photon - photon energies ( larger dimeson invariant masses ) .    in the case of double @xmath10 production",
    "there are also two distinct mechanisms . at low photon - photon energies a box mechanism dominates , and at larger energies",
    "the two - gluon exchange mechanism takes over .",
    "the elementary cross section for @xmath11 has been measured in the past @xcite for not too large energies .",

    "@xcite we have parametrized the measured cross section and used the resulting elementary cross section as the input for nuclear calculations .",
    "there are many potential mechanisms contributing to the bump .",
    "since the calculation of the corresponding cross sections is not always easy , we leave theoretical studies of the underlying dynamics for future studies . at somewhat larger photon - photon energies ( @xmath4 invariant masses in the case of nuclear collisions ) another mechanism ,",
    "which can be relatively well calculated , plays the dominant role , namely soft virtual ( quasi - real ) vector meson rescattering . the corresponding matrix element for not too large @xmath0 meson transverse momenta can be parametrized in the vdm - regge language @xcite . at large transverse momenta of the @xmath0 meson",
    ", two - gluon exchange should become important ( see a discussion of two - gluon exchange for @xmath13 production in ref .",

    "we shall discuss only the soft scattering mechanisms .",
    "the hard mechanism may be important at the lhc .",
    "it is interesting if the two mechanisms can be identified by imposing kinematical cuts , or by looking at special observables .",
    "the nuclear cross section for the photon - photon mechanism is calculated in the impact parameter space as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 this can be written equivalently as : @xmath16 four - momenta of @xmath0 mesons in the @xmath17 center of mass frame can be written as : @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 the rapidity of each of the @xmath0 mesons ( @xmath22 = 1 , 2 ) can be calculated as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is related to @xmath0 meson transverse momentum .",

    "finally the following three - dimensional maps ( grids ) are prepared separately for the low - energy bump and vdm - regge components : @xmath40 the maps ( grids ) are used then to calculate distributions of pions from the decays of @xmath0 mesons produced in the photon - photon fusion .      the cross section for single vector meson production ,",
    "differential in impact factor and vector - meson rapidity , reads : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 . here",
    "the flux factor of equivalent photons , @xmath44 , is in principle a function of heavy ion - heavy ion impact parameter @xmath45 and not of photon - nucleus impact parameter as is often done in the literature .",
    "the effective impact factor can be formally written as the convolution of real photon flux in one of the nuclei and effective strength for interaction of the photon with the second nucleus @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 , i.e. , it is assumed that the collision occurs when the photon hits the nucleus . for the photon flux in the second nucleus one needs to replace 1 @xmath49 2 ( and 2 @xmath49 1 ) .",
    "in general one can write : @xmath50 the second factor includes the @xmath51-dependence for the @xmath52 subprocess which is due to coherent @xmath53 dipole rescattering off a nucleus .",

    "the imaginary part of the amplitude for the @xmath52 process can be written as @xcite : @xmath61 in the equation above , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are quark and antiquark helicities .",
    "helicity conservation at high energy rescattering of the dipole in the nucleus is explicitly assumed .",
    "the variable @xmath8 is the transverse size of the quark - antiquark dipole , and @xmath24 denotes the longitudinal momentum fraction carried by quark .",
    "the longitudinal momentum fraction carried by antiquark is then @xmath64 . using explicit formulae for photon and vector meson wave functions , the generic formula ( [ general_amplitude_gammaa_va ] )",
    "can be written in a convenient way ( for calculation see @xcite ) .",
    "the dipole - nucleus cross section can then be expressed in the glauber - gribov picture in terms of the nuclear thickness @xmath65 , as seen be the @xmath53 dipole in its way through the nucleus , and the dipole - proton @xmath66 cross section as ( see e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath67 this simple formula allows for an easy and convenient way to include rather complex multiple scattering of the quark - antiquark dipole in the nucleus .",
    "several parametrizations of the dipole - nucleon cross section have been proposed in the literature .",

    "<S> we calculate , for the first time , differential distributions for double @xmath0 meson production in exclusive ultraperipheral , ultrarelativistic collisions via a double scattering mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are done in impact parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section for @xmath1 is parametrized based on an existing calculation . </S>",
    "<S> smearing of @xmath0 masses is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the results of our calculations are compared at the rhic energy to the contribution of the two - photon mechanism discussed previously in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section for the double scattering mechanism is found to be an order of magnitude larger at @xmath2 2 gev and more than two orders of magnitude at @xmath3 3 gev , than that for the photon - photon mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the two - photon mechanism the double scattering mechanism populates somewhat larger @xmath4 invariant masses and larger rapidity distances between the two @xmath0 mesons and gives a significant contribution to the @xmath5 reaction . </S>",
    "<S> some observables related to charged pions are presented too . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the results of our calculation with the star collaboration results on four charged pion production . </S>",
    "<S> while the shape in invariant mass of the four - pion system is very similar to the measured one , the predicted cross section constitutes only 20 % of the measured one . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss a possibility of identifying the double scattering mechanism at the lhc . </S>"
