    "an elementary reaction is one for which no reaction intermediates have been detected or need to be postulated in order to describe the chemical reaction on a molecular scale .",
    "it follows that the reaction stoichiometry is sufficient to define the molecularity of the molecules involved in the reaction .",

    "one can define the topology of the resulting _ hypergraph _ using a generalized incidence matrix , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is always singular and typically @xmath4 for large biochemical networks .",
    "each row in this _ stoichiometric matrix _ represents a particular molecule , e.g. , glucose , whilst each column represents a reversible biochemical reaction .",

    "typically stoichiometric coefficients are integers reflecting the whole number molecularity for a molecule consumed or produced in a reaction .",
    "each column of a stoichiometric matrix contains at least one negative coefficient and one positive coefficient , reflecting either the chemical conversion of one molecule to another , or in multi - compartmental models , the transport of a molecule from one compartment to another , i.e. , a transport reaction may consume one molecule in a reactant compartment and produces one molecule in a different product compartment , even if the molecule is physically identical .",
    "we assume that each column of @xmath3 corresponds to one _ mass conserving _ chemical reaction .",
    "a necessary , but insufficient condition for mass balancing is that each column of @xmath3 must have at least one positive coefficient and at least one negative coefficient .",

    "we say that a chemical reaction is @xmath14 when the corresponding column of @xmath3 contains three non - negative coefficients , @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "there may be more than one negative ( positive ) coefficient in a column when a reaction involves more than one substrate ( product ) . in reaction networks with _ composite _ reactions , nonzero stoichiometric coefficients are typically not of magnitude one . however , even the most complicated composite reaction can be decomposed into linear and bilinear reactions .",
    "each row of @xmath3 contains at least one positive coefficient and at least one negative coefficient , reflecting the requirement for at least one reaction to produce and at least one reaction to consume each molecule . a stoichiometric matrix for a chemical reaction network is said to be _ consistent _ if each molecule can be assigned a single positive molecular mass , without violating mass conservation , and _ inconsistent _ otherwise @xcite .",

    "however , we shall assume that reaction kinetic parameters are isotopomer invariant so we need not be so strict .",
    "perhaps the simplest reaction kinetic assumption is that a unidirectional reaction rate is proportional to the product of the concentrations of each substrate consumed @xcite .",

    "the sufficient conditions for existence of a non - equilibrium steady state are easily tested numerically for arbitrary large chemical networks @xcite . as described in an elegant paper by @xcite the stoichiometric consistency of a metabolic network",
    "can be proved or disproved by attempting the linear optimization problem @xmath118 where @xmath119 denotes a vector of ones and @xmath120 is a stoichiometric matrix . if there exists an @xmath121 satisfying and , then @xmath3 is stoichiometrically consistent , otherwise a suitable solver will provide a certificate of infeasibility indicating that @xmath3 is inconsistent . alternatively ,",
    "if one has rigorously applied mass balancing for each chemical reaction whilst reconstructing a network @xcite , one will be able to assign a positive molecular mass corresponding to each of the molecules in the reconstruction .",
    "this strictly positive molecular mass vector satisfies and , which is sufficient to conclude that the corresponding stoichiometric matrix is consistent .",
    "the only other condition for theorem [ thm : existencess ] to hold is that continuous kinetic rate laws be formulated in a manner such that the concentration of any molecule can never be negative @xcite . in this paper , we have framed theorem [ thm : existencess ] in terms of elementary reaction kinetics that satisfy concentration non - negativity if the elementary kinetic parameters are non - negative . however , one can envisage a more general version of theorem [ thm : existencess ] as there are many other continuous kinetic rate laws that satisfy concentration non - negativity @xcite .",
    "any continuous kinetic rate law , where the rate of a unidirectional reaction is non - negative and zero if and only if any of the concentrations of the molecules consumed in that reaction are zero @xcite , would form the conditions for a generalised version of theorem [ thm : existencess ] . in any case ,",
    "any phenomenological kinetic rate law can be derived from assumptions that allow simplification of a system of elementary chemical reactions @xcite . as such , phenomenological kinetic modeling has its foundation in mass action kinetics .",
    "it is 50 years since wei s axiom s on the existence of steady states for chemical reaction systems@xcite and almost 40 years since horn & jackson @xcite considered what they termed _ general mass action kinetics_. in horn & jackson s setting , elementary reaction rates are proportional to the abundance of the substrates involved in the reaction , each to the power of the absolute value of the corresponding stoichiometric coefficient .",
    "however , _ general mass action kinetics _ considers systems where kinetic parameters need not be thermodynamically feasible , stoichiometric coefficients need not be integers , and mass need not be conserved by each reaction . with regard to modeling chemical reaction networks , we agree that consideration of reactions with thermodynamically infeasible kinetic parameters does seem profitable for representing the perpetual forcing of a system , purely for modeling purposes .",
    "however , violation of mass conservation appears unnecessary , as a pair of thermodynamically infeasible kinetic parameters are sufficient to force a system away from equilibrium , and counterproductive , as the resulting system may not admit a non - equilibrium steady state .",
    "horn & jackson @xcite do realize that the conditions for wei s existence result are unmet when mass is not conserved .",
    "we conclude that , rather than _ general mass action kinetics , _ assuming _ mass conserved elementary kinetics _ is sufficient for modeling non - equilibrium steady states in arbitrary large biochemical networks , as one is then sure that at least one steady state does actually exist .",
    "similar conclusions hold for phenomenological kinetic modeling , .e.g .",
