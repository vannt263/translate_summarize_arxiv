    "traditionally , quantum computation has been studied in the circuit model  @xcite , where the quantum register which stores quantum information consists of many qubits , and a quantum gate operation is performed by directly accessing one or two qubits in the quantum register .",
    "another canonical model of quantum computation is the one - way model  @xcite ( or more general measurement - based models  @xcite ) , where the universal quantum computation is performed by adaptive local measurements on a highly entangled resource state .",
    "recently , a mixture of those two models , which is called the ancilla - driven quantum computation , was proposed in @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the quantum register is a set of many qubits like the circuit model , whereas a quantum gate operation is , like the one - way model , performed by adaptive local measurements : one or two register qubits are coupled to a single mobile ancilla , and the ancilla is measured after establishing the interaction between the ancilla and register qubit(s ) .",
    "the backaction of this measurement provides the desired gate operation , such as a single qubit rotation or an entangling @xmath0-qubit operation , on register qubit(s ) . in the ancilla - driven model ,",
    "the universal quantum computation is performed with only a single type of interaction ( @xmath1 or swap@xmath2 ) between the ancilla and register qubit(s ) .",
    "it is a great advantage for experiments , since in many experimental setups , implementing various different types of interactions at the same time is very difficult ( such as the solid - based quantum computation ) .",
    "furthermore , the roles of the register and the information carrier are clearly separated , and no direct action on the register is required .",
    "therefore , it is also useful for experimental systems where measurements destroy quantum states , such as photonic systems . in short ,",
    "this model is a natural theoretical model of the `` hybrid quantum computer '' where the flying ancilla mediates interactions between static qubits ( such as the chip - based quantum computation @xcite or the hybrid system of matter and optical elements @xcite .    in a future when a scalable quantum computer is realized ,",
    "the quantum computation should be done in the  cloud \" style , since only limited number of people would have enough money and technology to create and maintain quantum computers .",
    "blind quantum computation  @xcite ensures the privacy of the client in such a cloud quantum computing . in protocols of blind quantum computation , alice ,",
    "the client , does not have enough quantum technology . on the other hand , bob , the server ,",
    "has a fully - fledged quantum power .",
    "alice asks bob to perform her computation on his quantum computer in such a way that bob can not learn anything about her input , output , and algorithm .",
    "blind quantum computation was initially considered by using the circuit model  @xcite . however , in this case , alice needs a quantum memory .",
    "recent new ideas of blind quantum computation which use measurement - based models have succeeded to exempt alice from a quantum memory  @xcite . in terms of the computational power , measurement - based models do not offer any advantage over the circuit model , since the circuit model can be simulated by measurement - based models and vice versa .",
    "however , measurement - based models have provided new points of view for studying quantum computation , and in fact such new viewpoints have enabled plenty of successes which have never been done in the circuit model , such as the high - threshold fault - tolerancy  @xcite , clarifying roles of entanglement played in quantum computation  @xcite , and relations to condensed - matter physics  @xcite . therefore it is important to explore the possibility of blind quantum computation on other models than the circuit model and measurement - based models .",
    "we first define several notations for the basis and for the basic transformations as follows : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we conventionally use the notations @xmath7 and @xmath8 to denote the bases along @xmath9 and @xmath10 axes in the bloch sphere , respectively .",
    "measurement outcome is represented by @xmath11 , associated with @xmath12 .",
    "we denote the @xmath13th measurement outcome by @xmath14 .",
    "we review the ancilla - driven quantum computation ( adqc ) proposed in @xcite .",
    "adqc is performed with a @xmath15-qubit ancilla , only on which we can make measurements , and ( a single or a few ) @xmath0-qubit entangle operator(s ) @xmath16 . as in fig.[fig : adqc]-(a ) , @xmath16 can be decomposed into @xmath17 by the cartan decomposition @xcite , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are @xmath15-qubit local unitaries and @xmath20 is a @xmath0-qubit non - local unitary .",
    "fig.[fig : adqc]-(a ) can be rewritten to fig.[fig : adqc]-(b ) by applying @xmath21 to the prepared ancilla state @xmath22 and @xmath19 to the measurement basis @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath20 is described as @xmath23 by using non - symmetric parameters @xmath24 due to the weyl chamber @xcite .    for universal quantum computation , we should choose all the parameters appropriately .",
    "to this end , anders _",
    "_ in @xcite derive sufficient conditions for ( i ) unitarity , ( ii ) _ one - step _",
    "correctable branching , ( iii ) standardization and ( iv ) universality .",
    "especially , we will discuss about one - step correctable branching , which states that the generalized pauli correction according to the measurement outcome after `` one '' execution in adqc enables the kraus operator acting on the system deterministic . in order to fulfill these conditions",
    ", it is shown that the entangle operator @xmath16 must be locally equivalent to either swap@xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) or @xmath1 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "adqc of swap@xmath2 type can be considered as an extension of one - way quantum computation because the measurements are made on the system instead of on the ancilla if we exclude the swap and this case is exactly one - way quantum computation .",
    "so we can perform universal blind adqc of swap@xmath2 type as in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus only on universal blind adqc of @xmath1 type .",
    "requiring all the conditions ( i)-(iv ) is too strong for universal blind adqc of @xmath1 type , since adqc of @xmath1 type satisfying all the conditions can not be blind ( in the sense of @xcite ) as is shown in the following .",
    "the system kraus operator for @xmath16 is specified as @xmath28 and @xmath29 . as in @xcite , unitarity and one - step correctable branching",
    "require that the parameters for the ancilla satisfy @xmath30 and the kraus operator @xmath31 , where @xmath32 are integers that differ in the parity .",
    "these coefficients are rewritten as @xmath33 moreover , the parameter @xmath34 for @xmath20 and the parameters for the ancilla have the following relation : @xmath35 therefore , unitarity and one - step correctable branching imply that admissible parameters of the ancilla are classified into the following four cases .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + then , we have the kraus operators written as @xmath36 by choosing the prepared ancilla parameters @xmath37 be any value and @xmath38 and the measurement basis parameters @xmath39 .",
    "blind adqc of @xmath1 type is enabled by allowing the above kraus operators .",
    "for blind computation , it is sufficient that all the information client sends to server is uniformly random .",
    "this is for hiding the rotation of unitaries to server in the computation and we show a rough sketch to incorporate this idea into adqc .",
    "first , client chooses a prepared ancilla parameter @xmath37 randomly and client sends ancilla @xmath40 or @xmath41 with equal probabilities .",
    "then , server performs the kraus operator @xmath42 using this ancilla . at this time",
    ", the ancilla is @xmath43 as maximally mixed state .",
    "moreover , if we assume the input state @xmath44 , the output state is @xmath45 so this state contains no information about @xmath37 .",
    "after that , client sends a measurement basis parameter @xmath46 and server performs the kraus operator @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the total kraus operator is @xmath48 and the total rotation of the kraus operator is hiding to server because @xmath37 is hiding .",
    "based on this idea , we relax one - step correctable branching to _ multiple - step _ and derive a sufficient condition which can make adqc of @xmath1 type blind .",
    "_ multiple - step _ means that , in `` multiple '' executions in adqc , each kraus operator needs not to be deterministic but the whole kraus operator must be deterministic up to the correction .    for universal blind adqc of @xmath1 type ,",
    "two types of kraus operators are necessary .",
    "one type is an _ uncorrectable _ kraus operator which depends on an outcome of the measurement , such as @xmath49 , performed using a prepared ancilla parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the other is a _",
    "correctable _ kraus operator , such as @xmath50 up to pauli correction , performed with a measurement basis parameter @xmath46 . with respect to these kraus operators , we consider two conditions : _ l - hiding _ and _ g - hiding_. l - hiding requires that @xmath51 holds , where @xmath52 .",
    "g - hiding requires that a gate pattern which can perform both @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are any @xmath15-qubit unitaries and one kind of entangle operators is composable by using a unitary @xmath56 and a controlled - pauli that can be simulated . in l - hiding",
    ", we might use an _ assistant _ kraus operator , such as @xmath57 , for satisfying universality .",
    "if the two conditions are satisfied , we can perform universal quantum computation by tiling the gate pattern in g - hiding regularly as in fig.[fig : pattern ] .",
    "what unitaries the gate pattern performs depends on a parameter @xmath58 of each gate in l - hiding composing the gate pattern . when client decides a parameter @xmath58 , client sends a measurement basis parameter @xmath46 such that @xmath59 . by choosing a prepared ancilla parameter @xmath37",
    "randomly , @xmath46 also looks random to server .",
    "this process is performed similarly to the protocol in @xcite .",
    "we use the following protocol for the performing of each @xmath56 .    1 .",
    "client chooses a prepared ancilla parameter @xmath37 randomly and sends the ancilla to server .",
    "2 .   server performs @xmath60 with the given ancilla .",
    "server sends an outcome @xmath61 of the measurement in this simulation to client .",
    "client decides @xmath58 and calculates @xmath62 with a random bit @xmath63 then sends @xmath46 to server .",
    "server performs @xmath64 and sends an outcome @xmath65 of the measurement in this simulation to client .",
    "client inverts @xmath65 if @xmath66 .",
    "if we use an assistant kraus operator in the protocol , server performs the corresponding simulation in step 2 . in the above protocol , each ancilla state is maximally mixed and each @xmath46 looks random to server .",
    "therefore , the information leaked to server is only the upper bound on the size of the universal gate pattern , that is , the upper bounds on the input size and the depth of the computation .        in the rest of this section",
    ", we discuss relations between the compatibility of the two hiding conditions and universality . in the case",
    "the protocol uses only one kind of entangle operators ( e.g. , @xmath67 used in @xcite ) and no assistant kraus operator , l - hiding and g - hiding do not hold simultaneously . from l - hiding , it must hold that @xmath68 . by the similar discussion for universality in @xcite , @xmath69 must be @xmath70 or @xmath71 up to a global phase , where @xmath72 . therefore , any @xmath15-qubit unitary @xmath54 composed of @xmath56 is described as @xmath73 with the kernel @xmath74 which moves a quantum state only in some plane of the bloch sphere , parallel to the @xmath75-@xmath10 plane .",
    "if @xmath76 and @xmath77 are determined , @xmath54 becomes a unitary which moves a quantum state only in one plane of the bloch sphere so we can not perform any arbitrarily rotation @xmath53 in g - hiding .",
    "in the case the protocol uses an assistant kraus operator , the two hiding conditions can hold simultaneously even if one kind of entangle operators ( e.g. , @xmath67 ) is allowed to use .",
    "it is enough to show how to simulate it and the gate pattern .",
    "the performing in l - hiding and a controlled - pauli ( @xmath1 ) in g - hiding are shown in fig.[fig : single ] .",
    "the gate pattern in g - hiding is shown in fig.[fig : gp]-(a ) . in the case",
    "the protocol is allowed to use two kinds of entangle operators , the two hiding conditions can also hold simultaneously even if the protocol uses no assistnat kraus operator . to see that , the simulation in l - hiding is shown in fig.[fig : double ] and the gate pattern in g - hiding is shown in fig.[fig : gp]-(b ) . in summary , universal blind adqc of @xmath1 type is possible by considering _ 3-step _ correctable branching in the case one kind of entangle operators is allowed in the protocol and _ 2-step _ correctable branching in the case two kinds of entangle operators are allowed .",
    "in this paper , we considered the possibilities and limitations for universal blind computation in adqc .",
    "first , we proved that if we satisfy all the conditions for universal quantum computation in @xcite , we can not perform universal blind computation .",
    "therefore , we relaxed one condition and derived a sufficient condition for the blindness . finally , we provided ways of universal blind computation in adqc of @xmath1 type .",
    "secondly , our way of universal blind adqc needs less quantum requirements for client than the way in @xcite in the case of using quantum inputs . in our ways , client does not need to rotate input states with respect to z axis in the bloch sphere but only to apply @xmath10 . extending our way to one - way model",
    ", we can also consider a way which is also less quantum requirements in one - way model ."
