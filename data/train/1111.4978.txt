    "the collaborations cms  @xcite , atlas  @xcite and alice  @xcite have published inclusive charged particle transverse momentum distributions in @xmath1 interaction at center - of - mass energy @xmath3  gev .",
    "here @xmath5 , @xmath6  energy and momentum of observed particle , @xmath7  its transverse momentum , @xmath8  rapidity and @xmath9  pseudorapidity .",
    "multiplicity density with respect to transverse momentum in unit of rapidity @xmath10 or pseudorapidity @xmath11 .",
    "value of @xmath12 can be picked either as @xmath13 ( inelastic ) or as @xmath14 ( non single diffractive ) cross sections depending on various experimental methodologies .",
    "notations of atlas and alice therefore can be written as @xmath15 , notation of cms can be written as @xmath16 . ] .",
    "the atlas and alice compared their measurements to inclusive cross sections of @xmath0 interaction obtained by the ua1 collaboration  @xcite at the same energy @xmath3  gev .",
    "the ua1 data overlaid with the atlas , alice and cms data are shown in fig.1 . as an immediate consequence of fig.1 ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath1 inclusive cross sections at the same energy @xmath3  gev @xmath17\\bigg/\\left[\\frac{1}{2\\pi p_t}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2n_{ch}^{pp}}{\\mathrm{d}\\eta\\,\\mathrm{d}p_t}\\right]\\ ] ] is greater than unity , @xmath18 for the atlas and alice data and @xmath19 for the cms data .",
    "the shaded areas indicate the errors of the ratios .",
    "the dashed line shows the value of ratio @xmath20 , our prediction from the lcnm .",
    "the solid line at unity is shown for visibility . ]",
    "the atlas and alice state that the difference is bound to systematic uncertainties of the ua1 experiment .",
    "the cms did not compare their data on @xmath7 distribution with the ua1 data and made no comments .",
    "the pomeranchuk theorem states that total , elastic and differential elastic cross sections of @xmath1 and @xmath0 interactions are equal at asymptotic high energies .",
    "it is commonly believed that characteristics of multiple production such as , for example , invariant inclusive cross section @xmath21 are also equal for @xmath1 and @xmath0 interactions at high energies .",
    "so it is expected that at high energies there must be equality @xmath22 and experimentalists naturally try to explain the ratio @xmath23 by the ua1 uncertainties .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to argue that inclusive cross sections of @xmath0 interactions are higher than @xmath1 at the same energy .",
    "thus experimental data of the cms , atlas and alice do correspond to reality .",
    "our first argument is based on analysis of the cdf data on @xmath0 interactions at @xmath24  tev  @xcite together with the cms data on @xmath1 interactions at @xmath25  tev  @xcite .",
    "we calculated the ratio of @xmath26 to @xmath27 which is shown in fig.2 .",
    "the result is amazing ",
    "the ratio of inclusive cross sections equals unity with good accuracy .",
    "if we accept that @xmath28 at the same energy , these cross sections must be different as the energy increases by 400  gev .",
    "that is , @xmath27 at @xmath25  tev must be higher than @xmath26 at @xmath24  tev",
    ". therefore the ratio given in the lower panel of fig.2 must be systematically lower than unity .",
    "tev to cms  @xcite at @xmath25 .",
    "the shaded area indicates the errors of the ratio .",
    "the solid line at unity is shown for visibility . ]",
    "let us discuss some details of our analysis .",
    "since there are no measurements of @xmath0 cross sections ( total , inelastic or nsd ) at @xmath24  tev , we obtained the inclusive cross section @xmath27 from the cms data @xmath29  @xcite multiplied by @xmath30 .",
    "we used value @xmath31  mb which was estimated by the alice for @xmath25  tev  @xcite .",
    "( lower value @xmath32  mb which gives lower value of @xmath1 inclusive cross section was obtained in  @xcite . ) therefore the experimental ratio given in fig .",
    "2 presumably confirms our assumption that @xmath33 at the same energy .",
    "in this section we will argue that it is possible to explain the difference in inclusive spectra of @xmath1 and @xmath0 interactions .",
    "previously we have demonstrated the possibility of difference in multiplicity distributions in @xmath1 and @xmath0 scatterings  @xcite .",
    "it is almost impossible to prove this difference experimentally .",
    "but we can use this approach to analyze possible inequality in @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we are based on the low constituents number model ( lcnm )  @xcite .",
    "as it should be in any collision theory , the model contains three stages : preparation of initial state , interaction , and separation of reaction products .",
    "schematic illustration of hadrons interaction and multiple production in this model is given by phenomenological diagrams in fig.3 .     and @xmath1 scattering in the lcnm .",
    "solid lines correspond to valence quarks and antiquarks , wavy lines are gluons .",
    "color field string is shown as spiral .",
    "the initial state can be composed of either only valence quarks or valence quarks plus 1 or 2 gluons .",
    "the final state is different for @xmath1 and @xmath0  there is no three quark strings configuration in @xmath1 interaction . ]",
    "a key feature of the model is assumption that there are only few scatters ( constituents ) in initial state of each colliding hadrons ",
    "these are valence quarks ( antiquarks ) and only one gluon .",
    "this gluon appears with low probability which grows slowly as energy increases , @xmath0 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 total cross sections  @xcite . ] .",
    "interaction is carried out by gluon exchange which corresponds to low  nussinov two - gluon pomeron  @xcite . due to gluon exchange",
    "colorless hadrons gain color charge .",
    "separation of reaction products ( colored hadrons ) occurs after interaction .",
    "when the charges are separated by distance larger than the confinement radius , color electric field strings are produced .",
    "these strings break up to primary hadrons .",
    "formation of color field string and its breakup into primary hadrons corresponds to the interaction in the final state .",
    "it should be emphasized that because color objects are not emitted , the process of converting color charges to hadrons occurs with probability which equals to unity and does not affect interaction probability .",
    "therefore values of total cross sections for both @xmath1 and @xmath0 are defined only by one gluon exchange in the second stage and so they are the same .",
    "thus the pomeranchuk theorem is fulfilled in the proposed lcnm approach .",
    "we distinguish the following inelastic processes of hadrons production ( or they might be better defined as inelastic subprocesses in multiple hadron production ) in @xmath1 and @xmath0 interactions .",
    "_ hadrons production from decay of gluon string .",
    "_ gluon string is produced when objects carrying octet quantum numbers fly apart after interaction . in this case",
    "it is impossible to separate gluon from valence quarks .",
    "wavelength of the gluon is such , that it overlaps with the valence quarks .",
    "this subprocess gives constant contribution to total cross sections .",
    "this subprocess is the same for both @xmath1 and @xmath0 interactions ( fig.3 , first column ) .",
    "_ hadrons production from decay of two quark strings .",
    "_ quark strings are produced between quark and antiquark and between diquark and antidiquark in @xmath0 interaction and between quark and diquark in @xmath1 interaction .",
    "since gluon spectrum is @xmath36 ( @xmath37  gluon energy ) , contribution from the component with one gluon in the initial state grows as @xmath38 .",
    "this gluon is absorbed after the interaction by one of the quark strings , and it changes the string color charge",
    " `` recolor '' the string .",
    "this contribution is the same for both @xmath1 and @xmath0 interactions ( fig.3 , second column ) .",
    "the contribution from two gluons in the initial state grows as @xmath2 .",
    "both gluons are absorbed by quark strings `` recoloring '' them . in case of @xmath1 interaction the two gluons initial state",
    "can only give configuration with two quark strings in the final state ( fig.3 , third column ) .    _ hadrons production from decay of three quark strings .",
    "_ in case of @xmath0 interaction the two gluons initial state besides the configuration with two quark strings can lead to configuration with three quark strings ( fig.3 , fourth column ) .",
    "the quark strings are produced between each quark and each antiquark .",
    "since the contribution of this subprocesses grows as @xmath2 , it is quite essential at high energies and @xmath0 interactions .",
    "contribution from decameron is low and constant with energy  @xcite .",
    "the afs  @xcite and ua5  @xcite collaborations have not found this contribution at energy @xmath39  gev .",
    "moreover it will not be seen at higher energies . ] .",
    "we suppose that difference in inclusive cross sections in @xmath1 and @xmath0 interactions is governed by presence of three quark strings in @xmath0 . this subprocess gives contribution in multiplicity distribution @xmath40 in the region of high @xmath41 ( @xmath41 - number of charged particles ) . in this region",
    "the value of @xmath40 is about one order of magnitude smaller than in the maximum region and so it is hard to experimentally study it because of large uncertainties .",
    "therefore the difference in @xmath40 distributions in @xmath1 and @xmath0 interactions will be difficult to detect .",
    "one has to use another observable value , which is able to increase the difference between @xmath40 distributions in @xmath1 and @xmath0 scatterings .",
    "we propose to use @xmath42 as the required observable value .",
    "let us define inclusive cross section of one charged particle production in an event with @xmath41 charged particles  a topological inclusive cross section ( `` semi - inclusive '' cross section of koba , nielsen and olesen  @xcite ) @xmath43 where @xmath44  topological cross section of @xmath41 charged particles production .",
    "we consider here only non single diffractive events , so @xmath45 .",
    "we stress that ( [ 2 ] ) is normalized to @xmath46 , where @xmath41  number of particles in an event .    in what follows",
    "we are based on the ua5 collaboration data  @xcite on the inclusive cross sections in 9 multiplicity bins : @xmath47 , @xmath48 ,  , @xmath49 at energy @xmath3  gev .",
    "we define inclusive cross sections in bin ( @xmath50 ) @xmath51 which are normalized as follows @xmath52 here @xmath53  probability of @xmath41 charged particles production in a nsd event .",
    "since we belive that inclusive cross sections of @xmath1 and @xmath0 are different we write down relation  ( [ 4 ] ) separately for @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that single diffractive cross sections @xmath54 are the same for @xmath1 and @xmath0 interactions",
    ". therefore @xmath55 are also the same .    from ratio of @xmath1 to @xmath0 in ( [ 4 ] )",
    "we obtain the following relation @xmath56 value of @xmath57 does not depend on momentum of observed particle @xmath6 . besides",
    ", bin limits can be chosen arbitrary .",
    "therefore one of solutions of ( [ 5 ] ) ( perhaps , the only solution ) has the form @xmath58 ( if @xmath1 and @xmath0 interactions are the same , we obtain a trivial result . ) the relation for the inclusive pseudorapidity cross sections in bin @xmath59 is @xmath60    we calculated the values of @xmath61 from the ua5 data in each bin .",
    "the values of @xmath62 are calculated from multiplicity distribution @xmath63 , obtained in frame of lcnm  @xcite .",
    "then we obtained inclusive pseudorapidity cross section for @xmath1 interaction at @xmath3  gev . @xmath64 the values of the inclusive cross sections @xmath65 and @xmath66 are shown in fig.4 for whole multiplicity range ( a ) and for multiplicity from 62 to 70 ( b ) .",
    "in this multiplicity bin the difference in the inclusive cross sections is very large because of high values of @xmath41 .",
    "the points for @xmath0 were obtained from the ua5 data  @xcite , the points for @xmath1 were obtained from the calculations in the lcnm .",
    "( a ) inclusive cross section for all charged particles .",
    "( b ) inclusive cross section for charged multiplicity bin @xmath67 . ]",
    "factorization of inclusive cross sections results from the abramovsky  gribov",
    " kacheli ( agk cancellations ) theorem  @xcite .",
    "phenomenological factorization relations were proposed by hagedorn  @xcite and tsallis  @xcite .",
    "therefore we can write down separate formulas for @xmath1 and @xmath0 @xmath68    it is easy to obtain from the relations  ( [ 5 ] )  ( [ 9 ] ) that @xmath69 .",
    "one can obtain from  ( [ 9 ] ) the following ratio @xmath70 it should be noted that the relations  ( [ 9 ] ) , ( [ 10 ] ) must be fulfilled in region of soft physics where the agk theorem is valid .",
    "therefore the relation  ( [ 10 ] ) must be fulfilled for transverse momenta up to @xmath71  gev . as it can be seen in fig.4 ,",
    "the ratio of the inclusive cross sections is approximately equal to @xmath72 .",
    "we can write down more strictly @xmath4  @xcite . on basis of relation  ( [ 10 ] ) we can state that ratio of inclusive cross sections of @xmath0 to @xmath1 is equal to @xmath73 .",
    "this value is depicted in fig.1 by dashed line .",
    "we have shown that excess of @xmath0 inclusive cross section over @xmath1 inclusive cross section at the same energy is connected with hadrons production in three quarks string configuration in @xmath0 , which is absent in @xmath1 interaction .",
    "we have predicted this difference in our paper  @xcite before the data of the cms  @xcite , atlas  @xcite and alice  @xcite were published .",
    "it should be noted that difference in @xmath1 and @xmath0 increases with rising collision energy in our approach . ] .",
    "we emphasize that we have a physical picture which was , probably , confirmed by results of the experiments ua1 , cdf , cms , atlas and alice .",
    "we do not agree with the following statements of the alice and atlas .",
    "`` the excess of the ua1 data of about 20% at low @xmath7 is possibly due to the ua1 trigger condition , which suppresses events with very low multiplicity ''  @xcite . ``",
    "a shift in this direction is expected from the double - arm scintillator trigger requirement used to collect the ua1 data , which rejected events with low charged - particle multiplicities ''  @xcite .",
    "inclusive cross sections in our notations and in notations of the atlas and alice can be written as equality @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the number of events inside the selected kinematic range , @xmath76 is the total number of charged particles in the data sample .",
    "it follows from simple logic that increase of inclusive cross section in the left part of  ( [ 11 ] ) is possible if @xmath75 decreases , and that is the basis of the atlas and alice statements .",
    "however , it is very hard to accept that the ua1 collaboration have lost about 17% of their data in case of comparing with the atlas and alice and 21% in case of comparing with the cms .    in this case",
    "a serious discrepancy arises , which should be noticed by experimentalists .",
    "the hagedorn  tsallis factorization formula is generally accepted by experimentalists for describing of transverse momentum dependence of inclusive cross sections .",
    "let us just use it to data given in fig.1 without pointing out any theoretical considerations .",
    "since all data were taken at the same energy @xmath3  gev then all factors determining @xmath7 dependence cancel each other .",
    "therefore it follows from data given in fig.1 that @xmath77 . from the other side , direct measurement of the cms  @xcite and alice  @xcite gave @xmath78 .",
    "we want to stress that discovery of an additional inelastic process in @xmath0 interaction is very important by itself .",
    "if existence of this process is experimentally proved , it will greatly change theoretical concepts of high energy physics .",
    "it is also important for monte carlo event generators which use data on @xmath1 and @xmath0 simultaneously in tuning of parameters , what may produce incorrect results .",
