    "for a long time , the many difficulties to correctly predict quarkonium - production rates at hadron colliders have been attributed to non - perturbative effects associated with channels in which the heavy quark and antiquark are produced in a colour - octet state  @xcite . on the basis of leading - order ( lo ) ( @xmath6 ) calculations",
    ", it had been assumed that colour - singlet production channels give a small contribution at mid and large @xmath2 .",
    "the confusion most probably came from the fact that quantum - number conservation ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and colour ) prevents leading @xmath2 scaling at lo and , in glue - glue production , at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) ( @xmath10 ) . ] .",
    "thus , in contrast with the situation for many other observables , there is still a possibility of unexpectedly large ( colour - singlet ) contributions at large @xmath2 at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "in addition , two unexpected features of fragmentation approximations have recently been revealed : heavy - quark fragmentation only dominates over the other topologies at very high @xmath2 and gluon fragmentation may not dominate over double @xmath12-channel gluon exchanges .",
    "as a consequence , it seems that , when leading kinematic contributions are correctly accounted for , colour - singlet production channels will play a more important role if not the most than in past analyses in the explanation of quarkonium - production observables and this suggests in turn that colour - octet fragmentation contributions may be less important than had previously been thought .",
    "this became clear thanks to the several recent computations of qcd corrections to quarkonium hadroproduction processes .",
    "the nlo corrections to the inclusive yield of @xmath0 and @xmath1 were computed @xcite in the qcd - based approach of the colour - singlet ( cs ) model  ) expansion of the effective theory , non - relativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd )  @xcite . ]",
    "its polarisation was in turn computed @xcite at nlo .",
    "these computations were recently complemented @xcite by the addition of the real nnlo corrections thereafter referred to as nnlo@xmath13. it was then shown that there may be no need to incorporate colour - octet ( co ) transition ( higher-@xmath14 corrections of nrqcd ) to describe the hadroproduction of @xmath1 at the tevatron  @xcite . in the case of the @xmath0 and @xmath15  @xcite , the cs contributions are significantly enhanced and brought very near the experimental data of cdf although the large @xmath2 direct yield seems not to be fully accounted for in the case of the @xmath15 for instance . as regards the co channels for @xmath0 production , their nlo qcd corrections were recently computed in @xcite . it was seen that they minimally affect both the @xmath2 dependence and the normalisation of the partonic matrix elements at mid- and large-@xmath2 , thus also the value of the @xmath16}$ ] co long - distance matrix elements ( ldme ) fit to the data .",
    "similarly , the polarisation prediction are not modified and remains in disagreement with the latest cdf measurements  @xcite . for recent reviews ,",
    "the reader is guided to  @xcite along with some perspectives for the lhc @xcite and a recent discussion on those aforementioned qcd correction computations  @xcite .    beside the studies of inclusive production , efforts are being made to obtain improved theoretical predictions for complementary observables to the inclusive yield , such as hadroproduction of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( thereafter commonly named @xmath17 ) in association with a photon  @xcite .",
    "recently , the nlo corrections to the hadroproduction of @xmath18 in the cs channel were computed by li and wang in @xcite . as in the inclusive case ,",
    "nlo corrections are significant in the large @xmath2 region since new topologies appear with slower @xmath2 falloff ( see fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] ( c ) ) , in comparison to lo topologies fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] ( a ) and other nlo topologies as the loop corrections fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] ( b ) .    in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that some @xmath19 contributions to the inclusive yield coming from three - jet configurations , i.e. @xmath20 , such as those arising from gluon - fragmentation and `` high - energy enhanced '' ( or double @xmath12-channel gluon exchange ) channels are important and clearly dominate over the other contributions at mid and large @xmath2 . in the case which interests us here ,",
    "@xmath18 , those two channels appear at order @xmath3  see for instance fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] ( d ) and ( e , f) and are expected to dominate over the @xmath18 yield at mid and large @xmath2 .    in this work ,",
    "we therefore apply the same procedure as in @xcite to evaluate their contributions .",
    "first , we will check that the nlo computation of li and wang @xcite can indeed be reproduced by an evaluation of the real @xmath21 contributions ( @xmath18 + one light partons ) complemented by a cut - off on low invariant masses for any pairs of external light partons in the process .",
    "the procedure is explained in the next section .",
    "we will also check that the sensitivity of our computation on this cut - off dies away when @xmath2 grows and that the theoretical uncertainty attached to its choice is typically smaller than the ones attached to the choices of the renormalisation scale @xmath22 for @xmath23 , the factorisation scale @xmath24 for the ( collinear ) parton distribution functions ( pdf ) and the heavy - quark mass @xmath25 .",
    "having performed those checks , we will apply the same procedure for the evaluation of the contribution for @xmath18 + two light partons namely the real nnlo contributions to @xmath18 production arguing that they provide with a first reliable estimate of the complete nnlo contributions to @xmath18 production at large enough @xmath2 .",
    "as regards the polarisation , the quarkonia directly produced in association with a photon via those channels are mainly longitudinally polarised , as in the inclusive case .",
    "as we argued in @xcite , the nlo contributions to the inclusive yield can be approximated at large enough @xmath2 in a relatively simple and reliable manner by computing the @xmath26 contributions consisting in the production of a @xmath27 with 2 light partons ( denoted @xmath28 thereafter ) on which we apply a cut - off on low invariant masses for any light parton pairs in the process .",
    "computations of such cross sections can be done reliably using the automated generator of matrix elements madonia  @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea supporting this was twofold :    * first , at large enough @xmath2 , topologies with the leading @xmath2 behaviour will dominate and those are wholly included in this subset of @xmath26 contributions ( the production of a @xmath27 with 2 light partons ) ; * second , this subset accounts for a physical process at born level .",
    "its contribution is therefore finite except for soft and collinear divergences .",
    "the purpose of the cut - off is to avoid such divergences by imposing a lower bound on the invariant - mass of any light parton pairs ( @xmath29 ) . for the new channels ( with a leading @xmath2 scaling ) opening up at @xmath26 , the dependence on this cut gets smaller for large @xmath2 since no collinear or soft divergences can appear there . for other channels ,",
    "whose born contribution is at @xmath30 , the cut would produce logarithms of @xmath31 .",
    "those can be large .",
    "nevertheless , they can be factorised over their corresponding born contribution , which scales at most as @xmath32 .",
    "the sensitivity on @xmath33 is thus expected to vanish at large @xmath2 .",
    "this insensitivity to the cut and the good agreement between the nlo@xmath13 ( @xmath34 with a @xmath29 cut ) and the full nlo result is recalled in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlo_vs_nlo_star_inclusive ] for the case of the inclusive @xmath0 and @xmath35 production .",
    "the gray band illustrates the sensitivity to the invariant - mass cut @xmath33 between any pairs of light partons when it is varied from @xmath36 to @xmath37 and @xmath38 to @xmath39 . in both nlo and nlo@xmath13 computations ,",
    "the value of all parameters were set to the same values . for the @xmath0 , we have @xmath40 gev , @xmath41 gev@xmath42 , @xmath43 and br@xmath44 and , for the @xmath35 , @xmath45 gev , @xmath46 gev@xmath42 , @xmath47 and br@xmath48 .",
    "the parton distribution set used was cteq6_m  @xcite .",
    "the yield becomes insensitive to the value of @xmath33 as @xmath2 increases , and it reproduces very accurately the differential cross section at nlo accuracy , both for the @xmath0 and @xmath35 case .      in the more exclusive case @xmath49 , similar topologies are present with the same @xmath2 scaling and we also expect to reproduce accurately the yield at nlo accuracy ( @xmath50 ) computed in @xcite by computing the yield from the production of @xmath49 with one light parton with the invariant - mass cut @xmath33 between any pairs of light partons , also referred to as nlo@xmath13 .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "for instance , the differential cross section for @xmath18 at nlo accuracy from li and wang  @xcite is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlo_vs_nlo_star ] and is very well reproduced by the nlo@xmath13 computed for different values of @xmath33 . when @xmath2 grows , the latter becomes completely insensitive to the value chosen for @xmath33 .",
    "the same parameter values were used for fig .",
    "[ fig : nlo_vs_nlo_star ] as for fig .",
    "[ fig : nlo_vs_nlo_star_inclusive ] and @xmath51 was set to @xmath52 .",
    "this result is a clear and completely independent confirmation of the validity of the reasoning initially given in  @xcite that nlo qcd corrections to quarkonium - production processes whose lo shows a non - leading @xmath2 behaviour can be reliably computed at mid and large @xmath2 by considering only the real emission contributions accompanied with a kinematical cut . in turn",
    ", this reinforces our confidence that the impact of nnlo contributions can evaluated likewise by computing the nnlo@xmath13 contributions , as done in the following section .",
    "this also gives us confidence that much better monte carlo simulations of inclusive production at mid and large @xmath2 could be achieved using nlo@xmath13 and nnlo@xmath13 partonic matrix elements , which can be interfaced  @xcite with event - generators such as pythia  @xcite . in any case",
    ", they would give results much more reliable than simulations based on matrix elements for cs channels at lo only .",
    "among the contributions appearing at @xmath3 , we find the topologies of  fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] ( d ) ( gluon fragmentation ) and  fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] ( e , f ) ( `` high - energy enhanced '' or double @xmath12-channel gluon exchange ) , those exhibit new kinematical enhancements appearing in higher - order qcd corrections . in other words , those provide us with new mechanisms to produce a high-@xmath2 @xmath53 with a @xmath54 with a lower kinematic suppression , still via cs transitions .",
    "they are therefore expected to dominate the differential cross section at nnlo accuracy in the region of large transverse momentum .",
    "those are also entirely contained in the contributions to @xmath55 , namely the real @xmath56 corrections , and we can follow the procedure validated in the previous section , by `` simply '' adding one light partons in the final state .    the computation of @xmath57 at tree level is in principle systematic , but technically quite challenging : a dozen parton - level subprocesses contribute , most involving a few hundred feynman diagrams . as done in  @xcite , we follow the approach described in ref .",
    "@xcite , which allows the automatic generation of both the subprocesses and the corresponding scattering amplitudes .",

    "[ polarizationalphas4 ] along with the curves for the nlo@xmath13 .",
    "our predictions for the polarisation parameter @xmath75 for the nlo@xmath13 are in qualitative agreement with those of  @xcite , i.e. the @xmath0 s produced in association with a photon are dominantly longitudinal .",
    "we did not go further in the comparison since , for both numerical computations , 5% precision in @xmath75 could only be reached at a high cost of computing time and since the nnlo@xmath13 is anyhow larger .",
    "as regards the latter , it confirms the trends of the nlo@xmath81 ( and thus nlo ) results .",
    "this is not a surprise knowing the nnlo@xmath13 results for the inclusive yield , differing essentially in the replacement of the photon by a gluon .",
    "this replacement is indeed not expected to change results concerning the polarisations of the particles produced .",
    "first , let us stress that although the uncertainty associated with the choice of the cut @xmath33 is somewhat larger than at nlo@xmath13 , it is nevertheless smaller than the one attached to the mass , the renormalisation scale and the factorisation scale   has a negligible impact on the final results compared to the other theoretical uncertainties . ] .",
    "the latter dependence is expected : on the one hand , we miss the virtual part at low @xmath2 where it is sizable and where it is expected to reduce the renormalisation - scale dependence ; on the other hand , the contributions dominating at large @xmath2 are directly sensitive to the fourth power of @xmath23 . yet",
    ", the dependence is smaller than in the inclusive case  @xcite where five powers of @xmath23 are involved .",
    "second , we find that the subprocess @xmath82 dominates , providing with more than two thirds of the whole yield in the @xmath0 case .",
    "in addition , we have checked that this fraction is slightly increasing with @xmath2 and only weakly dependent on the value of the invariant mass cut - off of light partons @xmath33 , removing the collinear and infrared divergences of @xmath82 .",
    "another important observation is that the size of the yield from @xmath82 does not vary much when @xmath33 is changed from 2.25 to 9 gev@xmath83 in the @xmath0 case for instance .",
    "this indicates that those divergences are not after being cut artificially responsible for a large part of the nnlo@xmath13 yield .",
    "third , it is likely that the largest part of this contribution is not from gluon fragmentation topologies , but rather from double @xmath12-channel gluon exchange ones factorisation formalism .",
    "see  @xcite for a recent application to @xmath1 hadroproduction .",
    "] , keeping in mind that such a decomposition in terms of the corresponding feynman graphs is not gauge invariant .",
    "there are a couple of indications supporting this :    * such fragmentation contributions would be expected to provide transverse quarkonia if there were neither corrections due to the off - shellness of the fragmenting gluons nor possible spin - flip contributions when radiated gluon energies ( in @xmath17 rest frame ) are not small compared to the heavy - quark mass . while a depolarisation ( in the helicity frame ) is possible , it would be still far from the longitudinal polarisation computed here for @xmath17 produced via @xmath82 .",
    "* processes such as @xmath84 , which proceed uniquely via double @xmath12-channel gluon exchange , have the same @xmath2 dependence as the process @xmath82 and the difference in normalisation is naturally accounted for by colour factors and the smaller value of the quark pdf compared to the gluon one at low @xmath85 .",
    "another similarity with @xmath82 is that the polarisation of the yield from @xmath86 is strongly longitudinal , for @xmath2 larger than 5 gev , as observed for the full nnlo@xmath13 yield dominated by @xmath82 .",
    "the previous discussion can in fact be extended to the inclusive case studied in  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the results then obtained at nnlo@xmath13 appeared to be significantly higher than the ones using the fragmentation approximation .",
    "further , the polarisation of the yield from @xmath87 processes happened to become more and more longitudinal at large @xmath2 in contradiction with the expected polarisation from a fragmentation channel .",
    "this lets us think that , for both processes @xmath18 and @xmath88 at nnlo@xmath13 , the yield may mainly come from double @xmath12-gluon channel exchanges appearing for the first time at this order .",
    "a careful kinematical analysis of the yield from @xmath82 would certainly be helpful .",
    "yet , it would be highly computer - time demanding , especially to obtain a distribution would be even better .",
    "] of the relative momentum between the @xmath0 and its closest gluon precise enough to unequivocally attribute the most part of the yield to the double @xmath12-channel gluon exchange channels rather than to the fragmentation ones .",
    "indeed , it concerns the most complicated process with a couple of hundreds of diagrams .",
    "this work is left for a future analysis and would certainly be expediently done along with the one for the inclusive case .",
    "in order to detect the photon , we evidently have to impose that it possesses a finite transverse momentum for it not to go in the beam pipe and that it is isolated to avoid misidentifications with bremsstrahlung radiations .",
    "yet , isolation criteria highly depend on the detector potentialities .",
    "the determination of optimum values for @xmath89 and for an isolation criterion for the @xmath54 improving the signal over background ratio is beyond the scope of this theoretical analysis .",
    "we have therefore decided to apply minimal values for those constraints , which would be further increased after a full detector simulation .",
    "along the same lines , it is worth noting here that isolation cut for co mediated signal ( a priori suppressed , as discussed below ) can only be imposed in such simulation .",
    "indeed , such a cut requires a simulation of the hadronic activity following the discolouration of the co pairs as done e.g.  in @xcite .    at lo ,",
    "the @xmath2 requirement is trivially satisfied for a @xmath17 with a finite @xmath90 since @xmath91 is balancing @xmath90 . as discussed by li and",
    "wang  @xcite , this is not automatically the case at nlo and a minimum @xmath91 cut has to be applied and it affects the yield vs @xmath90 up to roughly three times the value of this cut .",
    "typically the cut @xmath92 gev applied here affects the yield up to @xmath93 gev .",
    "as regards the isolation cut , we excluded any events with partons ( @xmath94,@xmath95 ) within a cone @xmath96 from the photon  @xcite when the @xmath54 is emitted by the external quark . those are anyhow sub - dominant topologies of suppressed quark - gluon initiated contributions and could have safely been neglected . ] .",
    "as noted above , those are minimal cuts .    in our case",
    "an analysis of different @xmath91-cut values is less relevant than in  @xcite for two reasons : first , our computation can not be reliably extended to low @xmath2 and , second , the main contributions the",
    "double @xmath12-channel gluon exchange and gluon - fragmentation channels create a @xmath54 with a similar momentum as that of the @xmath17 ( see the graphs of fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] ( d ) & ( e ) ) .",
    "overall , such a kinematical cut insuring its detectability does not affect the nnlo@xmath13 yield for @xmath2 larger than 10 gev .    beside the problem of the photon detectability",
    ", we have to make sure that other processes will not contribute to the yield of @xmath18 . in the @xmath0 case",
    ", we expect the non - prompt background to be properly subtracted ( by vertex - displacement method for instance ) .",
    "however , in this case , the ratio `` non - prompt over prompt '' at very large @xmath2 is expected to be lower than in the inclusive case since the photon emission is required for both processes , whereas in the inclusive case the @xmath97 feed - down can proceed at a lower order in @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath98 feed - down will not be significant ( except in the region where the invariant mass of the pair @xmath18 is close to the mass of the @xmath98 ) since suppressed by @xmath99 and by the branching while having the same @xmath100 suppression than for the @xmath0 for similar topologies .",
    "as regards the feed - down of the radially excited states @xmath5 , they are readily accounted for by constant multiplicative factors to the cross section of the state fed in : @xmath101 for the @xmath71 into @xmath0 , @xmath102 for both the @xmath72 into @xmath35 and @xmath73 into @xmath72   and the respective branchings from which they are derived . ] .",
    "now , let us discuss the possible colour - octet contributions , ignoring first the modifications , induced by the qcd corrections to co and cs contributions , of the co ldme extracted from the tevatron data .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , a quick comparison with the results obtained in  @xcite shows that the nlo cs and the lo co yields are of the same order at the lhc , with roughly the same @xmath2 dependence .    yet , contrary to what is claimed in  @xcite , higher - qcd corrections are expected to impact more on the co partonic matrix elements in @xmath18 than in the inclusive case  @xcite , for which nlo corrections seem unimportant at large @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , the difference between the two cases lies in the fact that in @xmath18 @xmath103 topologies , such as fragmentation ones , are not opened at the order @xmath104 as studied in  @xcite ( only one initiated by quark , and thus sub - dominant at low @xmath85 , @xmath105}$ ] , with a quark in the @xmath12-channel shows a @xmath103 scaling ) .    in the light of the nnlo@xmath13 results ,",
    "we know that when the real @xmath106 contributions are taken into account , the cs contributions will be increased by about one order of magnitude compared to the cs at nlo .",
    "to be sure that cs contributions are then dominant over co ones at higher orders , we have to check that fragmentation contributions from co opening at @xmath107 are small .",
    "this is indeed the case since they are mediated by either @xmath108}$ ] or @xmath109}$ ] @xmath110 co states and their corresponding ldmes are know to be severely constrained when higher - qcd corrections are taken into account for the analysis of the inclusive data at low- and mid-@xmath2 at the tevatron  @xcite , at various fixed - target experiments  @xcite and more recently at the @xmath97 factories  @xcite .",
    "finally , a further suppression is expected from the increase of the cs yield from nlo and nnlo@xmath13 contributions  @xcite . using an upper conservative value of the ldme combination @xmath111}]|0\\rangle + \\frac{k}{m_c^2}\\langle 0| { \\cal o}^{j/\\psi}[^3p_0^{[8]}]|0\\rangle = 1 \\times 10^{-2}$ ] gev@xmath42 ( @xmath112 ) , we analysed the two extreme cases ( @xmath113}]|0\\rangle=0 $ ] ( case i ) and @xmath114}]|0\\rangle=0 $ ] ( case ii ) ) to evaluate those co @xmath107 contributions via @xmath115 using the same parameter values as the central nlo curve and @xmath116 . at @xmath117 gev ,",
    "the case i gives a contribution about 5 times smaller than the central @xmath107 ( nlo ) cs values while the case ii is further below co ldme than the inclusive production . ] by another factor of 5 . at @xmath118 gev ,",
    "case i is less than a factor of 2 larger than the central nlo values , thus still clearly below the nnlo@xmath13 yield , while case ii is still a bit suppressed and comparable to the central nlo values .",
    "a dedicated analysis including a global fit of the @xmath110 co ldmes and taking into account dglap radiation of the fragmenting gluon is beyond the scope of this work but would confirm that @xmath107 co corrections to @xmath18 matter only at large @xmath2 and are most likely not large enough to challenge the dominance of cs contributions to this process .",
    "this dominance is expected since the photon has to be emitted by quarks .",
    "if the hard scattering part is @xmath119 , the photon can only be emitted by the heavy quarks with topologies similar to cs channels . at @xmath120 , the gluon - fusion co channels do not scale like @xmath103 .",
    "one has to go to @xmath21 to have the first gluon fragmentation channels initiated by gluon fusion . in this case , as discussed above , the gluon fragments into a photon and a co @xmath110 ( whose ldmes are severely constrained ) .",
    "exactly balance @xmath90 in order to select the lo csm , aiming at the extraction of the gluon distributions for instance , one would have to refine the analysis to take into account nnlo@xmath13 corrections in the cs channels and the co yield  @xcite which would then be dominated by @xmath121}+\\gamma$ ] via @xmath108}$ ] or @xmath122}$ ] if the @xmath110 co channels are not too much suppressed . ]",
    "last but not least , contrary to the double @xmath12-channel gluon exchanges dominating the cs yield , the latter fragmentation co topologies will systematically produce nearly collinear @xmath54 and hadrons from the discolouration of the co state .",
    "those events are therefore likely to be rejected by experimental photon - isolation cuts .    finally , while contributions from @xmath123-channel cut to @xmath0 production could appear in the low @xmath2 region as in the inclusive case  @xcite ( the final state gluon of the @xmath124 being simply replaced by a photon ) , in the large @xmath2 region , the colour - transfer - enhancement mechanism discussed in  @xcite is not expected to matter for the present process . in the inclusive case , @xmath125 may account for a significant part of the yield at very large @xmath2 .",
    "this indicates that topologies for which colour transfer could occur are not much suppressed and those could impact on the inclusive yield . in the present case , we have checked that the contribution to @xmath126 from the partonic process @xmath127 is sub - dominant and found that it is one order of magnitude smaller than the process from @xmath128 with the same @xmath2 dependence between 20 and 50 gev .",
    "it is therefore quite unlikely that colour transfers , acting on topologies with at least 3 heavy quarks , be visible in @xmath126 yields .",
    "in conclusion , we have computed the real next - to - next - to - leading order qcd contributions to the hadroproduction of a @xmath126 and @xmath129 via colour singlet transitions along the same lines as  @xcite for the inclusive case and argued that it provided a first reliable evaluation of the corresponding yield at nnlo accuracy .    indeed , prior to that",
    ", we have shown that the full nlo evaluation of li and wang  @xcite is very accurately reproduced for @xmath130 gev by the sole evaluation of the real emission contributions up to order @xmath50 , namely the nlo@xmath13 . in the inclusive case  @xcite , a similar observation was made and motivated the study of the nnlo@xmath13 contributions to evaluate the yield at nnlo accuracy .",
    "we have thus reach a completely independent , but similar , conclusion for the production of a quarkonium in association with a photon .",
    "a priori , integrating the amplitudes for such real emission contributions leads to divergences in some phase - space regions . those can be avoided by imposing a minimal invariant mass between the external light partons , while in a complete calculation",
    "those divergences are canceled by the virtual corrections . yet , at nlo , the latter scale as @xmath32 and , at nnlo , as @xmath131 , hence are suppressed compared to respectively the real nlo part scaling as @xmath131 and the real nnlo part scaling as @xmath103 .",
    "this explains why we can neglect the virtual corrections at mid and large @xmath2 and use a cut - off on which the results become insensitive when @xmath2 grows , and also why the sole nlo@xmath13 reproduces the full nlo accurately .",
    "we have also shown that the differential cross section in @xmath2 at nnlo@xmath13 is one order of magnitude larger than at nlo for large @xmath2 as expected from their @xmath2 scaling. we have also identified the process responsible for the most part of it , i.e. @xmath132 . although , the distinction between the gluon - fragmentation and the double @xmath12-channel gluon exchange graphs can not be carried out in gauge invariant way , we provided some hints that the second type of topology is dominating , similar to the inclusive case  @xcite .",
    "one of this hint is the polarisation of the quarkonia produced in association with a photon .",
    "indeed , we have computed the polarisation parameter @xmath75 of the nnlo@xmath13 yield which is negative , indicating a longitudinally polarised yield .",
    "this confirms the trend observed at nlo and hints at the dominance of double @xmath12-channel gluon exchange contributions .",
    "when the nnlo@xmath13 contributions are incorporated in the cs yield , it becomes one order of magnitude larger than the potential co yield , which would mainly produce transversally polarised @xmath17 .",
    "the measurements of the cross section for the production of @xmath18 would directly measure the size of the cs without being sensitive to the non - perturbative co parameters .",
    "this is a complementary case to the study of @xmath133 and @xmath134 as discussed in  @xcite .    similarly to the analysis of the inclusive case  @xcite",
    ", this analysis can not be extended to too low @xmath2 , where the approximations on which it is based no longer hold .",
    "one way to improve the predictions could be achieved by merging the matrix elements with parton showers using one of the approaches available in the literature  @xcite , or by performing an analytic resummation  @xcite .",
    "finally , the results presented here strongly support the procedure used for the very first evaluation of the inclusive yield at nnlo accuracy  @xcite and which showed an agreement with the tevatron measurements .",
    "this in turn confirms that much better monte carlo simulations than the ones based on matrix elements for cs channels at lo only are now possible at mid and large @xmath2 .",
    "this could be achieved using nlo@xmath13 and nnlo@xmath13 partonic matrix elements generated by madonia  @xcite , for the process studied here @xmath135 , but also for the inclusive measurements to be performed at the lhc .",
