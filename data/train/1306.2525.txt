    "light fields having a cutoff in the photon statistics are known to exhibit nonclassical features .",
    "of particular interest are single photon emitters ( spes ) , whose emitted field consists of one photon in a properly defined mode volume . a single , laser - driven two - level atom was the first spe under study  @xcite .",
    "the first experimental demonstration of the quantum nature of light through the photon antibunching effect was realized with a low - density atomic beam  @xcite . in a related experiment",
    "a sub - poisson photon statistics was observed  @xcite .",
    "later on , photon antibunching has also been demonstrated with single trapped ions  @xcite .",
    "nowadays , artificial atoms , such as quantum dots in semiconductor micro - systems , are established spes , showing photon antibunching and sub - poisson photon statistics  @xcite .",
    "squeezed light was also predicted to occur in the resonance fluorescence of driven spes  @xcite . squeezing can also be realized and enhanced in the fluorescence of many atoms in different scenarios .",
    "they include the regular arrangement of the atoms  @xcite ; the detection in the forward direction with respect to the pump - beam  @xcite ; and the bistability in a strong driving field  @xcite .",
    "the latter two cases could be experimentally demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "recently it was shown , that the output field of a driven cavity , containing an atom , shows weak squeezing  @xcite .    a direct observation of squeezing from a single driven spe",
    "could neither be demonstrated in atoms nor in quantum dots ; hence , this is an issue of fundamental interest .",
    "the standard method for detecting squeezing is balanced homodyne detection . in this case , the observable effects in the resonance fluorescence are tiny due to the small collection efficiency of the light field . based on homodyne correlation measurements , efficient measurement techniques were proposed  @xcite , which are not limited by the small collection efficiency . the feasibility of such techniques has been demonstrated recently , in resonance fluorescence of a single trapped ion  @xcite .",
    "recently we have shown that squeezed light in the fluorescence of an atom can be optimized  @xcite .",
    "the maximal possible squeezing depends on the excitation of the emitter .",
    "it is achieved when the electronic subsystem of the emitter is in a pure quantum state .",
    "specifically , we found , that the maximal attainable squeezing is twice as large as for an atom in free space .",
    "this indicates the unfavorable situation of an atom which only couples to the vacuum field modes .",
    "we presented a purification scheme , solely based on a second coupling of the atom to a cavity field , which yields over 99% purity and 94% of the maximal possible squeezing .",
    "the fluorescence light must be observed out the side of the cavity , so that the latter acts as a passive environment .",
    "we predicted the squeezing to be substantially less fragile against radiationless dephasing .    in the present paper",
    "we study the fluorescence of general spes and investigate the possible squeezing and its limitations .",
    "we derive an analytical approximation of the purification procedure , which allows us to interpret the underlying physics .",
    "furthermore , based on the approximation we analyze different environmental effects , as they occur in a quantum dot in a semiconductor microcavity .",
    "the results indicate , that squeezing persists even under certain perturbations , so that quantum dots in semiconductor microcavities may be a promising source of squeezed light , to be used in integrated optical systems .",

    "[ fig.a22incx ] we compare @xmath26 for different values of @xmath137 inside and outside the cavity .",

    "the squeezing in resonance fluorescence is diminished by the small collection efficiency , which is not the case for standard sources . on the other hand ,",
    "our observation scheme is not sensitive to the efficiency , whereas the balanced homodyne detection in the standard case is .",
