    "it s well known that navier - stokes equations give us the behaviour of fluids @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the most general equations of a viscous compressible fluid is given by the nonlinear partial differential equations @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the density of the fluid , @xmath2 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath3 is a second viscosity coefficient and @xmath4 is an external force . in equation ( [ eq compressible ns ] ) , the velocity @xmath5 of a fluid particle is a vectorial function @xmath6 , and pressure @xmath7 is a scalar function @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the fluid is incompressible if @xmath1 is constant and , as a mass conservation law consequence , the flow is free - divergence , i.e. @xmath11 .",
    "then , using einstein notation , the navier - stokes equations ( [ eq compressible ns ] ) for each velocity component are @xmath12 where we have taken @xmath13 and @xmath14 for simplicity . an acceptable solution for ( [ eq incompressible ns])-([eq free - divergence ] ) are that functions @xmath15 such that have finite energy @xcite , i.e. @xmath16 a variational method was developed by j. leray _",
    "@xcite to solve ( [ eq incompressible ns])-([eq free - divergence ] ) .",
    "this method called _ weak solutions method _ uses a free divergence test function that is multiplied by ( [ eq incompressible ns ] ) with dot product .",
    "then , an integration in @xmath17 and @xmath18 is made . a theorem proved by j. serrin ( see @xcite ) guarantees the existence of this smooth weak solutions in @xmath18 . in 1984 ,",
    "beale , kato and majda ( see @xcite ) developed a theorem for 3-d euler fluid ( i.e. a fluid with @xmath19 ) , which equation ( [ eq incompressible ns ] ) has weak solutions in @xmath18 .",
    "this theorem states that if a initial smooth solution for euler equation loses it smoothness some time later , then the maximum vorticity necesarily grows without bound as the critical time approaches . as immediate corollary of this theorem ,",
    "the existence of a smooth solution in @xmath18 is guaranteed . in 2007 ,",
    "neustupa and penel @xcite-@xcite prove that , taking boundary conditions @xmath20\\cdot\\hat{\\vec{n}}=0\\,\\,\\,\\textnormal{on}\\,\\ , \\partial\\omega , \\label{eq vorticity b - c}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is normal to surface , the velocity and the curl of vorticity are related @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath10 .",
    "the problem here , is that ( [ eq vorticity b - c ] ) imposes a restriction on the space second derivative of the velocity , while ( [ eq incompressible ns ] ) is second order in space .",
    "in this section , we will prove a similar theorem to beale - kato - majda theorem , but in this case there is a 3-d navier - stokes fluid instead of an euler fluid . in our case , we will prove that , taking suitable boundary conditions for vorticity and velocity , vorticity blows - up if , and only if , kinetic energy of a fluid particle blows - up @xmath24 .    let be @xmath15 such that ( [ eq incompressible ns])-([eq free - divergence ] ) are held . and let be the boundary conditions @xmath25 on @xmath26 , where @xmath21 is normal to surface .",
    "then , @xmath27 where @xmath23 and @xmath10 .",
    "we know that the pressure @xmath28 is the average kinetic energy of the molecules of the fluid that are colliding against the walls in a stagnant fluid .",
    "when the fluid is on stream , a new contribution due to kinetic energy of the flow takes part .",
    "so , we can add kinetic energy to pressure , subtracting @xmath29 in right and left side of ( [ eq incompressible ns ] )",
    ". then the equations ( [ eq incompressible ns ] ) can be rewritten like @xmath30 taking the scalar product of ( [ eq proof 2 ] ) with @xmath31 , we have @xmath32 and taking the laplacian of both sides of ( [ eq proof 2 ] ) , we have @xmath33 given that the fluid is free - divergence as ( [ eq free - divergence ] ) says , the first and third terms in the left side of ( [ eq proof 4 ] ) and first term in right side of ( [ eq proof 4 ] ) vanishes , while the fourth term in left side of ( [ eq proof 4 ] ) is the first term in right side of ( [ eq proof 3 ] ) .",
    "so substituting ( [ eq proof 4 ] ) in ( [ eq proof 3 ] ) , we have @xmath34 but levi - civita tensor obeys @xmath35 , so we can rewrite ( [ eq proof 5 ] ) like @xmath36",
    ". \\label{eq proof 6}\\ ] ] changing this equation to vectorial notation , it results : @xmath37 . \\label{eq",
    "proof 7}\\ ] ] if we integrate in the space region @xmath38 and time interval @xmath39 , then @xmath40 we have used the divergence theorem in the last two terms of right side of ( [ eq proof 8 ] ) , where @xmath41 is the vector normal to the surface @xmath26 . choosing the neumann boundary condition @xmath42 the last term of ( [ eq proof 8 ] ) vanishes .",
    "however , the second integral of right side of ( [ eq proof 8 ] ) vanishes if @xmath43 we can obtain ( [ eq proof 10 ] ) with the next considerations .",
    "taking into account ( [ eq proof 2 ] ) and the identity @xmath44 we have @xmath45 since the surface @xmath26 is closed and do nt change its shape with time ( that is to say @xmath46 ) , integrating ( [ eq proof 12 ] ) in @xmath26 results @xmath47 where we have used @xmath48 and the divergence theorem @xmath49\\cdot\\vec{\\hat{n}}\\,d^2x=\\int_{\\omega}\\vec{\\nabla}\\cdot\\left[\\vec{\\nabla}\\times\\left(\\vec{\\nabla}\\times\\vec{u}\\right)\\right]\\,d^3x=0 \\label{eq proof 15}\\ ] ] so , ( [ eq proof 10 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath50 taking the boundary condition ( [ eq theorem ] ) , the surface integrals of ( [ eq proof 8 ] ) vanishes . as a result , @xmath51 and the proof of the theorem follows .",
    "three consequences arise here choosing boundary coditions ( [ eq theorem ] ) for velocity and vorticity .",
    "first of all , relation ( [ eq proof 17 ] ) means that kinetic energy in the volume diminishes with time , if vorticity is not null .",
    "this is perfectly reasonable since kinematic viscosity produces heat from kinetic energy .",
    "second , if the fluid is an euler fluid , i.e. @xmath19 , the fluid do nt disipate kinetic energy and the kinetic energy do nt depends explicitly on time .",
    "and third , vorticity controls the blow - up in time . + boundary coditions ( [ eq theorem ] ) are less restrictive than ( [ eq vorticity b - c ] ) , because the firsts are space first derivative and the seconds are higher order derivatives .",
    "the theorem proposed is a similar result to beale - kato - majda theorem , with navier - stokes fluid instead of euler fluid .",
    "but there is not a proof that ( [ eq theorem 2 ] ) be a more general result of beale - kato - majda theorem in @xmath52 , because right hand side of ( [ eq proof 10 ] ) vanishes in euler fluid and because ( [ eq theorem ] ) condition has not sense in euler fluids .",
    "this theorem is more powerful than the leray weak solutions method in the temporal domain , but more weak in the space domain due to boundary conditions .",
