    "with the construction of icecube at the south pole @xcite and of antares in the mediterranean sea @xcite , together with existing r&d programs for a cubic kilometer array at these latitudes @xcite , neutrino astronomy is entering a very promising era .",
    "icecube , when complete in 2011 , will consist of up to 80 strings on a hexagonal grid with 124 m spacing , with each string holding 60 optical modules vertically spaced by 17 m. the instrumented part of the strings is deployed between 1450 and 2450 m deep in the ice .",
    "the experiment profits from experience acquired with the amanda detector , taking data since 1996 and completed in 2000 with 19 strings containing 677 total optical modules between 1500 and 2000 m below the ice surface . studies on the optimal configuration for a cubic kilometer array in the mediterranean are ongoing , and the amount of photomultipliers ( pmts ) generally considered is somewhat larger than for icecube , around 6000 @xcite and up to about 9000 @xcite .",
    "the community is refining methods to detect low statistics signals amongst large backgrounds .",
    "the expected background from atmospheric neutrinos in a cubic kilometer detector is of the order of 50 000 upgoing events per year after selection criteria guaranteeing good angular resolution and rejection of misreconstructed cosmic ray muons .",
    "point - like signals of few events need to be singled out among this large number of background events .",
    "two features distinguish signal from the background :    * the angular distribution .",
    "the signal would cluster around the direction of the neutrino source ( assumed here to be point - like ) with a spread depending on the detector angular resolution .",
    "angular resolution is limited by detector geometry and by the propagation characteristics of light in the medium , specifically by photon scattering and absorption .",
    "the pointing accuracy for astrophysical sources is also limited by the kinematic angle between the parent neutrino and the muon . *",
    "the energy distribution .",
    "the differential energy spectrum of the signal expected from fermi acceleration mechanisms is close to e@xmath0 , harder than that of atmospheric neutrinos due to the showering process in the atmosphere .",
    "the differential spectrum of atmospheric neutrinos approximately follows a power law of e@xmath1 above 100 gev .",
    "other signatures may be used , including time dependencies of emissions measured in other detectors such as correlations with gamma ray bursts or tev gamma ray flares .",
    "however , we focus on steady emissions of neutrinos with time .",
    "the methods we have implemented exploit the two features listed above .",
    "we show that unbinned methods based on the likelihood ratio hypothesis test perform better than methods based on angular bins , and we show that the introduction of energy dependent information , e.g. the number of hit pmts , helps discriminate signal and allows an energy spectrum reconstruction even when few events are detected on top of the background .",
    "other unbinned methods have been studied and developed by other authors @xcite .",
    "[ sec2 ] describes the simulation we use to generate realistic samples of signal and background events in a cubic kilometer detector .",
    "[ sec3 ] describes the unbinned method based on a likelihood ratio analysis , comparing a signal plus background hypothesis to a background only hypothesis .",
    "this method has been applied to icecube data for 9 strings and to 2005 - 6 data of the amanda - ii detector  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we describe the performance of the methods and show results in terms of discovery potential .",
    "we also emphasize the importance of using energy related information to increase the discovery potential and show the ability to determine the spectral index of the neutrino source .",
    "the method is then compared to a search using angular bins , more traditionally applied in neutrino astronomy @xcite .",
    "we wish to compare several neutrino point source search methods and draw general conclusions on the discovery potential for cubic kilometer scale neutrino telescopes under construction in the ice and under study in the sea water .",
    "we have performed a realistic simulation of both atmospheric neutrino events and signal events from an astrophysical neutrino point - like source .",
    "this is accomplished by a detailed detector volume simulation with simplifications expected to have negligible impact on the comparison .",
    "the simulated detector consists of 4860 optical modules arranged in 81 strings .",
    "the strings are evenly distributed on a square @xmath2 grid with 125 meters separating nearest neighbors , and the modules on each string are vertically separated by 16.67 m , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : array ] .",
    "the modules are simulated as containing a downward looking 10 inch photomultiplier with 20% quantum efficiency .",
    "a multiplicity trigger requires that at minimum 14 modules register a photon from an event .",
    "we neglect trigger time windows and photon hits from photomultiplier dark noise , since hits unrelated to the track can presumably be removed with coincidence requirements , filtering strategies , and topological cuts .",
    "we assume the detector is located at the south pole .",
    "a different location would imply a different visibility of sources in the sky , since at the south pole half of the sky is always visible while the other half is inaccessible . at other latitudes",
    "the detector is always blind to less than one half of the sky , always sensitive to a region of similar size in the opposite hemisphere , and sensitive to the remainder of the sky for a fraction of the day .",
    "we have prepared an algorithm to simulate the muon neutrino interactions in a volume and propagate the secondary muon in the ice , producing the light detected by the pmts . for neutrino generation , we use an updated version of the simulation described in @xcite .",
    "we use the more recent cteq6 @xcite structure functions for the deep inelastic cross section of muon neutrinos and simulate the earth density profile in @xcite to account for the absorption of high energy neutrinos .",
    "the muon is propagated to the instrumented region using the mum propagation code @xcite .",
    "we model the muon energy loss within the detector as de / dx = a + be , where a = 0.268 gev / m accounts for ionization energy losses , and b = 0.00047  m@xmath3 for bremsstrahlung , pair production , and photonuclear interactions @xcite .",
    "the number of pmts recording light , or ` hit ' , increases with the energy loss rate , and thus the energy , of the muon .",
    "since the energy dependent processes are stochastic , treating them as continuous may overestimate the number of modules hit by a small amount at pev energies .",
    "however , high energy muons where this effect is significant are very bright and tend to produce photon hits in many more modules than the trigger threshold of 14 , so we conclude that the impact on event triggering is negligible",
    ".    photon propagation in the detector medium has a significant impact on the detector response .",
    "we assume a homogeneous detector medium in which the photon density at the sensor can be described as a simple function with respect to the distance of the muon track .",
    "photons are propagated with an effective scattering length of 21 m and an absorption length of 120 m , which are typical values for south pole ice @xcite .",
    "[ fig : photondensity ] shows the assumed photon density for a minimum ionizing muon as a function of distance for the case of ice . for a muon with arbitrary energy loss de / dx ,",
    "the photon density is scaled by the equivalent energy loss of a minimum ionizing muon , i.e. scaled by de / dx / ( 0.268 gev / m ) .",
    "the number of photoelectrons recorded from each pmt is a poisson random variable with mean equal to the product of this photon density , pmt photocathode area , and pmt quantum efficiency . for each pmt",
    ", a hit is determined by randomly sampling this poisson probability of observing at least one photoelectron .",
    "we have generated @xmath4 upgoing neutrino events isotropically entering the earth .",
    "the events are drawn from an e@xmath5 energy spectrum between 10 and @xmath6 gev .",
    "this hard spectrum allows efficient generation of high energy events .",
    "events passing the trigger threshold of @xmath7 hit pmts are kept , resulting in the neutrino effective area shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aeff ] .",
    "the neutrino effective area represents the equivalent detector area for a hypothetical instrument with 100% efficiency for detecting the passage of neutrinos .",
    "the effective area is much smaller than the dimensions of the detector due to the small cross section of neutrino interaction and , for larger zenith angles and high energies , neutrino absorption on transit through the earth .",
    "it is a useful parameter for determining event rates and making comparisons between experiments .",
    "the event rate for a neutrino model predicting a flux @xmath8 is given by @xmath9    using the atmospheric neutrino flux of barr et al .",
    "@xcite , we find approximately 134 000 atmospheric neutrino events per year at trigger level with a median energy of 670 gev and a slight density dependence on zenith angle , and thus declination , of @xmath1015% .",
    "this number of events will be reduced however by topological and reconstruction cuts necessary to eliminate the large background of misreconstructed downgoing muons from cosmic ray air showers .",
    "we estimate 50% of atmospheric events will be lost to reject this background ; thus we choose 67 000 events from the atmospheric neutrino sample for our data set , roughly representing a year of data .",
    "cuts applied to a real data sample may have some small energy dependence , i.e. efficiency may drop for low energy events , but we do not consider this effect .",
    "we generate astrophysical signal neutrinos similarly ; however , they are simulated at a fixed declination and weighted differently than atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "we consider for the signal a power law neutrino spectrum with spectral indices ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 . the number of hit modules distribution for atmospheric neutrinos and several signal spectral indices is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_est ] .",
    "angular reconstruction errors for a cubic kilometer detector in ice are shown to be @xmath110.7@xmath12 for neutrinos of energies @xmath13 tev @xcite .",
    "we simulate this reconstruction error by adding to the muon direction a space angle error randomly sampled from a polar gaussian distribution with standard deviation 0.7@xmath12 .",
    "considering both this reconstruction error and the neutrino - muon vertex angle , the resulting median angular resolution for an e@xmath0 signal is 0.86@xmath12 and is larger for softer spectra . a comparison to a detector with angular resolution 0.2@xmath12 , which may be achieved with a detector in sea water ,",
    "is shown in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] .",
    "muon energy reconstruction errors in neutrino telescopes are typically of the order of 0.3 in @xmath14e@xmath15 above a few tev @xcite , limited by the stochastic nature of muon energy losses . to simulate this effect",
    ", we assign to each event a reconstructed error sampled from a gaussian distribution of width 0.3 in the logarithm of energy .",
    "the reconstructed energy for atmospheric neutrino events and several power law spectra is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_est ] .",
    "energy resolution degrades below a few tev ; thus the energy resolution we assign to such events is unrealistically accurate .",
    "however , the power to detect astrophysical sources resides in the ability to discriminate high energy neutrinos from lower energy atmospheric neutrino background , so we conclude overestimating the energy resolution of such lower energy events does not affect the result significantly .    cc",
    "in the context of a muon neutrino point source search , the data from a neutrino telescope consists of a set of muon events spread over the sky , each with reconstructed direction ( declination and right ascension ) , energy , and time . while event time is useful in searches for short neutrino bursts or periodic neutrino emission , we focus on searches for continuous neutrino emission and disregard event time .",
    "the vast majority of events are muons produced by atmospheric neutrinos . at any celestial direction ,",
    "the data can be modeled by two hypotheses :    * @xmath16 : the data consists solely of background atmospheric neutrino events . *",
    "@xmath17 : the data consists of atmospheric neutrino events as well as astrophysical neutrino events produced by a source with some strength and energy spectrum .",
    "the likelihood of obtaining the data given each hypothesis is calculable , and the ratio of likelihoods , or equivalently the log of the likelihood ratio , serves as a powerful test .",

    "suppose we wish to test the existence of a source at a known direction @xmath22 using a set of data events , each with reconstructed direction @xmath23 and reconstructed energy @xmath24 .",
    "events reconstructed outside a declination band centered at @xmath22 with a width several times the detector resolution are unlikely to have been produced by a source at @xmath22 and can be disregarded , leaving @xmath25 events in the band .",
    "each event inside the band is assigned a source probability density corresponding to the probability of the event belonging to a source at @xmath22 .",
    "the source is assumed to emit neutrinos according to an e@xmath26 power law energy spectrum .",
    "the source probability density is the product of a spatial density function describing the potential of an event reconstructed with direction @xmath23 to have true direction @xmath22 and the probability of observing reconstructed muon energy @xmath24 given source spectral index @xmath27 :    @xmath28    the spatial probability density component @xmath29 can be obtained directly from event reconstruction when maximum likelihood reconstruction techniques are used @xcite .",
    "the structure of the reconstruction likelihood near the most likely direction @xmath23 provides an event by event estimate of reconstruction uncertainty and yields a gaussian spatial probability density profile :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the space angle difference between source and reconstructed event directions , and @xmath32 is the reconstruction error estimate . the vertex angle between the neutrino and muon is neglected in @xmath33 .",

    "this trend is caused by two factors : higher energy events have a smaller neutrino - muon vertex angle and thus better resolution , and high energy astrophysical neutrinos produce muons at the detector with much higher energy than typical atmospheric neutrinos .",

    "we have shown that likelihood methods improve discovery potential using differences in both the angular distribution of events and energy spectra between the background and signal hypotheses .",

    "<S> neutrino telescopes are moving steadily toward the goal of detecting astrophysical neutrinos from the most powerful galactic and extragalactic sources . here </S>",

    "<S> we simulate an ideal cubic kilometer detector based on real world performance of existing detectors such as amanda , icecube , and antares . </S>",
    "<S> an unbinned likelihood ratio method is applied , making use of the point spread function and energy distribution of simulated neutrino signal events to separate them from the background of atmospheric neutrinos produced by cosmic ray showers . </S>",
    "<S> the unbinned point source analyses are shown to perform better than binned searches and , depending on the source spectral index , the use of energy information is shown to improve discovery potential by almost a factor of two .    </S>",
