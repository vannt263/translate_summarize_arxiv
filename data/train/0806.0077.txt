    "this occurs because each additional excitation pulse reduces the probability that the dot remains in the original , _ post _ _ cx _ recombination , single carrier spin state .    in summary , the results of _",
    "cx_-_x _ crosscorrelation in magnetic field provide a clear evidence of the polarization memory extending over a few excitation pulses and of effective optical _ read - out _ of the single carrier spin in the dot .",
    "as already mentioned , the singlet ground state of the charged exciton contains two identical carriers of opposite spins .",
    "one of them decays in _ cx _ recombination , emitting a photon with circular polarization determined by its spin .",
    "the spin polarization of the second carrier will determine the polarization of an _ x _ photon emitted during _ x _ recombination after next laser pulse .",
    "this will happen after trapping a carrier of opposite charge .",
    "if the spin polarization is conserved over the repetition period , the _",
    "cx _ and _ x _ photons produced by two consecutive pulses will thus have opposite circular polarizations .",
    "in reality , this spin conservation is never perfect and can be measured by polarization correlation coefficient @xmath41 defined as @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes intensity of the correlated counts in the _ cx_-_x _ histogram measured with _",

    "values of @xmath46 determined for peaks of @xmath48 are shown in figure  [ fig : poldegree ] .",
    "the coefficient @xmath49 is equivalent to the ratio of the probability that _ x _ photon with polarization defined by the carrier spin conservation is emitted following the @xmath34-th pulse to the overall probability of _ x _ photon emission following the @xmath34-th pulse .",
    "thus , @xmath49 can be written taking into account different polarization loss mechanisms .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath34  =  1 peak : @xmath50 where symbols @xmath51 denote occupation probability of qd states directly after an excitation pulse , which is assumed to be short enough to neglect recombination during excitation ( see discussion further below ) .",
    "the upper index given in parentheses encodes the pulse number @xmath34 , while the lower index @xmath52 encodes the dot state .",
    "factor @xmath53 ( in the case of selected qd estimated at 96.2% at @xmath1  =  5  t ) represents the impact of elliptical polarization of the excitonic eigenstate .",
    "the fraction with _ xx _ and _ x _ occupation probabilities represents polarization loss due to biexciton recombination channel , where no polarization is transferred by the singlet _ xx _ state . since @xmath28 is _ x _ spin - flip time ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : results.2 ] ) , expression @xmath28/(@xmath54 ) represents the loss of the exciton spin polarization during its lifetime .",
    "finally , @xmath55 represents other possible loss mechanisms .",
    "in particular , it could be a spin - flip of the remaining carrier .",
    "however , we checked that magnitude of the peaks in the polarized _",
    "correlation histogram remains unchanged after doubling of the excitation repetition period ( not shown ) .",
    "this indicates a negligible carrier spin relaxation over the timescale comparable with the repetition period .",
    "a possible polarization loss during _ x _ state formation by capture of a second carrier of an opposite charge will be also found negligible ( see discussion in the following ) .",
    "hence , the respective polarization loss results from an interaction of the confined electron with non - equilibrium population of carriers ( exchange interaction ) and/or phonons ( possible local heating of the sample ) excited by laser pulses .    the timescale of the observed memory effect might also suggest that _ cx _ recombination leaves in the dot an electron and not a hole .",
    "in contrast to the case of the electron , the spin relaxation of the hole is known to be relatively fast ,  @xcite occurring in the time of the order comparable with the repetition period of probing the carrier s spin state in our experiment .",
    "thus , we make tentative assumption that _ cx _ is negatively charged .",
    "we shall also comment on the influence of dark exciton formation on excitonic polarization degree .",
    "dark , nonradiative exciton state is formed in the case when carrier is captured by the dot already containing a carrier of opposite charge and the same spin . after a spin - flip process",
    "the dark exciton converts into a bright state and decays radiatively .",
    "such an excitonic luminescence could lower the effective excitonic pl polarization degree .",
    "however , the time constant of dark exciton spin - flip is large compared to the excitation repetition period .",
    "this is known from the comparison between the results of unpolarized _ cx_-_x _ crosscorrelation measurements performed with two different repetition periods .",
    "@xcite they reveal no significant difference in intensity of peaks of the same number in two histograms .",
    "thus , the influence of the dark exciton formation on exciton polarization degree can be neglected and it was not taken into account in the construction of the model describing experimental data .    the measured polarization may be understood as a product of carrier spin polarization reduced by _ read - out _ efficiency ( first two factors in eq .",
    "[ eq : pcalc ] ) and loss mechanisms ( last two factors in eq .",
    "[ eq : pcalc ] ) . in order to determine the most prominent factors lowering the measured polarization we introduce a simple rate equation model .",
    "it allows us to compute the occupation probabilities necessary for calculation of @xmath56 .",
    "we consider a ladder of states involving five states : from the empty dot to the biexciton state .",
    "since only one charged exciton line of significant intensity is observed , we neglect states of opposite charge ( corresponding weak trion line visible in fig .  [ fig : plspectrum ] at 2217  mev ) .",
    "we define a set of variables @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 describing the occupation of levels ( encoded by the lower index ) just after the excitation by the @xmath34-th pulse is finished .",
    "it is known from independent measurements on the same sample  @xcite that the effective excitation pulse duration ( @xmath62  ps ) is much shorter than radiative decay times ( hundreds of ps ) , therefore we neglect recombination during the excitation process .",

    "escape of the carriers out of the dot is not taken into account as it has been shown to be negligible .",
    "@xcite our simulations show that within the assumptions of the model , the shape @xmath66 of the excitation pulse is not important .",

    "therefore , the loss of the electron polarization represented by @xmath55 takes place following each excitation pulse .",
    "this allows us to write down @xmath56 for consecutive pulses in the form : @xmath85 the factor @xmath86 reflects the probability that qd keeps its one - carrier state unchanged through @xmath87 excitation pulses .",
    "the factor @xmath88 represents degree of conservation of the electron spin following @xmath34 consecutive excitation pulses .",
    "its exponential dependence on the peak number @xmath34 ( evidenced by fig .",
    "[ fig : poldegree ] ) confirms the role of laser pulses as the source of polarization loss described by @xmath55 .",
    "integration of eqs .",
    "[ eq : rateeq ] yielded probabilities @xmath51 of finding the dot in a state @xmath52 following @xmath34-th excitation pulse .",

    "the satisfactory agreement between calculated and experimental values justifies the introduced model .    to summarize this section , _",
    "cx_-_x _ crosscorrelation measurements provide evidence for single carrier spin polarization memory in magnetic field .",
    "we described quantitatively the polarization memory after consecutive excitation pulses .",
    "comparison between the model and the experiment shows that carrier spin conservation and the optical _ read - out _ efficiency are close to 100% in the limit of low excitation power .",
    "the maximum efficiency of the spin _ read - out _ obtained in the experiment is 68% .",
    "the _ cx_-_x _",
    "crosscorrelation performed for different excitation powers allowed us to verify the expected influence of biexciton formation on the loss of polarization memory .",
    "we performed polarized crosscorrelation measurements of photons from exciton , biexciton , and trion recombination in a single , anisotropic cdte / znte quantum dot . in absence of magnetic field",
    "we observed a strong collinear polarization correlation ( @xmath90 ) of photons emitted in the biexciton - exciton cascade .",
    "when zeeman splitting dominates over anisotropic exchange splitting , the photons in the cascade become correlated in opposite circular polarizations ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "exciton spin relaxation time values @xmath28  =  @xmath0  ns at @xmath1  =  0  t and @xmath2  ns at @xmath1  =  5  t were determined from the _ xx_-_x _ correlation measurements .",
    "trion - exciton crosscorrelation measurements conducted in magnetic field of 5  t have revealed long timescale ( at least tens of ns ) polarization memory in the qd excitonic emission .",
    "effective optical _ read - out _ of the spin polarization of a single carrier confined in the anisotropic qd has been demonstrated in magnetic field .",
    "the decay of the polarization memory with the increasing number of excitation pulses separating two correlated photons has been described with a simple rate equation model .",
    "it was attributed to the combined influence of competitive biexciton spin singlet recombination and loss of carrier spin polarization , perturbed primarily by the very laser light used for the spin _ read - out_. efficiency of optical _ read - out _ of the spin in magnetic field turned out to be dependent on the excitation power ( the maximum efficiency obtained in the experiment was 68% ) .",
    "the results obtained indicate cdte / znte qds as a valuable proving ground for future applications of polarization controlled single photon emitters or spin qubits in the area of quantum information processing ."
