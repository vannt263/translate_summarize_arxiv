    "we are interested here in the large - time behaviour of the process @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is defined via the system of stochastic differential equations @xmath2 with @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath7 is a two - dimensional standard brownian motion .",
    "the couple @xmath8 represents the restriction to continuous paths of the whole class of affine stochastic volatility models with jumps ( asvm ) , introduced by keller - ressel  @xcite .",
    "in particular it encompasses the popular heston stochastic volatility model  @xcite , in which @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the weak convergence of the process @xmath0 has been studied in  @xcite for the heston model and in  @xcite for asvm , via the grtner - ellis theorem from large deviations theory .",
    "this convergence is the main ingredient needed to obtain the large - maturity behaviour of the implied volatility in these models .",
    "however the authors have imposed technical conditions on the parameters , which ensures that the assumptions of the grtner - ellis theorem are met : ( i ) the limiting cumulant generating function @xmath11 is essentially smooth inside a domain @xmath12 and ( ii ) the interior @xmath12 contains the origin .",
    "even though these conditions are usually satisfied in practice , they can actually be broken when calibrating the model for volatile markets . in terms of the parameters",
    "these two conditions  assumed in  @xcite  read @xmath10 and @xmath13 .",
    "the second assumption makes sense on equity markets where the correlation is usually negative .",
    "however , on fx markets , the correlation between the asset and its volatility is not necessarily so ( see  @xcite for instance ) , and a large value of the variance of volatility parameter @xmath14 can violate this assumption . in  @xcite , andersen and piterbarg studied the moment explosions of the heston model ( and other stochastic volatility models ) .",
    "they assume @xmath10 , but it appears that the restriction @xmath13 may also be needed . in  @xcite",
    "the authors highlighted the importance of this latter condition by proving that the heston model remains of heston form under the share measure ( i.e. taking the share price as the numeraire ) with new mean - reversion speed @xmath15 .",
    "this in particular implies that the left wing of the smile could be deduced from the right wing automatically by symmetry .",
    "this may not be true however when this condition fails . reversing the symmetry , the case where the mean - reversion @xmath16 ( in the original measure ) is positive becomes interesting to study as well .",
    "we show here that a large deviations principle still holds ( as @xmath17 tends to infinity ) for the process @xmath0 when the two conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) above fail , i.e. without the technical assumptions of  @xcite . as an application",
    ", we translate this asymptotic behaviour into asymptotics of the implied volatility , corresponding to european vanilla options with payoff @xmath18 , for any real number @xmath19 . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors proved that the so - called _ stochastic volatility inspired _ ( svi ) parametric form ",
    "first proposed in  @xcite  of the implied volatility was the genuine limit ( as the maturity tends to infinity ) of the heston implied volatility under the same technical conditions as in  @xcite .",
    "we extend the scope of this result by proving that it remains partially true ",
    "i.e . on some subsets of the real line  without the technical conditions mentioned above .    in section  [ sec : ldpheston ] , we study the limiting behaviour of the limiting cumulant generating function of the process @xmath0 and state the main result of the paper ( theorem  [ thm : ldpaffinethm ] ) , i.e. a large deviations principle for this process . in section  [ sec : ratefunctionsandoptionprices ] , we translate this ldp into option price and implied volatility asymptotics .",
