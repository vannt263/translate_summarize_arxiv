    "the black hole formation in high - energy particle collisions is an important issue especially in the context of tev gravity scenarios  @xcite . in the theory with large extra dimensions ,",
    "the planck energy could be of the order of tev and collisions of particles with the center - of - mass energy greater than the planckian one will occur in future accelerators such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of mini - black - hole production , especially at the threshold of this effect , would require the complete theory of quantum gravity .",
    "however , if the mass of a created black hole is much larger than the planck mass , one can use a semiclassical approximation to describe such processes . in this approximation ,",
    "the black hole formation in particle collision and its subsequent decay in the process of the hawking evaporation are studied in the framework of the ( semi)classical general relativity .",
    "the apparent horizon ( ah ) is a useful tool for estimation of black hole production rate in this approximation , because the existence of an ah is a sufficient condition for the black hole formation .",
    "the first work along this line was done by eardley and giddings @xcite in the four - dimensional case .",
    "since the high - energy particles are relativistic , they used the aichelburg - sexl ( as ) metric @xcite to describe the gravitational field of such particles before their collision .",
    "the as metric can be obtained by boosting a schwarzschild black hole to the speed of light and keeping the energy @xmath1 of the boosted black hole fixed .",
    "the gravitational field of the as particle is a shock and it is localized on the null plane ( @xmath2 for one of the particles and @xmath3 for the other one ) .",
    "one of the null generators on each of the null planes represents a particle trajectory , while its gravitational field is distributed in the transverse plane orthogonal to the direction of motion .",
    "two as particles do not interact before the collision and the metric outside of the interacting region is known explicitly .",
    "eardley and giddings analytically studied the ah on some slice ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) and derived the maximal impact parameter @xmath6 for the ah formation .",
    "the quantity @xmath7 gives the lower bound on the cross section of the black hole production .",
    "the results of @xcite were generalized by one of us and nambu @xcite for the mini - black - hole formation in the higher - dimensional spacetimes . in this work",
    "the numerical calculations were used .",
    "later , one of us and rychkov @xcite improved these results by studying the ah on the futuremost slice that can be adopted without the knowledge of the interacting region ( i.e. , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) . using this approach the stronger lower bound @xmath10 ^ 2 \\simeq 2$]@xmath11 on the cross section of the black hole production in the collision of as particles was obtained for spacetime dimensionality @xmath12@xmath13 .",
    "certainly the model of colliding as particles is oversimplified .",
    "the as particles are assumed to be neutral and spinless . in reality",
    "all the known elementary particles have spin and most of them have either electric or color charge as well",
    ".    charged particles have additional charge - charge interaction besides the gravitational interaction .",
    "moreover their gravitational interaction can also be modified .",
    "the latter effect was discussed to some extent by one of us and mann @xcite . in that paper",
    "a boosted reissner - nordstrm metric was used as the model of an ultrarelativistic charged particle and the head - on collision in a spacetime with an arbitrary number of dimensions was studied .",
    "the results obtained in that paper indicate that the charge makes the ah formation more difficult .",
    "it was also argued that the effects of the quantum electrodynamics could change the results .",
    "the results of @xcite were later used by gingrich @xcite who reconsidered the black hole production rate at the lhc .    in the quantum mechanical description ,",
    "the colliding particles are characterized by wave packets which have finite duration in time @xcite . to take into account this effect as well as to include spin - spin interaction , in this paper we study head - on collisions of two gyratons .",
    "the gyraton model was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the motivation of this paper was to find the gravitational field generated by a beam pulse of spinning radiation with a finite time duration , which is propagating at the speed of light . in the gyraton model ,",
    "the metric outside of the source satisfies the vacuum einstein equations and the gravitational field is distributed in the plane transverse to the direction of motion . unlike an as particle , the gravitational field of a gyraton is not a shock wave but has the finite duration in time .",
    "a gyraton may have spin which manifests itself in the dragging - into - rotation effect .",
    "the as particle metrics can be obtained from the gyraton solutions if the duration is taken infinitely small and the spin vanishes .",
    "general properties of gyraton metrics were studied in detail in @xcite . electrically charged gyratons and gyratons in the supergravity were discussed in @xcite , respectively .",
    "gyraton solutions can be also generalized to the case when the spacetime is asymptotically anti - de sitter @xcite .",
    "colliding gyratons which we consider in this paper differ from the as particles both by the presence of spin and the finite duration in time .",
    "let us discuss briefly what kind of new features one can expect .",
    "first natural question is : can one include spin effects in the interaction between highly nonrelativistic particles by boosting the kerr metric ? such boosted kerr black hole solutions were considered , e.g. in @xcite , in the four - dimensional spacetime and in @xcite in higher dimensions .",
    "the main problem in this approach is the following . in order to have a well - defined limit for the boosted metric",
    ", one needs to keep the energy @xmath1 of the system fixed , so that the mass of the black hole @xmath14 must vanish when the @xmath15-factor infinitely grows .",
    "if one assumes that the spin @xmath16 remains finite in this limit , the rotation parameter @xmath17 infinitely grows , so that the metric describes a naked singularity .",
    "the radius of the ring singularity is of the order of @xmath18 and also infinitely grows .",
    "the latter problem can be avoided by assuming that the rotation parameter @xmath18 remains finite in the infinite boost limit , as it was done in the above references .",
    "although finite results different from the as particle can be obtained by this procedure , fixing @xmath18 means that the spin @xmath19 of the boosted object vanishes .",
    "furthermore , in this limit we have an object of typical size @xmath18 , which does not satisfy the requirement that we would like to have a point - like object .",
    "thus a boosted kerr black hole does not provide one with a suitable model for an ultrarelativistic particle with spin , e.g. for a photon . in the gyraton model",
    "the spin is easily included .",
    "there is another aspect of the high - energy particle collision which the gyraton model may help to understand better .",
    "recently the validity of an as particle as the model of a high - energy elementary particle was questioned in @xcite . in this model the curvature invariants at the moment of the collision of the two planes , representing the colliding particles , are infinite , so that formally higher - curvature quantum corrections may be important .",
    "this problem was discussed in @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the quantum effects , such as the finite size and finite duration in time of the incoming wave packets , can help to solve this problem .",
    "the quantum - to - classical transition in the description of the mini - black - hole formation in the particle collision is an interesting open question .",
    "we do not address it in our paper , but instead we use the gyraton model in order to discuss how the finiteness of the duration in time of the colliding objects modifies the results of the as approximation . in such an approach , the gyratons might be considered as an effective model for the quantum wave packets .    with these motivations we study the ah formation in the head - on collision of gyratons .",
    "for simplicity we consider the four - dimensional case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce several gyraton models : a gyraton without spin , its as limit , and spinning gyratons . as for spinning gyratons , we consider two types depending on relative locations of the energy and spin profiles .",
    "then we set up five cases of head - on collisions of gyratons . in sec .",
    "iii , we derive an ah equation on the future edge of the spacetime region before interaction , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we present the numerical results of this study in sec .",
    "the conditions on the spin and on the energy and spin durations for the ah formation are obtained for each of the collision cases . then in sec .",
    "v we focus our attention on the study of the spin - spin interaction .",
    "in general , this is a complicated problem , since it requires the knowledge of the metric in the region of interaction . to obtain it",
    ", one needs to solve nonlinear einstein equations .",
    "we simplify the problem by assuming that the spins of the interacting objects are small and solve the equations by using a method of perturbation .",
    "then we study again the ah formation on the new slice that is the future edge of the solved region .",
    "in the adopted approximation we obtain spin - spin interaction corrections to the mini - black - hole production .",
    "vi contains a summary of the results and a discussion of their possible applications for the study of mini - black - hole production at the lhc .",
    "in this section , we set up the problem of the head - on collisions of two gyratons .",
    "we first review the gyraton model in a four - dimensional spacetime in sec .",
    "ii a. the gyraton has the total energy @xmath1 and the spin @xmath20 which are distributed in time .",
    "their time profiles are characterized by two functions .",
    "we introduce four kinds of gyratons by specifying these two functions .",
    "next in sec .",
    "ii b , we introduce a system of null geodesic coordinates , which is necessary for specifying the slice to study the ah existence .",
    "it is also useful for clarifying the gravitational field of gyratons . in sec .",
    "ii c , we set up five cases of head - on collisions of two gyratons , using the introduced four gyratons .",
    "the gyraton model was proposed in @xcite . in that paper , the gravitational field generated by a beam pulse of spinning radiation",
    "was first studied in the weak field approximation and then the exact solutions of the einstein equations were obtained , which reduce to the approximate solution at far distance from the source .",
    "these solutions were obtained in any number of spacetime dimensions . in particular , a four - dimensional gyraton has the metric @xmath21 this metric represents a spacetime in which a segment - shaped source located at @xmath22 with the total energy @xmath1 and the spin @xmath20 is propagating at the speed of light along @xmath23 . the existence of the term @xmath24 in eq .   indicates presence of a dragging - into - rotation effect generated by the spin source .",
    "the functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 are arbitrary functions satisfying the normalization conditions @xmath27 they represent the energy and spin density profiles , respectively .    introducing the new coordinates @xmath28 ,",
    "non - zero components of the energy - momentum tensor of the gyraton are calculated as @xmath29 @xmath30 these formulas show that the source has an infinitely narrow shape . for a realistic beam pulse , the source should have a finite radius @xmath31 and the metric will take a different form from eq .   for @xmath32 .",
    "therefore eq .   is considered to be the metric outside of the source @xmath33 . in this paper",
    ", we do not take account of this finiteness ( in space ) of the beam pulse for simplicity and adopt eq .   for arbitrary values of @xmath34 ( i.e. , @xmath35 ) .",
    "hereafter we adopt the gravitational radius of @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37 , as the unit of the length . in this length unit ,",
    "the gyraton metric is represented as @xmath38 here , @xmath39 is a dimensionless quantity defined by @xmath40 and we use @xmath39 as a parameter to specify the spin of the gyraton .",
    "the gyraton model is specified by determining the functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the interaction between two gyratons with arbitrary profiles @xmath25 and @xmath26 is a quite complicated problem which , in the general case , requires numerical calculations .",
    "hence it is natural to consider first the simplest profiles for which the null geodesic coordinates can be studied analytically .",
    "for this reason , in this paper we consider four types of gyratons whose energy and spin profiles are as shown in fig .",
    "[ p - j - profiles ] .",
    "we will explain them one by one in the following . for convenience , we introduce the following function @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the heaviside step function .",
    "its integral over @xmath43 is 1 , and in the limit @xmath44 it gives a @xmath45-function .",
    "the first one is a gyraton without spin with energy duration @xmath0 . for this model ,",
    "we adopt @xmath46 this model is useful for studying the effect of the energy duration on the ah formation .",
    "we simply call it a `` spinless gyraton '' or a `` @xmath1gyraton '' because it has only one parameter , energy @xmath1",
    ".      the second one is an aichelburg - sexl ( as ) particle @xcite with @xmath47 this is the limit @xmath44 of the @xmath1-gyraton .",
    "hereafter we call it an `` as  gyraton '' for short",
    ".      the remaining two gyratons , which are referred to as an `` _ a_gyraton '' and a `` _ b_gyraton '' , have nonzero spin .",
    "we adopt the following functions of @xmath25 and @xmath26 for _ a_ and _ b_ gyratons : @xmath48 in these two models , @xmath0 represents the spin duration and the energy has zero duration .",
    "we call them an _ a_gyraton and a _ b_gyraton , respectively , because for the _",
    "a_gyraton , the spin source comes _ after _ the energy source , while for the _",
    "b_gyraton , the spin source comes _ before _ the energy source .",
    "these two models are useful for studying the effect of the spin and its density duration on the ah formation . by comparing the results of _ a_ and _ b_ gyratons",
    ", we can understand to what extent the obtained results depend on relative positions of the energy and spin density profiles .",
    "each of the gyratons is reduced to an as ",
    "gyraton if we take @xmath49 .",
    "readers might wonder why we do not adopt @xmath50 for spinning gyratons .",
    "this is because of a technical problem . in the next subsection",
    ", we derive a coordinate system based on the null geodesic congruences .",
    "this coordinate system can be analytically derived for _ a_ and _ b_ gyratons , but not for @xmath50 .      in this subsection , we introduce null geodesic coordinates , which are very useful for specifying the slice on which we study the ah .",
    "we introduce new coordinates @xmath51 by @xmath52 we assume that the two coordinate systems coincide for @xmath53 and hence @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 . for @xmath57 , we require a line @xmath58 to be a null geodesic and the coordinate @xmath59 to be its affine parameter .",

    "we should point out that there is a coordinate singularity at @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "the shape of the singularity is shown by a solid line at the left plot of fig .",

    ". therefore we call it the _ crossing singularity_.      finally we obtain the formulas for @xmath64 and @xmath65 of a spinning _ b_gyraton .",

    "[ nullray - follow ] .      consider two gyratons and assume that each of them belongs to one of the four types described above .",
    "we obtain several different configurations for the collisions of these gyratons . to illustrate main features of these collisions , in this subsection we set up five cases of the head - on collision of two gyratons which are of the most interest .",
    "the incoming gyratons are referred to as gyraton  1 and gyraton  2 .",
    "let us divide a spacetime for the two - gyraton system into four regions : @xmath97 because the gyratons propagate at the speed of light , they do not interact with each other before the collision . thus we can use the metric of the gyraton  1 in the regions i and ii and the metric of the gyraton  2 in the regions i and iii ( by changing @xmath59 and @xmath98 ) .",

    "now we discuss the possible applications of the obtained results for mini black hole production at the lhc in the tev gravity scenarios where @xmath418 .",
    "let us consider the collision of two spinning particles , and use our result of the ( 2_a _ ) case , i.e. the collision of two identical _",

    ", we find @xmath425 and @xmath426 hence , the above two conditions are satisfied and the black hole is expected to form in the head - on collision under our assumption .",
    "thus , the effect of spins of incoming particles might not be significant for the black hole production rate .",
    "still , the spin might change the cross section of the black hole production by a factor and studying this effect would be interesting .",
    "we also revisit the study by giddings and rychkov @xcite , because our study is related to the assumption they made . in that paper",
    "the collision of quantum wave packets with width @xmath0 was considered .",
    "their result is that if @xmath427 , the higher - curvature correction is small and the predictions by general relativity are reliable .",
    "the latter inequality @xmath428 was imposed by the expectation that the gravitational field of such a wave packet would be sufficiently close to that of the as particle and thus the ah would form in a collision of such two wave packets .",
    "our result of the ( 0 ) case , i.e. the collision of two identical @xmath1gyratons , explicitly demonstrates the accuracy of this expectation .",
    "moreover , because we found the ah also for @xmath429 , the condition can be relaxed to @xmath430 .",
    "note that this criterion holds also for wave packets of spinning particles , if their energy is sufficiently large , @xmath431 .",
    "our results of the ( 2_a _ ) and ( 2_b _ ) cases , i.e. the collisions of two identical spinning _",
    "a_ and _ b_ gyratons , show that @xmath201 is necessary for the ah formation for small @xmath0 . restoring the length unit and adopting @xmath422 ,",
    "it is rewritten as @xmath432 .",
    "however this does not provide a new condition since the original condition @xmath433 implies @xmath432 for @xmath431 .",
    "therefore , our results do not contradict the claims in @xcite .",
    "the important remaining problems are as follows .",
    "the first one is to explore the case @xmath107 further .",
    "this is because the condition of the black hole formation is expected to be different from that of the ah formation . in the case",
    "@xmath106 , however , the critical value of @xmath39 for the black hole formation will remain finite , because both the gravitational field generated by the spin source and the spin - spin interaction are repulsive . on the other hand , in the case @xmath107 , the repulsive gravitational field of each incoming gyraton is weakened and becomes even attractive in some part of the spacetime by the spin - spin interaction as shown in sec .",
    "hence , there is the possibility that later the gravitational field turns to be attractive everywhere and the critical value of @xmath39 blows up .",
    "the next problem is the collision of gyratons with a nonzero impact parameter . in these grazing collisions , new effects of the spin - orbit interaction",
    "will appear .",
    "moreover , the properties of spin - spin interaction might change .",
    "let us recall eq .  , the acceleration @xmath251 due to the spin - spin interaction between weakly gravitating bodies . in the grazing collisions , the spins are orthogonal to the relative location vector and @xmath251",
    "is calculated as @xmath434 .",
    "therefore in the aligned ( resp .",
    "anti - aligned ) case , the spin - spin interaction becomes attractive ( resp .",
    "repulsive ) , which is opposite to the head - on collision case .",
    "therefore it is expected that the nonzero impact parameter would make the interactions more complicated but more interesting .",
    "it is also important to simulate the collision of gyratons with realistic sources . in this paper",
    ", we assumed that each incoming gyraton has a singular source , eqs .   and , and studied only the spacetime regime where the matter interaction is not important ( i.e. , @xmath248 in sec .",
    "v ) . in a realistic situation , however , the source of an incoming gyraton is a beam pulse with a finite radius @xmath435 .",
    "then , the matter interaction determines the spacetime structure within the lightcone of the source collision , and the condition for the black hole formation will depend on the properties of matter interaction . in order to study this effect",

    "<S> the gyraton model describes a gravitational field of an object moving with the velocity of light which has finite energy and spin distributed during some finite time interval @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> a gyraton may be considered as a classical toy model for a quantum wave packet of high - energy particles with spin . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study a head - on collision of two gyratons and black hole formation in this process . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of this study is to understand the role of the gravitational spin - spin interaction in the process of mini black hole formation in particle collisions . to simplify the problem we consider several gyraton models with special profiles of the energy and spin density distribution . </S>",
    "<S> for these models we study the apparent horizon ( ah ) formation on the future edge of a spacetime region before interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the ah forms only if the energy duration and the spin are smaller than some critical values , while the length of the spin distribution should be at least of the order of the system gravitational radius . </S>",
    "<S> we also study gravitational spin - spin interaction in the head - on collision of two gyratons under the assumption that the values of gyraton spins are small . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the metric in the interaction region for such gyratons depends on the relative helicities of incoming gyratons , and the collision of gyratons with oppositely directed spins allows the ah formation in a larger parameter region than in the collision of the gyratons with the same direction of spins . </S>",
    "<S> some applications of the obtained results to the mini black hole production at the large hadron collider in tev gravity scenarios are briefly discussed . </S>"
