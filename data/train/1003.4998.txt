    "ultracompact ( uc ) h  ii  regions have radii @xmath0  pc and high radio surface brightness @xcite .",
    "they have a characteristic distribution of morphologies @xcite , and usually are found associated with one another and with compact h  ii  regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) can reflect a transition from optically thin to optically thick emission , but often show an anomalous intermediate wavelength dependence @xcite .",
    "recent radio continuum observations have suggested that ultracompact h  ii  regions can contract , change in shape , or expand anisotropically over intervals of as little as @xmath1 10  yr @xcite .",
    "the observed brightness and size of uc h  ii  regions require that they be ionized by massive stars of spectral type earlier than b3 .",
    "if the regions were to expand at the sound speed of ionized gas , @xmath2  km / s , they would have lifetimes of roughly @xmath3  yr .",
    "less than 1% of an ob star s lifetime of a few million years should therefore be spent within such a region , so the same fraction of ob stars should now lie within them .",
    "however , surveys find numbers in our galaxy consistent with over 10% of ob stars being surrounded by them @xcite , or equivalently , lifetimes of @xmath4  yr if this model is correct .",
    "a number of explanations have been proposed for this lifetime problem , including confinement in cloud cores by thermal pressure @xcite or turbulent pressure @xcite , ram pressure confinement by infall @xcite or bow shocks @xcite , champagne flows @xcite , disk evaporation @xcite , and mass - loaded stellar winds @xcite , but most have been argued to have major flaws @xcite .",
    "we have modeled accretion on to an ionizing source using three - dimensional simulations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) .",
    "these calculations suggest that accretion can indeed explain the lifetime problem , but in an unexpected way .",
    "@xcite has argued that ultracompact and hypercompact h  ii  regions are simply the ionized portion of an accretion flow .",
    "however , massive stars require accretion at rates exceeding @xmath5  m@xmath6  yr@xmath7 @xcite to reach their final masses before exhausting their nuclear fuel @xcite .",
    "the result is gravitational instability during collapse , leading to the formation of dense gas filaments in the rotating , collapsing flow , along with dozens of accompanying stars ( paper i ) .",
    "the strongest sources of ionizing radiation orbit through the dense filaments repeatedly , accreting mass efficiently when they do .",
    "the filaments absorb the ionizing radiation locally , though , when this happens , shielding the rest of the h  ii  region for long enough for it to recombine . as a result ,",
    "the size of the observed h  iiregion remains independent of the age of the ionizing star until the surrounding secondary star formation cuts off accretion on to the primary and a compact h  ii  region begins to grow around it .    in this paper",
    "we consider in more detail than in paper  i whether our models of ionization interacting with a gravitationally unstable accretion flow can reproduce the observations of ultracompact h  iiregions summarized at the beginning of this section .",
    "we show how h  iiregions fluctuate in size as their central stars pass through density fluctuations , and demonstrate that our models qualitatively reproduce all morphologies observed for ultracompact h  ii  regions , even giving general quantitative agreement with the distribution of different morphologies observed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our models also offer a natural explanation for the observed clustering of ultracompact h  ii  regions .",
    "we further demonstrate that they reproduce observed seds , and provide natural explanations for the anomalous seds observed for some ultracompact h  ii  regions @xcite .    in sect .",

    "we present three - dimensional , gas dynamic , simulations with radiation feedback from ionizing and non - ionizing radiation .",
    "we use the flash adaptive - mesh code @xcite , modified to include a hybrid - characteristics raytracing method @xcite to solve the radiative transfer problem .",
    "the protostars are modeled by sink particles @xcite that are coupled to the radiation module via a protostellar model ( paper i ) .",
    "we simulate the collapse of a massive core with a mass of @xmath8 .",
    "the core has constant density within the sphere with @xmath9pc , while further out the density falls off as @xmath10 .",
    "the gas temperature is initially @xmath11k .",
    "the core begins in solid body rotation with a ratio of rotational to gravitational energy @xmath12 .",
    "we use an adaptive mesh with a cell size at the highest refinement level of @xmath13au . sink particles",
    "are inserted at a cut - off density of @xmath14g@xmath15 and accrete all gas above @xmath16 within an accretion radius of @xmath17au if it is gravitationally bound to the particle .",
    "we analyze two simulations . in the first simulation ( run a ) , we only follow the evolution of a single star and suppress the formation of any secondary stars .",
    "we do this by introducing a dynamical temperature floor @xmath18 with newton s constant @xmath19 , mean molecular weight @xmath20 , boltzmann s constant @xmath21 , local gas density @xmath22 , and cell size @xmath23 .",
    "this temperature floor guarantees that the jeans length is always resolved with @xmath24 cells",
    ". we must set @xmath25 to prevent artificial fragmentation @xcite . in the second simulation ( run b )",
    ", we do not apply the temperature floor , instead allowing the formation of secondary sink particles .",
    "more details on the simulation method as well as a detailed description of the simulation results can be found in paper i.      radio continuum emission from h  ii  regions around massive stars at wavelengths @xmath26 cm ( @xmath27hz ) is predominantly caused by free - free emission from ionized hydrogen @xcite . since scattering can be neglected for this problem @xcite , the equation of radiative transfer can be readily integrated .",
    "first , we calculate the free - free absorption coefficient of atomic hydrogen @xmath28 with number density of free electrons @xmath29 , electron temperature @xmath30 and frequency @xmath31 .",
    "since the electrons thermalize quickly @xcite , we can take the gas temperature @xmath32 .",
    "given the absorption coefficient , the optical depth at distance @xmath33 from the edge of the domain is then @xmath34 the radiative transfer equation in the rayleigh - jeans limit then leads to the brightness temperature @xmath35 the resulting map of brightness temperatures can be converted to flux densities with the solid angle subtended by the beam @xmath36 of the telescope via @xmath37 following the algorithm described in @xcite , we convolve the resulting image with the beam width and add some noise according to the telescope parameters .",

    "we now compute the dust temperature using the monte carlo method .",
    "we do this in two ways .",
    "first , we use a spherical 1d grid , similar to what we use for transphere .",

    "our simulations follow the gravitational collapse of the initial massive clump and lead to the formation of high - mass stars .",
    "the collapse leads to the formation of a massive rotationally flattened structure , which is gravitationally unstable and fragments .",
    "only a single star is allowed to form in run a. it accretes @xmath89 in @xmath90kyr . in run",
    "b , three high - mass stars with @xmath91 form within @xmath92kyr , and become the dominant source of ionizing radiation within the star cluster .",
    "the interaction of the ionizing radiation with the infalling accretion flow leads to multiple effects observable in both spatial and spectral diagnostics .",
    "the most striking property of the resulting h  ii  regions is their extremely high variability in time and shape . in the online material of paper i we presented movies of radio continuum maps from different viewpoints .",
    "the radio maps were generated for vla parameters at a wavelength of @xmath93 cm , using a beam with full width at half maximum of @xmath94 and a noise level of @xmath95jy .",
    "the assumed distance was @xmath96kpc .",
    "all the movies show the continuous build - up and destruction of uc  h  iiregions .",
    "the timescale for changes of more than @xmath97  au in size can be as short as @xmath98yr .",
    "this flickering is caused by the accretion flow in which the sources are embedded .",
    "when the protostar passes through dense , gravitationally unstable filaments in the accretion flow , they absorb its ionizing radiation , so that the gas above the filament recombines and cools down .",
    "since the gravitational instabilities cause the accretion flow to be chaotic , the interplay between the radiation feedback and the infalling material results in highly stochastic ionization and recombination processes in the surrounding gas .    this effect is demonstrated in figure  [ changes ] .",
    "it shows dramatic changes in the h  ii  region around the most massive star in run b. between @xmath99myr and @xmath100myr ( within @xmath101  yr ) , a region with a diameter of @xmath102au suddenly recombines .",
    "changes like this not only affect the physical size of the h  ii  region , but they can also alter their morphology . from @xmath103myr to @xmath104myr ( again within @xmath101  yr ) , the morphology of the uc  h  ii  region surrounding the most massive protostar changes from shell - like to core - halo because of a large - scale recombination event that clears the rim of the shell .",
    "the shielding by the filaments also controls how ionizing radiation can escape perpendicular to the disk .",
    "for example , this reverses the cometary h  ii  region around the star between @xmath105myr and @xmath106myr ( within @xmath107  yr ) .",
    "the three examples given in figure  [ changes ] indicate that the morphology of ultracompact h  ii  regions around accreting massive protostars depends sensitively on accretion events close to the protostar .",
    "the flickering observed in the simulations also resolves the long - standing lifetime problem for uc  h  ii  regions @xcite .",
    "since uc  h  ii  regions are not freely expanding bubbles of gas that monotonically increase in size , their diameter does not depend on their age .",
    "an extreme version of the discrepancy between protostellar mass and size of the h  ii  region occurs in run a , where the @xmath108 protostar has almost no visible h  ii  region .",
    "it is totally quenched by the strong accretion flow .",
    "while the source in run a never stops accreting , the most massive stars in run b finally stop growing when the gas reservoir around them is fully exploited .",
    "as the density surrounding the most massive star then drops , the hot , ionized gas can finally expand monotonicially , eventually overrunning the second most massive star as well .",
    "once there is no more high - density gas in its neighborhood , the flickering around the most massive star stops .",
    "the ionized gas continues to expand , forming a compact h  ii  region with larger size and fainter emission than the preceding ultracompact phase .",
    "we stress that it is not the ionizing radiation that stops the accretion flow by driving away the surrounding gas , rather it is the subsiding accretion flow that allows the ionized gas to expand .",
    "we call this process fragmentation - induced starvation , a more detailed discussion of which we presented in paper i.          the extended h  ii  regions found in the simulations display a large amount of substructure .",
    "equation   shows that the emission from free - free transitions scales with the square of the number density of free electrons , @xmath29 .",
    "this explains the emission peak close to the protostar , where very dense gas in the accretion flow gets partially ionized .",
    "however , not all emission peaks are associated with stars .",
    "figure  [ emission ] shows some examples .",
    "the upper left panel ( a@xmath109 ) shows an h  ii  region with a shell - like structure .",
    "the shell clearly exhibits a peak on its rim that is several @xmath110au away from any nearby star .",
    "the shell is created by dense shocks running through the h  ii  region , which are replenished by material from the accretion flow .",
    "the emission of this dense gas is what creates the shell .",
    "another example is shown in the lower left panel ( a@xmath111 ) of figure  [ emission ] .",
    "it shows a dense blob of gas that is externally irradiated by a massive star and creates a peak that appears to indicate the position of a second star .",
    "obviously , peaks in emission maps are not an ideal guide to the coordinates of stars .",
    "the aforementioned shocks contribute largely to the emission seen in the maps .",
    "the middle panels ( b@xmath109 ) and ( b@xmath111 ) in figure  [ emission ] show an edge - on view of the rotationally flattened structure of the star cluster .",
    "the upper panel ( b@xmath109 ) shows that the most massive star has created a cometary h  ii  region .",
    "the lower panel ( b@xmath111 ) displays the same region @xmath112yr later .",
    "the ionizing radiation has blown away gas from the accretion flow close to the protostar .",
    "this shock runs away from the star and creates a filament of strong emission across the h  ii  region .",
    "the right - hand plots ( c@xmath109 ) and ( c@xmath111 ) in figure  [ emission ] show the same region face - on . from this viewing angle ,",
    "the shock shows up as shell - like structure .",
    "this demonstrates that the shell does not trace the edge where the ionizing radiation hits the accretion disk , but rather shocks generated from inflowing gas .",
    "the shell - like structures around accreting protostars can be interpreted as indirect evidence for the accretion process .",
    "the origin of the shell morphology changes when accretion ceases .",
    "figure  [ bubble ] shows the late - stage evolution of the star cluster .",
    "the most massive star has stopped accreting , allowing its h  ii  region to begin to expand quickly into the ambient gas .",
    "the left - hand plots and show the expanding h  ii  region face - on in the upper panel ( a@xmath109 ) and edge - on in the lower panel ( a@xmath111 ) .",
    "here , the strong shell - like emission clearly comes from the dense gas in the rotationally flattened structure around the protostar rather than from a shock launched by the protostar .    while the accretion onto the most massive star has stopped and can not directly affect the structure of the growing h  ii  region any more , it can still be influenced by other stars that interact with the gas .",
    "two such events occur in run b and are shown in figure  [ bubble ] .",
    "the middle panels ( b@xmath109 ) and ( b@xmath111 ) show a time sequence of a @xmath113 star approaching the rim of the shell .",
    "its ionizing radiation is strong enough to create sufficient thermal pressure to blow away the rim of the shell from its direct neighborhood .",
    "the right - hand panels ( b@xmath114 ) and ( b@xmath115 ) show the same star @xmath116yr later , when it has already entered the compact h  ii  region .",
    "now its ionizing radiation can freely expand .",
    "the gravitational attraction of the star is strong enough to pull along a dense stream of gas .",
    "this stream allows the star to grow in mass although it has entered the h  ii  region filled with underdense gas .",
    "this suggests that deformed shells could be indicative of stars inside large - scale h  ii  regions .",
    "the simulation data presented here offer the unique opportunity to look at the same h  ii  region from different viewing angles .",
    "we have already seen that the observed morphology depends crucially on the position of the observer .",
    "we investigate this observation in detail for some h  ii  regions appearing in run b.    figure  [ rotation1 ] displays an h  ii  region around the most massive star in run b. the first panel ( a@xmath109 ) shows the region face - on , and the successive panels show the region rotated around an axis in the plane of the rotationally flattened structure by @xmath117 increments until a rotation of @xmath118 is reached .",
    "hence , the last panel ( a@xmath119 ) shows the region edge - on .",
    "this sequence of images demonstrates that a region with a shell - like morphology from one viewing angle can have a cometary morphology from a different viewing angle .",
    "the transition angle at which the shell - like morphology turns into a cometary morphology is about @xmath120 in this particular case .",
    "the online material for this article contains a movie of the volume - rendered ( logarithmic ) absorption coefficient of this region along with the corresponding synthetic vla image as the line of sight is rotating , illustrating the complex structure of the ionized gas in the h  ii  region , and how it determines the morphology , depending on the viewing angle .    because the ultracompact h  ii",
    "region shape is asymmetric , we get a different result if we perform the rotation around a different axis .",
    "figure  [ rotation2 ] starts with the last frame ( a@xmath119 ) of figure  [ rotation1 ] and successively rotates the region by @xmath118 around the polar axis .",
    "this means that the view is edge - on for all times . at an angle around @xmath121 ,",
    "the cometary region develops strong shell - like structures .",
    "we already know that these filaments have their origin in gas blown away by the protostar .",
    "this region is of shell - like type since it is bounded by a dense filament .",
    "this means that shell - like regions can occur both at face - on and at edge - on view . in principle , the same holds true for cometary regions .",
    "they can also be observed face - on when the ionizing radiation is shielded anisotropically .",
    "we have repeated the same exercise for different h  ii  regions and find that the transition angle between shell - like and cometary morphologies shows no systematic behavior .",
    "figure  [ rotation3 ] shows two more rotations from face - on to edge - on .",
    "we show only the first and last images as well as the transition angle .",
    "the upper panels ( a@xmath109 ) to ( a@xmath114 ) show the transformation of a shell - like morphology into a cometary morphology at @xmath122myr , the lower panels ( b@xmath109 ) to ( b@xmath114 ) show a similar transition at @xmath123myr .",
    "the central star has a mass of @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively .",
    "the transition angle is about @xmath121 in the former and @xmath126 in the latter case .",
    "they depend on the details of the structure .",
    "a universal angle above which transition occurs does not exist .",
    "morphologies of uc  h  ii  regions were classified by @xcite and @xcite as shell , cometary , core - halo , spherical , irregular and unresolved .",
    "@xcite abandoned the core - halo morphology and introduced a new bipolar category for elongated h  ii  regions .",
    "they argued for abandoning the core - halo type because most h  ii  regions are surrounded by faint emission , which produces a halo around any h  ii  region .",
    "though this may be true , we find it useful to keep this morphological type for regions with a pronounced central peak and a fainter envelope .",
    "the presence of a pronounced envelope clearly distinguishes this morphology from the spherical type , which we also find .",
    "in addition , we do not require shell - like regions to be void of central peaks . although the larger , late - time shells do indeed not have central peaks , the uc  h  ii  regions associated with accreting protostars do have central peaks because they ionize their own accretion flow .",
    "in fact , observations with high sensitivity and resolution do find centrally peaked shells that were previously classified as spherical @xcite .",
    "we predict that more regions of this type will be found as observations with better resolution and sensitivity also become available for more distant massive star forming regions .",
    "figure  [ distance ] demonstrates the importance of resolution and sensitivity in identifying the correct morphology .",
    "the figure shows synthetic maps of the same shell - like h  ii  region for vla parameters at @xmath127 cm , placed at different distances to the observer .",
    "the shell disappears between @xmath128 and @xmath129kpc , where both the spatial resolution and the noise level make it impossible to distinguish between parts of the h  ii  region and pure noise . on the other hand",
    ", the number of centrally peaked shells seen in our simulations might be reduced by including additional feedback processes like line - driven stellar winds or magnetically driven outflows , which might be able to create a cavity around the protostar .",
    "if these processes would be strong enough to thin out the dense accretion flow sufficiently to remove the peaks remains an open question .",
    "the new bipolar type is not well defined .",
    "@xcite gave only one example for this new category , where the bipolar shape is not very distinctive .",
    "@xcite required an hourglass shape for the bipolar morphology , which is not present in their example .",
    "although we do find morphologies that look bipolar in the simulations , there are only very few of them , and their features are not very pronounced .",
    "the small number of bipolar regions is in agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "all of the bipolar regions could equally well fall into one of the other classes , which is why we do not take this category into account .",
    "the sensitive dependence on viewing angle and the high time variability of the h  ii  region caused by the accretion flow is sufficient to produce morphologies of any described type in a single simulation .",
    "figure  [ runamorph ] shows maps from run a with only one ionizing source .",
    "the displayed shell - like and core - halo morpholgies are face - on views , whereas the cometary h  ii  region is viewed edge - on .",
    "as discussed above , the same morphologies can equally well be obtained at different viewing angles .",
    "it is apparent that the size of the h  ii  region does not scale with the mass of the protostar . on the contrary",
    ", the irregular region corresponds to the largest protostar , but it is among the smallest h  ii  regions .          for comparison with the observational surveys by @xcite and @xcite , we perform a census of morphologies in run  a and run  b. we select 25 snapshots from each simulation and view each one from 20 randomly chosen angles .",
    "this gives a total of 500 images per simulation .",
    "the different viewing angles take into account the fact that because of the axisymmetric geometry of the initial conditions , some morphologies preferentially occur at different orientations .",
    "for example , shell - like morphologies are found mostly face - on , and cometary morphologies edge - on .",
    "the set of different viewing angles , uniformly distributed on the unit sphere around the center of the computational domain , avoids statistical biases by this effect . by the same token",
    ", the distribution of morphologies also changes with time . since many stars in run  b",
    "reach a mass of @xmath130 by the end of the simulation , the later times contain more spherical and unresolved h  ii  regions than the beginning of the simulation . since we do not know the geometry and the evolutionary stage of the uc  h  ii  regions in the surveys , we assume randomly distributed orientations and ages and thus average over different viewing angles and simulation snapshots to get a representative sample . we note that this somewhat overstates the contribution from later stages in our simulations , since with a standard imf there are probably far more star forming events that terminate with the formation of low - mass ob stars than higher - mass ones . to achieve consistency with the observational analysis techniques we use contour plots to identify the morphological classes and follow the definitions given in @xcite .    to guarantee that the viewing angles are distributed evenly on the sphere",
    ", we use a rejection method to calculate the random angles @xcite .",
    "we start with three random numbers @xmath131 with a uniform distribution on the interval @xmath132 $ ] .",
    "we then calculate the radius @xmath133 and drop all points with @xmath134 .",
    "the remaining points are projected onto the sphere , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 . the cartesian coordinates @xmath138 of the point on the unit sphere are then converted into spherical coordinates @xmath139 , resulting in the desired distribution of viewing angles .",
    "the results of our statistical analysis are presented in table  [ statistics ] .",
    "the numbers from run  b are taken from evaluations performed independently by the first four authors , so that we can give mean values and standard deviations for the relative frequencies .",
    "the standard deviations remained small in absolute terms , never exceeding five percentage points , although some are large in relative terms , particularly for the rarer types .    given the variation amongst the observational surveys , the results from the multiple sink simulation run  b are quite consistent with the observational numbers . in particular , we find that roughly half of the sample represents spherical or unresolved uc  h  ii  regions , in agreement with the classical lifetime problem .",
    "conversely , the results show that the relative numbers of spherical and unresolved h  ii  regions in run  a disagree by more than @xmath44 percentage points with the observational findings .",
    "this result clearly disagrees with theoretical models in which massive stars form alone .",
    "since the protostar in run  a grows very quickly , it can not generate such a large number of strongly confined h  ii  regions .",
    "instead , lots of irregular h  ii  regions form .",
    "the only way to get a large number of spherical and unresolved h  ii  regions is the formation of a stellar cluster .",
    "this again shows that run  b is a much more realistic model for massive star formation .",

    ", we can investigate how morphological features of h  ii  regions depend on the optical depth .",
    "as an example , we examine in detail the h  ii  region from the upper panels ( a@xmath109 ) to ( a@xmath114 ) of figure  [ rotation3 ] at @xmath122myr around a @xmath124 star in run  b.    figure  [ multifreq ] shows synthetic vla observations for wavelengths from @xmath141 cm to @xmath142 cm assuming a distance of @xmath96kpc ( see tab .  [ vla ] ) .",
    "the beam width decreases with wavelength , so that the h  ii  region is increasingly better resolved .",
    "the corresponding images of optical depth are shown in figure  [ multifreqtau ] . in agreement with the expected behavior evident from equation  ,",
    "the optical depth decreases with decreasing wavelength .",
    "the broad peak at @xmath141 cm appears not only because of the large beam , but also because the whole h  ii  region is optically thick . at @xmath143 cm ,",
    "only the right - hand side of the h  ii  region is optically thick , as is clearly visible in the vla observation . at @xmath144 cm ,",
    "only a small region around the protostar and in an arc - like feature is optically thick , which leads to a shell - like h  ii  region .",
    "the vla maps at @xmath49 and @xmath127 cm look similar , but at the smaller wavelength the shell is not optically thick anymore .",
    "the one - to - one correspondence between emission features and optically thick regions breaks at @xmath127 cm . for @xmath55 and @xmath142 cm",
    ", the optically thick region around the protostar disappears .",
    "the shell is still visible at these wavelengths .              at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths one generally expects to observe dust emission along with the free - free emission",
    "this is not the case for the rather low mass core in the model presented here .",
    "since the total initial gas mass in our model is only @xmath110m@xmath145 , there is less than @xmath129m@xmath145 of dust in the whole domain during the simulation , under the assumption of a canonical gas - to - dust ratio of 100 .",
    "this is not enough to produce any observable emission , because the free - free radiation is much stronger .",
    "hence , the simulated alma maps of this model show only free - free emission , but not dust .    we can estimate the maximum flux due to dust emission as follows .",
    "let @xmath146 be the total dust mass , @xmath147 the distance to the source , @xmath148 the dust opacity and @xmath149 the black - body spectrum for the temperature @xmath150 .",
    "then the total flux from all dust is approximately @xmath151 to arrive at an estimate for the upper limit of @xmath152 , we set @xmath153kpc , @xmath154m@xmath145 , @xmath155k and @xmath156@xmath157g@xmath7 at @xmath158ghz ( @xmath159 mm ) .",
    "this yields @xmath160jy or , assuming an uc  h  ii  region with @xmath161pc diameter , @xmath162mjy@xmath163beam for an effective beam width of @xmath164arcsec .",
    "this is only a factor of @xmath165 larger than the noise level for a @xmath129min integration time of this alma band ( see table  [ alma ] ) , which is @xmath166mjy .",
    "though this calculation demonstrates that the small amount of dust in our simulation would already be very faint when free - free emission was absent , what really makes the dust emission invisible is its weakness compared to free - free emission ( see also section  [ sec : seds ] ) , which is independent of the telescope sensitivity .",
    "we caution , however , that the above calculation assumes a homogeneous distribution of dust across the h  ii  region .",
    "this treatment neglects dust emission from an accretion disk around the massive star , which we can not resolve in our simulation and may produce significant dust emission . in our numerical example , alma would be able to resolve these disks , if they exist , and detect their dust emission .",
    "a similar argument holds for disks around low - mass stars that are being exposed to ionizing radiation from a neighboring high - mass star , which may life long enough to be observed @xcite .",
    "this caveat also applies to the spectral energy distributions in the submillimeter regime ( see section  [ sec : seds ] ) .",
    "we demonstrate the absence of dust emission in figure  [ almapic ] with the h  ii  region shown in figure  [ multifreq ] .",
    "the bright shell that was visible at vla wavelengths completely disappears as the wavelength gets shorter . instead",
    ", bright spots directly at the location of the massive stars appear .",
    "this emission is caused by partially ionized , dense gas of the accretion flow around these massive stars .",
    "none of the images shows any appreciable dust emission .",
    "a useful diagnostic of uc  h  ii  regions is their integrated sed . for a medium at constant temperature ,",
    "the integral in equation   for the brightness temperature leads to @xmath167 in the frequency regime where the emission is dominated by free - free , equations   and show that the flux @xmath152 of a homogeneous source typically grows as @xmath168 in the optically thick regime ( small frequencies ) and falls off like @xmath169 in the optically thin regime ( large frequencies ) . for typical emission measures of @xmath170pc @xmath171 , the transition frequency",
    "for which @xmath172 is @xmath173ghz .",
    "this turnover frequency depends only weakly on the emission measure , @xmath174 .    however , many observed seds of h  ii  regions do not behave in this simple manner but show anomalous scaling exponents @xcite . in particular , there are seds that grow linearly with @xmath31 over a frequency interval that can be as large as the whole vla range ( see table  [ vla ] )",
    ". such anomalous scaling exponents can be reproduced by h  ii  region models with ionized gradients @xcite , hierarchical clumps @xcite and additional dust emission @xcite .",
    "the data from our numerical simulations is certainly more realistic than the simple ionized gradient or hierarchical clump models .",
    "therefore it is reassuring that we can reproduce the typical shapes of observed seds .",
    "we show two examples in figure  [ seds ] .",
    "the left - hand sed shows the full coverage from vla over alma to iras frequencies for the h  ii  region of figures  [ multifreq ] and [ almapic ] .",
    "the seds show the typical shape of those reported in @xcite .",
    "as already noted above , the free - free radiation is by far dominant up to alma frequencies . for iras frequencies , however , dust emission is the dominant process .",
    "the right - hand sed shows another example that more nicely illustrates the typical scaling behavior expected for the free - free emission .",
    "the dotted lines grow @xmath175 , the dashed lines fall off @xmath176 .",
    "one example of an sed with an anomalous scaling @xmath177 ( solid line ) is shown in figure  [ sedsabn ] .",
    "the result can be a combined effect of density gradients in the ionized gas as well as shadowing by clumps , just as in the simpler analytical models .",
    "we do not need any dust to produce anomalous exponents , and in fact in our particular model , the dust emission is so low that it is unable to produce such gradients .",
    "hence , our simulations reproduce both the general shape of h  ii  regions seds as well as the observed anomalous scaling behavior entirely with the computed distribution of ionized gas .",
    "and the dashed lines scale @xmath176 .",
    "the agreement of the free - free emission with the expected power laws is different for the two regions .",
    "dust emission is visible only in the iras range .",
    "missing crosses representing dust emission are below the flux range shown in the image .",
    "the assumed distance for both seds is @xmath178kpc.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and the dashed lines scale @xmath176 .",

    "the free - free emission of this region grows anomalously with a spectral index around unity across the full vla and most of the alma coverage .",
    "this scaling is produced solely by density inhomogeneities , not by dust emission .",
    "missing crosses representing dust emission are below the flux range shown in the image .",
    "the assumed distance is @xmath178kpc . ]",
    "we have presented synthetic continuum observations of the h  iiregions formed in our collapse simulations of massive star formation described in paper  i. we find that the h  ii  regions are highly variable in size and shape as long as the massive star continues accreting .",
    "dense filaments in the gravitationally unstable accretion flow irregularly shield ionizing radiation from the central star .",
    "this shielding effect leads to a large - scale ( @xmath179au ) flickering of the h  ii  regions on timescales as short as @xmath180yr .",
    "as long as the flickering continues , there is no direct relation between the age of the star and the size of the h  ii  region .",
    "this result appears able to resolve the uc  h  ii  lifetime problem .",
    "furthermore , we have identified the structures inside the h  ii  regions that produce the continuum emission .",
    "we find that emission peaks are not necesarily related to the positions of stars .",
    "instead , strong emission is produced by partially ionized gas from the accretion flow that enters the h  ii  region .",
    "these filaments can be ionized and blown away by thermal pressure .",
    "since the continuum emission is determined solely by the structure of the flow field around the massive star , the appearance of the h  ii  region depends strongly on the angle from which it is viewed .",
    "for example , we find that the same h  ii  region can be classified as shell - like or cometary , depending on the position of the observer .",
    "we have evaluated the distribution of apparent h  ii  region morphologies .",
    "the multiple sink simulation run  b reproduces the observed relative frequencies reported from surveys , including the high fraction of spherical or unresolved regions .",
    "the single sink simulation run  a , however , fails to reproduce the morphology statistics .",
    "this is because the single star grows so quickly that it is statistically unable to produce a significant fraction of the smallest h  ii  regions .",
    "the formation of a whole stellar cluster is necessary to get the relative frequencies of the smallest h  iiregions right .",
    "this analysis provides strong evidence against models of massive star formation where all or most high - mass stars form in isolation .",
    "in addition to the h  ii  region morphologies , we can also reproduce the different seds characteristic of uc  h  ii  regions . we find that our initial gas mass of @xmath181 is too small to produce observable dust emission at vla or alma wavelengths .",
    "nevertheless , ultracompact h  ii  regions at different times and places in our models show seds with both regular transitions from optically thick to optically thin spectral slopes as well as anomalous scaling with a spectral slope around unity .",
    "these slopes are entirely produced by inhomogeneities in the density structure , with no contribution from dust .",
    "however , follow - up simulations with more massive initial clumps will be required to completely pin down the role of dust in observed seds .",
