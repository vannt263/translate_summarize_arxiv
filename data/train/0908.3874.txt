    "angular momentum transport is a key to the evolution of protostellar disks and the origins of the planets , as it governs the flow of raw materials toward the star @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the stresses due to large - scale magnetic fields driving an outflow @xcite or shearing within the disk @xcite .",
    "all of the magnetic angular momentum transport processes require the gas is sufficiently ionized to couple to the fields .",
    "collisional ionization leads to good coupling only at the temperatures above 1000  k found very close to the star @xcite . in the overwhelming majority of the disk volume , the main ionization processes are non - thermal . among the important non - thermal processes are the x - rays emitted by the young star @xcite , the cosmic rays arriving from interstellar space @xcite , and the decay of radionuclides within the gas @xcite",
    "the basic difficulties in reaching high enough levels of ionization through these non - thermal processes are the large column of absorbing material and the high rate of recombination on the surfaces of dust particles .",
    "the x - rays and cosmic rays generally penetrate and ionize only the surface layers of the disk , leaving a region near the midplane where magnetic activity is suppressed @xcite .",
    "the absorption of x - rays and cosmic rays in the atmosphere means that the disk can be divided into three zones . in the upper layers , and in outer annuli where the mass column is low enough for the ionizing radiation to reach the midplane , the magnetic fields couple thoroughly to the gas , and magnetic forces drive turbulence through the mri . in a `` dead zone '' near the midplane , the fields decouple from the gas , and magnetic forces are largely irrelevant . at resistivities between these extremes ,",
    "magnetic fields decouple over scales comparable to the disk thickness , shutting off the mri , but remain coupled over the disk radius .",
    "the radial gradient in orbital frequency can then shear out any weak radial magnetic field to generate toroidal fields , enabling angular momentum transport to continue @xcite .",
    "the turbulent surface layers are thus separated from the midplane dead zone by an `` undead zone '' that becomes magnetically active when supplied with radial fields .    in this paper",
    "we explore whether three less well - studied additional sources of ionization can reduce the sizes of the dead and undead zones or make protostellar disks magnetically active throughout .",
    "the three ionization sources are high - energy particles from ( 1 ) a nearby supernova explosion @xcite , ( 2 ) the corona of the protostellar disk itself , and ( 3 ) the young star .",
    "we estimate the ionization rates to order of magnitude (  [ sec : ionization ] ) and calculate the resulting resistivities (  [ sec : chemistry ] ) in the minimum - mass model of the protosolar disk (  [ sec : disk ] ) , finding the undead and dead zones shown in  [ sec : deadzone ] . a summary and conclusions",

    "the base ionization rate in our calculations is set by the x - rays emitted from the vicinity of the young star (  [ sec : xrays ] ) .",
    "some of the models include also the decay of radioactive isotopes within the disk (  [ sec : radionuclides ] ) .",
    "our purpose is to explore the additional effects of energetic protons from three sources : the interstellar medium (  [ sec : cr ] ) , the disk corona (  [ sec : diskcorona ] ) , and the stellar corona (  [ sec : stellarcorona ] ) . with the aim of determining whether the dead zone can be removed under favorable circumstances ,",
    "we generally err on the high side in estimating the proton fluxes .",
    "the rates of ionization from the five processes are compared in  [ sec : compared ] .",
    "the x - ray ionization is included because almost all lightly - obscured young solar - mass stars in the orion nebula show x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the measured spread in luminosity is several decades , with a median around @xmath1  erg  s@xmath2 .",

    "short - lived radionuclides , primarily @xmath16al ( half - life 0.717  myr ) , yield an ionization rate @xmath17  s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the results of our calculations change little if we use instead the rates advocated by @xcite , which differ from these by between 9% and 55% .",
    "the radionuclide ionization rates will be substantially lower if the dust particles containing most of the heavy elements are absent . in some cases without grains",
    "we include no radionuclide ionization , while in others the rate is reduced @xmath18-fold from the dusty calculations to account for the possibility that a small amount of the radioactive element occurs in the gas phase .",
    "the first of three energetic proton sources we consider is the interstellar cosmic rays .",
    "particles with energies above 0.1  gev provide most of the ionizing effect at high mass columns @xcite .",

    "lacking good information about the degree to which the protosolar wind screened the inner protosolar disk from interstellar cosmic rays , and seeking a lower bound on the size of the undead and dead zones , we assume that the cosmic rays above 0.1  gev reach the disk surface with the interstellar flux and energy spectrum .",
    "a supernova explosion occurring within 10  pc of the young star could increase the cosmic ray energy density by about three orders of magnitude over the general interstellar value , based on the energetic - particle populations inferred from gamma - ray observations of supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider below the effects of a thousand - fold increase in the cosmic ray ionization rate .",
    "the second energetic proton source we consider is the atmosphere of the accretion disk itself .",
    "forbidden optical line emission and central balmer absorptions in the spectra of t  tauri stars indicate the presence of low - density overlying gas with temperatures in the range @xmath25 to @xmath18  k @xcite similar to the solar chromosphere .",
    "models of the heating and cooling balance show that such temperatures can be produced by the stellar ultraviolet and x - ray irradiation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , many t  tauri disks produce winds with speeds of 10 to 100  km  s@xmath2 @xcite , typically surrounding a faster central jet .",
    "since magnetic forces likely drive the winds , we assume below that the alfvn speeds approach the escape speed in the extended atmospheres of the disks .    under similar conditions in the solar chromosphere and corona , fast magnetic reconnection and shocks",
    "lead to the acceleration of protons to high energies , as reviewed by @xcite .",
    "fast reconnection requires plasma in the hall regime , so that the whistler or kinetic alfvn driving waves are not dissipated @xcite .",
    "the electron - ion collision frequency @xmath26 must be less than the electron cyclotron frequency @xmath27 . in the atmosphere of the disk around a young solar - mass star , the ratio of the two frequencies is @xmath28 using expressions from @xcite with the coulomb logarithm set to  10 .",
    "fast reconnection can thus occur in the tenuous disk atmosphere .",
    "reconnection in the dense , cold disk interior presumably is due to the slower sweet - parker mechanism .",
    "reconnection in the solar corona produces a mix of thermal and non - thermal particles .",
    "the temperature of the thermal component is such that the downstream gas pressure is approximately equal to the upstream magnetic pressure .",
    "similar conversion of magnetic energy to heat in the disk corona yields the virial temperature @xmath29 .",
    "reconnection can thus plausibly contribute to the heating and stirring indicated by the central balmer absorptions @xcite and by the doppler - broadened emission line of ionized neon at 12.8  @xmath30 m in tw  hydrae @xcite .",
    "the thermal particles do not affect the dead zone as they have little penetrating power .",
    "the maximum energy of the non - thermal particles is approximately equal to the product of the particle charge @xmath31 , the electric field strength , and the length over which the particles are accelerated .",
    "the electric field @xmath32 is proportional to the reconnection speed @xmath33 , which we set equal to the alfvn speed @xmath34 .",
    "the lengths of magnetic loops in the disk corona depend on the rate of reconnection relative to shear @xcite .",
    "when shear dominates , loops may reach sizes comparable to the radius @xmath4 , which we choose as the acceleration distance .",
    "the maximum energy of the particles produced during reconnection @xmath35 so the high - energy tail extends into the regime of penetrating cosmic rays above @xmath36  gev .",
    "the luminosity of the particles accelerated by reconnection in the disk corona is bounded above by the rate of gravitational energy release due to accretion .",
    "the accretion energy per unit area and unit time leaving each side of the disk around a young solar analog t  tauri star is about @xmath37yr@xmath38 times the energy flux in ordinary interstellar cosmic rays , where @xmath39 is the mass flow rate .",
    "much of the accretion flux takes the form of thermal radiation from the disk photosphere , while some fraction is in magnetic fields that rise into the corona before dissipating .",
    "results from shearing - box mhd calculations @xcite suggest the fraction is of order 10% .",
    "some part of the coronal magnetic energy is converted through reconnection and shocks into the kinetic energy of non - thermal protons .",
    "we assume the proportion is similar to the contemporary sun , where magnetic energy is dissipated at approximately @xmath40 erg  s@xmath2 , judging from the mean x - ray luminosity .",
    "the sun and solar wind produce a flux at 1  au of about one proton with energy exceeding 0.1  gev , per square centimeter per second , comparable to the interstellar cosmic ray flux outside the heliosphere , according to data from the goes satellite energetic particle sensors @xcite and to analyses of tracks produced in lunar rocks over the past few million years @xcite .",
    "the corresponding solar luminosity in particles above 0.1  gev is around @xmath41 erg  s@xmath2 , or 0.1% of the rate of dissipation of magnetic energy .",
    "we thus infer that the overall fraction of the disk accretion energy that rises into the corona in the form of magnetic fields and is converted to energetic protons is @xmath42 .",
    "perhaps half the particles travel downward and strike the disk surface , yielding an ionisation rate @xmath43 that is @xmath44 times the demodulated interstellar cosmic ray value .      the third source of energetic protons we consider is the corona and inner wind of the young sun .",
    "the contemporary sun accelerates ions to cosmic ray energies .",
    "the reconnection of opposing magnetic fields with alfvn speed @xmath34 produces ions of mass @xmath45 with energies of order @xmath46 , according to observations near 1  au in the solar wind @xcite and to particle - in - cell models @xcite .",
    "flaring regions in the solar corona have densities of @xmath47 to @xmath48  @xmath49 @xcite and fields around 50  g , yielding protons with energies in the tens of kev range .",
    "how these seed particles reach much higher energies remains unclear .",
    "ideas include repeated shock crossings ( as reviewed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "the sun produced more energetic particles when young : the x - ray flares observed in young stars , scaled by the solar relationship between x - ray luminosity and proton emission , indicate a @xmath50-fold enhancement in energetic protons compared to contemporary solar levels @xcite .",
    "such an enhancement appears to be consistent with a spallation origin for @xmath16al and other short - lived radionuclides whose decay products occur in primitive chondritic meteorites @xcite . in addition , the magnetic fields of young solar - mass stars are strong enough for reconnection to produce large numbers of seed particles with energies above an mev .",
    "t  tauri stars have kilogauss surface - averaged magnetic fields , three orders of magnitude stronger than the modern sun @xcite , while the densities of gas on coronal magnetic loops , inferred from the emitted x - rays , are around @xmath48 @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "absorption of the x - rays by foreground coronal material indicates columns also consistent with such densities @xcite .",
    "the characteristic energy of the seed protons produced in reconnection under these conditions is 10  mev if the fields are uniformly - distributed , or larger if as is likely the fields are patchy across the face of the star .",
    "lacking better knowledge of the arrangement of the magnetic fields near the star , we can not say whether the stellar coronal protons are channeled back into the star , out along open field lines into a wind , or toward the disk which may reach or penetrate the boundary of the stellar magnetosphere .",
    "since our objective is a minimum size for the dead zone , we shall assume that the protons propagate in straight lines like the x - rays , reaching all parts of the disk surface unimpeded .",
    "one must also bear in mind that most of the protons are produced in flares lasting only hours or days .",
    "the flare particles will reduce the size of the dead zone in the disk if the ionization created in one flare persists till the next .",
    "calculations of the ionization due to x - ray flares suggest that the recombination time is less than the interval between flares unless the abundance of the dust in the disk is greatly reduced @xcite .",
    "a more conservative estimate of the contribution of the stellar energetic particles comes from scaling the modern sun up to the x - ray luminosity corresponding to @xmath51 .",
    "the effective enhancement in the energetic protons is then only about 3.3  decades and the rate of ionization is comparable to that resulting from the stellar x - rays .",
    "nevertheless , in the interest of obtaining a minimum dead zone size , we treat the @xmath50-fold enhancement in the energetic protons as time - steady .",
    "the flux falls off roughly as the inverse square of the distance , at distances much greater than the size of the stellar magnetosphere .",
    "projection effects reduce the flux per unit disk area by about a factor ten , since the disk surface is inclined about 0.1  radian from the line of sight to the star .",
    "we take a surface ionisation rate @xmath52 of @xmath53 times the interstellar cosmic ray value .",
    "the particles from the coronae of the disk and star are assumed to decline with column in the same way as the interstellar cosmic rays , following eq .",
    "[ eqn : zetacr ] .",
    "the relative strengths of the different ionization processes are shown in figure  [ fig : compared ] where the ionization rates at a column of 8  g  @xmath0 are plotted versus radius .",
    "compared with the stellar x - rays , the stellar energetic protons are 40  times stronger and are the strongest process plotted .",
    "the disk coronal energetic protons are a few times weaker than the x - rays at 0.1  au and fall off faster with distance .",
    "the interstellar cosmic rays are distance - independent and are stronger than the x - rays outside 16  au . if enhanced a thousand times due to a nearby supernova , interstellar cosmic rays are stronger than the stellar x - rays outside 0.5  au and are the strongest of all the processes outside 3  au .",
    "recombination in the gas phase and on grain surfaces balances the ionization processes in local chemical equilibrium .",
    "we find the balance by solving the reduced chemical reaction network discussed by @xcite .",
    "the ionization produces molecular ions which are destroyed through dissociative recombination , or by charge exchange with metal atoms which then recombine radiatively .",
    "magnesium is chosen as a representative gas - phase metal because of its combination of high abundance and low desorption temperature .",
    "the amount initially in the gas is chosen to be 1% of the solar magnesium abundance .",

    "<S> we calculate the location of the magnetically - inactive dead zone in the minimum - mass protosolar disk , under ionization scenarios including stellar x - rays , long- or short - lived radionuclide decay , and energetic protons arriving from the general interstellar medium , from a nearby supernova explosion , from the disk corona , or from the corona of the young star . </S>",
    "<S> the disk contains a dead zone in all scenarios except those with small dust grains removed and a fraction of the short - lived radionuclides remaining in the gas . </S>",
    "<S> all the cases without exception have an `` undead zone '' where intermediate resistivities prevent magneto - rotational turbulence while allowing shear - generated large - scale magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the mass column in the undead zone is typically greater than the column in the turbulent surface layers . </S>",
    "<S> the results support the idea that the dead and undead zones are robust consequences of cold , dusty gas with mass columns exceeding 1000  g  @xmath0 . </S>"
