    "ultracompact ( uc ) h ii regions , which are known to be bright compact galactic radio sources , are thought to be powered by massive young stars still embedded in their parent molecular clouds ( wood & churchwell 1989 ; hereafter wc ) .",
    "they are very small ( r @xmath10 0.1 pc ) and dense ( high electron number density : @xmath11 10@xmath12 @xmath13 ) , and have a large emission measure ( em @xmath14 10@xmath15 pc @xmath16 ) . the spectral type of the ionizing star is uncertain for most of the uc h ii regions because the ionizing stars are heavily extinguished by the dust clouds surrounding the uc h ii regions , which prevent optical and even near - infrared observations even though the ionizing stars are very luminous . on the other hand , mid - infrared fine - structure lines do not suffer so heavily from extinction by the dust , and thus are good probes of the uc h ii regions .",
    "since the warm dust which surround the uc h ii regions re - radiates nearly all of the absorbed stellar photons in the far - infrared , the uc h ii regions are known as strong _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) point sources , with flux densities @xmath17 10@xmath12 jy at 100 @xmath0 .",
    "wc pointed out that the total fir luminosity derived from the _ iras _ flux is larger than that expected from the spectral type of the ionizing star estimated from the radio continuum flux for most of the uc h ii regions they observed .",
    "two possible interpretations were presented by wc ; 1 ) strong dust absorption of ionizing photons inside the uc h ii region , and 2 ) presence of a stellar cluster including a large number of non - ionizing low - mass stars , which substantially contribute to the total luminosity . however , due to the uncertainty in the dust extinction inside the uc h ii region , it is difficult to distinguish which effect is dominant .    in this paper",
    ", we propose the [ ne ii ] line at 12.814 @xmath0 as a probe of the spectral type of the ionizing star .",
    "the ionization potential of neon ( ne@xmath18 ne@xmath3 : 21.56 ev ) is higher than that of hydrogen , and therefore , this line is a good tracer of early - type ( especially b0 or late - o ) stars which form the uc h ii regions .",
    "moreover , the [ ne ii ] flux is not sensitive to @xmath19 as long as @xmath20 (= 3.6 @xmath21 10@xmath22 @xmath13 ; the critical density of the line ; lacy , beck , & geballe 1982 ) , and are thus good probes of the ionic abundance , even for dense uc h ii regions .",
    "in addition , since the line is within the atmospheric window , the _ n_@xmath1band ( 8@xmath113 @xmath0 ) , it is accessible from ground - based telescopes .    the sizes of uc h ii regions are very small ; the typical source size of @xmath23 0.1 pc corresponds to 2@xmath2 on the sky if the source is located at 10 kpc away from us .",
    "thus the [ ne ii ] line observations in the previous work could not spatially resolve the source due to their large beams ( 7@xmath130@xmath2 ) .",
    "the 2@xmath2 spatial resolution of the present work enables us to obtain the spatially resolved [ ne ii ] images of the uc h ii regions , which can be directly compared with the radio vla images ( wc ; kurtz , churchwell & wood 1994 ) .    in the recent work by watarai et al .",
    "( 1998 ; hereafter wmtm ) , we presented [ ne ii ] observational results for two uc h ii regions , g29.96@xmath10.02 and w51d , using the same instrumentation , and estimated the effective temperature of the ionizing star from the ne@xmath3 abundance , by using h ii region models based on recent stellar atmosphere models . here ,",
    "we present new observational results for four uc h ii regions including w51d , for which observations were performed over a wider area than that of wmtm . because of the increased number of observed sources in this work",
    ", we can discuss the relation between the spectral type of the ionizing star and the ne@xmath3 distribution of the uc h ii regions .",
    "the selected four uc h ii regions are w51d , g45.12 + 0.13 , g35.20@xmath11.74 , and mon r2 from the wc source list .",
    "w51d , also known as w51 irs 2 , is the brightest region in the w51 star forming region .",
    "the total fir luminosity is estimated to be 3 @xmath21 10@xmath24 l@xmath25 ( erickson & tokunaga 1980 ) , which is a factor of 3 brighter than the bolometric luminosity of an o4 zero - age main sequence ( zams ) star , whereas the lyman continuum luminosity ( @xmath26 ) derived from the radio flux corresponds to that of an o5.5 star .",
    "g45.12 + 0.13 is a well - studied uc h ii region at many wavelengths .",
    "lumsden & puxley ( 1996 ) showed very good positional coincidence between the br@xmath27 peak and the radio continuum peak .",
    "wc noted that an o4 ( single ) star or o5 ( cluster ) star is required to explain the fir luminosity ( 1.7 @xmath21 10@xmath24 l@xmath28 ) , whereas a single o5 star can account for the lyman continuum luminosity ( log @xmath29 49.53 ) .",
    "g35.20@xmath11.74 is part of the w48 complex . according to wc ,",
    "the total fir luminosity ( 2.8 @xmath21 10@xmath22 l@xmath28 ) measured by _ iras _ is larger than that expected from the spectral type ( o7.5 ) derived from the radio observation . as for mon r2 ,",
    "its fir luminosity is dominated by irs 1 .",
    "downes et al .",
    "( 1975 ) estimated the spectral type of the ionizing star to be b0 zams or earlier star based on the radio observation .",
    "howard , pipher , & forrest ( 1994 ) also reported that the ionizing star located at irs 1@xmath30 ( see figure 1 or table 4 in their paper ) is b0@xmath1b3 .",
    "the galactocentric distances ( r@xmath31 ) of these sources are similar to that of the sun ( @xmath32 = 6@xmath19 kpc ) , and hence we assume a constant elemental abundance of neon equal to the local interstellar abundance ( hereafter lia ) : 9.9 @xmath21 10@xmath33 ( simpson et al . 1998 ) .    this paper is organized as follows . in @xmath342 , we describe the observations , and the data reduction . in @xmath343",
    ", we present the [ ne ii ] images , and derive the ne@xmath3 abundance map . in @xmath344 , we discuss the effective temperature for each source by using calculations based on the latest stellar atmosphere models in relation to the ionization structure . we also give some remarks for individual sources .",
    "finally , @xmath345 gives the summary of this work .",
    "the [ ne ii ] 12.8 @xmath0 line images were obtained at the wyoming infrared observatory ( wiro ) using a liquid helium cooled mid - infrared fabry - perot imager ( mirfi ; watarai et al .",
    "1996 ) developed at nagoya university .",
    "mirfi incorporates a si : p 5 @xmath21 5 detector array sensitive to mid - infrared wavelength ( @xmath9 28 @xmath0 ) , and a fabry - perot interferometer with spectral resolving power @xmath35 ( 190 km s@xmath36 in velocity ) .",
    "the plate scale with the wiro 2.3-m telescope is 1@xmath37 pixel@xmath36 and so the field - of - view ( fov ) is 10@xmath382 @xmath21 10@xmath382 including gaps between pixels .",
    "the observations of the uc h ii regions were carried out on 4@xmath111 october 1997 .",
    "the telescope beam was mainly pointed at the radio peaks . however , since the fov of mirfi is not large enough to cover the whole h ii region , we carried out a raster mapping . for each source ,",
    "the raster mapping was carried out at various spatial positions around the radio continuum peaks .",
    "one frame of data was taken at each raster position .",
    "each raster position was accurately determined by position analysis using observations of the guide stars .",
    "the spatial sampling interval of the raster frames is 0@xmath398 .",
    "after the flat - fielding using the blank sky data , the final images were made up by mosaicing of the images taken at all raster positions .",
    "finally we could obtain wider spatial coverage images of each source .",
    "details of observations are shown in table 1 and 2 .",
    "the secondary chopping frequency is 2.5 hz , and the chopper throw was 40@xmath2 along the east - west direction .",
    "furthermore , nearly all data were taken by nodding of the telescope beam by 40@xmath2 along the east - west direction in order to remove the residual sky emission features which were visible in the data with a single chopping beam .",
    "the [ ne ii ] spectral data were acquired by wavelength scanning of fabry - perot interferometer in ",
    "line scan \" mode ( watarai et al . 1996 ) . in this mode ,",
    "the interferometer scans around the [ ne ii ] line wavelength in 16 steps over the wavelength range of 0.034 @xmath0 ( 770 km s@xmath36 in velocity ) with a step size of 0.0021 @xmath0 ( 48 km s@xmath36 ) .",
    "it takes 12.8 sec to perform a line scan .",
    "we define 40 line scans , half of which are taken at each nodding position , as 1 _ frame _ , hence the total observing time of 1 frame is 512 sec .",
    "the 3@xmath40 detection limit was estimated to be 6 @xmath21 10@xmath41 w @xmath42 pixel@xmath36 for 1 frame observing time .",
    "the absolute flux scale was calibrated using the continuum fluxes emitted from the mid - infrared bright stars @xmath43 ori , @xmath44 cyg , and @xmath43 tau .",
    "the flux densities at 12 @xmath0 of these stars are assumed to be 2820 jy , 850 jy and 450 jy , respectively .",
    "the flux of @xmath43 ori is taken from the _ iras _ low resolution spectrometer ( lrs ) data ( olnon et al .",
    "1986 ) , the flux of @xmath44 cyg is taken from gillett , low , & stein ( 1968 ) , and the flux of @xmath43 tau is given in the mid - infrared spectra measured by cohen & davies ( 1995 ) .",
    "the uncertainty of the absolute flux calibration is estimated to be @xmath45 12 % including the uncertainty in the line - fitting procedure .",
    "the observed spectra at the [ ne ii ] peak positions are shown in figure 1 . each spectrum has been fitted with a constant continuum and a lorentzian line profile .",
    "the spectral resolution of mirfi is larger than the intrinsic [ ne ii ] line width expected for uc h ii regions ( @xmath9 100 km s@xmath36 ) , and so the derived line profiles represent instrumental ones .",
    "the central wavelength and the wavelength scale were determined by the measurement of two nearby bright atmospheric emission features ( 12.832 @xmath0 and 12.870 @xmath0 ) . as a result , the fwhm line width and",
    "the central wavelength were determined to an accuracy of @xmath46 @xmath9 20 km s@xmath36 ( 3@xmath40 ) .",
    "mirfi is equipped with an _",
    "h_@xmath1band monitor for guiding the source into the mir detector fov and for checking the pointing accuracy . during each observation ,",
    "bright sao stars near the sources were pointed before and after every [ ne ii ] line observation of the sources .",
    "the resulting uncertainty in the position determination was estimated to be @xmath9 1@xmath2 .",
    "for the positional data of the guide stars , we used the latest _",
    "hst _ guide star catalog.form.html ]",
    "as we described before , the raster mapping was carried out for each source .",
    "the line fluxes at same sky positions between the frames taken at different raster positions agree well within the statistical errors .",
    "therefore , the relative flux calibration among all raster positions is reliable .",
    "the number of raster positions (= number of the frames ) obtained for each source are listed in table 2 .",
    "mon r2 was observed over a lot of frames , but only one - third of the radio emitting region was covered , since mon r2 extends to more than 25@xmath2 wide .",
    "furthermore , we took frames at only 5 raster positions for g35.20@xmath11.74 , hence the whole emitting region could not be covered .",
    "the final [ ne ii ] images smoothed by a @xmath47 fwhm ( 1 pixel of mirfi detector array ) gaussian profile and corrected for the interstellar extinction are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the [ ne ii ] peak positions of all sources except for g45.12 + 0.13 show good agreement with the 5 or 15 ghz radio continuum peaks within the positional error . as for the correction for interstellar extinction",
    ", the following values are used ; @xmath48 = 20 mag for w51d based on @xmath49 , and radio observations by goldader & wynn - williams ( 1994 ) , @xmath50 24 mag for g45.12 + 0.13 from the br@xmath27 imaging and the radio continuum observations by lumsden & puxley ( 1996 ) , @xmath50 23 mag for g35.20@xmath11.74 derived from co observations ( valle & macleod 1990 ) and from the br@xmath43/br@xmath27 ratio ( woodward , helfer , & pipher 1985 ) , and @xmath50 23 mag for mon r2 , from the br@xmath27/br@xmath43 ratio with a relatively large beam ( 28@xmath2 ) by natta et al .",
    "we assume a uniform extinction over the whole area of each source .",
    "however , the [ ne ii ] line is on the 10 @xmath0 silicate feature and the extinction law from nir to mir wavelength is still uncertain , especially toward uc h ii regions . moreover",
    "it may vary with location in the galaxy .",
    "@xmath48 also may have spatial distribution inside the sources .",
    "hence the uncertainty due to extinction should be an additional @xmath51 20 % .      in order to obtain the ne@xmath3 abundance ( [ ne@xmath3/h@xmath3 ] )",
    ", we derive the physical properties using the observed [ ne ii ] flux and the 5 or 15 ghz radio continuum flux .",
    "the procedure is described in wmtm in more detail .",
    "first , we calculated the brightness temperature ( @xmath52 ) and the optical depth ( @xmath53 ) of each source from their radio continuum fluxes , and then the emission measure ( em ) was derived using an expression of the free - free radiation including a correction for the optical depth effect .",
    "we estimated a dependence of the electron temperature to em assuming case - b recombination .",
    "the em changes only a few percent under the physical condition of typical uc h ii regions , even if @xmath54 changes from 5000 k to 15000 k. accordingly we have considered the error of em is mainly caused by systematic and absolute flux errors . since the radio fluxes are quoted from the same wc survey data , the relative errors in the radio fluxes among the sources should be very small .",
    "the values of vla image rms in a 1@xmath557 resolution element are only 1@xmath14 % . on the other hand , the absolute radio flux errors over the whole h ii regions can be estimated from the differences between vla observations and single dish observations , which are about 20 % for all sources ( e.g. , massi et al .",
    "finally we have added this uncertainty for that of em for  total region \" .",
    "the [ ne ii ] emission line photons are emitted as a result of collisional excitation by electrons .",
    "for all sources observed , the critical density ( @xmath56 = 3.6 @xmath21 10@xmath22 @xmath13 for the [ ne ii ] line ) is much larger than the electron number density ( @xmath57 10@xmath22 @xmath13 ) estimated from the em derived from the radio flux for the angular scale of the mirfi beam .",
    "therefore we neglect the correction for the critical density ( @xmath58 1 ) and the line flux is assumed to be proportional to em .",
    "then the ionic abundance of singly ionized neon is expressed as : @xmath59}\\ ( w\\ cm^{-2})}}{2.3\\times10^{-9}\\ \\omega_{b}\\ t_{e}^{-1/2}\\ e^{-hc/\\lambda k t_{e}}\\ { \\rm em}}.\\ ] ] here @xmath60}$ ] is the intrinsic [ ne ii ] line flux corrected for interstellar extinction , @xmath61 is the solid angle of the observed area , and @xmath54 is the electron temperature of the source .    the observed and extinction - corrected [ ne ii ] flux , and derived physical properties are listed in table 3 .",
    "the  total region \" means the whole region in which the [ ne ii ] emission is appreciably ( 3@xmath40 ) detected .",
    "the  peak region \" represents the 1@xmath387 @xmath21 1@xmath387 region ( corresponding to 1 pixel of mirfi ) centered at each radio continuum peak .",
    "additionally we assumed electron temperature for optically thin h ii regions , however , the extreme peaks of w51d and g45.12 + 0.13 are thought to be not optically thin .",
    "wc estimated peak brightness temperatures of 9800 k and 8100 k with corresponding optical depths of 3.71 and 1.66 for w51d and g45.12 + 0.13 , respectively ( see their table 17 ) .",
    "they assumed t@xmath62 = 10,000 k. our assumptions of electron temperature for these two sources are 7700 k and 8000 k. these may not be suitable for the peaks due to the optical depth effect , because an electron temperature distribution does make a difference from flat distribution around radio peak as we assumed .",
    "when the integrated radio fluxes before smoothing over the 1.7 arcsec@xmath63 beam at peaks compare with that of after smoothing , the differences are 2@xmath112 % for each source .",
    "these are the additional uncertainty in their radio flux , succeedingly t@xmath64 , @xmath53 and em for  peak region \" . on the other hand ,",
    "averages for  total region \" may not be significantly affected by the high optical depth at extreme radio peaks .",
    "we also derived the ne@xmath3 abundance maps , using the [ ne ii ] images and the radio continuum images smoothed by the beam of mirfi .",
    "these are shown in figure 3 . in order to aid the eye to see the trend of the ne@xmath3 abundance distribution , in figure 4 we also show the cut views through the radio peak .",
    "the directions of the cut are shown in figure 3 ( a@xmath1a@xmath65 ) . as is seen in figure 3 , the ne@xmath3 abundance has its minimum at the radio peak for all sources , and increases steeply towards the outer regions , especially for w51d and g45.12 + 0.13 ( the ratio of the ne@xmath3 abundance at the radio peak ( 1@xmath387 @xmath21 1@xmath387 ) to that of the total area ( [ ne@xmath3/h@xmath66_{\\rm peak}$]/[ne@xmath3/h@xmath66_{\\rm total}$ ] ) are 0.35 @xmath45 0.07 for w51d and 0.28 @xmath45 0.04 for g45.12 + 0.13 ) , which are ionized by relatively massive stars . on the other hand , the ne@xmath3 distributions are relatively uniform for g35.20@xmath11.74 and mon r2 ( [ ne@xmath3/h@xmath66_{\\rm peak}$]/[ne@xmath3/h@xmath66_{\\rm total}$ ] are 0.87 @xmath45 0.17 for g35.20@xmath11.74 and 0.72 @xmath45 0.12 for mon r2 ) , which are ionized by relatively low - mass stars .",

    "the volume ratio of the ne@xmath82 sphere to the ne@xmath3 shell is determined so that the average [ ne@xmath82/ne@xmath3 ] over the whole h ii region is equal to that expected from the following effective temperature based on the model calculation shown in figure 5 : 39,000 k for figure 6@xmath68 , 37,000 k for 6@xmath70 , 35,000 k for 6@xmath83 , and 33,000 k for 6@xmath71 , respectively .",
    "the average ne@xmath3 abundance distribution over the lines of sight crossing the equator of the sphere is also given in bottom of each panel of figure 6 .",
    "the observed ne@xmath3 distributions as cut - views shown in figure 4 are well explained by the model ; figure 6@xmath68 corresponds well with the cut view of w51d , in the same way , 6@xmath70 to g45.12 + 0.13 , 6@xmath83 to g35.20@xmath11.74 , and 6@xmath71 to mon r2 .",
    "however , clearly an actual h ii region is not spherically symmetric , and thus the two - dimensional ne@xmath3 distribution shown in figure 3 can not quantitatively be modeled since the detailed structure of the actual h ii region is unknown .",
    "we would emphasize , however , the general trend seen in the variety of the ne@xmath3 abundance distributions is consistent with this simple model .",
    "an alternative explanation for the cause of the relatively low ne@xmath3 abundance obtained for w51d and g45.12 + 0.13 may be that the [ ne ii ] emission is heavily extinguished by dust even though the line is in mir wavelength .",
    "especially there may be the localized variation in the extinction by dust .",
    "however , if the intrinsic [ ne ii ] fluxes from these sources are an order of magnitude higher that those presented in table 3 , then the extinction should be enormous : @xmath50 65 mag . furthermore , clear near - infrared images of br@xmath27 line emission which are similar to vla images have been reported for both sources ( w51d : goldader & wynn - williams 1994 ; g45.12 + 0.13 : lumsden & puxley 1996 ) .",
    "hence it is not likely that such large amount of dust exists as a foreground screen .    in table 4 , we compare the estimated spectral types with those derived from the fir and the radio luminosity .",
    "interestingly , for the luminous sources w51d and g45.12 + 0.13 , the spectral types derived from the fir and the radio luminosity are much earlier than that estimated by the present work , while for the less luminous sources g35.20@xmath11.74 and mon r2 , both estimates are in good agreement .",
    "one possible explanation for this trend is that the ionizing source is not a single star but is a star cluster , especially for the luminous sources .",
    "the spectral type derived from the fir luminosity may be earlier than the actual spectral type because in the relatively large fir ( _ iras _ ) beam , numerous low - mass stars can contribute to the heating of the dust and hence increase the fir luminosity , though they do not contribute to either the hydrogen or neon ionizing photons .",
    "the single - star spectral type derived from the radio luminosity ( wc ) may also be earlier than that of the actual one if the h ii region is ionized by early type stars which do not emit neon ionizing photons .    moreover",
    ", the ne@xmath3 abundance would not be a good tracer of the spectral type of the principal ionizing stars of the h ii regions formed by very luminous stars like w51d and g45.12 + 0.13 , since ne@xmath3 is not the dominant species of neon for such sources . the observed [ ne ii ] image is likely to be contaminated by the contribution from less luminous ionizing stars , leading us to underestimate the spectral type of the principal ionizing star .",
    "we will further discuss this matter in @xmath344.2.2 , especially for g45.12 + 0.13 . in case of less luminous sources , the h ii regions are likely",
    "to be ionized by a single star , and ne@xmath3 is the dominant species of neon .",
    "therefore , the radio - derived spectral type agrees well with that derived in the present work .",
    "the [ ne@xmath82/ne@xmath3 ] abundance ratio would be a better tracer of the spectral type of the ionizing stars , since this does not depend on the total elemental abundance of neon .",
    "however , as shown in table 4 , the spectral type derived by the mir line ratio ( [ ne ii ] 12.8 @xmath0 and [ ne iii ] 15.6 @xmath0 ; simpson & rubin 1990 ) is much later than that derived by the radio luminosity .",
    "since these mir lines are observed with the large beam of _ iras _ lrs ( 25@xmath130@xmath2 ) , there might exist some contamination by less luminous ionizing stars .",
    "observations of the mir [ ne iii ] lines ( 15.6 @xmath0 and 36.0 @xmath0 ) at higher angular resolution can provide an answer to this problem .",
    "_ a ) w51d _ the derived effective temperature ( @xmath23 38,500 k ) is similar to that concluded by wmtm . figure 3@xmath68 and figure 4@xmath68 indicate that the ne@xmath82 is the dominant species of neon in w51d .",
    "_ b ) g45.12 + 0.13 _ the [ ne ii ] peak is not associated with the main radio peak ( position a ) , but is associated with the second radio peak ( position b ; see figure 2 ) .",
    "since the positional uncertainty of our observation is @xmath9 1@xmath2 , a spatial separation between two peaks of @xmath23 2@xmath2 is significant .",
    "the ne@xmath3 abundance derived at the [ ne ii ] peak ( position b ) is twice as large as that of the radio peak ( position a ) .",
    "one possible explanation for this excess of the ne@xmath3 abundance at position b is that there is a small h ii region ionized by a relatively late type star at position b superposed on the major h ii region ionized by a massive star located at position a. crude estimates of the [ ne ii ] and radio fluxes originating from this small h ii region are 2.1 @xmath21 10@xmath69 w @xmath42 and 0.87 jy , respectively , giving the ne@xmath3 abundance in the small h ii region as 8.6 @xmath21 10@xmath33 , which indicates the existence of a b0 star ( @xmath84 33,000 k : figure 5 ) .",
    "however there is no firm evidence for the existence of the small h ii region , and it is noteworthy that the center velocities of the [ ne ii ] lines at both positions are the same within the error of the wavelength calibration ( @xmath9 20 km s@xmath36 ) .",
    "hence the small h ii region , if it exists , should have almost the same proper motion as that of the major h ii region .",
    "alternatively , the excess of the ne@xmath3 abundance could be simply due to a geometrical effect .",
    "since the effective temperature of the major ionizing star is relatively high , most of ne@xmath3 ions are ionized to a higher ionization state ( ne@xmath82 ) .",
    "then we may expect that the ne@xmath3 region is distributed around the ne@xmath82 region like a thin shell , and position b may be simply the tangential component of the ne@xmath3 shell , enhancing the ne@xmath3 abundance .",
    "there are many measurements of ne and other lines that can be used to model the h ii regions and thereby determined the stellar types .",
    "colgan et al .",
    "( 1991 ) reported the results of observations of fir lines . the derived effective temperature ( @xmath23 37,000 k ) is nearly consistent with our result",
    ". however ratio of ne@xmath3/ne@xmath82 is inconsistent with our results .",
    "the difference is caused by as follows : colgan et al .",
    "used lte models ( kurucz 1979 ) to estimate the effective temperature ( see watarai et al .",
    "we re - estimated its using non - lte ( @xmath79 ) models and the ne@xmath3/ne@xmath82 ratio they used , which became to be @xmath23 34,000 k. furthermore the beam size of their observations are larger than the size of sources , hence there may be some possibility of contaminations .    in order to reveal the true picture , observations of both the [ ne ii ] line and [ ne iii ] line images at higher spatial resolution",
    "are essentially needed .",
    "the results will soon confirm by large aperture telescope observations like sofia ( @xmath85 ) and subaru .    _",
    "c ) g35.20@xmath11.74 _ from figure 3@xmath83 and figure 4@xmath83 , the ne@xmath3 abundance is distributed uniformly like mon r2 but is lower than the lia of neon .",
    "one possible interpretation is that because the observed region does not cover the whole h ii region , we may have selectively observed the ionized region in which ne@xmath82 is the dominant species of neon . as shown in figure 4@xmath83 , the ne@xmath3 abundance tends to increase gradually at the outer part .",
    "furthermore , the ne@xmath3 abundance at the peak region is larger than those of w51d or g45.12 + 0.13 ( table 3 ) , suggesting that the thickness of ne@xmath3 region toward the peak is relatively large , as shown in figure 6@xmath83 .",
    "hence the ne@xmath3 abundance presented for the total region would be a lower limit of the ne@xmath3 abundance over the whole source and the corresponding stellar effective temperature ( 37,000 k ) would be an upper limit . the cut view shown in figure 4@xmath83 corresponds well with the average ne@xmath3 distribution presented in figure 6@xmath83 .",
    "these results indicate that there exists a slightly lower temperature star ( @xmath23 35,000 k ) in g35.20@xmath11.74 , than those of w51d and g45.12 + 0.13 , but higher than the one in mon r2 .",
    "persi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) proposed that these are b0@xmath1b3 stars .",
    "wc also reported that the spectral type of the ionizing star is o9@xmath1o9.5 based on the fir flux and radio fluxes .",
    "further observations with much wider spatial coverage than the present work are necessary to confirm this .",
    "_ d ) mon r2 _",
    "the ne@xmath3 abundance map represents uniform distribution .",
    "the value of the ne@xmath3 abundance is larger than those of the other sources and is as large as the lia of neon .",
    "this implies that the spectral type of ionizing star is not earlier than o9 .",
    "howard , pipher , & forrest ( 1994 ) showed that irs 1@xmath30 is a b0@xmath1b3 star , consistent with our results .",
    "furthermore , although with a larger beam ( 7@xmath130@xmath2 ) , herter et al . ( 1982 ) reported that the low excitation lines ( [ ar ii ] 6.99 @xmath0 , [ s iii ] 18.7 @xmath0 and [ ne ii ] 12.8 @xmath0 ) were detected significantly , while high excitation one ( [ ar iii ] 8.99 @xmath0 and [ s iv ] 10.5 @xmath0 ) were not clearly detected , supporting that the spectral type is early b.    we use @xmath48 = 23 mag as the correction for interstellar extinction ( natta et al .",
    "natta et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and massi , felli , & simon ( 1985 ) pointed out that different values of the extinction were derived from measurements with different beam sizes , implying that the extinction is not uniform .",
    "howard , pipher , & forrest ( 1994 ) presented the extinction map from br@xmath43 and br@xmath27 images , reporting an extinction @xmath23 27.3 mag at the irs 1@xmath30 .",
    "the ne@xmath3 abundance map presented here shows a slight increase toward the outside from the peak . hence if the value @xmath23 30 mag is used for the correction due to extinction at the peak , the ne@xmath3 abundance map would become more uniform",
    "mid - infrared [ ne ii ] line images of four galactic uc h ii regions with @xmath23 2@xmath2 spatial resolution are presented .",
    "the main results and conclusions are as follows .    1 .",
    "the [ ne ii ] images are spatially resolved for all sources . in comparison with the radio vla images ,",
    "the [ ne ii ] line and radio continuum images are found to be generally in good agreement .",
    "we also derived the ne@xmath3 abundance maps .",
    "for w51d and g45.12 + 0.13 , the ne@xmath3 abundance steeply decreases toward the radio peak and is lowest at the radio peak .",
    "this suggests the ne@xmath82 region dominates near the centers of these h ii regions . on the other hand ,",
    "the ne@xmath3 abundance is distributed rather uniformly for g35.20@xmath11.74 and mon r2 , and the ne@xmath3 abundance is almost equal to the lia of neon for mon r2 .",
    "these trends indicate that the spectral type of the ionizing star plays a major role in the ne@xmath3 abundance distribution .",
    "we estimated the effective temperature of the ionizing stars from the ne@xmath3 abundance by using h ii region models based on the latest stellar atmospheric models : 39,100 @xmath6 k for w51d , 37,200 @xmath7 k for g45.12 + 0.13 , 37,600 @xmath8 k for g35.20@xmath11.74 , and @xmath9 34,000 k for mon r2 .",
    "the range of the effective temperatures include the effect of galactic gradient in ne / h .",
    "we further proposed a simple model of the ionization structure of neon controlled solely by the stellar effective temperature .",
    "the averaged ne@xmath3 distribution derived from the present observations ( figure 4 ) and that from the models ( lower graphs of each model in figure 6 ) generally agree well . as a result , the effective temperature of the ionizing star for g35.20@xmath11.74 is estimated to be @xmath23 35,000 k. 3 .",
    "we also presented several results and discussions for individual sources as follows ; possible interpretations of the difference between [ ne ii ] and radio continuum peaks in g45.12 + 0.13 , and the non - uniform effect of interstellar extinction for mon r2 .",
