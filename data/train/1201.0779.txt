    "important characteristic of three dimensional ( 3d ) and low dimensional conductors and semiconductors is a dispersion of collective excitations , particularly the plasma waves or plasmons .",
    "knowledge of the plasmon dispersion allows us to analyze various processes in geterostructures .",

    "we use this model for definition of dispersion of the quantum collective excitations in graphene at the presence of the external magnetic field .",
    "the background of this research is the model presented in ref .",
    "this model describes the dynamic of electrons in graphene and reflects essential characteristics of the conduction electrons in graphene .",
    "the basic equation describing microscopic dynamics of the conduction electrons in graphene is the many - particle equation which can be presented in the form analogous to the schrodinger equation ( or the dirac equation )  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the hamilton operator . in the absence of external fields and interaction between particles",
    "the hamiltonian has form @xmath2 , here @xmath3 is the number of particles in the system , @xmath4 is the fermi velocity of electrons in graphene , @xmath5 is the momentum operator , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the derivative on coordinate of @xmath8-th particle , @xmath9 are the pauli matrixes . described model corresponds to the massless behavior of the conductivity electrons in graphene  @xcite .",
    "the coulomb interaction between the electrons in graphene is considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . equation ( [ graph schr eq general form ] ) as the many - particle schrodinger equation is not always suitable for description of the collective properties in many - particle systems .",
    "this problem connects with the fact that equation ( [ graph schr eq general form ] ) determines the wave function in the 3n ( 2n , for two dimensional system ) dimensional configuration space , whereas the collective process realize in the 3d ( 2d ) physical space .",
    "therefore , it is important to construct a method in the 3d ( 2d ) physical space  @xcite .",
    "the method of quantum hydrodynamics ( qhd ) solves the problem of transition from configuration space to physical space .",
    "this method was suggested for many - particle system and has been developed for a wide class of physical systems .",
    "method of the many - particle qhd ( mpqhd ) allows us derive equations for quantum observable values evolution in the 3d ( 2d ) physical space .",
    "equations of continuity , momentum balance , energy balance , momentum evolution ( for particles with spin ) and polarization ( for polarized particles ) are appeared from the schrodinger equation .",
    "most of them are analogous to classic hydrodynamic equations . in connection with described above the method is called `` quantum hydrodynamics '' . method of the qhd is a modern powerful method for studying of the collective properties in systems of charged  @xcite-  @xcite , and neutral  @xcite ,  @xcite particles ( see also review  @xcite ) .",
    "unusual properties of electrons of conductivity in graphene mapped in the equation ( [ graph schr eq general form ] ) and mapped in the form of the qhd equations for graphene ( gqhd ) , which we present below .",
    "the equations of the gqhd in this paper has the extreme difference from the qhd equations obtained previously  @xcite -  @xcite . in context of using of the dirac equation for description of graphene electrons",
    "we note that in ref .",
    "@xcite the qhd equation were derived from the bispinor dirac equation for massive particles .",
    "obtained there equations were averaged on ensemble for receiving of equations for many - particle system .",
    "comparison of the qhd equations for graphene with the usual qhd equations  @xcite ,  @xcite we present below during the derivation of the gqhd equations for graphene . as expected unusual properties of electrons of conductivity in graphene lead to exotic spectrum of elementary excitations . in 2d electron gas ( 2deg )",
    "the basic type of the collective excitations is the langmuir waves , the dispersion dependence of these waves are @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the charge and mass of electrons ( @xmath11 we consider as algebraic quantity , @xmath13 , for electrons ) , @xmath14 is the 2d concentration of electrons , @xmath15 is the absolute value of the wave vector . for the graphene electrons in the absence of external fields",
    "the dispersion equation is @xmath16 so , we did not obtain the contribution of interaction in dispersion , and , consequently , from our description the graphene langmuir frequency ( see ref .",
    "@xcite p.414 ) does not follow .",
    "the recent studies of excitations in graphene being in a magnetic field have employed the picture of single electron excitation and it s transition between energy levels , such as the landau levels , which exist for single charged particle in an external field .",
    "consideration of microscopic picture of excitations show that some of these excitations lead to the formation of collective excitations  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "if we want to study macroscopic collective excitations in the graphene , we do not need to consider one electron excitation . for described purpose we can use hydrodynamics or kinetics methods as it has been used for two dimensional electron gas , usual three dimensional carriers and semiconductors .",
    "these method get used to be used for getting of characteristics of the collective excitations in described objects , such as the langmuir waves , the magneto - sound waves , the bernstein modes , and etc .",
    "so , we can see that obtaining of the hydrodynamics description of graphene is the important task .",
    "the method of the many - particle qhd gives us possibility to derive gqhd equations , which make more rich a set of theoretical tools of graphene excitations studying .",

    "were used in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see .",
    "it was made for account of external magnetic field in equation ( [ graph hamiltonian ] ) the spinor wave function @xmath29 depend on 2n coordinates @xmath30 $ ] and time , where @xmath31 $ ] is the 2d coordinates of each particle .",
    "potentials @xmath32 , @xmath33 also depend on 2d variables .",
    "this fact has deep consequences .",
    "potential part of electric field connected with the scalar potential via space derivative : @xmath34 .",
    "consequently in equation ( [ graph hamiltonian ] ) there is no contribution of external electric field directed perpendicular to the graphene plane @xmath35 ( contribution of @xmath35 might appear via @xmath36 ) .",

    ". therefore equation ( [ graph hamiltonian ] ) contain @xmath37 component of the magnetic field only . in this paper we interested in action of the external magnetic field",
    "directed at angle of graphene plane .",
    "therefore , we generalized gqhd equations including whole vector of magnetic field @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "we assumed that the pauli matrices satisfy the following commutation relation : @xmath43=2\\imath\\delta_{ij}\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}\\sigma^{\\gamma}_{i}.\\ ] ]    graphene is the 2d structure and electrons of graphene are located in the plane . as we describe above , in 2d case the electrons",
    "has two coordinate @xmath44 and @xmath45 , but spin of the electrons can be directed in all direction , particularly , in direction of @xmath37 axes , perpendicular to the graphene plane .",
    "this fact is accounted by formula ( [ graph comm rel ] ) .",
    "two projection of spin operator are contained in the hamiltonian ( [ graph hamiltonian ] ) , these are @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "spin operator projection on @xmath37 axis is appeared during derivation of the gqhd equations due to commutation relation ( [ graph comm rel ] ) .",
    "now , we present the derivation of model of the electron collective dynamics in graphene .",
    "as we mention above we describe the derivation of the mpqhd equations from equation ( [ graph hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the first step is we present the definition for density of probability for the conduction electron system in the physical space . @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "the quantity @xmath50 can be considered as the 2d concentration of the conductivity electrons . for studying of the time evolution of the concentration we differentiate the concentration ( [ graph def density ] ) with respect to time and use equation ( [ graph hamiltonian ] ) . in the result",
    ", we receive an equation which has the form of the continuity equation : @xmath51 where @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the quantity @xmath55 describes the spin density of the particle system .",
    "consequently , we have equation @xmath56 coordinate vector @xmath57 has only two component .",
    "consequently , equation ( [ graph cont with s ] ) contains two component of the spin density vector @xmath58 , these are @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "our next step in construction of the model of collective motion is obtaining of an equation for spin evolution .",
    "for this aim we differentiate the quantity @xmath55 with respect to time and use equation ( [ graph hamiltonian ] ) . because we known the third component of spin density vector we can study the evolution of all components of this vector .",
    "therefore , we derive equation of evolution for @xmath61 $ ] . on this way we have equation of the spin evolution : @xmath62 here new physical quantity is arisen : @xmath63 .",
    "the evident form of @xmath63 is @xmath64 @xmath65 this is the tensor of spin current .",
    "we study the 2d structures existing in 3d space .",
    "it leads to existence of @xmath37 component of vectors for several physical quantities , as for the spin density vector .",
    "the spin current @xmath63 is defined via two - vectors ( [ graph def of j mmm ] ) .",
    "these are the vector of spin @xmath66 and derivative vector operator @xmath67 , the last one is the vector with two components .",
    "therefore , we have the tensor @xmath63 whose first index take three value @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath37 , but the second index take two value @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "we have obtained two equation of the gqhd , it is equations ( [ graph cont with s ] ) and ( [ graph evolut of s ] ) .",
    "these equations significantly vary from the first two equations of the usual qhd  @xcite-  @xcite . in the usual qhd as in the classic hydrodynamics the first equation is the continuity equation where described the changing of number of particles in vicinity of the point of the physical space in consequence of the particles current . instead of that we obtain the connection of particles number changing and the spin density ( [ graph cont with s ] ) .    we have obtained the equation ( [ graph evolut of s ] ) instead of the momentum balance equation ( the euler equation ) in the usual qhd . the last one accounts the influence of particles interaction as each other and with the external fields .",
    "equation ( [ graph evolut of s ] ) does not contain information about the interaction .",
    "equation ( [ graph evolut of s ] ) differs from the usual equation of the spin evolution ( the bloch equation ) which contains the vector product of the spin density and magnetic field whose leads to the spin evolution .    at this step",
    "we have no closed set of two equations ( [ graph def density ] ) and ( [ graph evolut of s ] ) .",
    "thereto , received equations do not contain information about interaction .",
    "thus , basic model , presented by equation ( [ graph hamiltonian ] ) , contains the coulomb interaction between electrons .",
    "therefore , we have the series of equations which is an analogous to the bbgki series  @xcite ,  @xcite in the classic physical kinetics .",
    "we can obtain next equation of the series , namely equation of evolution for the tensor @xmath63 .",
    "this equation to be @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 equation ( [ graph evol jm ] ) contains interaction and two new quantities , these are @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "they are @xmath74 @xmath75 and @xmath76 @xmath77    equation ( [ graph evol jm ] ) is the first equation in system of the gqhd equations which contain the magnetic field . in equation",
    "( [ graph evol jm ] ) we have made generalization and consider all three component of the magnetic field instead of @xmath78 which presented in the hamiltonian ( [ graph hamiltonian ] ) .    the second rank tensor @xmath79 contains strength of the external magnetic field and gives contribution to the evolution of spin current . @xmath80 and @xmath81 do not include in equation ( [ graph hamiltonian ] ) , but they can make influence on particles dynamic .",
    "quantity @xmath82 is an analog of the current of probability or the momentum density in the usual qhd  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "this is very important physical quantity and we propose that our model must be complete by one more equation - the momentum balance equation . for derivation of the momentum balance equation , i.e. equation of evolution of @xmath82 , we apply the same method as used above .",
    "we differentiate @xmath82 with respect to time and use the equation ( [ graph hamiltonian ] ) . in the result",
    "we have @xmath83 @xmath84 equation ( [ graph evol of j ] ) is very similar to the euler equation in the usual qhd .",
    "but instead of the lorentz force we have vector product of the spin density and the magnetic field .",
    "equation ( [ graph evol of j ] ) , just as equation ( [ graph evol jm ] ) , contains interaction between particles .",
    "in fact equation ( [ graph evol of j ] ) is an analog of the euler equation in the usual qhd  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "obtained set of equations ( [ graph cont with s ] ) , ( [ graph evolut of s ] ) , ( [ graph evol jm ] ) and ( [ graph evol of j ] ) is not close because the set of equations contains quantity @xmath85 .",
    "we can obtain equation for @xmath85 , but in this way we will obtain new physical quantities .",
    "we need to make a closed set of the equations ( [ graph cont with s ] ) , ( [ graph evolut of s ] ) , ( [ graph evol jm ] ) and ( [ graph evol of j ] ) , expressing @xmath85 via physical quantities included in these equations . for closing the set of equations ( [ graph cont with s ] ) , ( [ graph evolut of s ] ) , ( [ graph evol jm ] ) and ( [ graph evol of j ] ) we use method of approximate calculations of the hydrodynamic variables developed in  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "following the paper  @xcite ,  @xcite we obtain @xmath86 @xmath87 where @xmath88 describes the contribution of the thermal motion , so , it is an analog of the tensor of kinetic pressure in the usual hydrodynamics . in this paper",
    "we do not account the thermal motion .",
    "consequently we suggest that @xmath88 is equal to zero .",
    "the last term in formula ( [ graph appr evid form pi ] ) is an analog of the quantum bohm potential ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "now , we have a closed system of the equations ( [ graph cont with s ] ) , ( [ graph evolut of s ] ) , ( [ graph evol jm ] ) , ( [ graph evol of j ] ) and ( [ graph appr evid form pi ] ) . using the gqhd equations ( [ graph cont with s ] ) , ( [ graph evolut of s ] ) , ( [ graph evol jm ] ) , ( [ graph evol of j ] ) and ( [ graph appr evid form pi ] ) we can study the collective excitations and they properties , i.e. dispersion dependence and increments of instabilities .",
    "developing method allows us to derive the energy balance equation which give us possibility to study the influence of the temperature on the graphene dynamics .      in last terms of equations ( [ graph evol jm ] ) and ( [ graph evol of j ] ) we have used the self - consistent field approximation . here",
    "we present general expressions for two - particle functions appeared in equations ( [ graph evol jm ] ) and ( [ graph evol of j ] ) , and also describe the meaning of the self - consistent approximation .",
    "this approximation was suggested by a. a. vlasov in 1938  @xcite for many - particle system of charged particles .",
    "the fig . [ selfcint01 ] presents the picture of the self - consistent interaction between charges particles .",
    "total charge of the region 2 interacts with the total charge of the region 1 . changing the extreme point of a radius vector ( or shifting the region 2 )",
    "we can scan whole space . in this way we obtain action of the external charges on the region 1 .",
    "changing position of the region 1 and repeating described operation we obtain action surrounding charges on each region of space .",
    "this is a picture of the self - consistent interaction in fixed moment of time and this picture governs an evolution of particles in system .",
    "this picture of interaction is typical for the classic physics , where we need to obtain smooth functions describing the collective motion .",
    "for that is necessary to average at physically infinitesimal volume ( sketched circle ) . in the quantum mechanics , the concentration , the spin density , the current density , etc ,",
    "are defined via wave function and we can consider described picture on interaction of separate particle instead of the space regions .",
    "the figure presents the picture of the self - consistent interaction in the system of charged particles.,width=302 ]    in general case the last terms in the equations ( [ graph evol jm ] ) and ( [ graph evol of j ] ) contain the two - particle function which in the self - consistent field approximation expressed via one particle functions and in this approximation we obtain a closed set of equations . in the equations ( [ graph evol jm ] ) and ( [ graph evol of j ] )",
    "the following two - particle functions were appeared .",
    "two - particle concentration @xmath89 @xmath90 is the average of the product of the concentration operators @xmath91 , where @xmath3 is the number of particles in the system .",
    "the quantity @xmath92 @xmath93 is the two - particle function of the concentration and the spin density @xmath94 .",
    "technically , the self - consistent field approximation corresponds to the factoring of the two - particle functions in product of one - particle ones : @xmath95 and @xmath96 it was used at derivation of the equations ( [ graph evol jm ] ) and ( [ graph evol of j ] ) .",
    "this approximation is suitable at consideration of the long - range interaction , particularly for the coulomb interaction .",
    "if we interest in more detail description of interaction we need to consider many - particle correlations . for example , for the two - particle concentration the correlation to be @xmath97 where @xmath98 includes a quantum correlation caused by exchange interaction .",
    "a method of correlation calculation was developed in ref.s  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "this method also can be used for the graphene description , and for it s further and more detailed studying .",
    "we consider the small perturbation of the equilibrium state like @xmath99 @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the external magnetic field , @xmath102 $ ] .    substituting these relations into system of the gqhd equations ( [ graph cont with s ] ) , ( [ graph evolut of s ] ) , ( [ graph evol jm ] ) , ( [ graph evol of j ] ) and ( [ graph appr evid form pi ] ) _ and _ neglecting by nonlinear terms , we obtain a system of linear equations with constant coefficients .    passing to the following representation for small perturbations @xmath103 @xmath104 yields the homogeneous system of algebraic equations    @xmath105",
    "@xmath106    @xmath107 @xmath108 and @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111 we assume that the spin density magnitude has a nonzero value .",
    "expressing all quantities entering in the set of equations in terms of the spin density , we get the equation @xmath112 where @xmath113 @xmath114 @xmath115 @xmath116 @xmath117 contribution of the coulomb interaction is presented by the last term in the dispersion matrix @xmath118 .    in the absence of external magnetic field",

    "in this section we consider dispersion properties of waves in graphene placed in the external magnetic field which parallel or perpendicular to the @xmath124 plane , we suppose that graphene is located in the @xmath124 plane .",
    "we begin this chapter with the consideration of equation @xmath125    for the magnetic field perpendicular to the graphene plane @xmath126 from ( [ graph disp eq with mg field lxy in gen ] ) we have @xmath127 it is the same result as in the absence of the external field .",
    "suggesting what @xmath128 we can admit that equation ( [ graph disp eq with mg field lxy in gen ] ) contains terms proportional to @xmath129 and @xmath130 . considering the limit of approximately small in - plane magnetic field @xmath129 we can neglect by the terms proportional to the @xmath130 . in the result",
    "we find an equation which is the equation of eight degree of @xmath131 .",
    "however , at the considering values of the parameters of the system we get that this equation has two solutions only .",
