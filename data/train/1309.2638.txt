    "fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) systems represent the paradigm for interacting topological states of matter .",
    "much attention has been concentrated on the topological properties of the quantum hall states , encoded in the ground state wavefunction and the statistics of quasiparticle excitations . on the other hand",
    ", fqh systems also have a neutral collective excitation known as the magneto - roton .",
    "the magneto - roton is an excitation within one landau level and hence has energy at the interaction ( coulomb ) energy scale .",
    "the existence of the magneto - roton was suggested in the classic work of girvin , macdonald , and platzman  @xcite , in which feynman s theory of the roton in superfluid helium is extended to the fqh case . in this picture",
    "the magneto - roton is visualized as a long - wavelength density fluctuation . within the composite fermion theory ,",
    "the magneto - roton is interpreted as a particle - hole bound state , in which the particle lies in an empty composite - fermion landau level , and the hole lies in a filled one . in the composite - boson approach , the magneto - roton is interpreted as vortex - antivortex bound state .",
    "the magneto - roton has been observed in raman scattering experiments  @xcite and more recently , in experiments using surface acoustic waves  @xcite . at nonzero wavenumbers",
    ", there is some evidence in favor of more than one magneto - roton mode  @xcite .",
    "very recently , haldane has proposed a drastically different interpretation of the magneto - roton  @xcite .",
    "he argues that there is a dynamic degree of freedom in fqh systems which can be interpreted as an internal metric . in this picture , the magneto - roton at long wavelength is the quantum of the fluctuations of this metric .    in this paper , we derive some new results related to the physics of a gapped fqh system at the lowest landau level ( @xmath7 ) at the interaction energy scale .",
    "we assume that the coulomb energy is much smaller than the cyclotron energy .",
    "first , we derive new , exact sum rules involving the spectral densities of the traceless part of the stress tensor .",
    "the two components of the traceless part of the stress tensor are @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( here @xmath10 ) , hence we can define two spectral densities : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the total number of particles in the system , @xmath13 is the ground state and the sums are taken over all excited states @xmath14 . physically , these spectral densities are proportional to the probability that a circularly polarized graviton with energy @xmath15 falling perpendicularly to the system is absorbed .",
    "the two functions correspond to the two circular polarizations of the graviton . without a complete solution to the fqh problem",

    "the integral in each sum rule is dominated by @xmath15 of the order of the coulomb energy .",
    "the sum rule   is particularly interesting , as it establishes a connection between a topological characteristic of the ground state ( the shift ) and dynamic information ( the spectral densities ) . in the @xmath27",
    "integer quantum hall state , the sum rule becomes trivial , as there is no degree of freedom at the interaction energy scale ( hence @xmath28 ) , and the shift is @xmath29 , so both sides of the sum rule vanish .",
    "using the three sum rules , we derive some inequalities between different observables in the fqh states . one of these inequalities , previously derived by haldane  @xcite , places a lower bound on the coefficient of the @xmath3 asymptotics of the projected static structure factor , which is saturated by the laughlin s trial wavefunction .    we will also consider a simple model where the sum rules are saturated by one magneto - roton mode , which manifests as the oscillation of the internal metric of the fluid mixed with the hydrodynamic fluid motion .",
    "the model provides a concrete realization of haldane s idea of an internal metric degree of freedom in fqh systems  @xcite .",
    "this model is not meant to be exact , however it does exhibit some of the characteristic properties of the observed magneto - roton modes .",
    "we discuss the polarization properties of the magneto - roton in this model , which may be measurable in future experiments .",
    "recently , one of the authors has proposed the use of nonrelativistic general coordinate invariance as a way to constrain the dynamics of quantum hall systems  @xcite ( for related work , see refs .",
    "although the method can be thought of as `` gauging '' the galilean invariance , the local symmetry remains nontrivial in the limit of zero bare electron mass , and hence is a symmetry intrinsic to the physics of electrons at the lowest landau level , coupled to electromagnetism and gravity .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the attention was focused on the regime of long wavelengths ( much larger than the magnetic length ) and low frequencies ( much smaller than the gap ) . in this paper",
    "we will relax the latter condition , allowing for energies comparable to the gap . in this regime , terms with arbitrary number of time derivatives",
    "must be taken into account in the effective action .",
    "however , as we will demonstrate , we can still obtain nontrivial relationships by expanding in the number of spatial derivatives .",
    "we briefly review the main result of ref .",
    "@xcite here .",
    "the effective lagrangian describing the response of a gapped quantum hall state to external electromagnetic ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) and gravitational perturbations ( @xmath32 ) , in the massless limit , is : @xmath33.\\ ] ] here @xmath34 ; @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are dynamical fields , with respect to which one should extremize the action ; and @xmath38 is related to the external electromagnetic potential by : @xmath39 @xmath40 is the spin connection of the newton - cartan space @xmath41 , defined through the derivatives of the vielbein @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) : @xmath44 finally , @xmath45 contains all `` non - universal '' terms , i.e. , terms that can not be fixed by symmetry arguments alone .",
    "there are two parameters that enter the lagrangian  : @xmath20 , which is identified with the filling factor , and @xmath46 , identified with the orbital spin ( per particle ) and is related to the shift by @xmath47 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that these two parameters control some quantities , most notably the @xmath48 part of the hall conductivity at zero frequency ( @xmath49 being the wavenumber of the perturbation ) .",
    "it was also found in ref .",
    "@xcite that most physical quantities , e.g. , the same @xmath48 part of the hall conductivity , but calculated at nonzero frequency , are not fixed by @xmath20 and @xmath46 alone .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath3 term in the density - density correlation function .",
    "physically , these quantities depend crucially on the physics happening at the coulomb energy scale  @xmath50 .",
    "the physics of the gapped excitations is contained in the non - universal part of the lagrangian @xmath45 .",
    "terms in @xmath45 can be organized in a series over powers of derivatives .",
    "we will be interested in the physics at long wavelengths , @xmath51 .",
    "the expansion parameter in frequency would be @xmath52 , however since we are interested in physical phenomena at the scale @xmath50 , we need to keep terms to all orders in time derivatives .",
    "a consistent power counting scheme is to consider fluctuations of the metric @xmath32 and the gauge potentials @xmath30 , @xmath31 as @xmath53 , and expand in powers of the spatial derivatives . in this work , we will be interested only in the response of the quantum hall systems to _ unimodular _ metric perturbations , i.e. , those in which the perturbed metric @xmath32 has determinant equal to one , and to perturbations of the scalar potential @xmath30 , i.e. , perturbations corresponding to a longitudinal electric field , without changing the magnetic field . in this case , the lowest non - trivial terms entering @xmath45 are @xmath54 .",
    "these we parameterize , without loss of generality is of higher order , because fluctuations of @xmath36 are of order @xmath3 , as evident from eq .",
    "( [ sbar ] ) below .",

    "we will work only to quadratic order , hence we only need to know the leading terms in the spatial components of the shear tensor : @xmath66 the quadratic part of the lagrangian is then : @xmath67.\\ ] ]    here , for any symmetric traceless tensors @xmath68 we define @xmath69 which is again a symmetric traceless tensor .",
    "it is also easy to show @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we now relate the two functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 to the spectral densities of the stress tensor @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the two - point function of the stress tensor can be read directly from the action , and is simplest for the traceless components at zero spatial momentum .",
    "after a simple calculation we get : @xmath74 the spectral densities defined in eqs .   and are related to @xmath75 and @xmath76 by : @xmath77 where we have extended the definition of the spectral densities to negative @xmath15 s by requiring @xmath78 .",
    "the functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 are regular in the @xmath79 limits , and as we shall explain below [ see eqs .",
    "( [ omega2 g ] ) and ( [ omega2f ] ) ] they should both fall as @xmath80 when @xmath81 . from these behaviors we can write down the spectral representations of @xmath75 and @xmath76 : @xmath82    the hall viscosity , as a function of frequency , can be related through a kubo s formula to the parity - odd part of the two - point function of the stress tensor  @xcite . we find : @xmath83 at @xmath79 this equation gives the relationship between the ( zero - frequency ) hall viscosity and the shift : @xmath84 . at frequencies much larger than @xmath50 ,",
    "interactions can be neglected and the hall viscosity is determined completely by the berry phase of each orbital under homogeneous metric deformation . the computation of the high - frequency hall viscosity ( where `` high '' means frequencies much larger than the coulomb energy scale , but still much smaller than the cyclotron energy ) proceeds in exactly the same way as in the integer quantum hall case  @xcite , and the result is @xmath85 .",
    "thus we find : @xmath86 and using eq .",
    "( [ g - disp ] ) we derive our first sum rule : @xmath87 = \\frac{\\mathcal s-1}8.\\ ] ]      we now derive two sum rules involving the sum of the two spectral densities @xmath88 .",
    "computing the two - point function of the density from the action from   and , we find : @xmath89 integrating both sides over @xmath15 , we get : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the projected static structure factor  @xcite .",
    "the reason we get the projected structure factor instead of the unprojected one is that we are working in the limit of zero band mass , and so when we took the integral over @xmath15 , implicitly we have assumed that upper limit of integration is still much smaller than the cyclotron frequency @xmath92 . by using eq .",
    "( [ f - disp ] ) , we find the second sum rule : @xmath93    = s_4,\\ ] ] where @xmath94 .",
    "the third sum rule again comes from the stress response at large @xmath15 . for this purpose , it is convenient to describe the motion of the fluid in terms of the displacement @xmath95 , which is related to the velocity by @xmath96 .",
    "the @xmath75 term in the action now reads : @xmath97 ^ 2.\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath98 , the @xmath76 term , having an extra time derivative , does not contribute to the energy .",
    "hence , we are left with only the @xmath75 contribution above , which takes the exact same form as the the deformation energy of a solid , with the shear modulus @xmath5 given by : @xmath99 using the spectral representation of @xmath57 in , we find : @xmath100    = \\frac{\\mu_\\infty}{\\rho_0}\\,.\\ ] ]    the high - frequency shear modulus @xmath5 was introduced in the phenomenological model of refs .",
    "we now give the precise meaning of this constant . from our discussion , we know that @xmath5 characterizes the stress response of the system under uniform metric perturbations with frequencies much higher than the coulomb energy scale , but much lower than the cyclotron energy .",
    "since at these frequencies the coulomb interaction between electrons can be ignored , each particle evolves independently under such a perturbation .",
    "the orbital of each electron is continuously deformed and projected down to the lowest landau level . in this way",
    ", we can completely determine the wavefunction of the deformed state from that of the the ground state .",
    "for example , consider a metric perturbation in which the @xmath101 coordinate is stretched by a factor of @xmath102 while the @xmath103 coordinate compressed by @xmath104 .",
    "if we denote the ground state wave function as : @xmath105 the deformed state @xmath106 is obtained by replacing @xmath107 by @xmath108 , @xmath109 f(z_i).\\ ] ] if we now use laughlin s wavefunction to substitute for @xmath107 above , the deformed states that we obtain coincide exactly with the ones recently considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the energy of these states is a function of @xmath110 with minimum at @xmath111 , and the high - frequency shear modulus is simply the curvature of this function at the minimum : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the total area of the system .",
    "equations  ( [ muinf - def ] ) and ( [ falpha ] ) define the constant @xmath5 appearing in the sum rule  ( [ elasticity - sr ] ) .",
    "the sum rules have important implications .",
    "first , since @xmath72 and @xmath73 are non - negative spectral densities , comparing eqs .   and , we obtain the following inequality between @xmath4 and @xmath2 : @xmath114 this inequality has been previously derived by haldane  @xcite . for laughlin s fractions  @xmath115  @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and the inequality becomes @xmath118 . remarkably , the laughlin wavefunction has @xmath4 saturating the lower bound . hence ,",
    "if the laughlin wavefunction was the true wavefunction of the ground state , that would imply @xmath119 for all  @xmath15 .",
    "read and rezayi  @xcite argued that the inequality  ( [ s4-lowerbound ] ) is actually an equality for all lowest - landau - level ground states with rotational invariance . from our derivation , we do not expect the equality to hold generally : the spectral density @xmath73 need not necessarily vanish .",
    "nevertheless , the laughlin wavefunction seems to be a very good approximation to the true wavefunction of the coulomb potential , thus it is possible that for the true ground state of the coulomb problem , @xmath73 is numerically much smaller than @xmath72 .",
    "finally , we can also put a lower bound on the energy gap @xmath16 at @xmath17 .",
    "the energy gap may correspond not to a single quasiparticle , but , for example , to a pair of magneto - rotons , in which case @xmath16 is the start of a continuum .",
    "the inequality that follows from comparing the sum rules and is : @xmath120 where equality would be achieved only when @xmath72 and @xmath73 are proportional to @xmath121 .",
    "the equality in this case has the same form as the girvin - macdonald - platzman variational formula for the magneto - roton energy , but in contrast to the latter , both the numerator and the denominator in our formula are finite in the limit @xmath122 .    by combining these two inequalities",
    "we can also write : @xmath123 which saturates under the conditions @xmath119 and @xmath124 .",
    "we now present a simple model where the sum rules are satisfied by construction and are dominated by one single mode which is identified with the magneto - roton . to start",
    ", we adapt the lagrangian formulation of fluid dynamics  @xcite , in which the degrees of freedom of the quantum hall fluids are the lagrangian coordinates @xmath125 , @xmath126 . the density and velocity of the fluid",
    "are given by : @xmath127 such that the divergence of the current vanishes identically .",
    "the theory is required to be invariant under volume - preserving diffeomorphisms in the @xmath128 space . imposing this condition sets the shape modulus to zero , thereby ensuring that our action describes a fluid and not a solid .",
    "the degree of freedom saturating the sum rules , is assumed to be a unimodular metric tensor @xmath129 .",
    "physically , one should think of @xmath129 as parameterizing the anisotropic deformation of the ground state , as constructed in section [ sec : shear_mod ] . in this model , @xmath129 is the only dynamical degree of freedom at the coulomb energy scale .    the theory can either be written in @xmath101 space , treating @xmath128 as functions of @xmath130 and @xmath131 , or in @xmath132 space , where the dynamical fields are @xmath133 .",
    "the action of the model is the sum of three parts @xmath134 , where the first part is written in @xmath101 space : @xmath135 this has the same form as the the universal part of the action derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , but with @xmath46 replaced by @xmath136 .",
    "the reason for this replacement is that we expect @xmath137 to encode the hall viscosity at high frequency , but not at low frequency .",
    "the second part of the action is written in @xmath132 space .",
    "it is a wess - zumino - witten action : @xmath138 where as a function of @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , and @xmath110 is a parameter that will be fixed later .",
    "although the action is written as an integral in @xmath139 space , one can check that the action depends only on the boundary value at @xmath142 , but is independent of the interpolation between @xmath143 and @xmath142 .",
    "it is identical to the action considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .    finally , in @xmath144 we include the potential energy , which depends on the density and one parameter characterizing the eccentricity of the deformation : @xmath145 we only consider small perturbations around the ground state ; we take : @xmath146 and @xmath147 . ignoring the constant term , total derivatives and terms proportional to squares of @xmath148 and @xmath149 , which are small in the regime",
    "we are considering , we have : @xmath150 now we introduce the variable @xmath151 as : @xmath152 using @xmath153 we can rewrite the quadratic action in the form of eq .   where @xmath154 is given by : @xmath155 after integrating out @xmath151 , @xmath45 reduces to the form  ( [ l0-fg ] ) , with functions @xmath75 and @xmath76 given by : @xmath156 this corresponds exactly to the spectral functions @xmath157 and @xmath119 . in particular , @xmath158 and",
    "the inequality  ( [ s4-lowerbound ] ) becomes an equality in this model .",
    "we reiterate the form of the effective lagrangian in flat space - time and in the massless limit : @xmath159 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are given in eq . and",
    "the function @xmath160 denotes interaction energy of the hall state and depends only on the particle density .",
    "we are interested in the dispersion relation of the magneto - roton excitations . to this end , we linearize the equations of motion and turn on perturbations about the ground state : @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the ground state electron density and @xmath163 are small perturbations . we further assume that the energy arises purely from pairwise interactions with the form : @xmath164 for the sake of definiteness , we work with the coulomb potential with a strength parameter @xmath165 defined as : @xmath166 it should be noted that even though the specifics of the calculation depend on the exact form of the chosen potential , the qualitative behavior that we derive here is independent of such details , so long as the potential remains repulsive .    in what follows",
    "we set @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "we note that the parameter @xmath110 used in the non - universal functions @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( see eq . )",
    "is fixed by our first sum rule given in eq . :",
    "also , as noted previously , the inequality is saturated in this model .",
    "we find the dispersion relation of the magneto - roton mode to be : @xmath170 which exhibits the properties of the magneto - roton with a downward slope at small @xmath171 which turns around after a characteristic minimum ( fig [ dis ] ) .     and",
    "minimum dispersion appears at @xmath173 . ]",
    "for the purpose of comparison , we also report this this dispersion relation up to fourth order in momentum expansion : @xmath174.\\ ] ] note that the coefficient in front of @xmath175 is , for laughlin s fractions , @xmath176 , which is also seen in the model of ref .",
    "however , we can not argue that this coefficient is universal .",
    "for example , the coefficient will change if we add to the action  ( [ l - gamma2 ] ) a term proportional to the square of the spatial gradients of @xmath151 .",
    "there is one more interesting feature of this mode that reveals itself under closer inspection . from the equations of motion",
    ", we can derive that the eigenmodes satisfy : @xmath177 where @xmath178 and @xmath179 given in .",
    "if we decompose @xmath180 into a parallel component @xmath181 and a perpendicular component @xmath182 to the direction of momentum @xmath183 , we find that @xmath184 .",
    "using the dispersion relation  , and the explicit form of @xmath185 , we see that the value of @xmath186 evolves from @xmath187 to @xmath188 and finally to @xmath189 ( fig [ pol ] ) .",
    "this implies that , from the point of view of current pattern , the excitations exhibit counterclockwise rotation at small momenta , which turns into a linear oscillation in direction of @xmath190 in the vicinity of the magneto - roton minimum and finally develops into clockwise rotation at large values of the momentum .",
    "it would be interesting to understand if this feature of the magneto - roton may be detected experimentally .    , with @xmath191 , @xmath172 .",
    "linear polarization appears at @xmath192 . ]",
    "here we only briefly discuss the implication of the model for the observation of the magneto - roton at low momentum in raman scattering experiments .",
    "in previous theoretical treatments  @xcite , it was assumed that the magneto - roton is excited chiefly through the coupling of electric field to density : @xmath193 .",
    "this coupling , however , implies that the intensity of the magneto - roton peak should scale as the fourth power of the magneto - roton momentum , @xmath3 . in experiments ,",
    "magneto - roton was seen down to even the lowest momenta  @xcite , a fact that may be attributed to disorders violating momentum conservation .",
    "however , we can not rule out a coupling of the type @xmath194 from symmetry consideration , with @xmath195 being the stress tensor . even if the coefficient in front of this term is small",
    ", it would dominate the intensity of magneto - roton peak in the limit @xmath122 , since the residue at the pole in in @xmath196 correlators remains finite in this limit .",
    "this coupling thus provides an alternative explanation of the observation of the magneto - roton at lowest momenta in raman scattering experiments .",
    "moreover , in our model at @xmath17 the magneto - roton is circularly polarized with angular momentum 2 .",
    "we suggest that the polarization of the magneto - roton at @xmath17 may be detectable by raman scattering with polarized light .",
    "in this paper we looked at gapped fractional quantum hall states with filling factors @xmath7 in the regime where the coulomb energy is much smaller than the cyclotron energy , however with energies comparable to that of the gap .",
    "we developed three sum rules involving the spectral densities of the stress tensor which we then used to verify haldane s conjectured lower bound on the quartic coefficient of the structure factor @xmath197 , as well as introduce other inequalities .",
    "we also introduced a simple model that saturates these inequalities via a mode which arises from the mixing between the oscillations of an internal metric and the hydrodynamic excitations .",
    "we identifed this mode as the magneto - roton and calculated its dispersion relation .",
    "we argued that the intensity of the magneto - roton line in raman scattering experiments should not vanish at zero momentum , and that the magneto - roton at @xmath17 is a spin-2 object .",
    "finally , we suggest that the spin of the magneto - roton can be determined by raman scattering with polarized light .",
