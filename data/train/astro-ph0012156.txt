    "two paradigms are commonly used to explain the formation of the central bulges of disk galaxies . in the first , the bulge forms prior to the disk , perhaps as part or an aftermath of the formation of the stellar halo ( gilmore & wyse 1998 ) , or as a result of early merging resulting in an @xmath4 spheroid around which a new thin disk forms from surrounding gas ( eg .",
    "kauffmann , guiderdoni & white 1994 ) . in the second , bulges form and grow after bar instabilities draw disk stars and gas to the center ( pfenniger & norman 1990 ) .",
    "details about these paradigms are given in the review by wyse , gilmore & franx ( 1997 ) .",
    "bouwens , cayn & silk ( 1999 ) perform a comparative test of these hypotheses .",
    "what is the role of interactions , mergers and accretion of satellites in the functioning of these processes ? .",
    "satellite accretion must have occurred several times in a disk galaxy over a hubble time . while mergers of galaxies with similar mass fully destroy the disk ( eg .",
    "barnes & hernquist 1991 ) and leave remnants resembling an elliptical galaxy , satellite accretion does less damage to the disk ; and , if the satellite is dense enough , it must reach the galaxy center .",
    "the accretion in this case may drive the growth of the central bulge .",
    "several studies have addressed whether mergers are responsible for pushing a spiral galaxy along the hubble sequence toward sa / s0 ( eg . walker et al 1996 ) .",
    "mergers must have been efficient in groups and in the field ; in the cluster environment , disk cosmological fading due to the evaporation of neutral gas , the cluster tidal field ( dubinski 1998 ) and occasional galaxy - galaxy encounters ( moore et al .",
    "1996 ) contribute as well to the growing prominence of the bulge .",
    "satellite accretion onto disk galaxies has been extensively studied in the past using n body techniques .",
    "the focus of these studies have been the thickening of the disk ( quinn & goodman 1986 , tth & ostriker 1992 , quinn , hernquist & fullagar 1993 , hereafter qhf93 , walker et al 1996 , huang & carlberg 1997 ) , the formation of counterrotating disks in spirals ( thakar & ryden 1996 ) , the formation of x structures in s0 galaxies ( mihos et al .",
    "1995 ) , and the triggering of nuclear starbursts ( mihos & hernquist 1994 ) .",
    "diagnostics related to the central bulge are largely ignored .",
    "indeed , except for the latter paper , none of the studies mentioned above include a central bulge in their initial galaxy model , a bold simplification given that the potential of the central bulge is a key ingredient of the merger dynamics of both stars ( hernquist 1993 ) and gas ( mihos & hernquist 1994 ) .",
    "sufficient data exists nowadays on bulges ( balcells & peletier 1994 , hereafter bp94 , peletier & balcells 1996 , 1997 , peletier et al .",
    "1999 , carollo 1999 , de jong 1996 , prieto et al . 1999 ,",
    "ratnatunga , griffiths & ostrander 1998 , schade et al .",
    "1996 , abraham et al . 1999 ,",
    "marleau & simard 1998 ) to allow the structure and dynamics of bulges to be used as constraints on the accretion history of disk galaxies .",
    "however , no detailed studies of the growth of bulges by accretion of satellites have been published to date .    in this paper",
    "we study whether the shape of the surface brightness profiles of bulges changes with the merger history of spiral galaxies .",
    "andredakis , peletier & balcells ( 1995 , hereafter apb95 ) show that bulges follow a systematic behavior in the @xmath1 vs. t plane , where @xmath1 is the exponent index in sersic s law @xmath0 , and t is the galaxy type index given eg . in the rc3 .",
    "apb95 find that @xmath1 is 46 in early , s0 types , decreasing to @xmath5 for late types ( sc ) .",
    "the apb95 result could result from the effect of the disk potential on a bulge initially following an @xmath4 law , in an scenario in which the bulge forms prior to the disk .",
    "andredakis ( 1998 ) studies the adiabatic growth of a disk onto an existing @xmath4 spheroid , and finds that the disk potential does modify the bulge surface brightness profile , lowering the @xmath1 in the exponent of sersic s law .",
    "but the mechanism saturates at @xmath6 , showing that exponential bulges ( @xmath7 ) can not be produced by adiabatic growth of the disk around an @xmath4 bulge .    that merging is an efficient way to generate @xmath4 surface brightness profiles is well - known ( gerhard 1981 ; barnes 1988 ) .",
    "we may thus conjecture that the behavior found by apb95 reflects the effects of the relaxation in an scenario of bulge growth by accretion . here",
    "we address the following question : assuming that bulges are formed with exponential profiles , does the accretion of dense satellites simultaneously drive the growth of the bulge mass and the evolution of the bulge surface density profile toward higher-@xmath1 sersic law shapes ?",
    "in cosmological models of galaxy formation involving gas and stars , central bulges show characteristic exponential surface density profiles ( domnguez - tenreiro et al .",
    "1999 ) , suggesting that bulges may start out with exponential profiles , and that any changes are imprints of subsequent evolution . to test the bulge growth conjecture we consider disk - bulge - halo galaxy models for which the bulge surface brightness profile is initially exponential , and fit sersic s law to the bulge surface brightness profile after an accretion of a satellite",
    "we then draw `` growth vectors '' in the @xmath1 vs. t plane .",
    "our results suggest that accretion of dense satellites is efficient in turning exponential bulges into @xmath8 bulges .",
    "after the merger , the @xmath1 index of sersic s law increases proportional to the satellite mass .",
    "it reaches @xmath9 for a satellite as massive as the original bulge .",
    "our models suggest that this result is largely independent of the internal structure of the satellite , as long as the satellite is dense enough to reach the center undisrupted .",
    "we quantity disk thickening .",
    "we concur with other studies of spiral galaxy evolution via merging , that only if the thin disk is rebuilt after the accretion can we match real galaxies .",
    "we analyze the kinematic structure of the merger remnants to provide additional tests of the model . for direct mergers , the rotation curve shapes are steeper for more massive bulges , consistent with observations .",
    "massive satellites on retrograde orbits result in counterrotating bulges , suggesting either that massive accretion events are rare , or that accretion preferentially occurs on prograde orbits .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "description of the columns : ( 3 ) bulge effective surface density , ( 4 ) bulge effective radius , ( 5 ) bulge profile index , ( 6 ) disk central intensity , ( 7 ) disk scale length , ( 8) bulge - to - disk final mass ratio as derived from the sersic plus exponential double fit .    the lack of bulge initial rotation and the higher density of the satellite both contribute to making counterrotation more prevalent in the models than they are likely to be in reality , and it is not a prediction of our models that half of all bulges should contain counterrotating components . quantifying merger - induced bulge counterrotation will require a comprehensive set of simulations that include a realistic distribution of satellite orbit orientations ( zaritsky et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the accretion of dense satellites is less effective in making the bulge s effective radius @xmath10 grow than it is at making the disk scale length @xmath11 grow ( table  [ tab : fitresults ] from absorption of orbital energy and angular momentum .",
    "the decrease of @xmath12 with each merger is at odds with the observed increase of @xmath12 toward early types in real galaxies ( graham & prieto 1999 ) .",
    "two explanations for this mismatch are possible .",
    "first we note that the dense satellites deposit most of their mass in the center of the bulge , while the low density model ( ld1 ) deposits all of its mass outside the bulge .",
    "we may envision that for intermediate density satellites the mass is deposited throughout the bulge driving a stronger increase in the bulge s @xmath10 .",
    "second , we discuss below that the surviving disk in in fact a thick disk . de grijs & peletier ( 1997 ) measure the scale lengths of thick and thin disks in edge - on galaxies , showing that @xmath13 .",
    "this may explain that @xmath12 decreases in our models , where @xmath14 , while it increases in real galaxies , where @xmath15 .",
    "the disks thicken during the process .",
    "the exact values shown in fig .",
    "10 are sensitive to the choice of energy and inclination of the initial orbits , with higher thickening expected of more inclined , and more energetic , orbits .",
    "discussion of the disk vertical heating effects are beyond the scope of this paper , and are extensively addressed in eg .",
    "our thickening results are similar to theirs , and may be interpreted as indicating that the merger contributes to the growth of a thick disk . lowering the satellite mass to reduce",
    "the impact on the disk helps a bit .",
    "our low - mass satellites impart less damage to the disk .",
    "but their effect on the surface density of the bulge is also limited ( @xmath3 to @xmath16 ) .",
    "it is plausible , but not obvious a priori , that a sequence of such mergers may drive @xmath1 to keep growing . lowering",
    "the satellite mass even further is of limited use , as dynamical friction becomes inefficient .",
    "satellites with mass 0.1 times the bulge mass have merger times approaching one hubble time .",
    "we ran a multi - merger case in which 10 satellites with mass 0.1 times the bulge mass evolved around the disk galaxy .",
    "weak dynamical friction and satellite - satellite interactions prevented the merger over one hubble time .",
    "therefore , disk thickening is probably unavoidable , and , because we start out with an already formed disk , the present scenario of bulge growth is variation on the `` bulge before the disk '' theme .",
    "indeed , for such galaxy to match present day disk galaxies , a thin disk must be rebuilt out of the gas remaining after the last merger .",
    "the formation of the thick disk is itself not a problem for this scenario , as thick disks are present in early type disk galaxies and absent in late - types ( de grijs & peletier 1997 ) .",
    "merger - driven bulge formation prior to the disk ( e.g. kauffmann et al . 1994 ) is at odds with the fact that sc and later - type spirals have exponential bulges : our experiments indicate that exponential bulges are extremely fragile against accretion and merging .",
    "the seeds of the central bulges of spiral galaxies must be given by events unrelated to accretion of smaller galaxies .",
    "the efficiency of the increase of @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nvsmrat ] ) places limits on the fractional growth of @xmath17 bulges by collisionless accretion of dense satellites .",
    "our results suggest that collisionless accretion of dense satellites bear the signature of a non - exponential bulge surface density profile .",
    "such signature lends itself to tests requiring imaging data only , hence can be be used to constrain the merger history of galaxies at high cosmological distances .",
    "the collisionless accretion of dense satellites onto disk galaxies drives the growth of the bulge and an increase in the @xmath1 index of the sersic fit to the bulge surface density profile .",
    "the mass of the bulge and @xmath1 grow proportional to the satellite mass . a single merger with a satellite as massive as the bulge forms an @xmath4 bulge . the range of @xmath1 values obtained in the models",
    "matches that observed in bulges by apb95 , which points at accretion as a simple way of setting up the apb95 relation .",
    "these results support the idea that bulges of late type spirals which show exponential surface brightness profiles can evolve to bulges of early type galaxies with @xmath18 by mergers with satellites galaxies .",
    "the models predict that thick disks form as by - products of the evolution toward larger b / d , in accordance with the presence of thick disks in s0 and sa disk galaxies .",
    "matching to present day galaxies requires the rebuilding of a thin disk out of remaining gas .",
