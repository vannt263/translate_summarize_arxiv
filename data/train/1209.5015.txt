    "ocean waves generate noise in a wide range of acoustic frequencies @xmath0 .",
    "the upper end of the spectrum , @xmath1  hz , is dominated by wave breaking and associated bubbles , whereas the lower frequency part , nominally @xmath2  hz is mostly expected to be caused by the nonlinearity of the hydrodynamic equations , on which we focus here .",
    "the general sound generation by fluid flows was described theoretically by @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed how seismic waves can be generated by the same process , with noise radiating along the earth s crust in the form of rayleigh waves .",
    "that theory was extended to random waves by @xcite , and later cast in the more general framework of wave - wave interactions @xcite .",
    "work on compressible flows has also been extended to the study of tsunamis . in that context",
    ", @xcite discussed the compressibility effect on gravity modes , which we will call here acoustic - gravity modes , and the gravity effect in seismic pseudo - rayleigh waves , that we will refer to as rayleigh modes .",
    "interest in seismic noise has risen sharply over the last few years with the enforcement of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty , and motivated by the work of who demonstrated that seismic noise correlation could provide a unique monitoring method for the properties of the solid earth .",
    "recent numerical models based on the longuet - higgins  hasselmann ( lh - h ) theory for rayleigh wave generation have shown good agreement of modeled seismic noise spectra with observations .",
    "it is still unclear whether most of the uncertainties on the modeled noise level can be attributed to errors in the seismic sources , associated with a poorly constrained directional distribution of the ocean surface wave spectrum , or to errors in the seismic propagation .",
    "seismic observations have also revealed body waves , for which no complete theory has been proposed to date .",
    "@xcite did propose a theory for compressional ( @xmath3 ) waves , but he did not consider the important effect of the water layer .",
    "further , the generation of love waves , which are surface shear waves polarized in the horizontal direction , is not well understood .",
    "these love waves are particularly important for frequencies below 0.02 hz or above 1  hz . the low frequency love waves may be excited by the direct action of long surface gravity waves ( known as infragravity waves ) , on a sloping bottom , in a way similar to the generation of primary microseisms described by @xcite . here",
    "we narrow the scope of our investigation and only consider non - linear wave - wave interactions , which leads to noise with frequencies double that of the surface gravity waves .",
    "finally , the level of acoustic noise has also been explored as a potential source of information on the poorly known directional spectrum of short gravity waves . and showed a large variability of the spectral level in the frequency range 0.150  hz that is clearly related to the sea state .",
    "their interpretation of the data , following previous studies of underwater noise , is based on sound generated by waves in an unbounded ocean .",
    "although this simplified approach is reasonable for high frequency noise , the neglected reflection from the seafloor and subsequent reverberations in the bounded ocean may strongly amplify the lower frequency resonant modes .    given the renewal of interest in seismic and acoustic noise",
    ", we found it appropriate to revisit hasselmann s theory .",
    "we thus illustrate , correct , and add a few missing aspects .",
    "these corrections include important terms for intermediate and shallow water that have not been considered before for the compressible conditions , although they were verified in the incompressible limit .",
    "the compressible equations of motion are used to derive a consistent solution in terms of gravity , acoustic and seismic modes , including both surface rayleigh waves and compressional ( p ) or shear ( s ) body waves .",
    "this solution for body waves has not been given before .    ) , and the shear ( @xmath4 ) and compression ( @xmath5 ) speeds in the crust . from slow to fast , there are the acoustic - gravity ( ag ) domain , the rayleigh ( r ) wave domain , and two body wave domains ( @xmath6 only , and @xmath3 and @xmath6 together ) ( b ) for any fixed frequency , the four domains correspond to 4 concentric regions in the wavenumber plane . for three selected noise frequencies generated by osgw in the infragravity , dominant and high frequency ranges of the forcing wave field ,",
    "the limiting wavelengths between the four domains are indicated , using @xmath7  km / s , @xmath8  km / s , @xmath9  km / s .",
    "one example of interaction ( black vectors ) is shown with two gravity wave modes that interact to generate a rayleigh wave . ]",
    "building on the seismo - acoustic paradigm proposed by , the basic idea of the present paper is that all modes of motion can be excited by ocean surface gravity waves ( osgw ) of any frequency . for a given pair of interacting frequencies @xmath10 and @xmath11 ,",
    "the frequency of the generated noise is @xmath12 , and the different types of waves are only distinguished by their phase velocity , or equivalently by their horizontal wavenumber @xmath13 which is the norm of the vector sum of the wave numbers , @xmath14 of the interacting oswg , as shown in figure [ fig:4domains ] .",
    "this type of wave - wave interaction is one of the lowest order interactions @xcite .    in the physical space",
    ", one such interaction excites waves with horizontal wavelength @xmath15 , and different vertical patterns in the atmosphere , ocean and crust , due to the very different speeds for compression waves in these three media .",
    "figure [ fig : pressure_field ] shows how the same forcing can give almost vertical - propagating waves in the atmosphere , waves that propagate almost horizontally in the ocean , and evanescent waves in the crust .",
    "the analysis of a pair of interacting wave - trains is key to our interpretation of the different noise modes .",
    "the broad - banded wave spectrum of ocean waves results in the superposition of all possible pairs of osgw waves trains , and thus all possible noise waves propagating or evanescent , that radiate in all directions .",
    "this broad spectrum allowed @xcite to consider all interactions at once , replacing the wave - induced forcing by an equivalent point source exerted on the sea surface .",
    "however , that latter approach is only valid for noise wavelengths much larger than those of the interacting oswg ."
