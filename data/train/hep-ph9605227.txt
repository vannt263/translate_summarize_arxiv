    "double - pomeron cross sections in hadron - hadron collisions were first calculated on the basis of single diffractive measurements and regge theory by chew and chew @xcite and by kaidalov and ter - martirosyan @xcite .",
    "using different models , these calculations have been continuously extended to partial cross section estimations ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the calculation of double - pomeron cross sections is subject to considerable uncertainty .",

    "\\(ii ) the double - pomeron cross section differs considerably , if this term is included into an unitarization procedure for all hadronic cross sections or not .",
    "for example , it was discussed recently @xcite , that the effects of shadowing decrease the double - pomeron cross sections at lhc energies by a factor of 5 .",
    "the cross section estimates as given for example in @xcite do not include any unitarization whereas in our approach the double - pomeron cross sections are included in the unitarization .",
    "\\(iii ) the energy dependence of the double - pomeron cross section might differ considerably when using either a critical or a supercritical pomeron intercept @xmath28 . in @xcite",
    "a critical pomeron intercept @xmath42 was used .",
    "here we use , consistent with high - energy cross section measurements , a supercritical intercept @xmath43 .",
    "\\(iv ) on a more practical level these cross sections depend on the cuts applied to the centrally produced cluster of particles and on the rapidity gaps demanded by the experimental triggers .",
    "\\(v ) in cd , one or both of the incoming hadrons can be excited to a resonance @xmath44 . in the following , for the comparison with the two - photon cross sections , we exclude from the calculation all cross section contributions involving resonances . including these contributions would about double the cross sections given below .",
    "these contributions would also change the rapidity gap demanded in experimental trigger conditions .    in the approximation of multiperipheral kinematics ,",
    "the mass @xmath45 of the centrally produced diffractive system is @xmath46 ( see fig .  [ cdiff ] ) .",
    "the rapidity gaps between the central system and the elastically scattered particles can be approximated by @xmath47 denoting the feynman @xmath23 of the elastically scattered particles @xmath20 and @xmath21 by @xmath48 and @xmath49 one gets @xcite @xmath50 and @xmath51    within the framework of gribov s reggeon calculus , the amplitude of the double - pomeron graph can be calculated ( for more details see @xcite ) . from this one gets the cross section as function of @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote the squared momentum transfer of particle @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) .",

    "the same three kinematical cuts are used : @xmath622gev / c@xmath63 and @xmath640.90 , 0.95 and 0.97 . in phojet",
    "we use a supercritical pomeron with @xmath65 = 0.08 whereas streng @xcite uses a critical pomeron with @xmath65 = 0 .",
    "note that the double - pomeron cross section grows in born approximation with @xmath66 like @xmath67 .",
    "this rapid increase is damped in phojet by the unitarization procedure . at high energies , contributions from multiple interactions",
    "become important .",
    "the demanded rapidity gaps are filled with hadrons due to inelastic rescattering and the cross section for cd gets strongly reduced .",
    "in contrast , streng calculates only the born term cross section .",
    "figure  [ sigdpoecm ] illustrates the differences obtained using different methods .",
    "we stress , both methods use the measured single diffractive cross sections to extract the triple - pomeron coupling .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that in a very recent work @xcite pomeron - pomeron cross sections have been studied in the perturbative bfkl - bartels approach ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the predictions on cross sections found in this work are of the same order as the ones obtained here .",
    "there are certain difficulties in resolving the cd cross section as a function of its central mass @xmath45 in hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "in fact , consider the simplest case of @xmath68 scattering with only two possible inelastic @xmath69 collisions .",
    "if in the first collision a central mass @xmath70 is produced , in the second collision another central mass @xmath71 is produced and their rapidities overlap , then it would not be possible to distinguish such an event from a single @xmath69 collision with the mass @xmath72 produced in the center",
    ". therefore hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions , rigorously speaking , only give information on the events with two fixed rapidity gaps , without specifying the exact nature of the object produced in between .",
    "however the situation improves if one takes into account that the cd events have a very small probability , so that the described event with two central masses produced is highly improbable .",
    "then the typical cd event will be that the central mass is produced in only one of the inelastic collisions , all others belonging to elastic or low mass diffractive events .",
    "in such a case the @xmath45-dependence of the cd cross section will evidently repeat that for @xmath0 collisions .",
    "an appropriate tool to calculate the cd cross section in hadron - nucleus and nucleus collisions is the so - called `` criterion @xmath73 '' @xcite .",
    "it has been known since long ago that in the glauber model the inelastic cross section is screened only by itself . as it turns out ,",
    "there are many other types of events which are screened by themselves .",
    "these events have to possess a certain property @xmath73 which satisfies the following requirement : any superposition of @xmath74 events , in which at least one has property @xmath73 , leads to the @xmath75 or @xmath76 event with property @xmath73 . as a consequence , the only possibility to obtain",
    "an @xmath75 or @xmath76 event without property @xmath73 should be that all @xmath74 events do not possess this property .    to translate the criterion @xmath73 into formulas ,",
    "let @xmath77 be the inelastic nucleus @xmath20-nucleus @xmath21 cross section considered as a function of the total nucleon - nucleon cross section @xmath78 .",
    "then the criterion @xmath73 tells that for the events with the property @xmath73 @xmath79 which exactly means that they are shadowed only by themselves .",
    "passing to cd events , we have to apply the criterion @xmath73 twice .",
    "first choose as events satisfying the criterion @xmath73 those with particles produced at least in one of the two fixed rapidity gaps which determine the central region .",
    "evidently any superposition of such @xmath74 events leads to an @xmath76 event of the same type .",
    "the complementary events are those in which no particle is produced in any of the two gaps . for @xmath74 collisions they include elastic events plus events in which particles are also produced in between the gaps and in the low mass diffractive regions of the projectile and target , above the upper gap and below the lower gap .",
    "therefore the nucleon - nucleon cross section @xmath80 will be given by the difference @xmath81 where @xmath82 refers to the mentioned low - mass diffractive contribution .",
    "@xmath83 denotes the central diffraction contribution ( to which also particles scattered elastically or low - mass diffraction contribute ) .",
    "note that the magnitude of the low - mass diffractive part depends on the choice of the experimental setup which defines the events satisfying the criterion @xmath73 .",
    "in particular , if these events are chosen to include all low - mass diffractive contribution to the @xmath74 cross section , then the term @xmath82 will not appear in ( [ m2 ] ) and the cross section @xmath83 will include only events with some particle produced in between the gap plus the projectile and target nucleons scattered elastically . in the following we shall be interested precisely in such cd events , having in mind that in the experimental setup for the photon - photon interaction small values of the momentum transferred to the colliding nuclei dominate , for which excitation of nucleon resonances is prohibited .",
    "for that reason we assume that all events with excitation of nucleon resonances are included in the events with the property @xmath73 .",
    "then ( [ m2 ] ) simplifies to @xmath84    subtracting from the total @xmath76 cross section the one with the described property @xmath73 we find a cross section which is a sum of the elastic cross section , the cross section for the diffractive dissociation of the colliding nuclei and the cd cross section in which the nuclei either stay intact or are diffractively dissociated @xmath85    now we repeat this argument taking for events satisfying @xmath73 those in which any particle is produced in the whole rapidity range spanned by the two gaps and the rapidity interval in between .",
    "such events also satisfy the conditions implied by the criterion @xmath73 .",
    "the complementary events are now those in which no particle is produced in the described rapidity range at all . for @xmath74 collisions these are pure elastic events .",
    "for @xmath76 they also include nuclei diffraction dissociation events .",
    "similar to ( [ m4 ] ) we then get the well known formula @xmath86    subtracting ( [ m5 ] ) from ( [ m4 ] ) we obtain the desired cd cross section for @xmath76 collisions @xmath87    this general formula can be written in an explicit form for @xmath75 collisions where the explicit dependence @xmath88 is known . in the glauber model , for fixed impact parameter @xmath21 , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the nuclear profile function .",
    "we then find the cd cross section @xmath91    from the derivation it is clear that this cross section refers to the total probability to produce some particles between the two gaps and does not specify the particles energy @xmath92 .",
    "however , as mentioned , we can make use of the fact that @xmath83 is very small .",
    "then one approximately finds from ( [ m8 ] ) @xmath93 this cross section is linear in @xmath83 .",
    "therefore we can easily find thep distribution in @xmath92 @xmath94 as we observe , the absorption factor is universal and does not depend on @xmath92 .",
    "the application of this formalism to nucleus - nucleus collisions is hampered by the absence of an explicit ( and tractable ) expression for @xmath77 .",
    "we shall use the well - known optical approximation in which @xmath77 is given by the same formula ( [ m7 ] ) with @xmath95 and an effective profile function for the two colliding nuclei @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the usual two dimensional impact parameter .",
    "our final formula for the cd cross section in @xmath98 collisions then follows from ( [ m10 ] ) @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the `` effective '' atomic number of the colliding nuclei defined by @xmath101    we compute @xmath100 using woods - saxon nuclear densities @xmath102 with the standard parameter values @xcite @xmath103 fm and @xmath104 fm and and @xmath105 mb , as predicted in @xcite for @xmath106 tev .",
    "the values of @xmath100 are given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "one observes that they are much smaller than @xmath107 .",
    "actually @xmath108 , so that even for very heavy colliding nuclei the cd cross section is only an order of magnitude greater than for proton - proton collisions .",
    "the derivation given above can be applied also to single diffraction with only one rapidity gap from the projectile or target side .",
    "one only has to appropriately change the events satisfying the criterion @xmath73 .",
    "then , instead of the central diffractive nucleon - nucleon cross section @xmath83 in eqs .",
    "( [ m2 ] )  ( [ m10 ] ) and ( [ m12 ] ) , the corresponding single diffractive cross sections @xmath109 will appear . in particular , the final result for the nucleus - nucleus single diffractive cross section will be @xmath110 for @xmath75 collisions we obtain instead of ( [ m8 ] ) and ( [ m9 ] ) @xmath111 and an analogous formula for @xmath112 similar to ( [ m10 ] ) .",
    "all of these formulae can be applied also for @xmath113 interactions in heavy ion collisions .",

    "the conclusion is obvious .",
    "central double - pomeron processes are best studied in @xmath0 collisions , where the largest luminosities are obtained , this compensates the rise of the double - pomeron cross section in heavy ion reactions . if photon - photon reactions are to be studied , then it should be the best to use the heaviest ions available at future colliders but even then the background from photon - pomeron collisions will be roughly of the same size as the signal .    * acknowledgements * + discussions with k.  eggert and s.  roesler are gratefully acknowledged .",
