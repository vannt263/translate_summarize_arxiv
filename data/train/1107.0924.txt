    "the limited supply of today s main energy sources , such as oil and coal , will force us to rely increasingly on renewable energy sources . besides wind and water power , energy conversion based on photovoltaic ( pv ) devices",
    "has received much attention as such a source .",
    "promising systems for next generation devices are organic photovoltaic solar cells ( opv ) because of their potential for low - cost processing .",
    "of particular interest are polymer - based heterojunctions consisting of a blend of electron - donor ( d ) and electron - acceptor ( a ) material ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "a prominent acceptor material is the buckminsterfullerene ( c@xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "the quest to improve the energy conversion efficiency of such systems is the focus of intensive current research .    to evaluate and subsequently improve the efficiency of organic photovoltaic cells it is crucial to understand the underlying energy conversion processes and how material properties affect their overall performance .",
    "widely accepted is the multistep generation process that starts with photon absorption by the donor ( often a polymer ) yielding an exciton ( bounded electron - hole pair ) .",
    "the generated exciton diffuses to the d - a interface , where it dissociates into free charge carriers , which are later transported to the electrodes .",
    "the d - a interface should be constructed to favor energetically fast and efficient electron transfer leading to exciton dissociation .",
    "the dynamics of electron transfer at the d - a interface is of crucial importance for the performance of heterojunction solar cells as measured by their efficiency . in considering this issue",
    ", one may address the thermodynamic efficiency @xmath1 @xcite by considering the solar cell as a heat engine operating between a hot and a cold reservoir with temperatures @xmath2 ( `` sun temperature '' , representing the incident radiation ) and @xmath3 ( temperature of the chemical environment ) , respectively .",
    "alternatively , the conversion efficiency @xmath4 @xcite associated with the maximum power point in the current - voltage characteristic is of interest as a realistic performance measure . establishing the relationship between system properties that affect exciton dissociation at the d - a interface and",
    "the cell efficiency is a major goal of the ongoing research . within this effort ,",
    "it is useful to consider simple model systems for which one can obtain explicit relationships between system structure and characteristic parameters and its performance measures . in this article",
    ", we describe and analyze such a model system .",
    "our model consists of coupled donor and acceptor molecules , each described as a two level ( highest occupied molecular level , homo , and lowest unoccupied molecular level , lumo ) system , situated between two electrodes . as such , it is an extension of a simpler model recently analyzed in a similar context by rutten et al . @xcite but with an important additional feature - the existence of an heterojunction characterized by energetic parameters - coulomb interaction and donor - acceptor lumo - lumo gap , that were identified as important driving factors in the operation of such systems .",
    "the system dynamics associated with this model is described by a kinetics scheme derived using a lattice gas approach , @xcite similar in spirit to previous work @xcite that uses a master equation approach to analyze cell dynamics .",
    "we show that an effective mechanism for both exciton pair formation and dissociation can be captured by a minimal model of this type , which can by used as a framework for discussing the current- and power - voltage curves and the cell efficiency .",
    "in particular , the model leads directly to the predictions of an optimal interface energy gap @xmath5 ( usually associated with the energy difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular levels ( lumo s ) of the d and a molecules ) for these efficiency measures .",
    "this can be compared with the performance of an ideal device , in which nonradiative losses are absent . in this ideal case ,",
    "the thermodynamic efficiency is found to decrease monotonously , whereas the power conversion efficiency still goes through a maximum , with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "( @xmath6 ) is denoted @xmath7.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]",
    "the pv cell model considered here is a one - dimensional lattice gas with two `` effective '' sites @xmath8 .",
    "one site represents the donor ( @xmath9 , e.  g. , polymer - based material ) and the second acts as acceptor ( @xmath10 , e.  g. , fullerene - based material ) .",
    "each of the sites is represented as a two - state system with energy levels ( @xmath11 ) and ( @xmath12 ) corresponding to the ( homo , lumo ) levels of the donor and acceptor species , respectively . in what follows we use the notation @xmath13 ( @xmath8 ) , for the energy differences that represent the donor and acceptor band gaps , and refer to @xmath14 as the interface or donor - acceptor lumo - lumo gap .",
    "the microstates of the system can be specified by the set of occupation numbers @xmath15 , where @xmath16 or @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ; @xmath19 ) if the corresponding level is vacant or occupied by an electron .    to assign further realistic contents to this model",
    ", we introduce the restrictions @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the first of these restrictions implies that the donor can be in the ground or excited state , or , following charge separation , in positively ionized state , but excludes its doubly occupied ( negatively charged ) state .",
    "the excited donor state @xmath22 represents the exciton formed as result of light absorption .",
    "the second condition implies that the acceptor can be in either its ground @xmath23 or its negative ion @xmath24 states .",
    "therefore , the system is characterized by six states with respect to the occupations @xmath25 , that we denote by the integers @xmath26 as shown in table  [ table : state ] .",
    ".system states and their occupations with corresponding energies .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     in the expressions for the states energies , @xmath27 is the coulombic repulsion between two electrons on the acceptor , whereas @xmath28 is the coulombic energy cost to move an electron away from the hole remaining on the donor . in general , we expect that @xmath29 .",
    "the sum @xmath30 can be thought of as the exciton binding energy in this model : it is the total coulomb energy cost for dissociating the exciton on the donor by moving an electron to the acceptor .",
    "it is convenient to redefine @xmath31 so that the energies @xmath32(@xmath33 ) are determined by the five energy parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .    at",
    "the left ( donor , say ) and right ( acceptor ) ends of the system , the device is connected with two electrodes represented by free electron reservoirs at chemical potentials @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "this is a highly simplified picture that disregards electron transport within the donor and acceptor phases .",
    "we have opted to make this simplification to focus on the important step of interfacial exciton dissociation , but future more realistic treatments should take these components of the overall dynamics into consideration . as sketched in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] , we use the common picture by which the left reservoir is assumed to exchange electrons only with the homo level of the donor , whereas the right lead exchange electrons with the upper level of the acceptor . direct electronic interaction between system and reservoirs",
    "is not explicitly taken into account , but it is implicit both in the states of molecular species adjacent to metal electrodes and in the kinetic charge transfer rates .",
    "next , we construct the kinetic scheme for the time evolution of the average occupations @xmath7 ( @xmath41 ) associated with this level structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) . in writing these equations , we make the simplifying assumption that electron exchange between molecules and metals involve only metal electrons at the electrochemical potentials @xmath42 and @xmath43 of the left and right leads ( corresponding to a bias potential @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the electron charge",
    ". we also disregard possible environmental relaxation dynamics due to polarization effects associated with the formation of transient charged molecular species .",
    "generalizing this dynamical picture to take such processes into account ( e.g. by considering time dependent site energies @xcite ) is another important subject for future work .",
    "the kinetics process in our scheme then corresponds to the following processes :    * electron transfer between levels @xmath46 and the left electrode and between @xmath47 and the right electrode , with rates determined by the corresponding molecular energies , molecules - leads coupling , electrochemical potentials in the leads , and the environmental temperature , @xmath3 . * electron transfer between donor and acceptor , determined by the coupling between them , the corresponding state energies , and the temperature , @xmath3 . *",

    "we will focus on the steady state magnitude , @xmath88 , of these currents .",
    "the time evolution and steady state currents associated with this kinetic model can be evaluated exactly , however such exact solution becomes costly for larger , more realistic system that takes into account also transport within the donor and acceptor phases .",
    "we therefore advance also an approximate mean field treatment and show that it can provide a good approximation to the exact analysis and can be used for realistic multilevel systems at a relatively low computational cost .    to this end",
    ", we introduce the averaged site occupations @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 ( see also the illustration in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] ) .",

    "finally , note that in the particular example employed here we have considered a situation where the imposed potential bias falls between the acceptor species and the right electrode .",
    "it should be emphasized that although the results shown in figs .",
    "3 and 4 are based on these choices , the qualitative behavior discussed below holds for a wide range of these parameters .",

    "figure [ fig : fig3]b compares the performance of a junction characterized by the prescribed parameters to the corresponding ideal junction in which nonradiative losses are absent ( @xmath105 ) . in both cases , the current is constant until the electrochemical potential on the right electrode comes within @xmath121 of the acceptor level a2 , and decreases sharply after it exceeds this level .",
    "consequently , the generated power , @xmath122 goes through a sharp maximum , @xmath123 in that voltage region .",
    "next , consider the efficiency .",
    "the maximal power conversion efficiency is defined by @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the incident radiant power , a constant independent of the process undergone by the system . the thermodynamic efficiency at maximum power is given by @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the net energy absorbed per unit time from the radiation field , that is , heat absorbed from the hot reservoir , @xmath128 .",
    "we note in passing that all processes undergone by our system are accompanied by well defined energy changes : the heat fluxes associated with the electron exchange processes between system and leads , are , in the present model @xmath129 and @xmath130 , @xmath131 is the net heat generation per unit time related to nonradiative relaxation processes , and @xmath132 is the heat flux associated with the electron transfer at the d - a interface .",
    "energy conservation implies that the overall cell power is the sum of these fluxes , i.  e. , @xmath133 .    of central importance",
    "is the dependence of the efficiency on the interface lumo - lumo energy gap @xmath5 .",
    "one may intuitively expect to find that an optimal value of this parameter exists : a finite @xmath5 is needed to drive the charge separation process but a larger @xmath5 implies that more energy may be lost to unproductive processes .",

    ", the mean field treatment provides a good approximation that closely follows the behavior of exact solutions .",
    "the influence of correlations is particularly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4]b , where we find small but noticeable differences between the mean field and the exact curves for @xmath5 beyond the maximum at @xmath135 .     and ( b ) thermodynamic efficiency @xmath1 evaluated at maximum power and displayed as functions of the interface gap @xmath5 .",
    "mean field results are compared with the exact solutions of the underlying master equation .",

    "in summary , the effort to increase and optimizing the efficiency of heterojunction opvs necessarily involve many structural and energetics system parameters .",
    "the above considerations focus on what is arguably the most important generic issue - the optimization of the interfacial lumo - lumo gap that compensate between the need to overcome the exciton binding energy and the required minimization of losses . for the present simplified model and our choice of parameters we find the most efficient setup for interface gap energies somewhat above @xmath142 .",
    "more important is the fact that the present model with future generalizations that should include transport in the donor and acceptor phases and polaronic relaxation following redistribution of charge densities provides a framework for analyzing such efficiency measures .",
    "the mean field approach introduced here provides a reliable approximation that can be used for fast evaluation of more complex model systems and will be useful in extending these studies to realistic opv cell models .",
    "a more ambitious task would be to generalize the concept advanced in the article to the quantum regime .",
