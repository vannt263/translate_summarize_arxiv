    "<S> we examine how large @xmath0- and @xmath1-violation effects are allowed in long baseline neutrino experiments with three generations of neutrinos , considering both the solar neutrino deficit and the atmospheric neutrino anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> we considerd two cases : when we attribute only the atmospheric neutrino anomaly to neutrino oscillation and assume the constant transition probability of @xmath2 to explain the solar neutrino deficit , we may have large @xmath0-violation effect . </S>",
    "<S> when we attribute both the atmospheric neutrino anomaly and the solar neutrino deficit to neutrino oscillation , we can see sizable @xmath1- violation effects . in this case , however , we can not ignore the matter effect and we will not see the pure @xmath0- violation effect . </S>",
    "<S> we also show simple methods how to separate pure @xmath0 violating effect from the matter effect . </S>",
    "<S> we give compact formulae for neutrino oscillation probabilities assuming one of the three neutrino masses ( presumably @xmath3 mass ) to be much larger than the other masses and the effective mass due to matter effect . </S>",
    "<S> two methods are shown : one is to observe envelopes of the curves of oscillation probabilities as functions of neutrino energy ; a merit of this method is that only a single detector is enough to determine the presence of @xmath0 violation . </S>",
    "<S> the other is to compare experiments with at least two different baseline lengths ; this has a merit that it needs only narrow energy range of oscillation data .    </S>",
