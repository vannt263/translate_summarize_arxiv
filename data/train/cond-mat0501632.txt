    "sand dunes develop wherever sand is exposed to a medium which lifts grains from the ground and entrains them into _ saltating _ flow , where grains impacting onto the sand bed eject more and more sand until saturation of the wind is reached leading to a _",
    "stationary _ flux .",
    "the diverse conditions of wind and sand supply in different regions give rise to a large variety of dune shapes .",
    "after the pioneering work by bagnold @xcite , dune morphology and dynamics have been investigated many times by geologists and geographers  @xcite . for nearly four decades , they have mainly reported field observations about the conditions under which the different kinds of dunes appear as well as measured their velocity , their shape , the patterns they form , the size distribution of sand grains , and many other properties . however",
    ", describing the formation and evolution of a dune field requires knowledge of parameters related to the geological history of the area , which is in almost all cases not easy to determine .",
    "strong variations in sand supply , climate , wind behavior , and characteristics of the soil over periods of thousands of years are decisive for the actual pattern of the dune fields observed .",
    "almost half of all terrestrial sand seas are covered with transverse dunes @xcite .",
    "these dunes appear when unidirectional winds act on areas covered with sand , leading to instabilities of the sand bed @xcite , or for instance when barchan dunes touch at their horns forming barchanoids @xcite and , for increasing amount of sand , giving rise to almost continuous linear chains propagating in the wind direction @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] we show the sketch of a barchan dune ( top ) and an image of the dune field `` lenis maranhenses '' ( northeastern brazil ) , at its very beginning region , ilustrating a typical situation where an increasing amount of sand yields the transition barchanoids @xmath0 transverse dunes ( bottom ) .",
    "the mechanisms responsible for transverse dune formation have been extensively investigated by physicists and mathematicians from a theoretical point of view @xcite .",
    "it has been verified through simulations using a numerical model in three dimensions that an open system of transverse dunes seems to approach lateral translational invariance under unidirectional winds @xcite , allowing modelling transverse dunes in two dimensions . in spite of the great theoretical advances , many questions concerning the physics of these dunes",
    "remain open , mainly those related to dune interactions in a field and the difficulty in simulating such systems @xmath1 real transverse dune fields may reach lengths of hundreds of kilometers .",
    "a simple model to study transverse dune fields has been recently introduced  @xcite .",
    "this model is defined in terms of the dune height only , from which sand transport , dune velocity and the field evolution are determined through a set of three phenomenological equations .",
    "the initial conditions consisted of a field of dunes with different heights and spacing , and the model reproduced the observation that in many fields all transverse dunes have similar heights . in the present work ,",
    "we study a different scenario , in which the model is used to describe the _ formation _ of a dune field .",
    "such scenarios can be found for instance in coastal areas , where the sand is transported by the wind from the sea into the continent , after being deposited by ocean tides on the beach ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) .        furthermore , we take into account data of recently performed field measurements for the aspect ratio of dunes and for inter - dune distances @xcite , which are related to the recirculating flow at the lee side ( side of the slip face , where avalanches occur ) of the dunes and to the saturation length of the saltating grains @xcite .",
    "recently , besler  @xcite proposed that dunes may present solitary wave behavior , an effect which has been investigated in simulations with three - dimensional barchans  @xcite , and with transverse dunes in two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "we define dune interaction according to coalescence and solitary wave behavior , where we use relations found for interactions of barchan dunes @xcite , since it has been shown that the central transverse profile of symmetric barchans may be a good approximation for the height profile of transverse dunes @xcite .",
    "our results show that the evolution of dune fields depends strongly on the presence of a sand bed in the field .",
    "if there is no sand between dunes , the dune field presents small dunes at its end , which wander with high velocity and increase continuously the size of the field .",
    "on the other hand , if the dune field evolves on a sand sheet over which the sand flux is saturated , the smaller dunes do not wander away , and a regular dune spacing is obtained . in this case",
    ", we find that the time evolution of the dune spacing in the field agrees well with the results obtained by werner and kocurek @xcite using a two - dimensional model based on defect dynamics in transverse bedforms . the number of dunes in the field as a function of time is also studied and found to decrease quite regularly in time due to coalescence of dunes .",
    "finally , we use our model to simulate coastal dune fields assuming a constant sand influx downwind .    the model details are presented in the next section . in section 3 our results",
    "are presented and discussed .",
    "conclusions are made in section 4 .",
    "in our model , the variable which determines the field dynamics is the dune height .",
    "transverse dunes move in the @xmath2 ( wind ) direction with a velocity @xmath3 inversely proportional to the height @xmath4 at their crest : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a phenomenological constant which contains information about wind speed , grain size , etc .",
    "@xcite . a geometrical description of the main elements of our model is shown in fig .  [ fig : triangles ] , where two dunes of heights @xmath4 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , have their profiles represented by triangles .",
    "the dune width @xmath9 is related to its height @xmath4 as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are constants determined , respectively , by measurements of the height profile at the windward side of transverse dunes in the field @xcite and by the fact that the slip face defines an angle of approximately @xmath13 with the horizontal @xcite .",
    "the region of recirculating flow at the lee side of the dune , also called `` separation bubble '' , has been found to extend downwind from the brink ( which in our model coincides with the crest ) up to a distance of the order of @xmath14 times the dune height @xcite . here , we use a separation bubble of length @xmath15 , thus the quantity @xmath16 in fig .",
    "[ fig : triangles ] has length @xmath17 for all dunes .",
    "the separation bubble of the dunes has an important implication in interactions of closely spaced dunes , since the net sand flux inside the bubble is zero @xcite .",
    "the distance measured from the reattachment point of the separation bubble of dune @xmath18 to the foot of the windward side of the next dune downwind , @xmath19 , is called here @xmath20 .",
    "dune interaction is defined for the case in which a small dune moving in wind direction behind a larger one eventually reaches , due to its higher velocity , the position of the larger one . in our model , this event is assumed to occur whenever the separation bubble of dune @xmath18 `` touches '' the windward side of the downwind dune @xmath19 , or in other words , when @xmath21 in fig .",
    "[ fig : triangles ] .",
    "it has been found from 3d simulations using a saltation model that barchan dunes may behave as solitary waves @xcite , if their sizes are not too different .",
    "the idea is that the interacting dunes exchange sand , the dune downwind decreases in size giving sand to the smaller dune upwind , and they essentially interchange their roles , like if the smaller dune would cross the larger one .",
    "however , if the faster dune is significantly smaller than the higher dune downwind , coalescence occurs : the small dune bumps into the larger one and gets `` swallowed up '' @xcite . in our model ,",
    "dune interaction is defined according to the parameter @xmath22 : if the ratio of the dune volumes @xmath23 is smaller than @xmath22 , then the dunes coalesce , and the final dune has height @xmath24 @xcite ; the number of dunes in the field decreases by unity whenever two dunes coalesce . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath25 , then solitary wave behavior occurs : dunes interchange their roles and the relation between their initial and final heights is as follows @xcite :    @xmath26    obeying the following mass conservation equation : @xmath27 equation ( [ eq : h2/h2 ] ) is a simplified approximation of the phenomenological observation reported by duran et .",

    "although this has been obtained for barchans , we apply the approach ( [ eq : h2/h2 ] ) to transverse dunes since careful analysis of 3d simulation results for the shear stress on barchan dunes have shown that the central cut of these dunes may be a good description for the height profile of transverse dunes @xcite .",
    "while in reference @xcite the value of @xmath22 that fits the observations for barchans is around @xmath29 , in the present work we consider @xmath22 as a model parameter to study interaction of transverse dunes in the field .",
    "the value of the constant @xmath30 in eq .",

    "we thus identify two limit cases of the parameter @xmath22 : when @xmath33 , no coalescence occurs , and the number of dunes in the field remains constant , while for @xmath34 every collision of two dunes results in coalescence and the consequent decrease in the number of dunes in the field .",
    "the relations ( [ eq : h2/h2 ] ) and ( [ eq : mass_conservation ] ) are two _ independent _ equations that are used to determine the final dune heights after each iteration in which dunes interact like solitary waves .    as mentioned before , the initial condition in all simulations consists of an empty field ( i.e. without any dune ) . afterwards",
    ", transverse dunes with random heights of values uniformly distributed between @xmath35 and @xmath36 are injected into the field at a constant rate @xmath37 from the origin @xmath38 downwind , moving with velocity @xmath39 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : velocity ] ) .",
    "the time interval @xmath40 may vary between 1 and 100 time steps .",
    "typical values of dune heights in the beginning of a dune field are observed to be around @xmath41 m .",
    "thus , to study formation of transverse dune fields , @xmath36 will be set close to @xmath42 m .",
    "however , in cases ( i ) and ( ii ) we will use larger values for @xmath36 , thus providing a wider spectrum of dune heights in order to study the effect of coalescence and solitary wave behavior in the evolution of a dune field . in our simulations ,",
    "each time step is defined as @xmath43 year .",
    "thus , after each iteration dunes move a distance downwind given by @xmath44 m , and may interact with each other according to the rules mentioned before .",
    "the typical simulation time for 10000 iterations is a few tens of seconds running on a pentium iv .",
    "following the dynamics described above , we study three cases : ( i ) dunes are injected into a field with no sand on the ground ; ( ii ) dune fields are studied when the ground is covered with a sand bed , where a phenomenological parameter , the saturation length of the saltation sheet , is introduced .",
    "( iii ) finally , we add to case ( ii ) a differential equation to simulate a sand influx , which changes the heights of the dunes over the field evolution .",
    "in cases ( i ) and ( ii ) we investigate the evolution of the field due only to interactions of dunes through coalescence and solitary wave behavior , according to relations ( [ eq : h2/h2 ] ) and ( [ eq : mass_conservation ] ) , which are the mechanisms leading to changes in the heights of the dunes . in this case",

    "notice that @xmath50 m is a value quite unrealistic to study the origin of a dune field where dunes are injected from the beach .",
    "however , as mentioned above , we are in this first part of our work only interested in studying the effect of interactions between dunes during the field evolution .",
    "figure [ fig : field_without_ls ] shows that the initial number of dunes has been reduced by coalescence .",
    "furthermore , we can see that the height of the dunes in the field decreases as the inverse of the dune position downwind : the smaller dunes are found at the end of the field .",
    "the dashed line in the main plot represents the curve @xmath54 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath55 of the curve @xmath56 is time dependent , and may be determined from eq .",
    "( [ eq : velocity ] ) , which leads to @xmath57 .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that small dunes bump into larger ones giving rise to the large height profile at the beginning of the field , while dunes interacting like solitary waves contribute to the emergence of the small dune heights observed at larger values of @xmath2 , and the consequent temporal increase of the field length , i.e. the distance between the dunes at both extremities of the field .",
    "we have also observed that the curve @xmath58 is independent of the value of @xmath22 .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : field_without_ls ] shows that the mean spacing @xmath59 between the dunes increases indefinitely with time , since the small dunes at the end of the field , due to their higher velocities , get more and more apart from the larger ones .",
    "notice that the average dune spacing @xmath59 for one particular realization of transverse dune field may be written as a linear function of the time @xmath60 with coefficient in terms of the heights of the first and last dunes , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively , as well as of the total number of dunes in the field , @xmath63 : @xmath64 for the dune field shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : field_without_ls ] , we have @xmath65 , @xmath66 m and @xmath67 m , then we find that the coefficient of eq .",
    "( [ eq : spacing ] ) is approximately @xmath68 , which agrees with the slope of the curve shown in the inset of this figure .    in summary ,",
    "our findings for case ( i ) show transverse dune fields with decreasing dune heights with distance and an increasing dune spacing with time , since the smaller faster dunes wander at the end of the field .",
    "however , field measurements @xcite have shown that dune spacing _ increases _ with the dune height , as opposed to the situation found in fig .",
    "[ fig : field_without_ls ] , where spacing between smaller dunes is mostly larger than for higher dunes .",
    "furthermore , one relevant aspect to be noticed in the dune field of fig .",
    "[ fig : field_without_ls ] is the quite irregular dune spacing , where `` clusters '' of dunes are even observed , which are not found in real transverse dune fields .",
    "an important difference between transverse dune fields observed on terrestrial sand seas and the dune fields simulated so far using our model lies in the availability of sand on the ground . in dune fields where transverse dunes appear on a sand sheet over which the sand flux between the dunes",
    "is saturated , regular spacing and similar dune heights are observed  @xcite .",
    "this happens because the availability of sand yields a saturated flux between dunes .",
    "saturation is reached within a time interval of a few seconds , and is associated with the saturation length @xmath69 , which is found to decrease with the strength of the wind @xcite . in a transverse dune field developed on a sand bed , this length may be measured from the reattachment point of the separation bubble of the upwind dune ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : triangles ] ) , where the wind strength increases from zero ( value of the wind strength in the separation bubble ) and sand transport initiates @xcite .",
    "when the flux becomes saturated , i.e. after a distance @xmath70 from the reattachment point , sand is deposited at the foot of the windward side where the wind strength decreases , and the surface at the beginning of the downwind dune is not eroded .",
    "it follows that no dune can move faster than its upwind neighbor .    to simulate such dune fields , we introduce in our model the phenomenological constant @xmath69 by fixing for the quantity @xmath20 in fig .",
    "[ fig : triangles ] a maximum value @xmath71 .",
    "we set @xmath72 m. as a consequence , the _ maximum _ crest - to - crest distance in the field , @xmath73 , is calculated as : @xmath74 according to the definitions in fig .",
    "[ fig : triangles ] .",
    "it is important to notice that the maximum spacing @xmath73 in the field , as predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dcc ] ) , is not a constant , but does depend on the dune size , and is larger in dune fields of higher dunes .",
    "figure [ fig : field_with_ls ] shows two simulated dune fields when the saturation length @xmath69 is taken into account ( case ( ii ) ) .",
    "the profile shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : field_with_ls](a ) corresponds to @xmath75 years , where dunes of initial heights between @xmath42 m and @xmath76 m have been injected into the field ( now a ground covered with sand ) using @xmath77 year , @xmath78 m@xmath49year and @xmath79 .",
    "as we can see in this figure , all transverse dunes reach approximately the same height , around @xmath80 m , and present a quite regular spacing . figure  [ fig : field_with_ls](b ) shows another dune field obtained at @xmath81 years with @xmath42 m and @xmath50 m , @xmath77 year , @xmath78 m@xmath49year and @xmath79 , where we find dunes regularly spaced and of heights around 8 m . as we can see , the value of the final dune height depends on the initial values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig : field_with_ls ] with fig .",

    "we introduced a phenomenological parameter , @xmath22 , which was compared to the ratio @xmath120 of the volumes of the interacting dunes of heights @xmath4 and @xmath7 , @xmath121 , where coalescence and solitary wave behavior were defined respectively for @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "we found that this simple rule led to a strong dependence of the field evolution on @xmath22 .",
    "we have shown that dune fields formed by input of dunes onto an empty field with no sand on the ground present decreasing dune heights and increasing spacing with the distance downwind , and the length of the field increases indefinitely with time .",
    "on the other hand , we found that the dune height and spacing reach an equilibrium value if the saturation length @xmath69 of the saltation sheet is considered , where we simulated transverse dune fields evolving on a sand bed .",
    "however , the final dune heights were limited due to the absence of a sand influx . by introducing a sand influx ,",
    "we could simulate coastal dune fields with crescent dune heights with distance .",
    "we have shown that , in spite of the simplicity of the model , our results agree with predictions of simulations from more complex dune models in two dimensions and reproduce well real transverse dune fields .",
