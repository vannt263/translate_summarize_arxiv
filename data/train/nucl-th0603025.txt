    "to view the light hadronic systems as few - body systems involves several problematic aspects , and many of these aspects still need to be theoretically explored in detail .",
    "not all cases are so fortunate that one can accurately reduce the underlying field - theoretical problem to a non - relativistic quantum - mechanical hamiltonian formulation in a ( two - body , three - body , etc . )",
    "potential scheme .",
    "one fortunate situation occurs typically in low - energy few - nucleon physics  @xcite , where the considered degrees of freedom are the nucleons , and the non - relativistic interactions are generated via meson - exchange processes , or via alternative , effective field - theoretical derivations .",
    "but , even in this well - defined research area , there have been attempts to brake the paradigm of the purely nucleonic hamiltonian description in the potential scheme  @xcite , and to relate the origin of well - known unsolved problems , such as the @xmath8 puzzle , to dynamical effects of the pion  @xcite .    as the energy increases ,",
    "the light hadronic systems become much more problematic to be described .",
    "the opening of the pionic threshold forces to deal directly with the pion degrees of freedom .",
    "this complicates the few - body equations since one has to deal simultaneously with phenomena of production and absorption of particles  @xcite .",
    "the derivation of non - perturbative dynamical equations for meson - few - nucleon processes is still waiting for a consistent theory that solves the general problem in a feasible and calculable way .",
    "specific topics , such as the study of @xmath9 inelasticities , both in free space and in more complex nuclear environments , have received much attention recently .",
    "many phenomenological works have attempted the description of the experimental data , including polarization data , and extensive reviews on the past and current status of research on this subject are available@xcite . in general ,",
    "such models perform some nonrelativistic reduction of the interaction hamiltonian between mesons and nucleons , and construct the basic production mechanisms using perturbative schemes . typically , these terms consist of the @xmath10nn one - body term ( direct term plus recoil ) and some more complex two - nucleon processes such as pion rescattering , intermediate @xmath11 excitations , and 2n processes involving heavy - meson exchange currents . as yet , there is not a clear - cut understanding of which mechanisms contribute the most and , especially in the isoscalar channel at threshold ( the channel of the pp@xmath12pp@xmath13 process ) there has been quite a debate on which are the basic mechanisms that provide the strength to the threshold cross section . this strength can be generated either by short - range heavy - meson exchanges  @xcite , or by pion rescatterings in the @xmath14 channel  @xcite .",
    "presently , the analysis of the @xmath9 inelasticities did not succeed to resolve this ambiguity , and there is hope that the study of more complex reactions , such as @xmath15 , can help to solve this ambiguity .",
    "phenomenological studies for this reaction have been limited to calculations involving only pion rescattering in the @xmath14-channel  @xcite ; these calculations achieved , very recently , a good reproduction of data for both angular distributions for the excitation function and for the analyzing power  @xcite . for this 3n reaction ,",
    "a thorough study involving production mechanisms originated also by 2n heavy - meson exchanges is needed , but unfortunately these studies have still to come .",
    "besides the problem of constructing the 2n heavy - meson exchange mechanisms in a consistent manner ( we will come back to this problem in the final part of this paper ) , there remain , in addition , several difficulties that need to be explored .",
    "one is related to the need to use relativistic equations for the nucleon dynamics in the energy range of meson production , since this energy range is higher than the typical low - energy nuclear regime where nonrelativistic quantum mechanics works so well .",
    "then , the first step is to construct consistent relativistic ( pseudo ) potentials that fulfill the poincar algebra .",
    "another difficulty is connected with the treatment of virtual effects generated by the @xmath16nn vertex in the production process . to directly use the",
    "one - body vertex and similar operators in the construction of one - body - type production mechanisms may create serious difficulties because in the @xmath17 vertex the three particles can not stay simultaneously on - mass - shell .",
    "however , the use of quantum - mechanical equations for the nucleon dynamics forces the nucleons on their mass shell , and the pion , being the physical observed particle in the production process , has also to stay on its mass shell .",
    "clearly , all this creates ambiguities in the possible treatment of one - body operators , and hence there are problems of internal inconsistencies in the construction and calculation of sets of one - body , two - body , etc , operators .",
    "this represents a not negligible problem in pion production at threshold : although the magnitude of the one - body term is generally small , the interference effects of the one - body term with respect to the more dominant two - body amplitudes have important consequences in the cross sections .",
    "a similar difficulty also occurs when the elementary fermion - meson vertex interaction is used for the construction of meson decays operators in relativistic constituent quark models .",
    "it has been shown recently that the use of the spectator - model ansatz ( built upon the elementary quark - meson vertex ) in relativistic quantum mechanics ( rqm ) is not fully constrained in covariant calculations of strong ( meson ) decays of baryon resonances .",
    "this aspect has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite specifically for the construction of spectator - model operators in the so - called point - form formulation of rqm .",
    "however , the presence of ambiguities in the general construction of current operators has been observed in all forms of rqm , including front form and instant form  @xcite .",
    "the approach illustrated in this paper represents a field - theoretic way to overcome the above mentioned difficulties . among the varieties of field - theoretical approaches we concentrate on the unitary - transformation ( ut ) methods for hamiltonian - based models .",
    "ut s do not change the expressions for the observables , because the @xmath18-matrix remains the same under such transformations .",
    "however , the unitary transformations allow to change the representation of the hamiltonian so that the interaction operators refers to particles with physical ( observable ) properties .",
    "it is important that the interactions extracted this way are hermitian , energy - independent and include the off - shell structures naturally .",
    "these attractive features of the unitary transformation approaches allow to derive pion - production interaction operators that are relativistic and involve only physical particles ( and hence , one - body operators are eliminated from the representation and all the virtual processes or effects are embedded in the interaction operators ) ; we also extend the calculation to include 2n heavy - meson exchange mechanisms for the production amplitude , given the importance that these mechanisms have in discussing the phenomenology of 3n forces and pion production .",
    "there have been quite different implementations of ut techniques ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein , for a review ) . in such approaches",
    "one starts with the original field hamiltonian @xmath19 , to arrive at a new representation of @xmath19 which is unitarily equivalent and where the particles involved interact through interaction operators that are energy independent .",
    "such energy independence simplifies the solution of the eigenvalue problem for the initial hamiltonian . to avoid the confusion that already exists in the literature ,",
    "we do not employ here the inflated term `` effective '' to qualify our interactions , since they have no direct connections ( that we are aware of ) with the formalisms of effective lagrangians .    amongst the different ut formalisms , we mention first okubo s idea @xcite to block - diagonalize @xmath19 via a ut with respect to the decomposition of the full fock space @xmath20 of hadronic states into the nucleon ( no - meson ) subspace and its complement in @xmath21 .",
    "the okubo approach was further developed by glckle and mller @xcite in their relativistic theory of interacting particles .",
    "these authors were the first to show , al least to our knowledge , how with the help of one single ut the non - commuting hermitian operators ( hamiltonian and lorentz boosts ) can be reduced to a block form .",
    "for a simple model of  spinless nucleons  exchanging scalar mesons , it was then possible to construct the new hermitian and energy independent contributions to the poincar group generators .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the same method was employed for deriving the nucleon - nucleon and nucleon - antinucleon interactions starting from a field hamiltonian with the exchange of @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath22 mesons .",
    "then , in the framework of the hartree approximation , these interactions have been introduced to describe the saturation properties of nuclear matter . that approximation , we note in passing , gives rise to an original recipe ( see eqs .",
    "( 23)-(25 ) in @xcite ) for calculating the nucleon mass shift in the three dimensional approach .",
    "fuda and co - workers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite have also used the okubo - glckle - mller approach to construct one - boson - exchange models in light - front dynamics .",
    "they prefer to work with the mass - square operator @xmath23 rather than with @xmath19 because the former commutes with all of the poincar generators . such studies demonstrated that the two - particle interactions obtained in second - order perturbation theory have certain similarities but do not coincide exactly with the relevant born terms obtained using the feynman - diagram techniques ( see also ref .",
    "we shall address this question in more detail in sec .",
    "successful applications of the ut method have been obtained also in the theory of nuclear forces and nuclear electromagnetic processes ( see refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite with reference to earlier studies of the 50 s , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "such developments by the osaka group  @xcite illustrate another useful application of the ut formalism : the elimination from @xmath19 of certain virtual processes whose @xmath18-matrix elements , by definition , have to vanish on the energy shell .",
    "remarkably , the transformed hamiltonian @xmath24 contains only interactions for real processes . even more remarkably , it was possible to derive the one - pion - exchange ( ope ) and two - pion - exchange ( tpe ) nucleon - nucleon potentials , the pion - nucleon potential ( see also @xcite ) , the @xmath25 transition potential , the interactions for pion absorption / production , and so on , from one and the same initial hamiltonian @xmath26 without any additional _ ad hoc _ assumption ( of physical or mathematical nature ) in each case .",
    "the corresponding hermitian energy - independent operators are defined in the complete @xmath20 , _",
    "i.e. _ , not only in a subspace @xmath27 as was the case for okubo approach .    in the present work ,",
    "we construct the meson - baryon interaction operators relying upon the notion of  clothed  particles .",
    "such notion was introduced many years ago by greenberg and schweber  @xcite ( see also chapter xii in the monograph  @xcite ) in their aim to include the so - called cloud or persistent effects ( the terminology refers back to van hove @xcite , @xcite ) . in this connection , we apply the method of unitary clothing transformations elaborated by @xcite and @xcite and developed recently in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this way ,",
    "a large amount of virtual processes induced by the meson absorption / emission , the @xmath28 -pair annihilation / production and other cloud effects can be accumulated in the creation ( destruction ) operators for the clothed ( physical ) mesons and nucleons .",
    "such a bootstrap reflects the most significant distinction between the concepts of clothed and bare particles .",
    "the approach used in this article differs from the aforementioned ones at least in two aspects .",
    "first , the clothing procedure does not aim , _ a priori _ , to define a ut that blockdiagonalizes @xmath19 , as is done in the okubo approach .",
    "besides , it might be not always possible to implement such a task in the infinite - dimensional hilbert space . instead , the aim of the multistep clothing procedure is to express the original hamiltonian @xmath19 in terms of the new clothed - particle operators in a form which is different than that given for the initial bare - particle ones .",
    "such a transition from the bare - particle representation ( bpr ) to the clothed - particle representation ( cpr ) introduces a new sparse structure of the original hamiltonian @xmath19 .",
    "second , in the framework of the cpr the mass and vertex renormalization problem  @xcite ,  @xcite is considered in a natural way , in parallel with the construction of the interactions , while the renormalization problem in ref .",
    "@xcite has been disregarded .",
    "other distinctions are discussed in sects . 2 and 3 .",
    "in this context , we would like to draw attention to the recent work by stefanovich on the problem of divergences in qft . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can introduce a similarity transformation @xmath29 to cancel infinite counterterms directly in @xmath19 and therefore also in the @xmath18-matrix operator . as an application ,",
    "the method has been illustrated for the case of an hamiltonian system in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "although ref .",
    "@xcite does not use the clothing ideas , there are many points of contact between that approach and the cpr method and , in our opinion , further developments in this area could have promising perspectives .",
    "the central goal of this paper is the derivation of interaction operators in the cpr for the processes @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . for the field - theoretical treatment of mesons and nucleons",
    "we assume the instant form after dirac of relativistic dynamics , in which the generators of space translations and rotations are the same as in the free theory .",
    "we remind that in this case the three boost operators must involve the interaction parts to meet , together with the total hamiltonian @xmath30 , the well - known commutation relations of the poincar - lie algebra . at the beginning we prefer to consider @xmath19 as a function of creation and destruction operators in the fock space rather than the more customary form that follows from a given field lagrangian .",
    "our option follows a general statement that @xmath19 may be expressed as a sum of products of creation and destruction operators ( see chapter iii of ref .",
    "this hamilton formulation of rqft simplifies the introduction of the cpr that we consider in this work .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "the aspects of the method of unitary clothing transformations , which are necessary for constructing a new family of interactions operators in the meson - two - nucleon system are illustrated in sec .",
    "we introduce an auxiliary ut s that convert the primary bare bosons and fermions into some intermediate - level particles with physical masses .",
    "the approach develops along the chain : bare particles with bare masses @xmath31 bare particles with physical masses @xmath31 physical ( observable ) particles .",
    "this procedure is useful for drawing some parallels between the clothing approach in qft and the method of canonical transformations ( in particular , the bogoliubov ones ) in the theory of superfluidity and superconductivity .",
    "analytical expressions for the relativistic interactions ( quasipotentials ) in the cpr are shown in sec . 3 in case of the primary yukawa coupling between pions and nucleons .",
    "our calculations are performed using purely algebraic means within an iterative technique proposed in that section .",
    "the features that distinguish the obtained momentum - space quasipotentials from their on - energy - shell counterparts derived in the second - order dyson perturbation theory with feynman rules are emphasized .",
    "explicit formulae for the quasipotentials generated by the additional heavier - meson exchange mechanisms are given in sec .",
    "our departure point is the hamiltonian @xmath32 where the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath33 and the interaction term @xmath34 depend on the creation and destruction operators of the `` bare '' particles with unphysical masses and coupling constants . here",
