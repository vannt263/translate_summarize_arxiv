    "exclusive electroproduction of vector mesons ( vms ) is a particularly good process for studying the transition from the soft to the hard regime of strong interactions  @xcite , the former being well described within the regge phenomenology while the latter - by perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "the interest in this interplay comes from the need to understand at which scale a partonic language is applicable .",
    "the exclusive electroproduction of vms can then be used to extract information about the generalized parton distributions ( gpds )  @xcite , an essential addition to understanding the partonic wave - function of the proton .    among the most striking expectations  @xcite in this transition",
    "is the change of the logarithmic derivative @xmath0 of the cross section @xmath1 with respect to the @xmath2 center - of - mass energy @xmath3 , from a value of about 0.2 in the soft regime to 0.8 in the hard one , and the decrease of the exponential slope @xmath4 of the differential cross section with respect to the squared - four - momentum transfer @xmath5 , from a value of about 10 gev@xmath6 to an asymptotic value of about 5 gev@xmath6 when the virtuality @xmath7 of the photon increases .",
    "the soft to hard transition can be seen by studying the @xmath3 dependence of the cross section for exclusive vector meson photoproduction , from the lightest one , @xmath8 , to the heavier ones , up to the @xmath9 .",
    "the scale in this case is set by the mass of the vector meson , as in photoproduction @xmath7 = 0 .",

    "the data at high @xmath3 can be parameterised as @xmath14 , and the value of @xmath0 is displayed in the figure for each reaction .",
    "one sees clearly the transition from a shallow @xmath3 dependence for low scales to a steeper one as the scale increases .",
    "one can also check this transition by varying @xmath7 for a given vector meson . the cross section @xmath15 is presented in fig .",

    "the results are plotted as a function of @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the mass of the vector meson .",
    "one sees an approximate universal behaviour , showing an increase of @xmath0 as the scale becomes larger , in agreement with the expectations mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the value of @xmath0 at low scale is the one expected from the soft pomeron intercept  @xcite , while the one at large scale is in accordance with twice the logarithmic derivative of the gluon density with respect to @xmath3 .     from a fit of the form @xmath22 for exclusive vector - meson electroproduction , as a function of @xmath20 .",

    "[ fig : b09 ] .",
    "as expected , @xmath4 decreases to a universal value of about 5 gev@xmath6 as the scale increases .",
    "figures  [ fig : del09 ] and  [ fig : b09 ] might give the impression that the variable @xmath20 can serve as an effective scale for vector mesons .",
    "in the following we will show that this is not the case and that further study is needed to determine this scale .",
    "one way to study this question is to look at the @xmath3 dependence of the cross section ratio @xmath24 of exclusive vector meson electroproduction to that of the total @xmath2 one , @xmath25 .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that using pqcd arguments this ratio should have , at fixed @xmath7 , a @xmath3 dependence of the form @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the parameter describing the increase of the proton structure function @xmath28 with decreasing @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "using regge arguments , one obtains that @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the intercept of the pomeron trajectory .",
    "since @xmath33 , both approaches predict the same @xmath24 behaviour .",
    "the variable @xmath4 is the exponential slope of the differential cross section . both in pqcd and regge",
    "approaches the ratio @xmath24 rises with @xmath3 .",

    "the shaded band shows @xmath32 - 1 as obtained from hadron - hadron total cross section data . ]    when calculating the ratio @xmath24 one has to ensure that both cross sections are taken at the same hard scale , which we denote as @xmath35 .",
    "clearly , for the total inclusive cross section , the effective scale is @xmath7 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lam - hera ] one can see the @xmath7 dependence of @xmath27 resulting from fitting the @xmath28 data in the low-@xmath29 region ( @xmath36 ) to the form @xmath37 . for photoproduction and the low @xmath7 region , the value of @xmath27 is in good agreement with that expected from the pomeron intercept ( @xmath38 .",
    "starting at about @xmath391 gev@xmath40 , the value of @xmath27 rises logarithmically with @xmath7 .",
    "it is of interest to see if @xmath24 shows the expected @xmath41 behaviour .",
    "it is not clear what is the effective scale for exclusive vector meson electroproduction .",
    "one suggested scale , originally for the @xmath18  @xcite , is @xmath42 .",
    "frankfurt , koepf and strikman  @xcite calculated the effective scale for @xmath43 and @xmath9 , and find that their effective scale for the @xmath18 and for the @xmath9 are significantly larger than that suggested by  @xcite .",
    "one can parameterise  @xcite their effective scale for the @xmath8 as @xmath44 .",
    "as the most precise data at present are those of the exclusive electroproduction of @xmath8  @xcite , we will use these data to investigate the question of the effective scale .",
    "the ratio @xmath45 as a function of @xmath3 , for different fixed effective scales , seems to be constant with @xmath3 and shows a possible @xmath3 dependence only at the highest scale .",
    "we have shown earlier that this ratio is expected to grow with @xmath3 like @xmath41 in both the pqcd and the regge approaches .",
    "this would thus indicate that the @xmath27 values obtained from this ratio are inconsistent with those obtained in the inclusive total deep inelastic cross section case .",
    "we can in fact compare directly the values of @xmath0 obtained from the @xmath3 dependence of the @xmath8 cross section , shown in fig .",

    "the effective scale of @xmath8 was chosen so that the two @xmath27 agree . ]",
    "the @xmath27 values obtained from the @xmath3 dependence of the @xmath8 are lower than those of the inclusive one for all but the highest effective scale of the @xmath8 .",
    "this is true also for @xmath48 as well as for the effective scale suggested in  @xcite .",
    "one way to find experimentally the right effective scale is to force the @xmath27 from the @xmath8 to agree with that of the inclusive data .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lam - rho42 ] .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath35 are much smaller than ( @xmath49/4 for low @xmath7 values and can be described by the following ad hoc parameterisation @xmath50 .",
    "the fact that the @xmath35 in the exclusive @xmath8 electroproduction is much smaller than @xmath7 of the photon might be due to the presence of the convolution of the soft @xmath8 wave - function and the small size longitudinal photon wave - function .",
    "this is a clear sign of the interplay of soft and hard physics  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the precision of the data on exclusive electroproduction of @xmath18 does not allow a similar study .    in principle , the question of the effective scale should not be an issue at all . if we were able to perform calculations in pqcd to all orders , we would know exactly what is the right scale .",
    "however , as long as we do not yet have a full calculation , precision measurements of exclusive electroproduction of vector mesons would be helpful to resolve this problem .",
    "the hera data are a good source to observe the interplay of soft and hard dynamics , through the study of energy dependences of different processes .",
    "the process of exclusive electroproduction of vector mesons at high scales is a good source to study perturbative qcd .",
    "it is important to understand the issue of the effective scale .",

    "the effective scale is much smaller than the @xmath7 of the photon .",
