    "this result suggests a very strong decline in the space density of the highest luminosity , most highly star forming galaxies , in the distant universe .",
    "smgs are outliers in the stellar mass - star formation rate relation in the @xmath21 universe ( daddi et al . 2007a ; takagi et al . 2008 ) , have gas kinematic signatures suggesting ongoing mergers ( tacconi et al . 2006 ; 2008 ) , have very compact sizes reminiscent of massive , evolved galaxies at @xmath23 ( daddi et al .",

    "therefore , searching for the very high redshift tail of smgs holds clues into understanding early type galaxy formation and characterizing the distribution of their formation redshifts , both crucial issues for galaxy formation models in a @xmath25cdm universe .",
    "the strong decline of smg counts at redshifts higher than @xmath21 might signal that @xmath21 is indeed the main formation epoch of massive early - type galaxy systems ( daddi et al .",

    "for example , if this population of @xmath23 early type galaxies were mainly formed during 100  myr long bursts within @xmath34 , one would expect to find @xmath35  mpc@xmath29 galaxies with sfr@xmath36  yr@xmath37 in the same redshift range , which would be detectable as smgs and with a sky density of @xmath38  deg@xmath39 .",

    "the slight difference in selection wavelength ( 850@xmath14 m versus 1.1 mm ) is likely not sufficient to justify the diverging results .",

    "given that star formation proceeds through the consumption of the molecular gas reservoirs , the detection of co emission is still the most secure means to measure the redshift of an smg .",

    "using multiwavelength photometric imaging data and keck spectroscopy , we identify the lines as co[4 - 3 ] transitions at @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "thanks to the serendipitous detection of co lines in the pdbi field of view , this reverses the typical smg counterpart identification process in which a plausible optical / near - ir counterpart with a measured spectroscopic redshift is only later confirmed through co observations .",
    "in addition , we provide spectroscopic ( co ) and photometric evidence for a second plausible counterpart to gn20.2 , likely at the same redshift .",

    "this would make a total of eight plausible @xmath12 smgs in goods - n in a total area of roughly @xmath294 arcmin@xmath202 covered with scuba ( with a highly inhomogeneous coverage ; see , e.g. , pope et al . 2005 ) , or roughly @xmath295 galaxies deg@xmath39 . using the volume in @xmath17",

    "2004b ) .      for the most reliable @xmath91 starbursts ( gn10 , gn20 , gn20.2a ) we notice that all of these have very high 20 cm to 24@xmath14 m flux density ratios , greater than about 1 ( fig .",

    "( 2008 ) also satisfies this criterion .    in principle",
    ", this simple criterion could be applied regardless of a submm detection , and could avoid the inherent bias toward intrinsically cold sources .",

    "given the promising results of this attempt , we will defer to future work an investigation of the properties of the full sample of galaxies selected with this radio/24@xmath14 m criterion .",

    "we now consider expectations for forthcoming _ herschel _",
    "surveys to detect very high redshift starbursts .",
    "_ herschel _ will obtain fir imaging with an unprecedented sensitivity at 70@xmath14 m , 100@xmath14 m and 160@xmath14 m with pacs ( poglitsch et al .",

    "the latter value is comparable , but still consistent , with the _ spitzer _",
    "70@xmath14 m upper limit .",
    "if these predictions are correct , galaxies similar to gn20 should be very easily detectable with _ herschel _ , e.g. , over the full 70  deg@xmath202 survey of the hermes guaranteed time consortiumsjo / hermes/. ] , which could yield hundreds @xmath6 hyperluminous infrared galaxies . even if we used a colder template following fig .",
    "[ fig : colors ] , normalized conservatively at a 1@xmath70 lower 850@xmath14 m flux density of 17  mjy , we would still predict flux densities of about 30  mjy at 350@xmath14 m and 520@xmath14 m , which is still above the expected flux limit of the 70  deg@xmath202 hermes survey .",
    "this suggests that , while strongly limited by confusion to quite bright flux densities ( @xmath320  mjy ; le  borgne et al .",
    "2008 ) , the _ herschel _ spire observations will efficiently detect a significant tail of very high redshift ( @xmath6 ) starbursts . due to the relation between redshift and 850@xmath14 m flux density ( ivison et al .",
    "2002 ; pope et al 2006 ) , _ herschel _ might detect the bulk of the most active merger - powered galaxies in the distant universe , and possibly accounting for an important fraction of the sfrd in the early universe .",

    "* dust continuum at 3.3 mm ( 0.65 mm rest frame ) is significantly detected for gn20 , the first such a measurement in a distant starburst galaxy .",
    "* we show that reliable radio - ir photometric redshifts ( to @xmath321 ) can be derived for these @xmath0 galaxies using only the photometry at 24@xmath14 m , 850@xmath14 m , 3.3 mm and radio 20 cm and ce01 models .",

    "the gn20 and gn20.2 smgs appear to live at the center of a strong sky overdensity of galaxies ( with an apparent size of @xmath326 comoving mpc ) , and a very significant redshift spike is seen over the full goods - n area , consistent with a proto - cluster .",

    "<S> we present the serendipitous discovery of molecular gas co emission lines with the iram plateau de bure interferometer coincident with two luminous submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) in the great observatories origins deep survey north field ( goods - n ) . </S>",
    "<S> the identification of the millimeter emission lines as co[4 - 3 ] at @xmath0 is based on the optical and near - ir photometric redshifts , radio - infrared photometric redshifts and keck+deimos optical spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> these two galaxies include the brightest submillimeter source in the field ( gn20 ; @xmath1mjy , @xmath2 ) and its companion ( gn20.2 ; @xmath3mjy , @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these are among the most distant submillimeter - selected galaxies reliably identified through co emission and also some of the most luminous known . </S>",
    "<S> gn20.2 has a possible additional counterpart and a luminous agn inside its primary counterpart revealed in the radio . </S>",
    "<S> continuum emission of 0.3mjy at 3.3 mm ( 0.65 mm in the rest frame ) is detected at @xmath5 for gn20 , the first dust continuum detection in an smg at such long wavelength , unveiling a spectral energy distribution that is similar to local ultra luminous infrared galaxies . in terms of co to bolometric luminosities , stellar mass and star formation rates ( sfrs ) , these newly discovered @xmath6 smgs are similar to @xmath7 smgs studied to date . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath8 smgs have much higher specific sfrs than typical b - band dropout lyman break galaxies at the same redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar mass - sfr correlation for normal galaxies does not seem to evolve much further , between @xmath9 and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> a significant @xmath0 spectroscopic redshift spike is observed in goods - n , and a strong spatial overdensity of @xmath11-band dropouts and irac selected @xmath12 galaxies appears to be centered on the gn20 and gn20.2 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a proto - cluster structure with total mass @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> using photometry at mid - ir ( 24@xmath14 m ) , submm ( 850@xmath14 m ) and radio ( 20 cm ) wavelengths , we show that reliable photometric redshifts ( @xmath15 ) can be derived for smgs over @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> this new photometric redshift technique has been used to provide a first estimate of the space density of @xmath17 hyper - luminous starburst galaxies , and to show that they both contribute substantially to the sfr density at early epochs and that they can account for the presence of old galaxies at @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> many of these high - redshift starbursts will be within reach of _ </S>",
    "<S> we find that the criterion @xmath18 , coupled to optical , near - ir and mid - ir photometry , can be used to select @xmath12 starbursts , regardless of their submm / mm emission . </S>"
