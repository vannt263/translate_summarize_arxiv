    "the qcd phase transition and quark - gluon plasma is currently one of the hottest topics in high energy nuclear physics.@xcite the recent high performance lattice simulation suggests that the order of the qcd phase transition in the real world , i.e. 2 massless quarks and 1 massive quark case , is first order.@xcite if the qcd phase transition is of the first order , the latent heat will be released at the phase transition temperature @xmath3 and an isothermal quark - gluon plasma(qgp)-hadron co - existing region will appear in the case that the change of the whole system is slower than the microscopic relaxation time . if such a scenario will be realized , the space time volume of the @xmath4 region can become significantly large , and physical quantities which are characteristic to the phase transition temperature @xmath3 will be available as the experimental signatures of the phase transition .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate how large a region with @xmath4 will be produced at the cern sps experiment and how clearly the hadronic mass shift at finite temperature can work as possible signatures of the phase transition .    as an equation of the state ,",
    "we here adopt the bag model which is one of the simplest models for the first order phase transition . the hydrodynamical model for the qgp fluid",
    "has already been discussed in many papers since bjorken first introduced the simple scaling model in 1 + 1 dimensional expansion@xcite .",
    "we discussed 1 + 1 dimensional expansion of the viscous fluid @xcite and 3 + 1 dimensional expansion with phase transition@xcite . based on the hydrodynamical model",
    ", we also discussed electromagnetic probe of qgp@xcite .",
    "as concerns the treatment of the first order phase transition , alam et al .  and kajantie et al .",
    "@xcite focused their discussion only on the transverse expansion based on the scaling ansatz .",
    "sollfrank et al .",
    "@xcite discussed a smeared equation of state with a small temperature width . in order to focus our discussion to the @xmath4 region",
    ", we solved 3 + 1 dimensional expansion keeping an equation of state with the exact first order phase transition .",
    "experimentally , at sps energy , net baryon number is not negligible even in the central region . in order to take correctly account of the baryon number conservation law",
    ", we must solve the coupled equations of hydrodynamics and baryon current conservation@xcite .",
    "however , if we adopt baryon number independent of an equation of state , the dynamics of the four velocity is free from the baryon conservation law and the role of the chemical potential is only for the calculation of the baryon number at the final stage@xcite . therefore , we may say that the baryon free fluid model works well enough in the discussion of space time evolution of the fluid with the simple bag model .",
    "the mass shift of the hadrons in the hot medium is believed to be a promising detectable signature of the high temperature region .",

    ", thermodynamical quantities are given by those of massless qgp gas with bag constant @xmath26 .",
    "in this paper , we assumed pions and kaons in the hadronic phase and u- , d- , s - quarks and gluons in the qgp phase . putting the phase transition temperature , @xmath27 mev , into the condition of pressure continuity , we can obtain the bag constant as @xmath28 mev/@xmath29 .",
    "at the phase transition temperature @xmath3 , pressure @xmath24 is continuous but other quantities such as energy density @xmath23 and entropy density @xmath30 have discontinuity as a function of temperature .",

    "we assume that thermodynamical quantities at @xmath32 are the functions of the space - time point through @xmath33 and given as , @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",

    "figure 3 displays the space time evolution of the temperature distribution in the pb+pb case .",
    "the isothermal region at phase transition temperature @xmath4 appears very clearly .",
    "the structure of temporal evolution does not differ essentially from the case of smooth phase transition in a small temperature region @xcite . by virtue of the use of the volume fraction @xmath31 at phase transition temperature",
    ", we can pick up the volume element with the temperature at just the phase transition point . the temperature profile function ( fig .",

    "as a signal of the hot hadronic region , shifted @xmath0 mass - spectrum and @xmath47 were proposed by hioki et al.@xcite and @xmath6 by asakawa et al.@xcite in these papers , authors discussed possible signals based on a scaling hydrodynamical model .",
    "we apply our ( 3 + 1)-dimensional hydrodynamical model to these calculation and investigate numerically how clear the shifted hadronic mass spectra appear in the present cern sps case .    according to ref .",

    "@xcite , and we adopt maxwell - boltzmann distribution for @xmath54 , that is , @xmath55 for simplicity . however , charmonium mass is much larger than the typical temperature of the fluid , above @xmath56 is almost constant and final results were dominated by the temperature profile function @xmath57 .",

    ".  5 and fig .  6 ,",
    "quantitative difference between s+au and pb+pb is consistent with the difference in the temperature profile functions ( fig .",
    "the yield of @xmath0 from @xmath3 is several orders smaller compared to the cold and thermal @xmath0 .",
    "however , the situation of @xmath5 is much better than @xmath0 : in our results , @xmath5 from the @xmath4 region is almost the same order as the others .",
    "hence , @xmath5 will be a better signature of @xmath4 than @xmath0 .",
    "these results are consistent with ref .  @xcite .",
    "because of the very small decay width of @xmath0 and @xmath5 , changes of the mass seem very clear and easy to detect . on the other hand ,",
    "their life time is much longer than the hot fire ball and the number of particles which decay in the hot medium is very small .",
    "therefore , shifted @xmath5 and @xmath0 are hardly detectable in the present experimental situation , but in future experiments with high precision , these can work as good signals .",
    "asakawa et al.@xcite started their discussion from the number of particles which decay in unit time and unit phase space which is given as , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the degeneracy of @xmath6 and @xmath62 is the lorentz factor of a moving particle .",
    "they imported the results of the qcd sum rule for the decaying constant in finite temperature , @xmath63 . from ( [ eqn : p1 ] ) we obtain @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the normalized smearing function to take account of experimental resolution .",

    "7 stands for the contribution of @xmath4 and the dotted line for the @xmath6 from the hot hadronic region .",
    "quantitative difference between yields in s+au(a ) and pb+pb(b ) are almost proportional to the difference in the temperature profile functions(fig .  4 ) .",
    "comparing to s+au , the ratio of the peak around 959 mev to the one around 1020 mev is large in the pb+pb case .",
    "these curves show clear difference as we expected , but the accumulated result ( solid line ) does not show distinguishable double peaks . in the accumulated results , we can find clear double peaks originating from the cold component and hot hadronic contribution , however it would not mean directly the existence of the qcd phase transition .",
    "we solved a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional hydrodynamical model with first order phase transition model(bag model ) .",
    "we can parameterize our hydrodynamical model so as to reproduce well the present experimental hadron spectrum .",
    "based on the numerical solution we discussed the space - time structure of the isothermal region at phase transition @xmath4 , which appears as a sharp peak in the temperature profile function . applying our numerical solution , we evaluated mass spectra of @xmath0 , @xmath47 and @xmath6 which have been proposed as possible signals for the existence of an isothermal @xmath4 region . according to our numerical investigation ,",
    "if the experimental resolution is as good as @xmath68 mev , we may have a chance to find the double - peak of the @xmath6 spectrum , but in the present cern sps pb+pb experiment , @xmath4 peak is indistinguishable from the hot hadronic contribution .",
