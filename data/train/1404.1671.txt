    "we are aiming to describe the response of thermo - visco - elastic material to applied external forces and the heat flux through the boundary .",
    "the system of equations capturing the displacement , temperature and visco - elastic strain of the body is a consequence of physical principles such as balance of momentum and balance of energy , cf .",
    "@xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the equations are complemented by the constitutive relation for the cauchy stress tensor and the constitutive equation for the evolution of the visco - elastic strain tensor .",
    "although we treat the case where the thermal expansion is negligible , but the changes of temperature affect the visco - elastic properties of the considered material . we shall observe it in the appearance of the temperature - dependent constitutive relation in the evolution equation for the visco - elastic strain tensor .",
    "we assume that the body @xmath0 is an open bounded set with a @xmath1 boundary and moreover , the body is homogeneous in space .",
    "the material undergoes two kinds of deformations : elastic and visco - elastic . by the first type we understand the deformations which are reversible and the second ones are irreversible .",
    "the problem is captured by the following system @xmath2 which describes the quasi - static evolution of the displacement of the material @xmath3 , the temperature of the material @xmath4 and the visco - elastic strain tensor @xmath5 .",
    "we denote by @xmath6 the set of symmetric @xmath7-matrices with real entries and by @xmath8 a subset of @xmath6 which contains traceless matrices .",
    "by @xmath9 we mean the deviatoric part ( traceless ) of the tensor @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the identity matrix from @xmath6 .",
    "additionally , @xmath13 denotes the symmetric part of the gradient of the displacement  @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 . the volume force is denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "the visco - elastic strain tensor is described by the evolutionary equation with prescribed constitutive function @xmath17 .",
    "the function @xmath17 is assumed to be monotone and to satisfy polynomial growth and coercivity conditions .",
    "the function @xmath18 is continuous with respect to @xmath19 and @xmath9 and satisfies for @xmath20 the following conditions :    * @xmath21 , for all @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; *",
    "@xmath24 , where @xmath25 , @xmath23 ; * @xmath26 , where @xmath25 , @xmath23 ,    [ ass_g ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are positive constants , independent of the temperature @xmath19 .",
    "we complete the considered problem by formulating the initial conditions @xmath29 in @xmath30 and boundary conditions @xmath31 on @xmath32 .",
    "the properties of the material under consideration determine the choice of the function @xmath33 .",
    "such a framework includes the classical norton - hoff model , cf .",
    "@xcite , which we shall briefly discuss in a sequel .",
    "there are various different relations considered , e.g.    * bodner - partom model @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 describes the isotropic hardening of the metal , @xmath36 stands for the positive part of @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are given functions and @xmath40 is a positive constant .",
    "moreover , functions @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 fulfill some specific properties .",
    "* mrz model @xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a continuous function . * prandtl - reuss model with linear kinematic hardening @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the indicator function of the closed and convex subset @xmath49 and @xmath50 are material parameters .",
    "furthermore , @xmath51 is a subdifferential of the function @xmath48 .    for further examples of constitutive relations ( e.g. classical maxwell model , models proposed by chaboche , hart , miler , bruhns and many others ) we refer to (",
    "* chapter 2.2 ) .",
    "our motivation for current considerations were the results of alber and chemiski @xcite and of hmberg @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors considered the quasi - static visco - elasticity models with norton - hoff constitutive function , namely of the power - law type @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 was either assumed to be a positive constant or dependent on an additional relaxation parameter described by a separate equation .",
    "the scheme of the proof in @xcite was to formulate the problem in a way that it fits to the abstract theory of maximal monotone operators , cf .",
    "@xcite . in the current paper",
    "we include the thermal effects of the process through the dependence of the constitutive function @xmath33 on the temperature .",
    "this dependence obstructs following the same scheme and requires different approach .",
    "furthermore , we assume that @xmath55 depends only on the deviatoric part of the cauchy stress tensor and its range is the set of traceless matrices .",
    "the last assumption , together with the fact that @xmath56 is traceless , provides that also @xmath57 is traceless .",
    "vanishing of the trace of the deformation tensor corresponds to preserving the volume of the material .",
    "indeed , the volume change is associated only with the elastic response of the material , and the plastic response is essentially incompressible , cf .",
    "the dependence of @xmath55 only on @xmath9 is essential to maintain the coercivity of the model .",
    "once we know that the range of @xmath33 is @xmath58 , then even for the isothermal process , namely the case of @xmath59 we observe that @xmath60 .",
    "then e.g. taking as @xmath10 the identity matrix we immediately see that @xmath61 .",
    "let us now comment on the technical consequences of this assumption .",
    "contrary to the proof of alber and chemiski , where they showed that @xmath10 belongs to @xmath62 for @xmath63 , the estimates conducted in the current situation provide only that @xmath10 belongs to @xmath64 .",
    "hmberg in @xcite considered more general physical phenomena including the electro - magnetic effects .",
    "the changes of temperature influenced the concentration of different phases of materials and this dependence was prescribed by some general operator @xmath65 $ ] having _ good _ properties . then the constitutive function describing the evolution of visco - elastic strain depends no more on the temperature , but on these concentrations .",
    "moreover it is linear with respect to the deviatoric part of the cauchy stress tensor , namely corresponds to the mrz model .",
    "the similarities with our approach are related with the construction of the approximated problem , namely by the truncation of the terms which appear on the right - hand side of the heat equation and are only integrable .",
    "the method also follows the framework of boccardo and gallout . nevertheless , because of the different structure of the problem",
    ", hmberg can show the strong convergence of the approximated sequence of the cauchy stress tensor .",
    "for the concept of showing this strong convergence observe that in the case of linear mrz relation , and in fact also in the case of norton - hoff relation , the stronger condition than monotonicity holds , namely the uniform monotonicity condition @xmath66 for the proof see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the studies on the mrz model presented in  @xcite essentially used the strong monotonicity of the function @xmath33 in the second variable . the existence proof used the methods developed in  @xcite arising from the tools of young measures . in the present setting none of the assumptions of strong nor uniform monotonicity are needed .",
    "we only assume monotonicity of @xmath33 .",
    "following bartczak @xcite , chemiski @xcite , chemiski and racke @xcite , duvaut and j.l .",
    "lions @xcite , johnson @xcite , neas and hlavek @xcite , suquet @xcite , temam @xcite and many others , we study the quasi - static evolution , i.e. the evolution , which is slow and we neglect the acceleration term in the equation for balance of momentum . moreover , we consider the model with infinitesimal displacement . in a consequence ,",
    "the dependence between the cauchy stress tensor and the symmetric gradient of displacement is linear ( generalized hooke s law , for more details see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "much of the approaches involve the models that are purely mechanical , namely concern the theory of inelastic and infinitesimal deformations with the nonlinear inelastic constitutive relation of monotone type , however neglect all thermal influences , see  @xcite and also @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the mathematical analysis of linear thermo - elasticity is also a classical , well understood topic , cf .",
    "@xcite , contrary to an analysis of thermo - inelastic models . by the thermo - inelastic models we mean the systems consisting of balance of momentum for kind of inelastic deformation and the equation for an evolution of the temperature . in the equation for balance of momentum for inelastic deformation",
    "the stress is not proportional to the strain , i.e. there appear term which absorbs the mechanical energy .",
    "there are only some results for special models or for simplified models in the literature @xcite .",
    "if we introduce thermal effects into various purely mechanical models , then the right hand side of the heat equation ( the product @xmath67 ) turns out to be only an integrable function .",
    "in such a case the standard energy methods fail and one needs to search for more delicate tools . using the boccardo and gallout @xcite approach to prove the existence of solutions to the heat equation the essential point is to use the truncation of the solution as a test function .",
    "this is however difficult to combine with a classical galerkin method as the truncation of a function may no longer be a linear combination of the functions from the galerkin basis .",
    "therefore we appeal to non - standard energy methods , such as two - level galerkin approximation , see also @xcite . the new difficulty which arises here is the construction of the appropriate basis for approximation of the strain tensor @xmath57 , for details see appendix  [ b ] .",
    "all functions appearing in this paper are the functions of position @xmath68 and time @xmath69 .",
    "we often omit the variables of the function and write @xmath14 instead of @xmath70 .",
    "all of the computation are conducted in lagrangian coordinates . in view of the fact that the displacement is small , the stress tensor in the lagrangian coordinates",
    "is approximated by the stress tensor in eulerian coordinates .",
    "this is a standard way of considering the inelastic models , for more details see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 13.2 ) .",
    "before we formulate the definition of weak solutions and state the main result of the paper let us introduce the notation @xmath71 .",
    "let @xmath63 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 be large enough .",
    "the triple of functions @xmath74 and @xmath75,w^{-s,2}(\\omega ) ) \\nonumber\\ ] ] is a weak solution to the system if @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 holds for every test function @xmath79,c^{\\infty}_c(\\omega,\\mathbb{r}^3))$ ] and @xmath80 .",
    "furthermore , the visco - elastic strain tensor can be recovered from the equation on its evolution , i.e. @xmath81 for a.e . @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "moreover , @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath63 and let initial conditions satisfy @xmath85 , @xmath86 , boundary conditions satisfy @xmath87 , @xmath88 and volume force @xmath89 and function @xmath17 satisfy the assumption [ ass_g ] .",
    "then there exists a weak solution to system .",
    "[ thm : main2 ]    there is nothing about the uniqueness of solutions in theorem [ thm : main2 ] . using boccardo and gallout approach to the heat equation",
    "we obtain the existence of @xmath19 only in the space @xmath90 for all @xmath72 , see the appendix .",
    "the lack of uniqueness of the temperature implies the lack of uniqueness of the solution to the whole system . in order to find the class of solutions providing both existence and uniqueness one should consider the renormalized solutions to the heat equation ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "however , the existing theory concerns mostly the homogeneous dirichlet boundary - value problems .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section [ druga ] is mostly dedicated to physical aspects of the problem .",
    "therefore in section [ sec : model ] we introduce the complete model and present the assumptions which brought us to the simplified setting . then in section [ comp ] we concentrate on physical justification of the model after simplifications .",
    "section [ sec:3 ] is only a technical part that prepares us to the proof of the main theorem , namely we transform the problem to a homogeneous boundary - value problem .",
    "the whole section [ sec : proof ] is devoted to the proof of theorem [ thm : main2 ] .",
    "the subsequent subsections correspond to the steps of the proof such as existence of the approximate solutions , boundedness of the approximate solution and the behaviour of the energy of the system .",
    "finally we pass to the limit in the galerkin approximations .",
    "we complete the introduction by introducing the notation . as a result of integration @xmath91",
    "we write @xmath92 which is equal to @xmath93 . furthermore ,",
    "we denote by @xmath94 standard lebesgue spaces , for @xmath95 and @xmath96 , by @xmath97 the sobolev spaces , by @xmath98 the fractional order sobolev space and by @xmath99 bochner spaces , by @xmath100 continuous functions on @xmath101 , by @xmath102 compactly supported smooth functions on @xmath101 .",
    "we will start the current section with formulating the full system describing the evolution of visco - elastic body including thermal effects .",
    "subsequently we describe the assumptions that were made due to simplify the system and motivate considering equations .",
    "the second part concerns the issue of thermodynamical completeness of the considered system .",
    "this part essentially follows @xcite .",
    "however , since this is an important argument for choosing this model , we include the main steps for completeness . in the last subsection",
    "we include the technical step which allows to reduce the problem to homogeneous boundary - value problem .",
    "let us consider the system of equations in the bounded domain @xmath103 with a @xmath1 boundary @xmath104 @xmath105    derivation of this system was presented in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the function @xmath106 is the cauchy stress tensor .",
    "the cauchy stress tensor can be divided into two parts : mechanical and thermal .",
    "the mechanical part is @xmath107 , where the operator @xmath108 is linear , positively definite and bounded . assuming that @xmath30 is a homogeneous material , the operator @xmath109 is a four - index matrix , i.e. @xmath110 and the following equalities hold @xmath111 the evolution of the visco - elastic strain tensor @xmath57 is governed by the constitutive relation @xmath112 .",
    "the visco - elastic strain tensor @xmath113 is traceless if @xmath114 is traceless .",
    "the temperature @xmath115 is the reference temperature .",
    "the function @xmath116 describes a given density of heat sources , @xmath117 is the material s conductivity , which in the case of homogeneous materials is a positive constant , @xmath118 is the constant density of the body .",
    "moreover , @xmath119 describes the thermal expansion of the body .",
    "we will study the simplified situation , namely under the following assumptions    we consider only the problem with small inertial force , i.e. @xmath120 .",
    "we assume that @xmath121 , i.e. the considered material is not subject to the thermal expansion .",
    "the fact of neglecting the acceleration term implies that the system of equations may be supplemented only by the initial conditions .",
    "moreover , we complete the system with boundary conditions . using",
    "the dirichlet condition for the displacement means that we control the shape of the body , and by using the neumann condition for the temperature we control the flow of the energy through the boundary .",
    "there are various simplifications that are proposed due to provide the mathematical analysis of the system . in the linear thermoelasticity ,",
    "the term connected with thermal expansion in the heat equation is approximated by a linear one , i.e. @xmath122 with the argumentation that the temperature @xmath19 in the considered process is close to the reference temperature , cf .",
    "bartczak @xcite , chemiski and racke @xcite .    from the point of view of mathematical techniques used in the linear theory , such as e.g. linear semigroup theory",
    ", this approximation seems to be accurate .",
    "unfortunately , in a consequence of this procedure one obtains the model which is not consistent with the physical principles .",
    "our simplification follows different way , we consider the case where no thermal expansion appears , hence @xmath121 . in the proceeding section",
    "we discuss in detail the issue of thermodynamical completeness of the system after the simplifications .",
    "finally , we also formulate the last assumption .",
    "we assume that there are no heat sources in the system , hence @xmath123 .",
    "the material s conductivity @xmath124 is for simplicity equal to @xmath125 .",
    "taking into account the above conditions we obtain the considered system .",
    "the purpose of the current section is to underline the physical advantages of the considered system .",
    "the assumptions used in the construction of the simplified model do not effect the loss of physical properties , i.e. the system still conserves the energy , the temperature is positive and there exists a function of state , namely the entropy , which has a positive rate of production .",
    "we shall say that the system is thermodynamically complete if these properties are satisfied . in @xcite",
    "we showed the thermodynamical completeness of the system  in the case it is isolated , i.e. @xmath126 , we assume homogeneous boundary values and there are no heat sources ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "all of the calculation in this section are formal .",

    "therefore , an arbitrary choice of the domain @xmath132 implies that the inequality holds @xmath151 the above relation is the so - called clausius - duhem inequality and it is one of the equivalent formulations of the second principle of thermodynamics .",
    "hence , the homogeneous boundary conditions and the definition of the heat flux ( @xmath152 ) implies that @xmath153 note that @xmath154 is one of the admissible entropies for system what furnishes a formal justification for the thermodynamical completeness of the model .",
    "for the situation with linearization of the term @xmath155 one can show that none of the thermodynamical principles is fulfilled .",
    "our aim is to reduce the problem to a homogeneous one . for this purpose",
    "we are interested in a decoupled elastic systems and a heat equation .",
