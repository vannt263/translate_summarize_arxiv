    "we are carrying out a long - term study of the variability of ppns .",
    "it initially began with radial velocity monitoring to search for possible binary companions .",
    "this was motivated in part by the idea that a binary companion could cause the dusty torus seen in bipolar ppns , which apparently restricts the outflow and results in the bipolar morphology @xcite .",

    "some preliminary observations of several of the sources were made in the summer of 1993 which indicated their variability .",
    "the observing program was begun in earnest in the summer of 1994 , with observations made using only the v filter .",
    "beginning in the summer of 1995 , occasional observations were made through the r filter to investigate color variations , and these were continued with increased frequency . since summer 2002 , the v and r observations have consistently been made together .",
    "the typical annual observing schedule involved frequent observations of the objects available in the summer and fall and infrequent observations during the winter and spring .",
    "unfortunately a defect developed in the v filter in 2000 that remained undetected for a long time . this has led us to reject all of the v data from 2451600 to 2452508 ( 2000 feb 25 day to 2002 aug 21 ) , resulting in a gap in the v light curves during that interval .",

    "this precision was obtained for all but the faintest sources ; integration times were limited to a maximum of @xmath06 min due to lack of a guiding system for the telescope .",
    "the observations were reduced using standard procedures in iraf to remove cosmic rays , subtract the bias , and flat field the images .",
    "aperture photometry was carried out , using an aperture of 11@xmath12 diameter .",
    "this accommodated the seeing quality of the site , which was typically @xmath03@xmath12 . only in the case of the fainter",
    ", southern lobe of afgl 2688 ( `` egg '' nebula ) was a smaller aperture ( 7@xmath12 ) used ; this was to avoid contamination by the brighter northern lobe of this large , bipolar nebula .",
    "standardized photometry of several of these ppns was carried out at the vuo on several nights using stars from the list of @xcite .",
    "we had previously obtained standardized photometry of most of them as part of our larger studies of ppns and these were previously published .",
    "we have listed all of these photometric results in table  [ std_ppn ] .",
    "many have very red colors due to reddening by their circumstellar dust .",
    "since our goal was to investigate variability in these ppns , the observing program was organized around differential photometry of the candidates with respect to non - variable comparison stars in each field .",
    "this allowed us to collect data on the many non - photometric nights available at our site .",
    "a set of three comparison stars was established in each ppn field .",
    "the comparison stars were chosen in such a way as to minimize the standard errors in the differential magnitudes .",
    "for the fainter ppns , they ranged from a little to a lot brighter and for the brighter ppns they were a lot fainter than the ppns ; for the bright ppns we were more limited in our choices . given the redness of our highly reddened ppns compared to the comparison stars , the color matches of the ppns and the comparison stars were usually not very close except for the f spectral type ppns .",
    "the constancy of the primary comparison star c1 in each field was established over this interval . in a few cases , small variability in c2 or c3",
    "is indicated .",
    "the level of constancy of the comparison stars c1 with respect to c2 is displayed in the subsequent light curve figures .",

    "the differential v , r , and ( v@xmath1r ) measurements of each ppn with respect to its primary comparison star c1 were transformed to the standard magnitude system and are listed in tables  [ tab_22223 ] through 17 .",
    "although in many cases we do not have a simultaneous set of v and r observations , we were able to carry out the standardization as follows .",
    "the color coefficients for standardization are small , + 0.030 for v and + 0.049 for r , and thus our instrumental differential magnitudes are close to the standard system . since none of the program stars vary much in color , @xmath13(v@xmath1r ) @xmath10 0.12 mag ( except 0.18 mag for iras 05113 + 1347 ) , a simple zero - point correction will bring the differential magnitudes close to the standard system .",
    "however , since there is a correlation between brightness and color ( see section  [ lc_trends ] ) , we were able to use this to make a very good approximation to correct for the star s color at each observation .",
    "differential extinction was small and was not applied to the observations .",
    "uncertainties were calculated for the differential measurements and are shown in the light curve plots to follow .",

    "the targets in this study are all post - agb objects in transition between the agb and pn phases in the evolution of intermediate - mass stars .",

    "the lack of distances and thus luminosities for these ppns prevents us from investigating directly a period@xmath1luminosity relationship ; however , the evidence in hand points more strongly to a period@xmath1temperature relationship based on the evolution of these objects across the hr diagram .",
    "while the rv tau stars also possess infrared excesses , they are generally much less than that seen in these ppns , for which about half of the flux is detected in the mid - infrared .",
    "this difference in circumstellar material points to a difference in the initial masses , with these ppns evolving from stars of higher initial mass than the rv tau variables , which are thought to evolve from low mass stars .",
    "thus these ppns , in general , tend to have longer periods and smaller amplitudes than the rv tau stars , without ( in most cases ) alternating differences in the depth of minima .",
    "recent radial velocity studies indicate that a significant fraction of rv tau stars ( and other dusty post - agb stars ) may be binaries in which the circumstellar dust is maintained by the gravitational interaction of the companion @xcite .",

    "post - agb stars evolve toward higher temperatures and the pn regime at rates that depend upon their envelope mass relative to their core mass .",
    "evolutionary calculations show that the evolution from the tip of the agb to the beginning of the ppn phase , from t@xmath20 of @xmath03000 to @xmath05000 k , will take much too long ( @xmath010@xmath22 years depending upon the core mass ) unless there is significant post - agb mass loss until t@xmath20 @xmath16 5000 k ( eg .",
    "various prescriptions for such ongoing mass loss have been applied @xcite .",
    "@xcite , in his models of post - agb evolution , made the assumption that the extensive mass loss rate does not simply terminate abruptly at the end of the agb phase , but rather that it decreases gradually in proportion to the decreasing radial pulsation period of the star .",
    "( this dependence of mass loss on the pulsation period is quite reasonable since pulsation seems to be the mechanism driving mass loss through dust formation on the agb @xcite . ) in most of his models , blcker assumed that the extensive mass loss rate began decreasing when the star had a pulsation period of 100 d and decreased down to a low reimers mass - loss rate as the period lowered to 50 d. he found from these models that the time scale for this evolution was relatively rapid , on the order of a several hundred years or less .",
    "this initial assumption was changed for one of his published models , in which he started the decrease in mass loss rate with the longer pulsation period of 150 d and decreased the rate as the period lowered to 100 d. in this later case , blcker found that the stellar evolution during this transition in mass loss rate happened much more slowly , @xmath02800 yr when beginning with p = 150 d as compared to @xmath0800 yr when beginning with p = 100 d ( with m@xmath23 = 3.0 m@xmath2 and m@xmath24 = 0.625 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "= 0.604 , 0.696 , 0.836 , and 0.940 m@xmath25 all had even shorter time scales of @xmath10 160 years for the decrease in mass loss rate , based on the mass loss decrease occurring between pulsation periods of 100 d and 50 d. ] thus this change to a longer initial period for the beginning of the decrease in extensive mass loss rate has the consequence of significantly slowing down the evolution of the star from the tip of the agb to the start of the ppn phase .",
    "the pulsation periods found in this present study can help inform these stellar evolution models .",
    "clearly the peak of the extensive mass loss has ended by the time the pulsation period is 150 d and the effective temperature is 5250 k. the seds of these ppns attest to this , for , with the exception of afgl 2688 , the central stars are not highly obscured and the double - peaked seds indicate that the circumstellar shell is detached .",

    "while some of these observed ppns do show a suggestion of some warm dust in their seds , which could be evidence for more recent , lower rate mass loss @xcite , one of the cases , iras 05113 + 1347 , has p = 133 d , again supporting the fact that the decline from the intensive mass loss begins at p @xmath27 100 d. an additional support for the longer initial evolution time scales is the fact that most of the 12 objects in this study have t@xmath20 @xmath17 7000 k ( 9/12 ) rather than t@xmath20 @xmath14 7000 k ( 3/12 ) , suggesting a slow initial evolution , since there should not be an observational bias against detecting the hotter c - rich ppns .",

    "this result suggests that the actual time scales to evolve to the central stars of pns is significantly longer than determined in the blcker models in which evolution with extensive mass loss continues until the pulsation period p = 100 d and then decreases .",

    "we will use the results of @xcite following the end of the decreasing mass loss from the agb to the reimers rate .",
    "although we showed above that time scale values from this model must be adjusted for the fact that the agb rate appears to end earlier than assumed in the model , the model evolutionary rate should still be appropriate in the reimers regime . as stated by @xcite ,",

    "@xcite find , for a carbon - rich star with m@xmath32 = 0.605 m@xmath25 , an evolution from @xmath30@xmath20 of 6050 k to 8500 k occurs in 675 years , or a rate of 3.6 k / yr . combining this with our empirically - determined average rate of change of pulsation period with @xmath30@xmath20 results in a rate of change in period of @xmath13@xmath29/@xmath13@xmath33 = @xmath10.17 d / yr or a change of @xmath13@xmath29 = @xmath12.4 d over the 14 year observing interval .",
    "such a change should be measurable with sufficient observations over a long enough baseline .",
    "we found a tentative value for the rate of period change of this order for two of the best observed cases ( section  [ p_evln ] ) .",
    "however , we caution that this is based on a relatively small temporal baseline and will need to be monitored for an additional decade or so before one can begin to feel confident in the results . also , the results would be strengthened by the addition of more ppns to the determination of the p@xmath1t@xmath20 relationship .",
    "we are in the process of carrying out a similar light curve study of oxygen - rich ppns .",
    "note that @xcite nicely outlined some of the general evolutionary aspects of pulsating post@xmath1agb stars that are in good quantitative agreement with the results found in this study .",
    "when we examine the p@xmath1t@xmath20 relationship on a logarithmic scale , we find a slope of @xmath13.5@xmath110.4 , within the range of @xmath13.0 to @xmath13.7 listed by sasselov and close to the theoretical value of @xmath13.72 based on the fundamental - mode pulsation in miras @xcite .",
    "the peak - to - peak range of the light variation also shows a trend with period .",
    "the ppns with the longest periods also have the largest light curve variations .",
    "listed in table  [ results ] is the maximum seasonal variation in the v band of each ppn . in figure",
    "[ delv - period - temp ] , these maximum variations are seen to decrease approximately monotonically with decreasing period and with increasing effective temperature .",
    "this decrease in light curve variation with p and with _ t_@xmath20 is what one would expect to see as the atmosphere decreases in size while the star evolves at constant luminosity toward higher temperature .",
    "note that these maximum seasonal variations are much larger than the amplitudes determined from the sine curve fitting to the long - term light curves ; this is at least partly due to the multiple periods or varying amplitudes inherent in these pulsating stars .",
    "the comparison of the light variations with pulsation periods shows a marked transition at period values of @xmath0120 - 130 d , below which the amplitudes are low and in the range 0.13@xmath10.23 mag , while at longer periods they are larger , in the range of 0.5@xmath10.7 mag .",
    "( iras 07430 + 1115 is the lone exception ; it is cool ( 6000 k ) with a long period ( 136 d ) but a small variation ( 0.23 mag ) . )",
    "this may suggest that at periods of 120@xmath1130 d is when the mass loss rate has ended the transition from a non - abrupt , decreasing agb rate to a lower post - agb rate .",
    "this appear to correspond to a temperature of @xmath06000 k. the larger light variations at the longer periods supports the idea that the pulsation is stronger and better able to drive mass loss at these periods .",
    "thus it may be that p @xmath16 125 d and t@xmath20 @xmath16 6000 k are the parameters where the decreasing agb mass loss ends and a lower post - agb mass loss begins .",
    "the observed values of pulsation period and brightness range can , in principle , be compared to pulsation models to both constrain the model parameters ( _ m , l , t@xmath20 _ , metallicity ) and to help interpret the observed light ( and velocity ) curves .",
    "@xcite has published a series of nonlinear pulsation models for cool post - agb stars with _",

    "his goal was to investigate the light curves of rv tau variables .",
    "these produced model light curves with shorter pulsation periods ( by about a factor of one - half ) than those observed for the cool ( 5250@xmath15500 k ) ppns in this study and with amplitudes much larger ( @xmath14 1 mag ) than found in the ppns . in a later study ,",
    "@xcite have presented a series of radiative , nonlinear pulsation models of post - agb stars with parameters in the following ranges : _ m _",
    "= 0.6@xmath10.8 m@xmath25 , _ t@xmath20 _",
    "= 5600@xmath16300 k , and _",
    "= 4500@xmath18000 l@xmath25 .",
    "these model parameters were chosen in part to fit the observed light and velocity curves of the ppn iras 07134 + 1005 .",
    "the results of these studies are that the light curve periods and amplitudes decreased with increasing temperature and also decreased with increasing mass and decreasing metallicity .",
    "more model calculations , with the explicit inclusion of convection and producing larger periods , are needed to help interpret these new ppn light curves .",
    "the observed maximum changes in @xmath13(v@xmath1r ) attributable to temperature changes , excluding the changes associated with trends in the brightness , are listed in table  [ results ] .",
    "these were transformed to changes in temperature based on the published temperatures and a color - temperature table of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 15.7 ) .",
    "these @xmath13_t@xmath20 _ values range from @xmath0300@xmath1750 k , with no correlation with _",
    "t@xmath20_. in some cases , such as iras z02229 + 6208 and 07430 + 1115 , these are likely lower limits since the r observations were few in the early years . as noted earlier , the observed ( v@xmath1r ) colors are reddened by the interstellar and particularly circumstellar dust , and thus the temperatures are derived from the spectroscopic analyses .",
    "the observed long - term trends in the brightness of a few of the ppns can most likely be ascribed to the effects of changes in the line - of - site circumstellar dust .",
    "iras 22223 + 4327 appears to get gradually fainter and iras 04296 + 3429 and afgl 2688 appear to get gradually brighter .",
    "afgl 2688 shows the largest change in brightness and gets measurably bluer as it gets brighter .",
    "iras 19500@xmath11709 shows a rapid drop in brightness , during which time it gets redder , and then a gradual rise in brightness during which it gets bluer .",
    "this can be explained by the sudden formation and more gradual dissipation of a dust cloud or the passage of a circumstellar dust cloud with a more opaque leading edge .",
    "in this study , we carried out a photometric v and r monitoring survey of 12 carbon - rich ppns over an interval of 14 years .",
    "this is the first systematic , long - term ( @xmath2710 yr ) light curve study of a homogeneous group of ppns .",
    "the targets were all of spectral type f and g. below are the primary results of this study .",
    "periods of the variations were found for all of the targets ( except perhaps afgl 2688 ) . these range from @xmath038 to 153 days , with a maximum v variation ( peak - to - peak within a season ) ranging from 0.13 to 0.67 mag .",
    "the objects with the later spectral types , mid- to late - g , have the longer periods and the larger variations .",
    "the objects show evidence for multiple periods and/or changing periods and/or changing amplitudes .",
    "two of them have light curves that suggest a longer beat period ( iras 22272 + 5435 and 22223 + 4327 ) and two of them have light curves with a suggestion of intervals of alternating deeper and shallower minimum ( iras 20000 + 3239 and z02229 + 6208 ) .",
    "nevertheless , all except the two with the shortest periods ( iras 07134 + 1005 and 19500@xmath11709 ) show a clearly dominant period in the data set .",
    "these results are consistent with the variation being due to pulsation and not binary interactions .",
    "an approximately linear correlation was found between the period of variation and the effective temperature over the temperature range observed in this study ( 5250@xmath18000 k ) , with the shorter periods associated with higher temperatures .",
    "the range of light variation is also seen to decrease approximately monotonically with temperature .",
    "the presence of pulsation periods as long as 150 d in ppns with detached shells implies that the intensive agb mass loss had ended before the period had decreased to 150 d. this has significant implications for modeling post - agb evolution rates , since the rates depend upon the level of post - agb mass loss . since some post - agb evolution codes tie the pulsation period to a mass loss prescription ( i.e. , blcker ) that assumes that intensive mass loss has ended by the time that the pulsation period has reduced to 100 d",
    ", these models will need to be revised .",
    "this would have the result of significantly increasing the initial stages of post - agb evolution .",
    ". an average rate of change of the pulsation period with time can be determined by combining the empirically - determined rate of variation of period with temperature and the model - dependent rate of change of temperature with time .",
    "these lead to an approximate rate of period change of @xmath10.2 d / yr , a rate that is potentially detectable within a few decades . our observations of individual ppns over this 14 year interval are complicated by the evidence for multiple periods , but give some tentative results that are not inconsistent with this value .",
    "as can be seen , the study of the light curves of ppns and the determination of their periods has the potential to constrain the models of post - agb stellar evolution and to reveal evolution in real time .",
    "in addition , these light curves together with radial velocity curves , when compared with appropriate pulsation models , have the potential to determine fundamental properties of the stars , such as mass and luminosity .",
    "these will be explored further in subsequent papers .",
    "we are continuing to monitor the light curves of many of this ppns to extend the time baseline .",

    "<S> the detection of periods as long as 150 d in these requires a revision in the published post - agb evolution models that couple the pulsation period to the mass loss rate and that assume that intensive mass loss ended when the pulsation period had decreased to 100 d. this revision will have the effect of extending the time scale for the early phases of post - agb evolution . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that real time evolution in the pulsation periods of individual objects may be detectable on the time scale of two decades . </S>"
