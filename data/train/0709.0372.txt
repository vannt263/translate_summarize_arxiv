    "since the scale separation used for les leads to the removal of subgrid scales mainly responsible for the energy dissipation , the subgrid model has to take into account this phenomenon .",
    "the flow in the cavity is confined and recirculating so that the same fluid is conserved inside the cavity .",

    "one can notice that the van cittert expansion series is convergent and the error increases with the filtering rate @xmath194 . in practical tests the deconvolution order must be set lower to @xmath195 in order to avoid having binomial coefficients of very high values which would inevitably induce precision errors .",
    "this numerical issue justifies the `` apparent divergence '' of the approximate deconvolution procedure for all filtering rate observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:06 - 02 ] for large values of @xmath40 . the filtering rate is increased from 1 to 9 by unit increments showing that the deconvolution error is larger with higher values of the filtering rate , which corresponds to the expected result .",

    "for this purpose , we assume that if subgrid scales exist , the flow is locally turbulent and energy is exchanged between subgrid and resolved scales .",
    "in other words , the activity of the term modeling subgrid scales is a direct indication of the turbulence occurring in the cavity flow .",
    "a measure of subgrid activity is given by the subgrid energy transfer @xmath227 defined by @xmath228 this latter quantity is only relative in value because the dissipation induced by the fluid viscosity , denoted by @xmath229 , @xmath230 is also responsible for an energetic action .",
    "it appears therefore legitimate to define and analyze the relative subgrid energy transfer @xmath231 which is referred to as subgrid activity in the sequel .",
    "if it is close to zero , the energetic phenomena are mainly induced by the viscous effects showing that the fluid is mainly laminar .",
    "conversely , values close to the unit indicate a strong energetic action of the subgrid model reflecting that turbulence is mainly responsible of energy transfers .    as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig:07 - 08 ] , turbulence essentially occurs in the vicinity of the cavity walls but , as expected , very close to the walls the energetic action is essentially due to viscous effects .",
    "high values of subgrid activity are also identified at the bottom of the cavity and near upstream and downstream walls .",
    "one can also notice that subgrid activity is clearly reduced at the edges of the elements .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the nature of the filter which is not active at the element - boundaries .",
    "this issue can not be avoided in this framework since @xmath117-continuity of the variables across elements is essential for numerical stability and physical consistency reasons .     from @xmath204 ( blue ) to @xmath175 ( red ) for adm - dms .",

    "see @xcite  as the difference between the total filtered kinetic energy and the kinetic energy of the resolved field @xmath235 , @xmath236 where @xmath237 is the modeled subgrid tensor defined in eq . .",
    "in order to provide the reader with deeper insight into the relative importance of the subgrid terms , we introduce the relative subgrid kinetic energy @xmath238 as the ratio between the subgrid kinetic energy and the kinetic energy of the resolved field @xmath239 as one can notice on fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa ] , the average values of @xmath238 reported in the plane @xmath240 , have negative values mainly located at the top - left corner of the cavity .",
    "this shows that the subgrid model predicts backscattering , that is the energy transfer from subgrid to resolved scales .",
    "this region of inverse energy transfer corresponds to the region of intense subgrid activity as reported in fig .",
    "[ fig:07 - 08 ] in the mid - plane @xmath196 .",
    "the importance of the subgrid terms already observed for the local energy fluxes and analyzed through the subgrid activity , is further confirmed by the presence of regions of intense @xmath241 .",
    "more precisely , four regions with high values of @xmath242 and corresponding to the zones where the wall - jets detach from their respective walls @xcite are easily identified in fig .",
    "[ fig:07 - 08 ] .    in order to highlight the zones where backscattering occurs , the iso - surface @xmath243 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : back ] thereby defining the boundary between the backscattering and the forward - energy transfer regions .",
    "this figure shows that this phenomenon mainly occurs below the lid and in the down flowing jet next to the downstream wall .",
    "it also demonstrates the need for a complex subgrid model with such anisotropic flows containing various flow conditions and no direction of homogeneity .",
    "les of newtonian incompressible fluid flows with adm based on the van cittert method using legendre - sem  have been performed .",
    "a coupling with a dynamic mixed scale model was introduced .",
    "the coupling of the lid - driven cubical cavity flow problem at reynolds number of 12000 with the sem  having very low numerical dissipation and dispersion appears to be a well suited framework to analyze the accuracy of the proposed subgrid model .",
    "the filtering operation is performed in a spectral modal space , generated by a hierarchical basis using the legendre polynomials , through the application of a specifically designed transfer function .",
    "this transfer function is constructed in order to ensure continuity across elements , conservation of the constants , invertibility of the filter and to perform low - pass filtering . from the computation viewpoint ,",
    "the filtering technique presented in this article , is the essential link between the sem and adm - based subgrid models .",
    "the validation of the deconvolution procedure performed using a dns velocity sample , shows that the van cittert method is convergent .",
    "accounting for the reduced sampling and integration time , the les performed with adm - dms show good agreement with the reference results .",
    "more precisely , first- and second - order statistics are in good agreement when compared to their dns counterparts .",
    "results for the reynolds stresses production , coupling first- and second - order statistical moments , are also well predicted using this new model even with such reduced sampling .",
    "the analysis of the results obtained with dms allows us to clearly identify the improvement induced by coupling adm with dms .",
    "subgrid activity has been analyzed showing a qualitative correlation with the localization of small - scale structures in the cavity depicted in @xcite .",
    "the importance of the subgrid kinetic energy as compared to the kinetic energy of the resolved field highlights the essential need for an appropriate subgrid modeling .",
    "furthermore , regions of backscatter are identified by adm - dms .",
