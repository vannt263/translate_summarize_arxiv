    "ten years after the discovery of the `` @xmath2 anomaly '' by the cdf collaboration  @xcite , no totally conclusive solution has been proposed so far ( for a comprehensive and up - to - date review on the subject , see  @xcite ) .",
    "even though the colour - octet mechanism ( com ) , coming from the application of nrqcd to heavy quarkonium , is a good candidate , it appears clearly that as long as fragmentation is the dominant production contribution and the velocity scaling rules of nrqcd hold , it can not accommodate the polarisation measurements of cdf  @xcite , which show a non - polarised , if not slightly longitudinal , production .    in that context , we have felt the necessity to reconsider the appropriateness of the static and on - shell approximation of the colour - singlet model ( csm )  @xcite , which is still the most natural model from qcd .",
    "these approximations are also implicit in the com , therefore any feature arising from this study should have some implication for the com .    in order to study properly non - static and off - shell effects , we have used a vertex function as an input for the bound state characteristics , whereas the schrdinger wave function at the origin is used in the csm and long distance matrix elements ( ldme ) of nrqcd enter the com .",
    "we emphasise again that we probe all the internal phase space of the quarkonium , and thus need a function , where the two models simply need a constant factor .",
    "in the case of @xmath4 quarkonium ( noted @xmath5 ) production in high - energy hadronic collisions , we are to consider gluon fusion @xmath6 . using the landau equations  @xcite , we have shown in  @xcite that there are two families of contributions ( see  fig .",
    "[ fig : diag_lo_qcd ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) : the first is the usual colour - singlet mechanism , where in the context of our model , we use a 3-point function @xmath7 at the @xmath8 vertex ; the second family was never considered before . to simplify the study , we set @xmath9 so that the first cut does not contribute .    for the functional form of @xmath10 , we neglect possible cuts , and choose two opposite scenarios : a dipolar form which decreases gently with its argument , and a gaussian form : @xmath11 and @xmath12 , both with a free size parameter @xmath13 , and a normalisation @xmath14 .",
    "in  @xcite , we have shown how to fix the normalisation @xmath14 of @xmath10 as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "in addition to the second family , one is driven  to preserve gauge invariance ( gi )  to introduce new contributions arising from the presence of 4-point vertices .",
    "besides restoring gi , these vertices have to satisfy specific constraints  @xcite . for the following simple choice for @xmath15 @xmath16\\gamma_\\nu,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the momenta and indices are as in  fig .  [",
    "fig : diag_lo_qcd ] ( c ) , we got for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 production at the tevatron the results shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : cross - section_01 ] . in the @xmath2 case , we employed the ambiguity upon the vertex function normalisation due to the node position @xmath17 to describe the data at low @xmath18 .",
    "note that the slope is not that different from that of the data .",
    "this is at variance with what is widely believed since fragmentation ( with a typical @xmath19 behaviour ) processes describe the data .",
    "however there exist different choices for the gi restoring vertex ( girv ) . in the following , we present some interesting results obtained by studying the effects of autonomous vertices .",
    "the latter link different suitable choices of girv : they are gi alone and a priori unconstrained in normalisation . for a first study ,",
    "let us restrict the choice to the three simplest possible ones  @xcite ( omitting the factor @xmath20 ) @xmath21    the factors @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are free constant .",
    "if we introduce these contributions in the amplitude calculation , we see in  fig .",
    "[ fig : g_m528_l600_cteq_10 - 8 ] that we can fit the data for some set of values for ( @xmath22 , @xmath24 ) .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to go beyond the static approximation of the csm .",
    "it may also be possible to extend the com in the same manner .",
    "this necessitates the introduction of 4-point vertices due to the non - local 3-point vertex relevant for the non - static and off - shell contributions .    by going deeper in the analysis",
    ", we see that the form of these 4-point vertices is not absolutely constrained even after imposing necessary conditions to conserve crossing symmetry and the analytic structure of the amplitude . when this lack of constraint is used , we are able to reproduce the cross - section for the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 as measured at the tevatron by cdf ( and also at rhic by phenix for @xmath1 ) .",
