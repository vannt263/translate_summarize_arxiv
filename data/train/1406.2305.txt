    "the discrepancy between quantum and classical mechanics over the description of physical phenomena has long been an object of interest and controversy .",
    "although quantum mechanics has been successful in describing and manipulating a microscopic world , a macroscopic world can interestingly be explained by classical mechanics that has different premises and framework from quantum mechanics .",
    "there has thus been much interest in accounting for the quantum - to - classical transition , and in particular , the decoherence by environmental interactions is nowadays perceived as one of the most promising models in this respect @xcite .",
    "recently , there have also been some different attempts to explain the quantum - to - classical transition @xcite .",

    ", where the obtained data do not fully characterize the state under investigation , we are interested in quantum state tomography : the process of inferring the prepared quantum state from the measured data @xcite . reconstructing the density matrix or the phase - space distribution of a quantum state , the process endeavors to provide the maximal information about the given state , which can also be used to verify nonclassical features , e.g. negativity in phase - space and entanglement . using the coarse - grained data from homodyne detection ,",
    "we may reconstruct a gaussian state and compare it to the same state under a gaussian noisy channel ( squeezed thermal environment ) , thereby comparing the coarse - graining model and the decoherence model in view of the quantum - to - classical transition .    in quantum optics , the inverse radon transformation of the marginal distribution acquired from homodyne detection",
    "was theoretically proposed @xcite and experimentally implemented @xcite to reconstruct the wigner distribution of a given state .",
    "however , the direct application of the inverse radon transformation yields an unphysical state due to the unavoidable process of data binning @xcite . to assure the legitimacy of the reconstructed state , quantum state estimation , which is to determine the most probable physical state from the measured data , was proposed @xcite and has been employed in experiments @xcite .",
    "we here employ two methods for state reconstruction under coarse - graining , namely , a direct reconstruction of the covariance matrix and a maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) @xcite .",
    "the coarse graining is equally applied to the homodyne measurement of each quadrature amplitude , and is therefore isotropic in phase space .",

    "sharing the reference frames between the preparer and the verifier can be a critical issue .",
    "we thus study how this issue can particularly affect the performance of the direct reconstruction method by considering cases with and without information on the phase of the input state .",

    "for the two - mode squeezed thermal states , the local homodyne distribution for each mode is isotropic as it has no bearing on the phase of two - mode squeezing , so that the estimated mean photon numbers are invariant even when the phase information is not available .",
    "only correlation parts vary under the rotation of the reference frame . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:2-performance ] , the difference in the performance between the two methods is thereby relatively less than that in fig .",
    "[ fig:1-performance ] .",
    "in addition , the mle method employing a full set of homodyne measurements again shows performance at the intermediate level .",
    "however , the distinctions are not very prominent , and in particular , those three methods yield almost the same results with the currently accessible coarse - graining ( @xmath145 ) @xcite . on the other hand , one can readily see that if an asymmetric input state with local squeezings is considered , the availability of the phase information can affect the results more significantly than here .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the reconstruction of a quantum state by a coarse - grained homodyne measurement . employing both the direct reconstruction method of the covariance matrix and the mle method , we examined single - mode and two - mode gaussian states to see how those states undergo quantum - to - classical transition .",
    "the reconstruction method has been compared to the decoherence model typically employed to account for the quantum - to - classical transition . in particular , as our coarse - graining models produce a gaussian output state from a gaussian input state , those models have been compared to the decoherence by a gaussian reservoir , i.e. , thermal squeezed reservoir .",
    "we have clearly shown that the coarse - graining model is not compatible with the decoherence model in addressing the state evolution and that the effects ( added noise ) of coarse - grained reconstruction are particularly state dependent in contrast to the decoherence program .",
    "even though the coarse - graining applies equally to all quadrature amplitudes , i.e. , isotropic in phase - space , it turns out that its effect on the state can be made equivalent only by a phase - sensitive reservoir with nonzero squeezing .",
    "furthermore , we also compared the performance between the direct reconstruction and the mle in terms of the fidelity and the nonclassicality of the output states .",
    "in general , the direct reconstruction method employing homodyne measurement of only three quadratures , therefore practically less demanding , can yield a better output than the mle method employing a full set of homodyne measurements .",
    "however , this is possible only when one has access to the information on the phase of the input state . if the phase information is not available , the mle method yields better results than the direct reconstruction . in a practical regime of ,",
    "e.g. , @xmath172 , all those methods yield almost identical results .    as a concluding remark",
    ", the reconstruction under a coarse - grained homodyne measurement generally yields a non - gaussian distribution , i.e. , the piecewise flat distribution in fig .",
    "1 . therefore , even though we know that the input state is a gaussian state , it will be interesting to study how the characteristics of the reconstructed state can be modified if the mle method is applied with reference to a set of non - gaussian states .",
    "that is , we take the estimated states to be non - gaussian and investigate the fidelity and the nonclassicality of the output states , which will be left for future study together with the case of non - gaussian input states .",
