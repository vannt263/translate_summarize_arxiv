    "the game of cops and robbers ( defined , along with all the standard notation , later in this section ) is usually studied in the context of the _ cop number _ , the minimum number of cops needed to ensure a winning strategy .",
    "the cop number is often challenging to analyze ; establishing upper bounds for this parameter is the focus of meyniel s conjecture that the cop number of a connected @xmath12-vertex graph is @xmath13 for additional background on cops and robbers and meyniel s conjecture , see the book  @xcite .",
    "a number of variants of cops and robbers have been studied .",
    "for example , we may allow a cop to capture the robber from a distance @xmath14 , where @xmath14 is a non - negative integer  @xcite , play on edges  @xcite , allow one or both players to move with different speeds  @xcite or to teleport , allow the robber to capture the cops  @xcite , make the robber invisible or drunk  @xcite , or allow at most one cop to move in any given round  @xcite .",
    "see chapter  8 of  @xcite for a non - comprehensive survey of variants of cops and robbers .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a variant of the game of cops and robbers , called _ containment _ , introduced recently by komarov and mackey  @xcite . in this version ,",
    "cops move from edge to adjacent edge , the robber moves as in the classic game , from vertex to adjacent vertex ( but can not move along an edge occupied by a cop ) .",
    "formally , the game is played on a finite , simple , and undetected graph .",
    "there are two players , a set of _ cops _ and a single _",
    "robber_. the game is played over a sequence of discrete time - steps or _ turns _",
    ", with the cops going first on turn @xmath15 and then playing on alternate time - steps .",
    "a _ round _ of the game is a cop move together with the subsequent robber move .",
    "the cops occupy edges and the robber occupies vertices ; for simplicity , we often identify the player with the vertex / edge they occupy .",
    "when the robber is ready to move in a round , she can move to a neighbouring vertex but can not move along an edge occupied by a cop , cops can move to an edge that is incident to their current location .",
    "players can always _ pass _ , that is , remain on their own vertices / edges .",
    "observe that any subset of cops may move in a given round .",
    "the cops win if after some finite number of rounds , all edges incident with the robber are occupied by cops .",
    "this is called a _",
    "capture_. the robber wins if she can evade capture indefinitely .",
    "winning strategy for the cops _ is a set of rules that if followed , result in a win for the cops .",
    "a _ winning strategy for the robber _ is defined analogously . as stated earlier",
    ", the original game of _ cops and robbers _ is defined almost exactly as this one , with the exception that all players occupy vertices .",
    "if we place a cop at each edge , then the cops are guaranteed to win .",
    "therefore , the minimum number of cops required to win in a graph @xmath1 is a well - defined positive integer , named the _ containability number _ of the graph @xmath16 following the notation introduced in  @xcite , we write @xmath0 for the containability number of a graph @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the original _ cop - number _ of @xmath1",
    ".    in  @xcite , komarov and mackey proved that for every graph @xmath1 , @xmath17 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the domination number and the maximum degree of @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "it was conjectured that the upper bound can be strengthened and , in fact , the following holds .",
    "[ con : komarov ] for every graph @xmath1 , @xmath6 .",
    "observe that , trivially , @xmath7 so this would imply the previous result .",
    "this seems to be the main question for this variant of the game at the moment . by investigating expansion properties ,",
    "we provide asymptotically almost sure bounds on the containability number of binomial random graphs @xmath8 for a wide range of @xmath9 , proving that the conjecture holds for some ranges of @xmath10 ( or holds up to a constant or an @xmath11 multiplicative factors for some other ranges of @xmath10 ) . however , before we state the result , let us introduce the probability space we deal with and mention a few results for the classic cop - number that will be needed to examine the conjecture ( since the corresponding upper bound is a function of the cop number ) .",
    "the _ random graph _ @xmath8 consists of the probability space @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the set of all graphs with vertex set @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the family of all subsets of @xmath19 , and for every @xmath22 , @xmath23 this space may be viewed as the set of outcomes of @xmath24 independent coin flips , one for each pair @xmath25 of vertices , where the probability of success ( that is , adding edge @xmath26 ) is @xmath27 note that @xmath9 may ( and usually does ) tend to zero as @xmath12 tends to infinity .",
    "all asymptotics throughout are as @xmath28 ( we emphasize that the notations @xmath29 and @xmath30 refer to functions of @xmath12 , not necessarily positive , whose growth is bounded ) .",
    "we say that an event in a probability space holds _ asymptotically almost surely _ ( or _ a.a.s .",
    "_ ) if the probability that it holds tends to @xmath31 as @xmath12 goes to infinity .",
    "let us now briefly describe some known results on the ( classic ) cop - number of @xmath8 .",
    "bonato , wang , and the author of this paper investigated such games in @xmath8 random graphs and in generalizations used to model complex networks with power - law degree distributions ( see  @xcite ) . from their results",
    "it follows that if @xmath32 for some @xmath33 , then a.a.s .",
    "we have that @xmath34 so meyniel s conjecture holds a.a.s .  for such @xmath10",
    "in fact , for @xmath35 we have that a.a.s .",
    "a simple argument using dominating sets shows that meyniel s conjecture also holds a.a.s .   if @xmath10 tends to 1 as @xmath12 goes to infinity ( see  @xcite for this and stronger results ) .",
    "bollobs , kun and leader  @xcite showed that if @xmath37 , then a.a.s .",
    "@xmath38 from these results , if @xmath39 and either @xmath40 or @xmath41 , then a.a.s .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , between these values it was shown by uczak and the author of this paper  @xcite that the cop number has more complicated behaviour .",
    "it follows that a.a.s .",
    "@xmath43 is asymptotic to the function @xmath44 shown in figure  [ fig1 ] ( denoted in blue ) .",
    "formally , the following result holds for the classic game .",

    "the author of this paper and wormald showed recently that the conjecture holds a.a.s .",
    "in @xmath8  @xcite as well as in random @xmath57-regular graphs  @xcite .    finally , we are able to state the result of this paper .",

    "it follows that a.a.s .",
    "@xmath61 is asymptotic to the function @xmath62 shown in figure  [ fig1 ] ( denoted in red ) .",
    "the fact the conjecture holds is associated with the observation that @xmath63 , which is equivalent to saying that a.a.s .  the ratio @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , let us mention that theorem  [ thm : main ] implies that the conjecture is best possible ( again , up to a constant or an @xmath11 multiplicative factors for corresponding ranges of @xmath10 ) .",
    "note that in the above result we skip the case when @xmath65 for some positive integer @xmath14 or @xmath40 .",
    "it is done for a technical reason : an argument for the lower bound for @xmath66 uses a technical lemma from  @xcite that , in turn , uses corollary 2.6 from  @xcite which is stated only for @xmath67 , where @xmath68 for any positive integer @xmath14 .",
    "clearly , one can repeat the argument given in  @xcite , which is a very nice but slightly technical application of the polynomial concentration method inequality by kim and vu .",
    "however , in order to make the paper easier and more compact , a ready - to - use lemma from  @xcite is used and we concentrate on the `` linear '' parts of the graph of the zigzag function .",
    "nonetheless , similarly to the corresponding result for @xmath69 , one can expect that , up to a factor of @xmath70 , the result extends naturally also to the case @xmath65 as well .",
    "on the other hand , there is no problem with the upper bound so the case when @xmath65 for some positive integer @xmath14 is also investigated ( see below for a precise statement ) .",
    "moreover , some expansion properties that were used to prove that meyniel s conjecture holds for @xmath8  @xcite are incorporated here to investigate sparser graphs .",

    "one edge incident to @xmath73 ( the edge @xmath138 that belongs to the perfect matching used ) is already occupied by a cop ( in fact , by two cops , associated with @xmath73 and @xmath139 ) .",
    "moreover , the remaining cops can move so that all edges incident to @xmath73 are protected and the game ends . indeed , for each edge @xmath140 , the cop associated with @xmath141 moves to @xmath140 .",

    "finally , by the assumption that @xmath73 is safe , we have @xmath244 , provided that @xmath245 ; the corresponding conditions for @xmath246 and @xmath226 are trivially true , since both can be bounded from above by @xmath175 , the total number of cops . combining all of these yields @xmath247 and consequently @xmath248 , as required .",
    "thus , there at most @xmath249 of neighbours of @xmath73 are @xmath92-dangerous for some @xmath250 .",
    "since we have @xmath251 neighbours to choose from ( see lemma  [ lem : elem1](i ) ) , there are plenty of neighbours of @xmath73 which are not @xmath92-dangerous for any @xmath252 and the robber might want to move to one of them .",
    "however , there is one small issue we have to deal with . in the definition of being dangerous",
    ", we consider the graph @xmath253 whereas in the definition of being safe we want to use @xmath254 instead .",
    "fortunately , lemma  [ lem : elem2](iv ) implies that we can find a neighbour @xmath227 of @xmath73 that is not only not dangerous but also @xmath217 does not belong to the @xmath255-neighbourhood of @xmath227 in @xmath256 .",
    "it follows that @xmath229 is not occupied by a cop and @xmath257 for @xmath232 or @xmath233 , where @xmath234 .",
    "we move the robber to @xmath227 .",
    "now , it is time for the cops to make their move .",
    "because of our choice of the vertex @xmath227 , we can assure that the desired upper bound for @xmath258 required for @xmath227 to be safe will hold for @xmath259 .",
    "indeed , the best that the cops can do to try to fail the condition for @xmath258 is to move all cops at distance @xmath260 and @xmath261 from @xmath227 to @xmath92-neighbourhood of @xmath227 , and to make cops at distance @xmath92 stay put , but this would not be enough .",
    "thus , regardless of the strategy used by the cops , @xmath227 is safe and the proof is finished .",
    "the proof is very similar to that of lemma  [ lemma : lowerbound1 ] .",
    "the only difference is that checking the desired bounds for @xmath264 and @xmath265 is slightly more complicated .",
    "as before , we do not control the number of cops in @xmath266 and @xmath225 , clearly @xmath267 and @xmath268 are bounded from above by @xmath269 , the total number of cops .",
    "we get @xmath270 and consequently @xmath271 , as required .",
    "( note that we have room to spare here but we can not take advantage of it so we do not modify the definition of being @xmath272-dangerous . )    let us now notice that a cop at distance @xmath224 from @xmath73 can contribute to the `` dangerousness '' of more than @xmath273 neighbours of @xmath73 .",
    "however , the number of paths of length @xmath255 joining @xmath73 and @xmath83 is bounded from above by @xmath274 ( see lemma  [ lem : elem2](ii ) and note that @xmath275 , since @xmath276 ) . hence , @xmath277 and , as desired , @xmath278 .",
