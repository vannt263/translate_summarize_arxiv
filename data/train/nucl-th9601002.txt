    "in contrast to the @xmath3-interaction , little is known about the @xmath4-interaction and , consequently , about the @xmath5 vertex . in the case of pion scattering and pion photoproduction",
    "the @xmath6 coupling is preferred to be pseudovector ( pv ) , in accord with current algebra results and chiral symmetry .",
    "however , because the eta mass is so much larger than the pion mass - leading to large su(3 ) x su(3 ) symmetry breaking - and because of the @xmath7 mixing there is no compelling reason to select the pv rather than the ps form for the @xmath5 vertex .    the uncertainty regarding the structure of the @xmath5 vertex extends to the magnitude of the coupling constant .",
    "this coupling constant @xmath8 varies between @xmath9 and @xmath10 with the large couplings arising from fits of one boson exchange potentials .",
    "typical values obtained in fits with obep potentials @xcite can lie anywhere between 3 - 7 .",
    "however , including the @xmath11 yields only small effects in fitting the @xmath12 phase shifts and , furthermore , provides an insignificant contribution to nuclear binding at normal nuclear densities .",
    "furthermore such obep potentials use the eta as an effective meson to describe effects of more elaborate two - meson correlations .",
    "this can be seen in the full bonn potential , where the eta coupling is below 1 and can be neglected in the calculations @xcite . from su(3 ) flavor symmetry all coupling constants between the meson octet and the baryon octet are determined by one free parameter @xmath13 , giving @xmath14 the resulting values for the coupling constant lie between @xmath15 and @xmath16 for commonly used values of @xmath13 between @xmath17 and depend on the f and d strengths chosen as the two types of su(3 ) octet meson - baryon couplings .",
    "other determinations of the @xmath5 coupling employ reactions involving the eta , such as @xmath18 , and range from @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "smaller values are supported by @xmath12 forward dispersion relations @xcite with @xmath20 .",
    "there is some rather indirect evidence that also favors a small value for @xmath21 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , piekarewicz calculated the @xmath22@xmath11 mixing amplitude in the hadronic model where the mixing was generated by @xmath23 loops and thus driven by the proton  neutron mass difference . to be in agreement with results from chiral perturbation theory the @xmath24 coupling had to be constrained to the range @xmath25 . in a very different approach ,",
    "hatsuda @xcite evaluated the proton matrix element of the flavor singlet axial current in the large @xmath26 chiral dynamics with an effective lagrangian that included the @xmath27(1 ) anomaly . in this framework",
    ", the emc data on the polarized proton structure function ( which have been used to determine the `` strangeness content '' of the proton ) can be related to the @xmath28 and the @xmath24 coupling constants .",
    "again , his analysis prefers small values for both coupling constants .",
    "nevertheless , from the above discussion it seems clear that the @xmath5 coupling constant is much smaller compared to the corresponding @xmath6 value of around 14 .    in a recent analysis of @xmath11 photoproduction on the proton @xcite both nature and magnitude",
    "could be determined in a comparison of a dynamical model with new high accuracy data from mainz @xcite . in this calculation",
    "the resonance sector includes the @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 states whose couplings are fixed by independent electromagnetic and hadronic reactions like @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the nonresonant background is described by vector meson exchange contributions and s- and u - channel born terms , where the @xmath5 coupling constant enters . by comparison with the data on total and differential cross sections the couping constant was determined as @xmath36 with a clear preference for a pseudoscalar type .",
    "the aim of this paper is to calculate the pseudovector as well as the pseudoscalar coupling constant of the @xmath2 meson to the nucleon . in section 2",
    "we analyze the different structures of the isosinglet and isotriplet axial vector nucleon currents on the quark level to motivate the smallness of the pseudovector @xmath0 coupling ( subsequently denoted by @xmath37 ) relative to the corresponding pseudovector @xmath3 coupling ( denoted by @xmath38 ) .",
    "in fact , in contrast to the isotriplet axial current the isosinglet axial vector current of the nucleon does not contain any component formed of the isodoublet @xmath39 and @xmath40 quarks of the first quark generation but is determined exclusively by the isosinglet @xmath41 and @xmath42 quarks belonging to the second quark generation .",
    "the ( pointlike ) pseudovector @xmath0 coupling will be therefore exclusively determined by the presence of strange / charmed quarkonium component both in the meson wave function and the nucleon current and expected to be rather small . in this",
    "context vertex corrections can acquire importance .",
    "we here advocate the idea to treat the coupling of strange quarkonium to the nucleon by means of triangular vertices involving appropriate nonstrange mesons .",
    "in section 3 we consider the long range @xmath43 triangle diagram as a model for the mixture of the pseudoscalar and pseudovector @xmath5 vertices , derive analytical expressions for @xmath21 and @xmath37 and fix in a natural way their relative sign .",
    "the special role of the @xmath1 triangle diagram as the dominant one  loop mechanism for the @xmath0 coupling is singled out by the circumstance that the @xmath44 meson is the lightest meson with a two particle decay channel containing the @xmath2 particle @xcite .",
    "the contributions of heavier mesons such as the isotriplet @xmath45 tensor meson with an @xmath46 decay channel and the isoscalar @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 tensor mesons with @xmath50 decay channels will be left out of consideration because of the short range character of the corresponding triangle diagrams on the one side , triangular vertex . ] and because of the comparatively small couplings of the tensor mesons to the nucleon @xcite on the other side .    in section 4",
    "we show that the small value of @xmath36 , as obtained from fits of the photoproduction amplitude @xcite is well reproduced in terms of the @xmath1 triangular @xmath0 coupling if complete dominance of the full @xmath51 decay width by the @xmath52 decay channel is assumed and use is made by the version of the bonn potential with the lowest value for the @xmath53 coupling constant @xcite .",
    "the paper ends with a short summary .",
    "within the su(3 ) flavor symmetry scheme the neutral weak axial current of the nucleon @xmath54 following from the glashow  weinberg ",
    "salam electroweak gauge theory is given by the matrix element of the corresponding quark currents as @xmath55 this may be reduced to @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the weak isovector axial coupling constant , @xmath58 denotes the weak isoscalar axial coupling ( @xmath57= 1.25 , @xmath59 @xcite ) , @xmath60 stands for the dirac bi ",
    "spinor of the nucleon , whereas @xmath61 and @xmath62 in turn denote the isotriplet and isosinglet axial vector nucleon currents .",
    "the matrix element of the isoscalar axial vector current between the @xmath63 pseudoscalar mesons and a @xmath64state is defined in the standard way as    @xmath65    here @xmath66 and @xmath67 denote in turn the mass and the coupling constant of the respective meson ( @xmath68 ) to the hadronic vacuum .    in the three flavor quark model , the wave functions of the low lying pseudoscalar mesons are described as linear combinations of quark  antiquark ( @xmath69 ) pairs .",
    "the physical singlet and scalar states within the pseudoscalar meson octet corresponding to the @xmath70 and the @xmath2 mesons are moreover predicted to be mixed according to @xmath71 with the mixing angle @xmath72 @xcite being determined from mass formulae .",
    "the presence of a strange quarkonium component in the pseudoscalar isoscalar mesons is equivalent to a violation of the okubo ",
    "iizuka rule predicting the suppression of @xmath73 transitions .",
    "the evaluation of the matrix element of the isoscalar axial vector current between the @xmath2 meson state and the hadronic vacuum is based on the qcd suggestion @xcite that a quark @xmath74 of flavor @xmath75 in the pseudoscalar mesons couples only to the current @xmath76 of the same flavor and that the coupling strength @xmath77 is flavor independent @xmath78    here , @xmath79 denotes the weight of the @xmath80 quarkonium in the wave function of the pseudoscalar meson ( @xmath81 ) considered .",
    "( 3 ) shows that in contrast to the isoscalar vector current , the isoscalar axial vector current of the nucleon contains no non  strange component .",
    "because of that the pointlike coupling of the isosinglet pseudoscalar mesons to the corresponding nucleon current is realized only via their strange quarkonium components , in which case one has @xmath82 while for the pion one has + @xmath83    insertion of eqs .",
    "( 7 - 9 ) into ( 6 ) and a subsequent comparison with ( 4 ) lead on one side to @xmath84 where we made use of the empirical value for the ( dimensionless ) pion decay coupling constant @xmath85 . on the other side , with that the coupling strength @xmath77 is calculated as @xmath86 and the values of @xmath87 and @xmath88 are completely determined by @xmath89 respectively . to get a rough understanding of the origin of the pseudovector @xmath0 , @xmath90 and @xmath3 couplings introduced via the corresponding lagrangians as @xmath91 it is quite instructive to consider a  toy",
    " model in which universality of the axial currents of the pseudoscalar meson is assumed for the moment ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this would allow one to obtain the following parametrizations @xmath92 where use has been made of the on  shell equivalence between the pseudoscalar and pseudovector meson nucleon couplings leading to the relation @xmath93 .",
    "the usefulness of the  universality  ansatz is best demonstrated for the case of the pion where the empirical value of @xmath94 as deduced with a good accuracy from chiral symmetry constraints is only few percent larger than the one concluded from the  universality  arguments as @xmath95 .",
    "for the case of the charged axial vector current  universality  is equivalent to the goldberger ",
    "treiman ( gt ) relation and thus to current conservation in the chiral limit of a vanishing pion mass . for the case of the isoscalar axial vector current , however , the  toy  model is less useful as it would suggest a gt  like relation between @xmath96 and @xmath97 , which is unrealistic in view of the axial anomaly problem .",
    "nontheless , the considerations given above are instructive in a sense that they clearly illustrate the fundamental difference between the couplings of isovector and isoscalar pseudoscalar mesons to the axial nucleon current . whereas the pseudovector @xmath98 coupling relies on the strange component of the axial vector current , its purely non strange component is relevant for the pseudovector @xmath3 coupling .",
    "( 10 - 12 ) together with eqs .",
    "( 15 - 17 ) lead to the following relations @xmath99 eq .",
    "( 19 ) shows that the @xmath0 vertex appears suppressed relative to the @xmath3 vertex by at least one order of magnitude .",
    "for this reason we expect the much larger experimentally observed @xmath0 couplings @xmath100 to be governed mainly by the effective @xmath101 triangular vertex rather than by the contact meson ",
    "current couplings considered in the  toy  model above .    in the following section we consider an effective @xmath5 vertex associated with the @xmath101 triangle diagram ( fig .",
    "2 ) , which is the dominant long range one loop mechanism for the isoscalar axial nucleon coupling , and calculate both the values of @xmath37 and @xmath21 associated with this vertex .",
    "the @xmath103 triangle diagram is calculated using the following effective lagrangians for the @xmath104 decay , the @xmath3 and the @xmath105 couplings :    @xmath106    here @xmath38 and @xmath107 in turn denote the pseudovector @xmath3 and the scalar @xmath53 coupling constants , for which we adopt the values @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "these values are implied by the relativistic bonn one boson exchange potential ( obepq ) for the nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite . to regularize the integral in the triangle diagrams in fig .",
    "2 we introduce the same monopole form factors at the @xmath22nn and @xmath51nn vertices as established by the bonn potential model . the following contribution to the @xmath5 vertex",
    "is then obtained : @xmath110 here @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the cut - off parameters in the monopole vertex factors , for which we use the values 1.05 gev and 2.0 gev , respectively . the functions @xmath113 and @xmath114 are defined as @xmath115 the @xmath0 coupling constant is obtained by setting @xmath116 in eq .",
    "the corresponding expression for the pseudovector coupling reads : @xmath117",
    "using for @xmath118 the value of 0.44 extracted from the experimental decay width @xcite when ascribing the total @xmath51 decay width to the @xmath119 decay channel , we obtain @xmath120 these are the quantities which we shall interpret as the values for the pseudoscalar and pseudovector coupling constants , respectively .",
    "the main sources of uncertainty in the parametrization of the @xmath5 coupling constants by means of the triangular @xmath1 diagram are associated with the @xmath121 coupling constant and the @xmath122 fraction .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath107 varies between @xmath123 and @xmath124 depending on the @xmath12 potential model version @xcite . in view of the @xmath125 mesonium structure of the @xmath51 meson @xcite",
    "the @xmath105 coupling will be mainly governed by the short range @xmath126 intermediate configuration and therefore expected to be small .",
    "for this reason we favor in the present investigation the versions of the bonn potential with the lowest @xmath127 values reported .",
    "it should further be pointed out that an increase of @xmath21 and @xmath37 implied by a larger @xmath127 value can be compensated to a large amount by the reduction of the @xmath128 partial width from the 100% used by us to a lower and more realistic value .",
    "the size of the coupling constants obtained in the present study can therefore be viewed as realistic .",
    "note that the pseudovector @xmath0 effective coupling constant associated with the @xmath101 triangle is about three times larger as compared to the corresponding toy model value in eq .",
    "this observation underlines the importance of effective vertices for the coupling of the strange quarkonium to the nucleon ( compare @xcite for previous work ) .",
    "our result can be reformulated in terms of an effective @xmath5 lagrangian with ps - pv mixing @xcite that was also discussed in eta photoproduction before @xcite @xmath129                              \\psi(x)\\,\\ ] ] with @xmath130 being a mixing parameter between the two limiting cases of pv coupling ( @xmath131 ) and ps coupling ( @xmath132 ) . in combination with eqs .",
    "( 26 - 27 ) we obtain @xmath133 in fig .",
    "3 we show a calculation of eta photoproduction using our coupling constants in comparison with the experimental data .",
    "we also compare with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite obtained in ps coupling with their best - fit coupling constant of @xmath134 .",
    "the average result over the angular distribution and , consequently , the total cross section is about the same in both calculations , however , in the forward - backward asymmetry our present calculation provides an even better description due to the small pv admixture . considering the dash - dotted lines , calculated using a large value for the @xmath107 coupling constant ,",
    "it becomes clear that such large values for the @xmath51 coupling and consequently for the @xmath11 coupling are ruled out by the experiment .",
    "our considerations show that towards a better understanding of the @xmath0 coupling precise measurements of the @xmath44 decay properties as well as a better knowledge on the @xmath135 coupling constant are needed .",
    "we arrive at the conclusion that both the pseudoscalar and pseudovector coupling constants of the @xmath2 meson to the nucleon seem to be exhausted by the effective @xmath101 triangular vertex .",
    "consequently , the meson cloud model predicts realistic results for reactions involving the coupling of the @xmath136 system to nucleons .",
    "to summarize , we wish to stress that in calculating the @xmath5 coupling it is necessary to account for the principal difference between the isosinglet and isotriplet axial vector currents of the nucleon on the quark level , a fact ignored by the quark model . for this reason the three flavor constituent quark model is unable to predict the correct size for @xmath21 .",
    "a similar situation is observed for the case of the @xmath137- and @xmath138-couplings which are concluded from photoproduction data on the nucleon to be about an order of magnitude smaller than the quark model predictions @xcite . the small value for @xmath139 is well understood in accounting for the principal difference between the strangeness preserving and strangeness changing axial vector currents of the nucleon on the quark level @xcite .        99 r. brockmann and r. machleidt , phys",
