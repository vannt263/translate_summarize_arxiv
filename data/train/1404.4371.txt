    "the dispersion in the molecular gas content is larger than in the , and the dependencies of molecular gas content ( co luminosity ) on hi , optical and sfr properties are discussed further in the following sections .",
    "optical morphology of the co - detected hi monsters can be roughly divided into three categories as noted in table  [ table_co ] : ( i ) a group with typical spiral arms ( e.g. agc005737 ) , ( ii ) a group showing tidal features ( e.g. agc192040 ) and lastly , ( iii ) a group with red colour or low surface brightness disk ( e.g. ugc006124 ) .",
    "one exception of the second class is agc09515 , which is distinct from the others in the same group by showing a number of small stellar complexes around it , indicating the accretion of dwarf satellites rather than a major merging event , which is not always expected to contain much molecular gas .",
    "most galaxies with red colour and/or not well - defined spiral structure ( e.g. pgc042102 ) are not detected in co.      in the previous section , we showed that the hi monsters are also among the most molecular gas massive systems for their given stellar mass and colour .",
    "this is also clearly seen on the left panel of figure  [ fig_mhimh2 ] , where hi and h@xmath82 masses of sample galaxies are compared .",

    "galaxies within a similar range of hi show at least an order of magnitude spread in their h@xmath13 content .",
    "few galaxies have molecular gas mass exceeding their atomic gas mass , and @xmath4 is almost always larger than @xmath6 by a factor of 2 - 3 on average . the broad correlation between atomic and molecular gas mass ( albeit with a significant scatter ) , as well as the general trend of a larger atomic gas fraction ( i.e. , @xmath83 ,",

    "the relation between atomic and molecular gas mass tightens when normalized by stellar mass , and a nearly linear trend emerges .",
    "this result indicates that a large atomic gas reservoir is a clear requirement to produce a large molecular disk in most cases .",

    "a comparison of molecular gas fraction versus star formation rate and specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) shows a much tighter correlation with the @xmath11-derived quantities ( e.g. , @xmath108 , compared with @xmath109 for the sdss ) .",
    "therefore , we limit our discussion to the @xmath11-derived star formation quantities from this point on .    molecular gas fraction and star formation rate sfr track each other broadly , as shown on the left panel of figure  [ fig_sfpro ] .",
    "galaxies with a higher sfr tend to have a larger fractional molecular gas content , and the  monsters are nearly indistinguishable from the comparison cold gass sample .",
    "the scatter among individual galaxies is still large for both samples ( @xmath110 for the  monsters , @xmath111 for the whole sample ) , but this correlation is clearly seen spanning all galaxies of different types and colours ( red galaxies to the bottom left and blue galaxies to the top right ) .",
    "specific star formation rate is even more tightly correlated with the molecular gas fraction ( see the right panel ) , having the smallest value of @xmath112 0.13 dex for the  monsters and @xmath112 0.25 dex for the entire sample .",
    "most hi monsters follow the same relation as the cold gass galaxies , although the systematic offset from the reference sample is visible again ( see below ) . a tighter correlation between @xmath85 and ssfr , rather than with sfr , is somewhat unexpected , but this appears to be a different realization of the linear scaling relationship between the amount of molecular gas and the amount of young stars that are forming within them .",
    "since specific star formation rate is by definition sfr normalized by @xmath91 , the correlation seen on the right panel of figure  [ fig_sfpro ] is the correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath113 , both normalized by @xmath91 to remove the distance dependence .",
    "this correlation shows the smallest dispersion among all comparisons of physical quantities we have examined for the  monsters and the cold gass sample , and this is likely the most fundamental relation that threads all types of galaxies represented in this study .",
    "the small systematic offset seen between the  monsters and the reference sample on the right panel of figure  [ fig_sfpro ] is surprising , given the tightness of the correlation ( @xmath114 ) . besides the  monsters ,",
    "several other cold gass galaxies are also offset from the main trend , in the manner that can be interpreted as having a sfr 2 - 3 times _ smaller _ for their given molecular gas mass . as discussed in ",
    "[ stellar mass and colour ] , this offset may largely reflect the sample selection of galaxies with the largest cold gas content . however , we already established no physical link between  content and sfr (   [ stellar mass density and conc ] ) , and a _ lower sfr for given molecular gas mass among the hi monsters _ requires a different explanation .",
    "cold gas content and consumption is only a quasi - static balance among gas accretion from the halo to the disk , star formation , recycling of the star - gas cycle , and feedback ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "small changes in the physical condition may swing this balance between @xmath115 and @xmath113 , for example , as seen among the  monsters , or the very condition that has led to the large  reservoir may simultaneously lead to the shift in the balance as observed . these are only conjectures at the moment , but this issue may deserve a further attention in future studies .",
    "one of the main motivations for conducting this study was testing whether a larger neutral atomic gas content (  reservoir \" ) automatically translates to a larger molecular gas mass and a higher sfr , as commonly formulated in cosmological simulations of galaxy growth and cold gas content evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this in turn means that the time scale for consuming their entire molecular gas reservoir at the current star formation rate should be longer for the hi monsters .    as seen on the left panel in figure  [ fig_ssftim ] , molecular gas depletion time ( @xmath116sfr )",

    "this general trend supports the idea that molecular hydrogen forms out of neutral atomic hydrogen , but the observed large scatter indicates that the situation is more complex .",
    "the molecular - to - atomic gas mass ratios for the  monsters are similar to those of the cold gass sample , which has the mean of @xmath143 @xcite but with a factor of @xmath144 scatter .",
    "this dispersion is significantly reduced when the two gas masses are normalized by their stellar mass .",
    "this analysis also shows that stellar @xmath81 colour is another major component leading to the spread in this relation .    by analyzing the gas and stellar properties of the  monsters and the cold gass sample together , we confirm the findings by @xcite that the @xmath81 colour is tightly correlated with molecular gas fraction ( @xmath54 ) while the other stellar properties are only weakly correlated at best .",
    "the global fractional molecular gas mass to that of atomic gas ( @xmath145 ) shows little correlation with stellar mass density @xmath92 when both samples are examined together , contrary to the tight correlation seen in spatially resolved distribution in nearby spiral disks @xcite .",
    "our detailed analysis shows that @xmath100 and @xmath92 are indeed tightly correlated , especially when the dependence on @xmath81 colour is also taken into account .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath99 and @xmath92 are completely uncorrelated on global scales .",
    "this disconnect between  and stellar component on global scales is not surprising since  disks typically extend far beyond their stellar counterparts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the apparent correlation between @xmath98 and @xmath92 among the  monsters reflects the underlying correlation between @xmath146 and @xmath92 because the  monsters have only a narrow range of @xmath4 .",
    "we found a broad correlation between molecular mass fraction ( @xmath85 ) and sfr among all galaxies , and the  monsters are indistinguishable from the cold gass sample in this trend .",
    "an even tighter correlation is seen between @xmath85 and ssfr  ( = sfr/@xmath91 ) , and we identify this tighter trend as that of the well - known near - linear correlation between @xmath6 and sfr . in this comparison",
    ", the  monsters stand out again with a systematically _ lower _ star formation efficiency .",
    "the cause for this curiously lower sf efficiency for the  monsters is unknown , and understanding this would require additional future work including the analysis of spatially resolved gas and star formation distributions .",
    "the gas depletion time exceeds the hubble time for many  monsters and cold gass sample galaxies , suggesting that the need for continuous gas accretion from the more extended hot halo may not be as critical as previously thought ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , at least for these late type galaxies containing significant amount of cold gas already .",
    "the total cold gas mass fraction shows a clear trend with stellar mass and colour , suggesting a strong link between star formation history and total gas content , similar to the scenario previously suggested by @xcite and others . in contrast , molecular gas mass fraction is nearly constant over the whole range of stellar mass and colour , indicating that the relevant time scales for the atomic and molecular gas are rather different and distinct .",
    "based on our analysis of atomic and molecular gas content among the  monsters and the cold gass sample , we offer a few cautions and suggestions for future modeling studies of cold gas content evolution .",
    "first and foremost , we find clear evidence for spatial and temporal disconnect between  and  ( and stars ) , and the modeling of these different phases of cold gas should be de - coupled , rather than linked together using a simple recipe . when modeling global star formation rate and gas content evolution using a numerical simulation with a coarse spatial and time resolution , a star formation recipe with a linear dependence on @xmath6 , as seen in our data , may be more effective than a more complex , non - linear recipe ( e.g. , `` schmidt - kennicutt law '' ) . in general , adopting empirically driven recipes supported by observational data may be more effective in modeling the observations , rather than implementing more physically motivated micro - physics that are modified to fit over the spatial and temporal resolution limits .",
    "we are grateful to mike brewer , don lydon , kamal souccar , gary wallace , ron grosslein , john wielgus , vern fath , and ronna erickson for their technical support of the redshift search receiver commissioning .",
    "we also thank martha haynes , riccardo giovanelli , and other members of the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey ( alfalfa ) team who contributed to the initial selection of the  monster sample from the early alfalfa catalog and jonathan t. yun for contributing to the compilation of the wise photometry from the nasa / ipac infrared science archive ( irsa ) .",
