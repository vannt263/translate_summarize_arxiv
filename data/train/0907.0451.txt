    "the 90 s witnessed a breakthrough in experimental techniques which led to a series of precision measurements of compton scattering  @xcite with the aim to determine the nucleon _ polarizabilities _",
    "@xcite .",
    "many theoretical approaches have been tried in the description of nucleon polarizabilities and low - energy compton scattering .",
    "the more prominent examples include dispersion relations @xcite , effective - lagrangian models  @xcite , constituent quark model  @xcite , and chiral - soliton type of models  @xcite",
    ". there has been as well a significant recent progress in approaching the subject from first principles ",
    "lattice qcd ( lqcd ) .",
    "the present lqcd studies are based on the external electromagnetic field method  @xcite , and even though the actual results for the nucleon have been obtained only in quenched approximation , the pion and kaon polarizabilities have been calculated with dynamical quarks  @xcite .",
    "the full - lqcd calculations for the nucleon will hopefully be done in a near future .    in this work",
    "we exploit another theoretical approach rooted in qcd , namely , chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath0pt )  @xcite .",
    "the very first @xmath0pt calculation of nucleon polarizabilities , published in 1991 by bernard , kaiser and meiner  @xcite , quotes the result shown in the @xmath9 column of table  . in the same column ,",
    "the numbers in brackets show the result of the so - called heavy - baryon ( hb ) expansion  @xcite . here",
    "it means that one additionally expands the full result  @xcite in powers of @xmath10 , the ratio of the pion and nucleon masses , and drops all but the leading terms ( cf .",
    "appendix a ) .",
    "the @xmath9 hb@xmath0pt result thus corresponds to the static nucleon approximation .",
    "the relativistic effects are systematically included in hb@xmath0pt at higher orders , but nonetheless even leading order hb@xmath0pt result is widely considered to be more consistent than the b@xmath0pt ( i.e. , fully relativistic ) one .",
    "the reason for that is that the full relativistic evaluation of the chiral loops may yield contributions which are of lower order than is given by the power - counting argument .",
    "this `` pathology '' , however , does not arise in the case of polarizabilities at @xmath9 , so as far as power counting is concerned , the b@xmath0pt result is as good here as the one of hb@xmath0pt .",
    "but even more generally , chiral symmetry ensures that the power - counting violating terms to be always accompanied by low - energy constants ( lecs ) , hence they can simply be removed in the course of renormalization of those lecs  @xcite . in simpler terms , there is no problem with power counting in b@xmath0pt .",
    "the present state - of - the - art @xmath0pt studies based on pion and nucleon degrees of freedom  @xcite utilize the hb expansion .",
    "they find , however , that despite the very reasonable values for polarizabilities , the @xmath9 and even @xmath11 results for the compton - scattering cross sections show significant discrepancy with experimental data starting from energies of about 120  mev , especially at backward kinematics .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath1(1232)-resonance as an explicit degree of freedom helps to remedy this discrepancy in the cross sections  @xcite .",
    "however , it comes at an expense of a large contribution to the polarizabilities @xcite .",
    "this @xmath1-contribution is highly unwanted in hb@xmath0pt , since polarizabilties come out nearly perfect already in the theory without the @xmath1 ( cf .  the numbers in brackets in table  ) .",
    "there is no natural solution to this problem .",
    "one is bound to either omit some of the @xmath1 contributions by  demoting \" them to higher orders  @xcite , or cancel them by  promoting \" some of the low - energy constants ( lecs ) to lower orders  @xcite .",
    "such an apparent failure of @xmath0pt is sometimes attributed to certain `` @xmath12-meson '' contributions  @xcite , which @xmath0pt misses . of course , while the @xmath13-meson of the linear sigma model is included in @xmath0pt , the contribution from the @xmath14(600 ) is not , but it is doubtful that the @xmath14 can explain it ; its two - photon coupling is too small .",
    "alternatively , studies based on dispersion relations suggest that some essentially relativistic effects , discarded in hb@xmath0pt as being higher order , are in fact important because of the proximity of cuts in both pion mass and energy  @xcite .    in our present study",
    "we verify the latter scenario and perform the calculations in a manifestly lorentz - covariant fashion , refraining from the use of the heavy - baryon formalism .",
    "the hb@xmath0pt results can then be recovered by simply expanding in powers of pion mass over the baryon mass , @xmath15 .",
    "we thus are coming back to the original ( relativistic quantum field theory ) ways  @xcite .",
    "the difference with the original work  @xcite is that we compute the compton scattering observables , not only the scalar polarizabilities , and that we include the @xmath16 in addition to the pion and nucleon degrees of freedom .",
    ".predictions of baryon @xmath0pt for electric ( @xmath17 ) and magnetic ( @xmath18 ) polarizabilities of the proton in units of @xmath19@xmath8 , compared with the particle data group summary of experimental values . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     inclusion of the @xmath1-isobar fields in a lorentz - covariant fashion raises the consistency problems of higher - spin field theory  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-isobar couplings used here possess the property of invariance under a gauge transformation : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is an arbitrary spinor field .",
    "this ensures the decoupling of unphysical spin-@xmath22 degrees of freedom and eliminates the consistency problems  @xcite .",
    "it is far less straightforward to reconcile this extra gauge symmetry with other symmetries of the chiral lagrangian . for recent progress",

    "v_k + 4l - 2n_-n_n . in the case of compton scattering by @xmath29",
    "we understand the photon energy or / and the pion mass as compared with @xmath30 gev .",
    "the graphs with @xmath1s are more tricky because for small @xmath29 they go as s_~ rather than simply @xmath31 as the nucleon propagators .",
    "the new scale = m_- m_n 293 is neither as light as @xmath32 nor as as heavy as @xmath33 , hence can and will be treated independently . for energies comparable to the pion mass",
    "we choose to additionally expand in @xmath34 , and hence the @xmath1 propagator counts as @xmath35 , while a graph with @xmath36 internal lines contributes to order p^n ( ) ^n_. for definiteness , when needed , we count @xmath37 to be of @xmath38 , i.e. , the  @xmath39 counting \" scheme @xcite .    for the power counting in the region where the energies are of order of @xmath40 ( the resonance region )",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "hereby we limit ourselves to the low - energy region , p~m_4f_.",
    "the chiral expansion for the compton amplitude begins with graph @xmath41 in and its crossed counterpart .",
    "nominally they both are of @xmath38 , however , together they simply give the thomson amplitude , which is of @xmath42 .",
    "we thus refer to @xmath42 as the leading order ( lo ) .",
    "the other graphs in contribute to @xmath9 , the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .    at nlo",
    "we also have the one - loop contributions shown in , but before evaluating them we make a redefinition of the nucleon field , @xmath43 , where = ( _ 5 ) .",

    "the two lagrangians are equivalent , in the sense of equivalence theorem , however , may have drastically different forms when expanded in the pion field . for the one - loop contributions to compton scattering",
    "it is sufficient to expand up to the second order in the pion field :    v_&= & ^a^abc ^b_^c+ ( ^3 ) , + a_&= & ^a_^a+ ( ^3 ) , + & = & 1 + ^a ^a _ 5 - ^2 + ( ^3 ) .",

    "- ^a^abc ^b^c ) n + ( ^3 ) .",
    "the major difference between the two forms is that the pseudovector @xmath48 coupling is transformed into a pseudoscalar one , while the weinberg ",
    "tomozawa @xmath49 term , which resembles a @xmath50-meson exchange , gets replaced by an isoscalar term akin to the remains of an integrated - out @xmath12-meson in the linear @xmath12 model .",
    "the isovector @xmath49 term , which is now proportional to @xmath51 , does not give any contribution to compton amplitude at one - loop level .    also , in the nlo loops , the photon couples only minimally , i.e. , to the electric charge of the pion and nucleon .",
    "now that the pion couples to the nucleon via pseudoscalar coupling , there is no kroll  ruderman ( @xmath52 ) term arising , and hence the number of one - loop graphs is reduced .",
    "the resulting expressions for amplitudes become simpler .    as a result ,",
    "the loop graphs shown in with couplings from the lagrangian transform to the graphs shown in with the couplings from .",
    "we have also checked explicitly that the two sets of one - loop diagrams give identical expressions for the compton amplitude .",
    "although the main purpose of the above field redefinition is to simplify the calculation , it does give more insight about the chiral dynamics .",
    "first of all , it explains how metz and drechsel  @xcite , calculating polarizabilities in the linear @xmath12 model with a heavy @xmath12-meson , obtain to one loop exactly the same result as b@xmath0pt at @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "secondly , observing that graphs ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) vanish in the forward kinematics , we can see that chiral symmetry plays less of a role in the forward compton scattering at order @xmath3",
    ".    going to @xmath53 we encounter the graphs with one @xmath54-isobar propagator shown in .",
    "the nucleon - field redefinition does not affect these contributions at this order .",
    "note that the graphs where photons couple minimally to @xmath1 contain more than one @xmath1 propagator and therefore should be suppressed by extra powers of @xmath34 . however , their lower - order contributions are important for electromagnetic gauge invariance and therefore for the renormalization program",
    ". in particular , the lower - order contributions of chiral loops should not affect the result of the low - energy theorem ( let )  @xcite , and this condition is automatically satisfied for a subclass of graphs which obeys gauge invariance .",
    "the loop graphs in form such a subclass for the case of neutral @xmath1 . in reality",
    "the @xmath54 comes in four charge states ( isospin @xmath55 ) , and hence a gauge invariant set will in addition have the higher - order graphs where photon couples minimally to the @xmath54 .",
    "to make the subclass of loop graphs in gauge invariant without the higher - order graphs , we used the following procedure :    * the one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) graphs , ( 1518 ) are computed with the correct isospin factors , i.e. , summing over all charge states of the @xmath54 .",
    "the isospin factors for the one - particle reducible ( 1pr ) graphs ( 1922 ) are chosen such that their ratio to the isospin factors of 1pi graphs is the same as in the neutral @xmath54 case .",
    "this procedure automatically ensures exact gauge invariance and thus effectively includes the lower - order contributions of the one - loop graphs with minimal coupling of photons to the @xmath54 . in case",
    "when the latter graphs are included explicitly , the isospin factors of 1pr graphs can be restored to actual values .",
    "this , however , will not affect the result at the order considered here .",
    "the graphs in and in were eventually computed by us with the help of the symbolic manipulation tool form @xcite and the looptools library  @xcite using dimensional regularization .      in accordance with",
    "the let  @xcite , the loop contributions shown in and in may contribute to the renormalization of nucleon mass , field , charge , and anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "we have adopted the on - mass - shell renormalization scheme , not the extended on - mass - shell renormalization ( eoms )  @xcite .",
    "the difference is that in eoms the above - listed quantities are taken to be at their chiral limit value while here we simply take the values at the actual pion mass , see , e.g. , table  .",
    "let us discuss first the contributions to nucleon self - energy and @xmath56 vertex corresponding to the nucleon loops ( 57 ) in .",
    "the corresponding amputated diagrams give contributions to nucleon self - energy ( 5 ) and to @xmath56 vertex ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) .",
    "more specifically , the contributions to the self - energy and the @xmath56 vertex can be written in the following form : @xmath57 where @xmath29 is the initial nucleon momentum , @xmath58 is the initial photon momentum , and @xmath59 .",
    "the function @xmath60 is finite and its expansion in powers of @xmath61 starts from a quadratic term .",
    "of all the functions @xmath62 that contribute to the @xmath56 vertex only @xmath63 is divergent .",
    "it contributes to the renormalization of charge .",
    "function @xmath64 contributes to a renormalization of the nucleon s anomalous magnetic moment . in this case",
    "the renormalization is finite @xcite .",
    "after the renormalization , the self - energy and the @xmath56 vertex can be written in the following form : @xmath65 where @xmath66 are subtracted functions .",
    "note that functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 do not get subtracted ; indeed , the lorentz structures that correspond to these functions are purely off - shell  they give zero when both nucleons are on - shell ( i.e. , when both @xmath29 and @xmath69 are on - shell momenta ) , so they do not contribute to the renormalization of charge or magnetic moment .",
    "however , both these functions play an important role in making the complete compton scattering amplitude gauge invariant .",
    "note also the fact that after the renormalization of nucleon mass , wave function , charge , and anomalous magnetic moment is performed , the remaining expressions for the nucleon loops ( 57 ) become finite .",
    "now we come to the loops with @xmath1 ,",
    ". the corresponding amputated loops also give contributions to nucleon self - energy and to @xmath56 vertex , and the corresponding expressions can be written in a full analogy to the case of nucleon loops .",
    "the loop ( 19 ) in also gives a contribution to @xmath56 , however , this contribution is fully off - shell and momentum - independent : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are constants . nevertheless , it is important to take this contribution into account in order to preserve the electromagnetic gauge invariance .",
    "the renormalization of nucleon self - energy and @xmath56 vertex proceeds for these loops in complete analogy to the purely nucleon loops .    in the case of @xmath1 loops , however , we obtain in addition some higher - order divergences , i.e. , ultraviolet divergences of @xmath73 .",
    "they are to be renormalized by a corresponding @xmath73 contact term . at this stage",
    "it is customary to use the @xmath74 subtraction of the higher - order divergences , see e.g. , ref .",
    "we have implemented the @xmath74 scheme for the higher - order divergences by putting the dimreg factor equal to zero ( see appendix a for more detail ) .",
    "the dispersion relations enjoy a special role in nucleon compton scattering , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "first of all , practically all up - to - date empirical values of nucleon polarizabilities are extracted from data with the use of a model based on dispersion relations  @xcite .",
    "secondly , in the forward kinematics , the compton amplitude can be related to an integral over energy of the photoabsorption cross section , which in combination with the low - energy expansion yields a number of model - independent sum rules .",
    "a famous example is the baldin sum rule : + = ^_0 d , where the sum of polarizabilities is related to an integral of the total photoabsorption cross section @xmath75 over the photon lab - frame energy @xmath76 .    in general",
    ", the forward compton - scattering amplitude can be decomposed into two scalar functions of a single variable in the following way : t_fi()=^f ( ) + i(^)g ( ) , where @xmath77 are the polarization vectors of the initial and final photons , respectively , and @xmath78 are the pauli spin matrices .",
    "the functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 are even functions of @xmath76 . using analyticity and the optical theorem , one can write down the following sum rules :    f ( ) & = & f(0)+^_0 d^ , + g ( ) & = & ^_0 d^^ ,    where @xmath81 is the thomson amplitude and @xmath12 is the doubly polarized photoabsorption cross section , with the index indicating the helicity of the initial photon  nucleon state ; @xmath82 .",
    "these sum rules should also hold for the individual contributions of the loop graphs in . in this case",
    "the photoabsorption process is given by the born graphs of single - pion photoproduction , for which analytic expressions exist  @xcite : _",

    "it is interesting to note that the leading - order pion photoproduction amplitude , which enters on the right - hand side of , is independent of whether one uses pseudovector or pseudoscalar @xmath48 coupling  @xcite .",
    "it essentially means that chiral symmetry of the effective lagrangian plays no role at this order .",
    "the latter statement can , by means of the sum rule , be extended to the forward compton amplitude at @xmath9 . on the other hand , the graphs @xmath88 and @xmath89 in ,",
    "being the only ones beyond the pseudoscalar theory , take the sole role of chiral symmetry . in",
    "the forward kinematics these graphs indeed vanish but play an important role in the backward angles . without them the values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 would be entirely different",
    ". the value of @xmath90 would of course be the same , but @xmath91 would ( approximately ) flip sign .",
    "furthermore , in the chiral limit , the value of @xmath91 would diverge as @xmath92 ( instead of @xmath93 as it should ) .",
    "we thus arrive at the conclusion that chiral symmetry of the effective lagrangian plays a more prominent role in backward compton scattering .      in the previous publication  @xcite we simply adopted the error estimate from ref .",
    "however , in this work we compute to one order higher than in ref .",
    "@xcite and hence the error analysis needs to be revised accordingly .",
    "an error of an effective - field theory calculation is an estimate of higher - order effects assuming their natural size .",
    "the higher - order effects not included in our calculation begin at @xmath11 , i.e. , the order at which the polarizability lecs , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , arise .",
    "the naturalness assumption requires these constants to be of order of unity in the units of the chiral symmetry breaking scale of a gev . to be more specific",
    "we assume the absolute value of these constants ( in the @xmath96 scheme ) is limited by _",
    "( err.)=_(err.)=(e^2/4)/m_n^3 0.7 10 ^ -4 ^ 3 , this number gives a natural estimate of the error on polarizability values we have obtained at nnlo .",
    "it is not difficult to find how this error propagates to observables , once the effect of the lecs on those observables is known .",
    "for example , for the unpolarized differential cross section , the error is given by [ cf .",
    "] : = 8 ( e^2/4 )  ^1/2 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) the laboratory energy of the incident ( scattered ) photon , and = \\ {    lc & , + ( ) ^2 & .    .",
    "let us emphasize that we do not include the errors due to the uncertainty in the values of parameters in table   or due to the @xmath100 effects which stem from graphs with two @xmath54 propagators .",
    "our errors are thus underestimated , however , they can directly serve as an indicator of sensitivity to the polarizability lecs at @xmath11 .",
    "the chiral - loop contribution to scalar polarizabilities of the proton which arise from the nnlo calculation of the compton amplitude is given in the appendix a. in addition , we have the tree - level @xmath54(1232 ) contribution from graphs ( 14 ) in and its crossed , given by  @xcite : @xmath101 here and in what follows the numerical values are given in the units of @xmath19@xmath8 .",
    "the numerical composition of the full result thus looks as follows : @xmath102 as explained earlier , a natural estimate of @xmath11 contributions yields an uncertainty of at least @xmath103 on these values . in this result , shown by the red blob ,",
    "is compared with the empirical information , and with the @xmath54-less @xmath11 hb@xmath0pt result of beane et  al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we can clearly see a few - sigma discrepancy of our result with the taps - mami determination of polarizabilities  @xcite . on the other hand , as shown in the next section , our result agrees with taps data for the compton differential cross sections .",
    "of course we compare with the data at the lower energy end ( below the pion threshold ) where polarizabilities play the prominent role .",
    "the extraction of the polarizabilities in ref .",
    "@xcite has also been influenced by data above the @xmath54-resonance region to which we can not compare . clearly",
    "an extraction of scalar polarizabilities based on the data of 400 mev and higher could be affected by uncontrolled model dependencies and needs to be avoided .",
    "excluding the higher - energy data from the taps analysis could help to resolve the apparent discrepancy between theory and experiment in .    in",
    "we show the pion mass dependence of proton polarizabilities in both b@xmath0pt and hb@xmath0pt .",
    "the difference between the two for the magnetic polarizability ( lower panel ) at @xmath9 is stunning ( compare the blue dashed and violet dotted curves ) .",
    "the region of applicability of the hb expansion is apparently limited here to essentially the chiral limit , @xmath104 . for any finite pion mass , the b@xmath0pt and hb@xmath0pt results come out to be of a similar magnitude but of the opposite sign . a similar picture is observed for the @xmath105 loops arising at @xmath53 .",
    "in fact , we have checked that in the limit of vanishing @xmath54-nucleon mass splitting ( @xmath106 ) , the considered @xmath107 and @xmath105 loops give ( up to the spin ",
    "isospin factors ) the same result .",
    "the total effect of the delta here is the difference between the @xmath9 and the @xmath53 curves in b@xmath0pt and the difference between the @xmath9 and the @xmath108 curves in hb@xmath0pt .",
    "note that here the @xmath108 contribution in hb@xmath0pt with @xmath54(1232 ) precisely corresponds to @xmath53 of b@xmath0pt , thus we do not include the @xmath11 lecs in neither of the calculations .",
    "the actual @xmath108 calculations @xcite are supplemented with the @xmath11 lecs , whose main role is then to cancel the large contribution of the @xmath54-isobar .",
    "in this section we present the results for the differential cross sections of proton compton scattering .",
    "= 10.5 cm    = 5.6 cm    in , we consider the unpolarized differential cross section of the @xmath109 process as a function of the scattering angle in center - of - mass system , at fixed incident photon energy . in , we study the same cross section , but as a function of the energy for fixed scattering angle in the lab frame .",
    "our complete nnlo result is shown by red solid curves with band indicating the theory error estimate given in .",
    "the agreement between the theory and the experiment is quite remarkable here , especially given the fact that the theory result here is a prediction in the sense that has no free parameters . despite this good agreement ,",
    "as already noted above , there is a few - sigma discrepancy in the polarizability values between this theoretical prediction and the most precise empirical extraction  @xcite .",
    "this is apparently because the data at higher energies used additionally in the empirical extraction play an important role in the determination of @xmath110 .",
    "it is always interesting to study the convergence of the chiral expansion . in these figures",
    "the leading - order , @xmath42 , result is shown by dotted curve , which is nothing else than the klein  nishina cross section ( i.e , compton scattering off a classical pointlike particle with the charge and mass of the proton ) .",
    "the nlo , @xmath9 , result is given by the blue dash - dotted curve .",
    "one can see that the size of the effects varies strongly with the scattering angle . at energies below the pion - production threshold ,",
    "the nlo effects are tiny at backward angles but play a crucial role at forward angles .",
    "the situation is quite the opposite for the nnlo @xmath54-isobar contributions .",
    "nevertheless , the convergence of this expansion seems to be satisfactory and in any case is much better than it would be in analogous hb@xmath0pt calculations .    for completeness the result for the born contribution , given by the powell cross section together with the wzw anomaly contribution ( graphs in ) ,",
    "is shown here by the green dashed curves . any deviation from these curves at low energies",
    "is attributed to polarizability effects .",
    "more specifically , - ^ ( ) = - 8 ( e^2/4 ) ",
    "+ ( ^3 ) , where @xmath111 is defined in and @xmath112 is the cosine of the lab - frame scattering angle .",
    "the difference between the dashed ( born ) curves and the dotted ( klein  nishina ) curves arises mainly due to proton s anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "the difference is substantial but at backward angles can be seen to cancel almost entirely against the chiral loop contribution at @xmath9 , to obtain the blue curves .",
    "thus , at @xmath9 , there is an intricate cancellation between the anomalous magnetic moment and the chiral loop effects .",
    "it would be interesting to see if this cancellation persists at higher orders .      in we show the results for compton - scattering differential cross sections obtained with linearly polarized beam .",
    "the subscript @xmath86 ( @xmath113 ) indicates that the beam polarization is parallel ( perpendicular ) to the scattering plane , @xmath114 is the scattering angle in the lab frame and @xmath115 .",
    "the two particular combinations of polarized cross sections , seen in the upper and the lower panels , are chosen such that each of them is sensitive to only one of the polarizabilities .",
    "they are therefore selected for the forthcoming measurement of proton polarizabilities at the higs facility  @xcite .",
    "the higs measurements are planned to be taken at 110 mev photon lab energy , where a low - energy expansion ( lex ) is assumed to hold . indeed",
    "a study of the unpolarized differential cross section indicates that lex can be trusted to energies of about 100 mev @xcite .",
    "here we make a similar study for the polarized cross sections .",
    "the lex states that at the second order the deviation of the polarized cross sections from the corresponding born result ( dashed lines in the figure ) is simply given in terms of the polarizabilities :    - ^ ( ) & = & - 8 ( e^2/4 )  ( + ) + ( ^3 ) + - ^ ( ) & = & - 8 ( e^2/4 )  ( + ) + ( ^3 ) ,    where @xmath111 is defined in .",
    "a derivation of these expressions is given in appendix b.    from one can indeed see that , at this order in lex , the difference of the polarized cross sections , @xmath116 , is proportional to @xmath117 , while the combination @xmath118 is proportional to @xmath110 .",
    "one should realize , though , that this is only an approximate result which breaks down at sufficiently high energies .",
    "the attempts to address this issue in a quantitative way by comparing the second - order lex ( long - dashed curves ) with the result of nnlo b@xmath0pt ( red solid curves with the error band ) .",
    "the lex and b@xmath0pt results have exactly the same values for the polarizabilities @xmath17 and @xmath18 , but the validity of b@xmath0pt extends over the whole considered energy range .    we conclude that a determination at 110 mev based on a second - order lex can be reliable for @xmath117 , see the upper panels .",
    "the situation is not as fortunate for the observable aimed at the determination of @xmath110 , see the lower panels .",
    "the lex result begins to fail here at lower energies , at least in the backward angles where compton experiments are usually simpler .",
    "we have completed a next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) calculation of low - energy compton scattering on the proton within the @xmath0pt framework .",
    "more specifically , we have computed all the effects of order @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath119 , with @xmath40 being the excitation energy of the @xmath16 resonance .",
    "these are all _ predictive _ powers in the sense that no unknown low - energy constants ( lecs ) enter until at least one order higher [ i.e. , @xmath11 ] .",
    "this fact together with the availability of precise data for compton scattering has given us a unique opportunity to put @xmath0pt to a test .",
    "we have found that , assuming a natural size of the @xmath11 lecs , the theoretical uncertainty of the nnlo calculation is comparable with the uncertainty of present empirical information about the cross sections of proton compton scattering and the corresponding values for isoscalar polarizabilities of the proton . within these uncertainties the nnlo result agrees with the cross sections data below the pion threshold but shows a three - sigma discrepancy in the value for the magnetic polarizability .",
    "we note that the state - of - the - art empirical value for the polarizabilities was extracted by using not just the low - energy data but also data above the @xmath54-resonance region",
    ". the planned experiments at higs could be very helpful in sorting out this issue , since they plan to use precision low - energy data only . in this case , however , the reliance on the strict second - order low - energy expansion might be a problem , as our calculation has shown . the @xmath0pt framework itself could provide a more reliable energy interpolation needed for the extraction of polarizabilities .    in this work we have insisted on the fact that _ chiral power counting _ should be done for _ graphs _ , not _",
    "contributions_. it does not put any constraint on how many powers of pion mass or energy may appear in the result .",
    "it puts the constraint on the leading power only .",
    "the heavy - baryon expansion is therefore not mandatory for correct power - counting .",
    "what is important is that no powers lower than given by power - counting are present in the result .",
    "the manifestly covariant baryon @xmath0pt ( b@xmath0pt ) conforms to this requirement , because even if the lower - order terms appear in calculation of a given graph , they are shown to contribute only to a renormalization of the lecs . in our example",
    ", the low - energy theorem and chiral symmetry ensured that all such troublesome terms contributed only to the renormalization of nucleon mass , charge , and the anomalous magnetic moment .",
