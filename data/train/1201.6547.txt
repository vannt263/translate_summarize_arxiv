    "the large hadron collider [ lhc ] at cern in geneva , switzerland is the world s highest energy accelerator designed to study the physics relevant for the origin of mass .",
    "according to the theory called the standard model [ sm ] which describes , with few exceptions , most of the observable phenomena in the universe , the higgs field is responsible for the masses of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bosons , as well as that of quarks and leptons .",
    "experiments , published so far , now only allow for the higgs mass to be in the range between 115 and 127 gev @xcite .",
    "the two humongous multi - purpose detectors , cms and atlas , at cern have recently presented hints towards the discovery of the elusive higgs boson @xcite .",
    "details concerning its exact mass and branching ratios will tell us whether we are dealing with the higgs boson of the sm , or whether physics beyond the sm is required . at the moment all these possibilities are still open .",
    "supersymmetry is a mild extension of the sm . in its simplest form , the minimal supersymmetric standard model [ mssm ]",
    ", it favors a rather light cp - even higgs boson with mass below 130 gev @xcite and properties very similar to those of the sm higgs boson .",
    "there are however two serious problems of the mssm .",
    "these are known as the @xmath0 and strong cp problems . the @xmath0 term",
    "( @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the higgs doublet superfields of the mssm ) gives mass to the higgs doublets of order @xmath0 .",
    "the problem is that this term breaks no low energy symmetry and is thus naturally of order the @xmath10 scale , but it needs to be at the weak scale .",
    "the strong cp problem is a problem of qcd .",
    "one popular solution requires the existence of a light pseudo - scalar particle , known as the axion .    in order to address these problems simple extensions of the mssm",
    "have been proposed .",
    "the simplest ( singlet ) extension of the mssm is the nmssm @xcite , motivated by questions of electroweak symmetry breakdown , the @xmath0-problem and an increase of the upper limit on mass of the lightest higgs boson @xcite .",
    "properties of the higgs system might change drastically and could be checked by lhc experiments @xcite . a relation between the @xmath0 problem and the ( invisible ) axion solution @xcite to the strong cp - problem",
    "have been noticed in a particular singlet extension @xcite of the mssm .    in this letter",
    "we shall discuss a simple generalization @xcite of this scheme ( which we denote by @xmath11mssm ) with additional light supermultiplets , one of which ( @xmath1 ) is protected by the original peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "the pq symmetry forbids the renormalizable terms , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the coefficients of these can be generated by breaking the pq symmetry at a high energy scale .",
    "in particular , we note that the coefficients of @xmath1 and @xmath14 are not the pq symmetry breaking scale , in contrast to most pq symmetry models where they are generically of order the pq symmetry breaking scale .",
    "the @xmath0 term can be generated by a nonrenormalizable term , which is the one used in the mssm . with the singlet",
    "@xmath1 surviving down to the tev scale , there is an important renormalizable term @xmath2 which distinguishes the phenomenology of @xmath11mssm   from that of the mssm .",
    "the main result of this letter is the observation that such a model predicts the existence of a light pseudoscalar ( cp - odd ) higgs boson that could be within reach of the current lhc experiments . in the limit @xmath15",
    ", we find that there exists a chiral symmetry which is nontrivial only for @xmath16 and @xmath1 .",
    "it may be called ` higgsino symmetry ' .",
    "because of its pseudoscalar nature , such an ( axion - like ) particle @xmath3 will predominantly decay to two photons , @xmath17 , and could be easily distinguished from the cp - even higgs boson .",
    "to set up a first version of the model we consider a set - up as given in @xcite .",
    "later we shall simplify the model and restrict to the fields that are relevant for the physics at the electroweak scale . to break the pq symmetry and susy",
    ", we generalize the polonyi type superpotential to break the pq symmetry and parametrize the susy breakdown .",
    "we introduce the following renormalizable superpotential with the pq symmetry and the u(1)@xmath18 symmetry shown in table [ table : pqcharge ] , @xmath19 where @xmath20 are constants . here , we need @xmath21 , but the rest is at the electroweak scale , _ i.e. _  @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    ".the pq and @xmath26 charges of @xmath27 and @xmath28 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from eq .",
    "( [ eq : cpoddmass ] ) , we note that the @xmath3 mass is small for a small @xmath0 . however , the @xmath29 dependence is not singular for @xmath30 because the numerator cancels this divergence . in fig . [",
    "fig : masscpodd ] , the mass of @xmath3 is shown in the @xmath31 plane for @xmath32 and 200gev , respectively , and @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in this parameter range ,",
    "the lightest eigenvalue of @xmath36 is @xmath1-like . as in the axion - photon - photon coupling case , in general there",
    "exists an @xmath3-photon - photon coupling as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : triangle ] . since the diagram occurs through the higgsino line only , the anomaly coupling estimation is simple to give @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the electromagnetic field strength and @xmath39 is its dual .",
    "we note that the coupling is not suppressed by the axion decay constant @xmath40 but by the vev of @xmath1 .",
    "is the axion - photon - photon coupling .",
    "the chiral current of the charged higgsino , @xmath41 , has the divergence @xmath42 which gives eq .",
    "( [ eq : xanomaly ] ) . ]",
    "similar anomaly couplings to @xmath43 and @xmath44 are present with couplings proportional to @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "but , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are not present .",
    "therefore , the production and decay of @xmath3 occur with the electroweak scale . through the anomalous coupling ( [ eq : xanomaly ] ) , the electron - positron collider lep ii ( with @xmath49 ) could have produced three photon events ( through @xmath50 ) for @xmath51 pseudoscalar at a @xmath52 pb level ,    @xmath53 which gives only @xmath54 event for the integrated luminosity of lep ii @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : xanomaly ] ) , the decay width is given by @xmath55 since the lhc lower bound of the higgsino mass is above 200 gev @xcite , the @xmath3 decay to two photons for its mass of order 125 gev with the insertions of @xmath56 and @xmath57 is negligible compared to eq .",
    "( [ eq : axtotwoph ] ) . for @xmath58 , the decay",
    "@xmath59 introduces a suppression factor @xmath60 .",
    "a similar remark applies to the @xmath61 coupling . on the other hand",
    ", some superpartner fermion can be lighter than @xmath3 .    for the @xmath1-like @xmath3",
    ", therefore , decays to the @xmath62 and a pair of lightest neutralino modes account for almost 100 % .",
    "if so , some two photon events with strong dijets in the forward direction , which is the characteristic of vector boson fusion , may come from @xmath3 production and decay , showing a two - photon resonance peak at the @xmath3 mass different from @xmath51 .",
    "such event rate is too small to be observed at the lhc , since the ratio of the @xmath3 production to that of the mssm higgs boson @xmath63 is naively estimated by the ratio of couplings , @xmath64 @xcite .    even though the lightest eigenvalue of @xmath36 is @xmath1-like , a small fraction of the higgs component makes @xmath3 decay to @xmath65 at tree level .",
    "the ratio of brs to @xmath4 and to @xmath66 in our example is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68\\cos\\gamma $ ] with @xmath69 $ ] in a large @xmath70 limit , and @xmath71 is multiplied for three colors of @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath26 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratiotob ] ) is about @xmath73 . in a large @xmath70 and a small @xmath0 limits , @xmath74 which is very small .",
    "note in addition that the absolute production rate through eq .",
    "( [ eq : axtotwoph ] ) is relevant at this stage as far as the @xmath75 mode is swamped by the sm background . if the production through the initial @xmath76 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eepseudo ] ) is estimated for @xmath77 luminocity of the 7tev lhc , we expect roughly @xmath78 event .",
    "experiments at the lhc will soon test the properties of the sm higgs boson @xcite .",
    "masses and decay properties of the higgs system will be crucial for the analysis of potential physics beyond the standard model . in this work",
    "we have considered a specific scheme motivated by supersymmetry and the strong cp - problem that predicts a pseudoscalar particle with decay @xmath79 , that might well be within reach of current lhc experiments .      *",
