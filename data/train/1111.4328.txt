    "the nn interaction provides a basic building block of atomic nuclei .",
    "a milestone in the development of the field was achieved when the nijmegen group generated a fit via a partial wave analysis ( pwa ) to a set of about 4000 nn scattering data with @xmath1  @xcite after charge dependence ( cd ) effects were incorporated and discarding about further 1000 of @xmath2 inconsistent data .",
    "the analysis was carried out using an energy dependent potential for which nuclear structure calculations become hard to formulate .",
    "thus , energy independent _ high quality _ potentials were produced with almost identical @xmath3  @xcite . among them , the av18 potential is directly useful for _ ab initio _ monte carlo calculations up to @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "while all these potentials differ in their form , in the last years it has been realized that if cm momenta above @xmath5 are explicitly integrated out , the remaining effective interaction has appealing features .",
    "the so - called @xmath0 potentials  @xcite exhibit an astonishing degree of universality , produce a rather smooth interaction and weaken the strength of the interaction so that hartree - fock calculations may be reliable starting points for nuclear structure calculations . in the present talk we adress a suitable formulation of the problem in configuration space .",
    "regarless of these successes it is to date unclear what is the impact of nn uncertainties on finite nuclei due to our ignorance on short distances .",
    "relevant length scales are a ) the mean interparticle separation distance @xmath6 as obtained from nuclear matter saturation density @xmath7 , b ) the fermi momentum @xmath8 which gives a wavelength of about @xmath9 , c ) minimal relative cm de broglie wavelengh corresponding to the pion production threshold @xmath10 and d ) the pion compton wavelength @xmath11 .",
    "the situation is presented pictorially in fig .",
    "[ fig : nucleus ] suggesting that for the description of the ground state in light nuclei both the short distance core and the role of explicit pions become marginal .",
    "this was recognized long ago  @xcite where the bulk of @xmath12 and @xmath13 could be described with a pionless and soft - core potential which just reproduced the s - wave phase shifts up to @xmath14 .",
    "actually , we expect this feature to hold for light nuclei .",
    "the basic observation was made long ago by aviles  @xcite and recently rediscovered in the context of renormalization of chiral forces  @xcite .",
    "if the two - particle cm wave numbers are limited to a range @xmath15 only gross information can be determined in an interval @xmath16 , ( see e.g. fig .  [",
    "fig : nucleus ] ) with @xmath17 .",
    "thus , for @xmath18 we have @xmath19 .",
    "this uncertainty suggests that for a limited energy range the potential only needs to be known in a limited number of points . with this in mind",
    "we consider a neutron - proton ( np ) potential as a sum of @xmath20 functions @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the reduced np mass of the system , the @xmath23 coefficients are strength parameters and @xmath24 are the concentration radii . in that case",
    "we may determine the s - wave as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the accumulated phase shift at the mid - point @xmath27 and @xmath28 . matching the discontinuity of log - derivatives at @xmath29 , we simply get @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the reduced potential",
    ". the regular solution at the origin requires @xmath32 .",
    "if we take the limit @xmath33 we can define @xmath34 , to get @xmath35 which is the variable phase equation  @xcite up to finite grid corrections and can be interpreted as the change in the accumulated phase when a truncated potential of the parametric form @xmath36 is steadily switched on as a function of the variable @xmath37 .",
    "this equation and its generalization to coupled channels has extensively been used to treat the renormalization problem in nn scattering in refs .",
    "the low energy expansion of the discrete variable phase equations was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to determine threshold parameters in all partial waves .",
    "the relation to the well - known nyquist theorem of sampling a signal with a given bandwidth has been discussed in ref .",
    "of course , this ds approximation to the potential can be most immediately used as a numerical method to solve the scattering problem , which would become exact for @xmath38 , if we take the weights _ given _ by the potential @xmath39 . as an illustration",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ delta - shell ] the phase - shifts obtained for the @xmath40-av18 potential for several values of @xmath16 .",
    "convergence to the phases to four significant figures is achieved for @xmath41 .",
    "the equidistant discretization corresponds to the trapezoidal rule and one could improve by a more sophisticated method , a relevant issue when the interaction is known _ a priori_.",
    "another , more fruitful and economical , perspective already pursued by aviles corresponds to consider the weights themselves , @xmath23 , as fitting parameters to the phase - shifts , since anyhow the potential at short distances is unknown and will be determined from the data .",
    "if we take just one delta - shell in s - wave we may determine both the point @xmath42 and its corresponding strength , @xmath43 from the scattering length @xmath44 and the effective range @xmath45 , defined from @xmath46 for instance , for the @xmath40 case one has @xmath47 and @xmath48 which yields @xmath49 and @xmath50 whereas for the @xmath51 channel one gets @xmath52 and @xmath53 giving @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the corresponding phase shifts are reproduced to about @xmath56 .",
    "one can improve on this by including more delta - shells .",
    "a good fit to the pwa is obtained for ( @xmath23 in @xmath57 and @xmath24 in @xmath58 ) @xmath59 this shows that one can consider the grid points as well as the weights as fitting parameters .",

    "of course , the existence of finite experimental errors helps in decreasing the number of coarse grained grid points .",
    "we have carried out preliminary fits to the nn database  @xcite with a pion tail with an average @xmath61 starting at @xmath62 for partial waves with @xmath63 and about 40 parameters with @xmath64 .",

    "we have shown how sampling of the nn interaction by a delta shell potential with a resolution determined by the debroglie wavelength of the most energetic particle provides a coarse graining in configuration space , analogous to the @xmath88 approach .",
    "however , rather than transforming a high quality potential we suggest to determine the nn coarse grained interaction directly from the scattering data .",
    "a preliminary fit to the np phase shifts in the nijmegen data base to all partial waves with @xmath89 requires about 40 fitting parameters yielding @xmath90 ( less than 1 in some waves ) .",
