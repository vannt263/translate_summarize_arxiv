    "the characterization of strongly interacting topological states is quite different from that of the weakly interacting counterparts  @xcite . due to the existence of strong correlations among particles , it is very hard to define a topological invariant and to clarify the interplay between topological features and inter - particle interactions .",
    "the study of magnons in quantum spin models can provide fundamental insights into collective excitations and low - energy properties of magnetism .",
    "the quantum heisenberg chain is one of the foundational models of interacting quantum spins .",
    "the basic collective excitations around the ground state of ferromagnetic heisenberg chain appear as quasiparticle excitations , the so called magnons  @xcite . due to the ferromagnetic interaction , in addition to continuous scattering states , magnon",
    "bound states appear when the interaction is strong enough  @xcite .",
    "recently , magnon excitations and their bound - states have been observed in the quantum heisenberg chains comprising bosonic atoms in optical lattices  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we pursue a new direction to explore the topological magnon bound - states which have never been reported before . in last years",
    ", the topological feature of single - magnon excitations has been studied in both theory and experiment  @xcite . beyond the scenario for single - magnon topological excitations",
    ", it is of great challenge to clarify whether topological bound - states may emerge in a strongly interacting multi - magnon system .",
    "one outstanding challenge is the absence of a well - defined topological invariant for an interacting multi - particle system .",
    "fortunately , we find that this problem can be solved when the system has the _ cotranslational symmetry _ : the invariance under collective multi - particle translation .",
    "we demonstrate that the cotranslational symmetry naturally allows us to formulate a topological invariant , which can be used to characterize the topological feature of multi - magnon excitations .    in comparison with other topological invariants for strongly interacting multi - particle systems ,",
    "our topological invariant is intrinsic and straightforward .",
    "the conventional thouless - kohmoto - nightingale - den nijs invariant  @xcite has been extensively used to characterize noninteracting systems . a well - known generalization to interacting systems",
    "is by introducing the twisted boundary condition  @xcite , which requires to calculate all many - body ground - states for a continuous @xmath0-period of the twist angle .",
    "another topological invariant for interacting systems is given in terms of the green s function  @xcite , which requires to calculate the green s function at all frequencies .",
    "recently , a topological invariant only involving the green s function at zero frequency has been proposed  @xcite . instead of the introduced twist angle ,",
    "our topological invariant is directly defined by using the physical center - of - mass ( c.o.m ) quasi - momentum associated with the cotranslational symmetry .",
    "our definition opens a new route to characterizing topological features of strongly interacting multi - particle systems .    through analyzing the defined topological invariant",
    ", we explore the existence of topological bound - states of magnons in an interacting quantum heisenberg chain under the cotranslational symmetry . to clarify the physical origin of topological bound - states , we derive an effective model for the two - magnon bound - states by employing the degenerated many - body perturbation theory .",
    "furthermore , our two - magnon results could be straightforwardly generalized to multi - magnon excitations . based upon current available experimental techniques , it is possible to examine our predictions via quantum spin chains of ultracold atoms  @xcite or ions  @xcite .",
    "we consider a quantum heisenberg chain described by the following hamiltonian , @xmath1 \\nonumber \\\\    & & + \\sum_{l}b_l\\hat{s}_l^z+b_0\\sum_{l}\\hat{s}_l^z,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the spin-@xmath2 operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the @xmath5-th lattice site . for simplicity",
    ", we use the units of the reduced planck constant @xmath6 . here ,",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are the transverse and longitudinal spin - exchange couplings , respectively .",

    "similar to the modulated single - particle systems  @xcite , the periodic parameter @xmath12 may act as an additional dimension for constructing the torus and defining the topological invariant",
    ". however , differently , the single - particle quasi - momenta for interacting multi - particle systems are no longer good quantum numbers .",
    "this difference imposes a great challenge to define topological invariants for interacting multi - particle systems .    for convenience ,",
    "we concentrate on studying magnon excitations over the fully magnetized state @xmath16 with all spins pointing downwards . for a positive and sufficiently large @xmath9 , the ground state is the fully magnetized state @xmath16 .",
    "the excited states over @xmath16 can be obtained by flipping spins . regarding the ground state as a vacuum state",
    ", the excited states can be viewed as a gas of quasi - particles called magnons .",
    "thus the transverse and longitudinal spin - exchange couplings respectively represent the hopping and interaction between magnons , and the magnetic fields @xmath17 describe the on - site energy of magnons .",
    "since the hamiltonian   respects the @xmath18 symmetry under rotation transformations @xmath19 , the total spin along @xmath20-direction @xmath21 is conserved .",
    "therefore , the total magnon number ( the number of spins that point upwards ) @xmath22 is also conserved , where @xmath23 is the magnon number for the @xmath5-th lattice site .",
    "the quantum heisenberg chain   actually respects a cotranslational symmetry associated with the cotranslational operator . under periodic boundary condition ( bc ) , the c.o.m quasi - momentum associated with the cotranslational operator is a good quantum number .",
    "based on the above c.o.m quasi - momentum and the periodic parameter of the modulation field , we successfully construct an artificial torus and then define a chern topological invariant .    to define the cotranslational symmetry",

    "we call this abelian group as the cotranslation group . since @xmath40",
    ", one can easily demonstrate that @xmath41 holds for an arbitrary @xmath24-magnon wavefunction @xmath42 .",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath44 and the cotranslational operator @xmath33 have common eigenstates . the common eigenstates obey @xmath45 where @xmath46 are eigenvalues of @xmath33 .",

    ", we have @xmath53 which resembles the bloch theorem for single - particle systems with translational symmetry .",
    "therefore , @xmath50 is the eigenvalue of the generator for the cotranslation group and functions as the corresponding c.o.m quasi - momentum . by defining @xmath54 , from eq .  , we find that @xmath55 is invariant under the cotranslation group , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "this means that @xmath42 resembles the bloch function .    based upon the cotranslational symmetry and the corresponding c.o.m quasi - momentum ,",
    "we now show how to formulate the topological invariant for our interacting multi - magnon system .",
    "it is important to note that the periodic parameter @xmath12 has been introduced in the modulation field .",
    "therefore , through combining the periodic parameter @xmath12 with the c.o.m quasi - momentum @xmath50 , one can construct an artificial torus in the two - dimensional momentum space , where @xmath12 acts as the quasi - momentum in the second dimension  @xcite .",
    "based on this artificial torus , similar to a realistic two - dimensional periodic system  @xcite , we can define the chern number as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the berry curvature of the @xmath59-th band , with @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
