    "the non - classical nature of quantum states is considered to be an essential resource for the emerging quantum technologies .",

    "the study of measurement resources is motivated also from a fundamental point of view . as shown in @xcite there",

    "the existence of such a classical description is equivalent to joint measurability of suitable observables . in particular",
    ", it has been recently shown that for the chsh - bell inequality @xcite and epr - steering scenarios @xcite , the appropriate quantum resource can be formulated in terms of _ incompatibility _ of the available local observables .",
    "it is therefore important to aim for a better understanding of the incompatibility of observables .",
    "since every real quantum system interacts with its environment @xcite , a practical implementation of any quantum protocol has to take the possible effects of noise into account .",
    "the dynamical behaviour of nonclassical features of quantum states has been extensively studied in recent years . specifically , understanding dynamical phenomena such as entanglement sudden death @xcite , or frozen discord",
    "@xcite has been useful for determining the level of isolation from the environment required to implement protocols relying on these quantum features .    in order to investigate the dynamical loss of measurement resources , we need an approach somewhat different from the conventional state - centred view : decoherence and dissipation now take place in the _ heisenberg picture _",
    ", rendering the measurements less useful for revealing nonclassical properties .",
    "in fact , consider the general setting consisting of preparation of an entangled state shared by alice and bob , followed by noisy local evolution ( quantum channel ) on alice s side , and local measurements performed by alice and bob at the end . in this",
    "setting , one would usually write the associated joint probabilities in the schrdinger picture , with the local noise inducing loss of entanglement on the state . however , we can equivalently use the heisenberg picture , acting on alice s measurements .",
    "an essential starting point for our investigation is the fact that incompatibility can never be created but is often destroyed by the action of a quantum channel @xcite .",
    "how exactly this `` measurement decoherence '' takes place during actual open system dynamics has not been investigated before and the purpose of this paper is to take the first step in this direction by performing a quantitative analysis of the dynamical evolution of incompatibility .",
    "we concentrate on two well known microscopic open system models , where the dynamics can be tailored via environment engineering techniques : the phase damping @xcite and amplitude damping @xcite evolutions under both markovian and non - markovian noise .",
    "we find that both evolutions exhibit sudden death of incompatibility of quantum measurements , even though no entanglement sudden death occurs .",
    "we further study the case of a highly engineered amplitude damping dynamics , given by a photonic band gap environment , which has been found to efficiently protect entanglement in the long time limit @xcite .",
    "we find that even for such a highly engineered scenario the incompatibility of relevant measurements can not be maintained .",

    "we first recall that a general quantum measurement is described by a povm , which ( assuming a finite set of measurement outcomes ) is a map @xmath0 assigning a positive operator @xmath1 to each outcome @xmath2 and satisfying the normalisation condition @xmath3 . two measurements @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "are _ compatible _ or _ jointly measurable _ if there exists a measurement @xmath6 such that @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "intuitively , this means that the measurements can be realised together with a single device .",
    "the definition extends naturally to collections containing more than two measurements . for the purposes of the present investigation , however , studying the evolution pairs is sufficient .",
    "if the measurements are not compatible , they are said to be _",
    "incompatible_. in this case they can potentially be used for producing nonclassical features as discussed in the introduction .",
    "in order to quantify incompatibility , some of the authors of this paper recently introduced @xcite the concept of a _ incompatibility monotone _ as a function @xmath9 on pairs of observables , required to satisfy the following conditions :    * @xmath10 if and only if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are compatible . * @xmath11 if @xmath12 is any channel .",
    "the channel @xmath12 in ( ii ) can be either a quantum channel applied before the measurement , or a classical channel applied on the measurement outcomes .",
    "this definition of an incompatibility monotone is analogous to entanglement monotones @xcite .    in order to define an explicit quantification satisfying the above conditions",
    ", one can use @xcite the general resource - theoretic notion of _ noise - robustness _ @xcite .",
    "basically the idea is to use classical selection noise as a reference . in our case , this can be operationally implemented as follows : we think of implementing a measurement @xmath4 using a noisy device which sometimes ( with probability @xmath13 ) ignores the actual outcome , and instead outputs randomly an outcome @xmath2 according to some fixed probability distribution @xmath14 .",
    "the povm @xmath15 describing the resulting deformed measurement is then @xmath16 and for a given pair @xmath17 of measurements , we look for the minimal value of @xmath13 for which the noise - deformed pair @xmath18 becomes compatible : @xmath19 it is easy to see that this function fulfils the properties ( i ) and ( ii ) of an incompatibility monotone , and we also know that @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "there are also other choices for incompatibility monotones , of which we have included a brief discussion in sec .",
    "in this paper we focus exclusively on single qubit systems for which the optimisation can be reduced to solving a single polynomial equation ( see discussion in @xcite ) . in order to describe this ,",
    "we first need to recall the representation of qubit measurements .",

    "in fact , it coincides with the maximal violation of the chsh - bell inequality achievable with alice s measurements fixed to be @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "in order to illustrate the relationship between entanglement and incompatibility in noisy systems , it is helpful to begin with a simple case where the noise is purely classical , obtained by mixing with a completely depolarising noise .",
    "this is a variant of the selection noise used already in the preceding section to define the incompatibility quantification , and appears in the construction of the well - known isotropic states @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a maximally entangled state of a bipartite system .",
    "the parameter @xmath53 describes classical random selection noise added to the maximally entangled state , and one can show that the state loses its entanglement at some critical value @xmath54 , remaining separable for @xmath55 .",

    "one should notice the following important observation @xcite : _ the nonexistence of the hidden state model for the correlations @xmath65 is equivalent to incompatibility of alice s noisy local observables _",
    "@xmath66 in particular , this means that the observables @xmath67 lose their incompatibility at the amount of noise @xmath68 where the hidden state model comes into existence . for @xmath69 ,",
    "the measurements have some degree of incompatibility , which can be quantified as described in the preceding section . in the next section ,",
    "we proceed to investigate this loss of incompatibility under more complicated quantum noise channels arising from dynamical interaction with a quantum environment .",
    "evolution of an open quantum system can be described by a family @xmath70 of quantum channels indexed by the time parameter @xmath71 .",
    "this map is typically obtained by assuming unitary dynamics @xmath72 on a total system consisting also of an environment , initialised in a given state @xmath73 .",

    "the properties of the measurements may crucially change depending on the point in time at which the measurements are performed .",
    "in particular , incompatibility , as quantified by any incompatibility monotone @xmath9 , becomes a function of time : @xmath80    as a motivating starting point for our investigation , a few general remarks can be made concerning the case where @xmath81 is a continuous _ semigroup _",
    ", i.e. , @xmath82 in this case it follows directly from the general properties ( i ) and ( ii ) of an incompatibility monotone that the function is nonincreasing .",

    ". bob s measurements do not play a role in this setting .",
    "we remark that such asymmetry appears naturally in one - sided protocols such as steering @xcite mentioned in the introduction .",

    "we stress that this specific choice is not crucial , since the connection between incompatibility and entanglement holds for any bipartite state @xcite .",

    "moreover , we would like to note that for the models considered here , the entanglement dynamics happens to be equivalent to the dynamics of the information flux @xcite the non - monotonicity of which indicates the non - markovian character of the dynamics .",

    "this type of evolution can be experimentally implemented , for instance , in an optical setup @xcite , where the environment can be easily tuned so as to produce a variety of dynamics both in the markovian and non - markovian regimes .",
    "in fact , the time evolution of a photon traveling in a quartz plate may be described by a unitary operator @xmath118 defined by @xmath119 where @xmath120 represents the refraction index for light with polarization @xmath121 .",

    "thus , it is crucial to study how the quantum properties of the measurements are influenced by noise .    in this paper , we investigated the evolution of incompatibility of a pair of quantum measurements under two commonly studied dynamical maps , dephasing ( in the @xmath161-direction ) and amplitude damping .",

    "concerning our specific choice of the incompatibility measure @xcite , there are alternatives , such as  incompatibility weight \" @xcite based on the steering quantification in @xcite .",
    "the resulting incompatibility measure has recently been compared with ours in @xcite ( see especially fig . 2 therein ) ; while there are strong quantitative differences , the qualitative behaviour is relatively similar except for special cases .",
    "finally , we wish to point out that our work on the dynamics of incompatibility in open systems has a natural application in quantum optimal control , namely finding optimal measurement resources for , say , noisy steering by using the incompatibility quantification as a figure of merit .",
    "such a study has recently been carried out by one of the present authors @xcite .",
