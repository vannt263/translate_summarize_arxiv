    "transport properties of quantum dots , antidots and related structures are affected by the nature of current - carrying states in the leads connecting these structures to electron reservoirs . in sufficiently high magnetic fields",
    "the current - carrying states are the edge states propagating in a close vicinity to the sample boundaries@xcite .",
    "a detailed information on the structure of the edge states represent a key to the understanding of various features of the magnetotransport in the quantum hall regime .",
    "a quantitative description of the edge states for the case of the gate - induced confinement of the high - mobility two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) was given by chklovskii _",
    "@xcite , who provided an analytical solution for the positions and widths of the compressible and incompressible strips arising in the 2deg due to the electrostatic screening . in the compressible regions ,",
    "the landau bands are pinned at the fermi energy @xmath0 .",
    "this leads to a metallic behavior when the electron density is redistributed ( compressed ) to keep the electrostatic potential constant . in the incompressible regions , where the fermi energy lies in the landau gaps , all the levels below @xmath0 are completely filled and hence the electron density is constant ( which is consistent with the behavior of the incompressible liquid ) .    a number of studies addressing the problem of electron - electron interaction in quantum wires beyond the electrostatic treatment of the edge states of chklovskii _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have been reported during the recent decade@xcite .",
    "the many - body aspects of the problem have been included within thomas - fermi@xcite , hartree - fock@xcite , screened hartree - fock@xcite , and the density functional theory @xcite .",
    "the full quantum - mechanical calculations based on the self - consistent solution of the schrdinger equation have been done within the hartree@xcite and the density functional theory@xcite approximations .",
    "a particular attention has been devoted to investigation of the spin polarization effects in edge states @xcite .",
    "for example , dempsey _ _ et al.__@xcite _ _ have shown that for a sufficiently smooth confining potential , spin degeneracy of the outermost edge state is lifted and two spin channels become spatially separated .",
    "the interest to the spin - related effects in quantum wires is also motivated by significant current activity in semiconductor spintronics , that utilizes the spin degree of freedom of an electron to add the additional functionality to electronic devices . a number of proposed and investigates devices for spintronics applications operates in the edge state regime@xcite , which obviously requires a detailed knowledge of the spatial dependence of the spin - resolved states in the quantum wires .",
    "edge states have also been proposed as one - way channels for transporting quantum information@xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the spin / charge structure of the current carrying states is also essential for numerical simulation and modelling of the magnetotransport in quantum dots and related structures ( note that such the modelling is often done utilizing single - electron wave functions in the leads disregarding the spin / many electron effects@xcite ) . in order to obtain such the information on quantum - mechanical propagating states in quantum wires , one has to solve the schdinger equation incorporating the exchange interaction to account for the spin effects . in should be noted that the studies reported so far are often limited to some strictly integer filling factors@xcite , or utilize thomas - fermi - type approaches@xcite or perturbative technique@xcite , where the required information concerning the quantum - mechanical wave functions is not available .",
    "moreover , the quantum - mechanical effects associated with the finite extension of the wave function ( not included in e.g. thomas - fermi approach ) can play a decisive role for the quantitative description of the edge states .",
    "for example , suzuki and ando@xcite have demonstrated ( in a model of spinless electron ) that the predictions of chklovskii _ et al .",
    "_ and thomas - fermi models regarding the existence and the size of the compressible / incompressible strips are in qualitative disagreement with the self - consistent modelling based on the schrdinger equation in the regime when the estimated width of the strips is smaller than the extend of the wave functions .",
    "the purpose of the present article is two - fold .",
    "first , we perform a detailed self - consistent solution of the schrdinger equation incorporating spin / many - body effects in quantum wires . we discuss how the spin - resolved subband structure , the current densities , the confining potentials , as well as the spin polarization of the electron and current densities evolve when an applied magnetic field varies .",
    "we demonstrate that the exchange and correlation interactions dramatically affects the magnetosubbands in quantum wires bringing qualitatively new features in comparison to a widely used model of spinless electrons in hartree approximation . in the present study we limit ourself to the regime when more than one spin - resolved state can propagate in the wire , i.e. the filling factor @xmath1 ( the filling factor @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the sheet electron density",
    ", @xmath4 is the number of states in each landau level per unit area , and @xmath5 is the magnetic length ) .",
    "second , we present a detailed description of the developed method based on the green s function technique for the calculation of the subband structure and propagating states in the quantum wires in the magnetic field .",
    "this method is numerically stable , and its efficiency is related to the fact that calculations of the wave functions and wave vectors are reduced to the solution of the eigenvalue problem ( as opposed to the conventional methods that require less efficient procedure of the root searching@xcite ) .",
    "the major advantage of the present method is that it can be directly incorporated into magnetotransport calculations , because it provides the eigenstates and wave vectors at the given energy , not at a given wavevector ( as the conventional methods do ) .",
    "besides , the present method calculates the green s function of the wire , which can be subsequently used in the recursive green s function technique@xcite widely utilized for magnetotransport calculations in lateral structures .    in order to incorporate the spin / many - body effects into the scrdinger equation we use the density functional theory ( dft ) in the local spin - density approximation@xcite .",
    "the choice of the dft is motivated , on one hand , by its efficiency and simplicity in the practical implementation within usual self - consistent formulation introduced by kohn and sham@xcite , and , on the other hand , by its success in the reproduction of the electronic and spin properties of the low - dimensional structures in comparison to the exact diagonalization and quantum monte - carlo calculations , as well as experiments ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , ferconi and vignale@xcite find that the accuracy of the dft for the energy and density of few - electron quantum dots yields the accuracy better than 3% in comparison to the exact results .",
    "an excellent agreement between dft and the variational monte - carlo results for the chemical potential and the addition spectra of the rectangular quantum dot was reported by rsnen _ _ et al.__@xcite .    within the local spin density approximation",
    "the exchange and correlation potentials are calculated using a parameterization of the functional for the exchange and correlation energy @xmath6 the latter is usually obtained on the basis of quantum monte carlo calculations @xcite for corresponding infinite homogeneous system . in the present paper",
    "we use the parameterization of tanatar and cerperly ( tc ) @xcite .",
    "this parameterization is valid for magnetic field when @xmath1 , which defines the range of applicability of our results .",
    "( various parameterizations for @xmath7 for strong fields @xmath8 as well as different interpolation schemes between the low and the strong fields are reviewed in refs .",
    "note that the dft was used for the description of the spin polarization of the edge states in quantum wires in the integer hall regime within thomas - fermi approximation@xcite , as well as for the treatment of spinless edge states in the kohn - sham scheme based on the solution of the schrdinger equation@xcite .",
    "the density functional theory within the thomas - fermy approach was also applied for the description of the edge channels in the quantum wire in the fractional hall regime , where the parameterization of @xmath7 incorporated the additional gaps that open up at the fractional filling factors@xcite .",
