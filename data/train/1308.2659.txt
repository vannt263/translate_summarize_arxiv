    "during the last two decades we have witnessed an explosion of interest on mathematical models in finance . indeed ,",
    "the need for tools to understand risk and volatility in equity and commodity prices is crucial for the financial industry .",
    "a well accepted class of models consists of an extension of the black - scholes model known as local - volatility models .",
    "it was pioneered by b.  dupire in @xcite for the continuous case and has been a standard in many financial applications .",
    "local volatility models subsume that the volatility coefficient in the stochastic differential equation that determines the dynamics of the underlying is a function of time and of the underlying at that time .",
    "the calibration of such surface becomes fundamental for the consistent pricing of more complex derivatives .",
    "in this article we are concerned with the calibration of local - volatility models from option market data in a realistic setting that incorporates the availability of noisy and discrete financial data .",
    "mathematically , it is connected to the identification of a ( nonconstant ) diffusion coefficient in a parabolic equation .",
    "it is well known that such calibration problem , as many important ones in mathematical finance , is highly ill - posed . in particular , small changes and noise in the data may lead to substantial changes in the results . yet , good volatility surface calibration is crucial in a plethora of applications , including risk management , hedging , and the evaluation of exotic derivatives . in order to tackle the ill - posedness of the calibration we make use of ( non quadratic ) tikhonov - type regularization techniques and extend previous work @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we extend the results presented in @xcite for a discrete setting , under less restrictive assumptions than the ones used in @xcite .",
    "the introduction of regularization techniques in order to stabilize the problem leads to a crucial question : if the noise in the data goes to zero , does the corresponding regularized solution converge to the true volatility ?",
    "if this is the case , it would be also natural to inquire about the rate of convergence .    in the sequel",
    ", we shall respond such questions by recalling some results present in literature @xcite .",
    "such results concern existence and stability of the regularized solutions as well as convergence and convergence rate in terms of the noise level .",
    "[ [ the - novelty - and - main - contributions - of - the - present - article ] ] the novelty and main contributions of the present article + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    while keeping the underlying model in a context of partial differential equations and continuous variables , we apply a discretization process that determines the level of regularization in the coarse grid associated to the available data .",
    "this brings the problem from a context of infinite dimensional identification to a finite dimensional one in a regularized way . at this point ,",
    "our contribution is the proof of results concerning the regularizing properties of finite dimensional solutions , the noise level and the levels of discretization in the range and in the domain of the forward operator .",
    "in particular , the convergence rate result , under this setting , shows that there is an intrinsic relation between the level of discretization in the domain and the noise of the observed prices .",
    "more precisely , given the noise level and the level of discretization in the range of the forward operator , there is an optimal level of discretization in the domain @xmath0 of @xmath1 that minimizes the distance between the regularized solution and the true local volatility surface .",
    "it can be intuitively interpreted as follows : + _ if we use very few elements in the discretization of @xmath2 , the resulting surface could not capture the variability of the original local volatility , i.e. , the regularized solution would be almost constant .",
    "on the other hand , if we use too many elements , the inverse problem would be under - determined .",
    "thus , given the level of uncertainties associated to the data , there should be an optimal choice for the discretization level of @xmath2 . _ + this can be seen as a discrepancy principle w.r.t the level of discretization in the domain of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , choosing an appropriate level of discretization in the domain of the operator @xmath1 is crucial for achieving reliable solutions .",
    "one way of obtaining this is by accounting separately for the uncertainty contributions in the discretization levels for the domain and image , and the noise level from market bid and ask spread when implementing the inverse problem analysis .",
    "the convergence rate result in section  [ sec : discrete ] , is , in certain sense , a theoretical evidence of this feature , since it states how distant , in an appropriate sense , a reconstructed local volatility surface is from the true solution in terms of the three quantities above mentioned .",
    "this discrete setting gives us sufficient conditions to explore better the third main point of the present work , the numerical implementation of different regularization approaches , that allows us to illustrate the theoretical results presented in section  [ sec : discrete ] .",
    "this contribution is presented in section  [ sec : numerical ] .",

    "we assume that the volatility term in equation  ( [ ito1 ] ) is a deterministic function of time and asset price : @xmath19 it follows that , when we fix the current time and the current stock price , by setting @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the option price @xmath22 , as a function of its maturity and strike , satisfies dupire s equation  @xcite .",

    "mentioned , in this article we are concerned with the problem of calibrating the local volatility surface from traded european call option prices .",
    "this so - called inverse problem can be stated as : + _ given a set of traded option prices @xmath47 , find the associated local volatility surface @xmath48 satisfying the following operator equation : _ @xmath49 one solution for this inverse problem was proposed by dupire  @xcite , where , under no - arbitrage conditions , we could find local volatility through the formula ( in log - moneyness variables ) : @xmath50 unfortunately , this formula is not applicable in practice , since it implies in differentiating a noisy data , which is given in a sparse grid .",
    "note that , when stating problem  ( [ eq : operator1 ] ) , we have assumed that the data @xmath51 is known with infinite precision in the whole domain . in order to be more realistic , we consider that , when measuring the data we have some sources of uncertainties and noise , which arise specially from the sparsity of data , bid - ask spread , delays and interpolation . in addition , it is well known that the forward operator @xmath1 , defined in ( [ eq : operator ] ) , is compact . see @xcite .",
    "it implies that small perturbations in the data may lead to substantial changes in the reconstructed solution .",

    "may lead to substantial changes in the reconstructions .",
    "given the importance of good model selection for the volatility surface , a great amount of effort had been made in order to tackle the ill - posedness of the calibration @xcite .    for notational simplicity",
    "we formulate this calibration problem in an infinite dimensional framework .",

    "the most common regularization strategy for volatility calibration in the literature includes entropy based regularization @xcite , or convex type regularization @xcite .",
    "a unified approach of those tikhonov - type regularization was derived in @xcite by means of the minimization of the tikhonov functional @xmath89 over @xmath90 . in",

    "it is easy to see that the convex tikhonov - type functional defined in example  [ ex : quadratic ] has stable minimizers that converge to the true local volatility surface when the noise level vanishes .",
    "however , for the kullback - leibler regularization approach of example  [ ex : kl ] , it is necessary to make additional assumptions .",
    "indeed , in order to state the convergence analysis for the kullback - leibler regularization , it is necessary to consider the weak - to - weak convergence of the forward operator ( see theorem  [ th : prop - f ] item ( ii ) ) combined with the following inequality @xcite ,    @xmath145    it guarantees the closedness of the graph of the tikhonov functional with kullback - leibler regularization .",

    "such a result allows us to take into account different levels of uncertainties in the traded prices and convert it into estimates for the choice of the discretization level of the volatility calibration .",
    "in particular , our theoretical and numerical results show that there exists an intrinsic connection between different levels of uncertainty in the data and the corresponding calibrated volatility surface . furthermore",
    ", if the uncertainty level goes to zero , then the calibrated volatility converges to the true volatility .",
    "finally , if we have an upper bound on the financial data uncertainty , then there exists an optimal choice for the discretization level of the volatility surface .",
    "although we do not present a theoretical proof , we proposed a discrepancy principle to determine the optimal discretization level .",
    "this claim is illustrated by the results of section  [ sec : synthetic ] .",
    "the theoretical aspects concerning the implementation of this discrepancy principle are beyond the scope of the present work and shall be discussed in @xcite .",
    "we also presented reconstructions of the local volatility surface with market data .",
    "using s&p500 data as a validation criteria , we compared the implied volatility obtained from traded data and the prices given by the model .",
    "this was compared to the volume information in the validation of results .",

    "however , for prices near or at the money , we also had a good match of the implied volatilities of market and model prices .",
