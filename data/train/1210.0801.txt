    ", as is usual , @xmath56 denotes the lattice of algebraic homomorphisms @xmath57 . the dual space @xmath58 can be identified with @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the lattice of cocharacters @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath62 denote the root system of @xmath2 with respect to @xmath53 .",
    "the affine apartment @xmath63 is just @xmath58 , together with a hyperplane configuration @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is an affine hyperplane in @xmath58 for each @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this hyperplane configuration allows us to think of @xmath68 as a simplicial complex .",
    "the vertices of this simplicial complex are the points in the weight lattice @xmath69    the affine linear functional @xmath70 is usually denoted by @xmath71 .",
    "the affine root system is the set of affine linear functionals on @xmath68 given by @xmath72 if @xmath73 denotes the normalizer @xmath74 of @xmath53 in @xmath6 , then @xmath73 contains @xmath75 as a normal subgroup with quotient @xmath76 , which is , by definition , the weyl group of @xmath2 with respect to @xmath53 .",
    "in fact @xmath73 is a semidirect product : @xmath77    fix a uniformizing element @xmath26 in the ring of integers of @xmath0 . recall that , if for each @xmath78 , we define @xmath79 to be the element @xmath80 , then @xmath81 gives rise to an isomorphism @xmath82 denote by the @xmath83 the inverse of the above isomorphism composed with the quotient map @xmath84 .",
    "the affine apartment @xmath68 is an @xmath73-space ( in the sense that there is an action of @xmath73 on @xmath68 which preserves the hyperplane configuration ) .",
    "the action is as follows : @xmath85 the reason that the hyperplane configuration is preserved is that @xmath86&=\\alpha(\\vartheta(t))+{}^w\\mu)+n\\\\      & = \\alpha^w(\\mu)+\\alpha(\\vartheta(t))+n\\\\      & = [ \\alpha^w+\\alpha(\\vartheta(t))](\\mu)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that composing with the @xmath73-action on @xmath68 takes an affine root to another affine root .",
    "the action of @xmath73 on @xmath68 factors through the quotient of @xmath73 by @xmath87 , which is called the affine weyl group of @xmath2 : @xmath88    to each point @xmath89 is associated a parahoric subgroup @xmath90 of @xmath6 such that @xmath91 is the isotropy subgroup of @xmath92 in @xmath73 .",

    "more generally , @xmath112 if and only if @xmath113 if and only if @xmath114 . in other words , the stabilizer of @xmath115 is the parahoric subgroup @xmath116 .    had we chosen a different split torus @xmath117 which was conjugate to @xmath53 , we would have begun with an apartment @xmath118 corresponding to @xmath117",

    "these subsets @xmath123 are known as the apartments of @xmath104 . a basic fact about the building",
    "is that any two points are contained in an apartment .",

    "in other words , @xmath128 and @xmath129 lie in @xmath68 .",
    "now @xmath68 itself has , up to scaling , a unique @xmath76-invariant inner product , and it is the distance between @xmath128 and @xmath129 with respect to a fixed such inner product that we declare to be the distance between @xmath92 and @xmath126",
    ".    we may normalize the metric on @xmath104 by normalising the @xmath76-invariant inner product on @xmath68 , which may be achieved by declaring that the diameter of each connected component of the complement of the union of the hyperplane configuration @xmath64 as @xmath71 varies over the set @xmath130 of affine roots has diameter one .",

    "as sets , these are exactly the same ; they are both isomorphic to @xmath59 .",
    "however , the identity map is not the correct way to identify @xmath135 with @xmath134 . recall that @xmath135 and @xmath134 comes with actions of @xmath136 and @xmath137 respectively .",
    "let @xmath138 denote the emedding of @xmath139 as a subgroup of @xmath140 .",

    "we may apply the construction of section  [ section : defn - building ] to @xmath6 as well as @xmath5 resulting in two different buildings , which we denote by @xmath4 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "the equations ( [ eq : actions ] ) and ( [ eq : parahorics ] ) imply that the map @xmath146 descends to an inclusion of @xmath4 in @xmath3 .",
    "the stabilizer of the image of @xmath147 in @xmath4 ( which is a vertex of @xmath4 ) is @xmath148 , and similarly , the stabilizer of @xmath149 in @xmath3 is @xmath150 .",
    "since multiplication by @xmath142 is an isomorphism @xmath151 of simplicial complexes , it follows that , for @xmath152 ( which can also be thought of as points of @xmath134 ) @xmath153 since any two points in @xmath154 are contained in some apartment , remains valid for any @xmath155 .",
    "@xmath156    embedded trees for @xmath157 ( totally ramified case )    0.2 in    in this section we sketch a proof of theorem  [ theorem - entropy ] , in the case @xmath158 , and thus where the buildings @xmath4 and @xmath3 are regular trees .",
    "we first decompose the field extension @xmath159 as a chain of two extensions @xmath160 and @xmath161 , where @xmath160 is a totally ramified extension of degree @xmath142 and @xmath161 is an unramified extension of degree @xmath16 .",
    "we fix notation : @xmath162 will denote natural logarithm , and let @xmath163 denote the volume of the ball ( with respect to counting measure on vertices ) of radius @xmath164 in a @xmath165-regular tree , that is @xmath166 we note that @xmath167 there is a prime power @xmath168 so that @xmath4 is a @xmath169-regular tree , which immediately yields @xmath170 here , and below , we drop the measure @xmath42 from the definition of entropy as we will work exclusively with counting measure , taking advantage of the fact that the entropy @xmath44 is invariant under scaling .",
    "we treat the unramified and fully ramified cases in turn , before working out the general case .      as above , @xmath160 is a totally ramified extension of degree @xmath142 .",
    "then the tree @xmath171 is formed by subdividing each edge of @xmath4 into @xmath142 segments by adding @xmath172 vertices . to each of these",
    ", we attach a rooted tree , where the root has valence @xmath173 , and all the descendants have valence @xmath169 ( @xmath13 descendants and one parent ) .",
    "thus , the resulting @xmath171 is a @xmath169-regular tree .",
    "the metric @xmath174 gives each edge length @xmath39 , thus , we have @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the ball of radius @xmath164 in the metric @xmath174 ( we will also write @xmath177 and @xmath178 to mean balls of radius @xmath164 in the @xmath31 metric and @xmath32 metrics respectively ) . in this case , we have that the metric spaces @xmath179 and @xmath180 are isometric ( both being metric @xmath169-regular trees ) , but @xmath181 is not isometric to either , since the inclusion @xmath182 is not an isometry",
    ".      now consider the unramified extension @xmath161 of degree @xmath16 . here",
    ", the tree @xmath183 is formed from the tree @xmath171 by adding @xmath184 edges to each vertex , and then rooted @xmath185-valent trees to each new vertex ( that is , the root has @xmath186-children , and each descendant has @xmath186 further descendants ) . here , the inclusion @xmath187 is an isometry , but the metric spaces @xmath188 and @xmath180 are clearly not isometric .",
    "thus , @xmath189      to construct @xmath3 from @xmath4 , we combine the two procedures , and thus obtain @xmath190 taking @xmath191 , dividing by @xmath164 , and letting @xmath192 , we obtain , as desired @xmath193 and noting that @xmath194 , we obtain theorem  [ theorem - entropy ] .",
    "the proof of the main theorem follows along similar lines to the argument in  [ sec : proof - trees ] . in the three lemmas below",
    ", we explicitly compute the volumes of balls in bruhat - tits buildings .",
    "the result follows upon taking ratios of volume entropies .      for @xmath78 let @xmath200 denote the image of @xmath201 in @xmath202 , which we may regard as an element of @xmath199 .",
    "by @xcite , @xmath203 , where @xmath204 denotes half the sum of positive roots . consider the hyperplane @xmath205 if @xmath206 is dominant and non - zero , then clearly , @xmath207 ( since @xmath208 for all @xmath209 ) .",
    "therefore , this hyperplane intersects each ray in the dominant cone at exactly one point .",
    "it follows ( since the dominant cone is pointed - see theorem  1.26 of @xcite ) that the intersection of @xmath210 with the dominant cone is compact .",
    "it follows that there exist positive constants @xmath211 and @xmath212 such that for any dominant point @xmath92 in @xmath210 , @xmath213 by scaling any dominant point of @xmath58 into @xmath210 , it follows that @xmath214 now any @xmath196 can be written as @xmath215 for @xmath216 and @xmath217 . since the lengths of elements in the finite weyl group form a bounded set , and the metric in @xmath68 is @xmath76-invariant , it follows that @xmath218 .",
