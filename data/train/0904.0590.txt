    "progress in cosmic ray ( cr ) physics@xcite has been hampered for long time by the deflection of charged cosmic rays in magnetic fields , preventing the identification of individual sources .",
    "this problem could be solved by using the neutral messengers that should be produced as secondaries in hadronic cr interactions close to the source . however , the secondary photons generated are difficult to disentangle from photons produced by synchrotron radiation or inverse compton scattering of electrons .",
    "moreover , high energy photons are strongly absorbed both in the source and propagating over extragalactic distances . by contrast , the extremely large mean free path of neutrinos together with the relatively poor angular resolution of neutrino telescopes and the small expected event numbers makes the identification of extragalactic sources challenging using only the neutrino signal .",
    "performing neutrino astronomy beyond the establishment of a diffuse neutrino background requires therefore most likely additional input , either timing or angular information from high energy photon or cr experiments .    the recently announced evidence@xcite for a correlation of the arrival directions of uhecrs observed by the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) with active galactic nuclei ( agn ) may provide a first test case for successful `` multi - messenger astronomy . ''",
    "in particular , ref",
    ".   finds two events within the search bin of @xmath3 around the nearest active galaxy , centaurus  a ( cen  a ) .",
    "this fr  i radio galaxy is located close to the supergalactic plane at a distance of about 4 mpc ( see ref .   for more details ) . at present this correlation ,",
    "not confirmed by the hires experiment@xcite , has only @xmath4  c.l . and",
    "other source types that follow the large - scale structure of matter would also result in an excess of events along the supergalactic plane .    in ref .",
    ", we studied therefore the possibility to observe cen  a using high - energy photons and neutrinos . taking the correlation signal at face value",
    ", we used the pao results as normalization of the cr flux and calculated the flux of accompanying secondary photons and neutrinos expected from hadronic interactions in the source . since both the fermi lat collaboration  @xcite and the h.e.s.s .",
    "collaboration  @xcite reported recently the discovery of @xmath5-ray emission from cen  a , we have now the opportunity to check our predictions against these observations .",
    "we calculated the flux of high energy cosmic rays and of accompanying secondary photons and neutrinos expected from cen  a for two different scenarios : acceleration close to the core , either in accretion shocks or regular electromagnetic fields , and acceleration in the radio jet .",
    "in the first case uv photons are the most important scattering targets .",
    "we modeled the primary photon field around the agn core guided by the simplest possible theoretical model@xcite , namely the thermal emission from a geometrically thin , optically thick keplerian accretion disc .",
    "the interaction depth for photo - hadron interactions can reach @xmath6  few . according to the observational data we found that pp interactions of uhe protons with the gas provide the main source of cr interactions in the second scenario . in this case ,",
    "moreover , diffusion in the turbulent magnetic fields will increase the interaction depth at low and intermediate energies .",
    "we considered also three spectra @xmath7 of the injected protons : power - laws with @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and a broken power - law with @xmath10 for @xmath11ev .",
    "we based our calculations on several simplifying assumptions like the use of an one - dimensional geometry and the omission of the acceleration process .",
    "in particular , we only postulated that acceleration to @xmath12ev is possible in the environment of cen  a , without demonstrating it for a concrete model .",
    "finally , hadronic interactions are simulated with an extension of the monte carlo code described in ref .  .",
    "figure  [ spec1 ] displays the particle fluxes predicted@xcite from cen  a as function of the energy , assuming that the two events observed by pao around cen  a indeed originate from this agn .",
    "the case of acceleration close to the core is shown on the left , while the case of acceleration in the jet is shown on the right . from the top to the bottom , spectra are displayed for a broken power - law , @xmath9 , and @xmath8 .",
    "in addition to the injected proton flux ( black solid line ) , we show the flux of protons ( black dashed ) , photons ( blue solid ) and neutrinos ( red solid ) arriving on earth .",
    "note that the cutoff in the neutrino and proton spectra below 100gev is artificial , since we neglect neutrinos and protons with lower energies in our simulation . in the core model",
    "the final proton flux is reduced by photon - proton interactions by a factor @xmath13 above the threshold energy @xmath14ev ( left ) , while diffusion in the jet increases the interaction depth for lower energies ( right ) , resulting in the effective production of secondaries . since the cr spectra are normalized to the integral uhecr flux above @xmath15ev , steeper spectra result in larger secondary fluxes at low energies .",
    "while we could show earlier@xcite these fluxes only together with an upper limit from h.e.s.s .  and the estimated sensitivity of fermi for point sources , we have updated now these figures with the recently published results from fermi@xcite and h.e.s.s .",
    "+ citeaharonian:2009xn . remarkably , the photon flux in the fermi and the h.e.s.s .",
    "energy range has approximately the same power - law exponent ( @xmath16 and 2.7 ) , but the latter requires a larger normalization constant .",
    "such a behavior is expected , if a new component , e.g.  of hadronic origin , sets in above 100  gev , while at lower energies photons of electromagnetic origin dominate the spectrum . for a more detailed test of this hypothesis in the future , the differential energy spectrum at the high - energy end of the fermi spectrum will be most useful .    the most important consequence of the recent h.e.s.s",
    ".  results is to significantly disfavor the jet scenario . in spite of the uncertainties in the normalization , the almost flat spectrum predicted in this model",
    "is in contradiction with the shape of the @xmath5-ray spectrum observed by h.e.s.s .",
    "moreover , the angular extension of the photon flux observed by h.e.s.s .  is consistent with a point source at the agn core and excludes thereby the radio lobes as sources .    on the contrary , the shape of the @xmath5-ray spectrum observed by h.e.s.s .",
    "agrees very well with the slope expected in the core model .",
    "the fermi measurements restrict additionally the source model , excluding the broken - power law case that leads to an excessive photon fluxes in the gev range . in summary , a primary proton energy @xmath0 with @xmath1 or smaller in the case of acceleration close to the core",
    "is consistent with the h.e.s.s .",
    "and fermi observations , assuming that in the gev range the photon flux has dominantly an electromagnetic origin .",
    "finally , we comment on the neutrino fluxes to be expected from cen  a. calculating the expected event number in a neutrino telescope requires a definite choice of the experiment .",
    "centaurus  a is from the location of icecube only visible from above , and thus the background of atmospheric muons allows only the use of contained events that carry essentially no directional information . by contrast , a neutrino telescope in the mediterranean could make use of the muon signal and the directional information .",
    "the resulting event numbers both for cascade and shower event number per year observation time are summarized in table  [ tablei ] . for a discussion on the connection between cen",
    "a as source of uhecrs and the associated diffuse neutrino flux see ref .  .",
    "in summary , the combination of data from pao and h.e.s.s .  is consistent with a scenario where the uhecrs observed by pao are protons accelerated near the core .",
    "the vhe @xmath5-rays detected by h.e.s.s .",
    "would then have a hadronic origin , namely , the interaction of the accelerated protons with the uv photons surrounding the core .",
    "this model is expected to be tested in the near future as the currently running pao , h.e.s.s .",
    "and fermi experiments increase their statistics .",
