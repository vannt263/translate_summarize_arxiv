    "there are two approaches to characterizing spacetime singularities in a cosmological context .",
    "the first approach may be called _ geometric _ and consists of finding sufficient and/or necessary conditions for singularity formation , or absence , _ independently _ of any specific solution of the field equations under general conditions on the matter fields .",
    "methods of this sort include those based on an analysis of geodesic congruences in spacetime and lead to the well known singularity theorems , cf .",
    "@xcite , as well as those which are depend on an analysis of the geodesic equations themselves and lead to completeness theorems such as those expounded in cbc02 , and the classification of singularities in @xcite .    the second approach to the singularity problem can be termed _ dynamical _ and refers to characterizing cosmological singularities in a geometric theory of gravity by analysing the dynamical field equations of the theory _ _  _ _ it uses methods from the theory of dynamical systems and can be _ global _ , referring to the asymptotic behaviour of the system of field equations for large times , or _",
    "local _ , giving the behaviour of the field components in a small neighborhood of the finite - time singularity .    in this latter spirit",
    ", we present here a local method for the characterization of the asymptotic properties of solutions to the field equations of a given theory of gravity in the neighborhood of the spacetime singularity .",
    "we are interested in providing an asymptotic form for the solution near singularities of the gravitational field and understanding all possible dominant features of the field as we approach the singularity .",
    "we call this approach the _ method of asymptotic splittings . _    in the following sections , we give an outline of the method of asymptotic splittings with a view to its eventual application to cosmological spacetimes in different theories of gravity . for the sake of illustration , in the last section",
    "we analyze the asymptotic behaviour of a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe filled with perfect fluid in einstein s general relativity , which provides the simplest , nontrivial cosmological system .",
    "it is advantageous to work on any differentiable manifold @xmath0 , although for specific applications we restrict attention to open subsets or @xmath1 we shall use interchangeably the terms vector field @xmath2 and dynamical system defined by @xmath3 on @xmath0 , @xmath4 , with @xmath5 .",
    "also , we will use the terms integral curve @xmath6 of the vector field @xmath3 with initial condition @xmath7 , and solution of the associated dynamical system @xmath8 passing through the point @xmath9 , with identical meanings .    given a vector field @xmath3 on the @xmath10-dimensional manifold @xmath11 , we define the notion of a _ general _ solution of the associated dynamical system as a solution that depends on @xmath10 arbitrary constants of integration , @xmath12 .",
    "these constants are uniquely determined by the initial conditions in the sense that to each @xmath13 we can always find a @xmath14 such that the solution @xmath15 is the unique solution passing through the point @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , a property holds _ independently _ of the initial conditions if and only if it is a property of a general solution of the system .",
    "a _ particular _ solution of the dynamical system is any solution obtained from the general solution by assigning specific values to at least one of the arbitrary constants .",
    "the particular solutions containing @xmath16 arbitrary constants can be viewed as describing the evolution in time of sets of initial conditions of dimension @xmath16 strictly smaller than @xmath10 .",
    "a particular solution is called an _",
    "exact _ solution of the dynamical system when @xmath17 .",
    "thus , in our terminology , a particular solution is a more general object than any exact solution , the latter having the property that all arbitrary constants have been given specific values .",
    "the hierarchy : exact ( no arbitrary constants ) to particular ( strictly less than maximum number of arbitrary constants ) to general solutions , will play an important role in what follows .",
    "general , particular , or exact solutions of dynamical systems can develop _ finite - time singularities _ ; that is , instances where a solution @xmath18 , misbehaves at a finite value @xmath19 of the time @xmath20 .",
    "this is made precise as follows .",
    "we say that the system @xmath21 ( equivalently , the vector field @xmath3 ) has a _ finite - time singularity _ if there exists a @xmath22 and a @xmath23 such that for all @xmath24 there exists an @xmath25 such that @xmath26for @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 , @xmath29 for some @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ( resp .",
    "@xmath32 ) . note also , that @xmath33 is an arbitrary point in the domain @xmath34 and may be taken to mean ` now ' . alternatively , we may set @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and consider the solution in terms of the new time variable @xmath37 , @xmath38 , with a finite - time singularity at @xmath39 .",
    "we see that for a vector field to have a finite - time singularity there must be at least one integral curve passing through the point @xmath13 of @xmath40 such that at least one of its @xmath41 norms diverges at @xmath42 .",
    "we write @xmath43to denote a finite - time singularity at @xmath44 .",
    "one of the most interesting problems in the theory of singularities of vector fields is to find the structure of the set of points @xmath13 in @xmath45 such that , when evolved through the dynamical system defined by the vector field , the integral curve of @xmath3 passing through a point in that set satisfies property ( [ sing2 ] ) .",
    "another important question , of special interest in relativistic cosmology , is to discover the precise relation between the finite - time singularities of vector fields that arise as reductions of the field equations and those that emerge in the form of geodesic incompleteness .",
    "the difficulty here is that the finite - time singularities of vector fields appear to be unconnected to geodesic incompleteness and conversely , singularities which arise through the formation of conjugate points do not seem to demand , or require , any dynamical description .",
    "finite - time singularities of ( general or particular ) solutions of linear dynamical systems are located at the singularities of their coefficients and are _ fixed _ because they are known from the singularities of the coefficients of the system .",
    "the fixed singularities in a solution are therefore independent of the choice of initial conditions . in contrast",
    ", solutions of nonlinear systems can develop finite - time singularities that are either fixed or movable .",
    "a singularity is _ fixed _ if it is a singularity of @xmath46 for all @xmath47 ; otherwise , we say it is a _",
    "movable singularity_.    note that any fixed finite - time singularity of a particular solution ( @xmath48 ) can not be a fixed singularity of a general solution since at least one of the constants appearing in the general solution has been set to zero , and so this singularity is not one of a @xmath46 for _ all _ @xmath49 , that is independent of the initial conditions .",
    "hence , fixed finite - time singularities _ in a general solution _ can not be understood by studying fixed singularities in particular solutions . however , movable singularities of a particular solution , if they _",
    "are _ singularities ( in the sense of the definition above ) of the general solution , will always be movable ones .",
    "therefore , movable finite - time singularities in particular solutions make a nonzero contribution to the singularity pattern of the vector field and must be taken into consideration in the general study of its singularities .",
    "it may also happen that a dynamical system has no movable singularities in the general solution but still has a singular or particular solution with a movable singularity .",
    "hence , a fixed ( or movable ) singularity in a general solution can be a fixed ( or movable ) singularity of some particular solution but not vice versa .",
    "in general , movable singularities are more interesting , since the issue of choosing initial conditions plays an important role for them ; consequently , we shall restrict our attention to them almost exclusively in what follows .",
    "how should we tackle the geometric problem of describing the behaviour of vector fields and their integral curves  solutions of the associated dynamical system  in the neighborhood of a finite - time movable singularity ?",
    "assume that we are given a vector field , and we know that at some point , @xmath44 , a system of integral curves , corresponding to a particular or a general solution , has a ( future or past ) finite - time singularity in the sense of definition ( [ sing1 ] ) .",
    "the approach we take in this paper is an asymptotic one .",
    "the vector field ( or its integral curves ) can basically do two things sufficiently close to the finite - time singularity , namely , it can either show some dominant feature or not . in the latter case ,",
    "the integral curves can ` spiral ' in some way around the singularity _ ad infinitum _ so that ( [ sing1 ] ) is satisfied and the dynamics are totally controlled by the subdominant ( lower - order in terms of weight - see below ) terms , whereas in the former case solutions share a distinctly dominant behaviour on approach to the singularity at @xmath44 determined by the most nonlinear terms .    to describe both cases",
    "invariably , we decompose the vector field into simpler , component vector fields and examine whether the most nonlinear one of these shows a dominant behaviour while the rest become subdominant in some exact sense . using this picture",
    ", we then built a system of integral curves corresponding , where feasible , to the general solution , and sharing exactly its characteristics in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the finite - time singularity .",
    "the construction of these solutions is given as a formal asymptotic series expansion around the singularity and is done term - by - term .",
    "we begin by introducing some useful notation and terminology .",
    "we write @xmath50 to denote the function @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 a function of the form ( [ scale function ] ) is _ scale invariant _ in the sense that a change in the time scale , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , reveals that we must also have @xmath56 , and conversely .",
    "now we demand that a scale invariant function @xmath57 of the form ( [ scale function ] ) is an integral curve of the vector field @xmath3 passing through @xmath13 , or equivalently , the associated dynamical system @xmath21 has a particular solution that is scale invariant , valid in a neighborhood of the assumed finite - time singularity .",
    "this means that @xmath58the notation @xmath59 stands for the monomial @xmath60 and is valid for each @xmath61 ( range convention , no summation ) .",
    "we say that a vector field @xmath3 ( or the associated dynamical system ) is _ scale invariant _ if it satisfies @xmath62more generally , a vector field is called _ weight - homogeneous _ with _ weighted degree _",
    "@xmath63 if there is a vector @xmath64 , called _ the weight _ , and a vector @xmath65 such that @xmath66we denote the degree by @xmath67 .",
    "when @xmath68 the vector field is called _ homogeneous _ of degree @xmath63 . note that any scale invariant vector field is a weight - homogeneous field @xmath69 such that each component @xmath70 has degree @xmath71 , from which it follows that @xmath72 has weight @xmath73 .",
    "if @xmath3 has degree @xmath63 , then @xmath74 has degree @xmath75 , with @xmath76 the @xmath77-th unit vector .",
    "there are weight - homogeneous vector fields that are not scale invariant ; for instance , all linear dynamical systems with constant coefficients which are homogeneous vector fields .    using eqs .",
    "( [ basic1 ] ) , ( [ basic2 ] ) we see that given any nonzero vector @xmath78 , a scale - invariant vector field @xmath3 admits a scale - invariant integral curve provided that the inhomogeneous linear system @xmath79has nontrivial solutions for @xmath80 .",
    "note that there may be nontrivial solutions for @xmath80 with some components zero .",
    "when at least one of the components of @xmath80 is nonzero , the corresponding solution of the form ( [ scale function ] ) is a particular solution of the dynamical system .",
    "therefore , in this case , we know the exact asymptotic behaviour of the vector field @xmath3 in the neighborhood of a finite - time singularity , given by the solution ( [ scale function ] ) with suitable @xmath81 s and @xmath78 s .",
    "unfortunately , most vector fields are neither scale invariant nor weight - homogeneous . however , since any _ analytic _ vector field @xmath82 can be expanded in a power series in some domain @xmath83 , by taking any @xmath84 for any @xmath85 distinct from @xmath86 any such vector field can be decomposed into weight - homogeneous _ components _ by taking for instance the first @xmath87 terms in its taylor expansion around @xmath9 .",
    "a simpler example of a vector field admitting a weight - homogeneous splitting is to take @xmath3 to be any polynomial vector field ; then , a possible decomposition is to split it such that each component is a suitable combination of monomials .",
    "we say that the nonlinear vector field @xmath3 on @xmath0 admits a _ weight - homogeneous decomposition _ with respect to a given vector @xmath78 if it splits as a combination of the form @xmath88where the _ components _",
    "@xmath89 are weight - homogeneous vector fields , namely , @xmath90for some non - negative numbers @xmath91 and all @xmath80 in some domain @xmath92 of @xmath93 . in terms of individual components ,",
    "condition ( [ dec2 ] ) reads @xmath94 in a slightly vague but suggestive manner we can say that a weight - homogeneous decomposition splits the original vector field in parts starting by collecting together the most nonlinear part and then proceeding down to the ` weakest ' component such that each term in the splitting is ` less nonlinear ' than the previous one in a precise sense .",
    "there are two important features of such a vector - field decomposition ( dec1 ) , ( [ dec2 ] ) .",
    "firstly , it is not unique . in general , for the given vector field @xmath3 , many different vectors @xmath78 can be found which each lead to different weight - homogeneous decompositions of the vector field in the same domain @xmath95 .",
    "secondly , since the _ subdominant exponents _ @xmath96 can be ordered , @xmath97the degrees of the component vector fields in the decomposition ( [ dec2 ] ) are also ordered and ( only ) the first vector field @xmath98 appearing in the decomposition is scale invariant .",
    "therefore , a weight - homogeneous decomposition of a vector field with respect to a vector @xmath78 is a splitting into @xmath87 weight - homogeneous components each with degree @xmath99 such that the lowest - order vector field in the decomposition is scale invariant .",
    "the lowest - order vector field , @xmath98 , in a splitting is sometimes called _ the dominant part _ of @xmath3 and includes the most nonlinear terms in @xmath3 , whereas the remaining sum of parts , @xmath100 , is called _ the subdominant part_.    given a vector field @xmath101 it is very important to have the complete list of all possible weight - homogeneous decompositions it admits ; in other words , to know all the possible dominant and subdominant ways it can be split . the asymptotic method we employ to trace the behaviour of vector fields and their integral curves in a neighborhood of a movable finite - time singularity ( of a particular or general solution ) , begins by finding all weight - homogeneous decompositions of the vector field valid in that neighborhood .",
    "suppose that there exists a decomposition @xmath102into ( @xmath87 ) weight - homogeneous components , such that the dominant part @xmath103 is scale invariant , and each subdominant component @xmath104 is weight - homogeneous . the scale invariant solution @xmath105is a solution only , as complex ones do not describe the behaviour near finite time singularities in the sense of eq .",

    "thus , some of the components of the vector @xmath80 may vanish .",
    "we call the components of the vector @xmath108 the _ dominant exponents . _ in this case , we sometimes say that ( [ dec2 ] ) is an _ asymptotic solution _ of the original system @xmath109",
    ".    on the other hand , the @xmath16 subdominant components @xmath110 satisfy @xmath111with the subdominant exponents @xmath112 which are ordered and strictly positive .",
    "dividing both sides by @xmath113 and taking the limit as @xmath114 , the true meaning of the subdominant exponents is revealed , and we have _ 0=0 , which proves that the subdominant part of the vector field , @xmath115 , is less dominant than the dominant part , @xmath116 , which of course asymptotes as @xmath117 .",
    "we say that the pair @xmath118 is a _",

    ". there may be several different balances for any particular decomposition of @xmath3 and a way to classify them is by means of their order .",
    "the _ order _ of a balance @xmath119 is the number of the nonzero components of the vector @xmath80 . for a vector field on @xmath0 ,",
    "the highest order of any possible balance is @xmath10 and in this case the scale - invariant solution ( [ dec2 ] ) corresponds to a possible dominant behaviour of a _ general _ solution of the original system @xmath120 near the singularity . on the other hand , balances of a lower order than @xmath10",
    "describe possible asymptotics of _ particular _ solutions .",
    "there is an elegant convex - geometric explanation of the dominant balances of a vector field @xmath3 .",
    "this requires us first to express the vector field in the so - called quasi - monomial form .",
    "then , a dominant balance of order @xmath121 corresponds precisely to a @xmath121-dimensional face of the newton - puiseux - bruno polyhedron associated to @xmath3 ( cf .",

    "thus , from the last two equations , we find @xmath134that is , the k - matrix always has the vector @xmath135 as an eigenvector with eigenvalue equal to @xmath136 .",
    "we say that a balance is _ hyperbolic _ if the remaining @xmath137 k - exponents have positive real parts .",
    "suppose now that we know all the eigenvectors @xmath138 and eigenvalues @xmath139 of the k - matrix . by simply inspecting the form of the two sides in the variational equation for the dominant part of the vector field , namely , the equation @xmath140we can write the set of fundamental solutions @xmath141 of this linear equation for @xmath142 in the form @xmath143where , depending on whether or not @xmath127 is semi - simple , the @xmath144 s are the eigenvectors @xmath141 or , in general , polynomials in @xmath145 .",
    "hence , the solutions of the variational equation will be appropriate sums of terms by the form ( [ var ] ) .",
    "therefore , any solution of the original system will be well approximated ( cf .",
    "@xcite , p.299 , for the precise conditions ) by a solution of the form ( this is a taylor estimate ) : @xmath146where @xmath147where the @xmath148 s are , in general , polynomials in @xmath145 .",
    "furthermore , we arrive at the interesting conclusion that in any particular or general solution , the arbitrary constants characterizing it will first appear in those terms whose coefficients have indices equal to a k - exponent . in a general solution , the arbitrary constants normally appear at different places in an expansion , and consequently , a solution in which a k - exponent ( different from the @xmath149 value which as we have shown always exists ) is either negative , or has nontrivial multiplicity , may or may not be a general solution .",
    "we shall see in the next section how we can use eq .",
    "( [ main1 ] ) to obtain an important series representation of the solutions to the original dynamical system near a finite - time singularity .",
    "apart from the principal use made here in unravelling the nature of finite - time singularities , there are various important connections between the k - exponents , first integrals , integrability properties of hamiltonian systems and complex algebraic geometry , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "in the previous subsection , we derived the formal expansion ( [ main1 ] ) for the solution of the dynamical system @xmath150 near a finite - time singularity by including only the first terms in a power - series expansion of @xmath151 .",
    "that solution corresponds to a given dominant balance @xmath152 and depends on the k - exponents @xmath139 associated with the dominant part , @xmath116 , of the original vector field @xmath153 .",
    "writing eq .",
    "( [ main1 ] ) in full , that is including terms of all orders , can lead to very complicated expansions in general , and the essential feature is the appearance of logarithmic terms .",
    "we note that there are a number of general theorems guaranteeing the existence and convergence of such expansions  see , for instance , @xcite for a review .",
    "let @xmath154 be the set of all k - exponents with positive real parts . for simplicity",
    "we assume that all k - exponents in @xmath154 are rational , and define the number @xmath155 to be the least common multiple of the denominators of the numbers in the set @xmath156 . in the case where any log terms are absent ( for instance , when k is semi - simple ) , we can write , by ( [ main1 ] ) , the full expansion of the general solution around the finite - time singularity in the form of a _",
    "puiseux series _ ,",
    "@xmath157where , as we know already from the previous section , each of the @xmath10 arbitrary constants in ( [ main2 ] ) will first appear in the term with coefficient @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "hence , finding the final form of the solution ( general or particular , depending on the number of arbitrary constants appearing in the series expansion ) can be now reduced to knowing the coefficients @xmath160 in the expansion .",
    "these coefficients are computed by inserting the puiseux series ( [ main2 ] ) into the original system .",
    "this leads to a set of _ recursion relations _ , a linear system for the coefficients @xmath160 . for the @xmath77th - order coefficient",
    "we find @xmath161 where the forms @xmath162 are polynomial in its variable , read off from the original equation .",
    "there is an important consistency condition to be satisfied for the above analysis to be valid . multiplying both sides of ( [ main3 ] ) by @xmath163 , an eigenvector of the k - matrix",
    ", we see that when @xmath164 , an eigenvalue of the k - matrix , we must have the following _ compatibility condition _",
    "( @xmath165 denotes the adjoint eigenvector of @xmath166 ) : @xmath167therefore , if the above compatibility condition is _ violated _ at some eigenvalue , then we conclude that no solution in the form of a puiseux series can exist and we have to search for more general solutions which may contain logarithmic terms .",
    "such a more general series will be of the form of a _",

    "@xcite for this terminology ) : a direct generalization of the form ( [ main2 ] ) [ main4 ] = ^(+_i=1^_j=1^ _ ij^i / s(^)^j / s ) , where @xmath169 is the first k - exponent for which the compatibility condition is not satisfied and @xmath170 as defined above .",
    "the procedure for the calculation of the coefficients in this more general case is the same as before , leading again to the form of the general solution in a suitable neighborhood of the finite - time singularity as a @xmath168-series .",
    "suppose that ( [ dec2 ] ) is an asymptotic solution of the vector field @xmath171 .",
    "we set @xmath172and imagine that an equation of the form @xmath173regards the coefficient @xmath80 of a given balance @xmath174 of the vector field @xmath3 as an equilibrium point of the new system given , in terms of the new variables @xmath175 , by @xmath176where @xmath177 and @xmath178 is the least common multiple of the denominators of the subdominant exponents in the original system .",
    "we call the dynamical system ( [ comp ] ) the _ companion system _ of the original vector field @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the transformation ( [ comp ] ) to the companion system associates a different system of this sort to each one of the balances @xmath118 of the original system provided that any given pair of balances has different dominant exponents @xmath179 .",

    "we therefore reach the interesting conclusion that around the equilibrium point @xmath194 , origin of the companion system ( [ comp ] ) , the eigenvalues of that system are simply @xmath195 ; that is , the dominant exponents of the asymptotic solution of the original system together with the number @xmath178 characterizing the subdominant part of the vector field . moreover , around the equilibrium point @xmath196 of the companion system ( [ comp ] ) , the eigenvalues @xmath197 of the companion system are @xmath198 ; that is , they are precisely the k - exponents of the original system together with the subdominant number @xmath199 .",

    "verify that compatibility at @xmath221 is now satisfied .",
    "repeat whole procedure for each of the other possible decompositions .",
    "note that although the whole spectrum of possible behaviours of the system near a time singularity is concluded once we find valid series expansions corresponding to each balance in each particular decomposition , an additional analysis of the phase space of the companion systems corresponding to each one of the balances of the original system may lead to valuable insights as to the geometric structure of the phase space  _ how the orbits behave _  in the neighborhood of the finite - time singularity .    following the above steps even up to that of calculating a dominant balance in one particular decomposition , can be very useful since it gives you one particular possible asymptotic behaviour of the system near the time singularity . in this respect , the whole method expounded here is truly generic since it helps to decide the generality of any behaviour found in an exact solution  that is , how many arbitrary constants there are in the final solution that shares that behaviour ( particular or general solution ) .",
    "it is rare that a puiseux series is inadequate to describe the dynamics ( semi - simplicity of k ) , but in such uncommon cases one must resort to the more complex logarithmic solutions .",
    "as a concrete example of the above analysis , consider the homogeneous and isotropic frw cosmological equations in general relativity for a perfect fluid of pressure @xmath222 , density @xmath223 and equation of state @xmath224 , where @xmath225 is a constant .",
    "they read @xmath226where @xmath227 is the scale factor , @xmath228 the hubble expansion rate and @xmath16 the constant spatial curvature . setting @xmath229 , this system reads @xmath230with @xmath231and is subject to the integral constraint ( the friedmann equation ) @xmath232this system is weight - homogeneous .",
    "the unique balance is determined by @xmath233and the parameters @xmath234 depend on @xmath225 via eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "since the field is weight - homogeneous ( i.e. , @xmath235 ) , this balance corresponds to an exact , scale - invariant solution of the original system .",
    "note that there is one arbitrary coefficient , and so we expect that one of the k - exponents will be zero . for the vector field",
    "@xmath236 the associated k - matrix , @xmath237 has characteristic equation @xmath238hence the k - exponents are @xmath239we can use the integral constraint ( [ 8 ] ) to get a value for the coefficient @xmath240 .",
    "balancing the terms in ( [ 8 ] ) leads to @xmath241 in the case when all components of the vector @xmath80 are real , the solution @xmath242 of the dynamical system experiences a finite - time singularity .",
    "when @xmath243 , that is when either @xmath244 or @xmath245 , solutions are general ; while , in the range @xmath246 we have only behaviours corresponding to particular solutions of the system .",
    "note that when @xmath247 , we have @xmath248 and we find a behaviour similar to that of dust , but when @xmath249 , @xmath250 the behaviour is that of the standard radiation models .",
    "further , calculating the recursion relations to compute the coefficients of the series expansion term by term , we find the following asymptotic solution for radiation , @xmath251while the dust - dominated expansion is found to be @xmath252    the method that we have described in detail here provides a toolkit for the investigation of the general form of a range of finite - time singularities in general relativistic cosmologies . in particular , the sudden singularities introduced by one of us @xcite , in which @xmath253 and @xmath169 remain finite but @xmath254 and @xmath255 at finite time in situations where no functional relationship is assumed between @xmath256 and @xmath257 , have been widely studied @xcite .",
    "such situations , allow sudden singularities to develop at finite time without violating the strong - energy condition of general relativity and are require less severe conditions than future big rip singularities @xcite with @xmath258 .",
