    "the possibility of an effective negative macroscopic pressure due to a medium constituted from a lattice of cosmic strings , and _ a fortiori _ domain walls , has motivated interest in such structures as the mechanism  @xcite which might account for the observed acceleration of the universe  @xcite .",
    "a crucial issue that arises is whether such structures can be sufficiently rigid to offset the negative pressure , and behave as a stable elastic solid .",
    "a recent investigation  @xcite has shown that a randomly orientated , and thus macroscopically isotropic , distribution of cosmic strings or membranes will indeed be sufficiently rigid if only affine deformations are considered .",
    "it was explained that this should apply in the case where the junctions are of even - type ( x - type or @xmath0-type ) , that is , when an even number of elements ( strings or walls ) meet at each junction .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to initiate a study of the macroscopic elastic properties , and hence the local stability properties , of more realistic models in which the solid is formed from a regular lattice structure , which is naturally anisotropic .",
    "since wall lattices , with @xmath1 in 3 dimensions , are favoured by observations we will concentrate on this possibility , but our methods could equally well be applied to the string case with @xmath2 .",
    "we will consider the cases of wall lattices with triangular , hexagonal and square symmetry in two dimensions , and three dimensional lattices with cubic symmetry which can be created from the wigner - seitz cells of simple cubic , face - centred cubic and body - centred cubic lattices .",
    "the unit cells of these primitive lattices are the simple cube , the rhombic dodecahedron and the truncated octahedron respectively .",
    "the important issue which we need to address is that some of the regular lattices we would like to consider contain junctions that are of odd - type ( an odd number of elements meeting at a junction ) .",
    "y - type junctions of this kind appear in , for example , models with hexagonal symmetry where three walls meet at 120 degrees , and are ubiquitous in three dimensional models . as was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite such models require consideration non - affine deformations to maintain the equilibrium condition at the junction , violating the assumptions of the earlier calculation . typically such non - affine deformations will lead to a reduction in the rigidity when compared to the affine case , making the structures less stable .",
    "in addition to this , it will also be necessary to introduce an extra shear modulus to take into account the anisotropic nature of lattices with square and cubic symmetries .",
    "first , we will establish the general conditions for stability in the isotropic case and cubic cases in general dimensions .",
    "this formalism can then be applied to the cases of triangular and hexagonal symmetry in two dimensions .",
    "it is shown that such systems are effectively isotropic , but that the triangular case is stable , whereas the hexagonal case is not .",
    "we then apply this to simple orthonormal cases of a square in two dimensions and simple cubic system in three dimensions .",
    "we find that such systems are anisotropic and have longitudinal zero modes corresponding to a finite number of specific directions .",
    "we argue that such structures are only unstable to perturbations of infinite extent . finally , we consider wall lattices whose unit cells are the truncated octahedron and the rhombic dodecahedron .",
    "the former is unstable , but the latter is only unstable to transverse zero modes in certain directions .",
    "the formulation of a perfectly elastic solid model is based on a material base space which is the quotient of the spacetime by the congruence of the material worldlines .",
    "the @xmath3-dimensional , time dependent metric induced on this base space is denoted @xmath4 . for the purposes of our discussion it will be sufficient to use models which are characterised by a _ quasi hookean _",
    "equation of state  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the energy density can be expressed in terms of the _ rigidity tensor _ , @xmath5 , as = + ^abcds_abs_cd .[01]the overhead check symbol",
    "is used to indicate quantities which depend only on the value of the conserved number density , @xmath6 .",
    "the quantity @xmath7 is the minimum value taken by the mass - energy density , @xmath8 , for the equivalent value @xmath6 .",
    "it is important to distinguish between @xmath4 and its value @xmath9 in the reference state for which this minimum is attained . a quadratic form , such as ( [ 01 ] ) ,",
    "can be expected to be valid as a realistic approximation for sufficiently small values of the _ constant volume shear tensor _",
    "@xmath10 which is defined by s_ab=12 ( _ ab-_ab ) .[02 ]    the functional dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath6 determines corresponding reference state value of the pressure tensor , @xmath11 , and also of the bulk modulus , @xmath12 .",
    "these are given by p^ab = p^-1 abp = n- , = n , [ 00]in terms of the inverse metric @xmath13 induced on the base space .",
    "the rigidity tensor on the material base space has the following symmetry conditions ^abcd=^(ab)(cd)= ^cdab .[03 ]    the fact that @xmath4 and @xmath14 must have the same determinant ( due to the conservation of volume ) implies that on the @xmath3-dimensional material base the symmetric tensor @xmath10 will have only @xmath15 ( instead of @xmath16 ) independent components , and more specifically that to first order it will be trace free with respect to either the actual metric @xmath4 or the reference metric @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to impose a restriction to completely fix the specification of @xmath17 .",
    "this can be most conveniently achieved  @xcite by requiring that it be trace free with respect to the reference metric ^abcd_cd=0 .[04 ]      we shall be considering systems characterised by the absence of _ compressional distortion _ which means that the only effect of a change in @xmath6 on the reference metric @xmath14 is to multiply it by a simple conformal factor . under these circumstances",
    "the complete elasticity tensor @xmath18 in the reference state will differ from the rigidity tensor @xmath17 by an isotropic contribution determined just by the dependence of the reference density @xmath7 on @xmath6 .",
    "this is given by e^abcd=^abcd+ 2p^-1 c(a ^-1 b)d + ( -p)^-1 ab^-1 cd .[06 ]    this leads to an expression of the form a^abcd=^abcd+^-1 ab^-1 cd - p ^-1 a[b ^-1 c]d , [ 17]for the relativistic hadamard elasticity tensor  @xcite that is needed for the formulation of the characteristic equation governing the propagation of small perturbations .",
    "it follows  @xcite that the characteristic equation for the speed @xmath19 of a mode with polarisation direction @xmath20 propagating in the direction specified by a unit space vector @xmath21 will be given by _",
    "a=0,[18]where q^ab=^acbd_c_d + ^a^b .[20]the eigenmodes of this equation will yield the normal modes of the system and will allow us to establish stability conditions .",
    "a system of the kind we have been considering will evidently reduce to one of simple perfect fluid type if and only if the rigidity tensor @xmath5 is zero , a condition that can be seen to be equivalent to that of vanishing of the scalar rigidity modulus @xmath22 as defined  @xcite by the formula ^2= ^abcd^efgh_ae",
    "_ bf_cg_dh .[09 ]    the normalisation in ( [ 09 ] ) is determined by the requirement of consistency with traditional terminology  @xcite in the ordinary isotropic case , for which usual convention is that the rigidity term in ( [ 01 ] ) should simply be given by ^abcds_abs_cd= ^-1 c(a ^-1 b)d s_abs_cd = s_abs^ab , [ 05 ] so that the corresponding expression for the isotropic rigidity tensor will be ^abcd= 2 ( ^-1 c(a ^-1 b)d- ^-1 ab^-1 cd ) [ 08 ]",
    "this means that the non vanishing cartesian components of the rigidity tensor @xmath17 in ( [ 01 ] ) will just be of three kinds .",

    "are given by _",
    "t^2=(1+w),_l^2=w+2(d-1)d(1+w ) .",
    "we shall be concerned with cases where the medium will consist of a relativistic system of dirac - goto - nambu type branes .",
    "in such a system the reference state can be described by a polytropic equation of state with index @xmath31 , so that p = w , = w , w=-1 , [ 24]where @xmath31 is the ratio of the codimension to the space dimension , so that for the generic p - brane case one obtains = , w= - .[26]this means that both for strings , as characterised by @xmath32 , and walls , as characterised by @xmath33 we shall always have = - , [ 25]for arbitrary space dimension @xmath34 .",
    "thus , in the ordinary 3 dimensional case the bulk modulus will be given by @xmath35 , not only for strings , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , but also for walls , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "in the 2 dimensional case , for which there is no need to distinguish between strings and walls , one will simply have @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "in all these cases , it can be seen that for a system of the isotropic kind characterised by ( [ 08 ] ) the corresponding propagation speeds of transverse and longitudinally polarised perturbation modes will be given by _",

    "this will be satisfied since it was shown that the relevant rigidity modulus will be given for @xmath47 by @xmath50 , and it can easily be verified that an an analogous calculation for the simpler case @xmath49 gives @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , the condition for causal wave propagation is that , + d2(d-1 ) . in cases of present interest with @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    ", it can be seen that the first of these two formula yields the strongest constraint , but this need not be the case for larger values of @xmath3 .",
    "it is clear that these are also satisfied by the model discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite    we should note that we have allowed for the possibility of zero modes in our analysis above , that is , we have classed the cases of @xmath54 and @xmath55 as stable .",
    "this is something which is somewhat delicate and more consideration of that particular context is necessary .",
    "a familiar example of such a mode is provided by the ordinary barotropic perfect fluid , as characterized by a strictly positive bulk modulus , @xmath12 , and vanishing rigidity modulus , @xmath22 . in this case @xmath56 , but @xmath54 .",
    "this indicates that transverse shear modes do not propagate and are not subject to exponential growth . in a non - expanding background , they are subject to unbounded linear growth and therefore can be described as marginally unstable .",
    "however , in an expanding background they are expected to be subjected to either power law growth or decay dependent on the details of the situation .",
    "furthermore , it is worthwhile to reflect on how the existence , in principle , of such marginally unstable modes can be compatible with our everyday experience of the stability of ordinary static fluid states .",
    "the key to the paradox is the realisation that the modes in question are plane waves of infinite extent .",
    "for such an instability to grow , there must exist growing perturbations that are initially confined within a locally bounded support region .",
    "the existence of marginally unstable modes of plane wave type and thus with unbounded support is not always sufficient to provide unstable wave - packet combinations with bounded support .",
    "an example in which there are no exponentially unstable modes , but in which ( unlike the perfect fluid case ) there actually are sufficient marginally unstable plane wave type modes to form growing perturbations with local support is provided by the hexagonal lattice model discussed in the next section . this y - type example is to be contrasted with the x - type cases discussed in subsequent sections , namely the square and cubic lattice models , for which some zero modes do exist but , as in the fluid case , are not enough to give rise to an effective locally supported instability .      the possible anisotropic forms for the rigidity tensor can be classified for @xmath52 and @xmath53 in terms of the bravais lattices  @xcite extensively studied in crystallography .",
    "we will consider here the simplest of these cases , that of the orthonormal type , meaning lattices of simple square type for @xmath49 and lattices of simple cubic type for @xmath47 , not to mention hypercubic types for larger values of @xmath34 that might be worth considering in view of the current interest in higher dimensional cosmological models .",
    "it is well documented in the literature that , due to their symmetry under permutation of the axes , models of this type have non vanishing cartesian components of the rigidity tensor @xmath17 in ( [ 01 ] ) of three kinds , with just two independent rigidity parameters .",
    "we will suggestively designate these parameters as @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "there will be the mixed kind specified by a pair of axes , for example @xmath23 , the crossed kind also specified by a pair of axes , for example @xmath59 and finally the pure kind specified by a single axis , for example @xmath25 .",
    "the requirement ( [ 04 ] ) that the rigidity tensor be trace free implies that the value of a component of the pure type must be given in terms of that of a component of the crossed type by a relation of the form ^_1111=(1-d)^_1122 .[45 ] in order to ensure that they both go over to the ordinary scalar rigidity modulus @xmath22 in the isotropic limit as given by ( [ 14 ] ) the choice of the independent rigidity coefficients @xmath57 and @xmath58 can thus be conveniently fixed by the specifications ^_1212=_t , 1 cm ^_1122=- , 1 cm ^_1111= , [ 15]which entail that the rigidity scalar @xmath22 defined by ( [ 09 ] ) will be given , as a weighted root square mean , by ^2= .",

    "therefore , we have shown that if the rigidity moduli are given by ( [ stmod ] ) then there are non - propagating modes .",
    "we have not shown rigorously that these are the unique points at which there is a zero eigenvalue solution to the characteristic equation , nor have we shown that that there is an negative eigenvalue , and hence an unstable mode below this point .",

    "a particularly instructive  simple , but non - trivial  example is provided by the case of a regular lattice of dirac - nambu - goto type domain wall boundaries separating hexagonal domains in 2 dimensions .",
    "it is illuminating to compare it with the more artificial and technically more trivial case of its dual lattice , the simple triangular lattice .    in both the triangular case , as illustrated in figure 1 , and the hexagonal case , as illustrated in figure 2 , the length and direction of each boundary section is represented by one , or other , of three distinct 2 dimensional vectors , with components @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 which branch off from each other at @xmath90 angles . without loss of generality the space coordinates can be chosen in such a way that in the unperturbed state the first of these is a unit vector negatively oriented along the @xmath91 axis , so that the complete set will be given by b__(0)^a",

    "such a junction between an even number , in this case 6 , of terminating segments can also be described as the crossing of half that number , in this case 3 , uninterrupted boundaries .",
    "it follows that its equilibrium will be preserved by a simple affine linear space deformation .",

    "a regular hexagonal lattice can be constructed by fitting together boundary segments of the same three kinds as in the triangular case .",

    "this shows the surprising result that although duality preserves the isotropic behaviour , it is not so for the stability .",
    "we now turn our attention to orthonormal lattices which in @xmath52 correspond to lattices with square symmetry and in @xmath53 to those with cubic symmetry .",
    "the analysis of such cases is facilitated by the fact that their junctions are of even type  more specifically their walls meet at x type crossovers  which means the effect of a static macroscopically affine deformation can be represented by an affine transformation even at a local mesoscopic level . in particular this",
    "is because the x - type junctions are stable for any opening angle , as opposed to the very specific angle ( @xmath90 ) in the hexagonal case .    to actually evaluate the relevant cartesian rigidity components for the orthonormal lattices , we consider the effect of affine transformations of the general form x^ix^i = x^i+^i _  jx^j , [ 46 ] as specified by a deformation matrix @xmath127 whose symmetrized trace free part , s^i _",
    "j= - , [ 47 ] can be interpreted as the cartesian representation of the shear tensor given by ( [ 02 ] ) .    to evaluate the mixed component , @xmath128 ,",
    "consider the volume conserving simple shear deformation for which the only non vanishing component of the deformation matrix is @xmath129 say , so that the only non vanishing shear components of the corresponding shear matrix will be @xmath130 .",
    "this transformation has no effect on any of the relevant ( originally ) orthonormal basis vectors except the first , whose length will change by an amount @xmath131 , thereby bringing about a fractional change @xmath132 in the mean density . since the effect of the corresponding shear deformation ( [ 47 ] ) , whose only non - vanishing matrix components are @xmath130 will be given according to ( [ 01 ] ) by @xmath133 , the required shear component value can be deduced to be ^_1212= .[50 ]    to evaluate the other independent component , consider the irrotational volume conserving shear deformation for which the only non vanishing components of the deformation matrix are given to quadratic order by @xmath134 , @xmath135 . in this case",
    "there are two ( originally ) orthonormal basis vectors whose length is affected , namely the first , for which @xmath136 , and the second , for which @xmath137 .",
    "the combined effect of these length adjustments evidently cancels out to first order , producing a fractional density change that is given at quadratic order by @xmath138 . in this case",
    "the only non - vanishing shear matrix components will be given to first order by @xmath139 , so the corresponding density change will be given according to ( [ 02 ] ) by @xmath140 .",
    "it follows from ( [ 45 ] ) that the required values can be read out as ^_1111= 1 cm ^_1122= - .[51 ]    the outcome , therefore , is that for a lattice of the orthonormal kind , the rigidity coefficients introduced in ( [ 15 ] ) will be given by _ t=  , 1 cm _",
    "l= .[13]using our earlier analysis ,",
    "it is clear that the longitudinal rigidity is only sufficient for those modes to be a marginally stable .",
    "we can also deduce , the scalar shear modulus = , and the anisotropy parameter is = 12d . for @xmath52 , we have that @xmath141 and @xmath142 , whereas for @xmath53 one can deduce that @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "when used in conjunction with the formula ( [ 25 ] ) for the bulk modulus , it can be seen that the relations ( [ 13 ] ) lead to a dramatic simplification of the matrix @xmath64 in the characteristic equations ( [ 18 ] ) as given by the of the formulae ( [ qii ] ) and ( [ qij ] ) in which most of the terms cancel out , leaving q^_ii=^2__i , 1 cm q^_ij=0 .[63]this implies that the matrix @xmath64 will be of purely diagonal form , which implies that , unlike the isotropic case , the allowed directions of the polarisation eigenvector @xmath145 in ( [ 18 ] ) are independent of the propagation direction , being fixed to coincide with the directions of the preferred orthonormal axes . on the other hand , still unlike what occurs in isotropic cases , the eigenvalues and hence the propagation speed will depend on its direction .    in particular , by substituting ( [ 63 ] ) into ( [ 18 ] )",
    ", it can be seen , for example , that the mode with @xmath145 aligned with the @xmath146 axis will propagate with a value @xmath147 say that will be given by _ _",
    "( i)^2= , [ 64]for @xmath71 where @xmath31 is the relevant polytropic index , which according to ( [ 26 ] ) will be given by @xmath148 for a lattice of cosmic domain walls and by @xmath149 for the other case to which the present analysis applies , namely a lattice of cosmic strings .",
    "in the physically interesting case of domain walls , independent of the dimension we end up with the memorable formula _ _ ( i)^2=^2_i ,",
    "[ 65]which tells us that the velocity ranges up to the speed of light in the limit of propagation orthogonal to the polarisation direction , and down to zero for propagation parallel to the polarisation direction . in the more artificial case of an orthonormal string lattice",
    "the velocity will also range down to zero for propagation parallel to the polarisation direction , but ( except in the 2 dimensional case where the distinction between walls and strings does not arise ) the maximum velocity possible for propagation orthogonal to the polarisation direction will be reduced by a factor @xmath150 .",
    "unlike the highly stable example of the triangular lattice , which according to ( [ 29 ] ) has no zero velocity modes at all , the orthonormal lattices considered here do have some exceptional zero velocity unstable plane wave modes , namely those with an exactly vanishing value of the angle in ( [ 64 ] ) measuring the deviation of the propagation from the relevant preferred axis .",
    "however , as all the neighbouring modes are strictly stable , the occurrence of these exceptional modes is not sufficient for the construction of unstable locally confined perturbations .",
    "the situation in these square and cubic examples is therefore similar to that in an ordinary fluid , which has unconfined linearly unstable shear modes , but is nevertheless effectively stable with respect to perturbations having confined support .",
    "these modes correspond to the kind of global deformation illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]    this contrasts with the effectively unstable case of the hexagonal lattice for which mesoscopically non - affine deviations reduce the energy associated with a macroscopically affine deviation to such an extent that , according to ( [ 41 ] ) it possesses linearly unstable plane wave modes of longitudinally polarised type in all directions .",
    "although such waves are of individually unconfined support , they are sufficiently numerous for their collective superpositions to provide linearly unstable perturbations that are initially confined within a finite region , thereby effectively destroying the stability of the system as a whole .",
    "we have already commented that the anisotropic forms of the elasticity tensor can be classified in 3d by the bravais lattices .",
    "since our ultimate aim is the application to the idea of solid dark energy , it seems sensible to consider the three primitive lattices allowed in 3d which are the wigner - seitz cells of simple cubic ( sc ) , body - centred cubic ( bcc ) and face - centred cubic ( fcc ) lattices .",
    "the polyhedra corresponding to these lattices are the simple cube , already studied in the previous section , the truncated octahedron ( sometimes known as the the tetrakaidecahedron  @xcite ) and the rhombic dodecahedron .",
    "the latter two fall into the class of archimedean solids and are space - filling , as is the former which is a platonic solid .",
    "the truncated octahedron has 14 faces , 6 of which are squares and 8 are hexagons .",
    "the rhombic dodecahedra is a polyhedron with 12 faces each of which is a rhombus .",
    "unfortunately , the analytic techniques applied in the previous sections are intractable in these cases . however , since similar ideas have been studied extensively in the context of soap films , foams and other soft condensed matter  @xcite , a software package , known as the surface evolver  @xcite , has been developed to minimize the surface area of polyhedra of arbitrary topology .",
    "this package , which is publicly available , allows one to accurately compute the energy of minimal energy configurations in an unperturbed state and ones which are subject to a small deformation .    to obtain the rigidity coefficients we select deformations in an analogous fashion to the previous sections .",
    "the mixed component of the rigidity tensor @xmath128 is evaluated by considering the volume conserving simple shear deformation for which the only non vanishing component of the deformation matrix is @xmath129 ; we will denote this def1 in the subsequent discussion .",
    "this will allow us to compute @xmath151 . to evaluate the other independent component , @xmath152",
    ", we consider the irrotational volume conserving shear deformation for which the only non vanishing components of the deformation matrix are given to quadratic order by @xmath134 , @xmath135 ; this will be denoted def2 . in both cases",
    "we compute the fractional energy change @xmath153 for a range of small values of @xmath154 and fit for the coefficient of @xmath155 .",
    "let us first consider a lattice of rhombic dodecahedra in an fcc arrangement as illustrated in fig  [ rd_unpert ] .",
    "the configuration has flat faces and by using surface evolver we find that this is the local minimum energy configuration with this topology .",
    "this structure contains a significant fraction of odd - type junctions as well as some even type junctions which will help to stabilise the system as they will not be required to adjust themselves after an affine transformation - in a system with purely even - type junctions the non - affine correction is zero .",
    "allowing for only affine deformations with of the kind def1 , we find that the fractional change in the mean density is @xmath156 .",
    "subsequent energy minimisation using the surface evolver gives @xmath157 .",
    "using def2 , we find that @xmath158 and @xmath159 for the affine and non - affine cases , respectively .",
    "using these values we find that 0.222,0.167,for this configuration when we take into account non - affine perturbations .",
    "using higher numerical accuracy than the 3 decimal places quoted here , we deduce that it is likely that @xmath160 and @xmath161 although this can only be checked to a particular level of accuracy .",
    "next we consider a lattice of truncated octahedra in bcc arrangement .",
    "this is the configuration which was proposed by lord kelvin as the polyhedron with the lowest surface area for a fixed volume  the so called kelvin problem  @xcite .",
    "although this is now known not to be the absolute minimum  @xcite , it is has been extensively studied in the context of soap films . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ bcc ] , truncated octahedra with flat faces are not the local minimum energy configuration : the minimum has curved faces .    under an affine transformation def1",
    "there is a fractional change in the mean density of @xmath162 for truncated octahedra with flat faces .",
    "a subsequent energy minimisation using the surface evolver allowing for non - affine transformations , reduces the fractional change in the mean density which is given by @xmath163 . for def2 ,",
    "the fractional change in the mean density is @xmath164 for the affine deformation - subsequent vertex readjustment due to energy minimisation reduces this to @xmath165 .",
    "therefore , we find that for the kelvin foam of truncated octahedra the rigidity coefficients are given by 0.183,0.109 .",
    "these values are compatible with previous calculations done in the context of soap films  @xcite .",
    ".the shear moduli computed using for the simple cubic ( sc ) , face - centred cubic lattices and body - centred cubic ( bcc ) lattices . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have tabulated the compute shear moduli for the sc , fcc and bcc cells in table  [ tab : tab1 ] along with the computed scalar shear modulus @xmath166 and the anisotropy @xmath167 .",
    "we see that the value of @xmath166 is lower than the value computed in ref .",
    "@xcite due to the effects of non - affine deformation and also the strong anisotropy present in all cases . using the results derived in section  [ anisostable ]",
    "one can see that the sc and fcc cell structures are conditionally stable with zero modes in each case .",
    "these are longitudinal in the sc cases and transverse in the the fcc case .",
    "moreover we find that the bcc lattice is unstable since @xmath168 .",
    "it is not possible to compute the sound speeds analytically for the fcc and bcc cases as we did for the sc case in the previous section . in fig .",
    "[ allspeeds ] , we have plotted the numerically computed square sound speeds @xmath169 as a function of @xmath170 for all three lattices in an equal area hammer - aitoff projection where @xmath171 . in all three cases",
    "the characteristic four - fold symmetry is evident .",
    "however , there are some interesting differences : for the bcc lattice there is a substantial region of the space @xmath170 for which @xmath172 , confirming the instability already identified ; the sc lattice has @xmath173 at the centre of each of the faces of a cube , whereas the fcc lattice has @xmath173 in directions exemplified by ( [ nonaxial ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have examined the stability of a variety of different lattices both in 2 and 3 dimensions ( some of our results even apply in arbitrary dimension ) .",
    "there are two features which we have investigated which go beyond our earlier analysis  @xcite .",
    "firstly , we have confirmed the physical importance of the distinction between odd type and even type junctions between the relevant wall ( or string ) segments .",
    "it appears that the more odd type junctions a given lattice cell has the less stable it is likely to be .",
    "the other feature which we have highlighted are the effects of anisotropy .",
    "even though the orthonormal lattices contain only even type junctions , the strong anisotropy present in these models is important .    since our main aim was to find a lattice which is stable as a candidate for solid dark energy it is worth discussing progress toward this .",
    "the 3 dimensional configurations which we have investigated are formed from cells based around the simple cube , rhombic dodecahedra and the truncated icosahedron .",
    "these are the primitive bravais lattices with cubic symmetry .",
    "our calculations suggest that we should immediately eliminate the cell based on the truncated octahedron which is exponentially unstable for a wide range of @xmath170 .",
    "this is something of a surprise since it is known at least play a role in the structure of soap films .",
    "however , this highlights an important difference between that field and the one at issue here .",
    "namely the bubbles in soap films have an extra contribution to the bulk modulus due to the air pressure in the bubble , whereas we require that the domain wall lattices exists in vacuum .",
    "we have shown that the rhombic dodecahedral lattice exhibits transverse zero modes .",
    "the question of whether these zero modes are of infinite extent or have local support is more difficult as the junctions are of mixed type .",
    "as there are eight principle directions for which there is a zero mode we conjecture that it is possible to construct a closed path around these directions ( as in the hexagonal case ) . in the hexagonal case",
    "the length scale of this finite mode is comparable to the elementary cell size .",
    "however , due to the existence of the even - type junctions in the rhombic dodecahedron the length scale of the mode may potentially be large in comparison to the elementary cell .",
    "we therefore conclude that this mode will be of larger extent than in the hexagonal case , although this should be tested numerically . indeed ,",
    "as described below , this will be the subject of some future work .",
    "remarkably , the best candidate that we have at present is the simple cubic lattice which has only has unstable modes which are of infinite extent .",
    "these zero modes correspond to there being no specific distance fixed between infinite straight walls with the model based on walls with nambu - goto equation of state . clearly",
    "this issue , along with the precise spatial distribution of the vacua , would need to be addressed by any field theoretical model .",
    "we are presently investigating this issue in an @xmath174 model with cubic anisotropy and the results will be presented in a future publication  @xcite .",
    "one should not take our comments above to reflect pessimism about the solid dark energy scenario ; this analysis is only the beginning of a search for stable configuration .",
    "there are number of possibilities for further investigation : in particular , the other primitive bravais lattices with lower symmetry than cubic and compound structures with cubic symmetry such as the tetrahedral close packing structures .",
    "we plan to investigate these possibilities in future work .",
