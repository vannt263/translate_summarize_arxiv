    "we report on a search for the decay @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this is a lepton - family - number - violating ( lfnv ) decay and , thus , is strictly forbidden in the standard model ( sm ) with massless neutrinos . incorporating massive neutrinos into the sm , which is required by the growing evidence for the lepton family transformations in the neutrino sector@xcite , results in a prediction of lfnv kaon decays at an unobservably low level@xcite .",
    "thus an observation of a lfnv process like the decay @xmath4 would serve as a clear indication of physics beyond the sm .",
    "moreover , extensions of the sm such as extended gauge theories@xcite , technicolor@xcite and supersymmetry@xcite do allow lfnv processes .    a first search for @xmath4 , performed during the 1970s , resulted in an upper limit on the decay s branching ratio ( b ) of @xmath5 ( 90% c.l.)@xcite .",
    "a search for this decay in bnl was initiated by experiment 777 , in which the upper limit @xmath6 was established@xcite .",
    "the data collected in 1995@xcite and 1996@xcite by bnl experiment 865 , a successor to e777 , allows us to lower the combined upper limit to @xmath7 ( 90% c.l.)@xcite .",
    "nevertheless a null search result is usefull since it can either put constraints on the parameters of the existing extension models that allow lfnv or rule them out .",
    "for example , in the extended technicolor model ( etc)@xcite the transition between the leptons of different generations can be mediated by a horizontal etc boson ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the corresponding diagram , shown in fig . 1 is similar to the diagram of the familiar decay @xmath9 . using the assumption that @xmath8 and @xmath10 boson couplings are approximately equal to each other",
    ", one can relate the @xmath8 boson mass , @xmath11 , to the @xmath4 branching ratio@xcite : @xmath12^{1/4}\\ ] ] the quoted limit @xmath13 corresponds to a 65 tev lower limit on the @xmath11 mass scale .",
    "a competitive constraint on the new physics mass scale may be obtained from another lfnv kaon decay , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , for which an upper limit on its branching ratio is set at @xmath16@xcite .",
    "however , the fact that the decay @xmath15 is sensitive to the axial - vector and pseudoscalar ( @xmath17 ) quark transitions , while @xmath4 is sensitive to vector , scalar , and tensor transitions , makes these two processes complementary in the search for new phenomena .",
    "this illustrates the significance of the rare decay searches which can be performed at an easily attainable low energy but at the same time can effectively probe the high mass region .",
    "the analysis outlined here is based on data recorded at the brookhaven alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) during a five month run in 1998 , employing the e865 detector .",
    "to perform a successful search for a rare decay , like the @xmath4 , two basic conditions must be satisfied : first , the parent particle ( @xmath18 ) must be produced in copious amounts and second , the detector must be able both to detect signal and to suppress backgrounds to a level low enough for a signal to be seen .",
    "the first condition was met by employing the high intensity proton source ( ags ) to create the @xmath18 beam . with the projected @xmath4 single event sensitivity of @xmath19 , in order to meet the second condition we designed the e865 detector to have excellent event reconstruction and particle identification ( pid ) capabilities .",
    "the particular requirements for the detector s event reconstruction and pid performance were derived from the careful consideration of the possible backgrounds .",
    "the dominant way to get a @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 from a kaon decay is through the decay chain @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , which has a combined branching ratio of @xmath27 .",
    "the fact that the in - flight pion decays have to happen within the detector and the neutrinos carry off momentum , distorting an event s kinematics , led to the design of a high - resolution momentum analyzing spectrometer which allowed charged particle reconstruction and momentum measurement .",
    "the study of the monte carlo simulated events and off - line event reconstruction ( to be discussed later ) showed that such backgrounds could be suppressed to the level of @xmath28 by applying simple kinematic cuts .",
    "however , the @xmath24 decay would also mimic the @xmath4 if a @xmath29 was misidentified as @xmath22 and @xmath20 was either misidentified as @xmath21 or underwent an in - flight decay ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "another background was caused by rather common kaon decays : @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , with a @xmath20 misidentified as @xmath21 , and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "both decays would mimic @xmath4 if the @xmath34 underwent a dalitz decay ( @xmath35 ) and the @xmath36 was misidentified as a @xmath20 . in the following",
    "we will refer to both decays ( @xmath31 and @xmath33 followed by a dalitz decay of @xmath34 ) as @xmath37 .",
    "the suppression of the @xmath24 and @xmath37 backgrounds required a pid system with abilities to veto @xmath29 ( while still being efficient in identifying @xmath22 ) , veto @xmath36 and to discriminate @xmath21 from @xmath20 .    a detailed description of the apparatus ( see fig .",
    "[ detector ] ) and the beam arrangement is presented elsewhere@xcite . here",
    "we give only a brief overview of the kaon beam and detector elements .",
    "the ags at brookhaven national laboratory served as a source of the primary 25.5 gev / c proton beam , and delivered about 1@xmath38 @xmath39 protons to the kaon production target in a spill of 2.8 s with a cycle time of 5.1 s. before the extraction from the ags , the proton beam was debunched , _",
    "i.e. _ particles were distributed over the circumference of the ring to obtain a uniform beam intensity during the spill .",
    "the extracted beam of protons , hitting a 15 cm long water - cooled copper target with transverse dimensions 5 @xmath38 5 @xmath40 , produced a large variety of particles , but mainly pions , protons and kaons survive .",
    "after the production target , the unseparated secondary beam was momentum selected at 6 gev / c ( @xmath41 ) and was transported to the beginning of the e865 detector through the specially designed 28 m long a2 beam line@xcite .",
    "a major concern during the design of the a2 beam line was the muon halo , produced by kaon and pion decays .",
    "it was greatly suppressed by tight collimation and two foci followed by dipole magnets , which effectively swept momentum - degraded muons out of the acceptance@xcite . during data taking ,",
    "the beam flux in the a2 beam line was estimated to be 2 @xmath38 @xmath42 @xmath18 , 4 @xmath38 @xmath43 @xmath20 , and 2 @xmath38 @xmath43 protons per spill .",
    "the e865 detector was located at the end of the a2 beam line , and its first element was the 5-m long evacuated decay region within which about 6@xmath44 of the entering kaons",
    "downstream of the decay region , a dipole magnet ( d5 ) swept the charged decay products away from the beam , with negative particles going mostly to the left , and positive to the right side of the apparatus . the momentum - analyzing spectrometer consisted of proportional wire chambers ( pwc ) , p1-p4 and a second dipole magnet ( d6 ) , which steered the particles back into the acceptance region of the detector elements located further downstream",
    "the pwcs , each consisting of four wire planes , were desensitized in the region where the beam passed .",
    "this arrangement yielded a momentum resolution of @xmath45 @xmath46 gev / c , where @xmath47 , the momentum of the decay products in gev / c , was typically in the range 0.6 to 3.5 gev / c .",
    "the first part of the pid system consisted of two large atmospheric - pressure erenkov counters ( c1 and c2 ) , located upstream and downstream of the p3 wire chamber .",
    "each counter was separated by a thin membrane into two ( left and right ) parts providing independent particle identification for positive and negative tracks and allowing use of different gases . for the purpose of reducing the possibility of misidentifying a @xmath29 as @xmath22 the left sides ( c1l , c2l )",
    "were filled with a high erenkov threshold gas , hydrogen ( @xmath48 ) , and had a light yield of about 2.3 photoelectrons ( p.e . ) for @xmath22 . to effectively register and veto @xmath36 , the right sides ( c1r , c2r )",
    "were filled with a low - threshold gas , methane ( @xmath49 ) , and had a light yield of about 5.8 p.e . for @xmath36 . in order to reduce beam erenkov radiation in c1r and c2r ,",
    "closed tubes filled with hydrogen gas were placed in the beam region .",
    "the next pid detector element was an electromagnetic calorimeter of the shashlyk design@xcite .",
    "it incorporated 582 modules , 11.4 cm by 11.4 cm by 15 radiation lengths each , assembled in a 30@xmath3820 array with 18 modules in the middle removed for beam passage .",
    "the approximate energy resolution for electrons was 8@xmath44 /@xmath50 .",
    "typical energy deposition of a minimum ionizing particle was 250 mev .",
    "the last pid detector element was a muon detection system , that was located downstream of the calorimeter and consisted of 24 planes of proportional tubes inter - spaced by iron plates .",
    "the plate thickness was 5 cm between the first eight pairs of planes and 10 cm between the last four .",
    "finally , four arrays of scintillator counter hodoscopes , a , b , c and d , were used for triggering purposes .",
    "the hardware trigger , described in detail in@xcite , was designed as a four - level structure with increasing sophistication and response time at each level .",
    "the lowest trigger level ( t0 ) selected events with three charged - particle tracks , one on the left and two on the right side , by requiring at least three coincidences between an a - counter slat and the calorimeter module behind it ( a@xmath51sh ) . by using a programmable matrix lookup unit ( mlu ) , for each combination of coincidences between individual counters on the right ,",
    "only a limited , kinematically acceptable , region on the left was allowed .",
    "the mlu was programmed to maximize the acceptance of the three charged body kaon decays by using simulated @xmath4 events . in order to reduce contamination from decays occurring downstream of the decay region , at least one coincidence on both left and right sides between the d - counter and a@xmath51sh was required as well .",
    "the t0 signal was ready in about 175 ns after the particle hit the a - counter and had a rate of about 2.5 khz .",
    "the next trigger level ( t1 ) used information from the erenkov counters and the muon range telescope for purpose of pid . in the case of @xmath4 the dedicated trigger ( mue )",
    "demanded the presence of an electron and a muon .",
    "consequently , the mue trigger required signals corresponding to at least 0.25 p.e . in both erenkov counters on the left side ( c1l , c2l ) to select @xmath22 and a hit in the muon range telescope ( b - hodoscope ) to be spatially consistent with the a@xmath51sh hit in order to select @xmath21 .",
    "the t1 signal was available about 130 ns after the t0 , and had a rate of about 1.3 khz .",
    "the next trigger level ( t2 ) was designed to discriminate between events with high and low @xmath52 invariant mass .",
    "information from coincident a@xmath51sh hits , and erenkov counters was used to select events consistent with low vertical separation of @xmath53 tracks ( low invariant mass ) .",
    "that trigger was not utilized in the @xmath4 search .",
    "the final trigger level ( t3 ) compared the number of hits in each of the pwc plane with a predetermined likelihood distribution obtained offline .",
    "this trigger rejected a small fraction of events that had either too few or too many pwc hits . during data taking , the average rate of t3 was about 1800 per 2.8 s spill or about 0.6 khz .",
    "in addition to the mue trigger , several prescaled monitor triggers were recorded , e.g. a minimum bias trigger ( tau ) , which required only t0 signal and was dominated by the @xmath24 events , and two triggers sensitive to the @xmath37 events .",
    "the first one ( eeps ) demanded the presence of an @xmath22 and @xmath36 by requiring signals ( at least 0.25 p.e . ) in both erenkov counters on the left and right sides ( c1l , c2l , c1r , c2r ) and was used for pid studies and background estimates .",
    "the second @xmath37 sensitive trigger ( cerenk ) was designed to obtain an unbiased response of the erenkov counters and required only three out of four sides of the erenkov counters ( c1l , c2l , c1r , c2r ) to have signals above 0.25 p.e .    during a five month data taking period in 1998 we recorded a total of 1.3@xmath54 triggers on tape ,",
    "of which 0.3 @xmath54 were mue triggers , successfully reconstructed in the offline analysis .",
    "the process of kinematic reconstruction of an event followed the t0 hardware trigger requirements ( a@xmath51sh ) and started with the `` clump '' finding , _ i.e. _ determining positions of tracks in the calorimeter based on their energy depositions and correlated a - counter hits .",
    "for each `` clump '' found in the calorimeter , a window in the pwc p4 was defined and space points , requiring at least three of the four wire planes in the chamber , were searched for .",
    "likewise , the space points found in p4 determined windows in p3 and so forth . a track was formed if at least three pwcs contributed with a space point .",
    "next , using the measured magnetic field map inside the dipole magnets , the momentum of each track was fit . for events containing at least three reconstructed tracks ,",
    "a fitting algorithm was used to determine the decay vertex position by minimizing the quantity @xmath55 , the r.m.s . of the closest approach of the three charged tracks to the common vertex point . for events containing more than three tracks the combination with the smallest @xmath55",
    "was tagged as the most probable set of track candidates from a kaon decay .",
    "studies of fully reconstructed @xmath24 events showed that the mean value of @xmath55 increased for vertices found further upstream ( lower @xmath56 ) consistent with monte carlo simulations .",
    "the dependence could be fitted with a second order polynomial ( denoted @xmath57 ) . the normalized quantity @xmath58 , which is independent of @xmath56 , was then used to judge the vertex quality in the @xmath4 analysis . as the last step , the information from the pid detectors was assigned to each found track .",
    "basic requirements for @xmath4 included the presence of a three - charged - track vertex within the decay region of an acceptable quality , @xmath59 .",
    "in addition , in order to ensure that reconstructed tracks came from a real kaon decay with all the particles being detected , the reconstructed total momentum vector was tracked back to the production target using the first - order beam - line transfer matrix , and its phase space ( the kaon momentum @xmath60 , the position @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and the direction , @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) was compared to that of the kaon beam .",
    "the five - dimensional phase space of the beam was broken up into three two dimensional distributions : @xmath61 versus @xmath63 , @xmath62 versus @xmath64 and @xmath60 vs @xmath61 .",
    "the properties of the kaon beam were determined from fully reconstructed @xmath24 events and were used as input for a corresponding logarithmic likelihood function @xmath65 ( see figures [ fig : tgtlik ] and [ final_dist ] , and also sec .",
    "[ sec : likelihood ] ) .",
    "the invariant mass @xmath66 , calculated using the daughter particles masses ( @xmath67 @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) and their measured momenta , was required to be consistent with the kaon mass , 493.67 mev , within the resolution , @xmath70 mev for simulated @xmath4 events .",
    "finally we required an unambiguous identification of @xmath22 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "electron pid required a signal ( at least 0.3 p.e . ) in the left sides of both erenkov counters ( c1l , c2l ) with corrected timing within @xmath715 ns .",
    "in addition , the energy loss in the calorimeter ( @xmath72 ) was required to be consistent with the momentum of the track ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath73 the ratio @xmath74 to be between 0.65 and 1.5 .",
    "pions were identified requiring the absence of a signal above 1.2 p.e . on the right sides of the erenkov counters ( c2r , c2r ) and corresponding corrected timing of more than @xmath715 ns .",
    "in addition , energy loss in the calorimeter was required to be consistent with that of a minimum ionizing particle or a hadron shower ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "muons were identified by requiring the absence of a signal above 1.2 p.e . in both erenkov counters ( c1,c2 ) ,",
    "energy deposited in the calorimeter consistent with minimum ionization ( @xmath76450 mev ) and penetration depth in the muon range consistent with its momentum .",
    "table [ tab : pid_pass3_eff ] summarizes the pid efficiencies and probabilities of misidentification achieved by the above mentioned selection cuts@xcite .",
    "although the selection criteria described above provided a high sensitivity for the signal ( respective efficiency of each cut was approximately 95% ) they let a considerable number of background events pass .",

    "as described in section [ sec : tau_total ] , most of the kinematic cuts for the @xmath24 sample selection were also applied to select @xmath4 events and the corresponding efficiencies were the same for both decay modes .",
    "the correction factor was calculated , as a reciprocal of the the product of the selection cut efficiencies specific to the @xmath4 ( see table [ tab : corr_fact ] ) , to be @xmath79 .",
    "the bulk of @xmath78 , 2.17 , is the reciprocal of the product of the @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 pid efficiencies , while the remaining factor of 1.53 results from the specific @xmath4 kinematic cuts .",
