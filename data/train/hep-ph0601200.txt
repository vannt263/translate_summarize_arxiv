    "the main result of  @xcite is a factorisation formula for the bfkl gluon density in @xmath20 dimensions .",
    "if the gluon is initially on - shell , and the ensuing ir singularities are regulated by @xmath36 in the ( unphysical ) running coupling regime _ ( i ) _ mentioned above , then the gluon density at scale @xmath37 factorises in the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the saddle point value of the anomalous dimension variable @xmath40 conjugated to @xmath41 and the factor @xmath42  which is perturbative in @xmath31 and @xmath43  is due to fluctuations around the saddle point .",

    "@xcite on the basis of refs .",
    "the result  ( [ factor ] ) is proven in  @xcite from the fourier representation of the solutions of the nl@xmath1 equation by using a saddle - point method in the limit of small @xmath47 , which singles out @xmath39 as in eq .",

    "let us now make the key observation that  due to the infinite ir evolution down to @xmath48  the exponent in eq .",

    "( [ chi1 ] ) has yet to be extracted from the literature  @xcite .",

    "secondly , the anomalous dimension in the @xmath2-scheme takes contributions from @xmath70 only , namely takes nl@xmath1 corrections too , which however coincide  @xcite with those obtained by the known fluctuation expansion at @xmath52 . ]",
    "@xmath71 and is therefore independent of the kernel properties for @xmath44 . on the other hand , by eqs .",
    "( [ gammamsbar ] ) and ( [ rk ] ) , @xmath72 is related to @xmath73 by the expression @xmath74 whose origin is tied up to the identity  ( [ denomexp ] ) .",
    "indeed , we have separated terms of order @xmath43 or @xmath75 into minimal subtraction and coefficient contributions : therefore , their @xmath41-evolution should cancel out in the @xmath52 limit , which is the content of eq .",
    "( [ gammams ] ) .    using eqs .",
    "( [ gammaq0 ] ) and ( [ gammams ] ) , the well known relations  @xcite for nl@xmath1 anomalous dimensions can be extended to subleading levels , as generated by the @xmath43-expansion .",
    "thus the difference @xmath76 \\;.\\ ] ] is computed up to nnl@xmath1 level as outlined above , even if the dynamical @xmath52 nnl@xmath1 contributions to the @xmath40 s are not investigated here .",
    "we conclude that , while the anomalous dimension in the @xmath2-scheme ( which is roughly a `` maximal '' subtraction one ) only depends on the @xmath52 properties of the bfkl evolution , the @xmath3 coefficient and anomalous dimension both depend on higher orders in the @xmath43-expansion of the kernel eigenvalue , which generate subleading contributions .",
    "the result in eq .",
    "( [ diffanomdim ] ) of  @xcite directly provides the scheme change for the gluon anomalous dimension at nnl@xmath1 level .",
    "a problem exists concerning the magnitude of the scheme change summarized above in the small-@xmath1 region .",
    "in fact , the explicit form of the coefficients @xmath77 , @xmath62 , @xmath65 , @xmath63 exhibit leading pomeron singularities of increasing weight , indicating that a small-@xmath1 resummation is in principle required for the scheme - change too . as a consequence , any resummed evolution model should provide , in principle , information on the corresponding @xmath43-dependence for a rigorous relation to the @xmath3 factorisation scheme , a task which appears to be practically impossible .    in order to circumvent this difficulty",
    ", we remark that @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ r0b ] ) is directly expressed as a function of the variable @xmath40 , and that the leading pomeron singularity occurs because of the saddle point identification @xmath78 .",
    "it is then conceivable that such a singularity will be replaced by a much softer one if the effective anomalous dimension variable becomes @xmath79 at resummed level .",
    "a replacement similar to this one was used in anomalous dimension space in the study of the scheme - change of  @xcite . in our framework",
    ", we are able to ensure in general that @xmath80 is the relevant variable by assuming that the @xmath81 normalisation change occurs in a @xmath0-factorised form , i.e. , by taking the `` ansatz '' @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a properly chosen @xmath40- and @xmath15-dependent coefficient and @xmath84 denotes the unintegrated gluon density in @xmath40-space in the @xmath2-scheme .",
    "the latter is directly provided by the @xmath85 small-@xmath1 bfkl equation , possibly of resummed ( rgi ) type .",
    "it is then clear that , at ll@xmath1 level , @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( [ ktansatz ] ) takes the saddle point value @xmath86 , which therefore should coincide with the expression  ( [ r0 ] ) in order to reproduce eq .",
    "( [ schemerel ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the nl@xmath1 expression  ( [ rk ] ) can be reproduced too , by a properly chosen @xmath87 term in the expression of @xmath83 ; and similarly for further subleading terms in the @xmath15-expansion of @xmath83 .",
    "in other words , eq .",
    "( [ ktansatz ] ) can be made equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ rk ] ) at any degree of accuracy in the logarithmic small-@xmath1 hierarchy , but has the advantage that the effective anomalous dimension is order by order dictated by @xmath88 , possibly in rgi resummed form , and is therefore much smoother than its ll@xmath1 counterpart .    by the argument above , we expect the @xmath15-expansion of the @xmath0-factorized scheme - change  ( [ ktansatz ] ) to be more convergent than  ( [ rk ] ) in the small-@xmath1 region .",
