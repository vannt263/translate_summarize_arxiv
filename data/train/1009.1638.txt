    "diffraction can be described as an exchange of a combination of quarks and gluons carrying the quantum numbers of the vacuum  @xcite .",
    "as no radiation is expected from such an exchange , diffractive processes are characterized by the presence of large rapidity regions not filled with particles ( `` rapidity gaps '' ) .    at the fermilab tevatron collider ,",
    "proton - antiproton collisions have been used to study diffractive interactions in run  i ( 1992 - 1996 ) at an energy of @xmath6  tev and continued in run  ii ( 2003-present ) with new and upgraded detectors at @xmath7  tev .",
    "the goal of the cdf experimental program at the tevatron is to provide results help decipher the qcd nature of hadronic diffractive interactions , and to measure exclusive production rates which could be used to establish the benchmark for exclusive higgs production at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the study of diffraction has been performed by tagging events either with a rapidity gap or with a leading hadron .",
    "the experimental apparatus includes a set of forward detectors@xcite that extend the rapidity  @xcite coverage to the forward region .",
    "the miniplug ( mp ) calorimeters cover the region @xmath8 ; the beam shower counters ( bsc ) surround the beam - pipe at various locations and detect particles in the region @xmath9 ; the roman pot spectrometer ( rps ) tags the leading hadron scattered from the interaction point after losing a fractional momentum approximately in the range @xmath10 .",
    "the gluon and quark content of the interacting partons can be investigated by comparing single diffractive ( sd ) and non diffractive ( nd ) events .",
    "sd events are triggered on a leading anti - proton in the rps and at least one jet , while the nd trigger requires at least one jet in the calorimeters .",
    "the ratio of sd to nd dijet production rates ( @xmath11 ) is proportional to the ratio of the corresponding structure functions ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 , and can be measured as a function of the bjorken scaling variable @xmath14@xcite . in the ratio ,",
    "jet energy corrections approximately cancel out , thus avoiding dependence on monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .",
    "diffractive dijet rates are suppressed by a factor of o(10 ) with respect to expectations based on the proton pdf obtained from diffractive deep inelastic scattering at the hera @xmath15 collider  @xcite .",
    "the sd / nd ratios ( i.e. gap fractions ) of dijets , w , b - quark , @xmath16 production are all approximately 1% , indicating that the suppression factor is the same for all processes and it is related to the gap formation .    in run  ii , the jet @xmath17 spectrum extends to @xmath18  gev , and results are consistent with those of run  i@xcite , hence confirming a breakdown of factorization .",
    "preliminary results indicate that the ratio does not strongly depend on @xmath19 in the range @xmath20  gev@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dsf ] , left ) .",
    "the relative normalization uncertainty cancels out in the ratio , and the results indicate that the @xmath21 evolution , mostly sensitive to the gluon density , is similar for the proton and the pomeron .",

    "i , the cdf experiment measured a diffractive @xmath27 boson event rate @xmath28  ( stat)@xmath29  ( syst)% . combining the @xmath30 measurement with the dijet production event rate ( which takes place both through quarks and gluons ) and with the b - production rate allows the determination of the gluon fraction carried by the pomeron which can be estimated to be @xmath31%  @xcite .    in run  ii , the rps provides an accurate measurement of the fractional energy loss ( @xmath32 ) of the leading hadron ( fig .",

    "the missing transverse energy ( @xmath34 ) is calculated as usual from all calorimeter towers , and the neutrino direction ( i.e. @xmath35 ) is obtained from the comparison between the fractional energy loss measured in the roman pot spectrometer ( @xmath36 ) and the same value estimated from the calorimeters ( @xmath37 ) : @xmath38 . the reconstructed @xmath27 mass ( fig .",
