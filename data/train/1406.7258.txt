    "it is commonly accepted that the parent compounds of the superconducting high-@xmath4 cuprates are antiferromagnetic charge - transfer insulators and that superconductivity emerges upon doping either with holes or electrons.@xcite there are some similarities but also differences between hole- and electron - doped cuprates .",
    "one similarity is that all cuprate superconductors have a perovskite structure with the common feature of square planar copper - oxygen planes separated by rare - earth oxide ( charge - reservoir ) layers . on the other hand ,",
    "they differ in that the hole - doped cuprates have a @xmath7 structure characterized by the presence of apical oxygen above and below the cuo@xmath8 planes , while the electron - doped cuprates have a @xmath3 structure , where two sites are occupied by oxygen : o(1 ) in the cuo@xmath8 planes and o(2 ) within the rare - earth oxide layers , with no apical oxygen located directly above the copper in the cuo@xmath8 plane , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "this implies that the @xmath7 structure has six oxygen atoms , two of which are in the apical positions , surrounding each copper ( octahedrally coordinated ) , while in the @xmath3 structure only four oxygens surround each copper ( square - planar coordinated ) .",
    "there is also a large difference between the phase diagrams of hole- and electron - doped cuprates . whereas the antiferromagnetic phase exists only over a small doping range ( 0  4% ) in hole - doped cuprates , it is more robust in electron - doped cuprates and persists to higher doping levels ( 0  11% ) .",
    "superconductivity occurs in a doping range that is almost five times narrower for electron - doped cuprates ( 11  17% ) as compared to the hole - doped counterparts ( 4  32% ) .",
    "while consensus on the phase diagram exists for the hole - doped side , the situation for the electron - doped cuprates is less obvious .    as early as in 1995 , brinkmann _ _ et al.__@xcite demonstrated that the superconductivity window in pr@xmath9ce@xmath1cuo@xmath10 single crystals can be extended down to a doping level of 4% by a special oxygen reduction and annealing technique .",
    "improved deposition and annealing techniques have recently made it possible to produce thin films of electron - doped parent compounds ( @xmath11cuo@xmath10 , @xmath12 = pr , sm , nd , eu , and gd ) with @xmath3 structure that , in fact , are metallic and superconducting at low temperatures.@xcite    this sharp contradiction to earlier results is explained as being due to the fact that although apical oxygen should not exist in the ideal @xmath3 structure , in practice ( especially in bulk samples ) it is usually not completely removed.@xcite this apical oxygen in the @xmath3 structure acts as a very strong scatterer and pair breaker.@xcite in contrast to bulk samples , the large surface - to - volume ratio of thin films along with their tenuity itself is advantageous in achieving the proper @xmath3 structure with no apical oxygen .",
    "the reported superconductivity in undoped cuprates puts a question mark on the applicability of the charge - transfer - insulator picture to electron - doped cuprates.@xcite remarkably , recent calculations on the basis of a newly developed first - principles method show a radical difference between the parent compounds with @xmath7 and @xmath3 structures.@xcite the first are found to be charge - transfer insulators , while the latter , e.g. , pr@xmath8cuo@xmath13 , are essentially metallic and their apparent insulating nature may originate from magnetic long - range order ( slater transition ) which is competing with the metallic ground state.@xcite    one should note , however , that it is still a question whether or not @xmath3 superconductors are truly undoped or are still doped by possible oxygen vacancies in the @xmath12o layers during the reduction process . since bulk @xmath3-@xmath11cuo@xmath13 superconducting samples have not yet been synthesized , direct measurements of the oxygen distribution are not available so far .",
    "nevertheless , neutron diffraction on nd@xmath9ce@xmath14cuo@xmath15 single crystals shows that it is mostly apical oxygen which is removed during reduction.@xcite the synthesis of bulk samples of a nominally undoped @xmath3-(la , sm)@xmath0cuo@xmath13,@xcite and of heavily underdoped pr@xmath16la@xmath17ce@xmath14cuo@xmath18@xcite gives hope that the oxygen stoichiometry might be determined in the near future for this class of superconductors .     of a mbe - grown @xmath3-pco film [ open ( black ) circles ] together with fits ( lines ) discussed in sec .",

    "[ reflectivity ] and [ conductivity ] that such a normal - state gap is not evident in the current system .",
    "the absence of the normal - state pseudogap is further confirmed by the results presented in fig .",

    "it is evident that the normalized restricted spectral weight displays in all four cases a monotonic temperature dependence .",
    "this rules out the existence of a normal - state pseudogap.@xcite in addition , the optical scattering rate ( see fig .  [ tau ] ) shows ( apart from the low - frequency features due to localization , phonon modes , and mir bands ) no temperature - dependent suppression , that might ( similarly to the hole - doped cuprates ) indicate a pseudo - gap - like feature.@xcite     indicated in the legend.,width=7 ]    thus , we conclude that a pseudogap is absent in the pco films , in contrast to most underdoped high-@xmath4 cuprates . in our view , this difference can be related to the absence of an antiferromagnetic phase in pco.@xcite in electron - doped cuprates , the magnetic order induces the pseudogap . with doping , the neel temperature decreases monotonically leading to a complete suppression of antiferromagnetic order at higher doping accompanied by the disappearance of the pseudogap .",
    "the absence of a pseudogap feature in pco supports ideas , expressed in refs .  , about a strong suppression or even absence of an antiferromagnetic insulating phase in electron - doped cuprates , if the @xmath3 structure ( i.e. , no apical oxygen ) can be managed to survive down to very low or even zero doping levels .",
    "in our broadband investigation of the optical response of thin pco films , we unveiled a low - frequency ( fir ) collective charge excitation attributed to localization effects . as a function of temperature",
    ", the optical spectral weight is redistributed between this mode and the zero - frequency - centered drude peak : the weight of the fir mode grows with temperature at the expense of the drude - peak weight .",
    "such a behavior has been reported in underdoped cuprates and is typical for bad metals .",
    "we found that the optical spectral weight remains temperature - dependent up to 1.9 ev , which indicates strong electron correlations in pco .",
    "we calculated the electron - boson spectral density and found the mass renormalization factor , @xmath88 at @xmath73k .    in the millimeter - wave data",
    ", we directly observed the formation of the superconducting condensate at @xmath118 .",
    "we obtained that the temperature dependence of the london penetration depth at low temperatures follows a quadratic power law .",
    "this indicates @xmath5-wave symmetry which is typical for the cuprates .",
    "neither the experimental optical data nor their analysis reveal any indication of normal - state gap - like features which could be attributed to the existence of a normal - state pseudogap .",
    "this observation is in line with a breakdown of the charge - transfer - insulator picture in pco .",
    "we are very grateful to dr .",
    "hideki yamamoto for his work on sample preparation and for useful discussions .",
    "in this work we measured a thin pco film on top of a substrate . harbecke@xcite studied the optical response of multilayer systems in the most general case , including so - called  coherent \" and  incoherent \" light propagation .",
    "coherent propagation is expected when the optical thickness of a medium is comparable or smaller than the wavelength of light .",
    "our measurements span wavelengths from the far - infrared to the ultraviolet .",
    "the film thickness is of the order of a few hundred angstroms .",
    "we can safely assume coherent propagation throughout the whole measured range .",
    "dealing with the substrate is trickier .",
    "our substrate is 0.5 mm thick . in the far - infrared , light propagates coherently but coherence is gradually lost when moving into the mid - infrared and shorter wavelengths .    to solve this problem , we worked with an unpolished back surface of the substrate .",
    "the roughness of our back surface is of the order of 1050 @xmath6 m , strongly diffusing light of shorter wavelengths . for all that matters ,",
    "light reflected from the back surface will never reach the detector for this range .",
    "a problem might still arise in the far - infrared .",
    "however , we have a highly metallic , hence absorbing , film . the contribution from the back surface of",
    "the substrate becomes negligible as it implies going twice through the film and being partially diffused by the back surface .    in practice , the effective geometry that best describes our system is a thin film ( thickness @xmath5 and complex refraction index @xmath119 ) , where light propagates coherently , sitting on top of a half - infinite substrate having a complex refraction index @xmath120 .",

    "[ reflthinfilm ] to obtain @xmath119 , assuming that we measured the substrate ( @xmath120 ) independently . in practice",
    "this procedure is strongly dependent on initial trial values and does not converge with reasonable accuracy .",

    "we enter this model into eq .",
    "[ reflthinfilm ] , and utilize a least squares fitting to refine its parameters .    the most straightforward modeling for the dielectric function is the drude - lorentz formalism : @xmath128 in eq .",

    "this approach has been successfully utilized in several cuprate thin films and a detailed analysis can be found in santander - syro _ _ et al.__@xcite    however , the use of eq .  [ epsdl ] is model dependent .",
    "we went a step further in our analysis by adapting the procedure proposed to extract optical functions from single crystal data by kuzmenko.@xcite in his approach the reflectivity is roughly fitted by a drude - lorentz dielectric function .",
    "a second step is then taken by choosing a variational dielectric function @xmath135 .",
    "this function is added to @xmath136 and adjusted in order to describe the total reflectivity within data noise . in kuzmenko",
    "s paper , @xmath135 is obtained by setting an arbitrary piece - wise imaginary part ( @xmath137 ) of the dielectric function , and calculating the corresponding real part from kramers - kronig .",
    "this piecewise @xmath137 is obtained by simply setting an arbitrary value at each measured frequency .",
    "this value is modified in a least - squares fit so that the reflectivity is properly adjusted .",
    "kuzmenko showed that this method produces optical functions with an accuracy equivalent to kramers - kronig .    in principle",
    ", kuzmenko s method can be straightforwardly adapted to the case of thin films if one replaces the equation for the normal - incidence reflectivity in bulk materials by eq .",
    "[ epsdl ] .",
    "however , because of the very large spectral range of our data setting an arbitrary value for @xmath138 at each point measured would be impractical .",
    "what we did , instead , was to add a very large number ( of the order of 1000 ) of lorentz oscillators distributed over the regions where the first fit by the drude - lorentz model does not describe properly the data .",
    "we fixed the frequency and width of these oscillators and allowed its intensity to vary .",
    "in particular , we modified the form shown in eq .",
    "[ epsdl ] in order to allow for negative values of the numerator .",

    "the rough @xmath136 gives us an overall idea of the physical excitations in the system .",
    "however , the obtained dielectric function is model - independent and can be used even when the drude - lorentz approach is not expected to work , such as in the superconducting state .",
