    "nonperturbative gauge dynamics present many challenges that are yet to be fully understood .",
    "one of these is the phenomenon of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "a theory with an @xmath1 gauge symmetry and @xmath0 fermions in the fundamental representation has a global chiral symmetry in the massless limit . provided",
    "that @xmath2 this theory is asymptotically free .",
    "close to this threshold the coupling is bounded above due to an infrared fixed point in the beta function . as @xmath0 becomes smaller the fixed point value increases . below a critical value for",
    "@xmath0 the coupling can grow strong enough to break the chiral symmetry down to the vector symmetry : @xmath3 as a result the fermions acquire a dynamical mass , which acts as an order parameter for the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry .",
    "this much is well understood , but the respective parts played by gauge exchanges and instantons in this process still needs clarification .",
    "it has been known for some time that gauge exchanges can generate a dynamical mass . to leading order ( ladder approximation ) in landau",
    "gauge the critical coupling associated with gauge exchange dynamics is @xmath4 assuming a two - loop beta function , one can show that the critical number of flavors , below which dynamical chiral symmetry breaking occurs , is @xcite @xmath5    it is known that instanton @xcite dynamics can also break the chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "attempts to investigate this possibility have been hampered by the presence of an infrared divergence in the integral over the instanton size . in their recent investigation of the critical number of flavors for chiral symmetry breaking via instantons , appelquist and selipsky @xcite avoided the problem of infrared divergences by introducing the following two modifications of the carlitz and creamer gap equation @xcite :    * they introduced a mass dependence for the fermion determinant that is not only valid for the small mass limit @xcite but also for the large mass limit @xcite .",
    "this function simply makes a sharp transition from the small mass behavior to the large mass behavior .",
    "the effect is to introduce a fermion mass scale below which the fermions are integrated out . * in reference",
    "@xcite all couplings in the instanton expression are allowed to run according to the two - loop beta function . for those values of @xmath0 where the beta function has a fixed point",
    "the coupling remains fairly constant until it reaches the fermion mass scale .",
    "fermions are integrated out below the fermion mass scale .",
    "this causes the beta function to revert back to normal asymptotic free running , which gives a suppression of the integrand in the infrared region because of the way it depends on the coupling .",
    "the result of their investigation was that the critical number of flavors for instantons is about @xmath6 . from this",
    "they concluded that the instanton contribution to chiral symmetry breaking is comparable to that of gauge exchanges .",
    "in this paper we reinvestigate chiral symmetry breaking through instantons , but our investigation differs from that of reference @xcite in two essential aspects :    * the recently proposed instanton effective action formalism @xcite is used to determine the conditions under which the symmetric vacuum becomes unstable .",
    "this formalism reproduces the carlitz and creamer gap equation in the small mass limit for @xmath7 .",
    "however , we are not interested in the shape of the mass function , but rather in the critical couplings and the critical number of flavors .",
    "* we concentrate on continuous phase transitions , such as found for chiral symmetry breaking through gauge exchanges .",
    "the effective action formalism makes it clear that the instanton contribution responsible for this type of transition is not the one ",
    "instanton amplitude of figure [ diagramme]a but rather the instanton ",
    "anti - instanton amplitude with two mass insertions , shown in figure [ diagramme]b .",
    "= 6 cm    the latter point needs clarification .",
    "the effective action can be interpreted as an effective potential .",
    "this makes it easier to determine when the stability of the symmetric vacuum is affected by the dynamics . for small couplings the global minimum of the effective potential",
    "is located at the origin , where the order parameter is zero . when the coupling is increased",
    "the global minimum remains at the origin until the coupling crosses the critical value where the phase transition occurs . at this point",
    "the global minimum can either jump discontinuously to a nonzero value of the order parameter , indicating a first order phase transition , or it can move continuously ( though non - analytically ) to a nonzero value of the order parameter , indicating a continuous phase transition . for a first order phase transition a local minimum must develop as the coupling is increased .",
    "this becomes deeper as the coupling is increased further until it is below the minimum at zero and so becomes the global minimum when the coupling crosses the critical value .",
    "a continuous phase transition appears when the global minimum ` rolls ' out of the origin .",
    "this implies that the minimum at the origin must flatten out and become unstable . to investigate first order phase transitions one must be able to analyze the effective potential at arbitrarily large values of the order parameter .",
    "unfortunately the effective potential is not reliable at large values of the order parameter because it is not possible to make a reliable truncation of the series of diagrams in the effective potential for large order parameters . for a continuous phase transition ,",
    "on the other hand , the order parameter would be arbitrarily small close enough to the transition point .",
    "hence , the order parameter can be used as an expansion parameter , allowing one to make reliable truncations of the series of diagrams . for this reason",
    "we restrict ourselves to the investigation of continuous phase transitions .    in a stability analysis for continuous phase transitions the one ",
    "instanton amplitude is irrelevant .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the effective potential consists of terms with positive powers of the order parameter .",
    "near the origin the nondynamical kinetic part of the potential is second order in the order parameter .",
    "hence , to destabilize the potential at the origin the dynamical terms must be of second order or smaller .",
    "terms with higher powers of the order parameter will become insignificant compared to the kinetic term when the order parameter approaches zero .",
    "looking at the one  instanton diagram , shown in figure [ diagramme]a , one sees that this term always comes with as many powers of the order parameter as it takes to close off all the zeromode lines . for @xmath0 flavors",
    "there would be @xmath0 factors of the order parameter .",
    "this means that for @xmath8 the one  instanton term can not compete with the kinetic term near the origin .",
    "the leading contribution to the dynamic part of the potential that is second order in the order parameter is the instanton ",
    "anti - instanton term with two mass insertions shown in figure [ diagramme]b .",
    "therefore only this term is considered in our calculation .",
    "it turns out that this term does not have an infrared problem in our stability analysis .",
    "the main result of our stability analysis is presented in terms of an expression for arbitrary @xmath0 and @xmath9 from which one can compute the critical couplings for chiral symmetry breaking via instantons .",
    "we determine the critical numbers of flavors for @xmath10 and @xmath11 , assuming a two - loop beta function .",
    "numerical values for critical couplings are provided in the fixed point regions of these values of @xmath9 , up to the respective critical numbers of flavors .",
    "these results indicate that the critical couplings for the formation of 2-point functions via instantons are much smaller than those for gauge exchange dynamics when the number of flavors becomes large .",
    "the increasing strength of the instanton dynamics can be understood in terms of the increase in the number of fermion lines of the instanton vertices .",
    "the instanton effective action formalism is briefly reviewed in section [ s_diag ] .",
    "we distinguish between the dynamical and nondynamical terms of the effective action .",
    "section [ nondyn ] addresses the nondynamical terms and the dynamical term is considered in section [ dyn ] .",
    "we present and discussed the results of this calculation in section [ results ] and conclude with a short summary in section [ summary ] .",
    "the 2-point effective action @xcite in the instanton formalism of reference @xcite is given by @xmath12 = { \\rm tr } \\left\\ { \\ln \\left ( s^{-1 } \\right ) \\right\\ } + { \\rm tr } \\left\\ { \\left ( s_m^{-1 } - s^{-1 } \\right ) s \\right\\ } + w_{2pi}[s ] \\label{v4}\\ ] ] where the fermion _ modal propagator _ , @xmath13 , consists of different propagators for the different types of modes associated with an instanton background configuration .",
    "we parameterize the full fermion propagator @xmath14 by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the dynamical mass function .",
    "one can classify the terms of the effective action as either _ dynamical _ or _ nondynamical_. dynamical terms are those that vanish when the coupling is set to zero , while the nondynamical terms are those that remain .",
    "the first two one - loop kinetic terms in ( [ v4 ] ) are nondynamical terms .",
    "they consist of one - loop diagrams that are only composed of the full fermion propagator @xmath14 and the fermion modal propagator , @xmath13 .",

    "the dynamics in this analysis are provided by the instantons and are represented by the instanton vertices : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the inverse bare propagator and the functional derivatives @xmath23 and @xmath24 operate on the zeromode parts of the fermion sources , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the expression for anti - instantons , @xmath20 , differs from the expression in ( [ v7 ] ) only in that the zeromode functions , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , have the opposite helicities .",
    "the coefficient of the instanton vertex is the integrand of the t hooft instanton amplitude @xcite : @xmath29 here @xmath30 is a scale parameter for the size of the instanton and @xmath31 .",
    "the dependence on the gauge coupling in ( [ v8 ] ) is contained in @xmath32 the factor @xmath33 appearing in ( [ v8 ] ) can be incorporated into the exponent part of @xmath34 .",
    "this then leads to one - loop running as a function of @xmath30 for the coupling in the exponent in @xmath34 .",
    "the instanton expression in ( [ v8 ] ) can be computed to higher orders which would cause the coupling in the monomial part of @xmath34 to run as a function of @xmath30 as well , but always at one order less than the coupling in the exponent . to all orders one would expect that both couplings run according to the exact beta function .",
    "hence , assuming that the two - loop beta function is an accurate enough representation of the exact beta function , one can allow both couplings in @xmath34 to run according to the two - loop beta function @xcite .",

    "this step is postponed until after the propagators are connected and unnecessary gauge transformations are cancelled .",

    "the instanton  anti - instanton term that is quadratic in the dynamical mass looks as follows :  each mass insertion closes off two lines of an instanton vertex .",
    "the remaining lines are all connected between the two vertices .",
    "( see figure [ diagramme]b . )",
    "the resulting diagram is expressed as @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 denote the sizes of the two instantons ; the combinatorial factor @xmath71 simply counts the number of terms associated with this diagram ; @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the parts of the expression due to the two mass loops and @xmath74 is the part of the expression due to the remaining fermion loops .      to count the number of terms we start by considering all the possible ways that the propagators can close off the lines of the two instanton vertices to give a diagram with two mass loops .",
    "then we perform the color averaging and add up all the different terms .    recall that each line of an instanton vertex has a specific flavor associated with it .",
    "there is one incoming and one outgoing line for each flavor .",
    "because the propagator is flavor diagonal it must connect lines of the same flavor .",
    "hence , there are @xmath0 distinct ways to connect one of the two mass insertions , each leaving the other mass insertion and the remaining fermion lines with only one way to be connected .",
    "next we perform the averaging over the color orientations of the two respective instantons .",
    "the color orientations are represented by gauge transformations that operate on the zeromodes : @xmath75 in the mass loops they cancel because there we have a @xmath76 and a @xmath77 from the same instanton .",
    "the gauge transformations of the remaining lines can be combined into relative gauge transformations of one instanton with respect to the other : @xmath78 or @xmath79 .",

    "the tensor structures indicate how color indices of the same instanton are interconnected .",

    "the evaluation of all these momentum integrals is too challenging to attempt .",
    "however , we expect that the sizes of the momentum integrals do not differ by more that an @xmath84 factor and that the variations would average out .",
    "therefore we set them all equal and estimate their typical size in section [ glusse ] .",
    "each tensor structure consists of @xmath85 terms because of all the possible permutations of the @xmath81 pairs of fermion lines between the two instantons .",
    "the different tensor structures denote different _ relative _ permutations of one line with respect to the other in the @xmath81 pairs of fermion lines .",
    "all tensor structures that are associated with the same conjugacy class in the permutation group have the same coefficient .",
    "because we assume that the momentum integrals are the same , we only have to add all the coefficients of all the tensor structures multiplied by the number of terms associated with each tensor structure .",
    "it can be shown that for permutations of @xmath81 elements , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the number of group elements in the @xmath88-th conjugacy class of the permutation group and @xmath89 is the coefficient of the tensor structures in that class . to get the total count we have to multiply ( [ v18 ] ) by @xmath0 for the number of ways to connect the mass loops and by @xmath85 for the number of terms in each tensor structure .",
