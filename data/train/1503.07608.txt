    "@xcite and wong  @xcite interpret the oscillations as due to the addition of successive individual partial waves as the energy increases .",
    "the effect is of course most important for identical spin - zero nuclei , because in that case the odd partial waves are totally absent and the relevant energy spacing between successive contributing angular momenta is consequently much larger .",
    "both of these authors discuss this phenomenon in the context of the well - known wong fusion cross section  @xcite derived from the hill - wheeler expression  @xcite for the penetration of a parabolic potential barrier .",

    "our purpose in this paper is to discuss the derivation of the wong cross section  both its smooth and oscillatory terms  and to present some inadequacies of the standard fusion formula that treats the barrier height , position and curvature @xmath3 $ ] as independent of the incident energy @xmath4 and thus , implicitly , independent of the angular momentum @xmath5 .",
    "this re - analysis of the qualities and weaknesses of the wong formula is important in order to be able to distinguish between discrepancies arising from the approximations used in its derivation and those arising from additional physical effects such as entrance - channel couplings or limitations on compound - nucleus formation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we derive the wong cross section and propose an extended formula which takes into account the energy dependence of the barrier parameters .",
    "we show that the effect of the energy dependence is significant , particularly for light heavy - ion systems , and that the generalised formula reproduces well a full quantal calculation . in sec .",

    "are all fixed by the potential parameters .",
    "indeed it is a very general result that the nuclear potential is essentially exponential in the tail , the region in which the coulomb barrier occurs , at least for relatively light systems with low @xmath10 . in that case , all three of the above parameters are determined by two potential parameters , the depth @xmath11 and the surface diffuseness @xmath12 .",
    "we choose to fix these parameters in the following , much more transparent way : for the @xmath13 barrier we have @xmath14 where @xmath7 is the position of the barrier .",

    "we see that once the barrier height @xmath8 is given , the position depends only on the surface diffuseness of the potential , and this also fixes the strength of the nuclear potential .",
    "this is the reason that it is generally sufficient to quote the parameters @xmath23 $ ] in our coupled - channels ( ccfull  @xcite ) calculations .",
    "it is of course also sufficient for simpler optical - model / classical calculations of the fusion cross section .",
    "this procedure is useful because the parameter best determined by the fusion data is @xmath8 , and furthermore there are various prescriptions for obtaining a good theoretical value for this quantity ; for example the bass  @xcite and the akyz - winther  @xcite potentials that give very similar @xmath8 values over a wide range of heavy - ion systems , both yielding @xmath24  mev for the @xmath2c+@xmath2c system mainly discussed in this paper .    as noted above , this reduces the three independent parameters of the wong expression to two , thereby providing a much more rigorous constraint on the physics of the problem , as we shall see below .",

    "the coulomb interaction is relatively small and also the reduced mass @xmath54 is small , therefore the centrifugal potential may play a more important role than the coulomb potential . for heavier systems , on the other hand , the coulomb potential is strong and thus the barrier is rigid against a variation of angular momentum . in that situation ,",
