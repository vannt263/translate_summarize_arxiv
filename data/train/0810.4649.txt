    "in this section , we discuss briefly generalizations of the gram determinant and present a number of open questions and conjectures .",
    "we can generalize our setup by considering @xmath17 , a unit disk with @xmath16 holes , in addition to @xmath5 points , @xmath18 , arranged in a similar way to points in @xmath34 .",
    "for @xmath288 , let @xmath53 be defined in the same way as before .",
    "each paired diagram @xmath53 consists of up to @xmath1 closed curves on the @xmath178-sphere ( @xmath54 ) with @xmath289 holes .",
    "let @xmath57 denote the set of all @xmath289 holes .",
    "we differentiate between the closed curves based on how they partition @xmath57 .",
    "we define a bilinear form by counting the multiplicities of each type of closed curve in the paired diagram . in the case",
    "@xmath290 , we assigned to each paired diagram a corresponding element in a polynomial ring of eight variables , each variable representing a type of closed curve . in the general case ,",
    "the number of types of closed curves is equal to @xmath291 so we can define the gram matrix of the bilinear form for a disk with @xmath16 holes and @xmath5 points with @xmath292 entries , each belonging to a polynomial ring of @xmath293 variables .",
    "we denote this gram matrix by @xmath294 . for @xmath163 and @xmath295 , we can easily write this @xmath296 gram matrix . for purposes of notation ,",
    "let us denote the holes in @xmath297 by @xmath298 , @xmath299 and @xmath300 , and their inversions by @xmath301 , @xmath302 and @xmath303 , respectively .",
    "hence , each closed curve in the surface encloses some subset of @xmath304 .",
    "let @xmath305 denote a curve separating the set of holes @xmath306 from @xmath307 .",
    "we can similarly define @xmath308 and @xmath309 .",
    "the gram matrix is then : @xmath310 it would be tempting to conjecture that the determinant of the above matrix has a straightforward decomposition of the form @xmath311 .",
    "we found that it is the case for the substitution @xmath312 with @xmath313 ( see appendix ) .",
    "however in general , the preliminary calculation suggests that @xmath314 may be an irreducible polynomial .",
    "+ finally , we observe that many results we have proven for @xmath315 holds for general @xmath316 .",
    "for example , @xmath317 and @xmath318 . in the specific case of",
    "@xmath314 we conjecture that the diagonal term is of the form @xmath319 , where @xmath320 and @xmath321 .",
    "section 5 establishes that @xmath322 , but we conjecture that there are many more powers of @xmath31 in @xmath32 . indeed , even in the base case , @xmath323 for @xmath16 up to @xmath324 .",
    "finding the maximal power of @xmath31 in @xmath32 in the general case is an open problem and can be helpful toward computing the full decomposition of @xmath32 .",
    "+ examining the terms of highest degree in @xmath32 , that is , @xmath197 may also yield helpful hints toward the full decomposition .",
    "in particular , we note that : @xmath325    we can conjecture that @xmath326 so it follows that @xmath327 .",
    "we therefore offer the following conjecture :    @xmath328 for @xmath117 .",
    "in addition , we also offer the following conjecture , motivated by observations of @xmath329 and @xmath330 :    let @xmath331 denote the factors of @xmath32 not in @xmath31 , that is , @xmath332 and @xmath333",
    ". then @xmath334 .",
    "[ conjecture 3 ] let , as before , @xmath335 $ ] and @xmath336 be a subgroup of @xmath61 of elements invariant under @xmath337 , and @xmath338 .",
    "similarly , let @xmath339 be a subgroup of @xmath61 composed of elements @xmath340 such that @xmath341 and @xmath342",
    ". then    1 .",
    "@xmath343 , where @xmath344 and @xmath345 .",
    "@xmath346 , where @xmath347 and @xmath348 , and @xmath349 and @xmath350 are irreducible polynomials .",
    "@xmath351 , where @xmath352 and @xmath353 .",
    "notice that if @xmath354 and @xmath355 , then @xmath356 .",
    "we have little confidence in conjecture 3(3 ) .",
    "it is closely , maybe too closely , influenced by the gram determinant of type b ( @xmath357 ) . that is    ( @xcite ) @xmath358 where @xmath359 is the chebyshev polynomial of the first kind : @xmath360 @xmath118 and @xmath361 in the formula , correspond to the trivial and the nontrivial curves in the annulus @xmath362 , respectively .",
