    "understanding the origin and propagation of cosmic rays ( cr ) in the galaxy is an intriguing puzzle which requires the combination of many different observations over a wide range of energies . while simplified propagation models , most noticeably the _ leaky - box _ and the modified slab models , succeeded interpreting the main features of the cr nuclear composition and energy spectra for @xmath2 competing on average to each nucleon within a nucleus with @xmath3 nucleons and energy @xmath4 . ] , more realistic diffusion models are called for to provide a comprehensive description of multi - channel observations ( including heavy nuclei , electrons , @xmath1-rays and antimatter particles ) accounting for the growing amount of available astrophysical data ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "two main approaches have been developed so far : analytical ( or semi - analytical ) diffusion models ( see e.g.  @xcite and ref.s therein ) , which solve the cr transport equation by assuming simplified distributions for the sources and the interstellar gas , and fully numerical diffusion models .",
    "well known recent realizations of those two approaches are respectively the _ two - zone model _ @xcite and the galprop code @xcite . in the case of galprop ,",
    "the adoption of realistic gas and radiation field distributions allows to model also the spectrum and angular distribution of the @xmath1-ray secondary emission .",
    "although these models represent a significant step forward with respect to previous analyses , they still perform a number of simplifications with respect to a more realistic physical scenario .",
    "most noticeably , they assume diffusion to be statistically isotropic and homogenous , i.e.  they adopt the same diffusion coefficient value ( or at most two values in the two - zone model ) all over the propagation volume .",
    "however , such assumptions may not always be justified , as diffusion coefficients generally depend on the regular magnetic field orientation and on the ratio between the regular and chaotic magnetic field energy densities .",
    "although these quantities are poorly known , several observations and theoretical arguments suggest that they are far from being spatially homogeneous in the galaxy ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : diffusion ] for more details ) .",
    "this may have relevant consequences for the cr spatial distribution in the galaxy , for the angular distribution of the secondary @xmath1-ray and neutrino emissions @xcite and to interpret the cr anisotropy .    in order to be able to test some of those effects , as well as to verify previous results which have been derived in the literature under more conventional conditions",
    ", we developed a new numerical code , dragon ( diffusion of cosmic rays in galaxy modelization ) .",
    "dragon is especially designed to account for a spatially in - homogeneous and an - isotropic diffusion coefficient . in its present version",
    "it allow to model cr nuclei transport at energies @xmath5/n as well as the secondary @xmath1-ray and neutrino emission produced by their interaction with the interstellar medium ( ism ) . in this work we disregard cr convection and re - acceleration ( i.e.  we work in a plain diffusion ( pd ) regime ) and",
    "show that most relevant measurements can be reproduced under these conditions .",
    "above @xmath6 we expect that no other physical input than source spectra , diffusion and fragmentation processes can determine secondary / primary ratios , hence a comparison of our prediction with experimental data should allow to fix the slope delta of the diffusion coefficient for some assumed slope of the cr injection spectra ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion about this issue ) .",
    "in our analysis we will mainly refer to measurements of the secondary / primary flux ratios of several nuclear species ( the most relevant are b / c , n / o and sub - fe / fe ) and the antiproton and @xmath7 spectra , performed by several satellite and balloon experiments .    in order to test our code",
    ", we firstly study the conventional case of a uniform diffusion coefficient .",
    "afterwards , we will analyze the previously unconsidered case in which @xmath8 grows exponentially with the distance from the galactic plane ( gp ) and traces the radial distribution of supernova remnants ( snr ) .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : diffusion ] we give several theoretical and observational motivations for considering the effects of in - homogeneous diffusion on the cr distribution .",
    "moreover , we explain why it is worth studying perpendicular , rather than isotropic diffusion . in sec .",
    "[ sec : code ] we describe our numerical model and our main assumptions on several variables entering the cr transport equations .",
    "in particular , we describe our assumed cr source and target gas distributions , and the nuclear cross section models we exploit .",
    "then , we describe our main results on the physics of crs , by studying secondary / primary ratios and individual species spectra in sec .",
    "[ sec : test ] .",
    "we will show that the cr spatial distribution can be significantly affected by in - homogeneous diffusion and discuss how this can have relevant consequence for the solution of the cr gradient problem , as we already argued in @xcite .",
    "although to simulate a detailed map of the @xmath1-ray diffuse emission , suitable to comparison with the one the fermi observatory will soon provide @xcite , is beyond the aims of this work , in sec .",
    "[ sec : gamma ] we will model the longitudinal profile of this emission along the gp showing that under reasonable condition it matches egret measurements . finally , in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusion ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "charged particles diffuse in chaotic magnetic fields due to their scattering onto hydro - magnetic fluctuations .",
    "the presence of a regular component of the magnetic field , which is the case in the milky way , is expected to break isotropy so that spatial diffusion has to be described in terms of a diffusion tensor @xmath9 . according to @xcite this",
    "can be conveniently decomposed as @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the components of the regular magnetic field versor .",
    "the symmetric components @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the diffusion coefficients along and perpendicularly to the regular field @xmath14 , while @xmath15 is the antisymmetric ( hall ) diffusion coefficient which accounts for the drift due to the interplay of @xmath14 and cr density gradient . since @xmath15 is relevant only at very high energies @xmath16 pev ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite ) we will disregard it in the following .",
    "since diffusion is related to magnetic processes , diffusion coefficients depend on the particle rigidity @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , in general @xmath12 and @xmath13 depend differently on @xmath18 and on the strength of hydro - magnetic fluctuations . in the quasi - linear theory ( qlt ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the larmor radius and @xmath21 is the integral of the normalized power spectrum of the turbulent hydromagnetic fluctuation over modes with wavenumber @xmath22 .",
    "a power - law behavior @xmath23 is generally assumed , with @xmath24 for kolmogorov ( kraichnan ) turbulence spectrum implying @xmath25 . in qlt",
    "the perpendicular diffusion coefficient is @xmath26 meaning that diffusion takes place mainly along the regular magnetic field lines .",
    "although qlt may not be applicable to the conditions presents in the ism , more realistic computations @xcite confirmed that expectation founding @xmath27 .",
    "montecarlo simulations of particle propagation in turbulent fields @xcite also found a similar result ( although computation time limits allowed to test it only at energies above @xmath28 ) .",
    "what is most relevant here , however , is the different behavior of @xmath12 and @xmath13 as a function of the turbulent power .",
    "simulations of propagation in strongly turbulent fields agree with qlt predicting @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) decreasing ( increasing ) when @xmath29 increases .",
    "it should be noted that if , as it is generally assumed , the cr source distribution can be approximated to be cylindrically symmetric , and the regular field to be purely azimuthal @xmath30 , parallel diffusion plays no role .",
    "clearly , under this approximation and in the absence of an _ a priori _ criterion to fix the normalization and energy dependence of the diffusion coefficients , the substitution of an isotropic diffusion coefficient with @xmath13 would produce no physical effects .",
    "this conclusion is no more true , however , if the homogeneous diffusion approximation is relaxed and one tries to correlate spatial variations of the relevant diffusion coefficients to those of the hydro - magnetic fluctuation energy density , as @xmath12 and @xmath13 have an opposite behavior as functions of @xmath29 .",
    "observationally , very little is known about the spatial distribution of hydro - magnetic fluctuations in the galaxy .",
    "there are , however , evidences both for a longitude @xcite and latitude dependence of the fluctuation power @xcite . also from a theoretical point of view , @xmath29 is quite unlikely to be uniform as fluctuations are expected to be correlated , via particle - wave resonant scattering , to crs which , in turn , are correlated to the non - uniform source distribution .",
    "a radial variation of the diffusion coefficient may have relevant consequences on the cr spatial distribution in the galactic disk . in @xcite",
    "some of us already pointed out that in - homogeneous diffusion may help reconciling the discrepancy between the rather smooth diffuse @xmath1-ray longitude profile observed by egret @xcite with the quite steep snr ( the most likely cr sources ) radial distribution ( _ cr gradient problem _ ) . that can be understood as a back - reaction effect : a larger cr density nearby sources induces a larger @xmath31 , hence a larger @xmath13 , which in turn implies a faster cr diffusion out of those regions ( note that the effect would be opposite for @xmath32 ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gamma ] we will discuss this effect in more details and show its possible relevance for the @xmath1-ray angular distribution .    concerning the vertical profile of the diffusion coefficient , we assume here @xmath33 this behaviour , which was also adopted in @xcite , naturally leads to a more regular profile of the cr density at large @xmath34 ( see figure [ fig : vert_prof ] ) .",
    "we note , however , that as far as stable secondary nuclei are concerned , replacing an exponentially vertically growing @xmath35 with a uniform one has almost no effects , as expected because spallation takes place mainly in the thin galactic disk where the cr density is only marginally affected by the choice between these two options .     for @xmath36 ( blue , continuos line ) .",
    "in both cases @xmath8 is normalized so to reproduce the b / c ( see section [ sec : test ] ) . ]",
    "it is well known since the pioneering work of ginzburg and syrovatskii @xcite , that in absence of continuos energy losses , re - acceleration and convection , the diffusive transport of stable nuclei in the ism is described by the following equation @xmath37 where @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is the total energy of a nucleus with mass @xmath40 ) is the kinetic energy per nucleon @xmath41 , which is constant during propagation and is practically conserved in fragmentation reactions .",
    "@xmath42 is the velocity of the nucleus in units of the speed of light @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 is the total inelastic cross section onto the ism gas with density @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the production cross - section of a nuclear species @xmath47 by the fragmentation of the @xmath48-th one .",
    "we start the spallation routine from @xmath49 .",
    "we disregard ionization and coulomb energy losses as they are known to be negligible above @xmath50/n .",
    "indeed , we verified with galprop that their contribution to the predicted secondary / primary and antiproton spectra is only a few percent above this energy .",
    "we solve equation ( [ eq : transport ] ) numerically in the stationary limit @xmath51 using a cranck - nicholson scheme @xcite with open boundary conditions .",
    "this corresponds to free escape of crs at the outer limit of the galaxy , defined by @xmath52 and @xmath53 . while @xmath54 is fixed , @xmath53 is set to @xmath55 ( cf .",

    "( [ eq : transport ] ) describes spatial diffusion . as we    discussed above , we assume cylindrical symmetry and that the regular    magnetic field is azimuthally oriented    @xmath56 . under these    conditions",
    "cr diffusion out of the galaxy takes place only    perpendicularly to @xmath57 .",
    "therefore in the following    it is understood that @xmath8 represents in fact the    perpendicular diffusion coefficient @xmath58 .",
    "the    dependence of @xmath8 on the particle rigidity    @xmath18 is ( see e.g.  @xcite )    @xmath59    the function @xmath60 describes a possible radial dependence    of @xmath8 .",
    "we define it to be unity at sun position    @xmath61 so that @xmath62 corresponds to    the local value of the diffusion coefficient at the reference rigidity    @xmath63 gv .",
    "cr sources : :    for the source term we assume the general form    @xmath64    imposing @xmath65 .",
    "while the    exact form of @xmath66 has little influence on the    charged secondary species spectra , it is very important in shaping the    @xmath1-ray angular distribution .",
    "we assume    @xmath67 to trace the snr distribution as modeled in    @xcite on the basis of pulsar and progenitor star surveys @xcite . in    the galactic disk such",
    "a distribution is similar to that adopted in    @xcite , but shows an excess in the galactic bulge due to the    contribution of type - ia sne , not accounted for in @xcite .",
    "both    distributions are significantly more peaked than those empirically    determined @xcite by matching the @xmath1-ray    longitude profile measured by egret @xcite .",
    "+    the injection abundances @xmath68 are tuned so that the    propagated spectra of primary and secondary ( or their ratio ) species    fit the observed ones ( see below ) . even though our code allows to    consider different power - law indexes @xmath69 for the    different nuclear species , in this work we only consider the same    @xmath70 for all species , when not    differently stated . for each value of @xmath71 in    eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff_coeff ] ) the source spectral slope @xmath72    is fixed by the requirement that at high energy    @xmath73/n , at which spallation processes    are almost irrelevant , the equality    @xmath74 is satisfied on earth is    @xmath75    @xcite . ] , in order to match the observed slope .",
    "it is understood that    dragon ( similarly to galprop ) can not account for the local conditions    ( e.g.  enhanced turbulence strength and gas density ) in the vicinity of    the sources , because its limited spatial resolution does not allow to    investigate lengths @xmath76 ( while the    typical source size is @xmath77 ) .",
    "these    effects , however , are unlikely to produce a significant effect on the    cr spectrum , as the mean fraction of the cr path - length spent in those    regions is quite small .",
    "nuclear cross sections : :    as in galprop ( see @xcite and references therein ) the spallation    cross sections and the spallation network are based on a compilation    of experimental data and semi - empirical energy dependent interpolation    formulas as provided e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "target gas : :    the is gas is composed mainly by molecular , atomic and ionized    hydrogen ( respectively , h@xmath78 , hi and hii ) .",
    "although more    realistic distributions are known , for @xmath79    we adopt the same distributions as in galprop , for essentially two    reasons .",
    "first of all , since crs propagate for million years in the    galaxy , in the stationary limit they just probe a smoothed , mean gas    distribution .",
    "secondly , we can have a more direct comparison with    galprop results .",
    "+    however , in the central region of the galaxy , where galprop assumes an    interpolated density , we use the the h@xmath78 and hi    distributions as modeled in @xcite .",
    "while the flux and composition of    charged cr reaching the earth are not sensitive to the central gas    distribution , this choice allows us to better model the    @xmath1-ray emission in the galactic centre ( gc ) region ,    as we will discuss in more details in sec .",

    "in order to test our code , we ran it under similar conditions to those already considered in the literature . in this section",
    "we show the results we obtained assuming that the diffusion coefficient does not depend on the galactocentric radius @xmath80 . as we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : diffusion ] , the adoption of an exponential vertical profile for @xmath8 does not affect significantly the results presented in this section with respect to the case of isotropic and uniform diffusion mostly considered in literature . indeed , passing from a spatially uniform @xmath8 to the profile described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff_coeff ] ) only amounts to a small re - scaling of @xmath62 .    in the following ,",
    "every label indicating a nucleus refers in fact to the sum of all its isotopes , unless otherwise stated .",
    "the boron to carbon ratio ( b / c ) is one of the most useful tracers of cr propagation in the galaxy .",
    "in fact , since boron is entirely secondary , its observed abundance strongly depends on the residence time of primary crs in the galaxy .",
    "moreover , measurements of boron and carbon fluxes are better than those of other secondary / primary ratios , and the b production cross sections from its main primaries ( @xmath81c and @xmath82o ) are known better than for other secondary nuclides .",
    "once the spatial distributions of the cr sources and the ism gas have been chosen , the main parameters determining the b / c in a pd model are the c / o and n / o injection ratios and the quantities @xmath71 , @xmath62 and @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff_coeff ] ) . as it was already shown in several papers ,",
    "secondary / primary ratios for stable species depend on the ratio @xmath84 ( which will be always expressed in units of @xmath85 throughout this paper ) rather than on the two parameters separately .",

    "we compute the former ( which we label @xmath89 ) by comparing our predictions for the c / o and n / o modulated ratios to experimental data over the energy range of our interest .",
    "the latter ( which we label @xmath90 ) is computed comparing our predicted modulated b / c ratio to the observed one .",
    "solar modulation is taken into account here in the  force - field \" approximation using a modulation potential of magnitude @xmath91 . in order to study potential energy dependent effects we consider two different minimum kinetic energies per nucleon @xmath92 for comparison to data : 1 gev / n and 2 gev / n .",
    "the low statistical significance of the data set above this energy prevents us from going further up the energy scale .    for each pair of values ( @xmath93 , @xmath71 ) , we determine the @xmath89 distribution in the space ( c / o , n / o ) scanning over a wide range of c / o and n / o injection ratios .",

    "finally , we analyze the distribution of @xmath90 to obtain our best fit values for @xmath95 with the appropriate confidence regions .",
    "thus , this strategy allows us to fix best values of the c / o and n / o injection ratios and to consistently determine the best propagation parameters that will be used as our best model for the analysis of antiproton and @xmath1-ray fluxes .",
    "we notice here that this procedure , which corresponds essentially to split the whole 4@xmath96 parameter space into two separate ones , is physically motivated by the weak dependence of primary / primary ratios on ( @xmath97 ) .",

    "we use @xmath106 ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : bc ] ) but our results do not change appreciably by using any value in the interval @xmath142 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_const ] we compare our results with egret measurements along the gp for @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "we reasonably reproduce both the normalization and the main features of the observed longitude profile .",
    "smaller structures may only be reproduced using a detailed 3@xmath96 model of gas distribution which we are planning to do in a forthcoming paper .",
    "for comparison , in the same figure we also show the emission profile which we would obtain using a constant @xmath144 for @xmath126 .      as an alternative possibility we explore the case in which the diffusion coefficient traces the radial dependence of the snr distribution as we motivated in sec .",
    "[ sec : diffusion ] . according to the arguments explained in the same section",
    "we expect the cr radial profile to be smoothed with respect to the one obtained in the case of constant diffusion coefficient .",
    "hence , we expect to be able to fit egret longitude profile without fine tuning the parameter @xmath135 .",
    "indeed , this is what we find .",
    "we assume a constant @xmath145 for @xmath126 , while in the bulge ( @xmath146 kpc ) , where physical conditions are much different from the outer disk , we take @xmath147 @xcite . for the diffusion coefficient , we assume that the function @xmath60 , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff_coeff ] ) , is @xmath148 the function @xmath149 describing the radial distribution of the galactic snrs is taken by @xcite and is the same as in @xcite .",
    "a self - consistent model should be developed in order to rigourously determine @xmath60 and the primary cr density @xmath150 accounting for the mutual influence of cr and hydromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "although such an analysis is beyond the aims of this work , a simple estimate can be derived under reasonable physical assumptions .",
    "in particular , we assume that , as observed locally and expected by theoretical reasons , energy equipartition holds between cr and magnetic field fluctuations . under this hypothesis , and restricting our analysis to the galactic disc , we have that the fluctuation strength @xmath151 is proportional to the cr density @xmath152 , and , since equations ( [ eq : dpar ] ) and ( [ eq : dperp ] ) imply @xmath153 , we obtain @xmath154 ( we further simplify the problem by assuming that @xmath155 is constant in @xmath156 , since , as we also pointed out in the previous section , our observables do not depend strongly on the vertical behaviour of @xmath155 ) .",
    "assuming now that the source density is of the form @xmath157 , it is straightforward to show that , in the limit in which radial diffusion can be neglected with respect to the vertical one ( or , in other words , that the diffusion halo radius is much larger than is vertical thickness ) , the stationary limit of the spatial diffusion equation takes the form @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is a constant . this equation can be easily solved by assuming @xmath160 , from which we obtain @xmath161 implying @xmath162 .",
    "of course , this rough estimate can not replace a more detailed self - consistent numerical computation .",
    "it is intriguing , however , that , besides its pedagogical utility , this simple derivation predicts a cr radial distribution which is quite close to what is needed to solve the gradient problem . in figure",
    "[ fig : rad_prof ] we show the radial profile of the proton differential flux at 1 gev for three different values of the parameter @xmath163 : 0,75 , 0.5 and 0 ( the latter corresponds to a radially uniform @xmath8 ) .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath164 a significant flattening of the cr spatial distribution with respect to that of sources has to be expected .    in order to verify if such distributions are compatible with cr measurments , we run dragon under the same conditions discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : test ] but adopting a radially dependent @xmath8 as specified in ( [ eq : tau_def ] ) .",
    "we find that , as long as @xmath165 , we are still able to obtain a good fit of secondary / primary ratios and antiproton data . in particular , we find that for @xmath166 this happens with the same propagation parameters which allow to match observations in the case @xmath167 , in spite of the fact that those values correspond to quite different cr radial distributions .",
    "the degeneracy of the different cr density profiles with respect to cr measurements could be removed by means of @xmath1-ray observations if combined with independent astrophysical measurements of the @xmath135 radial dependence . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_rad ] we show the simulated @xmath1-ray longitude profile as obtained using @xmath162 and @xmath135 taken to be uniform for @xmath126 .",
    "clearly this is quite smoother than the profile obtained under the same conditions but a radially uniform @xmath8 ( @xmath167 )",
    ". a slightly better fit of data can be obtained using @xmath168 , probably indicating that also radial diffusion should be taken into account respect to our semplified analytical model .",
    "the comparison of figures [ fig : gamma_const ] and [ fig : gamma_rad ] displays the degeneracy between the radial dependence of @xmath135 and that of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "it is intriguing , however , that the egret profile may be explained in terms of in - homogeneous diffusion with no need to invoke a tuning of the @xmath135 parameter .",
    "while the actual @xmath1-ray longitude profile is likely to be determined by a combination of the radial dependence of both those quantities , it should be clear from our results that the effect pointed out in this work should be taken into account when interpreting observations of @xmath1-ray diffusion emission of the milky way and of external galaxies .",
    "we modeled cr transport in the galaxy assuming a plain diffusion model .",
    "we study two main cases : in the first one the diffusion coefficient @xmath8 is assumed to be uniform along the galactic plane , while in the second case we consider , for the fist time , a @xmath169 which traces the radial profile of snrs ( which we assume to be the cr sources ) .",
    "the fact that we can consistently reproduce the observed antiproton spectra and the main secondary / primary nuclear ratios for @xmath170/n makes us quite confident of the validity of our approach . by using only the b / c , c / o and n / o data we found that the preferred range ( @xmath123 ) of values of the slope of diffusion coefficient is 0.43 - 0.65 .",
    "the best fit value is @xmath171 .",
    "this is in agreement with findings of other authors .",
    "a kolmogorov spectrum is disfavored and re - acceleration seems to be unnecessary to interpret data above @xmath172/n .",
    "forthcoming experiments like cream @xcite and tracer @xcite for what concerns nuclei and pamela @xcite and ams @xcite for antiprotons may soon allow to strengthen this conclusion by improving both statistics and quality of data .",
    "while in both cases ( uniform and radially dependent @xmath8 ) we obtain substantially the same successful predictions for what concerns nuclei and antiprotons reaching the earth , the corresponding cr primary spatial distributions in the galaxy can be considerably different .",
    "this may have a number of interesting effects , including a possible role in the solution of the problem which plain diffusion models face predicting a too high cr anisotropy above 100 tev .",
    "we focused here on the effects on the expected secondary @xmath1-ray diffuse emission .",
    "we showed that the longitude distribution of that emission can be significantly affected by in - homogeneous diffusion .",
    "in @xcite we already noticed that the effect goes in the right direction to provide a viable solution of the cr gradient problem .",
    "here we provide further theoretical arguments in favour of a radially dependent diffusion coefficient and succeed reproducing egret observations for @xmath173 and @xmath174 for a choice of the relevant diffusion parameters which allow to match the b / c and the antiproton spectrum .",
    "the extension of our predictions to larger latitudes would require to implement in dragon electron propagation ( and losses ) and more detailed gas and radiation distributions which we plan to do in a forthcoming paper .",
