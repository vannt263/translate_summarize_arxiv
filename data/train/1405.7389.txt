    "<S> the supercritical state is currently viewed as uniform on the pressure - temperature phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> supercritical fluids have the dynamic motions of a gas but are able to dissolve materials like a liquid . </S>",
    "<S> they have started to be deployed in many important industrial applications stimulating fundamental theoretical work and development of experimental techniques . here , we have studied local structure of supercritical matter by calculating static structure factor , mean force potential , self - diffusion , first coordination shell number and pair distribution function within very wide temperature ranges . </S>",
    "<S> our results show a monotonic disappearance of medium - range order correlations at elevated temperatures providing direct evidence for structural crossover in the reciprocal and real spaces . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the discovered structural crossover in the reciprocal space is fundamentally inter - related to structural crossover in the real space , granting new unexpected interlinks between operating system properties in the supercritical state . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss an evolution analysis of the local structure and important implications for an experimental detection of structural monotonic transitions in the supercritical matter .        in studies of materials , periodic arrangement of the atoms </S>",
    "<S> plays very crucial role @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this periodicity , and its underlying symmetry , has effects on the formal description of properties such as vibrational frequencies and energy spectra @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> liquids and supercritical fluids are distinguished from solids by their lack of long - range structural order @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> studies of fluids can only focus on the arrangements of neighbouring groups of atoms which define local structure . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , analysis at this level often yields surprising insights into the structure of soft matter and even crystalline materials . </S>",
    "<S> thus local structure is important for a wide range of condensed matter and materials science with the ongoing effort in understanding the local order and thermodynamic properties of disordered matter such as supercritical fluids @xcite , classical @xcite and quantum liquids @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the principal tools in the theoretical study of soft matter is the method of molecular dynamics simulations ( md ) . </S>",
    "<S> this computational method calculates the time dependent behavior of a system . </S>",
    "<S> md simulations provide detailed information on the fluctuations and conformational changes of atoms and molecules . </S>",
    "<S> md is now routinely used to investigate the structure , dynamics and thermodynamics of fluids and other complex materials . </S>",
    "<S> the varying degrees of disorder in complex materials also requires experimental techniques , which go beyond the routine crystallographic structure solutions of bragg scattering which only reveals the average long - range structure . </S>",
    "<S> the use of diffuse scattering to determine the local atomic arrangements gives a key to understanding the behavior of modern complex materials as well as possibly predicting their properties . </S>",
    "<S> current modern techniques are based on the analysis of total scattering patterns , which includes both bragg and diffuse scattering , and provides comprehensive information on the local atomic structure of various materials . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , there has been impressive progress in developing and applying novel experimental techniques .     of simulated one - component lennard - jones ( lj ) </S>",
    "<S> supercritical fluid at different temperatures showing the disappearance of the medium - range order at high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations are performed at constant density . ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     to analyze temperature changes of @xmath0 in more detail ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) , we calculate the heights and positions of the first and second peaks of @xmath0 , and plot these in figure 2 as a function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we observe the steep decrease of both peaks at low temperature ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2c ) , followed by their flattening at high temperature , with the crossover between the two regimes taking place around 1000 k. to make the crossover more visible , in inserts ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) we plot the temperature derivative of the heights and positions of both peaks . </S>",
    "<S> these plots clearly show two regimes corresponding to the fast and slow change of @xmath0 peaks and their positions . </S>",
    "<S> the structural crossover in the supercritical state , now evidenced in the reciprocal space , is the new effect not hitherto anticipated , in view of the currently perceived physical uniformity of the supercritical state .    </S>",
    "<S> the structural crossover is further evidenced by the calculation of mean force potential ( mfp ) , diffusion and first coordination shell characteristic parameters : first shell coordination number , height and their position at different temperatures ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . figure 3 ( evolution of system properties in the real space ) shows the same trend as the figure 2 ( evolution of system properties in the real space ) .    </S>",
    "<S> various methods have been proposed for calculating mfp . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest representation of the mfp is to use the separation @xmath1 between two particles as the reaction coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> the mfp ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a ) is related to the pdf using the following expression for the helmholtz free energy @xcite : @xmath2}$ ] , where @xmath3 is the boltzmann constant . to calculate diffusion we use a standard method , einstein s method , which relates the mean square distance ( msd ) travelled by a certain particle over a certain time interval . at </S>",
    "<S> the limit of observation time goes to infinity , self - diffusion in terms of msd @xcite : @xmath4 ^ 2\\right>$ ] , where @xmath5 is displacement vector of the @xmath6-th atom at @xmath7 time and the term @xmath8 ^ 2 $ ] is the msd .    </S>",
    "<S> although the structural order of a fluid is usually enhanced by isothermal compression or isochoric cooling , a few notable systems show the opposite behaviours . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , increasing density can disrupt the structure of liquid - like fluids , while lowering temperature or strengthening of attractive interactions can weaken the correlations of fluids with short - range attractions . </S>",
    "<S> it is a particularly insightful quantity to study because its contributions from the various coordination shells of the pair distribution function can be readily determined , and it correlates strongly with static structure factor behaviour ( see figs . </S>",
    "<S> 13 ) , which allows it to provide insights into structural crossover operating in the supercritical state .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the relationship between system properties in the real and inverse spaces has always fascinated scientists in condensed matter physics , with the recognition that such a relationship may exist in some classes of systems but not in others . here , we find that not only the supercritical state is physically non - uniform as previously viewed , it is also universally amenable to supporting fundamental interlinks between system behaviour both in the reciprocal and real spaces consistently .    </S>",
    "<S> we now address the origin of structural crossover in the reciprocal space , and relate this origin to the changes of dynamics , thermodynamics and structure of the supercritical state . </S>",
    "<S> it has been confirmed before @xcite , when liquid relaxation time @xmath9 ( the average time between two consecutive atomic jumps at one point in space @xcite ) approaches its minimal value @xmath10 , the debye vibration period , the system loses the ability to support propagating high - frequency shear modes with @xmath11 and behaves like a gas @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when all shear modes are lost , only the longitudinal mode remains in the system , yielding heat capacity at constant volume @xmath12 per particle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result can be easily obtained from the phonon theory of liquids in the classical limit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the discovered structural crossover in the reciprocal space is also closely related to both dynamic and thermodynamic crossovers existing in the supercritical state .    </S>",
    "<S> an easy and elegant way to experimentally determine the structural crossover is to deduce the pair distribution function from a conventional diffraction experiment with neutrons or x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> the use of the structure factor in interpretation of scattering data is particularly valuable since it s directly related to pair distribution function . in diffraction experiment , </S>",
    "<S> energy - resolved measurements gives access to dynamic structure factor , @xmath13.the static structure factor @xmath0 is measured without resolving the energy of x - rays or neutrons and can be written as : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a number density and @xmath16 is a pair distribution function . since the structural crossover of supercritical argon is observed at high temperature ( up to 1500 k ) and high pressure ( up to 5 gpa ) , the use of small sample volumes and sophisticated sample environment ( @xmath17 diamond anvil cells ) is inevitable . </S>",
    "<S> such experiments can only be performed at brightest synchrotron sources or most intense neutron beams . </S>",
    "<S> thus practical significance of this investigation relies on the expectation that structural crossover both in the reciprocal and real spaces can be experimentally observed . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of this crossover has not been hitherto anticipated , and is contrary to how the supercritical state has been viewed until now . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that further theoretical and experimental investigation of fundamental interlinks between structure and dynamics in the supercritical matter can also lead to greater understanding in another condensed matter systems . </S>"
