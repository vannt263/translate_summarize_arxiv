    "during the late phases of stellar evolution of massive stars , electron capture processes on heavy nuclei dominate the time evolution of the lepton - to - baryon ratio ( @xmath0 ) of the core material primarily due to the low entropy of the stellar core but also due to the resulting dominance of heavy nuclei over free nucleons @xcite . inside the iron core of massive stars ,",
    "the electron capture occurs via the gamow - teller , gt@xmath2 , transitions changing protons in the @xmath3 level into neutrons in the @xmath4 levels . on the other hand",
    "the gt@xmath5 strength is responsible for transforming a neutron into a proton ( resulting in positron capture processes ) .",
    "it is conjectured that the electron captures on proton and positron captures on neutron play a very crucial role in the supernovae dynamics @xcite .",
    "due to the weak interaction processes , mainly electron and positron captures onto nuclei and @xmath6-decays of nuclei , the value of @xmath0 for a massive star changes from @xmath7 ( during hydrogen burning ) to roughly @xmath8 ( at the beginning of carbon burning ) and finally to around @xmath9 just before the collapse leading to a supernova explosion @xcite .",
    "the temporal variation of @xmath0 within the core of a massive star has a pivotal role to play in the stellar evolution and a fine - tuning of this parameter at various stages of presupernova evolution is the key to generate an explosion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the electron capture rates is assumed to determine the mass of the core and thus the fate of the shock wave formed by the supernova explosion @xcite .",
    "the calculation of electron and positron capture rates is very sensitive to the distribution of the gt@xmath10 strength functions @xcite . during the early phases of presupernova evolution ,",
    "the electron chemical potential is of the same order of magnitude as the nuclear @xmath11 value and the capture rates are sensitive to the details of the gt@xmath10 strength functions in daughter nuclei @xcite . with proceeding collapse the stellar density increases by orders of magnitude and",
    "the resulting electron chemical potential is significantly higher than the nuclear @xmath11 value and then the capture rates are largely determined by the centroid and the total strength of the gt@xmath10 strength functions .",
    "a microscopic calculation of ground and excited state gt@xmath10 strength functions is the key to reliably estimate the stellar capture rate @xcite .",
    "the positron captures are of great importance at high temperature and low density locations @xcite . in such conditions ,",
    "a rather high concentration of positron can be reached from @xmath12 equilibrium favoring the @xmath13 pairs .",
    "the electron captures on proton and positron captures on neutron are considered important ingredients in the modeling of type ii supernovae @xcite .",
    "the pn - qrpa theory @xcite is an efficient way to microscopically generate gt@xmath10 strength functions which constitute a primary and nontrivial contribution to the weak interaction mediated rates among iron - regime nuclide . in this model",
    "a quasiparticle basis is first constructed with a pairing interaction .",
    "the random phase approximation ( rpa ) equation is then solved with a schematic gt residual interaction .",
    "the pn - qrpa model has been developed by halbleib and sorensen @xcite by generalizing the usual rpa to describe charge - changing transitions of the type @xmath14 .",
    "the model is then extended to deformed nuclei ( using nilsson wave functions @xcite ) by krumlinde and mller @xcite .",
    "extension of the model to treat odd - odd nuclei and transitions from nuclear excited states has been done by muto and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the pn - qrpa is a simple and microscopic model .",
    "the pn - qrpa model has two big advantages for performing weak interaction calculations in stellar matter .",
    "firstly it can handle any arbitrarily heavy system of nucleons since the calculation is performed in a luxurious model space of up to @xmath15 major oscillator shells .",
    "the second advantage is even more important for the calculation of weak interaction rates in stellar environment .",
    "the prevailing temperature of the stellar matter is of the order of a few hundred kilo - electron volts to a few million - electron volts and gt@xmath10 transitions occur not only from nuclear ground state , but also from excited states .",
    "as experimental information about excited state strength functions seems inaccessible , aufderheide @xcite stressed much earlier the need to probe these strength functions theoretically . today",
    "the pn - qrpa theory can be utilized to calculate gt@xmath10 strength distribution of _ all _ excited states of parent nucleus in a microscopic fashion and this feature of the pn - qrpa model greatly enhances the reliability of the calculated rates in stellar matter @xcite . in other words , the pn - qrpa model seems to allow a microscopic state - by - state calculation of all stellar weak rates and the brink hypothesis is not assumed in this model .",
    "brink hypothesis @xcite states that gt strength distribution on excited states is _ identical _ to that from ground state , shifted _ only _ by the excitation energy of the state .",
    "recent calculations have pointed towards the fact that brink hypothesis is not a safe approximation to use for calculation of stellar weak interaction rates @xcite .",
    "recently , weak interaction rates of isotopes of iron , @xmath1fe , have been calculated using the pn - qrpa model @xcite . there , the author reported that the calculated electron capture rates on these iron isotopes were overall in fair agreement with the large - scale shell model ( lssm ) results @xcite .",
    "however , it has been found that the calculated beta decay rates are suppressed by three to five orders of magnitude . in present paper",
    ", we present the fine - grid calculation of stellar electron and positron capture rates for iron - isotopes @xmath1fe using pn - qrpa model .",
    "recently , the improved pn - qrpa calculation has been introduced @xcite , where it was reported that the betterment resulted mainly from the incorporation of measured deformation values for these nuclei . a detailed analysis of the calculated ground and excited state gt@xmath10 strength distributions for @xmath1fe and the capture rates has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . due to",
    "the extreme conditions prevailing in the cores of massive stars , interpolation of calculated rates within large intervals of temperature - density points posed some uncertainty in the values of capture rates for collapse simulators @xcite .",
    "as such the calculation is done on a detailed temperature and density grid pertinent to presupernova and supernova environment and should prove more suitable for running on simulation codes . in present work , a detailed calculation of electron and positron",
    "capture rates on @xmath1fe is being presented for the first time at temperature - density intervals suitable for simulation purposes .",
    "further , we also compare the pn - qrpa capture rates with previous key calculations for the astrophysically important range of stellar temperatures and densities .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the presence of @xmath1fe in the stellar core is a result of the last phase of silicon burning .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec:2 ] briefly discusses the formalism of the pn - qrpa calculations . in section [ sec:3 ] ,",
    "the calculated results are present .",
    "comparison with earlier calculations during presupernova evolution of massive stars is also included in this section .",
    "we summarize the main conclusions in section [ sec:4 ] .",
    "the fine - grid calculation of the stellar electron and positron capture rates on @xmath1fe is presented in table  [ tab.1 ] .",
    "the electron capture ( ec ) and positron capture ( pc ) rates of a transition from the @xmath16-th state of the parent to the @xmath17-th state of the daughter nucleus is given by @xmath18\\left[f_{ij } ( t,\\rho , e_{f } ) \\right]\\left[b(f)_{ij } + \\left({\\raise0.7ex\\hbox{$ g_{a }   $ } \\!\\mathord{\\left/ { \\vphantom { g_{a }   g_{v } } } \\right .",

    "one are the phonon transitions , where the odd quasiparticle acts as spectator and the other is the transitions of the odd quasiparticle itself . in the later case phonon correlations have been introduced to one - quasiparticle states in first - order perturbation @xcite .",
    "the functions @xmath22 give the phase space integrals .",
    "details of the calculations of phase space integrals and reduced transition probabilities in the pn - qrpa model can be found in refs .",

    "the pn - qrpa theory allows a microscopic state - by - state calculation of both sums present in eq .",

    "as discussed earlier in previous section , this feature of the pn - qrpa model greatly increases the reliability of the calculated rates in stellar matter where there exists a finite probability of occupation of excited states .    in order to further increase the reliability of the calculated capture rates experimental data were incorporated in the calculation wherever possible .",
    "in addition to the incorporation of the experimentally adopted value of the deformation parameter , the calculated excitation energies ( along with their log @xmath25 values ) were replaced with an experimental one when they were within 0.5 mev of each other .",
    "the calculation presented in this work takes into consideration certain aspects .",
    "the missing measured states are inserted and inverse and mirror transitions are also taken into account .",
    "no theoretical levels have been replaced with the experimental ones beyond the excitation energy for which experimental compilations had no definite spin and/or parity .",

    "the use of a separable interaction assisted in the incorporation of a luxurious model space of up to @xmath15 major oscillator shells which in turn made possible to consider these many excited states both in parent and daughter nucleus .",
    "recently , the deformation parameter is being argued as an important parameter for qrpa calculations _ at par _ with the pairing parameter by stetcu and johnson @xcite .",
    "as such rather than using deformations from some theoretical mass model ( as used in earlier calculations of pn - qrpa rates e.g. @xcite ) , the experimentally adopted value of the deformation parameters for @xmath20fe , extracted by relating the measured energy of the first @xmath33 excited state with the quadrupole deformation , has been taken from raman _",

    "a detailed comparison of reported capture rates with previous calculations over a wide range of temperature and density has been presented earlier @xcite . here",
    ", we would like to present how the reported rates compare with previous calculations during temperature and density domains of astrophysical interest .",
    "for the sake of comparison , we took into consideration the pioneer calculations of ffn @xcite , those performed using the large - scale shell model ( lssm ) @xcite and the recently reported thermal qrpa ( tqrpa ) approach @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the contribution of excited states to the total capture rates for these iron isotopes was performed earlier by nabi @xcite .",
    "there , it was shown that the electron capture rates have a significant contribution from parent excited states for the case of @xmath27fe .",
    "the total capture rate is dominated by ground state contribution alone for the case of @xmath21fe and the case of @xmath30fe had a @xmath51-@xmath51 contribution . whenever ground state and low - lying states ( @xmath52 1 mev ) dominate the total capture rates the microscopic calculations of pn - qrpa and lssm are found to be in very good agreement .",
    "figure  [ figure1 ] depicts the comparison of electron capture rates on @xmath27fe with lssm and ffn calculations .",
    "the graph is drawn for temperature and density domain of astrophysical importance ( oxygen shell burning and silicon core burning phases ) for the case of @xmath27fe .",
    "the upper panel displays the ratio of calculated rates to the lssm rates , @xmath53(qrpa / lssm ) , while the lower panel shows a similar comparison with the ffn calculation , @xmath53(qrpa / ffn ) . at lower stellar temperatures and densities the calculated electron capture rates are bigger than the corresponding lssm rates by as much as a factor of four .",
    "the results agree at high temperatures and densities . during the early stages of the collapse",
    "the capture rates are very sensitive to the excited gt@xmath2 strength distributions .",
    "it is reminded that lssm approach allows for detailed nuclear spectroscopy but partially employs the brink hypothesis .",
    "the pn - qrpa model , on the other hand , performs a microscopic calculation of all low - lying gt@xmath2 strength distributions . at high densities the capture rates depend more on the centroid and total strength of the gt@xmath2 functions .",
    "it was shown in table 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite that the pn - qrpa calculated the centroid at a slightly higher energy in daughter @xmath27mn nucleus as against lssm centroid .",
    "but the effect was compensated by the calculation of a much higher total strength value as compared to lssm strength .",
    "accordingly the two results match well at high densities .",
    "the ffn electron capture rates are on the average bigger by an order of magnitude ( lower panel of figure  [ figure1 ] ) as compared to pn - qrpa rates .",
    "there are two main reasons for this enhancement in ffn rates .",
    "firstly ffn did not take into consideration the quenching of the gt strength .",
    "ffn also did not take into effect the process of particle emission from excited states and accordingly their parent excitation energies extended well beyond the particle decay channel .",
    "for these reasons ffn rates were also bigger than lssm rates by around an order of magnitude .",
    "the electron capture rates on @xmath21fe are argued to be most effective during the oxygen shell burning till around the ignition of the first stage of convective silicon shell burning of massive stars . figure  [ figure2 ] depicts the comparison of the calculated electron capture rates on @xmath21fe with lssm ( upper panel ) and ffn ( lower panel ) calculations for the corresponding physical conditions . the upper panel shows a very good comparison of pn - qrpa and lssm rates ( within a factor of @xmath54 ) .",
    "primarily the ground state but also a few low - lying excited gt@xmath2 strength distributions play a key role in the calculation of total capture rates for this odd - a nucleus .",
    "lssm performs a microscopic calculation of these low - lying strength functions ( up to around @xmath7 mev ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier the ground state gt@xmath2 strength function dominates the total capture rates on @xmath21fe and the two calculations agree very well .",
    "the ffn rates are again bigger by an order of magnitude at high temperatures .",
    "the probability of occupation of high - lying excited states increases with stellar temperature and ffn rates are much bigger for reasons given above .",
    "the comparison of electron capture rates on @xmath30fe with previous calculations is shown in figure  [ figure3 ] .",
    "the capture rates on this isotope are very important for the pre - supernova phase of massive stars . as such figure  [ figure3 ] shows the comparison up to @xmath55 = 30 $ ] and @xmath56 = 10^{9}$ ] .",
    "once again the comparison between pn - qrpa and lssm is very good ( for reasons mentioned earlier ) .",
    "ffn rates are again bigger for obvious reasons .",
    "there are two key facts to keep in mind before we present a comparison of positron capture rates for @xmath1fe .",
    "first , of all it is to be noted that positron capture rates are tens of orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding electron capture rates . secondly , these small numbers are fragile functions of the available phase space and can change appreciably by a mere change of @xmath8 mev in phase space calculations .",
    "the positron capture rates are more indicative of the uncertainties in calculation of the energy eigenvalues ( for both parent and daughter states ) .",
    "further it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the ground state rate contributed at the maximum by only about @xmath57 to the total positron capture rates .",
    "figure  [ figure4 ] shows the comparison of the calculated positron capture rates on @xmath27fe with the lssm and ffn calculation for similar physical conditions as depicted in figure  [ figure1 ] .",
    "here one sees that the pn - qrpa rates are suppressed by up to five orders of magnitude at low temperatures .",
    "the comparison improves as temperature increases .",
    "the comparison is similar in both upper and lower panels and does not change by increasing density by two orders of magnitude ( from @xmath58 = 10^{6}$ ] to @xmath56 = 10^{8}$ ] ) .",
    "the comparison between pn - qrpa and lssm improves for the case of @xmath21fe ( figure  [ figure5 ] ) where the rates differ at the maximum by three orders of magnitude .",
    "the positron capture rates are in very good agreement with lssm rates at high temperatures .",
    "still better is the comparison case for @xmath30fe ( figure  [ figure6 ] ) .",
    "the ffn rates are bigger by up to four orders of magnitude .",
    "recently dzhioev and collaborators @xcite applied the pn - qrpa model extended to finite temperature by the thermofield dynamics formalism ( referred to as tqrpa ) and calculated electron capture rates on @xmath20fe .",
    "it was reported by the authors that tqrpa and lssm results matched well at low temperatures and high densities . at high temperatures",
    "the tqrpa rates were bigger than lssm electron capture rates .",
    "table  [ tab.2 ] presents a mutual comparison between pn - qrpa , tqrpa and lssm electron capture rates on these even - even isotopes of iron .",
    "it can be seen from table  [ tab.2 ] that tqrpa electron capture rates on @xmath27fe are smaller by two ( six ) orders of magnitude at @xmath55 = 1 $ ] and @xmath59 = 10^{7 } ( 10^{8})$ ] as compared to pn - qrpa and lssm rates .",
    "the comparison improves as temperature and density increase and tqrpa rates are doubled at @xmath55 = 10 $ ] .",
    "as far as comparison of electron capture rates on @xmath30fe is concerned , one again notes that tqrpa rates are smaller by up to seven orders of magnitude at low temperatures and densities .",
    "however by merely changing @xmath55 = 1 $ ] to @xmath55 = 1.5 $ ] the tqrpa rates gets up to @xmath60 orders of magnitude bigger than the corresponding pn - qrpa and lssm rates .",
    "it looks that tqrpa rates are very sensitive to temperature changes for the case of @xmath30fe at low densities .",
    "the comparison improves with increasing stellar temperatures and densities . once again at @xmath55 = 10 $ ] the tqrpa rates are roughly double the pn - qrpa and lssm rates .",
    "table  [ tab.2 ] shows that the comparison between pn - qrpa and lssm is comparatively far better and that tqrpa model requires further refinement .",
    "precise and reliable nuclear data can lead to deciphering the elemental and isotopic abundances in nature with more confidence and thereby derive meaningful constraints on the associated astrophysical models .",
    "the pn - qrpa model has a good track record of calculation of weak interaction rates both in terrestrial and stellar domains .",
    "the model has access to a huge model space making it possible to calculate weak rates for arbitrarily heavy system of nucleons .",
    "further the model gets rid of the brink hypothesis and calculates a _ state - by - state _ calculation of stellar capture rates which greatly increases the reliability of calculated rates .",
    "incorporation of experimental deformation lead to a much improved version of this calculation .",
    "the model was used recently to calculate weak interaction mediated rates on iron isotopes , @xmath1fe @xcite .",
    "electron capture on these isotopes of iron are mainly responsible for decreasing the electron - to - baryon ratio during the oxygen and silicon burning phases of massive stars .",
    "the corresponding positron capture rates are orders of magnitude smaller and accordingly less important for late stellar evolution of massive stars .",
    "the calculated electron and positron capture rates are also compared against previous key calculations of weak rates . during the oxygen and silicon core burning phase of massive stars , the pn - qrpa electron capture rates on @xmath27fe are around three times bigger than those calculated by lssm .",
    "the comparison is very good for the case of @xmath61fe .",
    "ffn electron capture rates are bigger by an order of magnitude .",
    "orders of magnitude differences in electron capture rates exist between tqrpa and lssm / pn - qrpa model .",
    "the former calculations of positron capture rates on @xmath1fe are @xmath62-@xmath63 orders of magnitude bigger than the pn - qrpa rates . the lssm positron capture rates on @xmath30fe is in good agreement with reported rates .    the main idea of reporting",
    "this work is to present a fine - grid calculation of electron and positron capture rates on @xmath1fe in stellar matter .",
    "such tables ( e.g. table ii of ref .",
    "@xcite ) are of great utility for core - collapse simulators and also suitable for interpolation purposes .",
    "the fine - grid calculation is presented in table  [ tab.1 ] .",
    "the ascii file of this table can also be requested from the author .",
    "core - collapse simulators are encouraged to employ these rates in simulation codes to check for possible interesting outcomes .",
