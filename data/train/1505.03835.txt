    "over the past decade , with the development of the technique of the optical lattices , one could manipulate cold atoms in the periodic potentials , which serve as an ideal platform to explore various many - body models in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "as one of the important fundamental models in many - body physics , the bose - hubbard model(bhm ) has attracted lots of attention since it was first introduced in 1963 @xcite . in the single component bhm , there exists a quantum phase transition between the mott insulator(mi ) phase and the superfluid ( sf ) phase @xcite .",
    "this transition has been explored in recent cold atom experiments @xcite . when this is extended to two components of bosonic modes ,",
    "the phase diagram becomes more complicated correspondingly @xcite .",
    "the standard single - component bhm only includes the on - site repulsive interaction @xmath0 and the tunnelling @xmath1 between nearest neighbours .",
    "the interaction term favors the mi phase in which each site hosts a definite number of particles ; whereas the tunnelling term favors the superfluid phase where the particles are delocalized .",
    "the competition between these two terms drives a quantum phase transition between these two phases .",
    "for the two - component bhm , besides the intra - species interaction @xmath2 and the tunnelling @xmath3 for each component ( where @xmath4 labels the components ) , there is the additional inter - species interaction between the two components @xcite . in recent years , a lot of attention has been paid to the extended single ( two or more ) component bhm , and one kind of the extended bhm has additional tunnelling between the next - nearest neighbours or long range interactions @xcite , while another kind has additional nonlinear coupling between different components @xcite .",
    "expectedly , these additional terms in the extended bhm give rise to a more complicated phase diagram @xcite .    in a previous work @xcite , we investigated a system of two - component polariton confined in a single optical microcavity .",
    "polariton is a kind of bosonic quasiparticle in the light - matter system , and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of microcavity polaritons have been realized in experiment recently @xcite . in this model , in addition to the density - density interaction ( kerr nonlinearity ) , there also exist two types of nonlinear coupling between the polariton components . in the current work ,",
    "we extend this model by consider a one dimensional array of such a cavity polariton system , which realizes a two - component bhm .",
    "we will calculate the phase diagram of the system and focus on how the inter - species interactions and the nonlinear coupling terms will affect the transition between the mi phase and the sf phase .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  ii we present the model hamiltonian that describes an extended two - component bose - hubbard model . in sec .",
    "iii , we provide the ground state phase diagram obtained from the mean - field decoupling approach . to gain futher insights and examine the effects of different terms in the hamiltonian , we present a perturbative analysis in sec .",

    "the presence of @xmath138-term will also lower the energies of even mi states , but the energy shift is quadractic in @xmath138 as the unperturbed even mi states are nondegenerate .",
    "this explains the appearance of odd mi regions with @xmath89 for @xmath196 .",
    "there is no mi region for @xmath197 , because transition matrix element between fock states @xmath198 and @xmath105 vanishes .",
    "in addition , it is not difficult to show that the width of the odd mi region on the @xmath52-axis is * @xmath199 * , which grows when @xmath193 increases , in good agreement with the numerical results .",
    "actually , no matter @xmath0 is zero or not , we can always use the above picture , i.e. , first order energy shift to the state with degeneracy and second order energy shift to the state without degeneracy , to understand the effect of @xmath138 . and",
    "it also applies to the situation even @xmath72 .",
    "as mentioned previously , the ground states with odd occupations are doubly degenerate when @xmath72 , @xmath153 at @xmath56 , and @xmath138 has nonvanishing matrix elements between them which can induce a first order energy shift . at the same time , the energy shift is second order in the even occupation case . on the other hand , the tunneling energy grows as @xmath138 increases .",
    "therefore , the  even - odd effect \" disappears in fig .",
    "[ figphase](f ) .",
    "finally , let us consider the effect of the @xmath118-term . in the case @xmath170 and @xmath86 , the @xmath118-term alone would not induce odd mi regions .",
    "this is due to the fact that , unlike the @xmath138-term , this term does not induce a direct coupling between @xmath179 and @xmath180 states , i.e. , the corresponding matrix element vanishes . hence a small @xmath118 does not have any noticeable effects on the phase diagram .",
    "however , the @xmath118-term can be regarded as a nonlinear coupling between the two components of the polariton , whose effective sign depends on the population difference . as a result , in the superfluid region , when the relative population @xmath200 changes sign , the relative phase between the two order parameters @xmath201 and @xmath202 will change from 0 to @xmath167 . as",
    "this effect is already present in the single - cavity system which we investigated in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , we do not provide a detailed discussion here .",
    "instead , we just present the phase diagram for the superfluid region in fig .",
    "[ figpd ] , in which 0sf and @xmath167sf are superfluid phases with relative phase between @xmath201 and @xmath202 being 0 and @xmath167 , respectively .",

    "the perturbation calculation presented above allows us to better understand the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ figphase ] .",
    "in particular , we can now explain why the inter - species interaction give rise to the even - odd effect , and how the nonlinear coupling term @xmath138 weakens the even - odd effect .",
    "so far we have investigated a homogeneous system of inter - connected cavity in 1d using a mean - field approach . in this part , the exact diagonalization method is used to study this model . to make the calculation manageable",
    ", we consider a finite number , @xmath205 , cavities with @xmath206 total particles .",
    "the whole hilbert space are spanned by the fock state basis @xmath207 where @xmath208 denotes the number of polaritons in component-@xmath64 in @xmath209th cavity , and they are constrained as @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "the dimension of the hilbert space is therefore @xmath212 .",
    "we write the hamiltonian into a matrix form under this fock state basis using the periodic boundary condition , and obtain the ground state ( @xmath213 ) of this large sparse matrix through exact diagonalization . in fig .",
    "[ figed ] , we plot the total number fluctuation per cavity which is defined as @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the total number operator for @xmath209th cavity . under the periodic boundary condition , this quantity is indepedent of the cavity index @xmath209 .",
    "we vary @xmath206 and @xmath205 to some extent while restricting their ratio @xmath216 ( i.e. , the number of polaritons per cavity ) to be 1 , 2 , or 3 . as can be seen , the behavior of the number fluctuation is sensitive to @xmath216",

    "one can see that in the limit @xmath217 , the number fluctuation for systems with @xmath218 remains finite , which indicates the lack of mi region for @xmath197 .",
    "by contrast , in the same limit , the number fluctuations for @xmath219 and 3 vanish and more specifically @xmath220 for @xmath221 tends to zero with a much steeper slope .",
    "we thus expect to see a large mi region for @xmath222 and a small mi region for @xmath223 .",

    "additionally , the competition between the nonlinear coupling strengths @xmath138 and @xmath118 can drive a first order quantum phase transition within the sf regime that changes the relative condensate phase of the two polariton components . through our study , we have obtained a clear understanding about this two - component bhm . in the future , we could also realize an two - component bhm that breaks the time reversal symmetry @xcite by manipulating the external fields relative phase .",
