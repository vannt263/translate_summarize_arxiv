    "the s - lemma has suprisingly powerful consequences in robust optimization and control theory , as this result allows to replace certain nonconvex optimization problems by convex polynomial time solvable ones , and semi - infinite programming problems by optimization models with finitely many constraints .",
    "indeed , theorem [ s - lemma ] says that in an optimization problem in which the coefficients @xmath17 of the polynomial @xmath4 play the role of decision variables , the infinitely many constraints @xmath18 can be replaced by a single matrix inequality @xmath19 where @xmath20 are chosen such that @xmath21 , and where @xmath22 is an auxiliary decision variable introduced by this lifting .    for a overviews of the history of the s - lemma and its applications , see @xcite and @xcite .",
