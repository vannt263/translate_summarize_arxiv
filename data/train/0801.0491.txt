    "neutralino , if it is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in r - parity conserving models , is a natural candidate for dark matter . because of the tev scale sparticle interactions",
    ", the thermal history of neutralinos allows the neutralino dark matter possibility .",
    "but , imposing a solution of the strong cp problem , the thermal history involves contributions from the additional sector .",
    "the strong cp problem is naturally solved by introducing a very light axion @xmath0 .",
    "most probably , it appears when the peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry is broken at a scale of @xmath1 . below the pq scale , the effective axion interaction with gluons is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the strong coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "the pq scale is constrained by the astrophysical and cosmological considerations in the narrow window @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "tev scale supersymmetry ( susy ) suggests axino @xmath5 , the superpartner of axion , around the electroweak scale in the gravity mediation scenario . here , we consider the effects of _ heavy _ axinos in cosmology .",
    "the axino cosmology depends crucially on the axino decoupling temperature @xcite , @xmath6 where @xmath7 . the axion supermultiplet includes axion , saxion ( the scalar partner ) and axino .",
    "both saxion and axino masses are split from the almost vanishing axion mass if susy is broken .",
    "the precise value of the axino mass depends on the model , specified by the susy breaking sector and the mediation sector to the axion supermultiplet  @xcite . in principle , the axion supermultiplet is independent from the observable sector in which case we may take the axino mass as a free parameter of order from kev to a value much larger than the gravitino mass @xcite .",
    "light axinos can be a dark matter ( dm ) candidate , which has been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "heavy axinos , however , can not be the lsp and can decay to the lsp plus light particles . this heavy axino decay to neutralino",
    "was considered in the literature @xcite where the neutralino relic density was not considered seriously .",
    "some considered the axino as the next lsp decaying to the gravitino lsp in the gauge mediated susy breaking scenario @xcite .",
    "recently , supersymmetric axion models were studied with an emphasis on saxion @xcite , where the heavy axino possibility was also considered briefly @xcite .    in this paper , we present a more or less complete cosmological analysis of a _ heavy _ axino with mass in the tev region so that it is heavier than the lsp neutralino . compared with the saxion study , the heavy axino study probes susy directly because the axino carries the odd r - charge .",
    "if kinematically allowed , a heavy axino decays predominantly to a gluino and a gluon and the gluino subsequently decays , finally producing the neutralino lsp .",
    "however , if axino is lighter than gluino , this axino to gluino decay is forbidden and the axino predominantly decays to a neutralino and a photon .",
    "the neutralinos from axino decay can annihilate in the cosmos if the neutralino number density , @xmath8 , is large enough so that @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the annihilation cross section . in this case , the neutralino abundance is modified , which is obtained by solving the boltzmann equation . for this to be compatible with the observed dm density ,",
    "we find the required thermally - averaged cross section of neutralino , @xmath11 , to be around @xmath12 . the higgsino - like neutralino can give this kind of large cross section .    the thermally produced @xmath13 gravitinos after inflation induce severe problems on the light element abundances , which restricts the reheating temperature to @xmath14 .",
    "we find that the entropy production from the heavy axino decay can dilute the primordial gravitinos . for axino mass smaller than gluino mass and for a low pq scale , @xmath15",
    ", we find as shown below that there is no gravitino problem for the reheating temperature up to the axino decoupling temperature @xmath16 .",
    "a heavy axino leads to different physical consequences depending on its mass being greater or smaller than the gluino mass @xmath17 .",
    "if axino is heavier than gluino , it decays dominantly to a gluino plus a gluon .",
    "if axino is lighter than gluino , it decays dominantly to a @xmath18-ino - like neutralino and a photon and , if kinematically allowed , to a neutralino and a @xmath19-boson .",
    "thus , the axino decay width is given by ,    \\(i ) @xmath20 @xmath21 ( ii ) @xmath22 : @xmath23 with @xmath24  @xcite , where @xmath25 is the @xmath18-ino fraction of the @xmath26-th neutralino and @xmath27 is a weinberg mixing angle .",
    "hereafter we will use @xmath28 for simplicity .",
    "for the case ( ii ) , as one can see , the lifetime can be easily longer than @xmath29 second .",
    "if the lifetime is shorter than about @xmath29 second , the axino decay does not harm the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "note that for eq .",
    "( [ gamma_axino ] ) the axino lifetime is about @xmath30 .    right after the axino decay ,",
    "the temperature of radiation @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "for the case that axinos dominate the energy density of the universe before they decay , we can regard @xmath34 as the second reheating temperature due to the axino decay .",
    "this temperature is marginal when we discuss its effect on neutralino dm as we discuss below .",
    "this is because , for the axino lifetime of @xmath35 second , this temperature is comparable to the typical neutralino freeze - out temperature @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath37 or equivalently @xmath38 second , the axino decay has no effect on the neutralino dm abundance , because the neutralino produced by the axino decay also could reach the thermal equilibrium . from eq .",
    "( [ gamma_axino ] ) , we can see that this would be the case for a heavier axino or for a lower pq scale .",
    "the axino abundance depends on the thermal history of the early universe after inflation .",
    "another relevant temperature we introduce is the reheating temperature after inflation @xmath39 .",
    "so , the temperatures we introduce are @xmath40    for @xmath41 , axinos were in the thermal equilibrium and the axino number density is comparable to the photon number density .",
    "below the axino decoupling temperature , the axino number in the comoving volume is conserved if there is no new physics below @xmath16 ; then the axino abundance is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the degrees of freedom of axino and @xmath45 is the entropy density .    for @xmath46",
    ", axinos could not be in thermal equilibrium after inflation .",
    "nevertheless , they are regenerated by thermal scattering and by decays of gluinos , squarks and neutralinos in the thermal plasma . for a high enough reheating temperature , @xmath47 ,",
    "the hard thermal loop approximation is good enough and the axino abundance can be approximated as @xcite @xmath48 we can see that the axino abundance might be large in terms of @xmath49 going up to @xmath50 , strongly depending on @xmath39 and @xmath1 .",
    "hence , if many axinos are produced after inflation , axinos might dominate the energy density of the universe before they decay .",
    "let us first examine the condition for axino domination . for @xmath51",
    ", axino becomes nonrelativistic .",
    "when axinos are nonrelativistic , the energy densities of radiation and axinos are given by @xmath52 respectively . from eq .",
    "( [ axino : tma ] ) , we find the axino - radiation equality temperature , @xmath53 , @xmath54 if this equality occurs before axino decays as shown as the inequality , then axino can dominate the universe . on the other hand , for @xmath55 ,",
    "axinos never dominate the energy density of the universe before they decay . in this regard",
    ", we find the lowest reheating temperature , @xmath56 , above which axinos can dominate the universe before they decay , by solving the equality @xmath57    in case axinos dominate the universe , the entropy production by axino decay dilutes the previously existing number densities . the ratio of the entropy per comoving volume before and after the axino decay is @xcite @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "thus , from eqs .",
    "( [ td ] ) and ( [ entropyproduction ] ) , the entropy ratio can be @xmath60 this is shown in figs .  [ fig_fa10 ] and  [ fig_fa12 ] as magenta lines . above the solid line denoted as @xmath61",
    ", axinos can dominate the universe and can produce additional entropy .",
    "similarly , in case that an axino can decay only into a neutralino and a photon [ case ( ii ) ] , @xmath62 looks to be able to become as small as of several mev and @xmath63 might be as large as @xmath64 .",
    "neutralino , which was in the thermal equilibrium in the early universe , decouples and freezes out when the annihilation rate becomes smaller than the hubble parameter .",
    "the freeze - out temperature @xmath65 is normally given by @xmath66 , e.g. @xmath67 for @xmath68 neutralino .",
    "as mentioned above , the neutralino relic density is not affected by axino for @xmath37 .",
    "hence , we consider @xmath69 below and the following arguments are valid only for this case .",
    "another crucial issue in this case is whether the produced neutralinos from the axino decay would annihilate again or not . if the neutralino number density from axino decay is too large , i.e. for @xmath70 the produced neutralinos would annihilate more .      for @xmath69 ,",
    "let us consider the cases of axino domination .",
    "first , let us consider the case that axinos would dominate the universe but the produced neutralino can not annihilate . from eqs .",
    "( [ dominationcondition ] ) and ( [ annihilationcondition ] ) , this occurs if @xmath71 is satisfied .",
    "the equality in ( [ dominationnoannihilation ] ) is estimated using eq .",
    "( [ entropyratio ] ) assuming that the neutralino abundance from axino decay is much bigger than that from thermal freeze - out .",
    "this condition is not likely to be satisfied for the range of our @xmath72 and @xmath34 .",
    "this leads us to the case that eq .",
    "( [ dominationnoannihilation ] ) is not satisfied , i.e. neutralinos produced ( from axino decay and thermal freeze - out ) annihilate .",
    "the final abundance is obtained solving the boltzmann equation , @xmath73 where @xmath10 is the annihilation cross section of two neutralinos , @xmath74 is their relative velocity and @xmath75 is the thermal average . with @xmath76 ,",
    "the evolution equation is @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the entropy density , and @xmath79 in the radiation dominated era .    applying the sudden decay approximation , after the decay of axinos",
    ", the radiation and neutralino densities can be easily estimated .",
    "the radiation dominates the universe soon and the neutralinos start to annihilate .",
    "we can solve this evolution equation from the time after axino decay , @xmath34 , to later times . the final abundance @xmath80 at temperature @xmath81 after neutralino annihilation can be expressed as @xmath82 here , @xmath83 is the sum of neutralino densities from thermal freeze - out and from the axino decay , right after axino decay but before neutralino annihilation , @xmath84 when axino dominates before the neutralino freeze - out , @xmath85 , then the freezed - out neutralino relic density , which is different from the standard one in the radiation dominated universe , can be obtained as @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 is the freeze - out temperature of the neutralino in the nonrelativistic axino matter dominated universe .",
    "otherwise , i.e. for @xmath90 we obtain @xmath91     vs. @xmath72 plot for @xmath92 .",
    "the region @xmath41 is above the dashed blue line ( horizontal ) .",
    "the axino lifetime greater than @xmath29 sec is denoted by the red shaded region in the left side .",
    "the blue shaded region in the right side is where axino decays before neutralino decouples ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the magenta lines ( horizontal ) are the contours of the entropy increase , @xmath93 . above @xmath61 lines",
    "axinos dominate the universe before they decay .",
    "the green lines ( vertical ) denote the @xmath94 in units of @xmath95 which are used to give the right amount of neutralino relic density by eq .",

    "when the number density of neutralinos from the axino s sudden decay is much larger , so that @xmath100 , then we obtain the result of  @xcite . in this limit",
    ", the relic density can be approximated and simplified as @xmath101 where we normalized @xmath34 for an axino decay to gluino and gluon .",
    "the relic density of neutralino is proportional to the neutralino mass which is different from the standard one where @xmath102 .      in the case that axinos",
    "never dominate the universe , @xmath103 , the resultant neutralino lsp abundance is given by eqs .",

    "( [ frzout : neutralino ] ) and ( [ ntp : axino ] ) .    if eq .",
    "( [ annihilationcondition ] ) is satisfied , as in the previous case , we obtain the same final neutralino relic abundance as that given in eq .",
    "( [ neutralinorelicdensity ] ) .",
    "this is evident if we think that the final neutralino relic density after re - annihilation is determined from the hubble parameter at the time of axino decay .    on the other hand ,",
    "( [ annihilationcondition ] ) is not satisfied , we simply obtain @xmath106 this is possible when the axino abundance is too small , which is the case for low reheating temperature @xmath107 . for a large annihilation cross section ,",
    "the first term becomes negligible and the second term is dominant . in this case , the neutralino number density is given by thermally produced axino s .",

    "in the early universe , gravitinos are produced after reheating .",
    "it is known that the gravitino abundance is proportional to the reheating temperature @xmath39 .",
    "if the gravitino is not the lsp then it can decay . since the interaction of gravitino",
    "is suppressed by the planck mass , the lifetime is much longer than that of axino , usually falling in the bbn or post - bbn era .",
    "the decay products of gravitino can change the abundances of light elements and gives the severe constraint on the reheating temperature , @xmath114 for @xmath115 @xcite .    for a high reheating temperature in our scenario ,",
    "the axino dominates the universe and excessive entropy is produced as shown in eq .",
    "( [ entropyratio ] ) , which may soften the gravitino problem .",
    "this entropy production is proportional to the reheating temperature , which is of the same form as the gravitino production .",
    "therefore , as @xmath39 increases , the increased number of gravitinos is diluted by the increased entropy from the axino decay , which renders the gravitino abundance independent of the reheating temperature after axino enters into the axino dominated phase in the universe .",
    "this independence is true only when @xmath39 is smaller than the axino decoupling temperature @xmath16 .",

    "<S> we consider cosmological consequences of a heavy axino , decaying to the neutralino in r - parity conserving models . </S>",
    "<S> the importance and influence of the axino decay on the resultant abundance of neutralino dark matter depends on the lifetime and the energy density of axino . for a high reheating temperature after inflation , </S>",
    "<S> copiously produced axinos dominate the energy density of the universe and its decay produces a large amount of entropy . as a bonus </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain that the upper bound on the reheating temperature after inflation via gravitino decay can be moderated , because the entropy production by the axino decay more or less dilutes the gravitinos . </S>"
