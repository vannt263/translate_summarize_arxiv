    "in recent years , a lot of interest has been concentrated on improving the description of neutrino interactions  @xcite .",
    "the motivations behind this research are future precise neutrino experiments which require better knowledge about the cross sections .",
    "it also makes crucial whether the theoretical models can be implemented in monte carlo ( mc ) event generators .",
    "many papers focus on neutrino energies of a  few gev because this is the proposed energy range of several long - baseline experiments . in this energy region one",
    "has to consider both quasielastic and inelastic charge current ( cc ) processes .",
    "it is common to factorize neutrino - nucleus interaction into two steps : an interaction with a _",
    "bound nucleon ( impulse approximation ) and then reinteractions inside nucleus .",
    "the main difficulty is caused by the need of precise evaluation of the nuclear effects .",
    "existing mc codes rely on various versions of the fermi gas ( fg ) model because it is straightforward to implement them in the mc routine . the simplest fg model with two adjustable parameters  fermi momentum and average binding energy  can be modified by inclusion of the recoil nucleus energy in the kinematics   and by local density effects @xcite .",
    "it is , however , clear from the experience gained in describing the electron - nucleus interactions that the model can be considered only as the first approximation and that the mc simulations based on the fg model can be neither detailed nor precise .",
    "the approach which introduces more realistic picture of a  nucleus is the one using the spectral function ( sf )  .",
    "the sf describes a  distribution of momenta and removal energies of nucleons inside nucleus . in theoretical models",
    ", the sf combines contributions from the shell model ( the mean field part ) and from the short - range correlations . the second one ( about 20% of the overall strength )",
    "accounts for the higher momentum and removal energy values  .",
    "recently , this part has been directly observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "computations based on the sf reproduce precisely the electron scattering data in the region of the quasielastic peak  .    in this paper we adopt the plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) and neglect the effects of final state interactions ( fsi ) except those from pauli blocking .",
    "evaluation of fsi is necessary in order to compare the predictions of the model with experimental data .",
    "it is argued in refs .",
    "that in computation of the inclusive cross section ( after summing over the final hadronic states ) the construction of the sf and the treatment of fsi are two independent problems .",
    "calculation of fsi effects is usually based on the complex optical potential . in the case of electron scattering ,",
    "fsi do not change much the overall cross section at the fixed angle : the elastic peak is quenched and the cross section is redistributed making the peak wider . for the gev neutrino interactions , i.e. when most of the quasielastic cross section corresponds to small values of @xmath0 , it is useful to distinguish pauli blocking from the remaining fsi effects , because impact of the latter on the cross section is quite small ( compare , for example fig .  14 in  ) .",
    "there is a lot of discussion in the literature on the fsi effects in other approaches to quasielastic neutrino - nucleus scattering . in some of the recent papers  ( e.g. , ref .  ) , fsi is implied to be responsible only for a redistribution of the inclusive cross section among various exclusive observable channels .",
    "a similar meaning of fsi is adopted in many mc generators of events @xcite .",
    "however in other theoretical approaches , the fsi effects modify also the inclusive cross section . in  @xcite , it is achieved by using the dressed nucleon propagator with the contribution from the self - energy .",
    "references  @xcite and  @xcite describe the final nucleon wave function as a solution of the dirac equation with the relativistic optical potential , the inclusive cross section is then obtained if the imaginary part of the potential is neglected . for @xmath1",
    "gev neutrinos the fsi effects are reported to reduce the inclusive cross section by @xmath2 .",
    "we confine our consideration to quasielastic reactions ( the primary vertex ) , but we would like to stress that its extension to the resonance region is straightforward .",
    "several papers consider the two dynamics together  , also in the formalism of the spectral function  .",
    "( recent discussion of the resonance region can be found in  .",
    ") however , we focus on the construction of the spectral function , and the inclusion of the resonance region is not likely to provide an extra input . in the discussion of the resonance region",
    "some new theoretical uncertainties appear : the properties of resonances in the nuclear matter and the nonresonant background  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the theoretical understanding of the basic dynamics is still not complete since in the case of electron scattering it is difficult to reproduce the cross section in the dip region between the elastic and @xmath3 resonance peaks @xcite .    for a  few - gev neutrino one",
    "has to consider also more inelastic channels .",
    "they are described by means of the dis formalism with the specific techniques to include the nuclear effects .",
    "a recent comprehensive study discussed the following nuclear effects : fermi motion and nuclear binding ( fmb ) , off - shell corrections ( os ) , nuclear pion excess and coherent processes  .",
    "the results of the analysis show that in the kinematical region of large bjorken @xmath4 variable only fmb and os effects are relevant .",
    "both fmb and os corrections are present in our approach : fmb is the core of the spectral function computations and os were included in the de forest prescription of evaluating weak current hadronic matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "there has been a lot of effort to calculate the spectral functions  .",
    "systematic computations exist only for light nuclei up to oxygen and also for infinite nuclear matter .",
    "the aim of this paper is to calculate the spectral function for argon and to discuss its application to computation of the neutrino - argon cross section .",
    "liquid - argon technology has been successively tested in the case of the icarus t600 module  @xcite and is now considered as an option in many neutrino experiments @xcite .",
    "one of the experiments is the t2k where liquid - ar detector is planned to be an element of the 2  km detector complex  @xcite .    in our computations , we follow the approach proposed by kulagin and petti   which is partially based on the paper of ciofi degli atti and simula  .",
    "the computations contain several approximations , and it is necessary to understand how precise the results are . for this reason we first analyze the approximation in the case of oxygen , the heaviest nucleus for which detailed computations of the spectral function exist .",
    "our conclusion is that the agreement is satisfactory , and we pursue the computations for the argon .",

    "the information is encoded in two functions .",
    "the first one is the distribution of the nucleon momenta , and the second is the average binding energy for a given value of momentum .",
    "these two functions can be inserted in the smith - moniz formula for the inclusive cross section which can be easily implemented in a  mc routine .",

    "summation over all the final states and averaging over the spin states of the initial nucleus is performed .",
    "we omitted spin and isospin dependencies of the annihilation operator , but one has to keep in mind that there are two separate spectral functions : one for protons and another for neutrons .",
    "the spectral function contains a lot of information about the nucleus .",
    "it follows from its definition that @xmath27 is the distribution of momenta inside the nucleus .",
    "we normalize the nucleon distribution of momenta @xmath28 ( and then also the spectral function ) as @xmath29 in pwia it is straightforward to obtain the following expression for the inclusive cross section : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32-\\frac{(p+p')^\\mu f_2(q^2)}{2m}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\gamma^\\mu\\gamma_{5}f_a(q^2)+\\gamma_{5}\\frac{q^\\mu f_p(q^2)}m.\\ ] ] the hadronic tensor @xmath33 has to be further specified because nucleons described by   are off shell .",
