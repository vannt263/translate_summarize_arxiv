    "black hole accretion is one of the most powerful energy sources in the universe .",
    "when the luminosity of the system is close to the eddington luminosity , the accretion can be described by the classical shakura - sunyaev disk ( 1973 ) , which produces a multi - color blackbody radiation with the flux and temperature determined by the black hole mass and accretion rate .",
    "observations of galactic black hole x - ray binaries strongly support such a scenario ( gierliski & done 2004 ) .",
    "the less energetic non - thermal high energy emission component frequently observed has been attributed to hot magnetized coronas above the disk ( gierliski et al .",
    "1999 ; zhang et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) has been generally accepted as the basic mechanism producing the less well - understood turbulence viscosity that drives the accretion ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) .",
    "the dissipated gravitational energy is first converted into mhd turbulence , which then heats the accretion flow through viscous and ohmic dissipations . in these optically thick slim disks ,",
    "the coulomb collision time scales are much shorter than other relevant time scales , electrons and ions reach a thermal equilibrium so that the observed emission can be well - described with blackbody spectra modified by the radiation transfer through the disk structure .",
    "the acceleration and/or heating of electrons by turbulence can at most be studied with observations of the non - thermal component emitted from the collision - less coronas ( dermer et al .",
    "1996 ; li & miller 1997 ) .",
    "many black hole candidates are often observed in a super- or sub- eddington emission state , and there are many distinct observational phenomena , such as relativistic outflows and quasi - periodic oscillations , that have not been well understood though many models have been proposed ( fender et al . 2004 ; remillard et al .",
    "1999 ; falcke et al .",
    "2004 ; camenzind 2005 ) .",
    "both theoretical investigations and observations suggest that , below a critical mass accretion rate @xmath0 , a two - temperature accretion flow likely develop near the black hole due to the much higher radiation efficiency of electrons than ions and inefficient coulomb coupling between them so that the local thermal equilibrium can not be established between the two ( shapiro et al . 1976 ; rees et al .",
    "1982 ; zdziarski et al . 2002 ; titarchuk & fiorito 2004 ) .",
    "such a two - temperature flow is also expected due to the fact that charged particles reach a thermal equilibrium with their kind much faster than with others through coulomb collisions ( spitzer 1962 )",
    ". this paper studies the electron heating processes in these low states .    besides energy exchanges through coulomb collisions , charged particles",
    "can also be energized by plasma waves through collision - less processes .",
    "these energization processes will directly affect the characteristics of the observed emission and therefore play crucial roles in our study of these systems in the low states . as pointed out by bisnovatyi - kogan and lovelace ( 1997 )",
    ", the ohmic heating of electrons through dissipation of mhd turbulence can be very efficient .",
    "sharma et al . ( 2007 ) recently found that electrons might also be energized in the dynamo processes of magnetic field amplification through the mri .",
    "however , the complexity of processes in a turbulent plasma has made the collision - less electron heating by collective plasma effects a difficult problem ( rees et al .",
    "1982 ) . in these theoretical investigations ,",
    "certain assumptions have to be made on the coupling between charged particles and the turbulent electromagnetic fields to derive some quantitative results , which are usually sensitive to the prior assumptions .    the collision - less electron heating by turbulent magnetic fields is often ignored in most phenomenological models ( shapiro et al . 1976 ) . in the advection dominated accretion flow models , it is simply assumed that a small fraction of the energy dissipated through viscosity is converted into electrons ( esin et al .",
    "1998 ; yuan et al .",
    "2006 ) , suggesting that this is a trivial process . alternatively",
    ", one - temperature models have been proposed for sagittarius a * , the compact radio source associated with the low - luminosity supermassive black hole in the galactic center ( schdel et al .",
    "2002 ; ghez et al .",
    "2005 ) , assuming that electrons and protons are coupled by turbulence effectively ( melia et al . 2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the collision - less electron heating processes may be constrained by observations of the relevant systems .",
    "recent studies of flares from sagittarius a * indicate that electrons can be heated efficiently by mhd turbulence and the distribution of relativistic electrons under the influence of a turbulent magnetic field can be approximated as relativistic maxwellian ( baganoff et al .",

    "the same processes may also play important roles in the heating of electrons in the two - temperature accretion flows . in this paper",
    ", we consider a keplerian accretion disk model and the dominant cooling processes in a fully ionized magnetized plasma .",
    "we show that coulomb collisions with ions can not heat electrons efficiently and an extra electron heating process is required to explain observations of sagittarius a * and the galactic x - ray binary cygnus x-1 ( wilms et al .",
    "this is in contradiction with what is suggested in some of the previous studies .",
    "magnetic turbulence could play such a role , and we believe that the collision - less heating of electrons by mhd turbulence should not be ignored in any quantitative studies of these low accretion states .    the critical mass accretion rate is determined by the cooling processes and collisional energy exchanges between electrons and ions .",
    "although the collision - less turbulence heating can reduce @xmath0 by increasing the radiation efficiency and cooling rate , we find that this effect is insignificant .",

    "due to the decoupling between electrons and ions , the radiation efficiencies of two - temperature accretion flows will not be as high as the optically thick slim disks .",
    "the accretion processes likely drive strong winds from the hot disk ( blandford and begelman 1999 ) , and there are currently no strong observational constraints on these processes . to simplify our model",
    "we consider the steady state properties of the accretion flow averaged in the vertical direction and assume a radius independent accretion rate , i.e. , ignoring the effects of winds : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the radial velocity and the scale height of the accretion flow , respectively , and @xmath24 is the proton mass .",
    "the vertical structure of the disk can be very complicated as suggested by mhd simulations ( hawley & balbus 2002 ) and may be essential to explain the observed non - thermal high energy emission in low states ( dermer et al . 1996 ; li & miller 1997 ) . it ,",

    "because the viscous stress driving the accretion is induced by the mri ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) , the gravitational energy dissipation first generates mhd turbulence , which then heats the gas as the turbulence cascades from large scales to small scales .",
    "a fraction of the turbulence energy may also be carried away from the disk by mhd waves propagating toward large radii . however",
    ", this process is not expected to dominate the dynamics of the accretion flow at least for the relative more powerful states , when the hard x - ray luminosity of x - ray binaries can be a significant fraction of the eddington luminosity .",
    "very high accretion rates will be needed to produce the observed x - ray power if waves carry most of the dissipated gravitational energy toward large radii .",
    "the turbulence cascade also needs to be suppressed dramatically to make the wave escape process dominant .",
    "therefore , in the steady state , the viscous heating rate @xmath40\\over{\\rm d } r}\\ ] ] should be slightly greater than the turbulence cascade rate @xmath41 where @xmath42 is dimensionless and determined by the properties of the turbulence and @xmath43^{1/2}\\ ] ] is the speed of fast mode waves ( liu et al .",
    "there is therefore an intimate connection between the viscous stress and turbulence dissipation .",

    "the disk structure can be obtained once one specifies the electron heating and cooling rates and the electron and proton temperatures at the outer boundary .",

    "we see that two - temperature flows can readily develop at small radii even without considering the electron cooling processes .",
    "when coulomb collisions become less efficient at smaller radii , in principle the distributions of electrons and protons are not necessarily maxwellian . however , at a given mean energy , the time scales for protons and electrons reaching equilibrium with themselves are , respectively , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which are much shorter than @xmath63 , the time scale for electrons and protons reaching thermal equilibrium with each other ( spitzer 1962 ) . the electron and proton distributions therefore may start to deviate from maxwellian at @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "so the transition radius , where the proton distribution may deviate from maxwellian , is more than ten times smaller than the radius , where the two - temperature flow starts to develop .",
    "the transition radius for electrons is even smaller , and a maxwellian distribution can be achieved at small radii through relativistic effects and cooling processes ( wolfe & melia 2006 ; bittner et al .",
    "we therefore expect that the electron distribution be always dominated by a thermal component and , over a significant radius range , a two - temperature flow develop self - consistently",
    ". the fact that the low - hard state spectra of x - ray binaries can be fitted with the thermal inverse comptonization model also suggests a dominant thermal electron component .    at very low accretion rates",
    ", the coulomb collision time scales can be much longer than other relevant time scales near the black hole , and we do not expect maxwellian distributions for both electrons and ions .",
    "this is a completely new regime , where the behavior of the turbulent plasma has not been well studied . in these cases ,",
    "the `` temperature '' of the particles should be interpreted as a measurement of their mean energies .",
    "the actual electron distribution may be constrained by studying its radiation spectrum .",
    "we note that the proton distribution is always expected to deviate from maxwellian at very small radii , where the energy dissipation rate is high , and a high energy proton population may be responsible for the formation of jets in the low states ( dermer et al .",
    "1996 ; liu et al .",
    "a detailed investigation of these effects is beyond the scope of this paper .    from @xmath73 and the above solution",
    ", we have @xmath74 .",
    "the viscous stress therefore needs to be comparable to the turbulent magnetic field energy density . since the viscous stress should not be much greater than the turbulent magnetic field energy density ( pessah et al .",
    "2006 ) , the fact that @xmath42 requires that @xmath75 can not be much less than @xmath76 .",
    "so the energy carried away by winds and/or waves should account for a small fraction of the dissipated gravitational energy except that the turbulence cascade from large scales to small scales is suppressed for some reason so that @xmath77 becomes much less than @xmath78 .",
    "we also note that for this solution , @xmath79 .",
    "the turbulence electron heating effectively converts a constant fraction @xmath80 of the viscously dissipated gravitational energy into the internal energy of electrons . the electron heating rate by turbulence is given by @xmath81",

    "although this result is similar to that proposed in the advection dominated accretion flow models ( esin et al .",
    "1998 ) , the electron heating studied here becomes very efficient when cooling reduces the electron temperature or the electrons become relativistic since the heating time is proportional to the mean velocity of electrons .",
    "accordingly , coulomb collisional heating may suppress the turbulence heating by increasing @xmath84 .",
    "since the heating is more efficient when electrons become relativistic , an even stricter constraint on @xmath45 can be obtained by considering the accretion processes at small radii . for @xmath85 and @xmath86 , @xmath87 , the accretion time is given by @xmath88 to avoid electrons being overheated , the electron heating time needs to be longer than the accretion time , then we have : @xmath89 where we have used the fact that , for the accretion flow we are considering , @xmath90 .    for @xmath54 , we solve equations ( [ eqtp ] ) and ( [ eqte ] ) numerically to constrain the heating rate more quantitatively .",

    "this statement is not necessarily true if the formation of hot accretion flows is triggered by some instability near black holes .",
    "however , for @xmath188 , the electron temperature is more than 1 mev near the black hole , which is much higher than the observed values in the low - hard states ( see fig .",

    "it is clear that , besides the local internal cooling processes considered above , other cooling processes have to be introduced to bring the electron temperature to the desired energy range . observations of x - ray binaries in the low - hard states show that photons from the large - scale optically thick slim disk can provide sufficient soft photons to cool electrons in the inner two - temperature flow through ic ( barrio et al .",
    ". the cooling rate will also increase if we consider a global radiation transfer and include the cooling due to pair production . here",
    "we treat these cooling processes approximately by assuming the energy density of the soft photons produced outside the two - temperature accretion flow is three times higher than the local magnetic field energy density so that there is an extra cooling term 3 times higher than that given by equation ( [ lsyn1 ] ) .",

    "however , with @xmath101 , which is proportional to the thomson optical depth of the accretion flow , varying by two orders of magnitude , the electron temperature in the inner region remains about @xmath192 kev .",

    ", we obtain temperature profiles in panel `` c '' .",
    "because ic cooling is already important at the outer boundary , @xmath194 decreases slightly due to more efficient electron heating , which results in more cooling of the accretion flow .",

    "to explain the millimeter and sub - millimeter spectrum and polarization of sagittarius a * and the recently observed anti - correlation between the electron temperature and the thomson optical depth of cygnus x-1 in the low - hard and intermediate states , we show that electrons need to be heated efficiently by turbulence plasma waves .",
    "coulomb collisions are not effective enough to heat electrons to the temperature required by observations of sagittarius a * that has a very low accretion rate .",
    "the critical mass accretion rate , below which a two - temperature solution may exist , is determined by the radiative cooling and coulomb collisional heating processes and is almost independent of the electron heating by turbulence . to reproduce the observed high luminosity of x - ray binaries in the low accretion states , a high viscosity is required to increase the critical mass accretion rate , and the radial velocity of the accretion flow can be comparable to the keplerian velocity .",
    "we show that the electron cooling for galactic x - ray binaries needs to be dominated by ic of an external soft photon field originated presumably from a large - scale cold slim disk .",
    "synchrotron , synchrotron self - comptonization , and bremsstrahlung processes inside the hot accretion flows are not efficient enough to cool the electrons to the observed temperature range . assuming that the energy density of these external photons is 3 times higher than the local magnetic field energy density , we find that the electron temperature at the critical accretion rate is determined by this energy density ratio .",
    "a lower external photon energy density gives rise to a higher electron temperature .",
    "this high external photo energy density suggests that the radiation field may have important dynamical effects and may be partially responsible for the required high viscosity .",
    "recent observations of cygnus x-1 show that the electron temperature in the ic model ( titarchuk 1994 ) decreases by more than a factor of 10 when the thomson optical depth , which is proportional to the accretion rate , increases by two orders of magnitude in the low - hard and intermediate states . we show that very efficient electron heating by turbulence can reproduce such an anti - correlation . without this extra heating process",
    "( besides the coulomb collisional heating ) , the electron temperature is almost independent of the accretion rate .",
    "it appears that such an anti - correlation may also be explained by adjusting the properties of the external photo field ( esin et al .",
    "it is , however , not clear whether the observed dramatic changes in both the electron temperature and the thomson optical depth can be reproduced in such a scenario .",
    "detailed modeling of the external photo field is required to address this issue and to fit the broadband spectrum of cygnus x-1 in the low - hard and intermediate states .",
    "we have shown that a two - temperature flow can develop self - consistently at small radii for low accretion rates mostly due to the fact that electrons and protons reach a thermal equilibrium with themselves much faster than with each other through coulomb collisions . however , at very low accretion rates , there is no guarantee that the proton distribution is maxwellian although electrons may reach a quasi - thermal distribution due to balancing between the cooling and heating processes .",
    "observations of the low - hard states of x - ray binaries also suggest that the electron distribution is dominated by a thermal component .",
    "when coulomb collision time scales are much longer than other relevant time scales , the particle `` temperature '' should be interpreted as a measurement of the internal energy but not a thermal distribution .    with the pseudo - newtonian potential and assumption of keplerian azimuthal velocities , processes below @xmath203",
    "can not be described accurately by our model .",
    "these processes can have important observational consequences ( titarchuk & fiorito 2004 ) and may drive strong outflows responsible for the observed radio emission ( heinz & sunyaev 2003 ; fender et al .",
    "2004 ; falcke et al .",
    "2004 ) . by dropping these assumptions and considering the momentum conservation in the radial direction",
    ", one may build a more complete model to study these processes ( popham & gammie 1998 ) .    in the model",
    "we have ignored the vertical structure of the disk , dynamical effects of the radiation field , winds and/or outflows , outwardly directed waves , and pair productions , which can be important for x - ray binaries .",
    "these may introduce a factor of a few changes in our model parameters , especially in regards to the temperature profile of protons and the transition from an one - temperature flow at large radii to the two - temperature inner region , which may have important implications on the origin of quasi - periodic oscillations .",
    "but our conclusion of the presence of efficient collision - less electron heating by turbulence is not affected .",
    "electrons can also be accelerated by mhd turbulence to very high energies in coronas of the disk and produce the observed non - thermal high energy spectral component ( gierliski et al .",
    "these electrons carry much less energy than the thermal electron population considered in this paper and can be treated with appropriate corona models ( dermer et al .",
    "1996 ; li & miller 1997 ) .",
    "our treatment of the electron heating by turbulence is different from that proposed in the advection dominated accretion flow models ( yuan et al .",
    "2006 ) , where the energy equation is separated into two equations , one for electrons and the other for ions , and it is assumed that a fixed fraction of the viscously dissipated energy is deposited into electrons .",
    "we point out that equation ( [ energy ] ) is the more appropriate energy equation one should adopt and there is no reasonable justification to split it into two equations except that the coupling between electrons and ions through plasma waves or turbulence can be ignored .",
    "our results and the mri clearly show the opposite , i.e. turbulence plays crucial roles in an accretion flow .",
    "it is also difficult to understand why a fixed fraction of the viscously dissipated energy goes into electrons .",
    "electron heating by plasma waves should depend on the properties of the plasma and turbulence ( bisnovatyi - kogan & lovelace 1997 ; quataert 1998 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eqte ] ) is perhaps more appropriate to describe the temperature evolution of electrons .",
    "it is very challenging to study turbulence , one of the commonest natural phenomena .",
    "it originates from the non - linear nature of complex many body systems . in astrophysics , mhd turbulence is ubiquitous , and one of the most important effects of it is the energization of charged particles in collision - less plasmas .",
    "the microscopic details of this stochastic particle acceleration process are still a matter of debate .",
    "even the common practice of treating mhd turbulence as a spectrum of plasma waves is not well justified , especially for strong turbulence .",
    "the results in this paper provide a means to study the energization of electrons and ions by turbulence , specifically the energy partition between the two particles , with observations .",
    "our results suggest that the electron heating time by turbulence is at least 10 times shorter than that of protons at a given mean particle speed .",
    "detailed modeling of the radiation spectrum and mhd simulations of the accretion flows will lead to more quantitative results .",
    "we note that the dimensionless parameter @xmath45 , which characterizes the electron heating by turbulence in our model , decreases by a factor of @xmath204 from the supermassive black hole of sagittarius a * to the stellar mass black hole in cygnus x-1 .",
    "this may be related to the dramatic increase of the turbulence viscosity described by @xmath30 , which changes from 0.1 for sagittarius a * to 3 for galactic x - ray binaries .",
    "indeed , the product of the two changes by less than a factor of 2 .",
    "because @xmath74 is proportional to the energy dissipation rate of mhd turbulence , the energy partition between electrons and ions is described by @xmath205 .",
    "our results suggest that in the two - temperature accretion states of black holes , this partition weakly depends on the black hole mass and mass accretion rate .",

    "<S> we show that , in a few well - observed black hole accretion systems , there is compelling observational evidence of efficient electron heating by turbulence or collective plasma effects in low accretion states , when coulomb collisions are not efficient enough to establish a thermal equilibrium between electrons and ions at small radii . </S>",
    "<S> however , charged particles reach a thermal equilibrium with their kind much faster than with others through coulomb collisions , a two - temperature accretion flow is expected . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a keplerian accretion flow with a constant mass accretion rate in the pseudo - newtonian gravitational potential and take into account the bremsstrahlung , synchrotron , and inverse comptonization cooling processes . </S>",
    "<S> the critical mass accretion rate , below which the two - temperature solution may exist , is determined by the cooling processes and the collisional energy exchanges between electrons and ions and has very weak dependence on the collision - less heating of electrons by turbulence , which becomes more important at lower accretion rates . </S>",
    "<S> collision - less heating of electrons by mhd turbulence can no longer be ignored in quantitative investigations of these systems . </S>"
