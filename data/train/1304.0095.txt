    "recent transient surveys ( e.g. , the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system , the palomar transient factory , the catalina real - time transient survey [ crts ] , the texas supernova search now operating as the rotse supernova verification project ) and growing support from amateur observers have uncovered ever - increasing diversity in the observational properties of supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "indeed , the standard classification system type i and type ii originally proposed by @xcite has branched considerably from its binary roots , and is continually being updated in the face of new objects that bridge subtypes and extend luminosity ranges .",
    "some of the more luminous h- and he - poor sne discovered by these efforts have garnered especial attention because of their connection with long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "strong evidence for this relationship came from multi - wavelength observations of sn1998bw , a broad - lined sn ic coincident with grb980425 , and belonging to an energetic class of explosions reaching @xmath2  erg called hypernovae @xcite . the handful of energetic broad - lined sn ic that have been well - observed vary considerably in their properties and are not always accompanied with grbs , e.g. , sn1997ef @xcite .",
    "superluminous sne ( slsne ) with absolute magnitudes of @xmath8 are recent members of the growing sn classification zoo @xcite .",
    "h - poor examples can be even more powerful than sne ic @xcite , and there has been considerable effort to understand their nature and relationship with more typical sne .",
    "one of the first examples of the h - poor variety was sn2007bi @xcite , which was originally suggested to be the result of the pair - instability explosion mechanism @xcite .",
    "alternative interpretations , however , have been offered @xcite , including those involving a central engine magnetar @xcite , interaction with circumstellar shells @xcite , or fe core collapse @xcite . to date , no slsn has been observationally connected to a grb .",
    "here we report photometric and spectroscopic data on sn2012au , an object that suggests a link between some subtypes of energetic and h - poor sne and slsne .",
    "although initial spectroscopic observations showed prominent helium absorption features of an otherwise ordinary sn  ib @xcite , continued monitoring of sn2012au through to nebular stages ( @xmath9 d ) revealed extraordinary emission properties in its optical and near - infrared spectra that prompted this _ letter_. a complementary analysis of sn2012au s radio and x - ray emissions is forthcoming in kamble et al .",

    "sn2012au was discovered on 2012 march 14 ut by the crts snhunt project @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : lcurves ] ( left ) shows the region around the sn and its host galaxy ngc4790 ( @xmath10 mpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "sn2012au is located at coordinates @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( j2000.0 ) , which is is less than 600 pc away in projection from the center of ngc4790 s bright central nucleus .    ultra - violet ( uv ) and optical observations with the _ swift_-uvot instrument began 2012 march 15 and continued through to 2012 april 21 ( pi p.  brown ) .",
    "data were acquired using six broad band filters and have been analyzed following standard procedures .",
    "the details of these _",
    "swift_-uvot observations are provided in table  [ tab : photometry ] .",
    "two epochs of late - time @xmath13-band photometry of sn2012au were obtained .",
    "a sequence of @xmath14s dithered images were taken on 2013 january 23 using the 2.4 m hiltner telescope at mdm observatory with the osmos instrumentmartini / osmos/ ] and mdm4k detector , and a sequence of @xmath15s dithered images were taken on 2013 feb 18 using the 6.5 m mmt with the mmtcam instrument .",
    "images were bias - subtracted , flat - fielded , and stacked following standard procedures using the iraf software .",
    "emission from sn2012au dropped @xmath16  mag between maximum light and our first late - time measurement 308 days later .",
    "this decline is considerably slower than other sne ib / c ; e.g. , sn1998bw declined by @xmath17  mag over the same time period @xcite .",
    "the longevity of the brightness made it impossible to obtain subtraction templates that could completely remove contaminating emission from the underlying host galaxy .",
    "photometric measurements were thus made using the ` sextractor ` software @xcite and checked manually using point - spread - function fitting techniques .",
    "we constructed a pseudo - bolometric light curve using the _ swift_-uvot photometry .",
    "observations were corrected assuming @xmath18 and a total reddening of @xmath19 mag .",
    "this estimate combines reddening due to the milky way , @xmath20 mag @xcite , and host internal extinction of @xmath21 mag determined from measuring the equivalent width ( ew ) of d absorption in our optical spectra ( section [ sec : spectra ] ) and using the relationship between ew and @xmath22 described in @xcite .",
    "+     the pseudo - bolometric light curve incorporates two values from @xcite , one of which is a detection of the sn on 2012 march 4 that constrains the rise time from explosion to peak brightness to be @xmath23 16 days .",
    "we summed the flux emitted in the @xmath24 through @xmath25 bands by means of a trapezoidal interpolation and estimated the missing flux from the @xmath26 pass - bands and the near - infrared around the time of maximum light , @xmath27 . using values observed in other sne ib / c ( see @xcite ) , we assumed that for @xmath28d , the @xmath29band flux contribution varies from 25% to 40% and the near - infrared band contribution varies from 15% to 45% .",
    "the pseudo - bolometric light curve was modeled using assumptions in @xcite and following procedures in @xcite to determine the sn s total nickel mass , @xmath30 , explosion kinetic energy , @xmath31 , and total ejecta mass @xmath32 .",
    "a constant optical opacity k@xmath33 of @xmath34 @xmath35 g@xmath36 was adopted ( see @xcite for details ) . our best - fit model shown in figure  [ fig : lcurves ] ( right )",
    "uses the explosion date 2012 march 3.5 , and a rise time of @xmath37  d. the peak bolometric luminosity is @xmath38 ergs@xmath36 , and the estimates of the explosion parameters are @xmath4 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 erg .",
    "we break the degeneracy between @xmath31 and @xmath32 using an estimate of the ejecta velocity measured from our optical spectra around @xmath27 to be @xmath41 km s@xmath36 ( section  [ sec : spectra ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath30 is consistent with independent estimates derived from the late - time photometry under the assumption of full gamma - ray trapping ( figure  [ fig : lcurves ] , right , inset ) .",
    "these explosion parameters are comparable to those estimated for the hypernovae sn1998bw ( @xmath42 and @xmath43erg ; @xcite ) and sn1997ef ( @xmath44 and @xmath45erg ; @xcite ) .",
    "we note that sn2012au may exhibit properties that are not strictly incorporated in the @xcite model we have used .",
    "opacities as high as @xmath46 @xmath35 g@xmath36 could apply that increase the @xmath47/@xmath32 ratio to values that run contrary to model assumptions , and optical spectra ( section  [ sec : late - time ] ) suggest possible deviations from the model s spherically symmetric conditions .",
    "future work may look to apply more sophisticated models to address these additional factors .",
    "low - resolution optical spectra of sn2012au were obtained from march 2012 through feb 2013 .",
    "many of these observations were made with the f.   l.  whipple observatory 1.5-m telescope mounted with the fast instrument @xcite .",
    "additional observations were obtained with the mmt 6.5 m telescope using the blue channel instrument @xcite , and the 2.4 m mdm telescope using the osmos instrument .",
    "standard procedures using the iraf software were followed and flux calibrations were made using our own idl routines .",

    "emissions from sne ib / c at these epochs are normally optically thin and dominated by [ ] 6300 , 6364 , [ ] 7291 , 7324 , and ] @xmath564571 .",
    "in addition to these emissions , however , sn2012au shows persistent p - cyg absorptions attributable in part to at @xmath6  , as well as unusually strong emissions from h&k , d , and a feature around 7775  we identify as @xmath567774 .    also seen in the nebular spectrum",
    "is a `` plateau '' of emission between @xmath57 .",
    "this emission is due largely to iron - peak elements ( primarily [ ] , and some [ ] and [ ] ) , which is usually only observed with this strength in the late - time spectra of sne ia . unlike sne ia , however , here the [ ] lines are weak .    in figure  [",
    "fig : oiprofiles ] ( left ) , emission line profiles of sn2012au s most prominent late - time spectral features are shown .",
    "there are real differences among the emission line profiles across elements and their ions .",
    "specific features of note include : ( 1 ) the [ ] , , and ] lines are not symmetric about zero velocity and exhibit higher expansion velocities than [ ] , and ( 2 ) the and [ ] lines indicate two distinct velocity regions in the ejecta .",
    "the relative strengths of narrow lines from coincident host galaxy emission in the nebular spectra were measured to estimate the explosion site metallicity using the method described in @xcite . from the n2 diagnostic of @xcite , we meausure an oxygen abundance of @xmath58 with uncertainty 0.2 dex . adopting a solar metallicity of @xmath59 @xcite , the measurement indicates that sn  2012au exploded in an environment of super - solar metallicity around @xmath60 .",
    "this metallicity is significantly higher than any of the broad - lined sn ic host galaxies from untargeted surveys @xcite .",
    "three epochs of low - resolution , near - infrared spectra spanning 0.82 to 2.51 @xmath61 m were obtained using the foldedport infrared echellette ( fire ) spectrograph on the 6.5-m magellan baade telescope @xcite . the low dispersion prism used in combination with a @xmath62 slit yielded a spectral resolution @xmath63 in @xmath64-band .",
    "data were reduced following standard procedures ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) using a custom - developed idl pipeline ( firehose ) .",

    "absorptions around both the @xmath561.083@xmath61 m and @xmath562.05@xmath61 m lines support the identification of made in the optical spectra .",
    "the minima of these absorptions shift toward longer wavelengths in the later epochs , and the absorption around 1@xmath61 m grows in strength as the 2@xmath61 m absorption fades .",
    "this suggests that the strength diminishes as other ions possibly including and gradually dominate the 1@xmath61 m absorption as time passes .    between @xmath66 and @xmath67d , the full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of strong emission features associated with the @xmath561.503@xmath61 m and @xmath561.317@xmath61 m lines narrow from approximately 5700  to 2000 .",
    "the presence of these lines and the similarity of their velocity distribution to the feature around 7775    support our identification of it being associated with @xmath567774 ( figure  [ fig : oiprofiles ] , left ) .",
    "our uv / optical and near - infrared observations of sn2012au show it to be a slow - evolving energetic supernova with a number of rarely observed late - time emission properties .",
    "sn2012au s plateau of iron emission lines , intermediate - width @xmath567774 emission , persistent p - cyg absorption features , and prolonged brightness almost one year after explosion are not observed in the majority of late - time spectra of sne ib / c ( figure  [ fig : filledplot ] , top ) .",
    "however , a handful of objects including sn1997dq and 2007bi do share sn2012au s rare blend of late - time properties . aside from some difference in the strength and velocity widths of the fe and mg emissions below @xmath68@xmath69   , above @xmath68@xmath69  emissions from these sne",
    "are almost indistinguishable ( figure  [ fig : filledplot ] , bottom ) . like sn2012au , these objects exhibited slow spectroscopic evolution and slowly declining light curves ( see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite interpreted the long duration of the photospheric phase in sn1997dq and sn1997ef to be the consequence of a sharply defined two - component ejecta distribution made of an inner , high - density region , located inside a much lower - density region of high - velocity ejecta .",
    "this was a scenario that had been previously modeled by @xcite .",
    "mazzali et al",
    ".  concluded that a significant fraction of ni - rich material was associated with velocities below the normal mass cut - off imposed in one - dimensional explosion models and that this signaled the presence of explosion asymmetries .",
    "a similar explanation may be applicable to sn2012au .",
    "the persistent p - cyg absorptions and asymmetries between elements and their ions in the emission line profiles are consistent with expectations of a moderately aspherical explosion .",
    "moreover , the absence of [ ] in the iron plateau region ( figure  [ fig : filledplot ] ) indicates that the density of the fe - rich region is high and likely clumped .",
    "thus , it is possible this asphericity was jet - driven , since models have demonstrated that jetted explosions can significantly alter density profiles and @xmath3ni distributions , especially in the central region @xcite .",
    "the presence of the density - sensitive line @xmath567774 and its velocity width is especially noteworthy . in the cases of sn2012au and sn2007bi , the center of",
    "the distribution sits in the middle of an emission gap of the [ ] 6300 , 6364 profile ( figure  [ fig : oiprofiles ] , right ) .",
    "this , along with the 1.503@xmath61 m feature in the near - infrared , is suggestive of an o- and mg - rich region with densities that are collisionally quenching some of the [ ] 6300 , 6364 emission .",
    "on the one hand , it seems unlikely that sne with very different peak luminosities and light curves can share progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms ( figure  [ fig : lcurves ] , right ) .",
    "sn2007bi was a superluminous ( @xmath70mag ) explosion that ejected some @xmath71 of radioactive @xmath3ni , and was associated with a 200 @xmath72 progenitor ( zams ) located in a low metallicity dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "these properties are very different from sn2012au , which was far less luminous ( @xmath73mag ) , produced an order of magnitude less @xmath3ni , and was located in a nearby flocculent spiral we estimate to have super - solar metallicity .",
    "moreover , we find that a comparison of geneva stellar evolution models @xcite to results from a preliminary analysis of pre - explosion _ hubble space telescope _ images of the region encompassing sn2012au @xcite places loose limits on the progenitor star as likely being @xmath74 .    despite these differences , however , the combination of observed optical properties shared between these sne is still suggestive of a unified explosion mechanism .",
    "if a connection between these objects exists , then one of the three currently favored energy mechanisms of slsne powering their slow light curves should extend to sn2012au .",
    "one late - time mechanism is interaction with circumstellar material .",
    "although no narrow emission lines ( fwhm @xmath75 ) have been detected , interaction with h - poor circumstellar shells from pulsational pair - instability sne could potentially be applicable @xcite . favoring against this ,",
    "however , is that sn2012au s radio light curves and sed evolution are most consistent with blast wave interaction with a steady , homogeneous wind ( kamble et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "another mechanism is injection of energy from a magnetar , but the presence of strong iron emission , as observed in sn2012au , could be problematic for this scenario @xcite .    a straightforward understanding of sn2012au s light curve is radioactive @xmath3ni . the rise and fall of the light curve at photospheric epochs , and the subsequent slow decline of the light curve at the rate of @xmath76 mag d@xmath36 up until @xmath77d ,",
    "reasonably follow predictions of ni - co decay ( figure  [ fig : lcurves ] ) .",
    "possible origins for the above average @xmath3ni production may be either a pair instability explosion or fe core collapse of a massive progenitor .",
    "a pair - instability explosion is unlikely given that the progenitor mass and metallicity we estimate for sn2012au are outside theoretical limits ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , fe core collapse is the prime candidate .",
    "sn2012au s exceptionally high energies suggest that the explosion may have been aided by magnetohydrodynamic jets brought about by rapid rotation @xcite .",
    "we have shown that sn2012au is an energetic ( @xmath78erg ) explosion having a rarely observed combination of late - time properties that suggest a link between subsets of energetic and h - poor sne and slsne .",
    "these events , which extend over a large range of absolute magnitudes ( @xmath7 mag ) , appear to be observationally connected by a slow spectroscopic evolution expressed by persistent p - cyg absorptions , intermediate - width ( @xmath55 ) @xmath567774 emission approximately a year after explosion , and slowly declining light curves .",
    "we conclude that they may be unified in a single framework involving the core collapse of a massive progenitor and a subsequent asymmetric explosion .",
    "we thank an anonymous for informed suggestions that improved the manuscript , and the harvard college observatory for supporting the astronomy100 class who were first to classify sn2012au .",
