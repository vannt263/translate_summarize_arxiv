    "recently , topological semimetals have been among the hottest topics in condensed matter physics , including graphene , weyl semimetals , and the surface states of topological insulators and superconductors @xcite .",
    "this may be attributed to not only their potential applications based on their exotic transport properties , but also broad interests of anomalous currents in condensed matter physics , quantum field theory anomalies , and topological characters of these gapless modes @xcite .",
    "as is known , gapless fermi points in topological semimetals can be classified by their topological charges with respect to their symmetries @xcite .",
    "although various investigations have been made on phenomena and classifications of these topological points , implications of the topological charges to quantum field theories are still badly awaited to be explored , which is obviously of fundamental importance and interdisciplinary interest .",
    "mainly motivated by this , here we first establish a general quantitative connection between the topological character of topological fermi points and the topological terms with non - perturbative discrete coefficients in its effective response theory , being coupled to external sources that may be gauge or sigma fields .",
    "these topological terms correspond usually to anomalous transport properties of these fermi points , and are related to quantum field theory anomalies @xcite .",
    "for instance , in weyl semimetals and the a - phase of 3he , there are weyl points with nontrivial chern numbers as their topological charges , which leads to the abelian chiral anomaly in the @xmath0-response theory with anomalous currents @xcite .",
    "we then make important applications of our general theory to the response theories for disordered fermi points with nontrivial topological charges using the replica approach @xcite . on one hand , various disorders are ubiquitous in most real materials , while , on the other hand , as we will see , anomalies of non - abelian gauge theories are naturally related to such condensed matter problems @xcite . as our main results , the integer topological charges ( @xmath1 ) of fermi points in the complex symmetry classes of a and aiii in the altland - zirnbauer ( az ) classification @xcite is rigorously shown to lead to the wess - zumino terms ( wz terms ) at level @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "for the class a , the emergence of the wz terms is related to the parity anomaly in odd dimensions @xcite ; while for the class aiii , it is associated with the non - abelian anomaly in even dimensions @xcite .",
    "finally , we also address the qualitative relationship of topological charges in the eight real az classes to the topological terms with discrete coefficients . while such topological terms have been indicated to have important consequences in the nonlinear sigma models(nl@xmath2ms ) @xcite and argued to appear in various systems @xcite , such as the disordered boundaries of topological insulators  @xcite , we here identify unambiguously their origins for the fermi points as the corresponding topological charges .",
    "let @xmath3 be a set of ( hermitian ) bounded operators in a hilbert space , which are parametrized by @xmath4 in a euclidean space and can be regarded as a mapping from @xmath4 space to linear transformations .",
    "we assume that there are gapless points inside a finite region with zero eigenvalue , namely the spectrum gap opens far away from the origin of the @xmath4 space .",
    "for instance , with regard to the band structure of a solid , the operators are just hamiltonians @xmath5 in the brillouin zone , while for a quantum field theory with only quadratic terms in the euclidean formulation , the operators are the lagrangian density @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 and @xmath8 are two such operator distributions , whose dimensions may be different .",
    "stable _ equivalence between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is defined in the following way . after adding arbitrary numbers of trivial gapped bands to @xmath11 , namely @xmath12 with @xmath13 ,",
    "if @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be smoothly deformed to each other without closing the gap far away from the origin of the @xmath4 space , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are _ stably _ equivalent , @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "note that we are actually defining asymptotic stable topological configurations for a operator distribution .",
    "if a set of symmetries of the operator distributions are required for the smooth deformations , then the two @xmath17 s are said to be _ stably _ equivalent under the symmetries .",
    "for such an @xmath3 , we can choose an @xmath18 in the @xmath19-dimensional @xmath4 space far away from the gapless region , on which @xmath3 is gapped , and define a topological charge valued in an abelian group ( for instance , @xmath20 or @xmath21 ) by @xmath22-theory @xcite .",
    "two @xmath17 s of the same topological charge are stably equivalent .",
    "for the ten az symmetry classes , distinct collections of stably equivalent gapless hamiltonians in every az class are identified by their topological charges that are symmetry - related topological invariants formulated on the gapped spheres enclosin of the gapless regions from the transverse dimensions in @xmath4 space @xcite .",
    "now we are ready to develop in general a topological response theory of a quadratic quantum field theory in the euclidean formulation , @xmath23 where @xmath6 has nontrivial topological charge @xmath1 , which is coupled to an external source field @xmath24 corresponding to some long - distance degree of freedom compared with the ultraviolet cutoff of the theory . for a gauge theory ,",
    "@xmath24 is just the gauge field , while for a sigma model , @xmath24 is in some target manifold , for instance @xmath25 , @xmath26 or some more complicated ones we will meet soon .",
    "the low - energy effective theory is given by integrating over the fermionic fields , @xmath27}{\\mathrm{det\\mathcal{l}(k)}}=\\sum_{j}\\lambda_j s^{(j)}[q],\\label{eff}\\ ] ] namely @xmath28=\\sum_{j}\\lambda_j s^{(j)}[q]$ ] , where @xmath29 is the coefficient of the term @xmath30 , which is a product of @xmath31s and derivatives of @xmath31 .",
    "we consider the family of terms @xmath32 $ ] that are originated from the stable topological property of @xmath6 , and therefore are invariant under the smooth deformations of @xmath6 specified by the stable equivalence in the previous paragraph , noting that adding trivial bands such as @xmath33 does not affect the effective theory of eq.([eff ] ) . in general @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is just the abelian group of integers modulo @xmath36 with the convention that @xmath37 .",
    "since @xmath38 can always be diagonally blocked as @xmath39 according to the group @xmath34 with @xmath38 corresponding to @xmath35 after smooth deformations , we find that @xmath40=\\sum_\\alpha \\lambda_\\alpha s_{top}^{\\alpha}[q],\\ ] ] noting that the direct sum is translated to addition from the left side to the right of eq.([eff ] ) .",
    "accordingly , it is expected that @xmath41 is a function of @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath43 , which is actually proportional to @xmath44 : @xmath45 with @xmath46 being a constant .",
    "this is because that an @xmath3 of topological charge @xmath47 can always be smoothly deformed to be a multiple of @xmath1 identical gapless @xmath9 s with each having a unit topological charge , @xmath48 , after adding sufficient number of trivial bands .",
    "thus , as a general theoretical observation , it is found that @xmath40=\\sum_\\alpha\\nu_\\alpha s_{top}^\\alpha[q ] , \\label{top - term}\\ ] ] where each @xmath46 has been absorbed into @xmath49 for convenience .",
    "eq.([top - term ] ) is a general quantitative relation between the topological charges of fermi points and topological terms of non - perturbative discrete coefficients , serving as one of our main results .",
    "we now make several comments on eq.([top - term ] ) .",
    "first , each generator for the @xmath22-group may lead to a topological term of eq.([top - term ] ) with a discretely valued coupling constant being proportional to the corresponding topological charge .",
    "such terms usually have some topological meanings .",
    "for instance , in a gauge theory candidates may be chern - simons terms for non - abelian groups with the quantization of coupling constant given by the gauge invariance , or chern characters characterizing different topological classes of gauge equivalent configurations classified by an abelian group with twisted components @xcite . for an nl@xmath2 m , wz and @xmath50-@xmath51 terms are naturally such terms , with the quantization of coupling constants given by definitions @xcite .",
    "secondly , the regularization of the quantum field theory in eq.([eff ] ) is required to respect the topological property of @xmath38 specified by the stable equivalence .",
    "a normal pauli - villa regulator is applicable , since it adds only very massive propagators corresponding to trivial pairs of gapped bands that are allowed by stable topological equivalence .",
    "now we apply eq.([top - term ] ) to the nl@xmath2ms of topological fermi points with disorders through the replica trick , starting with the class a that possesses no any discrete symmetry .",
    "as is known , nontrivial topological points in the class a can exist only in odd dimensions , @xmath52 , due to the bott periodicity @xcite .",
    "the corresponding topological charge @xmath53 of a fermi point is given as the chern number of the berry bundle of occupied bands on the gapped @xmath54-dimensional sphere enclosing the fermi point in @xmath4 space@xcite .",
    "for example , a formula for calculating the topological charge of the weyl point @xmath55 is given by @xmath56=\\frac{1}{24\\pi^2}\\int_{s^3}\\mathrm{tr}(g_{w}dg_{w}^{-1}(\\omega , k))^3 , \\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the imaginary green s function , and the @xmath58 is a three - dimensional sphere chosen in @xmath59 space enclosing the gapless points . in the class",
    "a , the sigma field @xmath60 can describe the low - energy degrees of freedom near a saddle point of the mean - field theory in the standard replica method , where @xmath61 denotes the number of replicated systems .",
    "the topological term in eq.([top - term ] ) for a gapless @xmath62 with an integer topological charge @xmath63 is the wz term at level @xmath53 , which can be written as @xmath64=\\nu_{a}c_{d}\\int_{d^{d+1 } } \\mathrm{tr}\\tilde{q}(d\\tilde{q})^{d+1},\\label{wz - a}\\ ] ] based on a rigorous analysis to be detailed from the next paragraph , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 is a continuous extension of @xmath24 along the parameter @xmath67 $ ] with @xmath68 and @xmath69 being constant . since the homotopy group @xmath70 , the extension is always possible .",
    "accordingly , the original real space is extended to the @xmath71-dimensional disk @xmath72 , whose boundary @xmath73 is assumed to be the original real space after compactification .",
    "the difference of the values of eq.([wz - a ] ) for two extensions is @xmath74 with the integer @xmath75 being the winding number difference of the two extensions recalling that @xmath76 , which justifies that the wz - term is well defined @xcite . in particular , the coefficient of a wz term can only take discrete values labelled by its level @xmath77 , which is perfectly in consistence with a fact that the topological charge as a topological invariant is an integer , considering that @xmath78 in eq.([wz - a ] ) .",
    "it is noted that eq.([wz - a ] ) can be argued from the boundary - bulk correspondence of a disordered @xmath79-dimensional chern insulator @xcite .    to prove eq.([wz - a ] ) , as what we discussed above eq.([top - term ] ) , it is sufficient to consider merely the case for the unit topological charge @xmath80 , which can be realized by dirac type hamiltonian , @xmath81 with @xmath82 being @xmath83 dirac matrices , satisfying @xcite@xmath84 we adopt the hamiltonian of a weyl point @xmath85 with @xmath86 to exemplify the proof , and it is straightforward to see its validity in any odd dimensions . the sigma field can be explicitly expressed as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 is the third pauli matrix acting on the retarded - advanced space . before evaluating the functional determinant in eq.([eff ] ) , it is useful to express the wz action in terms of @xmath90 .",
    "it is straightforward , although tedious , to check that @xmath91 which implies that the wz action for unit @xmath53 , in terms of @xmath90 , can be written explicitly in the original real space @xmath58 as @xmath92 for brevity , we define the projectors @xmath93 for the advanced and retarded spaces and @xmath94 , accordingly the action is translated to be @xmath95-s_{cs}[ap_{- } ] ) , \\label{cs - form}\\ ] ] where @xmath96=\\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\int_{s^3}\\mathrm{tr}[ada+\\frac{2}{3}(a)^3]\\ ] ] is the chern - simons ( cs ) term .",
    "the chern - simons expression has been derived in studying a single disordered weyl point for a weyl semimetal , seemingly without realizing it to be actually a wz term @xcite .",
    "now our aim is to deduce eq.([cs - form ] ) from the functional determinant @xmath97 with @xmath98 , recalling eq.([eff ] ) with @xmath99 in this case . after a unitary transformation we have @xmath100 with @xmath101 as a propagator and @xmath102 as a vertex .",
    "the regulator may lead to additional modifications @xcite , which do not affect the present discussions .",
    "so the effective theory is given by a summation of one - loop feynman diagrams , @xmath103=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^n}{n}\\mathrm{tr}(g(\\delta , k)i\\slashed a)^n.\\ ] ] it is well - known that the cs terms , eq.([cs - form ] ) , that we are searching for are related to the parity anomaly in odd dimensions @xcite , which provides us a clue to derive them from the feynman diagrams , analogous to the derivation of the cs term for electromagnetic response of a @xmath104-dimensional chern insulator@xcite , but with extra complications and new interpretations .",
    "considering that @xmath105 encodes low - energy freedoms of small momentum @xmath106 , a term with the same form of eq.([cs - form ] ) can be collected from the two - vertex loop and three - vertex one , @xmath107s_{cs}[ap_{+}]+in[g_{-}]s_{cs}[ap_{-}],\\label{cs - temp}\\ ] ] where @xmath108 , and @xmath109=\\frac{1}{24\\pi^2}\\int_{m}\\mathrm{tr}(gdg^{-1})^3\\ ] ] is an integration over the whole momentum space @xmath110 . to see the topological origin of eq.([cs - temp ] ) , let us regard @xmath111 as the given values of @xmath112 , and therefore viewed in @xmath59 space the momentum spaces of @xmath113 are two parallel three - dimensional surfaces @xmath114 sandwiching the weyl point as shown in fig.([weyl - point ] )",

    "thus , its nl@xmath2 m for disorders has the term of eq.([wz - a ] ) with @xmath121 as a nontrivial application of our result , although direct derivation of the response theory in the quadratic case is extremely difficult .",

    "thus we find that @xmath281 can achieve the interpolation , and through two steps of smooth deformations , the quadratic fermi point with topological charge 2 can be transformed continuously to a doublet of weyl fermi points with the same chirality .",
