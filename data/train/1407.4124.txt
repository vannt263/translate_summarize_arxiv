    "when cooled down to low temperatures , materials normally develop a variety of different orders such as magnetism or superconductivity . however , sufficiently severe quantum fluctuations may prevent the formation of any type of symmetry - breaking order  even at absolute zero  leading to a liquid - like ground state . in the case of spinful quantum systems , such  spin liquid \" phases@xcite have attracted enormous interest in recent years .",
    "spin liquids come in many flavors and can support either gapless or fully gapped spin excitations ; importantly , however , they are always far from featureless .",
    "for instance , gapped spin liquids are not just characterized by the absence of spontaneously broken symmetries , but also by the existence of fractionalized spinon excitations.@xcite in such states the well - known concept of conventional symmetry breaking is replaced by topological order associated with long - range quantum entanglement.@xcite    in recent years , mounting experimental evidence suggests that spin liquids could be realized in strongly frustrated magnetic materials , e.g. , in the kagome lattice compound herbertsmithite.@xcite furthermore , novel classes of magnetic compounds with strong spin - orbit coupling such as iridium oxides have opened a new arena in this field of research .",
    "generally , spin - orbit coupling breaks su(2 ) spin - rotation symmetry , which may generate additional frustration effects leading to exotic magnetic or non - magnetic spin phases.@xcite prominent examples are the iridate compounds na@xmath2iro@xmath3 and li@xmath2iro@xmath3 ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) where strong spin - orbit coupling has been proposed to realize the kitaev spin model , which is known to harbor a spin liquid.@xcite in contrast to many other more conventional systems , where spin - orbit coupling constitutes a small relativistic perturbation that may at first pass be ignored , a realistic description of such materials needs to take into account su(2 ) spin - symmetry breaking .",
    "the systematic investigation of the effects of strong spin - orbit coupling on spin - liquid phases is the purpose of this paper .    since spin liquids",
    "are inherently strongly coupled quantum systems , their theoretical investigation represents a major challenge in condensed matter physics . given a generic spin hamiltonian , the unambiguous identification of a spin liquid ground state is not possible by presently available analytical means .",
    "numerical approaches on the other hand , while certainly invaluable , tend to be limited in their applicability . instead of trying to solve a spin model",
    ", one can alternatively pursue a more ` universal ' strategy : identifying all allowed spin liquid states based on a system s symmetries , which can yield valuable insights in the ultimate quest for experimental realization .",
    "the projective symmetry - group ( psg ) method first proposed by wen@xcite represents one powerful way of systematically classifying possible spin liquids for a given quantum spin system .",
    "this approach makes use of a fermionic parton@xcite ( spinon ) description for spin operators and imposes a constraint on the total number of fermions on each site ( extensions of the method have also been developed for schwinger bosons@xcite ) .",
    "depending on the specific symmetries present , the resulting fermionic hamiltonian can be mean - field decoupled in various ways , leading to a quadratic model that can be treated analytically .",
    "after a gutzwiller projection onto the physically occupied subspace , one obtains a physical trial spin wavefunction . while in general a mean - field ansatz partially breaks the local su(2 ) gauge freedom of the fermionic parton fields , the remaining gauge group determines the nature of gauge fluctuations around a mean - field solution .",
    "the effects of gauge fluctuations , possibly destabilizing a spin liquid state , can be subtle .",
    "for example , if the gauge structure is u(1 ) , it has been argued that gauge fluctuations can drive a topological state into a conventional magnetically ordered phase.@xcite on the other hand , there are also cases where u(1 ) spin liquids in two dimensions are found to be stable.@xcite to avoid subtleties associated with gauge fluctuations , we restrict our analysis to the simplest case of @xmath0 spin liquids , where all gauge excitations are gapped . in this situation",
    "a spin - liquid solution faithfully describes a physical quantum spin phase that should be stable beyond mean - field treatment .",
    "so far the psg method has been applied to various two - dimensional systems such as spins on the square@xcite , triangular@xcite , honeycomb@xcite , and kagome lattices@xcite .",
    "even three dimensional systems may be treated.@xcite the psg method typically identifies a large number of @xmath0 spin liquids . for square - lattice systems preserving su(2 ) spin symmetry as well as all spatial symmetries and time reversal ,",
    "wen originally identified 272 @xmath0 phases.@xcite we note that ref .   introduced a related classification scheme that also employs projective representations of symmetries",
    "this approach does not rely on a specific parton construction but directly considers the action of projective symmetries on anyonic excitations , leading to a coarser classification .",
    "most of the preceding works considered spin-_isotropic _ models ; systematic studies that explore the case with broken su(2 ) spin symmetry are , by contrast , relatively scarce ( for some interesting examples see refs .   and  ) . in this work",
    "we generalize previous studies and classify @xmath0 spin liquids on the square lattice when su(2 ) spin symmetry is lifted strongly by spin - orbit interactions . naively , one might expect that the reduced number of symmetries also reduces the number of spin liquid solutions .",
    "this intuition may be justified by the results of a psg analysis on the square lattice where the removal of all point - group symmetries obliterates the aforementioned 272 states leaving just 16 phases.@xcite here , however , we find quite the opposite : lifting the su(2 ) spin symmetry increases the number of spin liquids from 272 in the spin - isotropic case to @xmath4 .",
    "most strikingly , the 1488 new states exist _ solely _ because su(2 ) symmetry is broken , i.e. , they have no analogue in su(2)-symmetric spin systems .",
    "[ we note that eight of these 1488 states still fulfill a projective version of the su(2 ) spin symmetry and should therefore rather be added to the 272 solutions ; see ref .  .",
    "for simplicity , however , we neglect such subtleties in the following and treat continuos spin symmetries non - projectively . ]    the dramatic refinement of the @xmath0 spin liquid classification upon breaking su(2 ) spin symmetry can be understood as follows . in the absence of continuous spin rotation symmetry spin liquids need to fulfill an _",
    "additional _ symmetry corresponding to invariance under spatial reflection about the two - dimensional lattice plane ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this symmetry operation does not transform the positions of the lattice sites but still rotates the spins . while in spin - isotropic systems",
    "a spin rotation is trivial , the reflection may act nontrivially in the absence of su(2 ) spin symmetry .",
    "this new symmetry condition leads to additional combinations of spin - liquid solutions , effectively increasing their number .",
    "we emphasize that this conclusion is quite general and is expected to refine the psg classification in any two - dimensional system with @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "the increased richness of spin - liquid solutions has some remarkable consequences .",
    "the structure of the mean - field anstze as obtained by the psg approach generally supports @xmath1 triplet pairing for the spinons which may , in turn , lead to gapless majorana edge states .",
    "this type of pairing is not possible in spin - isotropic systems . solving the mean - field hamiltonians on a cylinder ,",
    "we indeed identify various @xmath0 spin - liquid phases with a gapped , topologically nontrivial bulk supporting gapless edge states .",
    "even though spin - liquid solutions differ in the number of boundary modes and may have elaborate edge - state structures , we find that their topological protection can be traced back to simple @xmath0 topological indices based on time - reversal invariance .",
    "furthermore , we identify various spin liquids where additional lattice symmetries are needed to protect the gaplessness of the boundary modes .",
    "this demonstrates that spinon band structures resembling the recently proposed topological crystalline superconductors@xcite may be realized in magnetic compounds and accessed theoretically using the psg method .",
    "such an interplay between topology and symmetry has been described in the general framework of  symmetry enriched topological phases\"@xcite : if a topologically ordered system has additional global symmetries , new classes of distinct quantum phases can emerge . in our case , many spin liquids have the remarkable property that a non - trivial topology is implemented in _ two _ different ways , via the existence of deconfined spinon excitations and by a symmetry - protected topological spinon band structure , similar to refs .  .",
    "we structure the remainder of the paper as follows . in sec .",
    "[ su2 ] we briefly revisit the case of spin - isotropic systems and summarize some fundamentals of the psg approach . a classification of spin liquids when su(2 ) spin symmetry is broken down to u(1 ) is discussed in sec .  [ u1 ] .",
    "we then turn in sec .",
    "[ no_symmetry ] to a complete classification of spin liquids when spin symmetry is maximally lifted and discuss the modifications of the psg method required for such a generalization .",

    "there we particularly focus on the description of boundary modes and their topological protection .",

    "two appendices list the explicit implementations of projective symmetries within all classes of @xmath0 spin liquids .",
    "before discussing the more complicated situation where su(2 ) spin symmetry is lifted , we first revisit the psg classification of spin liquids on a square lattice in the spin - isotropic case.@xcite our starting point is a general spin-1/2 hamiltonian of the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 label the square - lattice sites and @xmath9 denotes pairs of sites .",
    "the ellipsis indicates that interactions with more than two spin operators may be present as well .",
    "we emphasize that at this point we do not need to further specify the hamiltonian .",
    "the only requirements are that @xmath10 is spin - isotropic , time - reversal invariant and respects all lattice symmetries .",

    "a coupling between the two sets of bands can be achieved by a term @xmath401 ( which also breaks @xmath59 ) or by a term @xmath418 ( which also breaks @xmath55 ) .",
    "while the symmetry protection of edge states against a coupling between different momentum sectors turns out to be rather robust , the associated topological index @xmath384 only remains valid if a coupling of boundary modes within the same set of bands is also forbidden by symmetry .",
    "table  [ psg101_table ] shows that this is indeed the case : there is no linear combination of @xmath338 and @xmath371 which satisfies all symmetries .",
    "interestingly , since the term @xmath419 only breaks @xmath55 but no other symmetries , we identify reflection @xmath55 to be responsible for the protection .",
    "this also implies that for a cylinder without mirror symmetry ( i.e. , when the edges are along an arbitrary direction ) the term @xmath419 is allowed by symmetries , turning the system into a trivial ( spinon ) superconductor .    in summary",

    "edge states may only be gapped out by either breaking @xmath62 , @xmath53 , and @xmath59 simultaneously , or by violating @xmath55 . hence , even though the mean - field ansatz is similar to the one in the previous section , the projective symmetries act very differently .",
    "since the edge modes are entirely gapped out by only breaking @xmath55 , the system is again similar to the previously introduced topological crystalline insulator.@xcite +      in a final example , we briefly illustrate that even more complex edge - state structures are possible . considering the mean - field amplitudes @xmath421 the hamiltonian reads as @xmath422 with    @xmath423    where all lagrange multipliers yet again vanish . remarkably , the two spin sectors have chern numbers @xmath424 and the edge - state spectrum for the system on a cylinder exhibits _ four _ pairs of counter - propagating majorana modes , see fig .

    "@xmath425 $ ] one obtains four copies of degenerate sets of bands which are all characterized by chern numbers @xmath426 ( @xmath427 is calculated in one quarter of the original brillouin zone ) . in analogy to the previous sections , this allows us to define a modified @xmath0 topological invariant @xmath392 . since the system exhibits four right - moving ( @xmath428 ) and four left - moving majorana modes ( @xmath429 ) at zero energy , there are in total 16 coupling terms @xmath430 with @xmath431 .",
    "the index @xmath392 only represents a topological invariant of the system if there is no linear combination of couplings @xmath430 that satisfies all symmetries .",
    "given the large number of terms , we will not present a detailed symmetry analysis here , but conclude mentioning that the band structure is indeed topologically non - trivial , i.e. , @xmath384 .",

    "a detailed analysis with an enlarged unit cell ( now comprising four sites in @xmath51-direction ) shows that based on a modified @xmath0 index , the band structure may be classified as topologically non - trivial . ]",
    "the inception of topological electronic band insulators and superconductors highlighted the dramatic qualitative role that spin - orbit coupling can play in governing a material s physical properties .",
    "as the field enters maturity , increasing attention is being focused on strongly correlated analogues .",
    "magnetic insulators that feature an interplay between strong spin - orbit coupling and frustration comprise prime candidates for the latter  particularly given the synthesis of new classes of compounds including the iridates that sharply violate su(2 ) spin symmetry .",
    "these systems can potentially host spin - liquid ground states where fractionalized spinon excitations ( rather than electrons ) exhibit topologically nontrivial band structures ; a proof of concept has indeed been demonstrated in several earlier works , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "compared to weakly correlated band insulators , however , our understanding of how spin - orbit coupling impacts spin - liquid physics remains in its infancy .",
    "in this work we have carried out a detailed psg classification of @xmath0 spin liquids on a square lattice when su(2 ) spin symmetry is maximally broken .",
    "these systems , while not of immediate experimental relevance , provide an ideal setting in which to explore the consequences of spin - orbit coupling on spin liquid phases since the su(2)-invariant limit is so well - studied@xcite . within our psg analysis",
    "we identify 1488 @xmath0 spin liquids that _ only _ occur in the su(2)-broken case and have no analogue among the 272 spin - isotropic @xmath0 phases found in previous works .",
    "[ technically , as noted earlier eight of these 1488 states still preserve a projective version of su(2 ) spin symmetry ; see ref .  .",
    "] most strikingly , we have shown that these 1488 spin states naturally possess @xmath1 pairing in the spinons leading in many cases to topologically non - trivial band structures associated with the existence of spinon edge states .",
    "such spin phases hence realize the remarkable situation where a non - trivial topology occurs in two different contexts , primarily in the appearance of deconfined spinons as effective quasiparticles and secondarily through a topological spinon band structure.@xcite the @xmath0 gauge structure of our model hamiltonians guarantees that gauge fluctuations emerging in a treatment beyond mean - field theory are fully gapped and should not qualitatively change the low - energy properties of the system.@xcite    we have discussed various examples of mean - field anstze in selected psg representations and investigated the origin of the topological edge - state protection .",
    "our examples reveal a variety of different edge - state structures with up to four counter - propagating pairs of gapless majorana modes .",
    "we expect that more involved mean - field anstze may even possess higher numbers of boundary modes .",
    "our analysis shows that many band structures can be characterized by a @xmath0 topological index which , however , may differ from the @xmath0 invariant for topological insulators . while our topological classification is built upon time - reversal symmetry , many psg representations also require the fulfillment of additional lattice symmetries in order to retain the stability of boundary modes .",
    "hence , we identify various spin liquids that may be referred to as  topological crystalline spinon superconductors \" .",
    "we have not attempted , however , to develop a unified picture characterizing the topology of all possible band structures .",
    "a more involved task would be to clarify the role of @xmath0 topological indices based _",
    "solely _ on lattice symmetries as considered in refs .  .",
    "other types of topological crystalline band structures could very well be lurking in our psg analysis .",
    "it would be interesting to extend our analysis to other two - dimensional settings such as the kagome lattice , where strong geometric frustration makes the existence of spin - liquid phases in generic spin hamiltonians more likely .",
    "we note that for the kagome lattice a similar psg spin - liquid classification has already been carried out in ref .  .",
    "while this work considers the spin - symmetry breaking effects of dzyaloshinskii - moriya or ising - spin terms , a residual u(1 ) spin symmetry is still preserved . in agreement with our results",
    "it is shown that the psg classification itself remains unchanged when breaking down the spin symmetry to u(1 ) ; the spinon spectrum can , nevertheless , be significantly altered . to the best of our knowledge , a complete psg analysis in the case where",
    "the spin symmetry is maximally lifted has not been performed before .",
    "another interesting extension of our work is the investigation of three - dimensional lattices .",
    "actually this setting promises to offer even richer physics upon including spin - orbit coupling since there one can have stable spin liquids with u(1 ) gauge freedom even if the spinons exhibit a bulk excitation gap ( this is not so in two dimensions ) .",
    "thus spinon cousins of topological superconductors _ and _ insulators@xcite can exist in three dimensions .",
    "a spin liquid phase of the latter type has been proposed in the hyperkagome iridate compound na@xmath432ir@xmath3o@xmath433.@xcite in short , a systematic exploration of three - dimensional spin liquids with topological band structures induced by spin - orbit coupling should consider both u(1 ) and @xmath0 states .    finally , while the model hamiltonians of the present work are formulated in a fermionic parton representation for spins , it would be insightful to identify microscopic _ spin _ hamiltonians that realize some of our phases as ground states .",
    "such hamiltonians may include spin - anisotropic ising couplings @xmath434 , terms of dzyaloshinskii - moriya type @xmath435 , or even contributions with more than two spin operators . by backing out trial spin wavefunctions corresponding to a given spin - liquid ansatz",
    ", extensive variational studies could be employed to find such candidate hamiltonians .",
    "( at this point even mean - field energetics could be illuminating . )",
