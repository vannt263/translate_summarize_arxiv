    "for the two models this is 1.56 and 0.78gyr , respectively .",

    "hence , our partitioning method is independent of stellar population models or other assumptions . for each subsample",
    "we constructed a composite sed by scaling and de - redshifting the observed photometry .",
    "the composite seds are of spectroscopic quality and show spectral features , such as the ( blended ) + +  and h@xmath5+[oiii ] emission lines , the balmer or 4000  breaks , mgii absorption at 2800   , the continuum break at 2640   , and the dust absorption feature at 2175 .",
    "most of these features are not detected in the seds of individual galaxies .",
    "thus , the increased s / n and sampling of the composite seds enable the detection and measurement of spectral features , which would normally require spectroscopic data .",
    "therefore these seds can be used to study the stellar populations and emission line characteristics of typical galaxies in a very detailed way , which is not possible when the photometry of individual galaxies is considered separately . additionally , the shape and linewidth of the  emission line yield an indepedent measure of the photometric redshift errors .",
    "consistent with comparison to spectroscopic redshifts , we find an accuracy of @xmath46 .",
    "in the present work , we measure  and  for all composite seds and compare the full sed shapes with sps models .",
    "most sed types are equally well fit by the @xcite and @xcite sps models .",
    "the exception , however , are post - starburst galaxies . as has previously been shown in @xcite , the @xcite models can not reproduce the full sed shape of post - starburst galaxies simultaneously .",
    "they overpredict the nir luminosity , implying that these models give too much weight to tp - agb stars .",
    "we find that ,  and the best - fit ssfr are all strongly correlated , such that galaxies with shallow breaks have high values for  and are best fit by stellar population models with high ssfrs .",
    "on the other hand , galaxies with strong 4000    breaks have low values for  and are best fit by sps models with low ssfrs .",
    "this is a remarkable result given that the relations are derived without spectroscopy , and solely based on medium - band photometry .",
    "moreover , the  lines provide an independent measure of the stellar populations and confirm the results based on just the continuum shape .",
    "measurements at the targeted redshift range are very challenging with spectroscopy , as the line is shifted to nir wavelengths . at this moment ,",
    "spectroscopic  measurements beyond @xmath47 are only availably for small or biased galaxy samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and consquently our understanding of galaxies at this epoch is primarily based on photometric measurements , which use uncertain stellar population models to interpret the nature of the continuum emission .",
    "the composite seds  for the first time  open up the possibility to efficiently study  emission for large , magnitude - limited galaxy samples , providing a crucial assessment of our photometric studies .",
    "we also study the rest - frame optical morphologies of a subsample of galaxies around @xmath48 for each sed type .",
    "interestingly , we find that with increasing , galaxies appear to change from irregular and clumpy , to fairly regular disks , to regular early - type systems at the highest . strikingly , the most dusty galaxies are typically edge - on disks .",
    "the relation between  and  at @xmath2 is similar to the low - redshift relation , as determined from the sdss galaxy sample .",
    "there may be a slight offset , such that at fixed value for , the  of the @xmath2 galaxies is slightly higher than for the low - redshift galaxies .",
    "we use simple models to interpret this difference , and show that the rate at which the sfr is declining can explain the difference in  at fixed ; specifically , the sfrs in @xmath37 galaxies may decline more gradually than at low redshift .",
    "the elevated  may also be explained by higher black hole accretion rates or higher metallicities at earlier times , or by relatively more obscured hii regions at lower redshift .",
    "it is remarkable that  and  are so tightly correlated , given that  is mostly sensitive to current star formation and  is a measure of the older stellar population , and thus the past star formation .",
    "sps model predictions show that sfhs that decline rapidly after their major burst  such as truncated sfhs or sfhs with short timescales ",
    "predict a steeper decline of  compared to  than what is observed for the galaxies with intermediate to low values of .",
    "the combination of  and  and the best - fit star formation timescales both indicate long star formation timescales of @xmath49gyr ( for a sfh parametrized by @xmath22exp(@xmath50 ) ) for older galaxy types .",
    "this suggests that the suppression of star formation at @xmath7 is generally not an abrupt , but rather a gradual process .",
    "our finding is consistent with the predictions by high - resolution smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations of massive elliptical galaxies starting from @xmath51cdm initial conditions @xcite .",
    "the seds that we presented here can be used for many additional purposes .",
    "for example , we can measure the relative strength of emission lines , the strength of absorption features ( e.g. , mgii at 2800 ) , and constrain the dust extinction curve including the 2175  dust absorption feature .",
    "this paper briefly discussed the morphologies of the different sed types .",
    "a more quantitative analysis , with measurements of sizes and ellipticities will be presented in a future paper .",
    "for example , by comparing the sizes of galaxies in several evolutionary phases , we can assess theories proposed to explain the size growth of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "comparison with other wavelength regimes also offers many interesting possibilities . for instance",
    ", x - ray stacks allow the study of agn demographics among the different types .    due to the low resolution of the nmbs , it is unfortunately not possible to deblend the emission lines h@xmath3 , [ nii ] , and  or h@xmath5 and [ oiii ] .",
    "thus , nir spectroscopy is needed to test our h@xmath3 measurements , to derive emission line ratios , and to study the contribution from agns to the emission line fluxes .",
    "such measurements would also be very valuable to study the metallicities and balmer decrements within and among the different samples .",
    "altogether , our composite seds in combination with follow - up spectroscopy and other wavelength data enable many different studies to better understand the origin and evolution of galaxies .",
    "we thank the members of the nmbs team for their help with the observations and construction of the catalogs , charlie conroy , ryan foley , and jeremiah ostriker for useful discussions , and the cosmos and aegis teams for the release of high - quality multi - wavelength data sets to the community .",

    "<S> we construct a composite sed by de - redshifting and scaling the observed photometry . </S>",
    "<S> this approach increases the signal - to - noise ratio and sampling of galaxy seds and allows for model - independent stellar population studies . </S>",

    "<S> the linewidths indicate a photometric redshift uncertainty of @xmath4 . the composite seds also show the balmer and 4000  breaks , mgii absorption at @xmath02800   , the dust absorption feature at 2175 , and blended + h@xmath5 emission . </S>",

    "<S> this is a reassuring result , as currently most distant stellar population studies are based on just continuum emission . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the relation between  and provides interesting clues to the sfhs of galaxies , as these features are sensitive to different stellar ages . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the correlation between  and  at @xmath2 is similar to @xmath6 , and that the suppression of star formation in galaxies at @xmath7 is generally not abrupt , but a gradual process . </S>"
