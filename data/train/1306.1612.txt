    "in high energy processes at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) predictions of cross sections have very important role . in the general case",
    "the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of initial hadrons , parton - level differential cross sections , and fragmentation functions are three necessary ingredients to calculate cross sections .",
    "fragmentation functions ( ffs ) form the non - perturbative component of the hard scattering process and describe the transition of a parton into the outgoing hadron .",
    "+ the importance of ffs is for model independent predictions of the cross sections at lhc in which a hadron is detected in the outgoing productions depend on ffs .",
    "interest of ffs is found for example in tests of qcd such as theoretical calculations for recent measurements of inclusive production in proton - proton collisions at rhic , and in investigating the origin of the proton spin . in the naive parton model",
    "the ffs are independent of the factorization scale ( depending only on the scaling variable @xmath3 ) but in qcd - improved parton model the scaling violations of ffs remain to be subject to dokshitzer- gribov - lipatov - alteralli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution equations @xcite .",
    "note that ffs can be extracted from fits to data at intermediate to large momentum fractions .",
    "+ ffs are studied in electron - positron annihilation , lepton - hadron and hadron - hadron scattering processes . among all , the @xmath4 annihilation provides a clean environment to determine the fragmentation densities , but without an initial hadron state one can not separate a quark from an anti - quark distributions . since the most precise data from @xmath4 annihilation exists for the production of the lightest charged hadrons ( pion , kaon and proton ) , we are interested in the fragmentation processes of the partons into the pion and kaon in electron - positron annihilation and semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering .",
    "fragmentation functions are included in hadron - production processes in electron - positron annihilation , lepton - proton or nucleus scattering , proton - proton and heavy ions collisions . such processes are important in hadron physics for studying and investigating the origin of the proton spin @xcite and in reported results in refs .",
    "@xcite , the role of ffs to determine the polarized parton distribution functions is pointed out . in the present analysis to determine ffs , we consider semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) asymmetry data along with the data on the @xmath4 annihilation from lep ( aleph , delphi and opal collaborations ) , slac ( sld and tpc collaborations ) , desy ( tasso collaboration ) , kek ( topaz collaboration ) @xcite and very recent babar and belle data at the slac and the kekb @xcite , respectively . there are also some other kinds of new analysis performed by using these new reported data @xcite .",
    "+ there are already several theoretical studies on qcd analysis for ffs which are listed in @xcite , in particular , used parameterizations were widely obtained by kkp and akk collaborations @xcite and kretzer @xcite . as it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are differences between the fragmentation functions of kkp and kretzer , therefore it is convenient to make an error calculation for the fragmentation functions to check the consistency of results . in this regard , an attempt for determining the ffs and their uncertainties has been already done in hkns and dss collaborations  @xcite .",
    "but we have an opportunity to use the asymmetry sidis experimental data from hermes @xcite and compass @xcite which is the first attempt to study how much the asymmetry sidis data are effective for determination of ffs and also their uncertainties .",
    "+ since the decay of top - quark is one of the interesting subjects at lhc we shall make our theoretical predictions for the energy spectrum of @xmath5- and @xmath6-mesons produced in top decay using the ffs obtained from our present work .",
    "we will also compare our predictions with the known results of refs .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : two ] we explain the hadronization process in electron - positron collision by introducing the ffs .",
    "double spin asymmetry in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering processes is defined in this section too . in section  [ sec : three ] we describe our formalism and parametrization form for pion and kaon fragmentation densities .",
    "the global @xmath7 minimization for data is defined in this section .",
    "we also outline the hessian method for assessing the neighborhood of global minimum . in section  [ sec : four ] our formalism to predict the energy distribution of @xmath5 and @xmath6 in top - quark decay is explained .",
    "the full results for pion and kaon ffs and their uncertainties are listed in section  [ sec : five ] .",
    "comparison of our results with experimental data and the other models and also our predictions of energy spectrum of outgoing pion and kaon in top - quark decay are presented in this section .",
    "our conclusion is given in section  [ sec : six ] .",
    "the fragmentation functions are related to the low energy components of the hadron production processes and they form the non - perturbative aspect of qcd . ffs describe the inclusive emission of a hadron from a parton and they can not be precisely calculated by theoretical methods at this stage . the perturbative qcd framework is used to study single - inclusive hadron production in @xmath4 annihilation , lepton - nucleon dis , and hadron - hadron collisions , where the factorization theorem is a strong tool to study such processes .",
    "this theorem states that the cross section can be expressed in terms of perturbatively calculable partonic hard - scattering cross sections , pdfs and ffs in which the two last are related to the low energy components of qcd processes .",
    "the low energy components of qcd processes are universal and they can be used to make predictions .",
    "+ in this section , we explain the theoretical framework relevant for our global qcd analysis of fragmentation functions .",
    "since , in the single - inclusive @xmath8 annihilation processes @xmath9 one should not deal with the uncertainty introduced by pdfs in comparison with the hadron collisions , then the optimal way to determine ffs is to fit them to experimental date extracted from these processes . in the above process , @xmath10 stands for the unobserved jets which are produced along with a detected hadron @xmath11 .",
