    "in previous works @xcite a certain ratio was defined involving the static quadrupole moment of a @xmath10 state in an even - even nucleus and the @xmath4 .",
    "it was defined in such a way so that for a perfect rotor , the ratio was one and for a simple vibrator , the ratio was zero .    in the rotational model the @xmath11 and @xmath4",
    "are described by one parameter , the intrinsic quadrupole moment q@xmath12 .",
    "we will however define two different operational static quadrupole moments .",
    "@xmath13    where    @xmath14    for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 we obtain    @xmath18    the quadrupole ratio is    @xmath19    thus , we have expressed the quadrupole ratio in terms of quantities measured in the laboratory .",
    "for @xmath11 we use the reference of stone @xcite and for b(e2 ) , the tables of raman et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the main difference from the previous works is that we now consider all nuclei for which @xmath11 has been measured . in previous works ,",
    "only light nuclei were considered .",
    "looking at all nuclei , as we do here , will give us a new perspective .",
    "it is much easier to measure @xmath4 than it is to measure @xmath11 .",
    "the values of @xmath20 in raman s table form a concensus made by raman when more than one measurement was made on a nucleus .    for @xmath11",
    ", stone does not present an evaluated result , and wisely so , because there is a wide variation in some cases . what was done in",
    "this work was to select the latest measurement of a given @xmath11 .",
    "of course it is not always true that the latest measurement is the best one .",
    "hence , if later , more definate measurements are made , we will have to alter the figures .",
    "we feel that the large scale impression of the results will still stand .",
    "note that stone s table does not contain measured values of @xmath21 beyond @xmath22pb .",
    "hence in this analysis we can not comment on nuclei beyond doubly magic @xmath9pb such as the actinide nuclei and the transuranic nuclei .",
    "in figure i we present for even - even nuclei the magnitude ofthe quadrupole ratio ( with @xmath23 replaced by k ) and @xmath6 , the ratio of energies . again , in the pure rotation model @xmath5 is equal to 1 and @xmath24 . in a simple vibrational limit",
    "the quadrupole moment would be zero ( i.e. the static quadrupole moment would vanish ) and @xmath25 .    ]    for light nuclei there are several examples where the quadrupole ratio is even larger than one .",
    "there is a midrange region from about 70 to 110 where the quadrupole ratio is around 0.5 and where @xmath6 is between two and three .",
    "this is a region which is about halfway between vibrational and rotational .",
    "then we hit an island 112 and 120 where thhe simple vibrational model is almost realized .",
    "the nuclei in this band include @xmath26sn and @xmath27te .",
    "the ratio here for @xmath11 is almost zero and @xmath6 is close to two .",
    "as we move to heavier nuclei , the rotational model is realized in a band from about 152 to 186 , with the quadrupole ratio close to one and @xmath6 close to 10/3 .",
    "these nuclei include @xmath28nd , @xmath29sn , gd isotopes , @xmath30dy , @xmath31dy , er isotopes , yb isotopes , @xmath32w , most os isotopes , and @xmath33hg .",
    "we can also consider other models .",
    "for example we can use the @xmath34 configuration for @xmath35ca .",
    "this single particle model is the antithesis of the rotational model .",
    "yet it yields a value @xmath36 .",
    "this compares with the experimental value of 1.023 .",
    "we next discuss the signs of the quadrupole ratios . for the light nuclei",
    "there are several cases where the quadrupole ratio is negative ( @xmath37c , @xmath38si , @xmath39s , @xmath40ar , @xmath41ar , @xmath42ti , @xmath43ni , @xmath44ni , @xmath45 ni , and @xmath46ge ) .",
    "it was pointed out by bohr and mottelson that in the absence of a spin - orbit interaction about half the nuclei would be prolate and the other half oblate @xcite .",
    "it is known that the spin orbit force is not as important in the light nuclei as it is for heavier ones , so this is consistent .",
    "we also encounter nuclei with positive values of q(2 + ) as we approach @xmath9pb , namely @xmath47pt , @xmath48hg and @xmath49pb .",
    "it is tempting to refer to these as oblate but more complex analyses are present @xcite , especially for the pt isotopes .",
    "in hartree fock codes , the deformation parameter is defined as @xmath50 where q@xmath12 is the intrinsic quadrupole moment and @xmath51 is the mean square radius of the protons . in the deformed oscillator model the hamiltonian is h=@xmath52 where @xmath53 is the sum of ( 2n@xmath54 + 1/2 ) over all occupied orbits .",
    "if we have axial symmetry h=@xmath55 , we can show that @xmath56    the mottelson conditions are @xmath57 . using them we get @xmath58    we see that we get prolate deformation if @xmath59 is greater than @xmath53 and oblate if @xmath59 is less than @xmath53 .",
    "this work represents an expansion of the 2006 work of robinson et al .",
    "we here consider essentially all nuclei where @xmath11 has been measured .",
    "since that work , there have been other works of relevance e.g. that of bertsch et al .",
    "@xcite in which the gogny interaction was used to calculate @xmath11 and @xmath20 as well as work by sabbey et al .",
    "early works using skyrme h.f . were performed by jaqaman et al .",
    "@xcite who also considered hexadecapole models . recent work by sarriguren et al .",
    "@xcite should be noted as well as the phase transitions in the platinum isotopes by morales et al.@xcite .",
    "they consider the heavier nuclei  isotopes of yb , hf , w , os , and pt  where there are many changes from prolate to oblate .",
    "also mentioned in the 2006 work , zelevinsky and volya @xcite noted that with random matrices they obtained with a high probability that the quadrupole ratio @xmath5 ( as we define it ) is either one or zero .",
    "why this is so is not clear ."
