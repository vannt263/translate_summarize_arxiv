    "two extreme examples of this construction occur when the collection of annuli is empty , in which case we obtain the _ trivial compression body _",

    "it follows ( see  [ csec ] ) that @xmath9 and @xmath17 are isomorphic if and only if each is contained in the other .    the _ compression body graph _ , written @xmath20 , is the graph whose vertices are isomorphism classes of nontrivial @xmath0-compression bodies , and where @xmath21 are adjacent if either @xmath22    the _ mapping class group _ of @xmath8 , written @xmath23 , is the group of isotopy classes of self - homeomorphisms @xmath24 of @xmath0 .",

    "here @xmath29 is the genus of the surface @xmath0 .",
    "note that when @xmath0 is a torus the theorem is false , since then @xmath20 is an infinite graph with no edges .",
    "the action of @xmath23 is faithful except when @xmath0 has genus two , in which case the kernel is generated by the hyperelliptic involution .",
    "this follows from the analogous statement about the action of the mapping class group on the complex of curves , since any simple closed curve @xmath30 on @xmath0 gives a _ small compression body _",
    "@xmath31 $ ] obtained by attaching a two - handle along an annulus framing @xmath30 on @xmath32 , and @xmath23 acts on these small compression bodies via the defining curves , see  [ csec ] .",
    "metrically , the compression body graph is @xmath33-hyperbolic and has infinite diameter .",
    "this follows from as yet unpublished work of maher - schleimer , who study a _",
    "handlebody graph _ that is quasi - isometric to @xmath20 .",
    "we find the fine structure of @xmath20 more natural , but maher - schleimer should be credited as the first to study the notion of distance between handlebodies or compression bodies defined by such graphs .",
    "the compression body graph is an example of a _ comparability graph _",
    ", where an edge joins vertices that are comparable in a partial order . as such , it is _ perfect , _ i.e.  the chromatic and clique numbers of all subgraphs agree .",
    "such graph invariants come up briefly below ; for instance , lemma [ lem : chromatic ] implies that the chromatic and clique numbers of @xmath2 are @xmath34 .",
    "the inspiration for theorem [ main ] is the celebrated theorem of ivanov @xcite , see also luo @xcite , that the automorphism group of the curve graph is @xmath35 . here , the _ curve graph _ is the graph @xmath36 whose vertices are isotopy classes of simple closed curves on @xmath0 , and edges connect isotopy classes that admit disjoint representatives .",
    "ivanov used his theorem to conclude that the isometry group of teichmller space , regarded with the teichmller metric , is also @xmath35 , and that the outer automorphism group of the mapping class group is trivial .",
    "since then , there have been a number of papers proving similar rigidity results for complexes associated to a surface @xmath0 , e.g.  the complex of non - separating curves @xcite , and the pants complex @xcite .",
    "the action of the mapping class group on @xmath20 encodes a wealth of information about the interaction of mapping classes and @xmath3-manifolds .",
    "for instance , an element @xmath37 fixes an @xmath0-compression body @xmath9 if and only if the homeomorphism @xmath38 of @xmath39 extends to a homeomorphism of @xmath4 .",
    "extension into compression bodies has been previously studied by casson - long @xcite , long @xcite , biringer - johnson - minsky @xcite and ackermann @xcite , among others . in studying the cobordism group of surface automorphisms , bonahon (",
    "* prop 5.1 ) shows that when a homeomorphism of a surface @xmath8 extends to a @xmath3-manifold @xmath40 with @xmath41 , it also extends to a @xmath3-manifold in which all the non - periodic action happens on the union of a compression body and an interval bundle .",
    "for the proof of theorem [ main ] , we introduce an auxiliary simplicial complex , which is of independent interest .",
    "the _ torus complex",
    "_ , denoted @xmath42 , is the simplicial complex whose vertices are isotopy classes of non - separating simple closed curves , and where a collection of vertices @xmath43 spans a @xmath44-simplex if there exists a punctured torus @xmath45 such that @xmath46 can be isotoped to be contained in @xmath47 for all @xmath48 .    [ thm : torus - aut ] for @xmath27 , the natural map @xmath49 is a surjection .",
    "in other words , every bijection of the set of non - separating simple closed curves on @xmath0 that preserves when curves lie in a punctured torus is given by a mapping class .",
    "as in theorem [ main ] , this map is an isomorphism except when @xmath0 has genus two , in which case the kernel is generated by the hyperelliptic involution .",
    "the relationship between @xmath42 and @xmath2 is described in the following proof sketch .",
    "we will outline here the proof of the main theorem , modulo results to be proved later . a full proof will be given at the end of the paper in section [ sec : proof ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath50 is an automorphism . in proposition [ prop",
    ": small - invariant ] , we show that @xmath51 preserves the set of small compression bodies @xmath31 $ ] , those that are obtained from @xmath0 by compressing a single curve @xmath52 . moreover , @xmath51 preserves whether the compressing curve is non - separating or separating .",
    "briefly , the idea is that small compression bodies are ( among ) those with small _ height _ , a notion of complexity introduced in ",
    "[ sec : height ] , and that the height of a compression body @xmath4 is encoded in the chromatic number of certain subsets of the link of @xmath53 .",
    "this is the subject of section [ small ] .    in particular , @xmath51 acts on the set of non - separating simple closed curves on @xmath0 .",
    "this action has the property that it preserves when a set of non - separating curves comes from a single punctured torus @xmath45 . when @xmath54 , this is because two non - separating curves @xmath55 lie in a punctured torus if and only if the compression bodies @xmath31 $ ] and @xmath56 $ ] contain a common sub - compression body , while @xmath57 requires an additional argument",
    "this leads us to consider the _",
    "torus complex _ @xmath42 .",
    "section [ torus ] is dedicated to proving theorem [ thm : torus - aut ] and is entirely separate from the rest of the paper .",
    "consequently , the action of @xmath51 on the set of non - separating small compression bodies agrees with the action of mapping class @xmath58 .",
    "we then show that the actions of @xmath51 and @xmath24 agree on all of @xmath2 , using that a compression body is determined by the small compression bodies it contains .",
