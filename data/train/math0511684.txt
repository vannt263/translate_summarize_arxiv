    "global residues were studied by tsikh , gelfond and khovanskii , and later by cattani , dickenstein and sturmfels @xcite .",
    "there are numerous applications of global residues ranging from elimination algorithms in commutative algebra @xcite to integral representation formulae in complex analysis @xcite .",
    "there have been several approaches to the problem of computing the global residue explicitly .",
    "gelfond and khovanskii considered systems with _ generically positioned _ newton polytopes .",
    "the latter means that for any linear function @xmath10 , among the corresponding extremal faces @xmath11 at least one is a vertex . in this case",
    "gelfond and khovanskii found an explicit formula for the global residue as a laurent polynomial in the coefficients of the system @xcite .",
    "in general , the global residue is not a laurent polynomial and one should not expect a closed formula for it .",
    "another approach was taken by cattani and dickenstein in the _ generalized unmixed _ case when all @xmath12 are dilates of a single @xmath6-dimensional polytope ( see @xcite ) .",
    "their algorithm requires computing a certain element in the homogeneous coordinate ring of a toric variety whose _ toric residue _ equals 1 .",
    "then the _ codimension theorem _ for toric varieties @xcite allows global residue computation using grbner bases techniques .",
    "this approach was then extended by dandrea and khetan to a slightly more general _ ample _ case @xcite .",
    "however , it turned out to be a hard ( and still open ) problem to find an element of toric residue  1 for an arbitrary collection of polytopes .",
    "in this paper we present a new algorithm for computing the global residue when @xmath7 are arbitrary @xmath6-dimensional polytopes ( see section  [ s : algorithm ] ) .",
    "the proof of its correctness is in the spirit of cattani and dickenstein s arguments , but avoids the toric residue problem .",
    "it relies substantially on the toric euler ",
    "jacobi theorem due to khovanskii  @xcite .",
    "also in our algorithm we replace grbner bases computations with solving a linear system .",
    "this gives an expression of the global residue as a quotient of two determinants .",
    "the same idea was previously used by dandrea and khetan in @xcite .",
    "there is an intimate relation between the global residue and polynomial interpolation . in the classical case",
    "this was understood already by kronecker . in section  [ s : sparseinterpol ]",
    "we show how the toric euler ",
