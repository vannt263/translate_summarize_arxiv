    "there is compelling evidence that massive black holes ( mbhs ) exist in the centers of most galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is believed that galaxies grow by successive mergers , during which the two mbhs sink to the center of the newly formed galaxy by dynamical friction and form a `` hard '' binary mbh ( bmbh ) @xcite with a semi - major axis of @xmath1r_{h}(m_{12})/4\\,,\\label{e : a_h}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the mass of the binary , @xmath3 is the mass ratio and @xmath4 is the radius of dynamical influence of the bmbh , @xcite . the threshold semi - major axis for a hard bmbh is sometimes defined in terms of of @xmath5 , the typical velocity dispersion in the center , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the reduced mass .",
    "however , this is ill - defined since @xmath5 usually varies with distance from the bmbh . ]",
    "where typically , @xmath8 pc .",
    "after the bmbh hardens , it continues to shrink by losing energy and angular momentum to stars , which are ejected from the system ( the `` slingshot effect '' , @xcite ) or to gas with which it interacts dynamically .",
    "once the separation further decreases by 23 orders of magnitude , the bmbh rapidly decays by the emission of gravitational waves ( gws ) until the two mbhs coalesce .    in mergers induced by interactions with stars ,",
    "the merger timescale depends on the rate at which new stars are supplied to bmbh - crossing orbits ( `` loss - cone '' trajectories ) .",
    "simulations show that this supply rate is typically not high enough ; the bmbh stalls before reaching a small enough separation for efficient decay by gw emission , and fails to coalesce in a hubble time , @xmath9 ( e.g. @xcite , see review by @xcite ) .",
    "this result appears to contradict the circumstantial evidence that most galactic nuclei contain only a single mbh @xcite , and furthermore , it implies few such very strong gw sources , which future gw detectors , such as the laser interferometric space antenna ( lisa ) , hope to detect .",
    "several mechanisms were suggested as means of accelerating bmbh coalescence ( see @xcite for a recent overview and discussion ) , either involving interactions with stars ( `` dry mergers '' ) or with gas ( `` wet mergers '' ) .",
    "these include re - ejection of stars that had a previous interaction with the bmbh but were not ejected out of the galactic core @xcite ; bmbhs embedded in dense gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; interactions of the bmbh with a third mbh @xcite ; accelerated bmbh coalescence due to accelerated loss - cone replenishment in non - axisymmetric potential @xcite or in a steep cusp @xcite .",
    "it is still unclear whether these mechanisms are efficient enough , or whether they occur commonly enough to solve the stalling problem .",
    "efficient direct interaction of with gas requires the bmbh to be embedded in a very dense massive central gas concentration .",
    "however , it is unknown whether such amounts of gas exist there .",
    "for example , the central @xmath10 pc of the galactic center ( gc ) are gas - depleted @xcite , and other galaxies also show central gas cavities in their nuclei @xcite .",
    "the gas may also be dispersed by the accreting bmbh before the merger is completed @xcite , and may not be efficient for minor mergers ( @xcite ; but see @xcite ) .",
    "it is likewise unknown whether the non - axisymmetric potential assumed by the dry merger scenario of @xcite is generally present in the post - merger galaxy on the relevant scales .",
    "even if that is the case , actual demonstration of rapid bmbh coalescence still awaits future @xmath11-body simulations with realistically high @xmath11 @xcite .    here",
    "we explore another possibility , which is likely to apply in most mergers : bmbh coalescence driven by massive perturbers ( mps ) , such as giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) or stellar clusters , in the post - merger galaxy .",
    "mps accelerate relaxation and scatter stars into the bmbh orbit at high rates .",
    "efficient relaxation by mps was first suggested by @xcite to explain stellar velocities in the galactic disk .",
    "mps remain an important component in modern models of galactic disk heating ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . a similar mechanism was proposed to explain the spatial diffusion of stars in the inner galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "in addition to dynamical heating , efficient relaxation by mps was suggested as a mechanism for loss cone replenishment and relaxation , both in the context of scattering of oort cloud comets to the sun @xcite and the scattering of stars to a mbh in a galactic nucleus @xcite .",
    "@xcite also noted the possibility of increased tidal disruption flares and accelerated mbh binary coalescence due to mps .",
    "recently , @xcite ( paper i ) studied in detail mp - driven interactions of single and binary stars with a single mbh .",
    "in this study we apply the methods developed in paper i to investigate mp - driven interactions of stars with a bmbh , and the consequences for bmbh coalescence .",
    "we explore different mp populations and merger scenarios based on the available observations and simulations , and estimate the bmbh coalescence rate .",
    "we also discuss additional implications : the mass deficit in the galactic cores and the suppression of triple mbh formation in galactic mergers .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin with a general overview of our calculations and the new results (  [ s : overview ] ) . in  [ s : mplosscone ] we briefly summarize the physics of mp - driven loss - cone replenishment , which are derived in detail in paper i. the observations and theoretical predictions of mps in the inner hundreds pc of galactic nuclei are reviewed in ",
    "[ s : mp_gc ] and used to construct the mp models used in our calculations (  [ s : models ] ) . in  [ s : merger_dyn ] we briefly review the dynamics of bmbh mergers ; a detailed technical discussion is presented in appendices [ a : stall ] and [ a : energy ] .",
    "we then present our procedure for modeling the dynamical evolution of the bmbh coalescence under various assumptions in  [ s : merger_dyn ] and analyze the results of our calculations in  [ s : results ] .",
    "we explore their implications in  [ s : implications ] and discuss and summarize our results in ",
    "[ s : summary ] .",
    "this paper presents a first detailed study of the impact of mps on bmbh mergers . in this section",
    "we give an overview of the methods , calculations and modeling that we use to study the dynamics of bmbh mergers by mp - induced slingshot events , and to estimate the merger timescale and the associated mass ejection from the nucleus .",
    "these are described in detail in  [ s : mplosscone][s : merger_dyn ] and in the appendices .",
    "we then briefly list the new results derived here , and their implications .",
    "these are described and discussed in detail in  [ s : results][s : implications ] .",
    "mps shorten the bmbh merger timescale by accelerating the supply rate of stars to the loss - cone ( see  [ s : mplosscone ] ) .",
    "the application of loss - cone theory to the bmbh merger problem requires a model of the mp properties : their mass , size , number and spatial distributions .",
    "we review the available observations and numerical simulations of mps in merging galaxies of different morphological types (  [ s : mp_gc ] , tables [ t : mps_prop ] and [ t : mps_abun ] ) .",
    "we then construct a few generic models for various types of merger scenarios , with and without mps , based on these data and on theoretical results (  [ s : models ] , table [ t : models ] ) .    to evolve the bmbh in time in the context of a given merger scenario ( defined by a bmbh mass ratio and a mp model ,",
    "[ s : merger_dyn ] ) , we execute the following steps . ( 1 ) we establish the bmbh s initial semi - major axis at the stalling point , where 2-body stellar relaxation can no longer efficiently resupply the loss - cone . the stalling radius is estimated semi - analytically by the formula derived in appendix [ a : stall ] , which are based on the @xmath11-body simulations of @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) at each time step , we calculate the rate at which stars are scattered into the loss - cone by mps from all radii taking into account the bmbh s instantaneous separation ( paper i ;  [ s : mplosscone ] ) . ( 3 ) we calculate the hardness of the encounter ( the ratio between the encounter velocity and the bmbh orbital velocity ) due to the acceleration of the infalling star in the galactic potential , as derived in appendix [ aa : galpot ] . this effect , which was neglected in previous studies , significantly decreases the energy extraction efficiency of the encounter .",
    "( 4 ) we estimate the average amount of bmbh orbital energy extracted by the interaction with the stars scattered into the loss - cone .",
    "this is based on numerical experiments of isolated 3-body encounters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter q96 ) , which are adapted in appendix [ aa : ch ] to take into account the changing hardness of the encounter in the course of the bmbh evolution .",
    "( 5 ) we include the energy extraction by gw emission , which increasingly dominates the last stages of the merger . ( 6 ) we update the bmbh semi - major axis according to the extracted energy by both the slingshot effect and gw emission . ( 7 ) we end the dynamical calculation when the emitted gw power exceeds that extracted by dynamical interactions , and the bmbh enters the final rapid gw - induced decay phase leading to coalescence .    our new results and their implications are as follows . ( 1 ) the inferred properties and numbers of mps in post - merger galactic nuclei are high enough to effectively reduce the relaxation times there by orders of magnitude . consequently",
    ", bmbh decay due to mp - induced dynamical interactions with stars is efficient enough in most mergers to lead to coalescence within a hubble time ( typically within @xmath12 yrs ) , thereby solving the `` last parsec '' problem .",
    "the rates of gw emission from bmbh coalescence should thus trace the galactic merger rates .",
    "( 2 ) since the mp - induced dynamical phase of bmbh mergers is rapid , we predict that most bmbhs will be observed either electromagnetically at separations larger than the hardening radius ( @xmath13 ) , or by gw emission at much smaller separations ( typically @xmath14 pc ) , during the gw - dominated decay phase .",
    "( 3 ) in most cases the bmbh coalescence takes less than the typical time between major galactic mergers .",
    "therefore the formation of triple mbhs through multiple galactic mergers is unlikely , and ejection of mbhs from unstable triples should be rare .",
    "( 4 ) the ejection of stars by the slingshot effect removes mass from the galactic core ( `` mass deficit '' ) .",
    "the more the bmbh can decay , the larger the total ejected mass .",
    "the spatial scale of the deficit reflects the origin of the scattered stars .",
    "we point out that the magnitude and spatial extent of the deficit can be used to discriminate between merger mechanisms .",
    "specifically , the mp - induced bmbh merger mechanism predicts a larger mass deficit over a larger spatial extent than that due to stalled mergers by stellar relaxation alone .",
    "in paper i we present a detailed quantitative analysis of the mp - induced resupply of stars to nearly radial , `` loss - cone '' orbits , which bring them within some threshold distance @xmath15 from the central mass ( mbh or bmbh ) , where they undergo a strong interaction with it ( `` event '' ) and are thereby removed ( scattered or destroyed ) .",
    "we show that the resupply rate by mps is orders of magnitude faster than that by stellar 2-body relaxation alone .",
    "this translates to an accelerated rate of close interactions with the central object . here",
    "we present a brief qualitative summary of the results of paper i and their implications .    a star with orbital energy in the range @xmath16 on a nearly - radial loss - cone orbit with angular momentum @xmath17 will reach the mbh and be removed in about a single dynamical ( or orbital ) time @xmath18 . when the resupply rate of such stars is slower than the rate at which they are removed ( @xmath19 ) , the phase - space region @xmath20 is nearly empty of stars .",
    "conversely , when the resupply rate is higher than @xmath21 , that phase - space region is nearly full , and its phase - space distribution is nearly isotropic . at that point",
    "the rate at which stars with energy @xmath22 interact with the central mass reaches its maximal value ; further scattering can not increase the rate .",
    "when the resupply of stars is driven by stellar 2-body relaxation , tightly bound regions of phase space ( high @xmath22 , small typical @xmath23 ) are empty , since the angular size of the loss - cone is large , the period is short and removal is fast .",
    "conversely , loosely bound regions ( low @xmath22 , large typical @xmath23 ) are full .",
    "most of the contribution to the total resupply rate comes from stars with energies near the transition between the empty and full loss - cone regimes , where @xmath24 , the relaxation time @xcite .",
    "this simple picture changes when mps dominate relaxation , because their distribution does not necessarily follows that of the stars , and their properties ( mass , size ) may change with distance from the center .",
    "mps of mass @xmath25 and space density @xmath26 dominate dynamical relaxation over scattering by stars of mass @xmath27 and space density @xmath28 , when the ratio of the 2nd moments of the mass distributions satisfies @xmath29 .",
    "the quantity @xmath30 thus expresses the mp enhancement factor of the relaxation timescale , up to the ratio of the coulomb logarithms for star - star and star - mp scatterings , which takes into account the extended size of the mps .",
    "this can be shown by considering first close encounters at the `` capture radius '' @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the typical relative velocity .",
    "the `` @xmath33 '' rate of such encounters with a test star is then @xmath34 .",
    "integration over all encounter distances further decreases the relaxation time by a coulomb logarithm factor that depends on the size of the system and , if @xmath35 , also on @xmath36 , the size of the mp pc where the velocity dispersion is @xmath37 and for mps of typical size @xmath38 pc , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . ] .",
    "the impact of fast , mp - induced relaxation on the rate at which stars enter the loss - cone can be incorporated into standard loss - cone theory ( e.g. @xcite ) by replacing the relaxation time due to scattering by stars with that due to mps , with the only modification being the separate treatment of rare scattering events .",
    "the effect of mps on the bmbh loss - cone depends on the typical distance from the center and on the bmbh s stage of dynamical evolution .",
    "far from the bmbh , mps fill the loss - cone and drive the resupply rate to its maximal value , while closer to the bmbh , even mps can not fill the loss - cone , but they still increase the supply rate by a large factor @xmath42 .",
    "closer still , the tidal field of the bmbh gradually limits the size and mass of the mps to the point where stellar relaxation re - emerges as the dominant relaxation mechanism ( see fig . 3 in paper i ) .",
    "the demarcation between the full and empty loss - cone regions changes with time as the bmbh decays , the size of the loss - cone decreases and the empty loss - cone region contracts .",
    "irrespective of these details , the overall effect of mps is to dramatically increase the loss - cone resupply rate over what would be expected from slow stellar 2-body relaxation alone .",
    "we calculate the loss - cone resupply rate with some simplifying approximations .",
    "we assume a spherically symmetric distribution , the _ ansatz _ @xmath43 and the keplerian expression for the orbital period @xmath18 .",
    "we also make the conservative assumption that one class of massive perturbers dominates relaxation , and neglect the contributions from other mass components ( e.g. stars ) .",
    "the full expressions for the supply rates of stars deflected from a typical radius @xmath23 in the empty loss and full loss cone regimes (  2 in paper i , ) can be respectively approximated by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the number of stars enclosed within @xmath23 , and where the dependence on the mps properties enters through the relaxation time , @xmath46 .",
    "the total loss - cone refilling rate is then given by integrating over the contributions from all radii , taking into account the fact that the refilling rate does not exceed the full - loss cone rate,@xmath47 in the context of bmbh decay , the rate ( eq . [ e : gammatot ] ) implicitly depends on time through the evolution of @xmath48 , and the rate , in turn , affects the evolution of @xmath49 through the bmbh evolution equation ( eq . [ e : adot_dyn ] below ) .",
    "the bmbh is evolved in time by iterative numerical integration of the coupled rate and evolution equations .",
    "the effects of mps are significant in situations where perturbations by stars alone are not efficient enough to refill the loss - cone on the orbital timescale .",
    "mps are most effective for large-@xmath15 processes , such as close interactions between binaries and a single mbh ( where @xmath15 is the tidal disruption radius of the binary ) , or interactions of single stars with a bmbh ( where @xmath15 is the bmbh s semi - major axis ) .",
    "this is because the larger @xmath15 , the lower the empty loss - cone refilling rate relative to that needed to completely fill the loss - cone ( i.e. @xmath50 is a decreasing function of @xmath15 for @xmath51 , eq .",
    "[ e : gammaef ] ) .",
    "the space density of mps is much smaller than that of stars , so to dominate relaxation ( @xmath52 ) they must be significantly more massive . here",
    "we consider only mps with masses @xmath53 , such as stellar clusters and gmcs gas clumps .",
    "intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) could be very effective mps , but these are not considered here since it is still unclear whether they actually exist .",
    "a summary of the observed properties of mps and those derived from simulations is presented in tables [ t : mps_prop ] and [ t : mps_abun ] .",
    "the lifespan of single mps is affected by many factors , such as collisions with other mps ; the central galactic tidal field , which can disrupt them if they approach the center on an eccentric orbit or sink there by dynamical friction ; gmcs can also be dispersed by strong radiation from stars and by supernovae . thus , individual mps are not expected to survive much longer than a few local dynamical times , a time substantially shorter than the galactic merger timescale ( roughly the galactic dynamical time ) , which in turn may be much shorter than the time required for bmbh merger .",
    "however , mps do not have to exist individually much longer than a local dynamical time to have a strong effect on relaxation .",
    "it is sufficient that the overall mp population maintains a steady state , by the continuous formation or supply of new mps to replace those destroyed .",
    "there is both observational and theoretical support for the long - term persistence of large populations of mps in galactic nuclei .",
    "observation of the gc indicate the steady state existence of a large population of short - lived mps over a hubble time .",
    "as reviewed in detail in paper i , observations of dense gas in the central @xmath54 pc of the gc reveal @xmath55 gmcs with a typical mass of @xmath56 ( table [ t : mps_prop ] ) @xcite .",
    "gmcs and young stellar clusters are stages in the path of star formation , and so the star formation rate can be used to estimate the mp mass supply rate .",
    "@xcite show that the star formation history in the central projected 30 pc of the gc is well described by continuous star formation over 10 gyr at a rate of @xmath57 .",
    "extrapolated out to 100 pc in the @xmath58 stellar distribution of the inner bulge , this corresponds to @xmath59 . since the mean star formation efficiency ( fraction of mass turned into stars ) is on average very low , @xmath60 @xcite , the star formation rate translates to an mp mass supply rate of @xmath61 , and mps formation or supply rate of @xmath62 the mean lifetime of such gmcs is then @xmath63 which is comparable to the dynamical time scale at @xmath54 pc .",
    "we therefore conclude that the observed mps in the gc , together with the inferred star formation rate and history , are fully consistent with such a steady state mp population persisting over a hubble time .",
    "simulations of gas in galactic nuclei also show highly inhomogeneous quasi - steady state conditions , with a very broad mass spectrum extending over @xmath64 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the nuclear mp population in the galaxy is probably representative of that in nuclei of other spiral galaxies , where similar amounts of dense gas are observed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , estimates of the gas supply timescales for star bursts in other galaxies also suggest continuous gas supply over @xmath65 yr @xcite .",
    "the mp contents in the nuclei of post - merger galaxies are expected to be yet larger than in the galaxy , which does not appear to have undergone a recent major merger .",
    "this is indeed observed in ulirgs @xcite , in merging galaxies @xcite , and also seen in simulations @xcite .",
    "we now turn to a detailed discussion of the observed and inferred properties of mps in galactic nuclei of different types .",
    "these form the basis of the mp models used in our numerical analysis of bmbh mergers .",
    "the @xmath54 gmcs observed in the gc , with masses in the range @xmath66@xmath67 , contain @xmath68 of the total dynamical mass on the @xmath69 pc scale and a @xmath70 in the central @xmath54 pc ( see paper i for an extended discussion of the properties of mps in our gc ) .",
    "in contrast , the central ~2 pc of the gc contain negligible amounts of gas .",
    "single molecular clouds can not be resolved in the nuclei of other spiral galaxies , but the total fraction of gas and its distribution are usually quite similar to those observed in the gc ( e.g. @xcite ; see review by @xcite ) .",
    "co observations show that the gas contains very dense large clumps that account for up to @xmath71 of the total gas contents in these regions @xcite .",
    "in addition to gmcs , many globular clusters @xcite and open clusters may inspiral into , or form in the galactic nucleus in the course of their evolution ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the galaxy contains hundreds of @xmath72 open clusters and @xmath73 globular clusters @xcite .",
    "many more are observed in other galaxies @xcite .",
    "if some of these clusters contain imbhs , they will contribute to the mps population even after the disruption of the host cluster is disrupted @xcite , and will sink all the way to the center .",
    "the gas fraction in elliptical galaxies is typically @xmath74 times smaller than in spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , in some elliptical galaxies it is comparable or even larger than that in spirals .",
    "such gas - rich ellipticals are thought to have been formed recently in a merger of two late type galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) . in particular , ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , see review by @xcite ) have extreme amounts of gas , @xmath74 times more than in the galaxy , and can have as much or more mass in gas compared to the mass in stars .",
    "elliptical galaxies may well be evolved merger products , where most of the dense gas in the core formed stars ( e.g. @xcite ) . in that case",
    ", it is plausible that the main type of mps would be the stellar clusters that were born of the gmcs , rather than the gmcs themselves .",
    "observations of stellar rings and disks in the cores of elliptical galaxies indeed suggest that present - day stellar structures reflect earlier gaseous structures @xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that ellipticals have larger numbers of globular clusters than spirals , and that mergers are associated with the formation of massive clusters @xcite .",
    "simulations of mergers of gas rich spirals indicate that @xmath75 of the total gas mass in both galaxies is driven into the central @xmath69 pc of the newly formed galaxy @xcite , where it probably forms massive clumps . in mergers of two gas - poor ellipticals ,",
    "stellar clusters may play a similar role .",
    "many of the newly formed stellar clusters will probably survive in the merged nucleus @xcite .",

    "the evolution of bmbhs with mp relaxation exhibits a short initial stalled phase , where the initially large loss - cone is empty even in the presence of mps , followed by a phase of rapid decay .",
    "it should be noted that the decay phase does not display the @xmath92 evolution of a hard bmbh , expected when @xmath93 .",
    "the acceleration of the infalling stars in the galactic potential softens the encounter with the bmbh and substantially reduces the energy extraction efficiency .",
    "figure ( [ f : ceff ] ) shows this efficiency strongly depends on both the distance from which stars are deflected to the bmbh and the bmbh separation .",
    "it should be emphasized that acceleration by the galactic potential can not not be neglected , since it substantially reduces the efficiency of any bmbh slingshot mechanism , in particular those where the potential gradient is steep ( e.g. @xcite ) or those where stars are deflected to the mbh from very large distances ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "when the bmbh merger is driven all the way to @xmath117 , the mass deficit will grow substantially ( this was recently also noted by @xcite ) . when the merger is driven by mps , the mass deficit will be on the @xmath118@xmath119 scale , where most of the scattered stars originate .",
    "we calculated the total mass of stars that originated from such distances and that were ejected from the core during coalescence .",
    "we found that these amount to approximately 30 - 40% of the total stellar mass in these regions .",
    "we note that generally , the magnitude and spatial scale of the mass deficit could , in principle , discriminate between different proposed solutions for the stalling problem . in mergers driven by non - axisymmetric potentials ,",
    "most stars originate from large radii @xcite where the enclosed number of stars is very large .",
    "the fractional , spatially - averaged mass deficit will therefore be very small , and harder to detect .",
    "in contrast , scenarios that assume very steep cusps @xcite lead to substantial central mass depletion . even in gas induced mergers @xcite , where stars play a minor role , there may be an indirect mass deficit effect caused by the inhibition of star formation due to heating of the gas by the inspiraling bmbh .",
    "we have shown that it is very likely that mps play a dominant role in the aftermath of galactic mergers .",
    "they shorten the relaxation timescale in the galactic nuclei by orders of magnitudes relative to 2-body stellar relaxation alone , and drive the newly formed bmbh to rapid coalescence by the slingshot effect .",
    "the mp mechanism requires only the existence of large enough inhomogeneities in the galactic mass distribution . since these occur naturally over a wide range of conditions , the mp mechanism is robust and probably accelerates most bmbhs mergers",
    ". the one possible exception may be mergers of two gas - poor elliptical galaxies , where gmcs are less common .",
    "however , simulations indicate that stellar clusters can play the role of mps and drive an efficient merger even in most of these cases .",
    "we conclude that most bmbhs are expected to coalesce within @xmath9 , even in cases where previous theoretical modeling , which did not consider accelerated relaxation by mps , predicts that the merging bmbh stalls .",
    "this conclusion is based on conservative assumptions .",
    "we considered only circular bmbhs , whereas eccentric bmbhs coalesce even faster in the gw emission dominated phase , and we neglected the possible concurrent effects of any of the other orbital decay mechanisms proposed in the literature .",
    "it thus appears likely the bmbh coalescence is in fact achieved on timescales @xmath120 which implies that bmbh coalescence gw events occur at the cosmic rate of galactic mergers .",
    "specifically , we predict that low - mass bmbhs , which are prospective lisa targets , should coalesce within a merger dynamical time , @xmath89@xmath121 yr .",
    "efficient mp - driven bmbh coalescence have additional implications , which were discussed here briefly . fast bmbh mergers decrease the probability of nuclei containing triple mbhs , and hence of ejected mbhs , since in most cases , the bmbh coalescence time is shorter than the mean time between galactic collisions . during the final stage of the merger ,",
    "when the bmbh separation shrinks from the hardening radius to the final gw radius , a large number of stars will be ejected from the nuclei .",
    "we find that this additional ejection stage could appreciably increase the mass deficit of the newly formed nucleus , beyond what is predicted taking into account only the earlier stages of the merger @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the plausible existence of mps in galactic nuclei shortens the relaxation time by orders of magnitude .",
    "in particular , mps accelerate the dynamical decay of bmbhs by efficiently supplying stars for the slingshot mechanism .",
    "this prevents stalling ( the `` last parsec problem '' ) and allows the final coalescence of the bmbh by gw emission within a hubble time .",
    "this appendix presents a simple analytic approximation for the stalling separation , @xmath122 , as function of the pre - merger galactic density profile and the bmbh mass ratio @xmath109 , which is based on the @xmath11-body simulations of @xcite .",
