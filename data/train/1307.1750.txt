    "study of the nature of light scalar resonances is one of the central problems of nonperturbative qcd , it is important for understanding the chiral symmetry realization way in the low energy region and , consequently , the confinement physics",
    ". the @xmath2 and @xmath3 tensor mesons are well - known p - wave @xmath13 states .",
    "naively one might think that the scalar @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons are also the @xmath13 p - wave states with the same quark structure , as @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "but now there are many indications that the above scalars are the four quark states",
    ".    comparative study of the production of scalar and tensor mesons is proposed to investigate the nature of light scalar mesons . for this purpose",
    "the intensity of scalar @xmath0 , @xmath1 and tensor @xmath2 , @xmath3 mesons production at the colliders vepp-2000 ( binp , novosibirsk ) and da@xmath4ne ( lnf , frascati ) in the processes @xmath14 ( here and hereafter @xmath15 , @xmath16 ; @xmath17 , @xmath12 ) is calculated .",
    "as it is known , the kaon loop model @xcite describe the @xmath20 decays well @xcite .",
    "the signal contribution is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 are vector mesons .",
    "the signal cross - sections    @xmath23 @xmath24    @xmath25 @xmath26    @xmath27    the @xmath28 is the amplitude of the @xmath29 transition . without mixing of the intermediate vector states this amplitude is    @xmath30    we took into account mixing of the resonances according to ref .",
    "the @xmath31 is the @xmath32 or @xmath33 invariant mass correspondingly , @xmath34 for the pions identity and @xmath35 is the integral on the kaon loop @xcite .",
    "the @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the inverse propagators of scalar mesons , they are taken from @xcite and @xcite ( 2012 paper ) correspondingly .",
    "all parameters of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are taken from @xcite ( fit 1 ) and @xcite ( fit 1 of the 2012 paper ) correspondingly .",

    "because of weakness of the signal cross - sections in the region @xmath42 gev it is needed to treat the background situation accurately .",
    "the @xmath43 and @xmath44 are expected to be too small to be observed themselves , but for @xmath45 and @xmath46 it is possible to reduce background to the level much less than the signal one .",
    "the background situation in case of @xmath47 and @xmath48 is rather friendly . the main background @xmath49 , obtained with the help of ref .",

    "other backgrounds are even much smaller .",
    "the main background in case of @xmath50 and @xmath51 reactions comes from the @xmath52 intermediate state also .",
    "[ figspec]a shows that cut @xmath53 mev from the @xmath54 mass in the @xmath55 distribution reduces this background to the small level .",
    "our analysis shows that it should be possible to observe the reactions @xmath56 and @xmath57 at the energies near @xmath58 gev in vepp-2000 after reaching the project luminosity and probably in @xmath59 after the planned full upgrade .    as to the reactions @xmath60 and @xmath61 at the energies @xmath62 gev , in the kaon loop model their cross sections are very small , while if the mere vdm ( point - like @xmath63 interaction ) was correct they would be observed , see fig .",
    "consequently , observation of tenzor contribution and non - observation of the scalar one would support the four quark nature of light scalar mesons @xcite .",
