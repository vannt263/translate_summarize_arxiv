    "the crab pulsar ( psr b0531 + 21 ) was the first isolated neutron star ( ins ) identified at optical wavelengths ( cocke , disney , & taylor 1968 ) .",
    "almost a decade went by till another ins , the vela pulsar ( psr b0833 - 45 ) , was detected ( lasker 1976 ) and confirmed ( wallace et al . 1977 ) .",
    "the vela pulsar , among the faintest objects known at that time ( @xmath0 ) , was also the last ins detected by photograhic plates .",
    "a decade later , came the first ccd detection of the optical counterpart of another ins , geminga ( bignami et al .",
    "spurred by this result and by the advent of the new generation telescopes ( e.g. the eso ntt ) , optical observations of inss were carried on with revived enthusiasm and at the beginning of the 90s yielded to the detections of the counterparts of psr b0540 - 69 ( caraveo et al .",
    "1992 ) , readily confirmed by shearer et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , psr b0656 + 14 ( caraveo , bignami , & mereghetti 1994a ) psr b1509 - 58 ( caraveo , mereghetti , & bignami 1994b ) , this one later revised by wagner & seifert ( 2000 ) . in the meantime , the identification of geminga was confirmed through the proper motion measurement of its counterpart ( bignami , caraveo , & mereghetti 1993 ) .",
    "the launch of   in 1990 increased the chances of detecting new inss by providing access to the near - uv window through the short - wavelength sensitivity of the faint object camera ( foc ) .",
    "indeed , soon came the detections of psr b0950 + 08 , psr b1929 + 10 ( pavlov , stringfellow , & cordva 1996 ) and psr b1055 - 52 ( mignani , caraveo , & bignami 1997 ) .",
    "likely optical counterparts were also detected for some of the inss singled out in the rosat data ( a.k.a .",
    "x - ray dim inss - xdinss ) , namely rxj 1856 - 3754 ( walter & matthews 1997 ) and rxj 0720 - 3125 ( kulkarni & van kerkwijk 1998 ) .",
    "thus , the number of inss observed in the optical / uv increased by a factor four in just a decade .",
    "in recent years , much effort was concentrated on confirming most of the proposed counterparts . of course , pursuing the identification by searching for optical pulsations at the radio / x - ray period , although ideally the best way , turned out to be extremely difficult due to the intrinsic object faintness . furthermore , almost none of the middle - size / large ground - based telescopes offered devices for high - resolution timing and very few of them were easily adaptable to suited guest instruments .",
    "such problems prompted observes to devise alternative identification strategies .",
    "the use of proper motion measurements of the candidate counterpart , successfully experimented in the case of geminga ( bignami et al . 1993 ) , proved to be a powerful tool . indeed , proper motion yielded the confirmation of the optical counterparts of psr b0656 + 14 ( mignani , de luca & caraveo 2000 ) , although a marginal detection of optical pulsations did exhist ( shearer et al .",
    "1998 ) , of rxj 1856 - 3754 ( walter 2001 ) , of psr b1929 + 10 ( mignani et al . 2002 ) and of rxj 0720 - 3125 ( motch , zavlin , & haberl 2003 ) , all but the last one achieved through high - resolution   imaging . in the meantime , the space telescope imaging spectrometer ( stis ) on , equipped with a uv - sensitive mama device , took up the pathfinder task of the dismissed foc .",
    "in addition , with a timing resolution of 125 @xmath1s , the stis made it possible to perform timing observations of pulsars in this spectral region .",
    "apart from the crab pulsar ( gull et al . , these proceedings ) , four other pulsars have been observed to date by the stis . while the timing of psr b1929 + 10 has not provided so far conclusive results ( mignani , p.c . ) , pulsations at the known period have been clearly detected from the vela pulsar and geminga ( romani & pavlov 2003 ) as well as from psr b0656 + 14 ( gull et al . , these proceedings ) . while for the vela pulsar the stis data have provided the first measure of its light curve in the uv , for psr b0656 + 14 and geminga detected pulsations provided further confirmation of the identifications , improving on the earlier timing results of shearer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and shearer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . by exploiting the high positional accuracy provided by , likely candidate optical counterparts have been also detected by the stis for two newly discovered xdinss , rxj 1308.6 + 2127 and rxj 1605.3 + 3249 ( kaplan , kulkani , & van kerkwijk 2002,2003 ) .",
    "the last entry is psr j0437 - 4715 , the first ms - pulsar detected at optical / uv wavelengths , recently detected with the stis ( kargaltzev , pavlov , & romani 2003 ) .",
    "table 1 summarizes the current ( october 2003 ) optical / uv identification status of inss .",
    "as it is seen , owing to their intrinsic faintness , most inss have been detected only thanks to their proximity and small interstellar absorption .",
    "only the crab pulsar , psr b1509 - 58 and psr b0540 - 69 have been detected at more than 1 kpc distance .",
    "looking at table 1 we see that thanks to the new telescopes / ccd technologies , the ins discovery rate increased from _",
    "one per decade _ to almost _ one per year_. in particular , we note how the   contribution has been fundamental , providing nearly all of the ins detections obtained in the last 10 years i.e. half of the total . as a matter of fact , so far   has clearly detected all the inss it was targetted to .",
    "instead , the   potentialities have been only partially exploited in the identification work , yielding so far only to one detection . finally",

    "( 2002 )    although the spectral database is far from being complete , some general patterns can be recognized in table 2 .",
    "first of all , the spectrum grows in complexity as a function of the inss age , passing from a single power - law ( pl ) to a composite one featuring both pl and blackbody ( bb ) components .",
    "the underlying presence of a pl component is also recognizable from the correlation between the optical luminosity @xmath20 and the rotational energy loss @xmath21 ( see kramer , these proceedings ) .",
    "although in some cases the optical pl / bb components do match the extrapolation of the analogous components observed in the x - ray domain , no general optical / x - ray correlation can be recognized .",
    "thus , optical and x - ray emission mechanisms are not always related to each other .",
    "the optical emission properties of inss can be summarized as follows for the different age class indentified in table 2 : + ( i ) : they are characterized by single pl spectra , all with spectral index @xmath22 apart from the crab which shows evidence for a spectral turnover in the optical / ir ( sollerman et al .",
    "+ ( ii ) : they feature composite spectra with both pl and bb components , the former dominating in the ir , the latter in the uv . in general",
    "they have spectral indexes @xmath23 which , at least for psr b0656 + 14 , seem to be steeper than in young inss . for both psr b0656 + 14 and geminga ,",
    "the optical bb is consistent with the extrapolation of the x - ray one and is likely produced from the whole neutron star surface . for psr b1055 - 52",
    "nothing can be said but that the u - band flux is consistent with the extrapolation of the x - ray pl .",
    "+ ( iii ) : both psr b1929 + 10 and psr b0950 + 08 feature single pl spectra with spectral indexes @xmath23 and steeper than those of middle - aged inss . an additional bb component might be present but it can not constrained by the present data .",
    "+ ( iv ) : the uv spectrum of psr j0437 - 4715 is a bb , with a temperature higher than the one of the @xmath24 times younger psr j0108 - 1431 . for psr j2124 - 3358 and psr j0030 + 04651 ( see  3 ) , the available flux",
    "upper limits seem also to suggest a bb spectrum .",
    "+ ( v ) : for rxj 1857 - 3754 the spectrum is a bb and it is above the optical extrapolation of the x - ray one . on the other hand",
    ", the spectrum of rxj 0720 - 3125 seems to be composite , with a dominant bb component ( also above the optical extrapolation of the x - ray one ) and a pl with @xmath25 .",
    "although a few pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) have been detected in x - rays by   ( gaensler et al .",
    ", these proceedings ) , optical observations are still limited to a few cases .",
    "apart from the crab ( e.g. , hester et al . 2002 ) ,   has observed only three other young pulsars with pwne . + the structure of the psr b0540 - 69 pwn has been resolved by the /hrc ( gotthelf & wang 2000 ) in three different components : a point - like source coincident with the pulsar , an elongated toroidal structure around it and a jet - like feature apparently protruding from the pulsar . in the optical , a pwne",
    "is clearly detected in the   data of caraveo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) with a very similar elongated pattern and a shallow maximum southwest of the pulsar .",
    "also the faint jet , marginally visible in the   image , does have an optical counterpart .",
    "+ the vela pwn features a brighter inner part ( @xmath26 ) , with two arcs , a jet , and a counter - jet , symmetrical around the pulsar s proper motion direction .",
    "the inner pwn is then embedded into an extended emission ( outer pwn ) , surrounded by a bean - shaped diffuse nebula ( @xmath27 ) with an elongated region of fainter emission and a @xmath28-long outer jet southwest and northwest of it , respectively ( see also kalgartzev et al . these proceedings ) . to investigate the reality of the previously claimed optical pwn ( gelman et al .",
    "1989 ) , mignani et al . ( 2003c ) have compared   and very deep   images of the field but no optical counterparts of the known x - ray features could be identified with 3@xmath29 ( extinction corrected ) upper limits of @xmath30 mag arcsec@xmath31 and @xmath3227.8 mag arcsec@xmath31 on the brightness of the inner and outer pwn , respectively . by using wider eso _ ntt _ and 2.2 m images , mignani et al .",
    "( 2003c ) also set upper limits of * @xmath33 * mag arcsec@xmath31 on the optical emission from the southwest extension of the x - ray nebula . while the derived upper limits for the inner / outer pwn are not far from the extrapolation of the available x - ray / radio data , the ones for the southwest extension are at least 3 orders of magnitudes above the expected value .",
    "for the psr j0537 - 6910 pwn no conclusive results have been obtained so far .",
    "a preliminar search for an optical pwn was performed by wang et al .",
    "( 2001 ) using archived   observations but they were too shallow to set stringent constraints .",
    "their results can now be improved thanks to recent , much deeper , /acs observations of the field ( mignani et al .",
    "inss with either a secured or a likely optical counterpart amounts now to 14 , i.e. , a number comparable to those detected in x - rays in the pre - rosat era .",
    "thus , the optical branch , originally confined to a handful of representative cases , is growing in importance occupying a larger and larger niche in the multiwavelength studies of inss .",
    "certainly , much work remains to be done to reduce the gap , both in terms of quality and quantity , with the x - ray domain .",
    "more deep imaging observations are needed to pinpoint new candidates , to study correlations between the emission properties ( luminosities , spectra ) as a function of the pulsars parameters and to search for diffuse emission structures ( pwne and bow - shocks ) .",
    "more timing observations are required , both to secure faster identifications and to provide a broader characterization of the pulsars lightcurves .",
    "finally , more spectroscopy is critical to better define the emission processes .",
    "these are tasks both for the current 10 m class telescopes and for the next generation of extra - large telescopes ( becker & mignani , these proceedings ) .",
