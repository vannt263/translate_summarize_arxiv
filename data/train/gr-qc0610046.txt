    "astronomical observations indicate that many galaxies host a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) in their centre , which is surrounded by a cluster of stars .",
    "stellar encounters in the cluster modify the stellar orbits over time and can put objects onto trajectories that pass very close to the smbh .",
    "if this happens , the star loses energy and angular momentum to a burst of gravitational radiation emitted near periapse , and this may leave the object bound to the central black hole .",
    "gravitational radiation dominates the subsequent evolution , and the object gradually inspirals into the smbh . if the captured star is a compact object , i.e. , a white dwarf , neutron star or black hole ( so that it is not tidally disrupted ) and the smbh has mass @xmath1@xmath2 , the gravitational waves ( gws ) emitted during the last several years of inspiral will be at frequencies that the planned space - based gravitational wave ( gw ) observatory lisa will be able to detect .",
    "the rate at which these extreme mass ratio inspiral ( emri ) events occur in the universe is highly uncertain , but is likely to be at most only a few times per year in each gpc@xmath3 of space @xcite .",
    "lisa emri events are thus unlikely to be closer than @xmath4gpc , at which distance the typical instantaneous strain amplitude is @xmath5 .",
    "this must be compared to the characteristic noise strain in the lisa detector of @xmath6 at the floor of the noise curve near 5 mhz @xcite .",
    "emri waveforms will be detectable for several years before plunge , which makes detection possible by building up the signal - to - noise ratio over many waveform cycles using matched filtering . however , matched filtering involves searching a bank of templates that describe all possible signals that might be present in the data .",
    "an emri waveform depends on @xmath7 parameters ( although several of these are not important for determining the waveform phasing ) and lisa will detect up to @xmath8 cycles of the waveform prior to plunge . estimating that one template might be required per cycle in each parameter , and @xmath9 important parameters ,",
    "gives an estimate of @xmath10 templates required for the simplest case of a search for a single emri embedded in pure gaussian noise .",
    "this is far more than can be searched in a reasonable computational time @xcite .",
    "analysis of lisa data is further complicated by the fact that it is signal dominated , i.e. , at any moment the data stream includes not only instrumental noise but thousands of signals of different types which overlap in time and frequency .",
    "the optimal matched filter should therefore be a superposition of all the signals that are present .",
    "techniques exist to construct such a global matched filter iteratively , such as markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods , and are currently being investigated in the context of lisa @xcite , including for characterisation of lisa emris @xcite .",
    "however , the mcmc approach still relies on matched filtering .",
    "although this is done in an efficient way that typically requires only @xmath11 waveform evaluations @xcite , these @xmath12 templates need to be either generated on the fly , or looked up in a template bank .",
    "for emris , the computational cost of either approach may be prohibitively high , unless some advance estimate has been made of the parameters of the signals present in the data .",
    "to devise such parameter estimation techniques , it is reasonable to first consider the problem of detecting a single source in noisy data , before using and adapting the methods to the case of multiple sources .",
    "it is this second problem , searching for a single source while ignoring source confusion , that work on emri searches has concentrated on so far .",
    "one possible algorithm for emri detection is a semi - coherent approach  rather than search for the full waveform , begin with a coherent search for @xmath13@xmath14 week segments of emri waveforms , before following up with a second stage where the power in each segment is summed up through sequences of segments that correspond to inspirals . assuming reasonable computational resources ,",
    "this technique could detect individual emri events out to a redshift @xmath15 @xcite , which would mean as many as several hundred emri detections over the duration of the lisa mission , although this is very dependent on the intrinsic astrophysical rate of emri events . the semi - coherent method ,",
    "although computationally feasible , makes heavy use of computing resources .",
    "however , the high potential event rate suggests that it might be possible to detect the loudest several emri events using much simpler , template - free techniques , at a tiny fraction of the computational cost .",
    "a promising technique for the detection of emris , and other types of lisa sources , is a time - frequency analysis  divide the lisa data stream into shorter segments and construct a fourier spectrum of each , hence creating a time - frequency spectrogram of the data , and then search this time - frequency map for features .",
    "the simplest possible time - frequency algorithm is an excess power search , i.e. , a search for unusually bright pixels in the spectrogram . while this performs poorly when applied to the raw data ,",
    "if the data is binned first , the excess power method is able to detect typical emri events at distances of up to @xmath16gpc @xcite , or about half the distance of the semi - coherent search @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of the excess power method in isolation is that it does not provide much information about the source parameters , but merely indicates that a source is present in the data .",
    "a follow up analysis must therefore be used to extract information about events identified by the excess power search @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a somewhat more sophisticated time - frequency algorithm , the hierarchical algorithm for clusters and ridges ( hacr ) @xcite .",
    "this method involves first identifying unusually bright pixels in the time - frequency map , then constructing a cluster of bright pixels around it , before finally using the number of pixels in the cluster as a threshold to distinguish signals from noise events .",
    "the properties of the hacr clusters encode information about the source , and thus in a single analysis hacr allows both detection and parameter estimation .",
    "we have found that when hacr is applied to the unbinned spectrogram , it performs poorly , but if the spectrogram is first binned via the same technique used for the excess power search @xcite , we find that hacr outperforms the excess power search , as we would expect .",
    "hacr is able to detect typical emri events at distances of @xmath17gpc , which is a little further than the excess power technique .",
    "however , the hacr clusters associated with detection events tend to have several hundred pixels , and thus encode a significant amount of information about the source .",
    "the hacr search can be tuned to be sensitive to a specific source at a specific distance , or to a specific source at an unknown distance , or to an unknown source at an unknown distance . while the detection performance for a specific source does depend on how the hacr thresholds are tuned , we find that the variation of detection rate is not huge and so a single hacr search could be used to detect multiple types of event in a search of the lisa data .",
    "the hacr search encompasses the excess power search as a subset ( with the pixel threshold set to 1 ) , which will allow us to compare hacr s performance to the performance of the excess power algorithm in this paper .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ lisa ]",
    "we describe lisa , the lisa data stream and lisa sources , including the waveform models we use for source injections and the noise model we use to estimate lisa s noise spectral density . in section  [ hacr ]",
    "we introduce the hacr algorithm , discuss how the time - frequency map may be binned to improve detection of signals and describe how the hacr search can be characterised when no signals are present . in section  [ emriperformance ] , we describe how the hacr thresholds may be tuned for detection of a single source or multiple sources , while maintaining a constant overall false alarm probability , and we evaluate hacr s performance at detecting a range of emri signals in lisa data . although emris are the main focus of our analysis , time - frequency techniques like hacr may play a role in the detection and identification of other sources in the lisa data stream . for this reason , in section  [ otherperformance ] we evaluate hacr s performance at detecting other classes of signal , specifically the gravitational waves from white dwarf binaries and the mergers of supermassive black hole binaries . in section  [ paramest ]",
    "we will briefly describe how the properties of the event candidates identified by hacr could be used to estimate parameters of the source , although a more detailed investigation of this is reserved for a future paper .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclusion ] we summarise our results .",
    "the lisa detector will consist of three spacecraft in heliocentric earth - trailing orbits , @xmath18 million kilometres apart at the corners of an ( approximately ) equilateral triangle ( see @xcite for a full description of the mission ) .",
    "there will be two lasers running between each pair of spacecraft , one in each direction , and it is the differences in laser phase between the various light travel paths that indicate that gravitational waves are passing through the detector . in the raw data , the laser phase difference is totally dominated by laser frequency noise .",
    "however , this can be suppressed without eradicating the gw signal using time delay interferometry ( tdi , see for instance @xcite and references therein ) . at high frequencies ,",
    "there are three independent tdi channels in which the noise is uncorrelated , which are typically denoted @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . at low frequencies",
    "there are essentially only two independent data channels , since lisa can be regarded as a superposition of two static orthogonal michelson interferometers over relevant timescales .",
    "these two low frequency response functions , denoted @xmath22 and @xmath23 , are defined in @xcite . in this analysis",
    "we treat the lisa data stream as consisting of only the latter two channels , since our sources are at comparatively low frequency , and the michelson responses are quick and easy to compute . while not a totally accurate representation of lisa , this approach incorporates the modulations due to the detector motion in a reasonable way and so is sufficient for the qualitative nature of the current analysis .",
    "lisa is expected to detect gravitational waves from many sources of several different types .",
    "lisa should detect many millions of compact object binaries ( white dwarf  white dwarf , white dwarf ",
    "neutron star , neutron star  neutron star ) in our own galaxy , which generate essentially monochromatic gravitational wave signals ( up to detector modulations ) .",
    "these binary signals are sufficiently dense in frequency space that the majority will not be individually resolvable , but form a confusion foreground from which other sources must be extracted . however , several thousand binaries will still be resolvable @xcite .",
    "lisa should also detect several ( estimates suggest as many as a few tens per year , e.g. , @xcite ) signals from the final inspiral and merger of smbh binaries .",
    "for smbhs of appropriate mass , @xmath24@xmath2 , these mergers will be visible out to very high redshifts and will appear in the lisa data stream with very high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "over the course of its planned three year mission , lisa should also detect as many as several hundred emri events as discussed in the introduction , and may detect gw bursts and perhaps a stochastic gw background .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the issue of detection of emri events and to do so we must consider a typical emri signal .",
    "work on the semi - coherent search suggested that the lisa emri event rate would be dominated by the inspiral of black holes of mass @xmath25 into smbhs with mass @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "an emri will be detectable for the last several years of the inspiral , and hence could last for a significant fraction of the lisa mission duration .",
    "moreover , since the emri will typically be captured with very high eccentricity and random inclination with respect to the equatorial plane of the smbh , the inspiral orbit is likely to have some residual eccentricity and inclination at plunge .",
    "theoretical models @xcite and some observational evidence @xcite indicate that most astrophysical black holes will have significant spins .",
    "bearing all this in mind , we choose as a `` typical '' emri event ( which we shall refer to as source `` a '' ) the inspiral of a @xmath27 black hole into a @xmath28 smbh with spin @xmath29 .",
    "we assume conservatively that the lisa mission will last only three years ( @xmath30s ) and that the emri event is observed for the whole of the lisa mission , but plunges shortly after the end of the observation .",
    "this sets the initial orbital pericentre to be at @xmath31 .",
    "we take the eccentricity and orbital inclination at the start of the observation to be @xmath32 and @xmath33 and fix the sky position in ecliptic coordinates to be @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "the orientation of the smbh spin is chosen such that if the smbh was at the solar system barycentre , the spin would point towards ecliptic coordinates @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "these latter orientation angles were chosen arbitrarily , but are non - special .",
    "we generate the emri waveform using the approximate , `` kludge '' , approach described in @xcite .",
    "these kludge waveforms are much quicker to generate than accurate perturbative waveforms , but capture all the main features of true emri waveforms and show remarkable faithfulness when compared to more accurate waveforms .",
    "in addition to source `` a '' , we will consider two other emri injections .",
    "these have the same parameters as `` a '' , except for the initial orbital eccentricity , which is taken to be @xmath38 for source `` k '' and @xmath39 for source `` n '' .",
    "the waveforms and waveform labels used are the same as those examined in the context of the excess power search in @xcite , to facilitate comparison .    in section  [ otherperformance ] , we will examine the performance of hacr in detecting other lisa sources , namely white dwarf binaries and smbh mergers .",
    "for both of these sources , we take the waveform model , including detector modulations , from @xcite . although more sophisticated smbh merger models are available , the prescription in @xcite is sufficiently accurate for our purposes .",
    "the waveform model for a non - evolving white dwarf binary is very simple and has been well understood for many years and is summarised in @xcite .      to characterize the search , we need to include the effects of detector noise . to do this",
    ", we use the noise model from barack and cutler @xcite , which has been corrected in the preprint gr - qc/0310125 .",
    "we use the corrected expressions here . ] , which includes both instrumental noise and `` confusion noise '' from the unresolvable white dwarf binary foreground .",
    "the noise spectral density is given by @xmath40 in this , the parameter @xmath41 measures how well white dwarfs of similar frequency can be distinguished , and we take @xmath42 as in @xcite . in practice , rather than adding coloured noise to the injected signal , we first whiten the signal using this theoretical noise prescription and then inject it into white gaussian noise .",
    "the procedures are equivalent , under the assumption that the lisa data stream can be regarded as stationary and supposing that the noise spectral density is known or can be determined .",
    "this is likely to be a poor assumption , but a more accurate analysis is difficult and beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the hacr algorithm identifies clusters of pixels containing excess power in a time - frequency map and represents a variation of the tfclusters algorithm @xcite . in a given time - frequency map ,",
    "we denote the power in a pixel as @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the time and frequency co - ordinates of the pixel .",
    "hacr employs two power thresholds , @xmath46 and a pixel threshold , @xmath47 . at the first stage",
    ", the algorithm identifies all _ black pixels _ with @xmath48 and all _ grey pixels _ with @xmath49 . at the second stage",
    ", hacr takes each black pixel in turn and counts all the grey pixels that are connected to that black pixel through a path of touching grey pixels .",
    "touching is defined as sharing an edge or corner .",
    "this process is repeated for each black pixel .",
    "to be classified as an _ event candidate _",
    "a cluster of pixels must have @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the number of pixels contained in a particular cluster .",
    "the algorithm is illustrated in figure  [ hacrill ]     are classified as _",
    "black pixels_. surrounding pixels with @xmath49 are then classified as _ grey pixels _ building a cluster around the black pixel .",
    "the cluster is classified as an event candidate if the number of pixels it contains , @xmath51 , exceeds the threshold @xmath52,height=336 ]    there is some degeneracy between the thresholds , particularly @xmath53 and @xmath47 .",
    "choosing a low value of @xmath53 tends to make clusters larger , but this can be partially compensated for by using a larger value for the pixel threshold , @xmath47 . in our first analysis , we fixed @xmath53 and tuned only @xmath47 for this reason .",
    "however , tuning @xmath53 as well can enhance the detection rate by @xmath54 . results in this paper use tuning over both thresholds .",
    "the thresholds affect not only the detection rate , but also parameter extraction .",
    "a smaller @xmath53 tends to make clusters larger .",
    "this might increase the detection rate , but it also increases the number of noise pixels in each detected cluster , hampering parameter extraction .",
    "the optimal thresholds for the final search will ultimately come from a compromise between greater reach and more accurate parameter extraction . in a future paper ,",
    "when we explore parameter estimation , we will examine this issue more carefully . in the current paper",
    ", we look only at maximizing the detection rate .",
    "it is possible to improve the performance of the search by `` binning '' the time - frequency maps .",
    "this binning procedure was the key stage in the simple excess power search discussed in @xcite .",
    "this binning procedure involves constructing an average power map using boxes of particular size .",
    "the average power contained within a box is defined by @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 are the lengths of the box edges in the time and frequency dimensions respectively and @xmath58 is the number of data points enclosed .",
    "this average power is computed for a box aligned on _",
    "each _ pixel in the time - frequency map .",
    "adjacent pixels in the average power map are therefore not independent . in practice ,",
    "for ease of computation we choose the alignment so that the pixel is in the top left hand corner of the box . as in @xcite",
    ", we use only box sizes @xmath59 for all possible integer values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we denote the total number of different box shapes used as @xmath62 .    for a given source , the box size that will do best for",
    "detection will be large enough to include much of the signal power but small enough to avoid too much noise contribution .",
    "this optimum will be source specific due to the wide variation in emri waveforms .",
    "the inspiral of a @xmath63white dwarf occurs much more slowly than that of a @xmath64black hole , so in the first case , the optimal box size is likely to be longer in the time dimension .",
    "gws from an inspiral into a rapidly spinning black hole or from a highly eccentric inspiral orbit are characterized by many frequency harmonics , often close together . in that case",
    ", a box that is wider in the frequency dimension may perform well . in designing a search",
    ", a balance must therefore be struck between having sensitivity to a range of sources and increasing the reach of the search for a specific source .",
    "we will consider this more carefully in section  [ targsearch ] .",
    "the binned spectrograms for each box size can be generated in a particular sequence that improves the efficiency and speed of the search as shown in figure  [ binning ] .",
    "we first construct the unbinned @xmath65 map of the data and store it as map a. before analysing map a we construct the @xmath66 map by summing the powers in vertically adjacent bins and storing this as map b ( step 1 ) .",
    "we then search map a using hacr before summing the power of pixels in horizontally adjacent bins to construct the @xmath67 map , and overwrite map a ( step 2 ) . repeating this procedure on this new map a",
    ", we construct and search all the box sizes @xmath68 . before analysing the @xmath66 map stored as map b",
    "we construct the @xmath69 map and store this as map a ( step 3 ) . using and overwriting map b ,",
    "we construct and search all the box sizes @xmath70 ( step 4 ) .",
    "we repeat this procedure until we have searched all possible box sizes up to the limit imposed by the size of our time - frequency map .",
    "this efficient binning method requires the storage of only two time - frequency maps at any given time and reduces the number of floating point operations needed through careful recycling of maps .",
    "it is thus very computationally efficient .",
    "we set the hacr thresholds separately for each binned spectrogram and denote them @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 where the superscripts refer to the dimensions of the box size we are using .",
    "a hacr detection occurs if the pixel threshold is exceeded by _ at least one _ cluster in _ at least one _ binned spectrogram . to characterize the entire search ( over all box sizes ) we define an overall false alarm probability ( @xmath74 )",
    "this is defined as _",
    "the fraction of lisa missions _ in which hacr would make _ at least one false detection _ in _ at least one of the binned time - frequency maps _ , in the absence of any signals .",
    "each box size that we use to analyse the data could be allowed to contribute a different amount to @xmath74 , but to avoid prejudicing our results , we choose to assign an equal false alarm probability to each box size .",
    "we call this quantity the additional false alarm probability ( @xmath75 ) . to be clear , @xmath75 is the probability of a false alarm in a particular box size , i.e. , the fraction of lisa missions in which _ that particular box size _ would yield a false detection .",
    "the way in which the thresholds are computed ensures that each box size adds @xmath75 to the overall false alarm rate ( hence `` additional '' ) , despite the fact that the binned spectrograms are not all independent .",
    "this will be described in section  [ hacrtune ] , and ensures that in practice @xmath76 .",
    "it is important to note that in the case @xmath77 then the hacr algorithm is equivalent to the excess power method described in earlier papers @xcite .",
    "a comparison between these two algorithms will be made in subsequent sections of this paper .      for our preliminary study we considered a three year lisa mission , and used @xmath78 of simulated lisa data sampled at @xmath79 ( a cadence of @xmath80 ) . to construct the time - frequency map ,",
    "this data was divided into @xmath81 ( @xmath82 week ) sections , and an fft was performed on each section .",
    "the resulting time - frequency spectrograms consist of @xmath83 points in time and @xmath84 points in frequency giving us @xmath85 possible box sizes of the form @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "a power spectrogram was constructed for both lisa low - frequency channels , @xmath22 and @xmath23 and these were summed pixel by pixel to produce the time - frequency map searched by the hacr algorithm . in practice ,",
    "the noise in the two lisa channels was taken to be normal , gaussian and white but the injected signals were whitened using the theoretical lisa noise curve described in section  [ lisa ] . in this approach , in the absence of a signal the power , @xmath43 , in each pixel of the unbinned spectrogram will be distributed as a @xmath89 with 4 degrees of freedom .    the division into @xmath13 week segments was chosen to facilitate comparison with the excess power search @xcite , and it is a fairly reasonable choice for emris .",
    "the maximum segment length that ensures a source whose frequency is changing at @xmath90 does not move by more than one frequency bin over the segment is @xmath91 . in the extreme mass ratio limit , the leading order post - newtonian rate of change of frequency is @xmath92 for a circular orbit of radius @xmath93 ( in units with @xmath94 ) @xcite . for the inspiral of a @xmath95 object into a @xmath28",
    "this gives a maximum segment length of @xmath96 day when the orbital radius is @xmath97 .",
    "at that radius , the frequency would change by @xmath98 bins during one @xmath99 week time segment .",
    "this change is less rapid earlier in the inspiral and more rapid later in the inspiral .",
    "if we choose time segments that are too short , the spectrogram will be dominated by short timescale fluctuations in the detector noise , and the frequency bins will be broad , so we lose resolution in the time frequency map .",
    "time segments with length @xmath96 week seem like a reasonable compromise . in the future",
    ", we plan to experiment with shorter and longer time segments",
    ". however , the choice of time segment length should not significantly affect our results thanks to the binning part of the search algorithm .",
    "the computational cost of running the hacr search is very low .",
    "if we divide the lisa data stream into @xmath100 time segments , each one containing @xmath101 time samples , the number of floating point operations required to compute the unbinned spectrogram of the data is roughly @xmath102 using fast fourier transforms .",
    "the efficient binning algorithm ensures that only two floating point operations are needed to evaluate the average power for a given pixel in any one of the binned spectrograms ( as opposed to @xmath103 operations if the binned spectrogram was computed directly from the unbinned map ) .",
    "the number of operations required to construct all the binned spectrograms is therefore less than @xmath104 ( less since the average power is not defined for pixels in the last @xmath105 columns and @xmath106 rows when using the @xmath107 box size ) .",
    "the hacr algorithm first identifies pixels as black , grey or neither ( @xmath108 operations ) and then counts the number of pixels in each cluster . for a given cluster , counting the size involves @xmath109 operations per pixel ( @xmath110 comparisons to see if the 8 possible neighbours are also in the cluster and one addition to increment @xmath47 ) .",
    "if hacr has identified @xmath111 clusters , and cluster @xmath112 has @xmath113 pixels , this makes @xmath114 operations in total , assuming no overlap between the clusters .",
    "we do not know in advance how many clusters hacr will identify , nor how many pixels will be in each one , but @xmath115 necessarily , and @xmath116 since we choose the minimal lower threshold that we use to avoid exceeding this limit ( this will be described in the next subsection )",
    ".    in practice , to run the hacr search with a single set of tuned thresholds on a spectrogram containing a single source , and with lisa and box size parameters as described in the previous subsection , takes about @xmath117 minute on a @xmath118ghz workstation .",
    "if more sources were present , this time would be larger since more clusters would be identified , but @xmath64 minutes would be an upper limit .",
    "this should be compared to the cost of the semi - coherent search which requires @xmath119 years on a @xmath120tflops cluster @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that noise characterisation and tuning of hacr is more expensive , since it involves using low thresholds ( thus increasing the number of hacr clusters identified ) , and repeating over many noise realisations . however , to complete @xmath121 tuning runs using @xmath122 nodes of a typical computer cluster still takes only a few hours .",
    "tuning hacr is a two step process .",
    "firstly , simulated noisy data is analysed in order to identify threshold triplets @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 which yield a specified false alarm probability , @xmath75 , for each box size , @xmath126 . secondly , a stretch of simulated data containing both noise and a signal is analysed using these threshold triplets and the detection rate ( or probability ) is measured . for each value of false alarm probability considered",
    "we can then choose the threshold triplet that gives the largest detection rate .",
    "in this way , we obtain the optimum receiver operator characteristic ( roc ) curve for the detection of a particular source . throughout the paper",
    ", we will use the terms detection _ rate _ and false alarm _ probability",
    "_ in order to make a distinction between event candidates caused by a signal or by noise .",
    "what we are really computing as the detection _ rate _ is the detection probability , i.e. , the fraction of lisa missions in which a particular source would be detected if we had many realisations of lisa .",
    "a more relevant observational quantity is the fraction of sources of a given type in the universe that would be detected in a _",
    "lisa observation .",
    "the population of lisa events will have random sky positions , plunge times and plunge frequencies .",
    "they therefore sample different parts of the time - frequency spectrogram , which to some extent mimics averaging over noise realisations .",
    "the detection rate can thus be taken as a guide to the fraction of sources similar to the given one that would be detected in the lisa mission .",
    "a more accurate assessment of the fraction of sources detected requires injection of multiple identical sources simultaneously , but we do not consider that problem here .    to characterize the noise properties of the search we used @xmath127 noise realisations and analysed them for twenty choices of @xmath71 and with the threshold @xmath72 set as low as",
    "is sensibly possible , recording the peak power , @xmath128 , and size , @xmath51 , of every cluster detected .",
    "with such a list of clusters , it is possible during post - processing to obtain the number of false alarm detections that would be made using any of the twenty lower thresholds , @xmath53 , any value of @xmath129 and any value of @xmath130 .",
    "the value of @xmath131 has to be chosen carefully .",
    "if it is too low , many clusters will be found in every noise realisation , increasing the computational cost .",
    "if it is too high , too few clusters will be identified to give reasonable statistics .",
    "we used values of @xmath131 chosen to ensure that a few clusters were found for each box size in each noise realisation .",
    "the lower threshold has to be less than or equal to@xmath131 .",
    "if it is set too low , large portions of the time - frequency map can be identified as a single cluster .",
    "therefore , we choose the minimum value of @xmath71 to ensure that all clusters are of reasonable size , which we define to be less than @xmath132 pixels . by examining cluster properties in a few thousand noise realisations , we found suitable empirical choices to be @xmath133 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note that for large box sizes , @xmath134 and so we set @xmath135 . above this point , we no longer ensure that at least one cluster is found for each box size , as this is inconsistent with the more important requirement that no cluster exceeds @xmath132 pixels . we emphasise that our search is robust to the somewhat arbitrary choice of these minimal values . for box sizes",

    "we want the thresholds in a given box size to contribute an _ additional _ false alarm rate of @xmath75 . when determining the threshold triplets we therefore need to ignore realisations in which false alarms have already been found .",

    "a detection is defined as any realisation in which all thresholds are exceeded in at least one box size .",
    "the box sizes are searched in the order they were constructed ( see figure  [ binning ] ) . as discussed in the previous section , if a detection has been made for one box size , we want to ignore that realisation when we search with subsequent box sizes .",
    "this ensures that we always choose the threshold triplet for a box size that provides the maximum number of _ additional _ detections . in practice",

    "this gives @xmath162 events gpc@xmath163 yr@xmath164 . assuming a 3 year lisa mission , and that the detection rates quoted here are a good approximation to the fraction of emri events that lisa would detect in a single realisation of the mission , these rates translate to a detection of @xmath165@xmath166 events using this method ( using a euclidean volume - distance relation ) .",
    "we note , however , that at the high end of this range , source confusion will be a significant problem and it has been ignored in the current work .      in figure  [ expowhacrcomparison ]",
    "we also show roc curves for using the excess power search to detect source `` a '' at a range of distances . since hacr effectively performs the excess power search when @xmath167 we expect that hacr will always do at least as well as the excess power search . due to the extra levels of tuning allowed by the hacr algorithm",
    "we find that it can obtain a somewhat higher detection rate for a given false alarm probability .",

    "however , as illustrated in figure  [ threshrel ] , the optimal hacr pixel threshold tends to be significantly greater than @xmath117 .",
    "thus , hacr identifies clusters containing significant numbers of pixels , while the excess power search at the first stage identifies only individual pixels .",

    "the information contained in the structure of hacr clusters should allow parameter estimation which can be used as input for later stages in a hierarchical search .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in section  [ paramest ] .    as mentioned earlier",
    ", the fact that realisations in which detections are made are omitted for the search of subsequent box sizes treats the earlier box sizes preferentially .",
    "we repeated the roc calculation with the box search order randomized in various ways .",
    "it was clear from this that the overall search performance was independent of the box size search order .",
    "we recommend using the order given by the efficient binning algorithm described earlier because of the computational savings .      in figure  [ ratevsbinlab ]",
    "we show how the detection rate depends on the box size .",
    "this figure shows the number of detections made for each box size over the 1000 realisations used for determination of the roc curve for source `` a '' at 2gpc .",
    "it is clear that there is not only one single box size that makes detections , but several box sizes are important .",
    "this is because random noise fluctuations will sometimes make one box size better than another .",
    "however , it is also clear that many of the box sizes do not make any detections and are apparently not very useful for the detection of this particular source .",
    "this is partially due to the box size search order .",
    "figure  [ ratevsbinlab ] also shows the detection rate as a function of the box size label when the search order was randomized .",
    "although the distribution is qualitatively similar , the box sizes that make the detections are different in this case .",
    "it is clear that there are several box sizes that are equally good at detecting this source ( these have approximately the same dimension in frequency , but different dimensions in time ) . whichever of these equivalent box sizes is used first",
    "will make the detection , although the overall number of detections and roc performance is independent of the search order .",
    "given that we have specified thresholds so that each box size contributes equally to the overall false alarm probability we might expect the search to perform better if we restrict it to use only those few box sizes responsible for most of the detections of the injected signal . by eliminating box sizes that make few detections , we expect to reduce the overall false alarm probability while keeping the overall detection rate approximately constant , thereby improving the overall roc performance .",
    "this can be investigated by re - analysing the data using only a small subset ( @xmath149 ) of the 119 box sizes originally considered , that were responsible for the most detections of emri source `` a '' .",
    "having performed the search using only @xmath149 box sizes , we can eliminate the box size which has the worst performance ( i.e. , the least number of detections ) _ in the @xmath149 box search _ and then repeat the search with the remaining @xmath171 box sizes .",
    "this process can be repeated , eliminating one box size each time , until only one box size remains .",
    "the box size that contributes the fewest detections depends to a limited extent on the ( additional ) false alarm probability assigned to each box size .",
    "we used the additional false alarm probability that gave an overall search false alarm probability of @xmath172 since , as argued earlier , this would be a reasonable value to use in the final lisa search .",
    "the results of this targeting procedure are summarized in table  [ targsearchroc ] . when the number of box sizes is reduced from @xmath173 to @xmath149",
    ", the roc performance does improve as the overall fap reduces , while the detection rate remains largely unchanged .",
    "this improvement is of the order of @xmath174 in detection rate . as the number of box sizes used is reduced further ,",
    "the roc performance remains roughly constant until only @xmath175 box sizes are being used .",
    "using fewer than @xmath175 box sizes leads to performance that degrades and is always worse than the full search .",

    "the trend as box sizes are removed is the same , but the hacr search always outperforms the excess power search    we conclude that it is possible to improve the performance of the search for a specific source by targeting to fewer box sizes",
    ". however , the improvement is not hugely significant .",
    "this is consistent with what was found for the excess power search @xcite . since the box sizes that are efficient for the detection of one particular source will almost certainly not be the same as those that are efficient for other sources , the best approach is to include all the box sizes in the search",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the results described in the preceding sections have focused on the detection of one particular emri , source `` a '' .",
    "we have also explored the performance of hacr in detecting some of the other emri sources used for the investigation of the excess power search @xcite .",
    "specifically we used the sources `` k '' and `` n '' , which have the same parameters as source `` a '' except for eccentricity .",
    "the source `` k '' is initially circular , while source",
    "`` n '' has eccentricity of @xmath176 , compared to @xmath177 for source `` a '' .",
    "we placed these sources at a range of distances between 1.8gpc and 2.6gpc , and injected them into noise realisations .",
    "we were thus able to determine roc curves for detection of these sources via the method described in section  [ hacrtune ] .",
    "in figure  [ sigakn_2gpcroc ] we compare the roc curves for detection of these sources with hacr when they are at a distance of 2gpc .",
    "we see that our ability to detect a system at a given distance is better for binaries in circular orbits ( source `` k '' ) than for systems with eccentric orbits ( sources `` a '' and `` n '' ) .",
    "this is consistent with what was found for the excess power search in @xcite .",
    "the predominant effect of orbital eccentricity is to split the gw radiation power into multiple harmonics . as the eccentricity increases ,",
    "the frequencies of these harmonics become increasingly separated . as a consequence ,",
    "a given box in the time - frequency map contains a smaller ratio of signal power to noise power .",
    "the detectability of emri sources therefore decreases as the eccentricity is increased .",
    "the performance of the hacr search for other sources considered in @xcite is similar in general .",
    "the overall detectability follows the same pattern as the excess power search .",
    "hacr has a slightly greater detection rate than excess power when the source is nearby , but as the source is put further away , the performance of hacr and excess power become comparable before the random limit is reached .",
    "however , in all cases , the hacr detection is made with a smaller upper threshold ( @xmath72 ) than excess power , compensated by a larger pixel threshold ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "thus , hacr detections identify clusters with significant numbers of pixels , the properties of which will be invaluable for subsequent parameter estimation .",
    "this will be discussed in section  [ paramest ] and will also be the subject of a follow - up paper that is currently in preparation .      in the preceding sections , we have focused on detection of a single source at a fixed distance . however , in the actual analysis of lisa data , we will not know a priori what sources will be in the data stream , and so the hacr thresholds need to be tuned as generally as possible . even in the case of a single emri source",
    ", the optimal threshold combination depends to some extent on the distance at which the source is placed .",
    "this is in contrast to the excess power search , where there is only one threshold that is uniquely determined by the choice of false alarm probability .",
    "there are two possible approaches to constructing a general hacr search  1 ) have several separate hacr searches , targeting different sources and using different sets of thresholds or 2 ) have a single hacr search with a set of thresholds chosen to be sensitive to as many lisa sources as possible . to date , we have focussed on the latter approach , since our results have shown that it is possible to do almost as well with a single set of `` generic '' thresholds as with source specific thresholds .",
    "as a first step , we took the thresholds designed to optimally detect source `` a '' at 2gpc and used those thresholds to search for sources `` k '' and `` n '' .",
    "we found that there was some degradation of performance , but that this was negligible . at an @xmath74 of @xmath157 , the detection rate for source",
    "`` k '' changed from @xmath179 to @xmath180 , and that of source `` n '' changed from @xmath181 to @xmath182 .",
    "this is a promising result and suggests that certain threshold combinations do well at detecting all the emri events .",
    "it is also possible to tune the thresholds to be generally sensitive to many different sources .",
    "this is not really necessary for the case of emri detection , but we will describe the procedure here as it will be needed when other types of source are included in the search .",
    "we want to tune the search to maximize the total lisa event rate ( i.e. , the number of events observed ) .",
    "if we knew in advance which sources would be present in the lisa data , we could tune the search by considering multiple noise realisations with that family of sources injected and choosing the threshold combination that gives the maximum total detection rate for given @xmath74 .",
    "since we do not know what the actual sources in the lisa data will be , we can instead tune the thresholds to be as sensitive as possible to a single event of unknown type , using prior knowledge to weight the relative likelihood of different types of event .",
    "this procedure ignores issues of source confusion , but should ensure that the loudest events are detected , no matter of what type or at what distance they might be .    in practice , tuning for multiple sources",
    "is done as follows :    * generate realisations of noise with injected signals for each of the sources we want to include in the tuning .",
    "* for the first box size , determine the rate of detections , @xmath183 , of each of the signals when using hacr with each threshold triplet , @xmath184 , that yields a pre - chosen @xmath75 . *",
    "construct a sum over these rates for each threshold triplet , @xmath185 , using an appropriate weighting factor , @xmath186 , for each source .",
    "* choose the threshold triplet that maximizes this weighted sum .",
    "for each signal , identify the realisations in which that optimal threshold triplet gave a detection . *",
    "move onto the next box size , but for each signal search only realisations in which the optimal thresholds for the previous box size(s ) did not yield any detections .",
    "* repeat for all box sizes .",
    "one question is what to use for the weighting factors . if we knew that only one type of source existed in the universe , but it was equally likely to be at any point in space , we want a volume weighted average",
    "this is done by taking our set of sources to be a single given source placed at a sequence of distances , @xmath187 .",
    "the source at distance @xmath187 can then be regarded to be representative of all sources in the range @xmath188 , and should be weighted by the ( euclidean ) volume of space in that range , @xmath189 .",
    "we carried out this procedure using source `` a '' at distances of @xmath190gpc , @xmath191gpc , ... ,",
    "@xmath192gpc , with weightings @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 ... @xmath196",
    "( we have neglected common factors of @xmath197 ) .",
    "we took the closest source to be at @xmath190gpc since up to that distance , the detection rate is always @xmath155 .",
    "this appears to give artificial weight to the @xmath190gpc source , but in practice this does not happen since virtually every threshold combination gives a @xmath155 detection rate for that source , and the variation in rate is determined primarily by the other injections .",
    "we used distance weighted thresholds to search for source `` a '' at various distances .",
    "the thresholds did change to some extent , but these changes were small since the optimal thresholds are almost independent of distance , and the overall roc performance was largely unaffected .",
    "we deduce that it is possible to detect a given emri source at any distance with a single set of thresholds .",
    "lisa will see more than one type of source , and we can fold in prior information about the relative abundance of different events by adjusting the weighting factors .",
    "we repeated the above , tuning for sources `` a '' , `` k '' and `` n '' at a single distance of @xmath99gpc , and given equal weighting . in that case too , we found that the roc performance was not significantly changed when tuning for these multiple sources .",
    "we also tuned for all three sources , placed at all the distances , @xmath190gpc , ... , @xmath192gpc , with the volume weightings listed previously . once again , the roc performance was not significantly altered .",
    "thus , there is a single set of hacr thresholds that can detect all three emri sources at any distance",
    ".    these results may not be truly generic , since the three emri sources are quite similar , differing only in eccentricity .",
    "it is therefore perhaps unsurprising that a single set of thresholds can detect all three sources almost optimally .",
    "however , we will see in section  [ multtune ] that this result carries over to the case when the sources have quite different characteristics .",
    "this is not totally surprising , since we know that hacr includes the excess power search as the pixel threshold @xmath198 limit .",
    "the excess power search thresholds are independent of the tuning source at fixed assigned fap .",
    "thus , a hacr search tuned for a collection of sources can do no worse than the excess power search for each of those sources . since the hacr search does not seem to hugely outperform the excess power search , we would not anticipate that this combined tuning procedure would lead to a serious degradation of performance even when considering very different classes of source .",
    "we have shown that hacr may be successfully tuned in order to detect multiple emri sources with different parameters . in this section",
    "we investigate hacr s ability to detect other classes of signals , specifically white dwarf ( wd ) binaries and supermassive black hole ( smbh ) binary mergers .",
    "we expect these other classes of signal to have quite different structure in a time - frequency map .",
    "a typical emri signal consists of several frequency components ( due to the eccentricity of the orbit ) , which `` chirp '' slowly over the course of the observation , i.e. , the frequency and amplitude increase .",
    "by contrast , the gw emission from a wd binary is essentially monochromatic .",
    "a smbh binary inspiral also gives a chirping signal , but the chirp occurs much more quickly than the emri due to the increased mass ratio , so it will be characterised by a signal that is broader in frequency .",
    "this difference in structure allows hacr to be tuned for all three types of source simultaneously .      as a preliminary investigation",
    ", we repeated the tuning procedure described earlier , injecting a typical smbh binary inspiral and a typical wd binary at various distances .",
    "the smbh binary waveform represented the inspiral of two @xmath28 non - spinning black holes , placed at a random sky position , and with merger occurring @xmath199 weeks before the end of the observation .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sourcemodel ] , our smbh injections use the waveform model given in @xcite .",
    "this is a restricted post - newtonian waveform accurate to 1.5pn .",
    "more accurate waveforms are available in the literature , with post - newtonian corrections up to 3.5pn .",
    "however , the simple model captures the main features of a smbh merger signal and is accurate enough for the more qualitative nature of this preliminary study .",
    "the quoted masses are the intrinsic masses of the black holes , i.e. , not redshifted .",
    "when the source was placed at higher redshift there are therefore two effects  an increase in the luminosity distance to the source , and a redshifting effect  which pushes the signal into the less sensitive part of the lisa noise curve . in figure",
    "[ smbhwdalldist ] we show the roc curves for detection of this smbh binary source at a range of redshifts . at each redshift",
    "the optimal thresholds were chosen using the tuning method described in section  [ hacrtune ] .",
    "we find that smbh binary sources at redshifts @xmath200 are detected with almost perfect efficiency using hacr , but we stop being able to resolve signals for redshifts @xmath201 .",
    "this is primarily because the ( matched filtering ) snr of the source decreases significantly due to the redshifting effect mentioned above .",
    "the `` typical '' wd binary was chosen to have the parameters of rxj0806.3 + 1527 ( as quoted in @xcite ) , except for distance and sky position .",
    "the latter was chosen randomly , but this choice , and the noise model used meant the snr of this source at a distance of @xmath117kpc was approximately a factor of @xmath14 greater than that quoted in @xcite .",
    "this should be born in mind when considering the distances quoted in the following discussion . in figure  [ smbhwdalldist ]",
    "we show the roc curve for this wd source , injected at various distances . at distances",
    "@xmath202kpc , we obtain near perfect detection using hacr .",
    "the sensitivity falls off rapidly for greater distances and the source becomes undetectable at greater than @xmath203kpc . even allowing for the snr discrepancy mentioned above , this source would be detectable at @xmath204@xmath205kpc , so almost at the distance of the galactic center . since this particular source is estimated to be at a distance of @xmath206@xmath121pc",
    ", it would be detectable via this method .",
    "we would expect to detect other similar white dwarfs at distances of @xmath117@xmath64kpc depending on the source parameters .",
    "this does not allow for source confusion , as we have only injected single sources into the data stream , but the conclusion for rxj0806 should be robust , since it radiates at @xmath9mhz , which is in the regime where wd binaries are well separated in frequency ( this can be seen in the results of population synthesis models described in @xcite and is reflected in the lisa noise curve ( [ lisash ] ) in which the contribution from wd binaries , accounting for resolvability of sources , is below the instrumental noise at @xmath148mhz ) .    in the preceding plots ,",
    "the hacr thresholds have been tuned to detect the source in question , at a particular distance .",
    "if instead we imagined that we would use only one set of thresholds , tuned for emri source `` a '' at a distance of 2gpc , then the roc performance for detection of the smbh binary and wd binary events is significantly degraded .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ testsiga2gpcthresh ] , which compares the roc curve for detection of the smbh binary at redshift @xmath207 and the wd binary at a distance of @xmath7kpc when the emri thresholds are used , versus the result when the source specific tuned thresholds are used .",
    "we chose distances of @xmath208 and @xmath7kpc since in that case the sources are loud , but have less than a @xmath155 detection rate , so we will be able to see roc variations .",
    "figure  [ testsiga2gpcthresh ] shows that using the emri thresholds to detect other sources typically reduces the detection rate by a factor of @xmath209 at an @xmath74 of @xmath157 .",
    "one solution to this problem in a lisa search would be to run several independent searches focussed on different source families .",
    "however , it is also possible to tune a single set of hacr thresholds to be sensitive to all three types of source simultaneously .",
    "this is done in the same way as the source and distance - averaged tuning described in section  [ multemritune ] , but now we inject not only emri signals , but also wd and smbh signals . when the thresholds are tuned using emri source `` a '' at 2gpc , the wd binary at 17kpc and the smbh binary at @xmath208 with equal weighting , the detection rate at an @xmath74 of @xmath157 for the emri source `` a '' at 2gpc is @xmath210 as opposed to @xmath211 using optimal tuning .",
    "this difference is of the same order as the expected error in our roc estimates ( see section  [ hacrtune ] ) and is therefore considered to be negligible . for the smbh binary at @xmath208 and the wd binary at 17kpc the change in detection rate when using the thresholds tuned for all three sources when compared to th detection rate obtained using the optimal thresholds is also negligible .",
    "it is clear that when the thresholds are tuned for all three types of source , the performance of hacr is almost as high as the source specific searches , and still exceeds the performance of the excess power search . that this is possible follows from the different time - frequency properties of the three types of source .",
    "the time - frequency properties of a source determine which box sizes are good for its detection .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ bestbin ] , which shows schematically all box sizes that contribute more than @xmath212 of the detection rate for four different sources : emris `` a '' and `` k '' , the wd binary and the smbh binary inspiral . physically , we expect wd binary tracks to be virtually monochromatic , and of long duration",
    ". therefore we might expect to detect such sources in box sizes that are long in time but very narrow in frequency .",
    "the smbh binary inspiral ( at that redshift ) is fairly short in duration , but sweeps through a reasonable range in frequency and is also quite loud .",
    "therefore , we might expect to see it in boxes that are narrow in time , and broader in frequency .",
    "emris are similar in structure to smbh binary inspirals , but last longer in time and evolve more slowly . for a circular emri ( e.g. , source `` k '' ) , one might expect to detect it in boxes that were long in time and quite narrow in frequency , although shorter in time and slightly broader in frequency than the wd binary ( since the frequency changes as the source inspirals ) .",
    "however , an eccentric emri ( e.g. , source `` a '' ) will have multiple frequency harmonics , and one might expect to do better using a slightly broader box in frequency which then includes more of the frequency components .",
    "the distribution in figure  [ bestbin ] fits precisely with this physical intuition .",
    "when tuning for multiple sources , the threshold in a given box size will be determined by the source that the box size is most suited to detecting .",
    "the fact that the various types of source favour distinct groups of box sizes means the overall performance is comparable to the source specific performance .",
    "the box sizes in which hacr detections are made thus provide an additional way to classify the source type .     of the detections of that source in 1000 realisations .",
    "the sources are identified by the patterns in the key .",
    "box sizes that were good for several sources are indicated by multiple patterns , e.g. the box with co - ordinates ( 0,7).,height=480 ]",
    "we have emphasised throughout this paper that , although the hacr search does not provide a much greater detection rate than the excess power search , the clusters it identifies may be used to characterize the source .",
    "parameters estimated from hacr clusters can then be used as input for other algorithms in subsequent stages of a hierarchical search of the lisa data .",
    "an excess power detection essentially contains two pieces of information  the time and frequency at which the detection is made .",
    "since we are using binning as part of the search , there is also some information contained in the box size(s ) used to bin the spectrogram(s ) in which the detection(s ) is ( are ) made .",
    "to gain further information , a detection made by excess power must be followed by a track identification stage , and this is currently being investigated @xcite .",
    "a hacr cluster by contrast consists not of one but many pixels .",
    "thus , in addition to the previous properties , the hacr cluster has shape information which is potentially a much more powerful diagnostic",
    ". the information that can be extracted ranges from the size of the event in time and frequency to the shape and curvature of the boundary of the cluster . an event that is short in the time direction but broad in frequency might be an instrumental noise burst , whereas events long in time and narrow in frequency are probably inspiral events . the difference in frequency between the latest and earliest pixels in the cluster , divided by the difference in time ,",
    "provides an estimate of the rate of change of frequency ( or chirp rate ) of the event .",
    "the shape parameters @xcite of the cluster also provide diagnostics which might be able to distinguish instrumental bursts from astrophysical bursts from long lived astrophysical events . as mentioned elsewhere , source confusion is a major issue for lisa , with many events likely to be overlapping in time and frequency in the data stream .",
    "a detection in the time - frequency plane could therefore either be a single source or several overlapping sources .",
    "an analysis of the cluster boundary should be able to distinguish these two cases in certain situations , i.e. , distinguish a `` cross '' from a `` line '' .",
    "the power profile in the cluster is also a potentially useful diagnostic .",
    "one use would be to distinguish crossing tracks from inspirals as above .",
    "additionally , the power profile along an inspiral track would reveal the modulations associated with the motion of the detector and thus provide a diagnostic of sky position . in a more sophisticated analysis , cluster properties would allow different clusters that are generated by the same event to be identified .",
    "an emri is characterized by several different frequency components and these might well appear as different clusters in a time - frequency analysis ( see spectrograms in @xcite ) .",
    "however , these tracks remain almost parallel as they evolve , and so the rate of change of frequency provides a way to connect the tracks in a second stage analysis of the hacr clusters . if tracks can be identified like this , the properties , such as the track separation , encode information about the orbital eccentricity etc .",
    "one complication in all of this is that the construction of the binned spectrograms makes use of bins that overlap in time and frequency .",
    "this has the effect of smearing out tracks from astrophysical sources and noise events in the data , which complicates cluster characterisation and parameter extraction . in analysing cluster properties",
    ", this effect must be accounted for , or methods derived to deconvolve the effect of binning once a source has been identified .    it is clear that hacr cluster properties are a potentially powerful tool both for vetoing , i.e. , distinguishing astrophysical events from instrumental artefacts , and for parameter estimation .",
    "work is currently underway to investigate which of these and other cluster properties are most powerful as diagnostics , and how the system s parameters may be estimated from them .",
    "however , we leave a fuller discussion of this analysis and the results for a future paper .",
    "in this paper we have described a time - frequency algorithm , the hierarchical algorithm for clusters and ridges , that can be used to detect gravitational wave signals in lisa data .",
    "the algorithm extends the simple excess power search described elsewhere @xcite and is similar to the tfclusters algorithm used for ligo data analysis @xcite .",
    "we have investigated how the thresholds in the hacr algorithm may be tuned for specific sources and examined the performance of the algorithm for detection of three expected lisa sources  extreme mass ratio inspirals , white dwarf binaries and supermassive black hole mergers .",
    "our results suggest that the algorithm can detect typical emri events at distances of up to @xmath17gpc , typical wd binary events at several kpc ( up to @xmath149kpc for our favourably oriented example ) and typical smbh merger events at up to redshift @xmath213 .",
    "moreover , we have demonstrated that it is possible to tune hacr to be sensitive to all three of these distinct waveform families simultaneously .",
    "this is possible because the time - frequency structure of the sources is quite different .",
    "a key ingredient of the search ( as in the excess power search ) is to bin the data using boxes of certain sizes .",
    "the time - frequency structure of the waveform family determines which boxes are well - suited to their detection , and these sets of box sizes are largely distinct for the different waveform types .",
    "this allows the overall search to be tuned for all three source families .",
    "the hacr search includes the excess power search as a special case ( i.e. , when the pixel threshold is set equal to one ) .",
    "hacr must therefore perform at least as well as the excess power search .",
    "in fact , we find that for the detection of a single source hacr has a detection rate about @xmath214 better than the excess power search",
    ". this may seem like a modest improvement , but it translates to a fairly significant enhancement in event rate . for sources at distances close to the detection limit , the hacr and excess power searches have very similar performance .",
    "moreover , hacr represents an improvement over excess power since the hacr events are clusters containing several hundred pixels , rather than the single pixel identified in the excess power search .",
    "parameter extraction from an excess power search requires a follow up stage of track identification @xcite .",
    "the hacr pixel clusters , on the other hand , already directly encode information about the type of source and the source parameters .",
    "we have discussed some ways in which information can be extracted from the cluster and mapped into physical parameters , but we reserve a more in - depth discussion of this important part of the search for a future paper .",
    "the current work contains some limitations which will also be explored in the future .",
    "the exploration of the waveform parameter space has been far from exhaustive  we have considered only a few emri sources , plus single examples of signals from wd binaries and smbh binaries . a more thorough examination of the parameter space is required to fully assess the usefulness of hacr in terms of likely lisa event rates .",
    "our model for the lisa data stream is also somewhat simplified  we have used a low - frequency approximation , rather than the full tdi description of the detector output . while these approximations should not seriously change the conclusions , it will be important to model lisa more accurately in future studies .",
    "the most significant limitation in the current work is the fact that we have considered the extraction of a single event from noisy data . in practice",
    ", the lisa data stream will contain many thousands of events overlapping in time and frequency",
    ". the performance of hacr and other techniques will be very different under those circumstances than under the ideal conditions considered here .",
    "however , the most likely effect of source confusion will just be to limit the distance to which sources can be seen",
    ". we should still be able to identify the loudest handful of events using this or more sophisticated techniques , at considerably lower computational cost than many other approaches .",
    "the cluster properties will also provide additional information to help disentangle multiple crossing tracks .",
    "the performance of hacr in a source - dominated data stream will also be explored in the future .",
    "in addition , we plan to assess hacr by analysing the lisa mock data challenge data sets @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we hope that hacr , or some similar time - frequency technique , will be able to provide a computationally cheap first stage in a hierarchical search of lisa data .",
    "the parameter estimates obtained from the clusters can the be used as input for subsequent follow up with matched filtering or markov chain monte carlo techniques .",
    "this should allow detection of the loudest @xmath98s of lisa events for a very low computational overhead .",
