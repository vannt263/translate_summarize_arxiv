    "this paper is the second in a series presenting @xmath18-dropout ( @xmath19 ) quasars selected from the multicolor imaging data of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite , @xcite ) . in @xcite and in paper",
    "i ( @xcite ) , we presented the discovery of four quasars at @xmath20 , 5.82 , 5.99 and 6.28 , respectively , selected from @xmath21 deg@xmath2 of sdss imaging data in the northern galactic cap .",
    "the observations of these quasars provide important probes to the high - redshift universe .",
    "they indicate the existence of supermassive black holes with @xmath22 at @xmath0 when the universe was less than 1 gyr old .",
    "the presence of strong metal emission lines in these quasars suggests strong chemical enrichment and strong star - forming activity in the quasar environment at early epoch .",
    "the thickening of the ly @xmath6 forest , and the detection of a complete gunn - peterson trough in the @xmath23 quasar sdss j1030 + 0524 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , indicate that the ionizing background is declining rapidly , and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) neutral fraction is rising sharply at @xmath9 , suggesting that we might be close to the epoch of reionization at this redshift ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the discovery of three quasars at @xmath5 , 6.23 and 6.43 , selected from @xmath24 deg@xmath2 of new sdss imaging data .",
    "the scientific objectives , photometric data reduction , target selection and follow - up observation procedures are described in detail in paper i. the new observations used a slightly relaxed set of selection criteria , and are outlined briefly in  2 .",
    "we present the spectroscopic observations of the three new quasars , and discuss their spectral properties in  3 . in  4 , we combine the new quasars with those presented in paper i and recalculate the spatial density of luminous @xmath9 quasars , taking into account the effect of our color selection criteria .",
    "we also put constraints on the bright - end slope of the quasar luminosity function based on this quasar sample . at @xmath25 ,",
    "the quasars presented in this paper and in paper i are the most luminous objects at high redshift , and the probability of their being gravitationally lensed is boosted by the magnification bias ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "high - resolution images of these quasars are presented in  5 in order to uncover possible gravitational lensing .",
    "none of the objects appears to be lensed under image resolution from 0.1@xmath26 ( hst ) to 0.8@xmath26 ( ground - based ) .",
    "we use this observation to set a limit on the magnification bias and thus to constrain the slope of the quasar luminosity function . in a subsequent paper ( fan et al .",
    "2003 ) , we discuss the absorption spectra of these quasars and their implication on the reionization epoch in greater detail .    as in paper",
    "i , the results are presented using two different cosmologies : a @xmath27-dominated universe with @xmath28 km s@xmath29 mpc@xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xcite ) , which is referred to as the @xmath27-model ; and an einstein - de sitter universe with @xmath32 and @xmath33 = 50 km s@xmath29 mpc@xmath29 , which we refer to as the @xmath32 model in this paper .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey is using a dedicated 2.5 m telescope and a large format ccd camera ( @xcite ) at the apache point observatory in new mexico to obtain images in five broad bands ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath18 and @xmath37 , centered at 3551 , 4686 , 6166 , 7480 and 8932  , respectively ; @xcite ) in 10000 deg@xmath2 of high galactic latitude sky . about @xmath38 deg@xmath2 of imaging data",
    "have been collected at the time of this writing ( november 2002 ) .",
    "the imaging data are processed by the astrometric pipeline ( @xcite ) and photometric pipeline ( @xcite ) , and are photometrically calibrated to a standard star network ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .    at @xmath39 , the ly @xmath6 emission line in the quasar spectrum",
    "moves out of the @xmath18 band and into the @xmath37 band , the reddest filter in the sdss system .",
    "quasars at higher redshift are characterized by their very red @xmath40 color .",
    "they are very faint or are completely undetected in the @xmath18 band due to the strong ly @xmath6 forest absorption in that band , and become _",
    "@xmath18-dropout objects _ with only one measurable color ( or its lower limit ) in sdss photometry .",
    "as discussed in detail in paper i , because of the extreme rarity of very high - redshift quasars and the overwhelming number of possible contaminants , mostly cosmic rays in the @xmath37 band and very cool dwarfs ( spectral types l and t ) , the photometric selection procedure of @xmath8 quasar candidates is quite complex .",
    "the procedures include further image processing to eliminate single - band cosmic rays ; independent @xmath37-band photometry to improve the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the @xmath40 color ; and @xmath41-band photometry , either from matching with the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , @xcite ) catalog for bright sources , or independent @xmath41-band measurement for fainter sources , in order to separate cool dwarfs from quasars , which have similar @xmath40 colors to those of @xmath8 quasars but much redder @xmath42 colors .",
    "paper i presents the results from a survey of @xmath18-dropout candidates in @xmath21 deg@xmath2 of sdss imaging carried out in the springs of 2000 and 2001 . in spring 2002",
    ", we searched for @xmath18-dropout quasar candidates in 48 new sdss imaging runs .",
    "these imaging data were taken between 27 april 2000 ( run 1411 ) and 2 april 2002 ( run 3103 ) .",
    "we used the same criterion to decide which photometric runs to include in the @xmath18-dropout survey as in paper i : the @xmath37 band image quality , measured by the psfwidth parameter ( @xmath43 fwhm for a gaussian profile ) in the fourth column of the sdss camera , should be better than 1.8@xmath26 .",
    "the median seeing in the @xmath18 and @xmath37 bands is @xmath44 for the entire survey area .",
    "the projection of the area covered by these runs is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "this area overlaps with the area covered by paper i , mostly in the overlap between adjacent sdss strips and stripes ( york et al . 2000 ) . taking these overlaps into account",
    ", we find that the total _",
    "new _ area of the sky covered by these runs is 1320 deg@xmath2 , bringing the combined sky coverage of paper i and this paper to 2870 deg@xmath2 .",
    "figures 2 and 3 present the @xmath45 vs. @xmath46 color - magnitude diagram , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath18 and @xmath37 .",
    "as the sdss photometric calibration system is still being finalized , the sdss photometry presented here is referred to as @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath46 . ] and the @xmath45 vs. @xmath51 color - color diagram that we use to select @xmath18-dropout candidates and to separate high - redshift quasar candidates from cool dwarfs . for quasars at @xmath52 ,",
    "a significant amount of @xmath37-band flux is also absorbed by the ly @xmath6 forest absorption , resulting in an increasingly red @xmath51 color towards higher redshift ( figure 3 ) .",
    "so in this paper , we extend the @xmath51 color to be redder than that in paper i in order to search for quasars at higher redshift .",
    "the final color - selection criteria are :    @xmath53    as in paper i , we require that the object not be detected in the @xmath34 , @xmath35 or @xmath36 bands . the photometric error in eq .",

    "the total exposure time was 3600 sec under partly cloudy skies .",
    "this initial spectrum shows a strong , broad emission ly @xmath6+nv emission line at @xmath61  and a clear lyman break , indicating that it is at a redshift of @xmath62 , thus making it the highest redshift quasar yet discovered .",
    "subsequently , we have obtained spectra with higher s / n using three telescopes : on 29 april 2002 , a moderate resolution ( @xmath63 ) spectrum was obtained with the cassegrain twin spectrograph ( twin ) on the calar alto 3.5 m telescope .",
    "the total exposure time was 3.5 hours under good sky conditions .",
    "the calar alto spectrum , which covers the spectral range of 8100  to 9800 , is shown in figure 5 . on 7",
    "may 2002 , a low resolution ( @xmath64 ) spectrum was obtained with the low resolution spectrograph ( lrs , @xcite ) on the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) with a total exposure time of 5100 seconds . on 8",
    "may and 10 may 2002 , moderate resolution spectra ( @xmath63 ) of sdss j1148 + 5251 were obtained using the echelle spectrograph imager ( esi , @xcite ) on the keck ii telescope .",
    "the sky was partly cloudy with variable extinction of @xmath65 mag .",
    "the total exposure time was 3 hours , although the s / n of the spectrum is worse than that in a 30 minute exposure on keck of a similarly faint object under good conditions , due to the clouds .",
    "the final combined keck spectrum ( binned to 2 / pixel ) is presented in figure 6 .",
    "while the presence of the ly@xmath6+nv emission line and lyman break is unambiguous , the determination of an accurate redshift of this quasar is far from straightforward .",
    "the ly@xmath6+nv emission line is quite weak .",
    "the rest - frame equivalent width is @xmath66 , compared to the average value of @xmath67  for quasars at @xmath68 ( schneider , schmidt , & gunn 1991 , @xcite ) .",
    "the blue side of the ly @xmath6 emission is almost totally absorbed by the ly @xmath6 forest , and nv emission does not show a separate peak .",
    "no other emission line is detected with the current s / n .",
    "we adopt a redshift of @xmath69 using the peak of ly @xmath6 emission and the onset of the lyman break .",
    "this value is quite uncertain , and a more accurate redshift can only be determined using strong metal lines such as civ , now redshifted well into the near infrared @xmath41-band .",
    "note , however , high - ionization lines such as civ are systematically blueshifted from the system redshift , which is better traced by low - ionization lines such as mgii , by several hundred km s@xmath29 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this will bias the redshift determined from civ line at the @xmath70 level at @xmath9 .",
    "we are able to identify an intervening civ doublet absorption system at @xmath71 in both the calar alto and keck spectra .",
    "this absorption system is discussed further in a subsequent paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that the ly@xmath6+nv emission line is very weak , while not unique among high - redshift quasars ( @xcite ) , is intriguing ( see also the discussion of sdss j1048 + 4637 below ) .",
    "clearly , a much larger sample is needed to study any trend in the evolution of the emission line strength among the highest redshift quasars .",
    "the other possible explanation for the weak line is that the ly@xmath6 emission in sdss j1148 + 5251 is affected by the presence of an intrinsic or associated nv absorption system , as in the case of sdss j10440125 ( fan et al .",

    "the continuum magnitude measured from the spectrum redward of ly@xmath6 emission ( @xmath76 ) is much brighter than the broad - band @xmath37-band magnitude ( @xmath77 ) which is affected by this absorption .",
    "if not gravitationally lensed ( see  5 ) , it is likely to be powered by a black hole of several billion solar masses , within a dark matter halo of order @xmath78 @xmath79 ( see the discussion in paper i ) .",
    "it is probably among the most luminous and massive objects in the universe at @xmath0 .",
