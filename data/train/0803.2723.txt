    "the quantum fluctuations are treated in quadratic approximation and their spectrum is obtained by solving a schrdinger like stability equation whose potential is given by the second spatial derivative of the metastable potential .",

    "i emphasize that the system is taken as non dissipative therefore the _ temperature _ should not be viewed here as a property of the heat bath @xcite , but rather as a measure of the system size along the time axis .",
