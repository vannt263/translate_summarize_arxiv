    "upcoming cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) polarization experiments are poised to immensely improve our understanding of the early universe .",
    "the significance of polarization lies not only in the fact that it increases the amount of data provided by temperature anisotropy alone but also because it is more sensitive to several physical processes which took place in the early universe , e.g. the gravitational wave background produced during inflation ( seljak & zaldarriaga [ 1 ] , kamionkowski , kosowsky & stebbins [ 2 ] ) and reionization ( zaldarriaga [ 3 ] , and fan , carilli & keating [ 4 ] ) . partially ( but not only ) due to this fact , cmb polarization has a unique dependence on the basic cosmological parameters .",
    "this feature can be used to remove some of the degeneracies afflicting cosmological parameter estimation from temperature anisotropy alone .",
    "one of the cmb polarization s main features is the dependence of its b - mode ( curl - like polarization ) on the amplitude of the stochastic gravitational wave background generically predicted by inflationary models . due to its faintness , the b - mode polarization is prone to degradation by various systematic effects on a wide range of scales and it is important to remove these spurious contributions .",
    "this must be done _ in addition _ to controlling the various systematics induced by diffuse galactic emission ( amblard , cooray & kaplinghat [ 5 ] ) and contamination from e - b mixing due to partial sky coverage ( lewis , challinor & turok [ 6 ] , de oliveira - costa & tegmark [ 7 ] , brown , castro & taylor [ 8 ] ) .",
    "this paper describes an analytic approach to assess systematics induced by imperfections of the polarimeter s main beam .",
    "several effects which contaminate the power spectra stem from temperature and polarization variations over scales comparable to the beamwidth ( hu , hedman & zaldarriaga [ 9 ] , ponthieu [ 10 ] , rosset et al . [ 11 ] , odea , challinor & johnson [ 12 ] ) ; these effects can be modelled and characterized by the spurious @xmath0 they produce .",
    "our results are power spectra presented as a combination of the underlying power spectra with mixing coefficients which are infinite sums of analytic functions . in practice however , this infinite series must be truncated and therefore our result is effectively equivalent to a series expansion .",
    "as expected , for small beam imperfections we find that the higher order corrections contribute negligibly to the spurious polarization .",
    "we define the small parameters characterizing the systematic effects in table i. they are ; the gain factor @xmath1 , the differential beamwidth of the beams @xmath2 , the differential pointing @xmath3 , the beam ellipticity @xmath4 and the beam rotation @xmath5 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows ; in section 2 we present the basic mathematical formalism of spin - weighted fields used to characterize the systematic effects , beam convolution , and our analytic results for the temperature - polarization leakage and polarization conversion in a single beam .",
    "ultimately , we consider bolometric polarimetry which is most conveniently described using the stokes parameters ( e.g , masi et al .",
    "[ 13 ] ) @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 for cmb polarization ) as opposed to the jones matrix formalism which is particularly useful for describing coherent polarimeters ( hu , hedman & zaldarriaga [ 9 ] , odea , challinor & johnson [ 12 ] ) .",
    "these parameters are derived from differences in intensity in the gaussian 2-d polarized beam response function for each polarization .",
    "our two - beam experiment and the induced power spectra are derived in section 3 and the numerical results for the b - mode power spectrum are described in section 4 .",
    "we end with a discussion of the impact of these effects in section 5 .",
    "we work entirely in fourier space and begin with the expansion of both temperature and @xmath7 and @xmath8 stokes parameters in plane waves .",
    "since all the effects considered here are due to the beam asymmetry , and the beamwidths are typically on the degree or sub - degree scale , we can safely employ the flat - sky approximation as far as effects related to the beam shape and size are considered .",
    "the underlying physical power spectrum is calculated by camb ( lewis , challinor & lasenby [ 14 ] ) using the full sky .",
    "the temperature and other ( integer - spin ) combinations of the stokes parameters are expanded in harmonic space as follows ( e.g. zaldarriaga & seljak [ 15 ] ) @xmath10 where the expansion coefficients of the spin @xmath11 polarization parameters can be presented in terms of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 polarization modes @xmath14 @xmath12 and @xmath13 are scalar and pseudoscalar under parity ( having even and odd parities ) respectively , and are sometimes referred to as the ` electric ' and ` magnetic ' ( or ` gradient ' and ` curl ' ) polarization components . in the flat sky approximation , eq.(1 )",
    "becomes @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the fourier components which are functions of the wave vector @xmath19 only .",
    "since in real space the temperature and polarization patterns are convolved with the beams , these expressions are simply the product of their fourier transforms in fourier space .",
    "we restrict the discussion to an elliptical gaussian beam ( with major and minor axes @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) @xmath22 and its fourier transform is @xmath23 the pointing error merely shifts the phase of the beam representation in fourier - space .",
    "it is useful to switch to polar coordinates at this point @xmath24 where the angles @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are defined below .",
    "the fourier representation of the beam ( eq.5 ) then becomes @xmath28 where @xmath29 the definitions of the parameters in terms of the mean beamwidth @xmath30 , differential beamwidth @xmath2 , and ellipticity @xmath4 , are given in table ii .",
    "employing the expansion of 2-d plane waves in terms of cylindrical bessel functions @xmath31 the definition of modified bessel function @xmath32 and the symmetry relation @xmath33 eq.(7 ) becomes @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the angle of the polarization axis in some coordinate system fixed to the sky ( fig .",
    "1 ) . we will employ this relation repeatedly in this work .",
    ".definitions of the parameters associated with the systematic effects .",
    "subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the first and second beams , respectively .",
    "the differential gain parameter @xmath1 and the beam rotation parameter @xmath5 are not related to the beam shape and therefore are not defined in eqs .",
    "( 7)-(8 ) , but rather are global parameters which define beam mismatch .",
    "we defer the exact definitions of these parameters to the relevant sections . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the stokes @xmath7 parameters associated with the polarization due to the optical imperfections discussed in this paper are shown in figure 2 .",
    "we have calculated all possible six power spectra ( eqs .",
    "24 and 33 ) for two different average beam widths fwhm @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "figures 3 - 8 depict beam rotation , differential pointing and differential ellipticities effects on the @xmath13-mode power spectrum for average beamwidths of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the dot - dashed lines refer to the inflation - induced @xmath13-mode from primordial gravitational waves with tensor to scalar ratios of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , where we have used the definition used in camb for the tensor - to - scalar ratio . for the plots of the second order differential pointing effect the specified pointing error @xmath3 refers to one of the beams ( we left the angle @xmath27 of this beam a free parameter ) , while the other beam has been assumed to have no pointing error .",
    "the quadrupole effect was calculated assuming the two beams have the _ same _ specified ellipticities , @xmath42 , and here we left the angles that the polarization axes make with the major axes of the two beams , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , as free parameters .",
    "we have defined @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "note that in the case considered here , that both beams have the same ellipticity @xmath42 , we obtain , as expected , that there in no spurious polarization when @xmath49 .",
    "similarly , had we assumed both beams have the same pointing @xmath3 we would have obtained no spurious polarization if @xmath50 in the case of the ideal scanning , where second order pointing is the leading order contribution ( not so in the case of non - ideal scanning , where the leading order is the dipole effect ) .",
    "as expected , the larger the beamwidths the larger the angular scales on which the systematics peak .",
    "the systematics are calculated for the small parameters ; @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath51 @xmath52 and @xmath53 % of the mean beam and @xmath3 and @xmath5 the same fractions of the mean beam and a radian , respectively .",
    "the scaling relations of these effects are given in tables iii - iv ( general scanning strategy ) and v - vi ( ideal scanning strategy ) .",
    "as explained in the last section , the higher order corrections ( beyond the leading order ) are important on some scale , typically @xmath54 which for @xmath55 and @xmath4 and @xmath2 on the 1% level corresponds to @xmath56 . on this scale , the @xmath13-mode from the cmb lensed by",
    "the large scale structure ( e.g. zaldarriaga & seljak [ 19 ] , hu [ 20 ] ) is non - negligible ( the dashed lines in figures 3 through 8) .",
    "however a beam that size is insensitive to features on scales of @xmath56 .",
    "it is also important to mention here that the effect due to rotation ( figures 3 and 6 ) closely follows the @xmath57 shape and merely reflects the leakage of @xmath12 to @xmath13 due to rotation ( eq .",
    "one more remark should be made regarding the coupling of the differential pointing and quadrupole effects mentioned above . as seen from eqs .",
    "( 12 ) the pointing error and ellipticity are coupled through products of the cylindrical and modified bessel functions . in practice",
    "however the coupling is small since the pointing error parameter @xmath58 is small . in this case , since the leading term of @xmath59 is @xmath60 it is safe to consider only the leading terms in the infinite sum in eq .",
    "( 12 ) , this approximation considerably simplifies numerical calculations . in calculating the plots we assumed perfect scanning strategy",
    "so the monopole and gain identically vanish as expected and as can be easily verified from eqs .",
    "( 12 ) , ( 21 ) and the relations in the appendix .",
    "again , it is important to note that the power spectra for the second order pointing error ( figures 4 and 7 ) and quadrupole ( figures 5 and 8) should be multiplied by the functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively , as described in tables iii , iv , v & vi .",
    "these functions can vanish .",
    "for instance , the effect of ellipticity will not contribute to the b - mode power spectra if the polarization sensitive axes are parallel to one of the ellipse principal axes ( @xmath65 ) , there is no shear of the field in this highly symmetric case and all the spurious polarization is in the e - mode as can be seen from table v. this is no longer the case with non - ideal scanning strategy ( table iii ) ; in this case the first order dipole do not depend on @xmath27 .",
    "also , if @xmath49 there will be no induced polarization by differential ellipticity , not in the e- , nor in the b - mode .",
    "similarly , for the pointing error , if @xmath66 , all the spurious polarization will contaminate the e - mode ( if the scanning strategy is ideal ) . the power spectrum associated with the underlying sky was calculated by camb using cosmological parameters consistent with wmap ( spergel et al .",
    "we ignore gravitational lensing and the tensor contribution to the underlying sky , but we do show them in the figures for reference .",
    "we stress again that nonvanishing @xmath67 and @xmath68 may indicate an incomplete removal of the spurious polarization signals discussed here .",
    "the relevant expressions are given in tables iv & vi .",
    "figures 9 to 11 show that @xmath67 peaks at the few @xmath2k level ( all these values are for ` maximum shear ' , i.e. @xmath69 or @xmath70 ) , and so constitute only upper limits for the given parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "only the contributions from ( second order ) differential pointing , differential ellipticity and differential rotation for the @xmath71 cross - correlation are displayed since the monopole and gain contributions identically vanish for an ideal scanning strategy .",
    "one more aspect of this analysis is the higher order corrections of the effects studied in this paper .",
    "we find that these corrections have little effect even on the smallest scales ( where the gradients are large ) in the ideal cases we studied .",
    "these effects become relatively large on scales much smaller than the mean beam size where beam dilution is significant .",
    "we conclude that at least for nearly ideal scanning strategy these higher order corrections can be safely neglected .",
    "the systematics discussed here , more than simply affecting the peak of the b - mode power spectrum at @xmath72 are likely to impact the polarization signal due to lensing at @xmath73 few hundreds as shown in figures 3 to 8 , at least for small beams . a full analysis of the effect of gravitational waves on cmb b - mode polarization is underway , and requires an assessment of the effect of gravitational lensing . the results presented in this paper show that the beam systematics are likely to further complicate this process both directly ( with a residual effect on degree scales ) and indirectly ( by mimicking the effect of lensing ) .",
    "while the lensing signal can be partially extracted by invoking optimal estimators that use the non - gaussianity of the lensed anisotropy and polarization ( hu & okamoto [ 31 ] ) , the systematics discussed here can not be removed by this method because they inherit the statistics of the underlying sky , which is gaussian in the standard model .",
    "the lensing - induced polarization is a direct probe of structure formation processes and is sensitive to few cosmological parameters , most notably the neutrino mass .",
    "an accurate analysis should take the beam effects discussed here into account .",
    "our calculation demonstrates that at most , these systematics are on the level of few tens to few hundredths of nk and their significance as contaminants of the primordial b - mode depends on the tensor to scalar ratio . comparing our results to the results of ponthieu [ 10 ]",
    "it is evident that the spurious power spectra calculated here are less noisy because they do not include the cosmic variance .",
    "the formalism described here directly employs the underlying power spectrum as opposed to ponthieu [ 10 ] whose results are based on producing synthetic cmb maps and their first and second spatial derivatives with healpix ( grski et al .",
    "these are combined with , e.g. the first order moments of the effective beam and hits distribution in each pixel , producing simulated ` observed ' maps ( including their systematic effects ) , and these maps can be studied by themselves or used to produce power spectra . although our analytic results are given in their most general form , including the effect of scanning strategy , in practice @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( eq .",
    "27 ) should be numerically calculated .",
    "this is consistently done by the approach employed by ponthieu [ 10 ] .",
    "our analysis shows that the contributions from higher order corrections and coupling between the various effects may be of some importance in principle , but for the cases studied here of a perfect elliptical gaussian beam with mean beamwidth @xmath77 and ellipticity and pointing error on the 5% level with a perfect scanning strategy , we find that the higher order corrections have a negligible effect on the angular scales of interest .",
    "another aspect is the potential use of the nonvanishing @xmath78 and @xmath79 power spectra as monitors of an imperfect removal of the spurious beam effects using the fact that these two power spectra are expected to identically vanish in the standard cosmological model .",
