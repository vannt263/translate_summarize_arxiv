    "analysis of the hubble deep field ( hdf ) ( williams _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) , which is to date the deepest optical image ever taken , has produced a remarkable series of important results both in galactic and extragalactic astronomy ( see ferguson _",
    "2000 for a summary ) . with the original hdf as a model",
    ", we proposed to carry out an hdf  like project in the nearest globular cluster , m4 .",
    "we were successful in obtaining a roughly similar amount of telescope time ( 123 orbits ) for the 2 filters f606w ( v  127,400 sec ) and f814w ( i  192,400 sec ) as had been granted for the hdf .",
    "our plan was to reach @xmath8 , @xmath9 with s / n about 3 in each filter in a single m4 field located 6 core radii ( @xmath10 ) from the cluster center  the same field which we observed in 1995 ( go 5461 ) .",
    "the main science driver was to search for the oldest and coolest white dwarfs ( wds ) in m4 .",
    "the discussion of the wd population in m4 is contained in the following _ letter _ ( hansen _ et al .",
    "other science goals are to attempt to identify the termination of the hydrogen burning ms and hence set the location of the brown dwarf boundary for metal  poor stars , establish the mf in the cluster down to very low masses and use the cluster wds to extend the mf beyond the cluster turnoff , investigate the binary frequency in the cluster both through the location of stars in the cmd and via variability , explore for planets through stellar occultations , and examine the inner halo populations ( rich _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 , in preparation ) and compare it with that of the cluster .",
    "the complete data set consists of 15@xmath112600 sec exposures in f555w , 9@xmath11800 sec in f814w ( 1995  part of go 5461 from cycle 4  see richer _ et al . _",
    "1995 , 1997 ; ibata _ et al . _",
    "1999 ) together with 98@xmath111300 sec in f606w and 148@xmath111300 sec obtained in f814w ( 2001  go 8679 in cycle 9 ) .",
    "all images were secured with the same roll angle in the same field of m4 located at about 6 core radii from the cluster center . we also processed and reduced the small set of f814w images from go 8153 but in the final reductions they were not used .",
    "the new images as well as the earlier frames were preprocessed according to the recipes given in stetson ( 1987 ) and stetson _ et al . _",
    "the individual frames were transformed to the coordinate system of the first new epoch frame using the montage2 program . once the frames were all on the same coordinate system , those _ corresponding to a particular epoch and filter _ were averaged together with pixel rejection ",
    "the n highest pixels being rejected to eliminate cosmic ray contamination . from the hst wfpc2 manual",
    "the mean number of pixels on a given chip affected by a cosmic ray hit in an 1800 sec exposure is about 20,000 .",
    "hence in a stack of n@xmath111300 sec exposures we expect 0.02257n pixels at a given position to have suffered a hit . taking the dispersion to be @xmath12 and using @xmath13 rejection we find that in combining the 98 f606w images the highest 7 pixels should be rejected while for the 148 f814w images we should eliminate the highest 9 .",
    "statistically this approach is superior to a median of the frames , which is equivalent to a mean of 2/3 of the number of frames , whereas in our procedure we used 93% of the images in constructing the mean .",
    "for each chip there are 4 combined frames , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "a starlist was generated for each chip using daofind on the @xmath16 and @xmath14 frames .",
    "we then ( 1 ) visually inspected each object in the list and rejected those objects that corresponded to detections of non - astronomical sources ( such as diffraction spikes ) , ( 2 ) subtracted a spatially smoothed copy of the image from the image itself and inspected this image for missed stars , and finally ( 3 ) combined the 2 lists into our final starlist .",
    "stars on each of the chips within the 4 frames were photometered using allstar with the starlist as input .",
    "allstar fits a psf to each object in the starlist and does recentering so as to achieve the best fit .",
    "note that the ability of allstar to recenter is essential as this allows shifts between stars on the frames to be measured which is critical when applying the starlist from the new frames onto the first epoch images as the proper motion of the cluster relative to the background amounts to about 1 hst pixel over the 6 year time baseline . to ensure that the individual frames were registered _ on _ the cluster stars , through an iterative process",
    ", we built a transformation file using only cluster stars ( about 240 per chip ) which move insignificantly relative to each other as the observed cluster velocity dispersion is 3.5 km / s ( peterson _ et al . _",
    "this amounts to a total internal mean motion of about 0.02 pixels over the 6 years . to compensate for distortions in the hst optics",
    ", we used a 20-term transformation equation .",
    "this is in lieu of but equivalent to applying the trauger _",
    "et al . _",
    "1995 corrections . to improve astrometric accuracy",
    ", we expanded the pc pixels by a factor of 2 and the wf pixels by a factor of 3 using montage2 .",
    "this process is similar to `` drizzling '' ( fruchter & hook 2002 ) .",
    "the individual frames were then averaged together with high pixel rejection as previously described .",
    "it was on these combined , expanded frames that the final photometry was carried out using allstar .",
    "no charge transfer corrections were made as the high background and the uniform distribution of the faint stars across the chips suggested that this was not a serious problem on these images .",
    "the resulting proper motion displacement ( pmd ) diagram ( figure 1 ) separates cluster stars from the field population rather cleanly .",
    "the clump of non - cluster stars in the pmd diagram clearly has a larger dispersion than that of the cluster ; with an internal velocity dispersion of only 0.02 pixels in 6 years , motions within m4 are unresolved to our level of precision . for stars in the v magnitude range 21 to 26 ,",
    "the measured pmd dispersion for the cluster is 0.082 pixels ( @xmath18 ) which we take as our positional measurement error ( confirmed by simulation ) while the field clump has a dispersion of 0.277 pixls ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "a complete discussion of this population will be given in rich _ et al . _",
    "( 2002 , in preparation ) .    in the lower two sections of figure 1 we display the cmds for data in different areas of the pmd diagram .",
    "the data were transformed to johnson v and kron - cousins i using stars measured in go 5461 and calibrated with ground - based data as discussed in richer _ et al . _",
    "this resulted in a significant color term in the transformation of f606w to johnson v. the transformation equations varied slightly from chip - to - chip but for wf2 it was @xmath20 .",
    "photometric measurement errors alone for ms stars as returned by allstar ranged from 0.02 magnitudes at @xmath21 ( 0.01 at @xmath22 ) to 0.07 at 29 ( 0.04 at @xmath23 ) .",
    "this resulted in @xmath24 errors in magnitude and color for a ms star at @xmath25 , @xmath26 of 0.10 and 0.12 respectively .",
    "the left panels plot all the objects ( stars as well as possible galaxies ) measured from all 4 chips with no rejection criteria .",
    "the central panels isolate the cluster stars ",
    "objects within 0.5 pixel in radius ( @xmath27 ) of the mean motion of the cluster .",
    "our simulations suggest that @xmath28% of cluster stars will have measured pmds outside this radius .",
    "the right panels contain the inner halo stars , again isolated with a 0.5 pixel radius circle centered on their mean motion with respect to the cluster .",
    "any faint unresolved galaxies will appear in this cmd .",
    "m4 is ideally suited for studies of the pop  ii hydrogen burning limit , by virtue of its proximity and relatively ( amongst globular clusters ) low concentration . from the ground ,",
    "the best attempt to study the lower main sequence was made by kanatas _",
    "et al_. 1995 , who were limited primarily by field star contamination .",
    "deep images using nicmos and wfpc on hst allowed pulone , de marchi & paresce 1999 to probe estimated masses down to @xmath29 , but with poor statistics . a second epoch of hst observations allowed bedin _ et al_. 2001 to separate cluster members from background stars using the cluster proper motion , with the faintest cluster members measured at @xmath30 with masses near @xmath5 .",
    "et al_. determined a completeness - corrected luminosity function , finding that their last bin at @xmath31 was statistically indistinguishable from zero .",
    "they note that if a larger number of stars are detected and this bin stays empty , then it would strongly indicate the location of the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "the considerably deeper observation described above allows us to examine this question in more detail .",
    "inspection of figure  1 shows that , while there is indeed a paucity of stars at @xmath32 , @xmath33 , there does remain a trail of potential ms stars extending redwards , almost to @xmath0 .",
    "these stars are present even with very restrictive proper motion cuts and have a high probability of cluster membership ( figure 2 ) so we are convinced that the lf does not have an abrupt termination bluer than @xmath34 .",
    "indeed , there is little reason to expect that it will as the current generation of low mass ms models ( baraffe _ et al . _",
    "1997 , cassisi _ et al . _  2000 ,",
    "montalban _ et al . _",
    "2000 ) all predict large changes in luminosity and color with very small changes in mass near the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "hence the approach to the hydrogen - burning mass limit should be characterised by an extended lf , such as is indeed seen in m4 .",
    "the least luminous ms stars observed in m4 are significantly fainter than any other known subdwarf at this metallicity ( leggett _ et al . _",
    "1998a ; compare with lhs 1742a and lhs 377 ) .",
    "an immediate consequence is that there should be correspondingly faint red subdwarfs in the field waiting to be discovered , although they will be rare . for every field subdwarf in the range @xmath35",
    ", there should be @xmath36  subdwarfs with @xmath37 , or less than 1 in 30,000 of all stars in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "there is also a small sample of apparent cluster members located between the cooling sequence and the ms , and some are fainter in v than even the least luminous wd detected .",
    "it is possible that these are field objects with proper motions similar to the cluster .",
    "if they are cluster members , they could be low luminosity he wds in binaries with extremely low mass ms stars .",
    "indeed , such objects are predicted to be the remnants of cataclysmic variables currently accreting at very low rates ( townsley & bildsten 2002 ) .",
    "alternatively , these may indicate a range of colors for pop  ii stars near the hydrogen - burning limit , since low mass , low metallicity stars can be quite blue ( saumon _ et al_. 1994 ) .",
    "the derivation of a mf from the lf for m4 is an uncertain procedure because the current theoretical models for low temperature stars of this metallicity do not fit the lower ms very well .",
    "modelling difficulties are due to problems in treating convection and opacity in the optically thin , dense and cool outer atmospheres of these stars where molecules dominate and where non - ideal gas effects are important .",
    "this affects both the color - t@xmath38 relations and the stellar luminosity . at the lowest masses severe problems with calculating",
    "the adiabatic gradient occur with resultant uncertainty in the mass - luminosity relation ( montalban _ et al_. 1999 ) . with these caveats ,",
    "we generated and display the cluster mf in figure  3 using the models of montalban _ et al .",
    "_ to convert luminosities to masses .",
    "the input luminosity function was corrected for incompleteness by inserting in 4 trials a total of 4900 stars with magnitudes from @xmath39 to 31 to each chip . for an artificial star to be considered",
    "recovered it had to be found on at least 3 of the frames ( so that its motion could potentially be determined ) as well as being recovered within 1 magnitude of its input brightness and within 0.5 pixels of its input position .",
    "the resulting mf rises very slowly to low masses , with a formal slope @xmath7 ( @xmath40 , salpeter @xmath41 ) .",
    "a @xmath42 fit finds that slopes of @xmath43  1.05 are acceptable at the 99% confidence level , a tighter constraint will be possible when better lower ms models are available .",
    "there is no evidence that the mf turns over , even to the lowest masses we detect ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "this assertion is more solid than might appear from the uncertain model fitting .",
    "the total number of stars fainter than @xmath45 ( brighter than this the models do fit the data ) is consistent with the expectations based on the extrapolated mf down to @xmath46 , regardless of the m - l relation .",
    "we can also predict the number of ms stars expected to @xmath47 ( the brown dwarf limit for solar metallicity ) . extrapolating",
    "the current mf suggests that we should find 20 more stars redder than @xmath34 .",
    "if the hydrogen - burning limit for m4 is at higher mass , _ e.g. _ at @xmath48 as suggested by the montalban _ et al_. models , this will drop to 8 . within this context",
    "it is of interest to note that we found no stars with i magnitudes in the range 25  27 that possess pmds appropriate for cluster membership and are found solely on the i frames .",
    "the wd population also allows us to constrain the mf slope above the cluster turnoff as discussed in richer _ et al_. 1997 .",
    "the completeness - corrected wd counts are 602 to @xmath49 .",
    "the detected 570 ms stars between @xmath4 and @xmath50 ( upper limit due to saturation ) imply 1219 wds if the slope @xmath51 extends all the way through the turnoff mass ( @xmath52 ) to the expected upper limit for wd progenitor masses ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "thus , we find a factor of two less than expected .",
    "however , if the mf slope is at the steep end of the acceptable range found above , then we predict 584 wds , in agreement with the observed numbers . however , the wd counts are far above that expected if the global m4 imf of pulone _ et al_. 1999 is adopted",
    ". they propose @xmath54 above the turnoff mass which would predict a paltry 264 wds .",
    "furthermore , if m4 has undergone significant mass segregation as they suggest , this number would be even smaller .",
    "if there is a significant fraction of the cluster wd population which possess pure he atmospheres , they will have cooled beyond our detection limit ( hansen 1999 ) and will not be included in the above census . a population comprising 50% of all cluster",
    "wds would allow a continuous power law @xmath55 from @xmath4 to @xmath53 .",
    "hence the constraints from wd counts that can be placed on the ms are dependent upon assumptions about the shape of the mf and the wd fraction with he atmospheres .",
    "however , the fact that all of the observed wds seen can be accounted for with a mf slope of @xmath56 is at least consistent with a simple picture where most wds are h - rich , and where we have indeed seen the termination of the wd cooling sequence in m4 .",
