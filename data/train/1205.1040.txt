    "circumstellar disks are key signposts for planetary system evolution both because they are associated closely with planets , and because they are much more readily observed than the planets themselves .",
    "optically thick protoplanetary disks are born around young stars and dissipate over a time @xmath2 myr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "afterwards , optically thin planetary debris disks can emerge , sustained by the fragmentation of colliding planetesimals @xcite .",
    "debris disks are readily detected through their infrared excess emission ( over the stellar photospheric output ) , which is produced by dust warmed by the star .",
    "such excesses are found over the entire age range of main sequence stars to ages of @xmath3 gyr .",
    "therefore , they can be used to probe the presence and state of planetesimal systems ( such as the analogs of asteroid and kuiper belts ) and , indirectly , the evolution of the accompanying planetary systems . in particular , debris disks can be used to search for phases in the evolution of other planetary systems that played major roles in the evolution of the solar system and in the formation of terrestrial planets .",
    "one such phase extends roughly from 30 to 130 myr , well separated from the era of protoplanetary disks but when dynamical models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) predict that giant impacts will still occur @xcite .",
    "for example , our moon formed during this period through a massive collision between the proto - earth and a mars - sized proto - planet @xcite .",
    "such events should yield huge amounts of debris ; indeed , a few candidates have been found .",
    "they take the form of infrared excesses from heated debris that far exceed those expected from the trend for quiescently evolving systems ( see summary in * ? ? ?",
    "these extreme systems ( defined as total emission @xmath4 four times the stellar photospheric output at 24 @xmath1 ) occur around only @xmath5 of solar - like ( f5-g9 ) stars @xcite . if evolutionary timescales similar to those of conventional debris systems are adopted ( on the order of 3 myr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then the low level of incidence of such excesses implies that major collisions are rare . in this paper , we present _ spitzer _ data that show that two of these extreme systems , in and in the ( both with fractional debris disk luminosities @xmath6 ) , vary significantly at 24 @xmath1 over a few years . the age of ngc 2547 is @xmath735 myr @xcite , while that of the pleiades is @xmath7120 myr @xcite . despite their large and variable infrared excesses , both and are well past the age of protoplanetary disks and the variations we report are unlikely to be related to those found to be ubiquitous in the latter disk type at ages @xmath2 myr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the data for both stars show a scatter of only @xmath13 , consistent with measurement errors and corroborating the lack of variability at visible wavelengths .",
    "wise observations of were performed in mid may , 2010 , nearly 6.5 years after the irac observation .",
    "here we consider only the w1 and w2 bands because of their spectral proximity to the two short wavelength bands in irac .",

    "however , variations in the 3 - 4 @xmath1 region are not seen for over the @xmath71.5 year time span between the irac and wise observations .    in summary",
    ", we found 10% @xmath8 30% peak - to - peak variation at 24 @xmath1 on yearly timescales while no changes were found at optical wavelengths for these two systems .",
    "the change between irac and wise , as well as the irs synthetic photometry , suggests that variations are also possibly seen at 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath1 .",
    "and a few other of extreme - excess stars ( e.g. , , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show spectra in the 10 @xmath1 region ( see figure 1 ) indicative of the presence of finely divided silica dust @xcite or analogs of silica `` smoke '' @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of is also complex , with features indicating significant amounts of finely divided crystalline silicates ( n. gorlova et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the large equivalent widths of the features in these spectra require grain sizes of order 0.1 @xmath1 @xcite , well below the blowout size for these stars .",
    "the dust properties suggest that the infrared excesses of these stars are associated with violent , recent events @xcite and hence may differ significantly from typical planetary debris systems whose mid - infrared spectra tend to be featureless @xcite and whose evolution is dominated by an overall slow monotonic decay with time @xcite .",
    "* several gyr old ) , which also has a very strong emission band around 10 @xmath1 , may also vary by @xmath77% in the wise @xmath18 and @xmath19 bands ( 12 and 22 @xmath1 ) between two scans @xmath7188 days apart , although it is probably stable at @xmath17 , suggesting that the mid - infrared variability might be correlated with the presence very fine dust particles .",
    "traditional planetary debris disks are sustained by collisional cascades in which populations of planetesimals collide until they are ground down to micron - sized dust , when they are ejected by radiation pressure or spiral into the star due to poynting - robertson drag .",
    "the timescale for the overall changes in the infrared excesses in these systems is expected to be millions of years @xcite .",
    "however , around stars of solar mass or less , theoretical models by @xcite indicate that short - term spikes in the 24 @xmath1 output can occur due to large collisions ( of @xmath7100 km bodies ) .",
    "thus , the variations support the arguments that we are seeing the consequences of individual collisional events and the resulting rapid generation of large swarms of particles .",
    "we can estimate the timescales for such events from the scaling relations given by @xcite . to apply these relations",
    ", we need to estimate the location of the planetesimal belts around the two stars . because small grains associated with recent transient events dominate the mid - infrared properties , it is not possible to derive the properties of the parent body planetesimal system from the mid - ir measurements . instead",
    ", we assume that the parent body populations are similar to those around stars of similar spectral type and age .",
    "the infrared excesses at 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath1 trace dust within @xmath71 au of a solar - type star . we have complemented studies of these excesses by @xcite by analyzing the data for the from @xcite . in the latter case , we found that none of the stars with [ 3.6 ] @xmath20 10 ( corresponding to solar - like absolute magnitudes ) have excesses .",
    "the net result is that , in the age range ( 30 - 130 myr ) , there are only two cases other than and with reliably detected excesses at 5.8 @xmath1 and 8.0 @xmath1 out of a total of 352 solar - like stars observed .",
    "this result shows that planetesimal belts in debris systems in this age range are nearly always located outside 1 au . if into equations 14 - 16 of @xcite , we substitute solar masses and luminosities , a fractional luminosity of @xmath21 , a radius of 1 au , @xmath22 of 0.5 , and eccentricity of 0.2 ( values to yield as rapid evolution as possible ) , we find that the time to remove a 100 km diameter body by collisional cascade is @xmath23 years . on the other hand ,",
    "the time to remove 1 mm particles is @xmath24 year , an order of magnitude shorter than the time span of the observations .",
    "this suggests that small particles are replenished by secondary collisions .",
    "given that the variations are @xmath710% of the fractional luminosity , the mass associated with them is @xmath710@xmath25 m@xmath26 , integrating the particle size distribution from 0.1 @xmath27 m to 100 km .",
    "significantly lower mass estimates are only possible if the planetesimal belt is well inside 1 au .",
    "* figure 19 ) present detailed models that find a characteristic timescale of @xmath28 years for the decay of dust from collisions in the asteroid belt .",
    "the behavior is supported by the role of recent collisions in the production of zodiacal dust bands @xcite .",
    "this result provides an independent test of the timescale for decay of excess due to collisional cascades around and . for the population of disks around stars of similar",
    "mass and age to these two , a typical fractional luminosity in a quiescent state is @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "most of this emission is from cool dust that must be well outside a few au from the star .",
    "the fractional luminosity for warm dust is an order of magnitude lower @xcite , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "these values , the scaling relations in @xcite , a solar fractional luminosity of @xmath31 @xcite , and orbital radius of 2.5 au for the zodiacal cloud and asteroid belt indicate @xmath7100 years as the characteristic time for decay of a transient event via collisional cascade at 1 au around or .",
    "this value agrees well with that obtained directly from the scaling relations .",
    "although this estimate is rough , it indicates that generating the variable excesses through collisional cascades may not be impossible , but would require extreme assumptions .",
    "we therefore will explore alternatives .",
    "the possibility that the 24 @xmath1 changes reflect varying rates of heating by the star is made unlikely by the complete lack of variations in the visible for both stars .",
    "phenomena that avoid any kind of collisional cascade will inherently have faster timescales .",
    "one such process might be a collision that caused a large body to lose its regolith , injecting pre - processed small dust into the interplanetary space around the star .",
    "however , very small grains tend to be absent in planetesimal regoliths because radiation pressure slowly drives the small particles away @xcite ; the regolith hypothesis is possibly contradicted by the evidence for small grains in the mid - ir spectra .",
    "in addition , regoliths have a full size spectrum of objects @xcite , so such a regolith ejection event would be analogous to launching a fully developed collisional cascade and it would have a similar evolutionary timescale to the cascades already considered .",
    "an alternative might be the disintegration of one or several extremely large comets .",
    "the most finely divided dust released would have a short dwell time near the star , since it would be ejected by radiation pressure or lost through poynting - robertson drag ; the larger bodies would remain for some time because the comet orbit would not coincide with a dense planetesimal belt and would have inadequate density of objects for vigorous collisional activity .",
    "the timescale for the first process is probably too short , making the resulting excesses too rare to agree with the simultaneous detection of a number of them , and that for the second too long to explain the variability of and .",
    "none of these possibilities can convincingly be shown to produce the huge amounts of dust around these stars while having the necessary short timescales for variability .",
    "therefore , we consider another possibility  that the dust condenses from silica - rich vapor associated with violent collisions among large bodies .",
    "for example , in massive collisions such as the one that formed our moon , of order 20% of the mass emerges as vapor rich in silica @xcite .",
    "the production of silica - rich vapor can occur at collisional velocities above about 2 km s@xmath9 based on simple energetic arguments .",
    "however , a threshold of about 10 km s@xmath9 is generally adopted because a substantial portion of the energy is deposited in collisionally produced fragments @xcite .",
    "laboratory experiments suggest that the vapor will condense quickly into silica `` smoke '' @xcite , and forsterite - like crystals are the most common crystalline form to grow from the condensation products @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of silica smoke @xcite resembles that of the infrared excess of @xcite , while the small grains that dominate the spectrum of are rich in forsterite - like materials ( n. gorlova et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the resulting small particles will be cleared quickly by radiation pressure and the poynting - robertson effect .",
    "the cooling and disk spreading timescale for the silica - rich protolunar disk that later formed the moon is @xmath7one year @xcite .",
    "however , most of the ejected mass in the moon - forming impact remained gravitationally bound to the earth ; the small solid angle viewed from the sun indicates that such a single event could not raise the infrared luminosity high enough to explain the excesses in these systems .",
    "however , the significant amount of escaping material from a major impact might initiate a violent collisional cascade and elevate the infrared excess of the star for a longer period .",
    "thus , the extreme excesses around id8 and hd 23514 are unlikely to be due to an individual violent collision , but to reflect extended episodes of such collisions possibly triggered by a single event .",
    "dynamical models indicate that giant impacts continue to build terrestrial planets into the 30 - 130 myr age range .",
    "a small number of stars have extreme infrared excesses and mid - infrared spectra that suggest that such impacts have occurred recently around them . however , the duration of these indicators , and hence the frequency of events required to account for the numbers we detect , is not clear .",
    "we report that the excess is variable on year - timescales around two of these stars , in and in the ; a third variable example has been reported by @xcite .",
    "the variability is too rapid to be explained readily if the excesses are generated in collisional cascades , as is the case for most planetary debris disks .",
    "instead , it is possible that the dust producing the excess condenses from vapor generated in violent collisions .",
    "the timescale for variations of years , rather than millions of years , suggests that the evolution of the infrared excesses might be rapid . in that case",
    ", major collisions would need to occur frequently to account for the number of stars in this age range that are observed to have extreme excesses .",

    "<S> those with ages between 30 and 130 myr are of interest because their evolution has progressed well beyond that of protoplanetary disks ( which dissipate with a timescale of order 3 myr ) , yet they represent a period when dynamical models suggest that terrestrial planet building may still be progressing through large , violent collisions that could yield large amounts of debris and large infrared excesses . </S>",
    "<S> for example , our moon was formed through a violent collision of two large proto - planets during this age range . </S>",
    "<S> we report two disks around the solar - like stars and in this age range where the 24 @xmath1 infrared excesses vary on timescales of a few years , even though the stars are not variable in the optical . </S>",
    "<S> variations this rapid are difficult to understand if the debris is produced by collisional cascades , as it is for most debris disks . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that the debris in these two systems arises in part from condensates from silicate - rich vapor produced in a series of violent collisions among relatively large bodies . </S>",
    "<S> if their evolution is rapid , the rate of detection of extreme excesses would indicate that major collisions may be relatively common in this age range .    </S>"
