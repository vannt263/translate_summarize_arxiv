    "the development of top - down cosmology has encountered a research hot on studying the superstring landscape for realizing the cosmological inflation .",
    "this involves the search of metastable de sitter - like string vacua at which the ten - dimensional spacetime behaves effectively as having only four dimensions , with six spatial extra dimensions compactified on a calabi - yau threefold and almost all of the compactification moduli including the calabi - yau volume stabilized .",
    "the advent of kklt mechanism@xcite for moduli stabilization has opened lots of possibilities to engineer inflation in string theory , using either the light closed string moduli@xcite or open string moduli@xcite related to the position of a mobile d - brane in wrapped geometry as the relevant scalar fields .",
    "different stringy realization of cosmological inflation may not be mutually incompatible .",
    "they may arise in different regions of the landscape , among which we anticipate that there is at least one possibility that realizes the inflationary evolution of our universe .",
    "the different inflation scenarios may also turn into one another , increasing the overall probability of inflation from a single mechanism@xcite .    in a reasonable inflationary scenario ,",
    "the inflaton field has to be ensured to roll its potential very slowly so that there are enough efoldings for acceleration .",
    "it is necessary that , during the inflation epoch , the potential energy curve of the involved scalars must be sufficiently flat and their effective masses have to be much smaller than the hubble parameter , @xmath4 .",
    "scalar fields such as the brane inter - distances in a general d - brane inflation model are conformally coupled to gravity , which enables them to acquire squared masses @xmath5 ( @xmath6-problem ) . to overcome this @xmath6-problem and have a slow - roll inflation in such a scenario , severe and sometimes unnatural fine - tunings",
    "are indispensable@xcite .",
    "alternatively , no severe @xmath6-problem exists in the closed string moduli inflation scenario@xcite where the inflation is thought of to be driven by some light closed string moduli associated with 4-cycle volumes of the compact calabi - yau threefolds , particularly in the large volume limit@xcite .",
    "the first proposed closed string moduli inflation scenarios in type iib superstring theory are the racetrack inflation model@xcite and the better racetrack inflation model@xcite , where the heavy moduli are stabilized at a supersymmetric anti - de sitter f - term potential minimum and the potential is uplifted to have a de sitter vacuum for inflation in an uncontrollable manner unless some additional ingredients are added to break the supersymmetry spontaneously@xcite . in the subsequent khler inflation model@xcite and roulette inflation model@xcite , the scalar potential for the moduli fields",
    "is calculated in the large volume limit , where the leading @xmath1-correction to the khler potential has been taken into account so that the heavy moduli are stabilized at a supersymmetric broken anti - de sitter f - term potential minimum .",
    "because this anti - de sitter minimum is apart from supersymmetry , it can be uplifted to a de sitter vacuum by taking into account some d - term corrections to the scalar potential@xcite . moreover , after heavy moduli are stabilized in the large volume limit , the scalar potential for the survived light khler moduli are exponentially flat , making such approaches very promising for engineering assisted - like inflation@xcite .    in string theory cosmology scenario , the early evolution of our universe",
    "is essentially drived by multiple scalar fields . when superstring is compactified on a calabi - yau threefold to yield a four - dimensional effective @xmath7 supergravity theory , lots of moduli fields emerge .",
    "it has been conjectured , however , that increasing the number of khler moduli fields does probably make the inflation be easier to achieve@xcite .",
    "moreover , the presence of multiple scalar fields during inflation can lead to quite different inflationary dynamics such as the detectable non - gaussianity in primordial density perturbations on super - hubble scales and residual isocurvature fluctuations after inflation@xcite that might appear unnatural in a single field model .",
    "our aim in the present paper is to build a two - field inflation model from the large volume limit of type iib superstring with 3-form fluxes compactified on a calabi - yau orientifold of @xmath8 and discuss its implications on cobe spectrum of the linear curvature perturbation . for",
    "that we first investigate the possibility of realizing better racetrack inflation in the large volume approach .",
    "we divide the khler moduli into volume modulus , @xmath9 heavy moduli and two light moduli .",
    "the scalar potential is dominated by its f - term contribution , and is corrected by a volume - modulus dependent uplifting .",
    "the axion - dilaton , complex structure moduli and all heavy khler moduli including the volume modulus are stabilized , in the large volume limit , to a de sitter - like minimum of the potential , whereas the two light khler moduli remain dynamical during the moduli stabilization process .",
    "these two light khler moduli are supposed to be the scalar fields driving the inflationary expansion of the 4-dimensional universe .",
    "the de sitter minimum of the dominant potential does not only stabilize the heavy moduli by giving them masses , it governs also the evolution of two survived light moduli .",
    "the exponential dependence of the nonperturbatively corrected superpotential upon the khler moduli guarantees the flatness of the scalar potential for two light khler moduli .",
    "if the axionic components of the light moduli are dynamical , this is a large volume version of the better racetrack model@xcite in which four scalar fields are involved . in the present paper",
    "we choose to stabilize the axionic components at the potential minimum , a two - field assisted - like model@xcite results in instead . in some sense , this is an extension of the single field inflationary model@xcite to two - field case , to which we calculate the linear perturbations in a strict multi - field approach . by assigning some suitable model dependent parameters",
    ", we obtain the cobe normalization favored power spectrum of the linear curvature perturbation , and in particular , @xmath2 at the horizon exit .",
    "dependent upon the trajectory in phase space and thus the initial conditions we choose , the isocurvature perturbation in this model could decay very slowly for most of efolds on superhorizon scales . we have also observed that the power spectrum of curvature perturbation on the super - hubble scales has some remarkable departure from that of adiabatic perturbation at the end of inflation , implying that the curvature fluctuation after inflation does inevitably include significant contributions from isocurvature perturbation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    ", the theoretical setup is introduced .",
    "we review briefly the large volume approach to the moduli stabilization developed by quevedo and his collaborators in @xcite and establish our own two - field model .",
    "the third section is devoted to the investigation of possible inflationary dynamics in our model .",
    "we first present the equations of motion for the background fields and the linear perturbations , and then calculate the power spectra of these perturbations and their correlation by numerical integration .",
    "the obtained curvature power spectrum is nearly flat during most inflation and is characterized by a spectral index @xmath2 at the claimed hubble crossing .",
    "the final section is our conclusions .",
    "inflation in string theory is always associated with the resolvability of the moduli stabilization because the potential used to stabilize the heavy moduli might yield unacceptably large masses for the inflation drivers@xcite . in type iib superstring",
    "compactified on a calabi - yau orientifold , the closed string moduli consist of the complex structure moduli , dilaton field and the khler moduli .",
    "all complex structure moduli including the dilaton field could belong to the heavy moduli and be stabilized at a minimum of the effective potential if we introduce an imaginary self - dual 3-form flux into the orientifold construction@xcite .",
    "the stabilization of the khler moduli requires , according to kklt mechanism@xcite , introducing the nonperturbative contributions of the euclid d3-branes or some wrapped d7-branes to the superpotential , @xmath10 where @xmath11 with @xmath12 the @xmath13-th 4-cycle volume and @xmath14 the corresponding axions .",
    "the coefficients @xmath15 represent threshold corrections and are independent of the khler moduli .",

    "the uplifting correction to the scalar potential , which has several possible sources and is necessary to fine - tune the cosmological constant , depends on moduli only through the overall volume , @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "for concreteness , we assume @xmath26 in the present paper .",
    "it is remarkable that , in the presence of several khler moduli , the variation of scalar potential along each @xmath27 direction is in general uncorrelated with its magnitude . besides , the potential is exponentially flat along some @xmath27 directions as long as these khler moduli are sufficient large .",
    "therefore , the large khler moduli have much chance to become the scalar fields to drive the early inflationary evolution of our universe .    the calabi - yau orientifolds of swiss - cheese type have been shown to be very useful in string inflation engineering , whose volume can be formulated into a simplified form as follows@xcite , @xmath28\\ ] ] here the volume of the @xmath13-th 4-cycle is denoted by @xmath29 , among which @xmath30 controls the overall volume and @xmath31 [ @xmath32 are blow - ups whose only non - vanishing triple intersections are with themselves .",
    "we stabilize the dilaton and complex structure moduli with fluxes , following the plausible kklt procedure@xcite .",
    "after that , the superpotential ( [ eq : 1 ] ) is reduced to be only khler moduli dependent , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and for simplicity @xmath35 is assumed to be real .",
    "we establish our formalism in the large volume limit , where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 for @xmath39 but @xmath40 for @xmath41 and @xmath42 . because @xmath15 in superpotential ( [ eq : 1 ] ) are directly proportional to the squared masses of the corresponding khler moduli , @xmath27 are referred to be the heavy moduli when @xmath43 and light moduli when @xmath44 , respectively . in this limit ,",
    "@xmath45 , the superpotential is approximately independent of @xmath46 which we will call the volume modulus , @xmath47 up to the magnitude of order @xmath48 , we can approximately write the scalar potential as @xmath49 , where the dominant part @xmath50 consists of the contributions of the volume modulus and the heavy moduli , and of the necessary uplifting potential , @xmath51 the contributions of the light khler moduli to the scalar potential do only appear in correction term @xmath52 , @xmath53 in eq.([eq : 8 ] ) , we have parameterized the uplifting potential as @xmath54 , with @xmath55 a positive parameter .",
    "there are terms not included in eqs.([eq : 8 ] ) and ( [ eq : 9 ] ) , which are subleading .    in the large volume approach@xcite , the moduli stabilization problem of the khler moduli is solved in the following two - step procedure@xcite .",
    "first , we stabilize the axions @xmath14 ( @xmath56 ) to the potential minimum by setting @xmath57 .",
    "second , we can find an approximate minimum of the potential by letting @xmath50 be flat along the directions of @xmath58 and the heavy moduli @xmath12 ( @xmath59 ) in moduli space .",

    "phenomenologically , we expect that @xmath65 provides the dominant potential energy for the inflationary evolution of the survived light khler moduli .",

    "the range of @xmath68 at the horizon exit is @xmath69 for typical values of the microscopic parameters .",
    "thus the inflationary energy scale should be rather low in such models , @xmath70@xcite .",
    "this requirement can be easily satisfied by making some fine - tuning on the involved stringy parameters and , in fact , there exists a landscape in parameter space in favor of phenomenology and cosmology .",
    "one possibility that we will focus on in the next section is given by an orientifold model of @xmath71 , with geometrical parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73@xcite .",
    "the complex structure moduli including dilaton are supposed to be fixed by imaginary self - dual 3-form fluxes in such a manner that after these moduli are stabilized we have @xmath74 and consequently @xmath75 .",

    "the large volume approach to heavy khler moduli stabilization naturally provides a platform for having a stringy inflation scenario , where the survived light khler moduli , say @xmath12 for @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) play the roles of the multifield inflation drivers .",

    "the latter is expected to be zero ) .",
    "because in eq.([eq : 12 ] ) @xmath65 is one order of the fixed calabi - yau volume in the magnitude greater than the other scalar field dependent terms , the fixed volume @xmath61 and all of the stabilized heavy khler moduli as well as the associated axions will remain frozen during inflation .",

    "therefore , in the present two - field model , the power spectrum of curvature perturbation on superhorizon scales is changeable with respect to time .",
    "this is in contrast with the single field inflation case where the curvature power spectrum remains approximately a constant after hubble crossing .",

    "we see that for @xmath264 on superhorizon scales the spectrum of curvature perturbation originates almost exclusively from the fluctuations of the initial curvature perturbation along the inflationary trajectory .",
    "while for @xmath158 , the curvature - isocurvature correlation becomes important , the spectrum at the final stage of inflation contains considerable contributions from the interactions with the isocurvature modes . as a result ,",
    "the curvature perturbation spectrum after inflation is slightly higher than the curvature perturbation spectrum at hubble crossing .",
    "the obtained power spectrum of the curvature perturbation in the present two - field model is in good agreement with the cobe normalization of power spectrum@xcite @xmath265 for @xmath264 .",
    "@xmath266 is an instant approximately 55 efoldings before the end of inflation , it is near the cobe normalization point .",

    "it follows from the above numerical investigation that , in the two - field model under consideration , strong interactions exist between the curvature and isocurvature perturbations during the final stage of inflation . because the relative correlation coefficient increases steadily from the assigned tiny value deep inside the hubble radius to values very close to _",
    "one _ at the end of inflation , a great deal curvature perturbation after inflation originates from interactions between the curvature and isocurvature perturbations on super - hubble scales , not only from the quantum fluctuations of the initial curvature perturbation along the classical trajectory . at this point ,",
    "our model is somewhat similar to the double inflation with non - canonical kinetic terms and roulette inflation studied in @xcite .",
    "what distinguishes our model from the double inflation with non - canonical kinetic terms and roulette inflation is that in the former the power spectrum of isocurvature perturbation remains almost a constant during the most of inflationary epoch while in the latter it decays rapidly after the hubble radius crossing .",

    "we have established a multifield inflationary model on the large volume flux compactification scheme in type iib superstring orientifolds of @xmath273 .",
    "the khler moduli are categorized into volume modulus , heavy moduli and light moduli .",
    "almost all of closed string moduli emerging from the flux compactification are frozen at the potential minimum in the spirit of kklt mechanism in the large volume limit . however , this is not the case for light khler moduli .",
    "the light khler moduli have very small masses , they are not fixed by either the 3-form fluxes or nonperturbative effects in the effective superpotential , and could be the driving force for the potential inflationary evolution of the universe in its early history . to have a multifield inflation model ,",
    "the superpotential is expected to contain several exponent terms for the light khler moduli .",
    "hence we have considered the orientifolds of @xmath274 and supposed that in our constructions the number of light khler moduli is equal to or greater than two . in some sense , in this paper we have proposed a plausible generalization of the better racetrack model@xcite in the large volume approach@xcite .",
    "the quantitative analysis of inflationary property in the resulting multifield inflationary model has been done in a simplified two - field model where there are only two light khler moduli with the axionic components being stabilized at the potential minimum also .",
    "this assisted - like model is an extension of the khler moduli inflation model@xcite to two - field inflation , which distinguishes itself by its kinetic lagrangian that is neither of canonical nor non - standard type studied in @xcite .",
    "our investigation consists of two steps .",
    "first , by some inevitable fine tuning in the initial conditions of the scalar fields , we integrate the background equations numerically and obtain the inflationary trajectory of the scalar fields . as a remarkable characteristic of the multifield model ,",
    "the trajectory in field space in our model are strongly bent roughly 50 efolds after the hubble crossing .",
    "the first slow - roll parameter is numerically calculated which turns out to almost vanish for the first 60 efolds , implying that the scalar potential is very flat along the trajectory .",
    "second , we derive the evolution equations of the linear scalar perturbations .",
    "these equations are numerically integrated on which we have calculated the curvature , isocurvature spectra , and the correlation between them .",
    "our numerical estimation for the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation and the corresponding spectral index is in good agreement with the cobe normalization and the wmap observation dataset @xcite . in our model , the correlation between the curvature and isocurvature perturbations is gradually strong on super - hubble scales , so that the curvature spectrum approximately thirty efolds after the hubble exit is remarkably different from the curvature perturbation spectrum at the hubble exit , and there might be significant non - gaussianity in bispectrum and trispectrum of the primordial perturbations .",
