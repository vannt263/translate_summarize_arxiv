    "the relation between the star formation rate ( sfr ) per unit area , @xmath8 , and the gas surface density ( of either molecular or neutral gas ) has been a focal point of many galaxy evolution studies @xcite .",
    "this relation holds over several orders of magnitude in @xmath8 with a relatively small scatter if measured on @xmath9kpc sized patches of galaxies or for whole galaxies . yet , despite these efforts , we still do not quite understand how this correlation comes about and , embarrassingly , what the precise functional form of this relation is .",
    "the reason for the latter is that neither sfrs nor molecular hydrogen ( @xmath2 ) masses are directly accessible in extra - galactic observations .",
    "sfrs are inferred from a combination of ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) observations , in order to capture the energy output of both obscured and unobscured star formation .",
    "cold molecular gas is measured indirectly from emission lines of tracer molecules , such as carbon monoxide ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "while observational studies of nearby galaxies and galaxies out to @xmath10 seem to show that the relation between @xmath8 and @xmath11 is close to linear @xcite , there is no clear theoretical understanding why this is so and , furthermore , there is the concern that systematics in the observables bias these results . for instance",
    ", it has been suggested that the star formation  gas relation is super - linear with a power - law exponent of @xmath12 on kpc scales , but that ir emission unrelated to recent star formation reduces the inferred slope , see @xcite , but cf .",
    "@xcite . alternatively ,",
    "systematic variation of the @xmath13 conversion factor with @xmath1 intensity , sfrs , or gas surface density could potentially disguise a highly super - linear relation and make it appear linear @xcite , cf .",
    "finally , the fitting itself has been targeted as a potential source of bias . a bayesian re - analysis of the data presented by @xcite results in tentative evidence that the star formation  gas relation is mildly _ sub_-linear and shows substantial variations from one galaxy to the next @xcite .",
    "theoretical explanations of the star formation  gas connection predict a variety of non - linear relationships , see e.g. , @xcite . for instance",
    ", @xcite estimate that the power - law exponent is mildly non - linear ( @xmath14 ) at high gas surface densities ( @xmath15 @xmath16 pc@xmath17 ) , while @xcite predict a much steeper , quadratic relation at such gas surface densities .",
    "this gas surface density regime is clearly highly relevant because it corresponds to typical gas surface densities of star forming galaxies at @xmath18 and higher ( e.g. , @xcite , see also section [ sect : csfh ] ) . a significantly super - linear star formation ",
    "gas relation has also been suggested by recent work based on ( non - cosmological ) galaxy evolution simulations that include a @xmath9pc - scale modeling of various stellar feedback channels @xcite .    in this paper",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sect : model ] we describe the analytic model which underlies our predictions and present the star formation  gas relations that enter our analysis . in section [ sect : funcform ] we first demonstrate that the model reproduces the observed stellar mass  metallicity relation , the stellar mass  halo mass relation , and the gas - to - stellar mass ratios of galaxies reasonably well _ if _ a linear star formation  gas relation is chosen .",
    "we show that predictions based on a strongly super - linear star formation ",
    "gas relation are in conflict with observations",
    ". we then present how the cosmic star formation history is affected by the functional form of the star formation  gas relation .",
    "potential caveats of our approach are discussed in section [ sect : caveats ] . in section [",
    "sect : driver ] we put our findings in a broader context , showing that galaxy evolution can be thought of as an evolution along a line of equilibrium points driven by the cosmic modulation of the accretion rate .",
    "we summarize our findings in section [ sect : summary ] and close the paper with a comparison to previous work .",
    "the analytic model that is used in the remainder of the paper follows closely the approach presented by @xcite and @xcite . at its most basic level",
    "the model tracks the average evolution of the dark matter , gas , and stellar content of halos using theoretically or observationally motivated accretion and transformation rates for the different mass components . for the convenience of the reader we begin by summarizing the main equations that enter the model and refer the reader to @xcite for more details .",
    "we then discuss the various star formation models that we explore in this work and conclude the section with a short descriptions of the actual set - up of the model . in the following ,",
    "we adopt cosmological parameters consistent with wmap 7-year data @xcite : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .      _",

    ", @xmath35 is the press - schechter mass at the given redshift , see @xcite .",

    "the model provides us directly with the gas fraction of a halo of a given mass and we then calculate @xmath31 as the accretion - weighted mean gas fraction ( in units of @xmath32 ) of all accreted halos plus an additional non - halo contribution of 20% .    _",
    "evolution of the gas and stellar mass : _ besides accretion , the baryonic components are subject to additional physical processes , such as star formation , stellar mass loss , and galactic outflows which we consider next .",

    "we follow @xcite and assume @xmath46 , i.e. , a gas outflow rate equal to the sfr , based on the estimates by @xcite .",
    "we discuss the impact of varying this and other model parameters in section [ sect : caveats ] .    _ the gas disk : _ for the modeling of the star formation ( see below ) we need to know how the gas is distributed in the galaxy .",
    "we make the ansatz that the gas forms an exponential disk , see e.g. , @xcite , @xmath47 we assume that the scale radius @xmath48 is set by the initial , pre - collapse angular momentum of the gas @xcite .",

    "the total metal production rate is proportional to both the yield @xmath64 of the stellar population and the star formation rate , i.e. , @xmath65 .",
    "metals that are locked in stellar remnants do not contribute to the metallicity of the ism , which therefore evolves according to @xmath66 . as suggested by @xcite",
    "we add three processes to the basic picture .",
    "first , a fraction @xmath67 of the newly produced metals ( predominantly in a hot , shocked phase ) is removed from small halos by supernovae driven outflows .",
    "second , cold and warm gas of the ism and the associated metals are lost by galactic winds at a rate @xmath68 .",
    "third , inflows from the igm add metals at the rate @xmath69 . hence , the total metal mass of a galaxy changes according to      a single pair instability supernova can enrich halos at high redshifts to metallicities @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "we therefore adopt the value @xmath71 as the metallicity of both the initial gas and the gas accreted onto halos .",
    "* we added a mass threshold below which gas accretion is quenched due to photo - ionization . * the metallicity evolution of the ism ( equation [ eq : dotmz ] ) accounts for the locking - up of metals in stellar remnants .",
    "mathematically this amounts to replacing @xmath45 in equation 23 of @xcite with @xmath72 and , hence , is equivalent to a change of the parameter @xmath45 .",
    "we show in section [ sect : caveats ] that varying @xmath45 by a factor of a few does not strongly affect the sfrds at @xmath73 .",
    "* we use a variety of different star formation  gas relations ( see next section ) .",
    "we calculate the sfr of a galaxy by converting a gas surface density ( either the total gas or the @xmath2 surface density ) into a sfr surface density with the help of an empirically motivated or theoretically derived star formation  gas relation .",
    "the sfr of a galaxy is then simply the integral of the sfr surface density over the area of the gas disk of the galaxy .    a variety of star formation ",
    "gas relations have been suggested based on theoretical modeling and/or observations .",
    "the relationship often takes the form of a power - law with an exponent that ranges from approximately 1 ( linear ) to 2 ( quadratic ) . in this paper",
    "we primarily focus on these two limiting cases for the following reasons .",
    "first , it allows us to extract more easily the systematic variations of galaxy properties resulting from the change of the star formation  gas relation .",
    "second , relations that fall between the two limiting cases do not add anything qualitatively new , but rather result in intermediate predictions for galaxy properties .",
    "hence , much can be learned already from a study of the extreme cases . finally ,",
    "both a linear and a quadratic star formation  gas relation are supported by various lines of evidence .",
    "it is thus clearly of high interest to test their specific implications for the evolution of galaxy properties .",
    "an approximately linear relation is empirically motivated by observational studies of the @xmath74 relation in the local universe @xcite and out to , at least , @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "the depletion time in nearby galaxies is @xmath76 gyr @xcite , but whether this is also true at high redshift is not so clear , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "high redshift samples typically include only galaxies with large star formation rates and gas masses , and , hence , in case of a slightly super - linear star formation ",
    "gas relation it is difficult to distinguish a change in the depletion time with redshift from a change in depletion time due to the increase in gas surface density .",
    "uncertainties related to the @xmath13 conversion factor and the limited spatial resolution of @xmath1 observations further complicate an accurate measurement of the depletion time at high redshift .    our default star formation ",
    "gas relation is thus a _ linear relation _ with a constant molecular depletion time of 2.5 gyr @xcite : @xmath77 the star formation  gas relation is assumed to hold at all redshifts and for all galaxies .",
    "some galaxies may not follow this relation , e.g. , massively starbursting galaxies that lie above the so - called main sequence of star formation , but their contribution to the cosmic star formation budget is estimated to be limited ( @xmath78 or less , see e.g. , @xcite ) .    a quadratic star formation ",
    "gas has been proposed based on analytic and numerical models of feedback - regulated star formation , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "typically the quadratic relationship is expected to hold only at sufficiently high gas surface densities ( @xmath79 @xmath16 pc@xmath17 ) , because at lower surface densities the star formation ",
    "gas relation reduces to effectively counting the number of molecular clouds in a beam and , hence , should still follow a linear relation . some theoretical studies that aim at constraining the conversion factor between @xmath1 emission and @xmath2 surface density also support the idea of an intrinsically quadratic star formation  gas relation ( @xcite , but cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",

    "gas relation are effectively indistinguishable from the predictions of a relation that extends the quadratic relationship to @xmath83 , because surface densities of star forming galaxies at high redshift typically exceed @xmath84 , see section [ sect : csfh ] . in the remainder of this paper",
