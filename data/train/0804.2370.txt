    "<S> the dihadron spectra in high energy @xmath0 collisions are studied within the nlo pqcd parton model with jet quenching taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the high @xmath1 dihadron spectra are found to be contributed not only by jet pairs close and tangential to the surface of the dense matter but also by punching - through jets survived at the center while the single hadron high @xmath1 spectra are only dominated by surface emission . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the suppression factor of such high-@xmath1 hadron pairs is found to be more sensitive to the initial gluon density than the single hadron suppression factor .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most exciting phenomena observed@xcite at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is jet quenching@xcite  a hard probe of a strongly - interacting quark gluon plasma in high energy heavy ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the observed suppression of large @xmath1 hadron spectrum is caused by the total parton energy loss which is related to the average gluon density along the jet propagation path and the total propagation length@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , measurements of large @xmath1 hadron suppression can be directly related to the averaged gluon density . here </S>",
    "<S> we will employ a nlo pqcd parton model@xcite to study the suppression of both single and dihadron spectra due to jet quenching . </S>",
    "<S> different from the previous lo study@xcite , because the number ratio of gluon / quark jets is larger in nlo than in lo calculation and the energy loss of a gluon jet is assumed to be 9/4 larger than that of a quark jet , nlo contribution will behave with stronger quenching effect than lo contribution ( see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> in particular , we will check the robustness of back - to - back dihadron spectra as a probe of the initial gluon density when single hadron spectra supression become fragile@xcite .    within a nlo pqcd parton model @xcite , large @xmath1 particle production cross section in @xmath4 collisions </S>",
    "<S> can be expressed as a convolution of nlo parton - parton scattering cross sections , parton distributions inside the collided nucleons and parton fragmentation functions ( ff ) . in order to study large @xmath1 particle production in @xmath5 collisions </S>",
    "<S> , one can extrapolate @xmath4 cross section to @xmath5 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of jet quenching in @xmath5 collisions is incorporated via the modified jet fragmentation functions due to radiative parton energy loss in dense medium @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the modified jet fragmentation functions are in turn characterized by the average radiative parton energy loss which is proportional to the initial gluon density . </S>",
    "<S> an energy loss parameter @xmath6 @xcite is introduced in following numerical calculations , which is proportional to the initial gluon density @xmath7 .     the single @xmath8 spectra ( left ) in @xmath9 and in central @xmath10 collisions , and the nuclear modification factors ( right ) . </S>",

    "<S> the dihadron suppression factor in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : daaiaa ] is given by @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> for single hadron case , because of jet quenching , the dominant contribution to the measured hadron spectra at large @xmath1 comes from those jets that are initially produced in the outer corona of the overlap region toward the direction of the detected ( or triggered ) hadron s momentum . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly illustrated in the left plot of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : contourplot ] by the spatial distribution of the produced jets that have survived the interaction with the medium and whose leading hadrons contribute to the measured spectra . as pointed out in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , when the initial gluon density is increased such that jets produced in the inner part of the overlapped region are completely suppressed , the final large @xmath1 hadron production is dominated by `` surface emission '' . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the suppression factor for single hadron spectra should never saturate but continue to decrease with the initial gluon density as shown in the left plot of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the data are from ref.@xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ] -.15 in    fortrunately , in adjusting the energy loss parameter @xmath6 or the initial gluon density @xmath7 to fit the suppression factors for both single hadron spectra and dihadron spectra , we find that dihadron spectra is much more sensitive to @xmath6 than the single hadron spectra in the region @xmath24 gev as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> one can understand this increased sensitivity of dihadron spectra in the spatial distribution of the dijet production that survived interaction with the medium and contributed to the measured dihadron , as shown in the right plot of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : contourplot ] . because of trigger bias , </S>",
    "<S> most of the contribution comes from dijets close and tangential to the surface of the overlapped region . however , there are still about 25% of the contribution coming from dijets near the center of the overlapped region . </S>",
    "<S> these jets are truely `` punching '' through the medium and survived the energy loss . </S>",
    "<S> as one further increases the initial gluon density , the fraction of these punch - through jets will also vanish and the final dihadron spectra will be dominated by the tangential jets in the outer corona . as shown in the left plot of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : raaiaa ] , the dihadron suppression factor @xmath23 becomes identical to the single hadron @xmath22 and lose its sensitivity to the initial gluon density of the medium , as would be the case with @xmath25=8gev at the lhc energy . </S>",

    "<S> is in the right plot of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : raaiaa ] that a robust @xmath23 is again obtained while the @xmath22 becomes more fragile if the single and dihadron spectra at much higher @xmath25 ( for example , @xmath25=20gev ) are measured in lhc .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have used nlo pqcd parton model with effective modified fragmentation functions due to radiative parton energy loss to study the fragility of both single and dihadron spectra as probes of the initial gluon density in high - energy heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> numerical analysis shows nlo contribution behaves with stronger quenching effect than lo contribution . </S>",
    "<S> especially , we find the high @xmath1 dihadron spectra are contributed not only by jet pairs close and tangential to the surface of the dense matter but also by substantial punching - through jets survived at the center of the dense matter while the single hadron high @xmath1 spectra are only dominated by surface emission . </S>",
