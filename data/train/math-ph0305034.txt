    "in two recent works we obtained analytical expressions for the solid angle subtended by a cylindrical shaped detector at a point cosine source in the cases where the source axis is orthogonal @xcite or parallel prata2003c to the cylinder axis of revolution . as ancillary results we also derived expressions for the solid angle defined by a circular disc in the cases where the source axis is orthogonal ( @xmath4 ) or parallel ( @xmath5 ) to the symmetry axis of the disc . this latter result ( @xmath5 ) appeared in a previous work by hubbell _",

    "is given in terms of a legendre expansion and @xmath5 appears as a subsidiary result which is interpreted as the response of a plane detector parallel to a lambertian uniformly distributed disc source .",
    "circular apertures and sources are often considered in optics and radiation physics ; and disc - shaped detectors are widely used in nuclear science ( e.g. neutron activation analysis ) .",
    "references to other works on this subject in the context of nuclear physics can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "while the case of a point isotropic source has been treated to great extent jaff54,mack56,mask56,mask57,gard71,prata2003b , the case of a point cosine source has , to the best of our knowledge , attracted little attention , with the already mentioned exception of @xcite . for these reasons , in the present work",
    "we extend the scope of the previous results by performing the calculation of the solid angle defined by a circular disc and a point cosine source pointing at an arbitrary direction , under the sole restriction that the disc lies in the half - space illuminated by the source .",
    "the solid angle subtended by a given surface at a point source located at the origin can be defined by    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the source angular distribution . in the case of a point cosine",
    "the distribution is defined in relation to some direction axis specified by the unit vector @xmath8 and it is given by @xmath9 , the @xmath10 factor ensuring that @xmath11 .",
    "for @xmath12 it follows that @xmath13 so that the source only emits into the hemisphere around @xmath8 . because of this , the integration limits in the rhs of eq .",
    "[ eq_omega_surf1 ] are to be determined from the conditions that @xmath14 and that each included @xmath15 direction hits the surface . in the following",
    "we shall assume that the position of the disc is always chosen is such a manner that @xmath16 for each point on the disc .",
    "this restriction greatly simplifies the calculation without , we believe , reducing the practical interest of the expressions .",
    "this is so because , in actual situations , the source is distributed over some planar surface ; the source axis is coincident with the normal to the surface and then the restriction simply requires that the detector be held somewhere on the illuminated side of the radiating surface or eventually directly on the surface but does not intersect it .",
    "to proceed it is advantageous to consider two coordinate systems ( s and s ) with a common origin also coincident with the source position . in the s system ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) the @xmath17 axis is aligned with the source direction @xmath8 ; the position of the disc center ( c ) is specified by @xmath18 and @xmath19 ; and the symmetry axis of the disc is specified by the angles @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 being the angle between the source and the disc axes . when working in the s system ( fig . [ fig2 ] ) , the @xmath2 axis is parallel to the disc axis , c is located by means of @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; and @xmath25 is given by angles @xmath22 and @xmath26 . due to the symmetry of the source it is possible to choose the @xmath27 axes so that the @xmath28 coordinate of c is zero in each coordinate system . also from the symmetry of the source",
    "it is clear that the solid angle is an even function of @xmath26 or @xmath21 and in the following calculations we will thus assume that @xmath29 and @xmath30 . finally , it is sufficient to consider @xmath31 .",
    "the restriction that @xmath14 over the whole disc is easily expressed in s by @xmath32 @xmath33 being the disc radius .",
    "this is automatically satisfied , provided @xmath34 , but otherwise , it further reduces the range of variation of @xmath35 to    @xmath36    it is readily found that the coordinates of a point in s and s ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) are related by an orthogonal matrix ( @xmath39 ) :    @xmath40    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is given by @xmath43    and its inverse is given by the transpose @xmath44    let @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the coordinates of the disk center in s and s , respectively .",
