    "two - dimensional quantum gravity(2dqg ) is interesting from the point of view of string theory in non - critical or critical dimensions and the statistical mechanics of random surfaces . as has been known the matrix model and the continuous theory , _",
    "i.e. _ the liouville field theory , exhibit the same critical exponent and green s function .",
    "however , the mutual relation between dt and the liouville theory has not been so evident , because the dt surfaces are known to be fractal and its typical fractal dimension is considered to be four . on the other hand , we will show in this paper , the complex structure is well defined even for the dt surfaces , and we can check a precise equivalence of the dt and the liouville theory .    it is known that 2dqg can be interpreted as a special case of the critical string with the conformal mode having a linear dilaton background . the critical string is defined to have two local symmetries , @xmath0 the local scale(weyl ) invariance and the reparametrization(@xmath3 ) invariance . after imposing these two symmetries on the world - sheet , no degree of freedom",
    "is left for the metric @xmath4 except for a set of parameters @xmath5 , which specify the moduli space @xmath6 of the complex structure : @xmath7 therefore , if we find a way to impose the local scale invariance on dt , we achieve a step closer to the study of the numerical simulations of the critical string , although it is not very easy at the present stage .",
    "however , considering the complex structure is very useful for obtaining clear signals in various measurements because the complex structure can be extracted independently to the rather complicated fluctuations of the conformal mode . in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "we have established how to define and measure the complex structure and the conformal mode on the dt surfaces with @xmath8 topology . to be concrete",
    "we focus on the case of torus @xmath9 in this study , but the generalization would be straightforward .",
    "in the continuous formulation the period @xmath5 is obtained by the following procedure .",
    "first we introduce harmonic @xmath10-form @xmath11 where @xmath12 satisfies the divergence and rotation free conditions @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively , with @xmath15 .",
    "since there are two linearly independent solutions , we can impose two conditions such as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent two independent paths on the torus which intersect each other only once and @xmath19 denotes the resistivity of the surface . under these conditions the period @xmath5 is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the dual of @xmath12 defined by @xmath22 .",
    "this procedure can be easily translated to the case of triangulated surfaces by identifying @xmath12 with the current on the resistor network of the dual graph .",
    "then @xmath23 and @xmath24 correspond to the potential drop along @xmath17-cycle and the total current flowing across @xmath17-cycle respectively .",
    "we can easily impose two conditions eq.([eq : pot_cond ] ) by inserting electric batteries in the dual links crossing the @xmath17-cycle and apply constant voltages(1v ) , see fig.[fig : net_current ] .",
    "writing the electric potential at the vertex @xmath25 as @xmath26 and assuming that each bond has resistance @xmath27 , the current conservation reads @xmath28 where @xmath29 represents the voltages of the batteries placed along the @xmath17-cycle and @xmath30 are the three neighboring vertices of @xmath25 .",
    "we solve these set of equations iteratively by the successive over - relaxation method , and estimate the total currents flowing across the @xmath17- and @xmath18-cycles as @xmath31 respectively , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the potentials of vertices placed at either side of the @xmath17- or @xmath18-cycle . in the case of @xmath9 topology the resistivity is not easily determined because of the lack of the @xmath34-invariance as we have made use of in the @xmath8 topology case@xcite .",
    "here , we borrow the resistivities obtained in case of the @xmath8 topology in order to determine the moduli of the torus . here",
    ", we present the theoretical predictions of the distribution function of the moduli .",
    "the genus - one partition function with c scalar fields is given by @xcite by @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath5 is a moduli parameter @xmath37 , and @xmath38 denotes the fundamental region . according to the integrand of eq.([eq : z_torus ] ) , we find that the density distribution function of @xmath5 in the fundamental region is given by up to an overall numerical factor @xmath39 the distribution of @xmath40 for @xmath41 . ] indicates the instability of the vacuum due to the tachyon of the bosonic string theory .",
    "it may become a clear evidence for the branched polymers .",
    "fig.[fig : moduli_dist_16k ] shows the distribution of the period @xmath5 for a surface with @xmath42k triangles in the case of the pure gravity with about @xmath43 independent configurations .    roughly speaking larger values of @xmath40 in the fundamental region",
    "represent tori deformed like a long thin tube , while smaller values of @xmath40 represent almost regular tori . in order to compare numerical results with the predictions of the liouville theory eq.([eq : moduli_integrand ] ) , we consider the distribution functions integrated over @xmath44 .",
    "fig.[fig : hist_comp_pure ] shows the density distributions of @xmath40 in the case of the pure - gravity with @xmath2k , @xmath45k , @xmath46k and @xmath42k triangles .",
    "fig.[fig : moduli_comp_1s ] shows the distributions of @xmath40 in the case of surfaces coupled with a scalar field(@xmath47 ) with @xmath45k , @xmath46k and @xmath42k triangles .",
    "it is clear that the numerical results agree fairly well with the predictions of the liouville theory for sufficiently large number of triangles .",
    "fig.[fig : moduli_comp_2s ] shows the distributions of @xmath40 in the case of two scalar fields(@xmath48 ) with @xmath45k , @xmath46k and @xmath42k triangles . in this case",
    ", we can not detect the divergence of the distribution of @xmath40 .",
    "it would be hard to obtain a large value of @xmath40 for relatively small number of triangles , because we need many triangles to form a long narrow shape to the torus .",
    "we conclude that the dt surfaces have the same complex structure as the liouville theory in the thermodynamic limit for @xmath49 cases .",
    "we are grateful to j.kamoshita for useful discussions and comments.one of the authors(n.t ) was supported by a research fellowships of the japan society for the promotion of science for young scientists ."
