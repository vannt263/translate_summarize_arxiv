    "in our everyday experience almost all the physical phenomena satisfy the laws of the classical physics . however , at the microscopic scale the physical world follows the rules of quantum physics .",
    "the description of quantum physics is different from its classical counterpart both conceptually as well as mathematically @xcite .",
    "this raises the question of quantum to classical transition , i.e. , when and how do the systems stop behaving quantum mechanically and begin to behave classically ?",
    "several novel ideas , like collapse models @xcite , concept of decoherence @xcite _ etc _ have been introduced long back to address these questions .",
    "more recently , in a conceptually different approach , it has been shown that under coarse - grained measurements , classical world arises out of quantum physics @xcite .",
    "all these studies result into a general dictum that in the macroscopic level , the non - classical behaviors of quantum theory or any physical theory ( possibly post quantum ) should subside , and consequently classicality should emerge .",
    "aim of this paper is to study the emergence of such classical behavior in terms of strength of correlations for generalized no - signaling theories and identify some of the generalized no - signaling correlations as _",
    "unphysical_.    one of the most fundamental contradictions of quantum mechanics ( qm ) with classical physics is its nonlocal behavior as established by j. s. bell in his 1964 seminal work @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "whereas all correlations in the classical world are _ local - realistic _ , correlations obtained from multipartite entangled quantum systems may violate empirically testable local realistic inequality ( called ` bell type inequalities ' in general ) which establishes that such quantum correlations do not allow a _ local realistic _ explanation .",
    "quantum nonlocality does not contradict the relativistic causality principle , or more generally the no - signaling principle .",
    "moreover , qm is not the only possible theory that exhibits nonlocality along with satisfying the no - signaling principle ; there can be non - quantum no - signaling correlations exhibiting nonlocality .",
    "one extreme example of such a correlation ( more nonlocal than qm ) was first constructed by popescu and rohrlich ( pr ) @xcite .",
    "whereas the pr correlation violates the bell  clauser  horne - shimony  holt ( bell - chsh ) @xcite inequality by algebraic maximum , the optimal bell - chsh violation in quantum theory is restricted by the tsirelson s bound @xcite .",
    "this raises another important questions : which nonlocal correlations are physical ?",
    "this question is also important from practical perspective since nonlocality has been proved to be important resource in numerous applications @xcite .",
    "an endeavor to answer this question was initiated by w. van dam who showed that existence of super - strong nonlocal correlations [ eg .",
    "pr correlation ] would trivialize the problem of communication complexity @xcite . it may be noted that principles like information causality ( ic ) @xcite or macroscopic locality ( ml ) @xcite do help us towards understanding physicality of some of the post - quantum correlations .",
    "apart from these other conceptually different proposals have been introduced to single out the tsirelson s bound @xcite .",
    "but , till date , identifying the boundary between quantum correlations and post - quantum ones is not done completely and it remains an active area of research ( see @xcite ) .",
    "here we aim at approaching this problem using a macroscopic measurement scheme different from the one used in ml .    in order to study macroscopic properties of a correlation",
    ", one must take a measurement scheme on many copies of the correlation where the identity of individual particles involved in the correlation should not be revealed @xcite .",
    "a practically relevant scheme for studying such macroscopicity of correlations is to consider a case when the identity of the individual particles in the correlations gets lost during the distribution of the correlated state .",
    "one can of course interact microscopically with particles in the correlation , but in general , it is difficult to address them individually @xcite .",
    "so whatever microscopic interaction one intend to use , it will affect , in general , all the particles of the beam at the same time . in this context ,",
    "_ have studied the violation of bell inequalities of entangled states considering a general multipair scenario @xcite .",
    "they have shown that the nonlocality of the quantum entangled state decreases in this multipair scenario with the increase in the number of independent entangled pairs , i.e. , in the macroscopic limit of having infinitely many copies of entangled pairs , one can not get nonlocal correlation .",
    "this observation is compatible with the general dictum that classicality emerges in the macroscopic level .    here ,",
    "in the simplest scenario , i.e. , two parties , each performing one of the two possible measurements , and each measurement having the two possible outcomes ( i.e. @xmath1 scenario ) , we consider the same approach as that of bancal _ et al .",
    "but instead of considering only correlations in entangled quantum states , we contemplate general correlations that may be stronger than quantum ones in exhibiting nonlocal behavior , yet weak enough to prohibit instantaneous signaling .",
    "we characterize _ all _ such correlations , which , in the macroscopic limit , display classicality that is considered- in our context- to be the _ local realistic _ behavior of the correlations .",
    "it is worth mentioning that such classical behavior of any correlation at macroscopic is not sufficient to certify the correlation to be perceived in some physical theory , it is rather a necessary criterion .",
    "we find examples of such correlations that in the macroscopic level behave classically but do not fulfill other necessary criteria , like _ nonlocality distillation _",
    "@xcite or ic @xcite , and hence cease to be considered as physical correlations .",
    "interestingly , on the other hand , we find examples of correlations that indeed satisfy the necessary criteria of ic but at the macroscopic scale exhibit strong nonlocal behavior , going against our general dictum , and hence fail to be considered as physical correlations .    at this point",
    "it is important to note that ml principle @xcite can also identify unphysical correlations .",
    "however our approach is different from that of ml . in ml ,",
    "one also consider beams of correlated particles ( @xmath2 in number which is much greater than @xmath3 , i. e. in the thermodynamic limit ) and to make a relationship with classical physics these beams are assumed to be continuous fields .",
    "in other words , the detectors in alice s and bob s can only perform coarse - graining measurements , i.e. , these detectors can not resolve the beams to their constituent particles ( also , this implies that , they can not perform different measurements on different particles , they are eligible to perform same interactions on the whole beam ) .",
    "hence , the resolution of their detectors should not be perfect , and such a poor resolution can only provide the information about the mean value .",
    "the detectors work in such a precision that one could observe the deviations of intensity fluctuations from the mean value of the order @xmath4 , because in that case the resultant distributions will be described by classical physics .",
    "on the other hand , very recently rohrlich showed that , at the macroscopic scale , pr - box correlations violate relativistic causality and hence has no realization in the classical world @xcite .",
    "moreover , this result has been generalized to all stronger - than - quantum bipartite correlations , constituting a derivation of tsirelson s bound without assuming quantum mechanics @xcite . while in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors showed unphysicality of stronger than quantum correlation via showing signaling of those correlations in the macroscopic limit , we do the same , but , via distillation of non - locality in the macroscopic limit , and therefore our approach is completely different from that adopted in @xcite . furthermore in our approach",
    "some of the correlations having weaker nonlocality than the optimal quantum nonlocality ( in the sense that bell - chsh violation is strictly less than tsirelson s bound ) turns out to be unphysical .    organization of our paper goes as follows : in section-([setup ] ) we discuss the setup to study a general bipartite correlation in single - pair as well as in multipair scenario ; in section-([result ] ) we present our results and section-([comparison ] ) contains comparative discussion between our procedure and other methods ; lastly we present our conclusion in section-([conclusion ] ) .",

    "alice ( bob ) can have one of the following two interactions denoted by @xmath11 @xmath12 with her ( his ) particle .",
    "each interaction results in alice s ( bob s ) particle to follow one of the two possible paths , called outcomes and let us denote it by @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) with @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , and eventually will impinge on one of alice s ( bob s ) two detectors @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) [ see fig.[fig0 ] ] . repeating this experiment",

    "the positivity , normalization and non - signaling constraints lead to this correlation vector to be a point of an eight dimensional polytope @xcite , called no - signaling polytope @xmath22 .",

    "since information about ordering between alice s and bob s particles is lost during their transmission , so they address the beams of particles as a whole .",

    "for this purpose , alice and bob must transform their data , into a binary input - output correlation which we denote in bold letters , i.e. , @xmath73 where @xmath74 . here the interactions by alice and bob are denoted by bold letters @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively , which imply that they apply the same interaction @xmath25 or @xmath77 on each particle of the incoming beam of particles . and",
    "one can get binary outputs by invoking any of the following voting procedures : ( a ) majority voting , ( b ) unanimous voting , or ( c ) any intermediate possibility . according to ` majority voting ' if the number of particles collected in the detector @xmath63 , i.e. , @xmath62 is greater than or equal to the number of particles collected in the detector @xmath64 then the outcome will be denoted as @xmath78 , otherwise the outcome will be denoted as @xmath79 : @xmath80 thus from @xmath2 independent identical pair of correlations majority voting gives a binary input - output probability distribution @xmath73 . instead of majority voting one",

    "it has been shown in @xcite ( see @xcite for experiments that consider majority voting ) that the majority voting yields the largest violation and we also checked that the pr - correlation sustains its nonlocal behaviour in the macroscopic limit under majority voting while it becomes local under other voting protocols .",
    "for this reason , we consider here the majority voting for our study .",
    "in fact , if a ns correlation turns out to be non - local in the macroscopic limit under any one of the aforesaid voting procedures ( or , even by using some other counting method in the macroscopic scenario ) , it will be enough  according to the notion of macro - realism  to discard such a correlation as a physical one .",

    ". the necessary condition of ic thus implies , @xmath219 i.e. , the probability distributions belonging to the class - v of subsection-[3c ] will satisfy the necessary condition of ic as long as the function @xmath220 is not positive . since the bell - chsh expression for the probability distributions belonging to the class - v is @xmath221 , they violate the tsirelson s bound if @xmath222 and hence are not quantum .",
    "so we are interested in the range @xmath223 .",
    "now letting @xmath224 ( clearly @xmath225 ) and using the probability normalization condition , i.e. , @xmath226 , we get @xmath227 we plot the function @xmath228 in fig.[fig6 ] which shows that , in our interested ranges of parameter @xmath229 ( _ i.e _ @xmath223 ) , there exist correlations which satisfy the necessary condition of ic . therefore the necessary condition of ic fails to identify those correlations as unphysical .",
    "however , our earlier analysis points them out as unphysical one since these correlations show extreme non local behaviour ( i.e bell - chsh value @xmath205 ) and hence fail to exhibit the expected classical feature ( i.e. the local behaviour of the correlation ) in the macroscopic limit even though , at single - copy level they do not violate the tirelson s bound .",
    "identifying the set of all quantum correlations is a very important problem in the research area of quantum foundation .",
    "this also has practical relevance since nonlocal correlations are resources for various device - independent tasks . in the last few years ,",
    "different approaches , based on information theoretic or physical principles , have been proposed to identify the quantum correlations @xcite .",
    "whereas in @xcite , the authors introduced an information theoretic principle , namely ic , in @xcite the authors introduced a physical principle , namely ml . in this paper",
    "we take a different approach which is closer to the second one . whereas according to ml",
    ", the coarse - grained extensive observations of macroscopic sources of @xmath2 independent particle pairs should admit a local hidden variable model in the limit @xmath230 , we have considered the majority voting approach ( like @xcite ) to get a new probability distribution from @xmath2 independent particle pairs and demand that in the limit @xmath230 this new correlation should behave locally . for the simplest scenario ( @xmath231 case )",
    "we show how one can characterize which correlations become local and which are not .",
    "correlations exhibiting nonlocal behavior in large @xmath2 limit are sure to be unphysical .",
    "we also find that for some set of correlations , our method is better than the necessary criterion of the ic principle in identifying them as unphysical ones .",
    "moreover our approach identifies some no - signaling correlations each of which does satisfy the tsirelson s bound _ non - maximally _ , but gives rise to maximum non - locality in the macroscopic measurement setup . as a future work it will be interesting to extend this study for more general input - output correlations rather than just @xmath1 scenario .",
