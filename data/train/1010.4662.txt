    "the central role of _ partial classical _ ( boolean ) _ structures _ in quantum mechanics ( qm ) has been recognized by many authors , both for their abstract mathematical implications ( constraints on _ truth _ and _ probability _ assignments , gleason theorem @xcite , kochen - specker theorem @xcite ) and for their fundamental role in the analysis of empirical correlations ( bell @xcite , mermin @xcite , pitowsky @xcite ) .    most notably , gleason s result shows that the partial boolean structure of qm given by the set of boolean algebras of projections of a hilbert space of dimension @xmath0 forces the corresponding sets of probability measures to be given by quantum states .",
    "maximal boolean algebras define _ contexts _ , corresponding to the qm notion of _ jointly measurable observables _",

    ", they arise in general as a result of _ compatibility relations _ ( which can be formulated @xcite in terms of few properties of sequences of experiments ) characterizing sets of observables on which logical operations can be defined .    a basic problem behind the introduction of partial boolean structures is its necessity , i.e. whether their logical and probabilistic structures are compatible or not with a classical probability theory . more generally , one may ask whether partial classical extensions exist , giving joint probabilistic predictions for certain sets of _ incompatible _ observables .    in this language , the classical hidden variable  problem concerns the existence of a _ classical representation _ , identifying partial boolean structures and measures on them as restrictions of a single probability theory . more generally , the existence of a classical description for sets larger than the given contexts plays an important role in the discussion of the interpretation of qm and gives rise to a more general extension problem .    the object of the present paper is a general analysis of partial classical structures , given by",

    "the aim of rest of the paper is to discuss the problem of the extension of partial boolean structures .",
    "classical representability is the most studied issue and is usually discussed in terms of bell - like inequalities @xcite .",
    "their violation in qm excludes such a representability in general ; on the contrary , as we shall see , non - trivial partial extensions arise automatically in many cases ; on one side this gives an interpretation of bell - like inequalities as conditions for further extensions and allows for a more constructive discussion of their violation ; on the other side , such extensions give rise to a simplification of the computation of conditions of classical representability , reducing the problem to the compatibility of automatically provided solutions for certain subproblems .    in sect.[sec:34 ]",

    "a _ partial boolean algebra ( pba ) _ is a set @xmath4 together with a non - empty family @xmath5 of boolean algebras , @xmath6 , such that @xmath7 , that satisfy    * for every @xmath8 , @xmath9 and the boolean operations @xmath10 , @xmath11 of @xmath12 and @xmath13 coincide on it .    without loss of generality",

    "if one considers a finite set of projections , the result of the iteration of the above boolean operations ( on commuting projections ) is still a finite set and a partial boolean algebra .",
    "moreover , given a set of projections , the corresponding predictions given by a qm state define a ppt on the generated pba .",
    "in fact , given a pba of projections on a hilbert space @xmath32 , by the spectral theorem , a quantum mechanical state @xmath33 defines a state @xmath34 on it , given by @xmath35 .",
    "the generalization to density matrices is obvious .",
    "we shall name the so obtained ppts _ projection algebra partial probability theories_. we shall see in sect .",
    "[ sec : eq ] that they are not the only ppts that can be associated to qm predictions , other choices being implicit in different approaches to contextuality in qm .",

    "it has been shown in example [ es : bell ] that condition ( [ eq : alfabeta ] ) is equivalent to the complete ( in the sense of pitowsky@xcite ) set of chsh inequalities ; in other words that classical representability is equivalent to the possibility of an attribution of a value to the _ non - observable correlation _ @xmath382 which is consistent with the observable correlations .",
    "this example points out explicitly the role of predictions for non - observable correlations in every attempt to a classical interpretation of quantum mechanical predictions .",
    "this allows for an interpretation of the violation of bell inequalities as a negative answer to the question : given two incompatible observables is it possible to assign a value to their correlation which is _ consistent with measurable correlations _ ?",
    "it is interesting to notice that this consistency criterion is implicit in the argument by einstein podolsky and rosen .",
    "in fact , in their famous paper @xcite they discussed the possibility of extending quantum mechanical predictions to include correlations between incompatible observables with the requirement that such added ( non - observable ) correlations are consistent with the observable correlations ; in their case , a value is attributed to the momentum of a particle on the basis of its ( perfect anti- ) correlation with the momentum of the other particle , giving rise to a joint attribution of definite values to position and momentum of a single particle .",

    "therefore , it follows from definition of free boolean algebra that each map @xmath488 can be extended , in a unique way since @xmath44 is a set of generators , to a multiplicative measure .",
    "all possible @xmath489 maps on @xmath44 , are labeled by @xmath476 , i.e. @xmath490 , where such a correspondence is given by @xmath491 . since",

    "in this appendix we shall derive extension criteria which follow from the translation of pitowsky s correlation polytopes results into the boolean framework .",
    "first , we briefly outline pitowsky s result ( for pair correlations ) : given @xmath209 atomic propositions @xmath521 and positive numbers @xmath522 , @xmath523 associated to the propositions @xmath521 and some logical conjunction of them @xmath524 , @xmath525 , the numbers @xmath526 are interpretable in terms of classical probabilities ( i.e. there exists a probability space @xmath527 and @xmath209 events @xmath36 such that @xmath528 , @xmath529 ) if and only if the vector @xmath530 is a convex combination of the vectors @xmath531 , @xmath476 .",
    "the problem can be expressed in terms of free boolean algebras with the identification ( see givant and halmos @xcite ) of atomic propositions with free generators , logical operations with boolean operations , truth assignments with two - valued measures , and probability assignment with normalized measures . a basic fact is the following :    [ lemma : normmeas ] let @xmath62 be a finite boolean algebra with @xmath209 atoms @xmath450 ; then a function @xmath532 $ ] is a normalized measure @xmath533 @xmath534 , where @xmath455 is the multiplicative measure which is @xmath242 on @xmath454 , and @xmath535 and @xmath536 .",
    "* proof*. given @xmath215 , it can be written as a disjoint union @xmath452 , @xmath453",

    "the converse is obvious.@xmath157 + from this lemma we can obtain a criterion of extensibility to normalized measures for functions defined over a subset of a finite boolean algebra .",
    "in fact , if we consider a finite boolean algebra @xmath62 with @xmath541 atoms @xmath542 and a subset @xmath543 , then a function @xmath20 $ ] can be extended to normalized measure @xmath63 on @xmath62 if and only if there are @xmath541 numbers @xmath544 , with @xmath535 and @xmath545 , such that @xmath546 and @xmath63 is given by : @xmath547 therefore assignments of values in @xmath548 $ ] to elements of a subset of a boolean algebra have a probabilistic interpretation if and only if such values are given by a convex combination of two - valued measures .",
    "this construction is closely related to the notion of _ correlation polytopes _ , as shown by the following    [ prop : polit ] let @xmath62 be a boolean algebra freely generated by @xmath230 and consider @xmath543 with @xmath549 , i.e. , @xmath550 , @xmath551 , where elements of @xmath552 are the intersections of @xmath553 distinct generators , but not necessarily all of those possible , i.e. @xmath554",
    ". now consider @xmath20 $ ] and define the vector @xmath555 which has as components the values assumed by @xmath26 on @xmath4 , namely @xmath556 for every @xmath557 define the vector @xmath558 given by @xmath559 i.e. for every component @xmath560 of @xmath561 there is a corresponding component of @xmath562 given by @xmath563 .",
    "then @xmath26 can be extended to a normalized measure on @xmath62 if and only if there are @xmath473 numbers @xmath259 , @xmath564 , such that : @xmath565 @xmath566    * proof * given a free boolean algebra with @xmath209 free generators , there are ( see lemma [ lemma : atomlib ] ) @xmath473 atoms in a one - to - one correspondence with @xmath564 .",
    "the extensibility condition ( [ eq : est ] ) can therefore be written , with @xmath364 defined as in lemma [ lemma : atomlib ] , @xmath567 now it suffices to verify such a condition for every element of @xmath4 , which is equivalent to verify that the vector @xmath561 is a convex combination of the vectors @xmath562 .",
    "in fact , @xmath568 ( see the proof of lemma [ lemma : atomlib ] ) and @xmath569 , therefore :    @xmath570    we denote the correlation polytope associated with a subset @xmath571 of the above mentioned form as @xmath572 .    a helpful fact",
    "about the characterization of measures is the following    [ lemma : misunic ] let @xmath62 be a boolean algebra freely generated by @xmath210 , let @xmath63 be a measure on @xmath62 and let @xmath543 the set of all possible intersections between the free generators of @xmath62 , i.e. @xmath573 . then the measure @xmath63 is uniquely defined by the values it assumes on the set @xmath4 .",
    "* proof * since @xmath62 is a finite algebra , it is atomic .",
    "therefore every element @xmath467 can be written in a unique way as a disjoint union of atoms , @xmath574 , where @xmath476 , @xmath575 is the atom given by the bijection of lemma [ lemma : atomlib ] and @xmath576 @xmath577 @xmath578 @xmath579 .",
    "it follows that @xmath580 since atoms are disjoint , therefore the measure is completely defined by the values assumed on atoms .",
    "now , it suffices to prove that the measure of every atom is uniquely determined by the values assumed by @xmath63 on the elements of @xmath4 . but",
    "this follows from the fact that every atom can be written in the form @xmath575 and the property of measures @xmath581 in fact , consider an atom @xmath582 ; if @xmath583 for all @xmath22 , then @xmath584 so there is nothing to show .",
    "assume , therefore , that there is @xmath585 such that @xmath586 ; thus , for ( [ eq : smdisg ] ) , @xmath587 can be written in terms of elements of @xmath4 as @xmath588 .",
    "if there is more than one component of @xmath498 equal to @xmath242 , this process can be iterated until @xmath587 is written in terms of elements of @xmath4.@xmath157 + the above general results provide a criterion for the extensibility of functions defined over a subset of a free boolean algebra to normalized measures on the entire algebra , and therefore a criterion of classical representability for ppts .",
    "a simple application is given by the following result :    [ prop : algdisg ] let @xmath62 be the boolean algebra freely generated by @xmath210 , let @xmath324 and @xmath325 be the subalgebras generated respectively by @xmath326 and @xmath589 with @xmath590 , and let @xmath329 and @xmath330 be two normalized measure respectively on @xmath324 and @xmath325 . then there exists a normalized measure @xmath63 on @xmath62 such that @xmath591 and @xmath592 .",
    "* proof * every atom @xmath364 , @xmath564 ( see lemma [ lemma : atomlib ] ) , of @xmath62 can be written uniquely as @xmath593 where @xmath505 is an atom of @xmath324 , @xmath336 and @xmath345 is an atom of @xmath325 , @xmath594 .",
    "then @xmath63 can be defined as @xmath595 for all atoms @xmath596 .",
    "it is obviously a measure ( non - negative and additive on disjoint elements ) ; conditions @xmath597 , @xmath318 and normalization condition follow easily from ( [ eq : atomsubalgebra ] ) ( see lemma [ lemma : atomlib ] ) and normalization conditions for @xmath329 and @xmath330 .",
    "@xmath157 + this provides a direct elementary construction of a classical extension for a ppt where boolean subalgebras of compatible observables have only trivial ( i.e. @xmath598 ) intersections;this is the case , e.g. , of a ( finite ) collection of spin measurements on a spin @xmath599 particle discussed by bell @xcite and kochen and specker @xcite .",
    "the notion of _ partial measure _ was introduced by horn and tarski @xcite to analyze the possibility of extending a measure defined on a subalgebra of a boolean algebra , or even a function defined on an arbitrary subset of the algebra , to a measure on the entire algebra .",
    "even if such a notion was not related to qm by the authors , the reduction of the extension problem to the case of h - t ppts transforms the h - t results into fundamental general criteria of classical representability .",

    "another important property is shown by the following        [ def : intest ] let @xmath616 , and @xmath26 be a partial measure on @xmath219 and @xmath618 .",

    "we remark that horn and tarski s notion of partial measure has nothing to do with partial boolean algebras , in the kochen - specker or in our version , nor with partial probability theories ; even if h - t partial measures are defined only on subsets , they satisfy conditions which imply their _ extensibility to measures on the entire algebra_. our approach is rather based on a comparison of the two notions , with the result of transforming the h - t conditions for h - t partial measures into extensibility conditions for ppts , in the case of pbas which are embeddable in a boolean algebra .    since the condition in theorem [ teo : estmisparz ] is obviously also necessary , the extensibility criterion provided by partial measures is equivalent to the correlation polytope criterion .",
    "in particular , this implies that inequalities derived from the correlation polytope criterion ( proposition [ prop : polit ] ) are equivalent to those derived from condition @xmath147 of definition [ def : mispar ] .",
    "it should be also remarked that , while pitowsky s correlation polytopes implicitly assume a free boolean structure , horn and tarski s extensibility criterion also applies to non - free boolean algebras and to more general subsets with respect to those considered in proposition [ prop : polit ] ; in principle , therefore , the h - t criterion also allows for a direct analysis of extensions of states on a pba in the framework of projection algebra ppts .",
