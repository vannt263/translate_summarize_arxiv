    "rational ( or 2-bridge ) knots and links constitute an important class of links for which many problems of knot theory can be completely solved and provide examples often leading to general theorems about arbitrary knots and links . for the basics on rational ( 2-bridge ) knots and links",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as regards the definition , we follow @xcite , while the majority of properties that we need , are to be found in a more detailed exposition of @xcite . in particular , by _ equivalence _ of ( oriented ) links @xmath0 and @xmath1 we understand a smooth isotopy of @xmath2 which takes the union @xmath3 into the union @xmath3 , possibly interchanging the components of the link .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be mutually prime integers , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and we have a continued fraction @xmath8 where @xmath9 are nonzero integers ( positive or negative ) .",
    "below , we will use shorthand notation[short_cf ] @xmath10 $ ] for the continued fraction with denominators @xmath11 .",
    "a theorem of schubert ( see , for instance , @xcite ) says that the ( isotopy type of the ) resulting unoriented link does not depend on the choice of the continued fraction for the given number @xmath12 .",
    "the case @xmath13 is exceptional : it corresponds to the trivial knot which is the only rational , but not 2-bridge knot . on some occasions",
    ", it will be helpful to allow the numbers @xmath9 also take values @xmath14 and @xmath15 subject to the rules @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .    consider a braid on four strands corresponding to the word @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are fragments depicted in figure [ elements ] and concatenated from left to right .",
    "@xmath22{ap }   & \\qquad & \\includegraphics[height=15mm]{am }   & \\qquad & \\includegraphics[height=15mm]{bp }   & \\qquad & \\includegraphics[height=15mm]{bm } \\\\ a & \\qquad & a^{-1 } & \\qquad & b & \\qquad & b^{-1 } \\end{array}\\ ] ]    then take the closure of this braid depending on the parity of @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "[ closure ] ) .    we will call ( non - oriented ) diagrams obtained in this way _",
    "natural diagrams of rational links _ and denote them by @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "we shall denote the link represented by this diagram as @xmath25 . for odd denominators",
    "@xmath25 turns out to be a knot , while for even denominators it is a two - component link .",
    "such knots and links are called _",
    "2-bridge _ or _ rational_.    * example .",
    "* we have , among others , the following two continued fractions for the rational number 4/7 ( we use shorthand notation , see page ): @xmath26 = [ 2,-4].\\ ] ] these fractions correspond to the natural link diagrams shown in figure [ nat_diag ] .    , title=\"fig:\",height=52 ] , title=\"fig:\",height=52 ]",
    "note that , if a natural diagram represents a two - component link , then the two vertical leftmost fragments belong to different components .",
    "if they are oriented in the same direction , as shown in figure [ pos_orient ] , then we call the diagram _ positive _ and denote it by @xmath27 $ ]",
    ".    if the orientation of one of the components is reversed , then we call it _ negative _ and denote by @xmath28 $ ]",
    ". it does not matter which component of the link is reversed , because the change of orientation of both components yields the same link , see @xcite . as we will see later ( lemmas [ plusminus ] and [ dual ] ) , the choice between the corresponding links does not depend on a particular continued fraction expansion of the number @xmath12 .",
    "this makes the notations @xmath29 and @xmath30 well - defined .",
    "let @xmath31 , if @xmath6 , and @xmath32 , if @xmath33 .",
    "according to @xcite , we have : @xmath34 , therefore , in principle , it is sufficient to study only the totality of all positive rational links . in the case of knots ( when @xmath5 is odd ) , the two oppositely oriented knots are isotopic , and we have @xmath35[chnge_knot ] ( again , see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to study only the knots with an even numerator ( cf .",
    "lemma [ even_prod ] below ) .",
    "another important operation on links is the reflection in space ; it corresponds to the change of sign of the corresponding rational number : @xmath36 , see @xcite .",
    "the two symmetry operations on rational links generate a group @xmath37 ; they are transparently exemplified by the examples @xmath38 , which correspond to the four versions of the so called _ solomon knot _ ( although it is actually a two - component link ) :    @xmath39&=\\raisebox{-7mm}{\\includegraphics[height=14mm]{sol1_4}}\\\\[2 mm ] l(-1/4)\\leftrightarrow d^+[-4]&=\\raisebox{-7mm}{\\includegraphics[height=14mm]{sol-1_4}}\\\\[2 mm ] l(3/4)\\leftrightarrow d^+[1,3]&=\\raisebox{-7mm}{\\includegraphics[height=14mm]{sol3_4}}\\\\[2 mm ] l(-3/4)\\leftrightarrow d^+[-1,-3]&=\\raisebox{-7mm}{\\includegraphics[height=14mm]{sol-3_4}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    by dragging the lower strand of the diagram for @xmath40 upwards we get the diagram for @xmath41 with the opposite orientation of the upper strand . the same is true for the pair @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "in 20042005 japanese mathematicians s.fukuhara @xcite and y.mizuma @xcite found independently different explicit formulae for the simplest invariant polynomial of 2-bridge links : the conway ( alexander ) polynomial .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to establish a formula for a more general homfly polynomial @xmath44 in terms of the number @xmath12 that defines the rational link .",
    "the homfly polynomial @xcite is a laurent polynomial in two variables @xmath45 and @xmath46 uniquely defined by the following relations ( we use the normalization of @xcite and @xcite ; other authors may write the same polynomial in different pairs of variables , for example , lickorish @xcite uses @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are links that differ inside a certain ball as shown in figure [ homfly_fig ] .    as we mentioned in the previous section , in the case of rational knots ,",
    "the change of orientation gives the same ( isotopic ) knot , while for links it is important to distinguish between the two essentially different orientations ( this number is two , not four , because the change of orientation on both components gives the same rational link ) .",
    "there is a simple formula relating the homfly polynomials of a knot ( link ) with that of its mirror reflection ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) , so in principle it is enough to study only the knots ( links ) described by positive fractions .",
    "homfly polynomials of some links are given below in figure [ homfly_torus ] and table [ homflytab ] .",

    "that is , we consider a family of links with a distinguished block where the strands are counter - directed .",

    ".    we will prove that every natural diagram @xmath112 $ ] is oriented isotopic to the canonical ( even ) natural diagram .",
    "to do so , we follow the induction argument used in lemma [ even_prod ] ( sufficiency part ) .",
    "in fact , the induction step used there consists of one of the two transformations on the sequence @xmath117 :    \\(1 ) @xmath118\\longmapsto[s , s+1,-1,1-t , t]$ ] , if @xmath119 ,    \\(2 ) @xmath118\\longmapsto[s , s-1,1,-1-t , t]$ ] , if @xmath120 ,    where @xmath121 are arbitrary integers and @xmath122 are arbitrary sequences .",

    "( remind that , for links , the number @xmath23 is odd ) .",
    "we see that the two corresponding links are isotopic with the orientation of both components changed .",
    "but the total change of orientation is a link equivalence ( see @xcite ) .    in a canonical diagram of a rational link , due to the fact that all blocks are of even length ,",
    "the strands are everywhere counter - directed .",
    "therefore , lemma [ p_of_ln ] can be applied recursively : @xmath131)=&\\,a^{{\\varepsilon}_nb_n } p(d^+[b_1,\\dots , b_{n-1},0 ] )    + z{{1-a^{{\\varepsilon}_nb_n}}\\over{a - a^{-1 } } } p(d^+[b_1,\\dots , b_{n-1},\\infty])\\\\    = & \\,a^{{\\varepsilon}_nb_n } p(d^+[b_1,\\dots , b_{n-2 } ] )    + z{{1-a^{{\\varepsilon}_nb_n}}\\over{a - a^{-1 } } } p(d^+[b_1,\\dots , b_{n-1 } ] ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because the following two pairs of diagrams are equivalent as links : @xmath132=d^+[b_1,\\dots , b_{n-2}]$ ] and @xmath133=d^+[b_1,\\dots , b_{n-1}]$ ] .",
    "the sign @xmath134 comes from our convention of counting the number of twists in the first and the second layers of a natural diagram ( see figure [ elements ]  the powers of @xmath20 and @xmath21 correspond to odd and even values of @xmath23 , respectively ) .    for a given sequence @xmath135 $ ] denote @xmath136)$ ] .",
