    "since an fe atom has one more electron than a mn atom , replacing mn by fe will play the role of donating one extra electron to the ordinary mn@xmath0 structure . in the second case , since a pph@xmath4 molecule has one unpaired electron , addition of pph@xmath4 molecules to a mn@xmath0 molecule is equivalent to adding single - electron donors to the mn@xmath0 molecule . in our calculations ,",
    "k atoms were used instead of large pph@xmath4 molecules because a k atom also has one unpaired electron and it reduces computational cost . in the sense that there are extra electrons in the ordinary mn@xmath0 structure , we call the smms under the new environment the anionic smm mn@xmath0 . for both categories ,",
    "we consider one- , two- , and four- extra electrons donated to the mn@xmath0 molecule .",
    "for each anionic state , we calculate the electronic structure , the total magnetic moment , and the magnetic anisotropy parameters , using dft .",
    "we find that fe substitution provides similar results ( not exactly same ) to k addition and that some microenvironments drastically alter the magnetic structure . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe our detailed model and method . in secs .",

    "an optimized geometry is obtained when forces on all atoms become small . to find the ground - state spin configuration , different spin configurations with different total magnetic moments",
    "are considered .",
    "the second - order magnetic anisotropy parameters are calculated for an optimized geometry using the technique described in ref .",

[ fig : mn8fe4 ] ) .",
    "earlier calculations on the mn@xmath0 molecule showed that the energy gap between the majority homo ( highest occupied molecular orbital ) and the minority ( majority ) lumo ( lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ) is about 0.804  ev ( 0.438  ev).@xcite the calculated majority homo - lumo energy gap agreed with the result of the recent electrical resistivity measurement , 0.37@xmath310.05  ev.@xcite the total ground - state moment was calculated to be 20@xmath32 , which agreed with experiment .",
    "the calculated second - order mab was 54  k in zero field , which did not change much with our simplification of the molecule . hereafter , unless specified , fe substitution and k addition will be carried out in the above simplified form of a mn@xmath0 molecule .",
    "for the optimized geometry of the mn@xmath0 molecule , the first four unoccupied majority orbitals directly above the fermi level are close to each other in energy but well separated from the rest of unoccupied orbitals .",
    "the four orbitals contain the lumo , an orbital 0.008  ev above the lumo , and doubly degenerate orbitals 0.012  ev above the lumo .",
    "the fifth orbital is 0.212  ev above the lumo .",
    "because the third and fourth orbitals are degenerate , the case of three extra electrons is not considered in our dft calculations .",
    "but our prediction of the case based on symmetry will be provided in sec .",
    "v. we first examine whether there are any favorable sites for the extra electrons in the mn@xmath0 geometry when four fe ions are substituted in a s@xmath4 symmetric fashion .",
    "then when four- , two- , and one - extra electrons are accepted in a mn@xmath0 molecule under each type of environment , we calculate homo - lumo energy gaps , the total ground - state moment , and the ground - state spin configuration . in various ways ,",
    "we examine whether the extra electrons are well localized at some of the mn sites . using the optimized geometry with the ground - state spin configuration , we calculate the mab , the transverse magnetic anisotropy parameter @xmath1 , and the magnetic easy axis . when experimental data are available , comparison between calculations and experiment are discussed .",

    "[ fig : spin_config](a ) ( only the direction of each mn moment is assigned such as spin up or down ) .",

    "if there exist appreciable homo - lumo energy gaps and the calculated orbitals abide by the fermi filling , then the system is regarded as being magnetically stable .",

    "these local moments are definitely larger than those at the other outer mn sites , 3.59 - 3.64@xmath32 , for the mn@xmath26fe@xmath4 geometries or those at the outer mn sites , 3.55 - 3.62@xmath32 , for the mn@xmath0 geometry . but the local moment at the fe site for the geometry @xmath33 is greatly reduced to @xmath36  @xmath32 .",
    "this is because the initial spin configuration [ fig .",
