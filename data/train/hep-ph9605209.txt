    "0.7truecm  @xmath1 work supported by the national swiss foundation    a direct measure of the spin - dependent gluon density in the proton , @xmath2 , has never been performed ( see ref .",
    "[ [ review ] ] for a recent review on polarized nucleon structure ) . polarized",
    "deep inelastic scattering data allow to extract the structure function @xmath3 at different values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 and to obtain an indirect determination of @xmath6 through scaling violation  [ [ bfr1]-[stratmannvogelsang ] ] . however , such indirect determinations are affected by large uncertainties , because of limited statistics and limited coverage of the @xmath7 range of the presently available experimental data . on the other hand ,",
    "a precise knowledge of the polarized gluon density is important in order to understand various aspects of the structure of polarized nucleons .",
    "for example , it has long been known [ [ altarelliross ] , [ altarellilampe ] ] that the anomalous gluon contribution to the first moment of @xmath8 , although formally of order @xmath9 , does not vanish in the large-@xmath5 limit , and therefore affects the extraction of the singlet axial charge from polarized deep inelastic scattering data .",
    "furthermore , an independent determination of @xmath6 would allow to test the reliability of the perturbative expansion , and to assess the importance of possible non - perturbative contributions .    in order to measure @xmath6 directly ,",
    "it is necessary to consider processes which are only or predominantly initiated by gluons ; many have been studied in the past , like for example heavy quarkonia production in photon - gluon fusion  [ [ guillet ] ] , or the production of large-@xmath10 jet pairs in deep - inelastic scattering  [ [ altarellistirling],[carlitzcollinsmueller ] ] .",
    "another interesting possibility is the production of heavy quarks in photon - proton collisions .",
    "this process has already been considered in refs .",
    "[ [ gluckreya]-[vogelsang ] ] in view of the possibilities of the electron - proton collider hera , and the conclusion was reached that the study of total cross section asymmetries for heavy - quark photoproduction at hera can be of little help in constraining the polarized gluon density in the proton . in this letter",
    "we reconsider this problem , in the light of recent experimental information on polarized deep inelastic scattering [ [ smc],[e143 ] ] and improved theoretical understanding , and of the planned values of luminosity for the hera collider .",
    "we will also consider the impact of realistic experimental cuts on the observed quantities , and discuss some theoretical uncertainties .",
    "we will always refer to the production of charm quark - antiquark pairs , since this is the most favourable case for the kind of study we are considering here .",
    "in the case of electroproduction , using the weizscker - williams approximation we have d_ep(s , t)=f_ww(x_,q^2_ww ) g(x_g,_f^2)d_g(,,_r^2 ) dx_g dx _ , [ deltaep ] where f_ww(x_,q^2_ww)= , and we defined @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the electron four - momentum .",
    "the mass scale @xmath28 entering the weizscker - williams function has been chosen as discussed in ref .",
    "[ [ fmnrww ] ] .",
    "we will consider the three fits to @xmath6 presented in ref .",
    "[ [ gehrmannstirling ] ] , which we will indicate with gs - a , gs - b , gs - c , and those presented in ref .  [ [ bfr2 ] ] , denoted by bfr - ab , bfr - os and bfr - ar .",
    "the three parametrizations of @xmath6 given in ref .",
    "[ [ bfr2 ] ] are obtained by performing fits to data within three different subtraction schemes for collinear divergences . since a next - to - leading order calculation of the polarized partonic cross sections",
    "is not available , the scheme choice is immaterial in our analysis .",
    "we begin by considering total cross sections . in the first row of table",
    "[ totals ] we present ( columns indicated with i ) the total charm production cross section computed at next - to - leading order [ [ ellisnason]-[fmnr ] ] .",
    "we show both the electroproduction results , obtained using the weizscker - williams approximation at the hera center - of - mass energy of 314 gev , and the photoproduction results , with a center - of - mass energy of the photon - proton system of 200 gev .",
    "the factorization and renormalization scales are chosen equal to @xmath29 and @xmath12 respectively ( see ref .  [ [ fmnrphoto ] ] for a detailed discussion of scale choices ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we also show ( columns ii ) the values of total cross sections with the conditions [ cutpt ] & & p_t > 2 + [ cuteta ] & & < 1.5 , imposed on the transverse momentum @xmath30 and the pseudorapidity @xmath31 of the observed heavy quark , ( assuming that only one of the two heavy quarks produced is fully reconstructed ) .",
    "the conditions ( [ cutpt ] ) and ( [ cuteta ] ) approximately reproduce the present experimental situation of the hera experiments .",
    "finally , we show ( columns iii ) the effect of applying the peterson fragmentation function  [ [ peterson ] ] to the produced charm quarks , in order to estimate the impact of hadronization phenomena . in columns",
    "iii the cuts of eqs .",
    "( [ cutpt ] ) and ( [ cuteta ] ) are still applied .",
    "notice that in the absence of the cuts the total cross section values would be insensitive to fragmentation effects .",
    "on the other hand , the cuts introduce in the total cross section a dependence upon the @xmath30 and @xmath31 distributions ; in particular , since peterson fragmentation softens the @xmath30 spectrum , the low-@xmath30 region gives a contribution to the cross section larger than in the bare quark case .",
    "this explains the lower values of columns iii with respect to columns ii .    in the following six rows we display the values of the asymmetry @xmath32 in the same cases , obtained with the six different parametrizations of @xmath6 .",
    "it must be stressed that the unpolarized cross section @xmath33 that appears in the denominator of the asymmetry is computed at the leading order , because a next - to - leading order calculation for the polarized cross section is not available .",
    "however , one might expect that the effect of radiative corrections approximately cancels in the ratio @xmath32 .",
    "notice that the asymmetries obtained with the fragmented quarks are larger than those for bare quarks , at variance with the case of the total cross sections .",
    "this is due to the fact that the dominant contribution to @xmath32 is given by the large-@xmath30 region , where the asymmetry values are larger for fragmented quarks than for bare ones .",
    "we will discuss again this issue when dealing with differential cross sections .",
    "the next - to - leading order value of @xmath33 can then be used to estimate the sensitivity of the experiment .",
    "a rough estimate of the minimum value of the asymmetry observable at hera can be obtained by requiring the difference between the numbers of events with parallel and antiparallel polarizations of the initial state particles to be larger than the statistical error on the total number of observed events .",
    "this gives _",
    "min , [ minassmtr ] where @xmath34 is the integrated luminosity and the factor @xmath35 accounts for the experimental efficiency for charm identification and the fact that the initial beams are not completely polarized .",
    "the values of @xmath36 in the various cases are given in the last row of table  [ totals ] , for @xmath37  pb@xmath38 .",
    "in the case of photoproduction , the effective luminosity has been estimated by assuming that the results obtained with photons such that 170  gev@xmath39  230 gev can be reliably described by the cross section for an incoming monochromatic photon with @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath41 luminosity of 100  pb@xmath38 has then been rescaled by a factor equal to the integral of the weizscker - williams function in the appropriate range .    by inspection of table  [ totals ] , we conclude that the asymmetries of practical interest ( columns ii and iii ) are always larger than the corresponding minimum observable values with an integrated luminosity of 100  pb@xmath38 even if an experimental efficiency of 1% is assumed .",
    "we also observe that the asymmetry is generally larger in the phase space region defined by eqs .",
    "( [ cutpt ] ) and ( [ cuteta ] ) . in practice",
    ", the quantity @xmath42 is required to be larger than 5 or 10 events , in order to distinguish the signal from the background .",
    "this condition appears to be fulfilled for all the cases considered in table  [ totals ] , with @xmath43 .",
    "we also observe that all the chosen parametrizations for the polarized gluon density give similar results for the total cross section asymmetry .",
    "it seems therefore difficult to distinguish among them with this kind of measurement .",
    "we now turn to differential distributions . from table",
    "[ totals ] we know that the asymmetry tends to become larger in the phase - space region where the conditions ( [ cutpt ] ) and ( [ cuteta ] ) are satisfied ; we will therefore present our predictions with the kinematical cuts ( [ cutpt ] ) and ( [ cuteta ] ) applied .",
    "we will consider only the gs - a and bfr - ab parametrizations .    in fig .",
    "[ ptel ] we show the asymmetry versus the transverse momentum of the observed quark for @xmath41 collision at a center - of - mass energy of 314  gev .",
    "the scale choice is @xmath44 , @xmath45 , with @xmath46 .",
    "as previously observed , the asymmetry increases with increasing transverse momentum .",
    "observe also that the asymmetry for fragmented quarks is always larger than that for bare quarks over the whole @xmath30 range considered , consistently with the analogous behaviour of total cross sections .",
    "the results obtained with the two parametrizations for @xmath6 are quite close to each other , although they display slightly different shapes : the bfr parametrization produces larger asymmetries in the low-@xmath30 region .",
    "the effect of peterson fragmentation on the shape of this distribution is very small . in fig .",
    "[ ptel ] we also show the quantity defined in eq .",
    "( [ minassmtr ] ) for @xmath47 and @xmath37  pb@xmath38 , as an indication for the minimum observable value of the asymmetry . in this case , the quantity @xmath33 appearing in the rhs of eq .  ( [ minassmtr ] ) is the next - to - leading order cross section for a given @xmath30 bin .",
    "we used a bin size of 1 gev ; clearly , a larger bin size would decrease the minimum observable asymmetry ; on the other hand , by enlarging the bins the resolution of the measurement would get worse . from fig .",
    "[ ptel ] , we can see that there exists a wide @xmath30 region where the predicted asymmetries are more than one order of magnitude above the corresponding minimum observable asymmetry .",
    "furthermore , the value of the asymmetry for @xmath30 above 10  gev is of the order of few tens of percent .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the @xmath30 distribution could be used to extract information on the polarized gluon density , even with a low experimental efficiency .",
    "the shape of the distribution could in principle provide with the possibility of discriminating among the various sets for @xmath6 .",
    "however , since the predictions for different sets are quite close to each other , this kind of measurement does not appear to be feasible with the planned luminosity values .",
    "figure  [ ptph ] is the analogous of fig .",
    "[ ptel ] for @xmath48 collisions at a center - of - mass energy of 200 gev .",
    "the asymmetry values turn out to be larger than for @xmath41 collisions in the whole @xmath30 range , and the curves appear to be slightly flatter than in the previous case . on the other hand , the minimum observable value is larger than before .",
    "we computed the effective luminosity for the incoming photon as in the case of total cross sections .",
    "it is also interesting to consider fully exclusive distributions , despite the fact that a large statistics is needed in order to reconstruct completely both the produced charm and anti - charm . in analogy with the unpolarized case ( see ref .  [ [ fmnrglu ] ] ) , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ deltaep ] ) as = f_ww(x_,q^2_ww ) g(x_g,_f^2)_g(m^2_c|c ) , [ ymdistr ] with x_&=&(-y_c|c ) , [ xgamma ] + x_g&=&(y_c|c ) .",
    "[ xg ] in eqs .",
    "( [ ymdistr ] ) , ( [ xgamma ] ) and  ( [ xg ] ) @xmath49 is the invariant mass of the @xmath19 pair , and @xmath50 its rapidity in the electron - proton center - of - mass frame .",
    "we have positive rapidities in the proton direction . identifying the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ ymdistr ] ) with the experimental data , we can invert this equation to get g(x_g,_f^2)= ( ) ^data .",
    "[ dgvsdata ]    we present our results directly in terms of the variable @xmath23 , exploiting the identity = x_g . in fig .",
    "[ xgel ] we show our predictions for the @xmath23 asymmetry in @xmath41 collisions at a center - of - mass energy of 314 gev . in this case , the reference scale @xmath51 is equal to @xmath52 .",
    "we do not present the result for the fragmented quarks .",
    "in fact , when peterson fragmentation is applied , @xmath23 is not expressed in terms of the invariant mass and rapidity of the pair as in eq .",
    "( [ xg ] ) .",
    "the correct relationship could in principle be worked out , but it is more straightforward to obtain the @xmath19 cross section by directly performing the deconvolution on the measured cross section for charmed hadron production .",
    "this procedure can be applied using different hadronization models , thus obtaining an estimate of the dependence of the result upon the assumed hadronization mechanism .    by inspection of fig .",
    "[ xgel ] , we can conclude that the polarized gluon density can be probed with a good resolution ( we used a bin size of 0.2 in the variable @xmath53 ) in the range @xmath54 , if the experimental efficiency is not too small .",
    "the gs - a and bfr - ab results are quite similar , and it appears unlikely that this kind of measurement could discriminate between them .    in this paper",
    "we have studied the problem of measuring the polarized gluon density in the proton using the charm data which will be collected at the hera collider in the polarized configuration .",
    "we used a leading - order qcd calculation , since the polarized short distance partonic cross sections are not available at the next - to - leading order .",
    "for this reason , we presented our results in terms of asymmetries , which are more likely to be stable under radiative corrections than the polarized or unpolarized cross sections .",
    "we have shown that , assuming an integrated luminosity of 100 pb@xmath38 , the total cross section asymmetries can be measured even with a very low experimental efficiency .",
    "the measurement of single - inclusive and double - differential distributions also appears to be feasible , although in the latter case a higher luminosity is certainly needed . with a luminosity of 100 pb@xmath38",
    ", it seems difficult to distinguish among the various parametrizations for the polarized gluon density .",
    "we have not considered the inclusion of the hadronic component of the photon , which is known to be important in the hera regime .",
    "unfortunately , no information on the polarized parton densities in the photon is available up to now , and therefore no theoretical estimate can be given .",
    "it is known  [ [ fnrdiff ] ] that the @xmath30 spectrum of the hadronic component is softer than the pointlike one in the unpolarized case , and therefore the cut of eq .",
    "( [ cutpt ] ) reduces the impact of the hadronic component on the full unpolarized results .",
    "this might not happen in the polarized case .",
    "however , for hadronic photons a sizeable fraction of the photon momentum is lost into hadronic fragments , that can be observed in the photon direction . in this way it should be possible to disentangle the hadronic component from the pointlike one .",
