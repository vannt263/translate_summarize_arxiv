    "ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs , makishima et al . 2000 and references therein ) are bright x - ray sources having luminosities greater than @xmath2 found in off - nuclear regions of nearby galaxies .",
    "the luminosity exceeds the eddington limit of a @xmath3 black hole ( bh ) that is the maximum mass expected from normal stellar evolutionary paths ( fryer & kalogera 2001 ) , and their origin is now a matter of hot debate .",
    "a few models have been proposed to explain the high luminosity from ordinary stellar mass black holes , such as geometrical beaming ( king et al .",
    "2001 ; king 2004 ) or super - eddington accretion ( begelman 2002 ) .",
    "however , clear observational evidence for these has not yet been found . on the other hand , the high luminosity",
    "may also be explained by intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) of @xmath4 , without violating the eddington limit .",
    "recently evidence for imbhs has been accumulating for many ulxs .",
    "they show lower temperature ( @xmath5 0.1 kev ) blackbody components than that of the galactic black hole binaries , which is consistent with imbhs being ulxs ( miller et al . 2004 ) .",
    "it is known that , for x - ray binaries and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , the break frequency of the power density spectrum of x - ray flux variability scales with the black hole mass , and the break frequency of ulxs is indeed between those of black hole binaries and agns , again indicating intermediate bh mass for ulxs ( cropper et al .",
    "it appears that at least a part of ulxs , especially the most luminous ones , are imbhs .",
    "( see e.g. , colbert & miller 2004 ; mushotzky 2004 for recent reviews . )",
    "however , the formation of imbhs to become ulxs is a challenging problem .",
    "one possibility is formation in dense stellar regions or stellar clusters ( portegies zwart & mcmillan 2002 ) .",
    "however , though ulxs are preferentially found in actively star forming regions , their position is near but not coincident with such stellar clusters , disfavoring this scenario ( zezas & fabbiano 2002 ) .    on the other hand",
    ", it is theoretically expected that imbhs form as remnants of massive population iii ( pop iii ) stars ( e.g. , schneider et al .",
    "2002 ) , and they may become ulxs if they accrete sufficient gas in nearby galaxies ( madau & rees 2001 ) . however , it is not easy to explain the observed number of ulxs by this scenario .",
    "islam , taylor & silk ( 2004 ) considered a possibility that free - floating imbhs accrete from a residual core of gas associated with the imbhs from their formation epoch .",
    "it is highly uncertain whether such gas core can survive until present from the early universe , and this scenario can not explain the majority of ulxs that are associated with star forming regions .",
    "volonteri & perna ( 2005 ) recently performed a similar calculation , and they found even more pessimistic prediction for the observable ulx number .",
    "krolik ( 2004 ) considered a possibility that free - floating imbhs become ulxs when they enter into dense molecular clouds in star forming regions of galactic disks , so that the association with star forming regions can be explained .",
    "krolik considered a hypothetical `` disk '' population of pop iii stars that form within a galactic disk , from primordial gas that has somehow been preserved until the disk formation .",
    "this is because the number of ulxs would be too small if , as normally expected , pop iii remnants are distributed in a galactic halo .",
    "it is an interesting possibility , but it is difficult to quantitatively estimate how much amount of such gas can survive during the formation of galactic disks .",
    "the efficiency of pop iii star formation is highly uncertain , but there are some observational hints .",
    "independent groups ( wright & reese 2000 ; cambrsy et al . 2001 ; matsumoto et al . 2004 ) reported detections of the cosmic near - infrared background radiation ( cnib ) , which can not be explained by normal galaxy populations ( totani et al .",
    "the excess is particularly large at @xmath6 m , which is at @xmath7@xmath8 level according to the irts data of matsumoto et al .",
    ", though there may still be large systematic uncertainty in the cnib measurements , such as zodiacal light subtraction .",
    "it has been shown that efficient formation of pop iii stars before @xmath9 can explan this unaccounted excess of cnib ( santos , bromm , & kamionkowski 2002 ; salvaterra & ferrara 2003 ) ; the spectral peak of the excess at @xmath10 m corresponds to the redshifted lyman @xmath11 line emission .",
    "the required amount of pop iii stars to explain the cnib is somewhat extreme ( see , e.g. , madau & silk 2005 ) ; about @xmath5 10% of the cosmic baryons must be converted into pop iii stars .",
    "however , paucity of theoretical understainding of pop iii stars does not allow to reject this possiblity completely , and it is the only one realistic explanation of the cnib excess , except for the systematic uncertainty in the cnib measurements .",
    "theoretical studies on pop iii star formation indicate that they are likely more massive than normal stars , and most of pop iii stars could be massive enough to collapse into imbhs without any metal ejection , meeting the metallicity constraints from quasar absorption line systems .",
    "the consequence of this scenario is that there should be imbhs with @xmath12@xmath13 in halos of nearby galaxies , whose mass fraction in the baryonic matter is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the cosmic baryon density in the standard definition .",
    "this is consistent with observational constraints from gravitational lensing experiments ( wambsganss 2002 ) and from stellar dynamics such as heating of disk stars ( wasserman & salpeter 1994 ) , disruption of globular clusters ( murali et al . 2000 ) , and disruption of halo wide binaries ( yoo et al . 2004 ) .    in this paper",
    "we show that , if this is the case , such imbhs passing through dense molecular clouds of star forming regions should have a siginificant contribution to the observed ulx population , especially to the highest luminosity ones . in  [ section : order ] , we give an order - of - magnitude estimate of the expected ulx number .",
    "we discuss two relevant physical processes in ",
    "[ section : df ] ( gas dynamical friction ) and  [ section : radiative - efficiency ] ( radiative efficiency of accretion disks ) . we will present a more detailed calculation of the predicted ulx luminosity function in  [ section : lf ] .",

    "detectability of isolated bhs accreting interstellar gas has been studied in a number of publications ( fujita et al .",

    "there is no ulx in our galaxy , and the number is known to be proportional to star formation rate ( sfr ) of galaxies ( grimm , gilfanov , & sunyaev 2003 ) . under a reasonable assumption that the amount of molecular gas clouds in a galaxy is proportional to sfr of the galaxy , the number of ulx should also scale with sfr .",
    "then @xmath51 of a starburst galaxy like the antennae is @xmath82 times larger than that of our galaxy .",
    "the number of ulxs in such a galaxy is then estimated to be @xmath83 for @xmath84 , while in the antennae @xmath85 ulxs are observed above @xmath86 ( zezas & fabbiano 2002 ) .",
    "this is an encouraging result ; it should be noted that the observed ulxs probably include ordinary x - ray binaries in the luminosity range of @xmath5(13)@xmath87 . in the following sections , we discuss two more physical processes ; one ( gas dynamical friction )",
    "may enhance the ulx number and the other ( radiative efficiency of accretion ) is important to reproduce the observed luminosity function of x - ray sources .",
    "[ section : df ]    the expected number of ulxs is sensitively dependent on the relative velocity @xmath21 , since @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , if there is a process that reduces the speed of imbhs in molecular clouds , it would significantly enhance the expected ulx number .",
    "dynamical friction is a possible effect , and considering that the star formation efficiency in molecular clouds is generally low ( stellar to gas mass ratio @xmath90 0.010.1 , myers et al . 1986 ; larson 1988 ) , the dynamical friction by gas will be more efficient than by stars .",
    "the gas dynamical friction time scale is given by ( ostriker 1999 ) @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the friction force , @xmath93/(@xmath94 ) , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the sizes of surrounding medium and the object receiving the force , respectively , and @xmath97 is a parameter of order unity to take account of the uncertainty in the formula .",
    "here we took @xmath98 20 pc and @xmath99 km ( @xmath5 schwartzschild radius is captured by the imbh , and momentum loss by the accretion leads to a similar formula that is different only by numerical factors . ] ) for the coulomb logarithm , @xmath100 .",
    "this should be compared to the crossing time of molecular clouds , @xmath101 where the size of typical molecular clouds is given as @xmath102 ( larson 1981 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath103 becomes of order unity for @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath21 and @xmath39 indicates that this is achieved only for objects having the highest accretion rate , i.e. , ulxs .",
    "therefore this process could boost up the ulx luminosity particularly at the brightest end of the ulx luminosity function .",
    "so far we assumed that the x - ray luminosity is proportional to the bondi accretion rate , i.e. , a constant radiative efficiency , @xmath106 .",
    "however , in this case we have a serious problem about the ulx luminosity function . since @xmath107 , while @xmath108 , a robust prediction is that the luminosity function should scale as @xmath109 with @xmath110 . on the other hand , the observed luminosity function of ulx in star forming galaxies is smoothly connected might be a different population from lower luminosity ones ( liu , bregman , & irwin 2005 ) . in our scenario , the similarity between the number of imbh - ulxs and extralopation of the hmxb luminosity function must be a coincidence . ] to that of high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , with a slope of @xmath111 in a wide luminosity range of @xmath112@xmath113 ( grimm et al .",
    "2003 ) . therefore ,",
    "even if we successfully explained the observed number of ulxs , it would overproduce the observable number of low - luminosity x - ray sources by the same imbh population .",
    "this problem can be solved if we take into account the change of accretion mode at low accretion rate compared with the eddington rate ; recent studies established that accretion disks change their state from standard thin disks to radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riafs ) , at luminosity below @xmath5 10% of the eddington luminosity ( kato , fukue , & mineshige 1998 ; narayan 2004 ) . in the riaf regime , the luminosity scales roughly @xmath114 , and hence the luminosity function slope of ulxs becomes @xmath115 , avoiding the overproduction problem of low luminosity sources .",
    "here we calculate the ulx luminosity function by integrating numerically over @xmath39 , @xmath21 , and the location of a bh in the galaxy .",
    "the calculation is based on the formulation of agol & kamionkowski ( 2002 ) , but we also include the follwing two effects discussed above .",
    "( i ) to make the luminosity proportional to @xmath116 in the riaf regime , the radiative efficiency is reduced as @xmath117 when @xmath118 , while @xmath119 for @xmath120 , where @xmath121 , @xmath122 the eddington luminosity , and @xmath123 is a constant parameter to determine the efficiency around the eddington accretion rate .",
    "( ii ) the relation @xmath124 is replaced by @xmath125 to take into account the dynamical friction , where @xmath126 and @xmath21 ( @xmath127 ) are the velocity before and after an imbh passes through a molecular cloud having the size @xmath128 ( see  [ section : df ] ) , whose relation is determined by solving the equation of motion with the dynamical friction . since the initial mass function ( imf ) of pop iii stars is highly uncertain , we simply calculate for a @xmath129-function imf with @xmath130 and @xmath13 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "we scale up the luminosity function of the galaxy to that for a galaxy with sfr@xmath131 , to compare with the observed data of the universal luminosity function constructed by x - ray sources in different galaxies and normalized by sfr , where sfr@xmath132 is sfr for stars heavier than @xmath133 and sfr@xmath134 for our galaxy ( grimm et al .",
    "2003 ) . considering the uncertainties , we show eight calculations with @xmath135 or @xmath136 , @xmath137 or @xmath138 , and @xmath139 or @xmath140 .",
    "it should be noted that the parameter @xmath123 also includes the uncertainty in the bondi - hoyle accretion formula .",
    "still , the case of @xmath141 is rather unlikely , but we take this value as a maximally possible one .",
    "the choice of @xmath142 may also be extreme , but we took this value to show the effect of dynamical friction clearly .",
    "there are two breaks in the model curves : one corresponding to the transition luminosity between the two accretion modes ( the standard thin disk or riaf ) at @xmath143 , and another corresponding to the luminosity above which @xmath144 .",
    "as expected , the dynamical friction effect boosts up the luminosity function at the brightest luminosity range .",
    "these results show that at least a part of the brightest ulxs ( @xmath145 ) can be explained by our scenario , without overproducing low luminosity sources in the range of @xmath146 , where normal hmxbs are dominant .",
    "( therefore we do not have to explain all of the low luminosity sources . )",
    "especially , with @xmath147 , the number of the most luminous ulxs ( @xmath148 erg / s ) can be explained with a modest value of @xmath149 , favoring a larger imbh mass .",
    "the enhancement of imbh density around galactic disks by baryon compression may further increase the number of ulxs , possibly allowing a lower imbh mass ( see  [ section : conclusion ] ) .",
    "if the radiative feedback and ionization of ambient gas are siginificant , @xmath24 should be raised to @xmath150 and the number of ulx would be significantly reduced , especially in the case of @xmath151 . however , in the next section we will argue that this effect is not necessarily strong .",
    "the ulx luminosity is sufficient to ionize the surrounding medium ; the strmgren radius is @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the fraction of ionizing luminosity above 13.6 ev compared with @xmath38 , and @xmath154 .",
    "this is in most cases larger than the bondi accretion radius , @xmath155 therefore , when an ulx ionizes the surrounding medium , the bondi accretion rate should reduce , because of the increased @xmath24 and expansion of gas driven by increased pressure . however , the gas that has already accreted to form an accretion disk will serve as the energy source of the ulx phenomenon for some time after the ionization .",
    "based on the interstellar density gradient and angular momentum conservation , the interstellar gas captured by an imbh should form a rotationally supported disk at a radius @xmath156 ( agol & kamionkowski 2002 ) , which is much smaller than the bondi accretion radius , @xmath157 . assuming that the further accretion proceeds by @xmath11-viscousty in the standard thin disk , accretion rate for ulx - level luminosity is not achieved until a sufficient amount of mass is accumulated and the surface mass density @xmath158 at @xmath159 reaches that of the standard disk for the mass accretion rate of ulxs , @xmath20 .",
    "it would take a time of @xmath160 .",
    "then ulx activity will last for a time scale of the disk mass consumption , @xmath161 , even after the ulx ionizes the surrounding medium .",
    "therefore both the time scale of turning on of ulxs and duration of the ulx phenomenon are given by the accretion time scale of the standard disk , @xmath162 ( the outer region of the three regions in the standard disk theory applies at @xmath159 . )",
    "it is interesting that this time scale for an ulx with @xmath163 is similar to the crossing time scale @xmath164 yr of a @xmath165 cloud (  [ section : df ] ) .",
    "this means that the duty cycle as an ulx could effectively be of order unity for an imbh passing through a molecular cloud , even if the radiative feedback is significant .",
    "we conclude that the observed number of ulxs can be explained by halo population imbhs passing through dense molecular clouds , which were produced as pop iii star remnants , if the pop iii star formation was very efficient as recently indicated by the unaccounted excess of the cosmic near - infrared background radiation .",
    "luminosity function was calculated , and the ulxs of our scenario contribute to the observed luminosity function especially at the largest luminosity range , without overproducing sources in low - luminosity range where stellar - mass black holes are the dominant contribution .",
    "the ulx phenomena could last for @xmath166 yr and the duty cycle in a molecular cloud could be of order unity .",
    "we considered molecular clouds with a denstiy range of @xmath167@xmath168 , but rather low - density clouds of @xmath169 have the largest contribution to the expected ulx number .",
    "it is consistent with observations of ulx locations ; many ulxs are found in star forming regions but in outskirts of large concentrations of gas ( zezas et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "large ionized , expanding optical nebulae with a size of @xmath170 100 pc are often associated with ulxs , with estimated total expansion energy of @xmath171 erg and age of @xmath172 yr ( pakull & mirioni 2002 ; mushotzky 2004 ) .",
    "our estimate of the ulx duration is consistent with this age , and the total energy emitted by an ulx with @xmath173 could be as large as @xmath174 erg .",
    "a part of this energy may be emitted in uv and soft x - ray bands to ionize and expand the ambient medium , giving an explanation for the observed optical nebulae .",
    "the estimated ulx duration is not very different from the eddington time scale , @xmath175 yr .",
    "therefore , some ulxs may have a chance to accrete gas for a time scale comparable to or longer than @xmath176 , by passing through a large molecular cloud or many molecular clouds .",
    "such imbhs will increase their mass considerably .",
    "in fact , the imbh mass used in our calculation is not necessarily that of the pop iii remnants .",
    "the mass function of imbhs in the local universe may have been altered from the original one at the formation epoch , by merging or gas accretion in the hierarchical structure formation .",
    "such calculations have been performed by islam , taylor , & silk ( 2004 ) and volonteri & perna ( 2005 ) . according to these calculations , typical mass of free - floating imbhs",
    "may be increased up to @xmath177 depending on model parameters , even if the initial mass of pop iii remnant bhs is less than 1000 @xmath178 .",
    "the very large bh mass suggested for the extremely bright ulx in m82 ( matsumoto et al .",
    "2001 ; kaaret et al .",
    "2001 ) may be achieved by such processes .",
    "we used the popular nfw density profile for the galactic halo , but the dark matter density could be significantly altered and increased around the region of the galactic disk , by adiabatic compression during the infall of baryonic gas to form stars .",
    "the number of ulxs would then be increased , because more imbhs exist around the galactic disk and the weighted mean surface density of molecular gas is also increased .",
    "according to the model by klypin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we estimate the boost factor of the ulx number as @xmath179 . on the other hand",
    ", the same authors also shown that a modest exchange of angular momentum between baryonic and dark matter ( through e.g. , a rotating bar - like bulge ) may result in almost no enhancement , or even decrease of the dark matter density .",
    "this should be taken into consideration as an uncertainty in the prediction made here , though the main conclusions are unlikely to be changed .",
    "finally we give a list of the predictions for ulxs produced by the scenario proposed here .",
    "since ulxs are isolated imbhs , optical counterparts ( donor stars ) will not be found .",
    "future observations should confirm the trend that ulxs are preferentially found in star forming regions , but at outskirts of dense molecular clouds where the density is about @xmath5 100 @xmath180 .",
    "expanding nebulae with kinetic energy of @xmath171 erg should often be associated , _ without _ evidence for a past hypernova or multiple supernovae .",
    "the predicted slope of the imbh luminosity function is @xmath115 at low luminosity range , which is similar to that of hmxbs .",
    "therefore , in a wide range of luminosity , we expect that a small fraction of low - luminosity x - ray sources are the same population with imbh - ulxs , showing riaf spectra without companion stars .",
    "it is interesting to search for such a population in the galaxy or nearby galaxies .",
