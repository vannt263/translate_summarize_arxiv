    "our object of investigation is the process @xmath0 of _ double branching annihilating random walkers _ on the integer lattice @xmath1 .",
    "we consider finitely many positive ( @xmath2 ) and negative ( @xmath3 ) particles which are placed on the integer lattice in such a manner that subsequent particles are of opposite type .",
    "we only consider the case of an odd total number of particles .",
    "it then follows that the charge of the leftmost particle determines the overall ( signed ) charge of the whole system .",
    "the dynamics consists of two parts :    ( rw ) : :     +    particles perform a nearest neighbor random walk on the integer    lattice .",
    "( br ) : :     +    any type of particle can give birth to two offsprings of the same    type , placing them to the two neighboring lattice points , while the    branching particle changes its type to the opposite .",
    "when two particles of opposite types meet on a site they are simultaneously annihilated .",
    "this can happen both for the ( rw ) and the ( br ) steps .",
    "notice that all possible steps conserve    * the property that subsequent particles are of opposite type and * the overall charge of the system .",
    "one can look at the process @xmath0 as an _ interface _ ( boundary ) process of the _ height function _ @xmath4 . to see this , define @xmath4 on the half - integer lattice @xmath5 as the signed , spatially integrated particle number , i.e.  @xmath0 is the discrete gradient of @xmath4 . to fix the integration constant , we require that the values of @xmath4 are either `` 0 '' or `` 1 '' . as an example , @xmath4 having the heaviside configuration ( all zeros to the left and all ones to the right of the origin ) corresponds to a single positive particle of @xmath0 at the origin .",
    "figure [ fig : dbarw - intro ] demonstrates another example .    , and the corresponding height function @xmath4 . ]",
    "it follows that the dynamics described above can be translated into the language of @xmath4 as :    ( flip ) : :    ( which corresponds to * ( rw ) * ) +    a height can switch to the value of one of its neighboring heights .",
    "( excl ) : :    ( which corresponds to * ( br ) * ) +    an adjacent zero - one ( one - zero ) pair of heights can exchange values .    when only the _ spin - flip _ ( flip )",
    "jumps are present , and their jump rates are an increasing function of the number of `` 1 '' spins close by , the model is the _ voter model_. should the jump rates depend only on nearest neighbor spins , the process becomes the _ simple _ voter model . a process with only the _ exclusion _ ( excl ) steps",
    "is called a _ simple exclusion _ process . both of these models were separately under extensive studies in the past decades ( see @xcite ) .",
    "much less is known when both the ( flip ) and the ( excl ) types of steps are present in the dynamics at the same time .",
    "this is the case one is lead to with the process @xmath4 that arises from the double branching annihilating walkers @xmath0 . in the sequel we will freely switch between the equivalent descriptions of @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath0 are in the class of additive and cancellative interacting particle systems ( @xcite ) . in many cases a certain monotonicity property",
    "is violated in these sort of systems ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , pp .  380384 ) ) , making them _ non - attractive_. it is due to this lack of monotonicity that direct comparison of the processes via domination arguments is practically impossible",
    ". therefore several problems such as the question of survival or extinction are difficult to treat , and seem to be drastically sensitive to details of the considered branching mechanism ( see @xcite and further references therein ) .    _ earlier results . _",
    "double branching annihilating random walk first appeared in @xcite , where it was shown that the process dies out a.s . , providing even number of particles are present initially . in terms of @xmath4 , however , one of the first results was a hydrodynamic limit .",
    "considering simple symmetric nearest neighbor exclusion plus translation invariant and finite range dependent rates for the spin - flip jumps , a diffusive scaling leads to the following _ reaction  diffusion _ type partial differential equation : @xmath6 where @xmath7 comes from the details of the spin - flip dynamics and @xmath8 $ ] corresponds to the macroscopic density of particles ( @xcite , see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , pp .  281282 ) ) .    in @xcite positive recurrence of the heaviside configuration",
    "as seen from the leftmost `` 1 '' position was proved for a process with exclusion and asymmetric spin - flip steps , where a `` 1 '' neighboring a `` 0 '' can result in the `` 0 '' flipping into `` 1 '' but not vice - versa .",
    "this was later generalized to the symmetric spin - flip dynamics ( `` 1 '' becomes `` 0 '' as well ) in @xcite for some range of jump rate values .",
    "the nearest neighbor condition for the spin - flip dynamics was relaxed in @xcite , but these papers have not dealt with exclusion jumps .",
    "@xcite then incorporated ( long range ) exclusion jumps as well in the proof of recurrence .",
    "none of the results allowed the jump rates to depend on configuration of particles that are not involved in the jump .",
    "double branching annihilating random walk is also of main interest in the physics literature .",

    "_ motivation and results of this paper_. we first consider the nearest neighbor double branching annihilating random walk process under rather general conditions on how the walking and branching rates depend on the particle configuration .",
    "the novelty is that dependence is allowed on states far away from the position where the actual jump takes place .",
    "the motivation for this problem comes from coupling considerations of conservative nearest - neighbor non - attractive interacting particle systems .",
    "these are models where particles perform nearest neighbor jumps with rates that depend on the configuration of the initial and the destination site of the jump ; no particles are created or annihilated . the most studied versions , like the _ asymmetric simple exclusion process _",
    ", are attractive : monotonicity of the jump rates exclude the creation of _ second class particles _ that is , discrepancies between two configurations , in the basic coupling . in slightly more complicated models as e.g.  the _ zero range process _",
    "attractivity is not automatic . in non - attractive cases the basic coupling",
    "necessarily involves branching of second class particles and second class _ anti_particles in a parity - conserving manner .",
    "these can later annihilate each other .",
    "moreover , their behavior is heavily influenced by the background process of the first class ( that is , ordinary ) particles , resulting in an effective attractive potential between the second class particles .",
    "it is expected that the second class particles do not proliferate unboundedly even when their number is not conserved in interacting particle systems .",
    "this is on the level of intuition , rigorous handling of the second class particle process is currently beyond reach .",
    "however , double branching - annihilating random walks with long range dependent rates can serve as a mean - field approximation of the second class particle process , replacing the complicated background process of first class particles by a constant but attractive force between the walkers .",
    "our result is a step towards showing the non - proliferating behaviour , in this mean - field approximation .",
    "in fact , our methods go further than mere attraction . to emphasize the level of generality we mention that examples we can handle include repelling effects in the random walk dynamics as well as unbounded branching rates .",
    "as the construction of the process is far from being trivial under our weak assumptions , we first establish existence of the dynamics by showing that the configuration stays a.s .",
    "finite for all times .",
    "the main result of the paper is positive recurrence of the singleton state within our general class of long range dependent jump rates for double branching annihilating random walks .",
    "it also follows that the stationary distribution sees a finite expected number of particles .",
    "we build on methods that were developed in the case of non - dependent rates for the same problem in @xcite .",
    "these turn out to be robust enough for a significant generalization in terms of jump rate dependence .",
    "finally we extend the results for long range branching and annihilating processes . in these processes particles",
    "perform nearest neighbor , possible dependent random walk , but can put offsprings to non - nearest neighbor places in such a manner that the symmetry of the configuration space is preserved .",
    "_ organization of the paper .",
    "_ we give a precise definition of the processes of interest in section [ sec : modnot ] .",

    "we emphasize that the nonnegative rates , @xmath32 s , @xmath33 s and @xmath34 s ( @xmath35 ) , can depend on the ( relative ) position of a particle and indeed on the whole configuration of the system , that is in general they can be _ non - finite dependent _ ones . in section [ sec : results ] further regularities will be posed on these rates . under the right assumptions",
    "we will construct the process and show that it a.s .",
    "has a finite population of particles at any time , which in turn implies that the configuration space is conserved by the dynamics .",
    "some further notations : let @xmath36 and @xmath37 be the leftmost and rightmost particle position , respectively , of particles .",
    "one can assign a _ charge _ ( @xmath38 ) to a configuration @xmath39 in the following way : @xmath40 notice that in the configuration space @xmath41 this can only be either @xmath42 or @xmath43 , and agrees with the charge of the leftmost and also of the rightmost particle . notice that @xmath44 holds for every @xmath45 by the considered parity conserving branching mechanism .",
    "the _ total number of particles _ of @xmath46 is denoted by @xmath47 while the particle number process is @xmath48 .",
