    "due to several theoretical arguments ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) the interest in studying of space - time noncommutativity is growing rapidly",
    ". there appeared a lot of papers dealing with noncommutative classical ( @xcite-@xcite ) and quantum ( @xcite-@xcite ) mechanics , as well as with field theoretical models ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) , defined on quantum space - time .    at present , in accordance with the hopf - algebraic classification of all deformations of relativistic and nonrelativistic symmetries @xcite , @xcite , one can distinguish three kinds of space - time noncommutativity : +   +   1 ) canonical ( soft ) deformation @xmath8 = i\\theta_{\\mu\\nu}\\ ; , \\label{noncomm}\\ ] ] with tensor @xmath9 being constant and antisymmetric ( @xmath10 ) .",

    "its hopf - algebraic realization was proposed in @xcite , @xcite in the case of relativistic symmetry , and in @xcite , for its nonrelativistic counterpart .    in this article",
    "we investigate the impact of the mentioned above nonrelativistic deformations ( with commuting time direction ) on dynamics of simplest classical system - the nonrelativistic particle moving in a field of constant force .",
    "we indicate that in the case of soft deformation the newton equation is not modified , while for the lie - algebraic noncommutativity we recover two interesting dynamical effects .",
    "first of them corresponds to the case , when commutator of two spatial directions closes to time coordinate , and then , such a kind of noncommutativity additionally produces the acceleration of moving particle .",
    "for the second type of lie - algebraic deformation , when the commutator of spatial directions closes to space coordinates , there are generated velocity and position - dependent forces , i.e. forces , which depend on velocity @xmath14 and position @xmath15 of moving particle , respectively .    in the case of quadratic deformation",
    "the situation appears most complicated .",
    "similarly to the lie - algebraic case , this type of noncommutativity generates new velocity as well as position - dependent forces , but this time , with an explicit time - dependence . in this paper the analytic form of the corresponding solutions",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in first section",
    "we review some known facts concerning the classical mechanics on canonically deformed quantum space ( see e.g @xcite ) .",
    "we indicate that in such a case the newton equation for particle moving in a constant force remains unchanged . in section 2",
    "we analyze two cases of lie - algebraic deformations , and we provide the corresponding phase spaces as well as we solve suitable newton equations .",
    "section 3 deals with the quadratic deformation of classical space . the corresponding newton equation is provided and its solution is studied as well .",

    "the present studies can be extended in various way .",
    "first of all , one can consider more complicated system like the particle in a presence of well - known harmonic oscillator potential - see e.g. @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , due to the complicated form of the newton equations ( [ lie2newton0])-([lie2newton1 ] ) and ( [ xxlie2newton0])-([xxlie2newton1 ] ) such question appears highly nontrivial and is postponed for subsequent investigations mainly .",
    "it is also interesting to consider basic quantum systems in noncommutative space as for example the particle in a hole potential , and find their spectra in the presence of all considered deformations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
