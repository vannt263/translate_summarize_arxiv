    "the theorists are urged to gain a deep insight into rare hadronic @xmath0 meson decays , and to reduce the theoretical errors in determining the ckm parameters from the experimental data .",
    "theoretically , the nonleptonic charmless two - body @xmath0 decays have been widely discussed and carefully studied in the framework of the effective hamiltonian and factorization hypothesis .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is obtained by operator product expansion ( ope ) and the renormalization group ( rg ) method , and generally expressed as the product of the wilson coefficients and the effective operators , in forms of the four - quarks and magnetic moment operators .",
    "the wilson coefficients can be calculated reliably by the perturbation theory . in the sm , they have been evaluated to next - to - leading order@xcite .",
    "thus , the main task for us is to compute the hadronic matrix elements of the effective operators .",

    "first , the renormalization scheme and scale dependence in the hadronic matrix elements of the effective operators are apparently missed .",

    "the authors gave a comprehensive and detailed analysis for the nonleptonic two - body charmless @xmath0 decays within the frame of the generalized factorization .",
    "two year ago , beneke , buchalla , neubert , and sachrajda ( bbns ) gave a qcd factorization formula in the heavy quark limit for the decays @xmath15@xcite .",
    "they pointed out that the radiative corrections from hard gluon exchange can be systematically calculated by use of the perturbative qcd method in the heavy quark limit , i.e. , neglecting the power contributions of @xmath16 .",
    "this factorization formula can be justified in the case that the ejected meson from the @xmath14 quark decay is a light meson or an onium , no matter whether the other recoiling meson which absorbs the spectator quark in the @xmath0 meson is light or heavy .",
    "but for the case that the ejected meson is in an extremely asymmetric configuration , such as a @xmath17 meson , this factorization formula does not hold .",
    "the contributions from hard scattering with the spectator quark in the @xmath0 meson are also involved in their formula .",
    "this kind of contribution can not be contained in the naive factorization , but it appears at the order of @xmath18 .",
    "so the naive factorization can be recovered if one neglects the radiative corrections and suppressed power @xmath16 contributions in the qcd factorization .",
    "the non - factorizable contributions in the naive factorization can be calculated perturbatively , so we do not need a phenomenological parameter @xmath19 to compensate the non - factorizable effects . moreover , because the @xmath14 quark mass is not very large in reality , the potential power corrections , in particular , the chirally enhanced corrections , will play an important role in @xmath20 @xcite .",

    "the new constraint is slightly different from that derived by the other standard fit , but they are compatible with each other .    in this work , we will apply qcd factorization to all modes of @xmath0 decay into two light pseudoscalar mesons , and give a careful and detailed analysis . for the decay modes @xmath23 and @xmath10 , our work is actually a re - check of beneke _",

    "the @xmath26 has also been studied by m. z. yang and y. d. yang within the frame of qcd factorization@xcite .",
    "the differences between their work and ours are that the other type twist-3 light - cone distribution amplitude @xmath27 is taken into account , which guarantees gauge invariance of our results ; and the contributions from weak annihilation are also considered in our work .",
    "in addition , the digluon mechanism for the production of @xmath28 is taken into account in ref.@xcite .",
    "generally , it is believed that the anomalous coupling of @xmath29 can account for the large branching ratio of @xmath30 .",

    "therefore , in our work , digluon mechanism is not considered although it can enhance the branching ratio of @xmath32 . for @xmath33 ,",

    "however it is numerically very important in penguin - dominant b rare decays , such as the interesting channels @xmath82 , etc .",
    "this is because @xmath81 is always multiplied by a formally power suppressed but chirally enhanced factor @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are current quark masses .",

    "for the decays @xmath262 and @xmath263 , the cp - averaged branching ratios weakly depend on @xmath264 because that the decays @xmath265 are dominated by penguin diagrams and @xmath266 is highly suppressed by @xmath267 in the @xmath41 transition . for the case of @xmath228 , although it is a tree - dominant ( @xmath268 ) process , the penguin pollution plays an important role . for illustration",

    "( in contrast , the decay amplitude of @xmath276 suffers less pollution from the penguin contribution , which is proportional to the small electroweak penguin coefficient @xmath277 . )",
    "therefore , the variation of @xmath264 gives large uncertainty to the prediction for the branching ratio of @xmath278 .",
    "all the three modes are dominated by the form factor @xmath68 .",
    "varying @xmath68 from @xmath279 to @xmath280 , it gives about @xmath281 uncertainty to the branching ratios .",
    "by using the ratios of the branching ratios , the uncertainties caused by the form factor can be largely reduced .",
    "this will be shown later .",
    "the endpoint divergence in the hard spectator scattering does not bring large uncertainty to our predictions .",
    "the reason is that the endpoint divergence contains only a single logarithmic term and its coefficient is suppressed by @xmath18 and the color number @xmath282 .",
    "obviously , the endpoint divergence in weak annihilation causes large uncertainty , in particular , to the decays @xmath11 . in ref.@xcite",
    ", the authors also showed this point .",
    "the reason is that the endpoint divergence in weak annihilation is dominated by a product of two logarithmic terms . within the range of the parameters @xmath283 and @xmath284 , our predictions by the bbns approach",
    "are in agreement with the experimental measurements .",
    "therefore , we find that weak annihilation is the main source of the uncertainties in the bbns approach . to obtain a more precise prediction ,",
    "further analysis is needed of the weak annihilations . on the other hand ,",
    "there are other possible power suppressed corrections in the decays @xmath20 .",
    "some researchers pointed out that the elastic and inelastic long - distance fsi can help us obtain small branching ratio for @xmath285 at small @xmath5@xcite .",

    "however , all treatments to these power corrections are model - dependent . up to now",
    ", there is no systematic way to deal with these complicated nonperturbative interactions .",
    "maybe the precise measurement of the cp asymmetries for the decays @xmath20 is a chance to distinguish these models .",
    "here we emphasize that the decay amplitude of @xmath288 comes completely from the effects of weak annihilations under the bbns approach , because contributions of weak annihilations are supposed to be power suppressed , so the cp - averaged branching ratio for @xmath289 is small in fig .",

    "however , the present experimental upper limit is much greater than our predictions within the range of the parameters .",
    "if this decay mode can be measured precisely in the future , then we will be able to obtain some useful information on weak annihilations and fsi .",
