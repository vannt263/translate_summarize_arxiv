    "it was shown that the difference in cross sections is approximately 60 mb , or 4 - 6% of the reaction cross section @xmath2 .",
    "since the `` black - sphere '' model does not proved adequate framework for the calculation of reaction and interaction cross sections , we compute the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath2 using exact expressions of the glauber theory as well as expressions obtained in the optical approximation .",
    "in this section we provide expressions for the reaction , @xmath2 , and interaction , @xmath1 , cross sections and the difference between them obtained in the framework of the glauber theory . detailed derivation of these expressions can be found in @xcite .      in the glauber theory , the reaction cross section can be derived using expression for the elastic scattering amplitude . as a result",

    "first of all , we consider the phase of a - b scattering to be equal to the sum of the phases for the scattering of the nucleons of the a - nucleus on the nucleons of the b - nucleus .",
    "secondly , we assume that the 3-dimensional distribution of nucleons in projectile and target nuclei can be expressed as a product of normalized 3-dimensional single - particle densities @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are z - components of the nucleon coordinates @xmath13 since we consider forward scattering , we can integrate over longitudinal coordinates @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in this case the expression for @xmath16 as a function of impact parameter @xmath17 can be written in the following form @xmath18 \\right\\ } \\prod^b_{j=1 } \\rho_b(s_j ) \\prod_{i=1}^a du_i \\prod_{j=1}^b ds_j,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are 2-dimensional single - particle distributions of nucleons in projectile and target nuclei .    in optical approximation , the integral form of @xmath16",

    "the set of randomly generated nucleon coordinates is required .",
    "the standard mc approach calls for set of coordinates uniformly distributed in the interaction region .",
