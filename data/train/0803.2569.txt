    "the schrdinger functional ( sf ) scheme @xcite has an advantage that systematic errors can be unambiguously controlled : a unique renormalization scale is introduced through the box size to reduce the lattice artifact and a large range of the renormalization scale can be covered by the step scaling function ( ssf ) technique .",
