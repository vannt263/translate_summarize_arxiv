    "nonequilibrium systems exhibiting pattern formation are ubiquitous in nature and these patterns often emerge in the wake of a moving reaction front  @xcite . a classical example which motivated",
    "our present study is the emergence of _ liesegang bands _",
    "@xcite associated with the generic reaction scheme @xmath4 and the subsequent precipitation of @xmath0-s . in a typical experimental setup , a chemical reactant , @xmath5 ( called inner electrolyte ) , is disolved in a gel matrix , while a second reactant , @xmath6 ( outer electrolyte ) , of much higher concentration is brought into contact with the gel .",
    "the outer electrolyte diffuses into the gel , reacts with the inner electrolyte , and the reaction front moves into the gel . under appropriate conditions ,",
    "the reaction product precipitates and , depending on the geometry of the experimental setup , one can observe the emergence of families of bands or rings perpendicular to the direction of motion of the front  @xcite .",
    "this pattern formation process is a rather complex one , due to the delicate interplay between the motion of the reaction front and the precipitation dynamics of the reaction product @xmath0 .",
    "its study has a history of more than a century  @xcite and the generic , empirical laws describing it are well established  @xcite .",
    "there is still disagreement , however , about the mechanisms underlying this pattern - forming process ( see  @xcite for a comparative analysis of the existing theories ) .",
    "moreover , with the exception of the recently - proposed phase separation ( or spinodal decomposition ) scenario  @xcite , the existing theories are essentially _ qualitative _ , as they contain parameters that can not be inferred from experiments , and therefore they do not allow for _ quantitative _ predictions or for any direct comparison with the existing experimental data . having this state of affairs , we believe that it is important to test the spinodal decomposition theory in as many ways as possible .",
    "the basic ingredients of the spinodal decomposition approach are the presence of a moving reaction front and the phase separation that takes place in the wake of the front .",
    "the dynamics of the _ inert _ reaction product @xmath0 is assumed to have no feedback on the dynamics of the reagents  @xcite , thus one represents the dynamics as a _ two - stage process_. namely , ( i ) the production of @xmath0 in the moving reaction front is described by reaction - diffusion equations , while ( ii ) the diffusion and precipitation of @xmath0 particles is modelled as phase separation ( spinodal decomposition )  @xcite using the cahn - hilliard equation  @xcite , with a source term corresponding to the production of @xmath0 by stage ( i ) .",
    "all the parameters involved in this model ( including the parameters of the landau - ginzburg free energy associated with the dynamics of @xmath0 particles ) are either directly accessible experimentally or can be inferred from experimental data ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the first stage @xmath7 of the process appears in many other physical and chemical processes and has been much studied .",
    "the dynamics of the front and the spatial distribution of the rate of the production of @xmath0 ( the source for the second stage ) are known  @xcite for the case of neutral reagents @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "it should be realized , however , that @xmath6 and @xmath5 are usually electrolytes which dissociate , @xmath8 and the basic reaction process takes place between the ` active ' ions , e.g. , @xmath9 while the ` background ' ions @xmath10 and @xmath11 are not reacting . for the first sight , the background ions may be not important .",
    "they just ensure _ local electroneutrality _ and the debye screening length is much smaller than the spatial lengths involved in the macroscopic pattern formation .",
    "however , as it was shown recently  @xcite , the dynamics of the background ions may generate macroscopic effects ( even if the screening length is negligible ) and may influence both the propagation of the reaction front and the structure of the resulting pattern .",
    "thus , an obvious way to obtain more insight into the details of the dynamics of liesegang pattern formation ( with the ultimate goal of validating one theoretical scenario or another ) is to switch on an _ electric field _ and to study its effects .",
    "experimental and theoretical investigations in this direction have been going on for quite a while , see  @xcite . the emerging picture , however , might be sometimes confusing .",
    "for example , on the experimental side , das et al.s experiments  @xcite show a diffusive motion of the front for a polarity of the applied field that favors the reaction , and for a reverse polarity , as shown by sultan et al .",
    "@xcite the motion of the front acquires a supplementary drift component .",
    "these results are just the opposite of those obtained by lagzi  @xcite , however it can be argued  @xcite that in the latter case the properties of the intermediate compounds are responsible for this ` anomalous ' behavior .",
    "as far as the theories are concerned , a drift of the front is obtained analytically in e.g.  @xcite under the irrealistic assumption of the constancy of the electric field along the system , or it is put ` by hand ' as e.g. in  @xcite .    in order to clarify the effect of the electric field on liesegang patterns , we propose to revisit the problem in the framework of the spinodal decomposition theory . in the present paper , we shall concentrate on the first stage of this scenario , namely on the effect of the electric field on the motion of the reaction front and on the concentration of the reaction product @xmath0 left behind the front . as mentioned above , the problem of the first stage is more general and thus we feel that the results are of interest in their own .",
    "although we shall mention the implications of the reaction zone results for liesegang patterns , the calculations and discussions of the second stage of the process will be presented in a forthcoming study .    as it will be discussed in the next section ( sec .",
    "[ themodel ] , with some details in appendix  a ) , the new element in our model is that the dynamics of all the ions @xmath12 is followed by using reaction - diffusion equations obeying the electroneutrality condition .",
    "furthermore , the electric field is taken into account by prescribing a given potential drop between the two ends of the sample , as in real experimental situations .",
    "the equations are solved numerically in sec .",
    "[ simulations ] where , in view of the possible comparison of our results with experimental data , we concentrate our study on the _ experimentally relevant _ range of parameters and observation times .",
    "our results can be summarized by contrasting them with the fieldless case where the reaction front moves diffusively , and it leaves behind a constant concentration @xmath13 of the reaction product @xmath0  @xcite . in the presence of the electric field , the polarity of the field is an important factor .",
    "if the field favours the reaction ( in the sense that it drives the reacting ions @xmath14 and @xmath15 towards the reaction zone ) , then the motion of the reaction front remains diffusive , and the concentration of the reaction product @xmath16 increases linearly in space in the direction of the motion of the front .",
    "the diffusive front motion is in agreement with das et al.s experiments  @xcite and in contrast with theoretical conjectures about constant - velocity drifts  @xcite .",
    "an important remark is that this case is difficult to handle , since a strong electric field develops in the reaction zone ( especially for large applied tensions ) , which leads to numerical instabilities and thus restricts our numerical solutions to relatively short times .    in the case of opposite polarity of the applied field ,",
    "the motion of the reaction zone is still diffusive at short times , but a crossover to drift at large times , as seen in sultan s experiments  @xcite , can be inferred from numerical data . as far as the concentration of the reaction product",
    "is concerned , we find that at small times it decreases linearly in the direction of the motion of the front , while a slow - down of this decrease is noticed for larger times , up to the extinction of the reaction .",
    "the conclusions and the implications of the results for liesegang phenomena will be presented in sec .",
    "finally , some salient details of the problem such as the electric - field profiles , the origin of the numerical instabilities , the time evolution of the electric current , the finite - size effects , etc . are discussed in appendix  b.",
    "the experimental setup we shall consider is represented schematically in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "the two electrolytes are initially separated from each other , each is uniformly spread into a gel matrix , and the concentration of @xmath6 s is much larger than that of @xmath5 s .",
    "thus the reaction front @xmath17 moves to the right along the column",
    ". an appropriate choice of the experimental conditions ( type of reagents , concentrations , etc . ) leads to quasiperiodic precipitation of the inert reaction product @xmath0 in the wake of the moving front  the liesegang patterns , see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] . due to the presence of the gel",
    "the convection phenomena are absent , and thus the evolution of the concentration fields of the particles is accurately described by _ reaction - diffusion _ equations .     and @xmath18 are initially located in the regions @xmath19 , respectively @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "the precipitation bands , i.e. , the alternation of high - density-@xmath0 regions ( shaded areas ) and low - density-@xmath0 ones , emerge in the wake of the moving reaction front ( dashed line at @xmath21 ) . for",
    "an applied tension @xmath22 , an electric current of density @xmath23 is flowing through the system . ]",
    "our model is based on several simplifying assumptions , and we refer the reader to appendix  a for more details on a more general model .",
    "\\(i ) the first assumption is that the system is _ one - dimensional _ , which means that all the relevant quantities depend on a single spatial coordinate @xmath24 , with @xmath25 being the spatial extent of the system .",
    "this is essentially realized in practice provided that the length of the gel column is much larger than its width .",
    "the edge effects in the transverse directions might have some slight consequences ( e.g. , as reported in @xcite , in the presence of an external electric field the diameter of the tube has a small influence on the propagation of the reaction front ) .",
    "however , the final pattern is still one - dimensional to a very good accuracy .",
    "\\(ii ) we consider instantaneous _",
    "100% dissociation _ of the electrolytes @xmath6 and @xmath5 according to eq .",
    "( [ dissociation ] ) ( the assumption of  ideally strong \" acid and basis ) .",
    "correspondingly , only @xmath26 and @xmath27 ions ( and the reaction product @xmath0 ) are present in the system .",
    "\\(iii ) the ions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are reacting irreversibly with an _",
    "infinite reaction rate_. this can be justified by the fact that the characteristic time of the reaction process is @xmath28 to @xmath29 orders of magnitude less than the time scales invloved in the diffusion and precipitation processes , see , e.g. , @xcite . in this case , one has a _ pointlike reaction front _ at a time - dependent position @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "\\(iv ) the _ electroneutrality _ approximation  @xcite  according to which the local charge density is zero on space scales that are relevant to pattern formation  reads @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the charge of the @xmath32-th ion  in terms of the elementary charge @xmath33  and @xmath34 denotes its density . as discussed in detail in  @xcite , this condition is well fulfilled in the systems we are investigating .",
    "moreover , we shall consider monovalent ions , @xmath35 for all @xmath32 .",
    "\\(v ) finally , we consider _ equal diffusion coefficients _ of the ions , @xmath36 for all @xmath32 .",
    "the initial conditions for the concentration profiles @xmath37 and @xmath38 of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 ions correspond to initially separated reagents , @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "we also suppose that the concentrations of the ions are maintained fixed at the borders , @xmath41 i.e. , the system is in contact at its left and right borders with two ` infinite ' reservoirs of ions @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .    under these assumptions , the general evolution equations for the concentration profiles @xmath37 and",
    "@xmath38 of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 ions presented in the appendix  a acquire the following simplified expressions :    \\(i ) for @xmath42 ( i.e. , in the wake of the reaction front ) @xmath43    \\(ii ) for @xmath44 ( i.e. , ahead the reaction front ) @xmath45    here @xmath46 is the time - dependent electric current density @xmath47 determined by the _ constant voltage difference _",
    "@xmath48 applied between the two ends of the system @xcite .",
    "@xmath49 is faraday s constant ( i.e. , the electric charge transported by a mole of monovalent positive ions ) , @xmath50 is the universal gas constant , while @xmath51 is the temperature .",
    "finally , the local electric field is given by : @xmath52    at a first sight , one would be tempted to conclude that the equations  ( [ equations_left])([equations_right ] ) for the concentration fields look simple , but actually ( i ) they are nonlinearly coupled through the integral quantity @xmath23 , according to eq .",
    "( [ current_density ] ) , and ( ii ) they acquire _ time - dependent boundary conditions _ , @xmath53 which are complicated to handle .",
    "the meaning of these latter conditions is just that the concentrations of the reagents are zero at the front , and their flux towards the reaction front are equal .    even under the simplifying assumption presented above , an analytic solution for the concentration profiles of the ions and thus for the motion of the front seems hopeless .",
    "we thus turned to numerical solutions , whose main results are presented in the following section .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , we decided to focus our analysis on situations that are experimentally relevant .",
    "in particular , although we are aware of different other regimes that might appear , we restrict the presentation to the ones that are most likely to appear in experiments .",
    "the choice of the parameters intends thus to mimic real experimental situations , namely , we considered concentrations of the ions @xmath54 and @xmath55 of the order @xmath56 m ",
    "@xmath57 m , lengths of the system @xmath58 of some tenths centimeters , and tensions @xmath22 applied between system s edges such that the corresponding field intensity @xmath59 varies between @xmath60 v / m .",
    "the common diffusion coefficient of the ions was chosen as @xmath61 m@xmath62s for all the calculations . finally , times of observation of the system that vary between a few hours and some tenth days .",
    "note that this observation time corresponds to the real experimental time and _ not _ to the time required by the numerical calculations .",
    "as far as the actual numerical calculations are concerned , we integrated the partial differential equations ( [ equations_left])([equations_right ] ) using a fourth - order runge - kutta integration scheme in time and a first - order differenciation procedure in space .",
    "we shall generally present the results that were obtained for a polarity @xmath63 of the applied field that favors the reaction , i.e. , that drives the @xmath14 and @xmath15 ions towards the reaction zone .",
    "this is the case that is apriori more interesting for the formation of the liesegang pattern .",
    "however , this situation is numerically difficult , since a strong electric field develops rapidly ( especially for large applied tensions ) in the reaction zone , thus leading to the appearance of numerical instabilities which limit the observation time . for more details on this point",
    "see appendix  b.    we also indicate the main results for the opposite polarity of the electric field , for which the production of @xmath0 is slowed down and finally stopped .",
    "this is a situation that becomes rather rapidly uninteresting from the point of view of the pattern formation .      in the limit of an infinite reaction rate ,",
    "the reaction zone reduces to a point whose position @xmath21 is moving to the right in the experimental setup of fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "the main result of the simulations we carried on for the case of the field favoring the reaction is that the motion of the front is _ diffusive _ with an effective diffusion coefficient @xmath64 , @xmath65 the above statement is valid as far as the border effects are negligible ( see below ) and for the parameter domains that are experimentally relevant .",
    "this result is in agreement with the rather accurate experimental results of das et al .",
    "@xcite , but contradicts some previous theoretical considerations @xcite which , however , in our opinion , have no justification .",
    "figure  [ figure2 ] shows the trajectory of the reaction front for various tensions @xmath59 applied to the system . a first remark would be that the effect of the electric field on front s motion is _ very small_. one",

    "the values of the other parameters are : @xmath66 cm , @xmath67 cm , @xmath68 m , and @xmath69 m. the observation time is limited to @xmath70 hours ( see the main text ) . ]",
    "we had to limit the observation times for these large tensions to @xmath70 hours , because of the numerical instabilities already invoked above .",
    "of course , for smaller tensions one can go to longer observation times , like e.g. , in figs .",
    "[ figure4 ] and  [ figure5 ] .",
    "a look at the concentration profiles of the ions , see fig .",

    "[ figure4 ] . a qualitative comparison of figs .",
    "[ figure2 ] and [ figure4 ] shows that @xmath64 is much more sensitive to changes in the concentration ratio @xmath74 than to changes in the applied field @xmath59 .    .",

    "the observation time is @xmath57 days . ]",
    "the finite spatial extent of the system does not affect the diffusive behavior of the front until the reaction front reaches the very vicinity of the borders",

    "however , for the usual observation times we are dealing with , this regime of the front is not relevant , see appendix  b for more details .",
    "we come now to the most important results from the point of view of the subsequent pattern formation through precipitation of @xmath0 .",
    "namely , the study of the influence of the applied electric field on the production of @xmath0 in the wake of the moving front .",
    "as well - known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , in the absence of an applied electric field the concentration of @xmath0 left behind the reaction front is constant , and its value @xmath13 is determined by the initial concentrations of the ions @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and by their diffusion coefficients . in the particular case of equal diffusion coefficients @xmath77 of the ions , its value is given by : @xmath78 where @xmath79 , and the diffusion coefficient @xmath64 of the front is given by eq .",
    "( [ dfront ] ) .    when an electric field is applied to the system , the concentration of @xmath0 left behind the moving reaction front _",

    "this fact , in conjunction with the diffusive motion of the front , leads to a density of @xmath0 in the wake of the front @xmath91 i.e. , a linear increase with @xmath24 .",
    "the regime of constancy of the current density @xmath46 is discussed in more details in the appendix  b. it is maintained as long as the total electric resistance of the system is practically constant .",

    "we did not describe them in the main text , in order to make the essential results more transparent .",
    "however , we think they may put supplementary light on our conclusions , as well as on some controversial points of previously published results .      this section intends to strengthen the conclusion presented in the main text , namely that the finite - size effects do not influence the motion of the front as long",
    "as this one does not ` hit ' the right border .",
    "this reinforce also the idea that the factors responsible of front s motion are _",
    "strictly local_.    in fig .",
    "[ figure9 ] we considered three system sizes and observed the long - time behavior : ( i ) for the smallest system the front hits the right border during the simulation time ; ( ii ) for the intermediate system the front starts to ` feel ' the border at the end of the simulations ; ( iii ) in the the longest system , the front is unaffected by the borders during the simulation time .",
    "note however the very long time required to see such border effects even for the shortest system ( about @xmath128 minutes for a system with @xmath129 of only @xmath57 cm ) . in",
    "most of the real experiments ( for which both the system length is bigger  of at least a few tenths centimeters  and the observation time is usually smaller  a few days ) , as well as in most of our simulations , this slowing - down regime of the front is practically _",
    "never attained_.      for a constant applied tension",
    "@xmath22 the current density @xmath46 is a function of time only ; it is a _",
    "global _ quantity , being determined by an integral over the entire system involving the instantaneous concentration fields .",
    "consequently , @xmath23 is sensitive to finite - size effects all along its evolution .",
    "the different regimes of @xmath23 result essentially from the interplay between the _ evolving _ relative electric resistances of the _ depletion zone _ and that of the rest , ` unperturbed part ' of the system .",
    "the depletion zone is defined as the region where the concentrations of the ions are significantly smaller than their initial values .",
    "this region expands progressively , more or less rapidly ( depending on the applied tension ) around the moving reaction front .",
    "it can develop , of course , up to the size that is allowed by the borders of the system .",
    "it is a region of higher resistivity than the ` unperturbed ' part of the system .",
    "there are two elements ( with distinct temporal evolution ) that determine the electric resistance of the depletion zone , namely ( i ) its spatial extent and ( ii ) its degree of depletion , i.e. , the concentrations of the ions in the region .",
    "note that the resistivity of the unperturbed part of the system is determined by its spatial extent , which equals @xmath130 minus the length of the depletion zone .    at the initial stages ,",
    "the spatial extent of the depletion zone is small as compared to the rest of the system , and the concentrations of the ions are not extremely low yet .",
    "therefore , its contribution to the electrical resistance of the column is negligible ; during this stage , the resistance of the column is essentially constant and determined by the ` unperturbed ' part of the system . consequently , one obtains an initial _ regime of constant current density_. this can be observed in fig .",
    "[ figure10 ] , from which one also realizes that this is actually the regime that is _ accesible experimentally _ , and thus the only of interest to us .     as a function of time ( logarithmic scale ) for various system sizes  the same systems as those in fig .",

    "the values of the other parameters are : @xmath68 m , @xmath69 m , and applied electric field @xmath126 v / m .",
    "the observation time is of @xmath127 hours . ]",
    "although we shall not concentrate on them further ( as not relevant for the typical experimental domains ) let us briefly describe the other regimes that can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figure10 ] , in the final part of the simulations .",
    "\\(i ) for the shortest system , the depletion zone can not develop significantly before the front reaches the right border .",
    "then the current passes directly from the constant - value regime to a rapid increase .",
    "when the front is in the vicinity of the border , the right - hand ( with respect to the front ) high - resistivity region of small concentration of the ions reduces progressively in size , while there is an advancement , behind the front , of a region of low - resistivity , high ion concentrations .",
    "this generates a decrease in the resistance of the system , and thus the observed increase in the current density .",
    "\\(ii ) for the intermediate and the longest system , the depletion region has more time to develop . at a certain time",
    "( shorter for the intermediate system ) , the electric resistivity of the depletion zone becomes comparable to that of the rest of the system .",
    "then a transient regime starts  seen as an increase in @xmath131 for both systems .",
    "finally , the increasing resistivity of the depletion zone becomes dominating in the system , causing a monotonous decrease in the current density @xmath131 .",
    "however , the intermediate system does not ` have time ' to develop this regime further : it hits the border and starts the corresponding increase in @xmath131 , according to the mechanism sketched at point ( i ) above .",
    "a longer time simulation ( not shown here ) for the longer system shows a continuation of this regime , with @xmath132 .",
    "the electric field is not constant along the system , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ figure11 ] , in contradiction with the fundamental assumption in @xcite .",
    "this can be easily understood by inspection of eq .",
    "( [ efield ] ) , taking into account that the concentration fields vary along the system . for a polarity of the externally applied tension @xmath22 that favors the reaction , the absolute value of the electric field increases rapidly in the vicinity of the moving front .",
    "this effect is due to the decrease in both the the concentrations of the reacting ions @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( due to the reaction ) , and the concentrations of the background ions @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( because the polarity of the electric field pushes them away from the reaction zone ) . as a result ,",
    "the sum in the denominator of the expression  ( [ efield ] ) determining the electric field @xmath133 becomes small in the vicinity of the reaction front , and thus the local field becomes very large .     at two times and for two different values of the electric field @xmath59 applied to the system : ( a ) @xmath59 = 5 v / m ( b ) @xmath59 = 15 v / m .",
    "the values of the other parameters are : @xmath66 cm , @xmath67 cm , @xmath68 m , and @xmath69 m. ]    this rapid  both _ spatial and temporal _ , see fig .",
    "[ figure11 ]  increase in the electric field renders the numerical procedure unstable after some time .",
    "the other element that contributes to this instability is also connected with the small densities of the ions around the reaction zone : namely , from one integration step to another , the local concentration profiles may acquire unphysical negative values .",
    "these instabilities develop faster for larger applied tensions ; their appearance can be delayed by decreasing both the spatial and temporal discretization steps .",
    "one is thus limited in the choice of the upper value of the applied tension @xmath22 by a ` reasonable ' choice of the spatial and temporal discretization steps , that allow the study of the system for time intervals that are physically relevant . from a technical point of view",
    ", these instabilities are promptly notified by the value of the electric field at the reaction point , that acquires an unphysical temporal evolution at the moment of the onset of the instabilities .",
    "the appearance of these numerical instabilities can be also postponed by : ( i ) giving up the infinite dissociation rate approximation , and allowing the @xmath6 and @xmath5 electrolytes to diffuse towards the reaction zone and to supply it with ions @xmath26 and @xmath27 through dissociation ; ( ii ) taking into account the finiteness of the reaction rate @xmath109 between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , that leads to a slower decrease of the concentration of the reacting ions in the reaction zone . note that in this case the reaction zone acquires a finite spatial extent ( i.e. , it is no longer reduced to a single point ) .",
    "finally , we should mention in connection with the electric field that , in real systems , this one has supplementary inhomogeneities related to the geometry of the system and , furthermore , the electric stability of the gel column may also reduced by electric effects at the walls of the container  @xcite .",
    "the concentration profiles @xmath134 of the ions have a very complex evolution , that is determined by their diffusion coefficients , the initial concentrations , the length of the system , and the applied electric tension .",
    "a systematic presentation of all the corresponding effects would be tedious , and thus we shall present below only a few relevant elements .    for a given system ( i.e. , with fixed parameters ) ,",
    "a qualitative typical temporal evolution of the concentration profiles corresponds to a reduction of the concentration of the ions in the vicinity of the moving reaction front , as well as to a progressive extension of this depletion zone ( which , recall , is defined as the region where the concentrations of the ions are significantly smaller than their initial values ) ; of course , as long as permitted by the boundaries , on which the concentrations of the ions are fixed .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure12 ] .",
    "this depletion effect is more pronounced when the polarity of the applied tension is such that it favors the reaction than in the case of the opposite polarity .",
    "this can be easily understood : in an electric field that favors the reaction , not only the disappearance of the ions @xmath14 and @xmath15 is favorized through reaction , but also the background ions @xmath10 and @xmath11 are pushed away from the reaction zone .",
    "of course , in a field of reverse polarity , the nonreacting ions @xmath10 and @xmath11 are pushed towards each other , and the active ions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are pushed away from each other ( and thus their consumption through reaction is reduced ; this leads , in the end , to an extinction of the reaction ) .    finally , for a polarity of the applied tension that is favorable to the reaction , the expansion of the depletion zone is more rapid and pronounced for larger tensions",
    "this determines the local increase of the electric field , and , in the long time , the numerical instability of the integration procedure ( as discussed in the previous subsection ) .",
    "for the regime of constant @xmath46 , as discussed in the main text , the concentration of the reaction product @xmath16 increases linearly with @xmath24 with a slope proportional to the fieldless value @xmath13 , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ figure13 ] .     left behind the reaction front for different values of the concentration @xmath55 .",
    "the observation time is @xmath136 hours .",
    "the values of the parameters of the system are : @xmath66 cm , @xmath67 cm , fixed ratio @xmath137 , and the applied electric field @xmath59 = 5 v / m . ]",
    "this initial behavior of the production of @xmath0 is determined by and lasts as long as the initial regime of constancy of the current density @xmath46 , and therefore _ it is the only regime on which we focus in our study_. however , as discussed above in the corresponding subsection , the current density @xmath46 may develop other regimes ( if allowed by the size of the system ) .",
    "then , of course , these regimes will be reflected by the production of @xmath0 . in particular , the transient increase ( if any ) in @xmath131 between the initial regime of constancy and the regime @xmath138 is reflected by a transient increase in the production of @xmath0 ( a  bump \" in the profile @xmath16 ) . the regime @xmath138 itself leads to a constant deposition of @xmath0 in the wake of the front ; the plateau value of @xmath84 varies with @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( much in the same way as @xmath13 ) , but is rather insensitive to the applied tension @xmath22 . finally , when the reaction front ` hits ' the right border , there is a great increase in the production of @xmath0 at the border .",

    "this research has been partly supported by the swiss national science foundation and by the hungarian academy of sciences ( grants no .",
