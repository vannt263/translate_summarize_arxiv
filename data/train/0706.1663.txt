    "independent observations have confirmed that the universe is presently undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "although the introduction of a cosmological constant into the field equations seems to be the simplest theoretical approach to generate a phase of accelerated expansion , several alternative candidates have been proposed in the literature , ranging from dark energy models to modified theories of gravity . amongst the latter ,",
    "models generalizing the einstein - hilbert action have been proposed .",
    "a nonlinear function of the curvature scalar , @xmath0 , is introduced in the action given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the matter action .",
    "we consider @xmath4 throughout this work , for notational simplicity .",
    "varying the action with respect to @xmath5 provides the following field equation @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "note that the ricci scalar is now a fully dynamical degree of freedom , which is transparent from the following relationship @xmath8 obtained from the contraction of the modified field equation ( [ field : eq ] ) .",
    "one may generalize the action ( [ action ] ) by considering an explicit coupling between an arbitrary function of the scalar curvature , @xmath9 , and the lagrangian density of matter @xcite .",
    "note that these couplings imply the violation of the equivalence principle @xcite , which is highly constrained by solar system tests .",
    "one may also mention alternative approaches , namely , the palatini formalism @xcite , where the metric and the connections are treated as separate variables ; and the metric - affine formalism , where the matter part of the action now depends on the connection and is varied with respect to it @xcite .",
    "a fundamental issue extensively addressed in the literature is the viability of the proposed @xmath0 models @xcite . in this context , it has been argued that most @xmath0 models proposed so far in the metric formalism violate weak field solar system constraints @xcite , although viable models do exist @xcite ( static and spherically symmetric solutions have also been found @xcite ) .",
    "the issue of stability @xcite also plays an important role in the viability of cosmological solutions @xcite . in ref . @xcite it was argued that the sign of @xmath10 determines whether the theory approaches the general relativistic limit at high curvatures , and it was shown that for @xmath11 the models are , in fact , stable .",
    "the stability of the de sitter solution in @xmath0 gravity has also been extensively analyzed in the literature @xcite .",
    "recently , @xmath0 models which have a viable cosmology were analyzed , and it was found that the models satisfying cosmological and local gravity constraints are practically indistinguishable from the @xmath12cdm model , at least at the background level @xcite . note that to be a viable theory , the proposed model , in addition , to simultaneously account for the four distinct cosmological phases , namely , inflation , the radiation - dominated and matter - dominated epochs , and the late - time accelerated expansion @xcite , should be consistent with cosmological structure formation observations @xcite . in the latter context",
    ", it has been argued that the inclusion of inhomogeneities is necessary to distinguish between dark energy models and modified theories of gravity , and therefore , the evolution of density perturbations and the study of perturbation theory in @xmath0 gravity is of considerable importance @xcite .",

    "the einstein static universe has recently been revived as the asymptotic origin of an emergent universe , namely , as an inflationary cosmology without a singularity @xcite .",
    "the role of positive curvature , negligible at late times , is crucial in the early universe , as it allows these cosmologies to inflate and later reheat to a hot big - bang epoch",
    ". an attractive feature of these cosmological models is the absence of a singularity , of an ` initial time ' , of the horizon problem , and the quantum regime can even be avoided .",
    "furthermore , the einstein static universe was found to be neutrally stable against inhomogeneous linear vector and tensor perturbations , and against scalar density perturbations provided that the speed of sound satisfies @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "further issues related to the stability of the einstein static universe may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite    in this work we have analyzed linear homogeneous scalar perturbations around the einstein static universe in the context of @xmath0 modified theories of gravity .",
    "we have considered two specific forms of @xmath0 and found the stability regions of the solutions for the scale factor perturbation . the first case considered , namely , @xmath21 , was motivated by the fact that , in principle , @xmath22 dominates for high curvatures which is expected in the early universe .",
    "secondly , we considered the case of @xmath23 , which is known to generate a late - time accelerated expansion phase @xcite , and has been used in the weak - field limit , as now the @xmath24 term dominates for low curvatures .",
    "the stability regions were parameterized by an equation of state parameter @xmath1 , and it was found that in the context of @xmath0 modified theories of gravity the range of the parameter is greatly enhanced relatively to the results obtained in general relativity .",
    "however , in both cases we analyzed , the equation of state parameter was strictly negative , an issue which we hope to overcome in future work by considering other modified gravity models . these results are consistent with the condition @xmath58 , for the stability of cosmological models @xcite .    concluding , we have found that the modified einstein static universe , with a positive cosmological constant and matter described by the equation of state , @xmath60 , can be stabilized against homogeneous perturbations , contrary to classical general relativity .",
    "therefore , we are lead to conclude that , in principle , stable modified gravity solutions , which are unstable in general relativity @xcite , do indeed exist . that this is actually possible relies on the fact that the perturbations of the metric couple to the matter perturbations , see our eq .",
