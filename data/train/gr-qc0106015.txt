    "binary black holes have been the subject of numerous studies in the past two decades , both from the analytical and numerical point of view .",
    "these studies are motivated by the fact that the coalescence of two black holes is expected to be one of the strongest sources of gravitational waves detectable by the interferometric detectors ligo , geo600 , tama300 and virgo , currently coming on - line @xcite .    from the analytical point of view",
    ", the most recent works are based on the post - newtonian formalism ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) or on the effective one - body approach developed by buonanno and damour @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the black holes are treated as point mass particles , which is a very good approximation when the black holes are far apart . for closer configurations ,",
    "one may turn instead to some numerical approach .",
    "the numerical studies can be divided in two classes : ( i ) the initial value problem for two black holes ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) and ( ii ) the time evolution of the initial data ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review and refs .",
    "@xcite for recent results ) .",
    "one of the major problems in this respect is to get physically relevant initial data . indeed ,",
    "initial data representing two black holes have been obtained long ago by misner @xcite and lindquist @xcite , as well as brill and lindquist @xcite ( a modern discussion of these solutions can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite or appendices a and b of ref .",
    ". however these solutions correspond to two momentarily _ static _ black holes and are therefore far from representing some stage in the evolution of an isolated binary black hole in our universe .",
    "based on the seminal work of bowen and york @xcite , kulkarni , shepley and york @xcite have described a procedure to get initial data representing binary black hole with arbitrary positions , masses , spins and momenta .",
    "this procedure , known as _",
    "conformal imaging _ , has been used by cook and other authors @xcite to numerically construct 3-dimensional spacelike hypersurfaces representing these initial data .",
    "these solutions constitute some generalization to the non - static regime of the misner - lindquist solution @xcite , the spacelike hypersurface having the same topology : two isometric asymptotically - flat sheets connected by two einstein - rosen bridges .",
    "also based on the bowen and york s work @xcite , another approach , the so - called _ puncture method _",
    ", has been undertaken by brandt and brgmann @xcite and used recently by baumgarte @xcite .",
    "the resulting solutions also have arbitrary positions , masses , spins and momenta but their topology is different from that of the conformal - imaging approach : the spacelike hypersurface has now _ three _ asymptotically - flat sheets , which are not isometric .",
    "these three sheets are connected among themselves by two einstein - rosen bridges ; one of the sheets contains two throats and is supposed to represent our universe .",
    "these solutions hence constitute some generalization to the non - static case of the brill - lindquist solution @xcite . both the conformal - imaging and the puncture approaches assume that the metric of the spacelike hypersurface is conformally flat .",
    "a third approach to the problem relaxes this assumption ; it has been developed recently by matzner , maroronetti and collaborators @xcite .",
    "these authors use a linear combination of two boosted kerr - schild metrics as the conformal 3-metric in york s treatment of initial conditions @xcite .",
    "the main drawback of the three approaches described above is that they contain freely specifiable parameters , related to the values of positions , momenta and spins of the black holes , and it is difficult to figure out which parameters correspond to a physical configuration .",
    "in particular , it is not obvious at all how to select , among all these configurations , those that correspond to binary black holes on closed circular orbits . of course",
    ", the circular orbits are approximate representations of the exact orbital motion , which is inspiralling due to the loss of energy and angular momentum via gravitational radiation . however in the regime where the radiation reaction time scale is much longer than the orbital time scale , i.e. before the last stable orbit , we expect that the binary system can be approximated by a sequence of tighter and tighter circular orbits .",
    "note that the gravitational radiation reaction makes initially elliptic orbits become circular @xcite .",
    "it is thus legitimate to search for such orbits .",
    "this problem has been addressed by cook @xcite and pfeiffer et al .",
    "@xcite within the conformal - imaging approach and by baumgarte @xcite within the puncture approach ( see e.g. @xcite for a review of these computations ) . although they differ in the topology of the spacelike hypersurface ( two - sheeted for @xcite against three - sheeted for @xcite ) , both sets of studies rely on the _ effective - potential method _ proposed by cook @xcite .",
    "this method amounts to defining the binding energy by a somewhat ad - hoc formula , and to define the angular velocity of a circular orbit by minimizing the binding energy with respect to the angular momentum at fixed total energy and separation .",
    "this method can be criticized on the following ground : the only well defined global quantities on an asymptotically flat spacelike hypersurface are the adm total mass @xmath0 and adm total linear momentum .",
    "the latter can be chosen to be zero without any loss of generality . with some restrictions on the asymptotic gauge , the total angular momentum @xmath1",
    "can also be defined @xcite . defining the binding energy",
    "would require the notion of individual mass for each hole , let say @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in order to set @xmath4 .",
    "however there does not exist any unique definition of the individual masses @xmath2 and @xmath3 for a binary black hole . in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors define @xmath2 and @xmath3 via the formula which relates the mass of a kerr black hole to its horizon area and its angular momentum .",
    "however such a formula is strictly demonstrated only for a isolated rotating black hole ( kerr spacetime ) .",
    "in particular , it does not take into account any tidal effect .",
    "our approach for finding circular orbits of binary black holes is very different : instead of considering 3-dimensional spacelike hypersurfaces , we adopt from the very beginning a 4-dimensional point of view , i.e. we consider a full spacetime containing two moving black holes . of course",
    ", in order to make the problem tractable , we introduce some approximations , the most significant being the assumption of strictly circular orbits , which amounts to endowing our spacetime with a killing vector field ( helical symmetry ) .",
    "an interesting pay - off is that the orbital angular velocity @xmath5 can be unambiguously defined as the rotation rate of the killing field with respect to some asymptotically inertial observers .",
    "this definition does not suffer from the ambiguity of the 3-dimensional approaches and is made possible only because we have re - introduced _ time _ in the problem .",
    "the presentation of this new approach is organized as follows .",
    "we set up the problem in sec .",
    "[ s : formulation ] , starting from the explicit construction of the spacetime manifold , introducing a metric , as well as a corresponding isometry on it , and finally imposing the helical symmetry .",
    "the einstein equations are then considered in sec .",
    "[ s : einstein ] , first in their general form and then after the assumption of a conformally flat 3-metric .",
    "global quantities such as the adm mass and the total angular momentum are discussed in this section , as well as the virial prescription for the orbital velocity .",
    "section  [ s : asymptotic ] deals with the asymptotic behavior of the shift vector and the extrinsic curvature tensor and discusses the connection between helical symmetry and asymptotic flatness .",
    "finally sec .",
    "[ s : conclu ] contains the concluding remarks .",
    "we consider the spacetime to be a differentiable manifold @xmath6 with the topology of the real line @xmath7 times the misner - lindquist manifold @xcite .",
    "more precisely , for any couple of positive numbers @xmath8 and any couple of real numbers @xmath9 such that @xmath10 , let us consider the subset of @xmath11 obtained by removing the interior of balls of radius @xmath12 and @xmath13 and center @xmath14 and @xmath15 : : = \\ { ( x , y , z ) , ( x - x_1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 a_1 ^ 2    ( x - x_2)^2 + y^2 + z^2 a_2 ^ 2 }  .",

    "we have chosen a spacetime manifold with spatial sections of the misner - lindquist type , i.e. composed of two isometric asymptotically flat sheets . moreover , we have chosen the black holes to be corotating , which has the simple geometrical interpretation of the throats being killing horizons .    by enforcing the isometry conditions on the shift vector , as well as the equation relating the trace of the extrinsic curvature to the divergence of the shift , possibly at the price of slightly modifying the momentum constraint ,",
    "all the quantities which enter in the equations remain regular .",
    "notably the extrinsic curvature tensor remains finite on the throats , although the lapse vanishes there .",
    "we have proposed to compute the orbital angular velocity of the system by requiring that the conformal factor @xmath165 and the lapse function @xmath83 have the same monopolar @xmath205 term in their asymptotic expansions .",
    "this requirement reduces to the classical virial theorem at the newtonian limit .",
    "contrary to previous numerical approaches  the conformal imaging one @xcite and the puncture one @xcite  our method amounts to solving five , and not four ( the four constraints ) , of the einstein equations .",
    "this reflects the fact that we have re - introduced the time dimension in the problem .",
    "the formulation presented here has been implemented by means of a numerical code based on a multi - domain spectral method and we present the first results in the companion paper @xcite .",
    "these results can be used as initial data for computing the black hole coalescence within the 3 + 1 formalism @xcite .",
    "let us stress that the work presented in this article constitutes a first attempt to tackle the problem of binary black hole in circular orbits . in order to fully specify the problem and",
    "search for a unique solution , we had to make a number of concrete choices which have some degree of arbitrariness , such as the two - sheeted topology , the isometry across the throats and the resulting boundary conditions , or the rigid rotation of the black holes .",
