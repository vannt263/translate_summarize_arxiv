    "the many - body problem of quantum field theory , in spite of great efforts in the past , still remains unsolved and there is a need for genuine nonperturbative methods .",
    "in @xcite we have proposed a connected ( equal - time ) green function approach for su(n ) gauge theories which might provide valuable insight into the low energy qcd problem .",
    "however , the possible truncation schemes in the order of the connected green functions will be limited for practical purposes and one thus needs intrinsic criteria that allow for a judgement of the convergence properties of the approach especially in those cases , where exact solutions are not available .    before adressing the su(n )",
    "yang - mills problem , we analyze the convergence properties of the correlation dynamical approach for the scalar quantum field theory with @xmath3 self - interaction , which has become an important theoretical laboratory for testing non - perturbative methods .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that @xmath4-theory provides an easy framework for studying different scenarios in nonperturbative renormalization when going from @xmath0 to @xmath1 @xcite-@xcite , @xmath2 @xcite-@xcite and @xmath5 @xcite-@xcite space - time dimensions .    in two preceding articles",
    "@xcite we have investigated ground state symmetry breaking and the effective potential in @xmath4-theory in @xmath1 and @xmath2 space - time dimensions using the equal - time correlation dynamics method ( in @xmath6-dimensional @xmath4-theory denoted as @xmath7 ) , which consists in a coupled set of equations of motion for connected equal - time green functions .",
    "this coupled set of equations is obtained by inserting the cluster expansion , i.e. the expansion of full green functions in terms of connected green functions , into the equations of the bbgky hierarchy and by neglecting all connected @xmath8-point functions with @xmath9 for some given @xmath10 .",
    "the derivation of the correlation dynamical equations for @xmath4-theory has been presented in detail in @xcite ; the resulting equations in @xmath1 dimensions are given by eqs .",
    "( 20)-(31 ) in appendix a of @xcite and in @xmath2 dimensions by eqs .",
    "( 19)-(21 ) in sect .",
    "2 as well as eqs . ( 28)-(36 ) in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "the equations in @xmath0 dimensions can easily be obtained from those in higher dimensions by discarding the dependence on the spatial coordinates and by omitting all mass counterterms . for a more general discussion of correlation dynamics in case of nonrelativistic fermionic systems we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite .    the calculations in @xcite aimed at the evaluation of the effective potential @xmath11 , which is given by the minimum of the energy expectation value in the subspace of states with a fixed expectation value of the scalar field @xmath12 .",
    "since the @xmath7-equations describe the ( equal - time ) evolution of the system for a given initial condition , a direct ( variational ) evaluation of the effectiv potential within this approach would amount to minimizing the energy in the manifold of stationary solutions with the constraint @xmath12 . in practice , however , this turns out to be impossible because the energy is not bounded from below without additional constraints , since the solution manifold contains unphysical green functions .",
    "although e.g. for the @xmath0-dimensional case in the 2-point approximation a sufficient constraint can be derived from the uncertainty relation , it is not yet clear what constraints for higher order approximations have to be imposed .",
    "the computation of the effective potential and the corresponding lowest energy state green functions within our approach is therefore carried out by means of a dynamical calculation using the gell - mann and low theorem , i.e. by adiabatically changing the parameters of the theory in time from a configuration with a well known lowest energy state solution to the actual configuration of interest as described in @xcite . whereas this many - body scheme was found to converge quite rapidly in case of nonrelativistic nuclear physics problems @xcite , it is not clear if this also holds for the quantum field theoretical case .",
    "we thus have to explore the convergence of the cluster expansion and its dependence on the parameters of the theory , i.e. the coupling @xmath13 and the expectation value of the scalar field @xmath12 .",
    "before investigating @xmath4-theory in @xmath1 and @xmath2 space - time dimensions , we turn to the simpler case of @xmath0 space - time dimensions , which is equivalent to the quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator in case of a positive squared mass and to the quantum mechanical double - well potential in case of a negative squared mass . since in @xmath0 dimensions we have access to the exact lowest energy state solution for given @xmath14 , we here can also directly control the validity of the correlation dynamical solution .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ nullpluseins ] we investigate the @xmath0-dimensional case in full detail with respect to the problem of degenerate vacua and quantum tunneling , whereas in sect .",

    "[ summary ] concludes the present study with a brief summary of our results , while technical details of the cluster expansion as well as the gep ( gaussian effective potential ) approximation are given in appendices [ clusterexpansion ] to [ gep ] .",
    "in @xmath0 space - time dimensions and with the identification @xmath15 , @xmath16 , the lagrangian of @xmath4-theory with positive squared mass @xmath17 ( anharmonic oscillator ) reads @xmath18 while the hamiltonian is given by @xmath19 with the usual equal - time commutation relation @xmath20=i$ ] .    in case of a negative squared mass @xmath21 ( double - well potential )",
    "we write the lagrangian and the hamiltonian as @xmath22 and @xmath23    since we are aiming at the effective potential , i.e. the properties of the system not only as a function of the coupling @xmath13 , but also as a function of @xmath24 , we explicitly split off the vacuum expectation value by writing @xmath25 and treat @xmath26 as a constant classical background field which can be varied as an external parameter .",

    "we recall that in the correlation dynamical calculation the 1-point functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 are set equal to zero according to ( [ splitoff ] ) , and for each value of @xmath26 an individual time dependent calculation has to be carried out .",
    "we have used a linear time dependence of the form @xmath53 or @xmath54 , respectively , where @xmath55 in each case has been chosen sufficiently small such that the system shows adiabatic convergence as long as @xmath26 is outside the domain where the exact solution indicates a breakdown of the cluster expansion .",

    "we note that the sharp peaks for certain values of @xmath56 or @xmath57 in fig .",
    "[ nulleinscorrelationstrength ] result from a change of sign of @xmath58 .",
    "in the case of the double - well potential the exact solution ( upper left part of fig .",
    "[ nulleinscorrelationstrength ] ) yields a dramatic sudden change in the relative importance of the connected green functions at a value of @xmath59 . above @xmath60",
    "the relative importance of the connected green functions decreases by at least one order of magnitude as one goes from @xmath8 to @xmath61 , implying an excellent convergence of the cluster expansion .",
    "in contrast to that , in the region below @xmath60 the full green functions are dominated by their connected parts , i.e. the system is dominated by fluctuations .",
    "the corresponding result in @xmath45-approximation ( upper right part of fig .",
    "[ nulleinscorrelationstrength ] ) above @xmath60 shows nearly the same result as the exact solution .",
    "this has been expected due to the excellent convergence of the cluster expansion in this region .",
    "the sudden rise in the relative importance of the higher order connected green functions in going from @xmath62 to @xmath63 , however , is smeared out over an extended region for the finite value of @xmath55 taken in the calculation .",
    "however , it becomes evident that as soon as the connected green functions dominate the full green functions ( @xmath64 ) , the method of time dependently switching on the residual interaction within the @xmath45-approximation breaks down .",
    "in contrast to the results for the double - well potential , the ratios ( [ nullpluseinsstaerke ] ) for the anharmonic oscillator ( lower two pictures in fig . [ nulleinscorrelationstrength ] ) demonstrate a good agreement between the exact solution and the @xmath45-solution for all @xmath57 .",
    "the relative importance of the connected green functions increases with decreasing @xmath57 , but even at @xmath65 the higher order full green functions can in a good approximation be expressed by their disconnected parts ( note that @xmath66 as @xmath67 by definition ) .    in order to understand the numerical results for the double well potential in fig .",
    "[ nulleinscorrelationstrength ] in a more qualitative way , we now examine the wave functions obtained by the exact solution for the system .",
    "we first note that instead of finding the lowest energy state in the subspace of all states with given @xmath14 , one can equivalently introduce a source term into the hamiltonian by writing @xmath68 and then find the ground state of the system with respect to the whole hilbert space .",
    "the resulting state , which has some vacuum expectation value @xmath69 depending on the source @xmath70 , is also the lowest energy state in the subspace with given @xmath69 .    in fig .",
    "[ wellenfunktion ] we display the absolute square of the ground state wavefunction @xmath71 and the wavefunction of the first excited state @xmath72 of the hamiltonian ( [ nulleinsquellhamilton ] ) with @xmath73 as a function of @xmath74 and @xmath75 where both wavefunctions have been obtained via diagonalization of ( [ nulleinsquellhamilton ] ) . at @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    "have approximately the same shape with maxima at @xmath79 .",
    "we note that in the limit @xmath80 the double - well potential develops an infinitely high barrier at @xmath81 .",
    "this leads to a spectrum of the hamiltonian for @xmath82 which consists of pairs of degenerate eigenvalues . due to the infinite barrier at @xmath81",
    "there is no more tunneling between the 2 orthogonal states spanning the eigenspace corresponding to each eigenvalue .",
    "the lowest energy states of the system then are of the form @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 denoting the mutually orthogonal lowest energy solutions with @xmath86 and @xmath87 , i.e. the optimally localized  left  and  right ",
    "states which can be constructed from an appropriate superposition of the degenerate ground states .",
    "we then obtain @xmath88\\ ] ] with @xmath89 ; states of the form ( [ mixphase ] ) thus restore the convex shape of the effective potential by making it flat between @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "as soon as @xmath92 , the system will energetically prefer to shift its ground state wavefunction completely to one side of the potential barrier , depending on the sign of @xmath70 . in other words ,",
    "the system with an infinitely high potential barrier undergoes a phase transition from the state @xmath84 to the state @xmath85 as @xmath70 passes through zero .",
    "here we use the term  phase transition  for any discontinuous behaviour of the lowest energy solution with respect to the parameters of the hamiltonian .    if @xmath93 assumes a finite ( but still small ) value as in case of fig .",
    "[ wellenfunktion ] , the pairwise degeneracy of eigenvalues disappears due to tunneling ",
    "which is no longer forbidden for finite @xmath13  but the spectrum still consists of pairs with a small energy gap .",
    "the separation of the lowest eigenvalues @xmath94 can be taken as a measure of the inverse tunneling time .",
    "the region between @xmath90 and @xmath91 then can be covered by a very small variation of @xmath70 , i.e. the above obtained  phase transition  from @xmath84 to @xmath85 at @xmath82 in case of a finite coupling is smeared out into a sharp crossover . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ wellenfunktion ] , the ground state wavefunctions are ( to a very good approximation ) still of the form ( [ mixphase ] ) , with only slight modifications due to tunneling .",
    "the first excited state of the system then is given by the eigenstate corresponding to the higher eigenvalue in the lowest lying pair , i.e. approximately by @xmath95 in fig .",
    "[ wellenfunktion ] , this can be seen from the fact that the relative strengths of the left and right maxima of @xmath78 and @xmath77 depend on @xmath96 in exactly the opposite way .    for @xmath97",
    "the system suddenly changes its behaviour and the ground state and the first excited state are localized states , which to a good approximation can be described as the ground state and the first excited state of the harmonic oscillator potential obtained in second order taylor expansion of the classical potential around its minima , as can also be observed in fig .",
    "[ wellenfunktion ] .",
    "this corresponds to the single phase localized configuration at finite @xmath70 in the limiting case of the infinitely high potential barrier .",
    "we arrive at the conclusion that for a finite , but small value of @xmath93  although the system does not exhibit true ground state symmetry breaking due to tunneling ",
    ", it will still qualitatively behave like a system which is in a ( non - localized ) two phase configuration for @xmath98 and in a ( localized ) single phase configuration for @xmath99 .",
    "it is now straightforward to show analytically , that the cluster expansion has to break down in a two phase configuration according to ( [ mixphase ] ) as soon as it shows good convergence in both optimally localized single phase configurations .",
    "furthermore , in a field theory with an arbitrary space - time dimensionality , the cluster decomposition property of the connected green functions , @xmath100 is lost in a state constructed according to ( [ mixphase ] ) whenever @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the optimally localized states in case of a system with ground state symmetry breaking . for the @xmath0",
    "dimensional system this has no direct implication for equal - time green functions since it only applies to the time arguments , e.g. in a time ordered green function .",
    "taking into account the above considerations , we can now identify @xmath91 , the expectation value of @xmath101 in the optimally localized right state , with @xmath102 , for which ( [ nullpluseinsstaerke ] ) ( cf .",
    "the upper left part of fig .",
    "[ nulleinscorrelationstrength ] ) shows a relatively sharp rise . in the correlation dynamical calculation ( displayed in the upper right part of fig .",
    "[ nulleinscorrelationstrength ] ) , the sharp rise is smeared out .",
    "we also observe that the region , in which the system is dominated by fluctuations , only extends up to @xmath103 instead of @xmath104 for the exact solution .    in order to get an explanation for this behaviour",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ idealmaxwell ] a qualitative picture of the external source @xmath70 as a function of @xmath26 for 3 different cases . in case",
    "( 1 ) ( dashed line ) , there is no ground state symmetry breaking and for each value of @xmath70 there is a unique value @xmath69 . in case",
    "( 2 ) , furthermore , we have the situation corresponding to the convex shape of the effective potential given by the construction of nonlocal states ( [ mixphase ] ) in case of ground state symmetry breaking , where for any nonzero value of @xmath70 there is a unique value @xmath69 and for @xmath82 all values between @xmath90 and @xmath91 are accessible .",
    "this corresponds to the field theoretical maxwell construction @xcite , where the two phases , given by the left and the right optimally localized state in ( [ mixphase ] )  coexist  . in case",
    "( 3 ) we still have ground state symmetry breaking , but the curve for @xmath105 is analytically continued into the region , where the field theoretical maxwell construction takes place , implying that no phase coexistence is allowed here .    due to the non - ergodicity of a system , that posesses 2 phases without tunneling in between , the trajectory of case ( 3 ) is realized in any time dependent adiabatic process as used in our correlation dynamics approach for the computation of the effective potential .",
    "this results in a good convergence of the cluster expansion throughout the whole process , because the system always stays in a localized state . for the double - well potential with finite potential barrier",
    "this is e.g. realized within the @xmath106-limit , i.e. the time - dependent hartree - fock method , because at this level of approximation tunneling is not yet included . the adiabatic limit of the @xmath106 solution then simply is the gep solution , i.e. the lowest energy gaussian .",
    "however , for a system with tunneling between the 2 phases we come to the conclusion that the convergence properties of the cluster expansion with respect to the adiabatic computation of the lowest energy state are determined by the relative magnitude of 2 timescales : the specific tunneling time @xmath107 and the time @xmath108 over which the system is propagated ; the latter quantity in our case is always chosen to ensure sufficient adiabatic convergence in the single phase region .",
    "the tunneling time for a given system itself depends on the correlation dynamical truncation scheme ; as indicated above , @xmath107 is always infinite within the 2-point truncation scheme and the inclusion of higher order connected green functions will in general tend to decrease it .    if @xmath109 , a dynamical phase mixing will be negligible and our correlation dynamics will give useful results for the dynamical time evolution of the system . in the two phase region , however , the system will no longer propagate along an adiabatic trajectory of lowest energy . loosely speaking",
    ", the correlation dynamical time evolution will generate states of lowest energy in the  subspace of sufficiently localized states  , the latter of course not being mathematically well defined .    on the other hand , for @xmath110 tunneling will lead to a breakdown of correlation dynamics in the course of the time integration .",
    "this is the reason for the breakdown of the @xmath45 approach for @xmath111 in the upper right part of fig .",
    "[ nulleinscorrelationstrength ] .    in order to investigate the behaviour of our double - well system with respect to the different time scales in a manner directly related to the idealized picture given in fig .",
    "[ idealmaxwell ] , we now choose a different dynamical process , in which the background field @xmath26 is changed as a function of time . for the initialization at @xmath112 we make use of the fact that for @xmath113 ( strong field limit ) the system approaches the classical limit ; there again the gep solution can be taken as a starting configuration even though the residual interaction is completely taken into account in the time propagation right from the beginning .    we then compute the corresponding external source @xmath70 as a function of @xmath26 by imposing the hellmann - feynman theorem ( which of course strictly only holds for an exact eigenstate of the system ) @xmath114 where @xmath115 is given by ( [ nulleinsquellhamilton ] ) . inserting ( [ nulleinsquellhamilton ] ) into ( [ feynmanhellmann ] )",
    "yields @xmath116 with @xmath117 we obtain @xmath118 relating the external source @xmath70 to the effective potential in the usual way .",
    "the philosophy behind this definition of @xmath105 within a dynamical calculation is the interpretation already indicated above , that for @xmath109 the system will  quasi - adiabatically  evolve in the subspace of localized ( single phase ) states .    in fig .",
    "[ realmaxwell ] the external source @xmath70 is plotted as a function of @xmath57 in @xmath45-approximation for a double - well potential with @xmath73 , where @xmath26 has been changed in time according to @xmath119 .",
    "the fat solid line is the result in @xmath106-approximation with @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) , which essentially lies on top of the gep result and is shown for comparison . for large values of @xmath122 the trajectory in the @xmath123plane",
    "can be computed down to @xmath124 without any problem and exhibits the same qualitative behaviour as the trajectory of case ( 3 ) in fig .",
    "[ idealmaxwell ] , indicating that for @xmath125 we have @xmath126 .    by reducing @xmath122",
    "we get into the region where @xmath127 .",
    "the inclusion of higher order connected green functions then allows for tunneling , thus leading to a breakdown of the dynamical time propagation due to the dominance of fluctuations in the phase coexistence regime .",
    "with decreasing @xmath122 , the value of @xmath26 , at which this breakdown happens , shifts towards the point where @xmath70 changes sign ( @xmath128 ) . in the exact solution this value corresponds to the boundary of the phase coexistence region ( cf .",

    "a simple qualitative argument @xcite pointing towards the suppression of tunneling in higher space - time dimensions is the following : consider a bubble of phase 1 within a region of phase 2 .",
    "the surface region of this bubble then has a higher energy density than the surrounding . in @xmath1 dimensions ,",
    "the surface region is given by the environment of the two end - points of the bubble interval ( the soliton and the antisoliton ) and its size is therefore independent of the size of the bubble ; consequently the bubble can expand without increasing the total energy of the system .",

    "in this work we have explored the convergence properties of the cluster expansion approach and presented criteria within the theory itself , that allow to conclude about its convergence also in those cases , where the exact solution is not known . as an example we have studied scalar theories with quartic self coupling in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 dimensions .",

    "the @xmath4 theory in @xmath0 dimensions is equivalent to a quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator for positive squared mass and a quantum mechanical double - well potential for negative squared mass . in the case of an anharmonic oscillator with @xmath161",
    "we obtained a good convergence of the cluster expansion as well as an excellent agreement between the exact solution and the correlation dynamical solution ; this could be explained by the fact that the system is in a single phase ( localized state ) configuration .    in case of an extreme double - well potential with @xmath73 the cluster expansion in the exact solution breaks down as soon as the ground state for a given expectation value @xmath162",
    "can approximately be described by a maxwell construction , i.e. by a coherent superposition of two single phase configurations .",
    "the shrinking of the region with dominant fluctuations within the correlation dynamical calculation could be traced back to the fact , that the time @xmath108 , chosen according to the requirement of an adiabatic propagation in the single phase region , is small compared to the tunneling time @xmath107 of the system for certain values of @xmath162 .",
    "our analysis for the qft systems in @xmath1 and @xmath2 dimensions demonstrated , that even in the phase coexistence ( non - localized state ) region , i.e. for coupling constants higher than the critical coupling for ground state symmetry breaking , the correlation dynamical approach yields a good convergence of the cluster expansion . here ,",
    "the tunneling times within our dynamical calculation are infinite or at least very large compared to the time required for an adiabatic propagation ; this behaviour is traced back to the fact that tunneling is suppressed in @xmath1 dimensions and probably absent in @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "the main result of this article can therefore be summarized as follows : the applicability of correlation dynamics ( which is based on an expansion in terms of connected green functions ) to the adiabatic computation of the lowest energy state with given field expectation value is given if a ) the exact stationary solution is a single phase , and b ) if the required propagation time for adiabatic or ",
    "[ nullpluseins ] ) convergence is small compared to the tunneling time .",
    "this is in fact the case in higher space - time dimensions since there tunneling is progressively suppressed .",
    "this is not only important for lowest energy state calculations as carried out in this article , but also for applications of correlation dynamics to the nonequilibrium dynamics of systems with phase transitions .",
    "furthermore , the relative ratios ( [ stark2]-[stark4 ] ) provide an intrinsic test of the correlation dynamical method also for those field theoretical problems , where the exact solution is not known .",

    "analogously we obtain @xmath173 @xmath174 @xmath175 @xmath176 the expressions for equal - time green functions are obtained by taking the well - defined equal - time limit which yields the appropriate operator ordering in the cluster expansions .",

    "the explicit forms of the cluster expansions of @xmath182 , @xmath183 ( required for our analysis in @xmath0 dimensions ) are given in appendix [ xhochn ] .",

    "the connection to the field theoretical hartree - fock - bogoliubov ansatz becomes obvious by noting , that ( [ quasivac ] ) is the quasiparticle vacuum with respect to bogoliubov - transformed creation and annihilation operators . keeping this last point in mind",
