    "the lhc has recently observed a new scalar particle with a mass around @xmath11 gev that could be consistent with the higgs boson of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , a study of the combined tevatron data has revealed a smaller broad excess corresponding to a mass between 115 gev and 135 gev @xcite which is consistent with this lhc discovery . with more data collected ,",
    "the lhc is expected to be able to unveil the detailed properties of the new scalar particle and verify its nature .    from the theoretical side ,",
    "there has been a collective effort in the past decades in the search for new physics beyond the sm , that can address some of the fundamental unresolved questions in particle physics .",
    "one simple candidate that was extensively studied in the past several years is the so called sm4 ( also referred to as  naive \" or ",
    "simple \" sm4 ) ; the sm with a fourth sequential generation of fermions ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "this simple extension of the sm was studied for addressing some of the challenges in particle physics , such as : the hierarchy problem @xcite , the origin of matter - anti matter asymmetry in the universe @xcite and the apparent anomalies in flavor physics @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the recent lhc searches for the sm4 heavy 4th generation quarks have now pushed the exclusion limits to @xmath12 gev for the @xmath13 and @xmath14 gev for the @xmath15 @xcite , which is on the border of their perturbative regime . moreover , the sm4 higgs was already excluded in the mass range @xmath16 gev by the 2011 data @xcite when @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the above reported discovery of a light higgs with a mass around 125 gev is not compatible with the sm4 that includes a heavy 4th generation neutrino with a mass @xmath18 gev , i.e. , with a mass larger than the current lower bound on @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "in fact , it was further pointed out recently in @xcite that the interpretation of the measured higgs signals is not consistent with the sm4 also for the case @xmath20 . in particular , in the sm4 , the leading gluon - fusion light higgs production mechanism is enhanced by a factor of @xmath21 due to the contribution of diagrams with @xmath5 and @xmath22 in the loops @xcite , which in general leads to larger signals ( than what was observed at the lhc ) in the @xmath23 channels . however ,",
    "if the 4th generation masses are of @xmath24 gev , then the decay channels @xmath25 are suppressed due to nlo corrections @xcite , and the exclusion of the sm4 is based mainly on the @xmath26 channel . in the @xmath27 channel",
    "there is also a substantial suppression of @xmath28 due to ( accidental ) destructive interference in the loops @xcite and another @xmath28 factor due to nlo corrections @xcite .",
    "when @xmath29 is taken to be light enough so that @xmath30 becomes @xmath31 , then the @xmath32 channel becomes further suppressed to the level that the observed excess can no longer be accounted for @xcite .",
    "for a recent comprehensive analysis of the sm4 status in light of the latest higgs results and electroweak precision data ( ewpd ) , we refer the reader to @xcite",
    ".    however , as was noted already 20 years ago @xcite and more recently in @xcite , if heavy 4th generation fermions are viewed as the agents of electroweak symmetry breaking ( and are , therefore , linked to strong dynamics at the nearby tev - scale ) , then more higgs particles are expected at the sub - tev regime . in this case , the higgs particles may be composites of the 4th generation fermions and the low - energy composite higgs sector should resemble a two ( or more ) higgs doublet framework . indeed , the phenomenology of multi - higgs 4th generation models was studied recently in @xcite and within a susy framework in @xcite , for a review see @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was also shown that the current exclusion limits on the sm4 @xmath5 and @xmath22 could be significantly relaxed if the four generations scenario is embedded in a 2hdm framework .",
    "adopting this viewpoint , i.e. , that the 4th generation setup should be more adequately described within a multi - higgs framework , we will study in this paper the expected higgs signals of a 2hdm with a 4th generation family , investigating whether the interpretation of the recently measured 125 gev higgs properties are consistent with one of the neutral scalars of the 4th generation 2hdm .",
    "the 2hdm structure has an inherent freedom of choosing which doublet couples to which fermions .",
    "for the three generations 2hdm , three popular setups were suggested which are usually referred to as type i , type ii and type iii 2hdm . in the case",
    "where the 2hdm is assumed to underly some form of tev - scale strong dynamics mediated by the 4th generation fermions , we expect the higgs composites to couple differently to the 4th generation fermions .",
    "this can be realized in a class of 2hdm models named the 4g2hdm , suggested in @xcite .",
    "most of our analysis below is performed in this 4g2hdm framework and a comparison to a 2hdm of type ii ( which also underlies the susy higgs sector ) with and without 4th generations will also be discussed .",
    "let us recapitulate the salient features of the 2hdm frameworks with a 4th generation of fermions ( we will focus below on the quarks sector , but a generalization to the leptonic sector is straight forward ) . assuming a common generic 2hdm potential , the phenomenology of 2hdm s is generically encoded in the texture of the yukawa interaction lagrangian . the simplest variant of a 2hdm with 4th generations of fermions , can be constructed based on the so called type ii 2hdm ( which we denote hereafter by 2hdmii ) , in which one of the higgs doublets couples only to up - type fermions and the other to down - type ones .",
    "this setup ensures the absence of tree - level flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) and is , therefore , widely favored when confronted with low energy flavor data .",
    "the yukawa terms for the quarks of the 2hdmii , extended to include the extra 4th generation quark doublet is : @xmath33 where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) are left(right)-handed fermion fields , @xmath36 is the left - handed @xmath37 quark doublet , @xmath38 are general @xmath39 yukawa matrices in flavor space and @xmath40 are the higgs doublets : @xmath41    as mentioned above , motivated by the idea that the low energy scalar degrees of freedom may be the composites of the heavy 4th generation fermions , @xcite have constructed a new class of 2hdm s , named the 4g2hdm , that can effectively parameterize 4th generation condensation by giving a special status to the 4th family fermions .",
    "the possible viable variants of this approach can be parameterized as @xcite :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 are the two higgs doublets , @xmath44 is the identity matrix and @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) are diagonal @xmath39 matrices defined by @xmath47 .",
    "in particular , in the type i 4g2hdm of @xcite ( which we will focus on below and which will be denoted hereafter simply as the 4g2hdm ) , one sets @xmath48 , so that the  heavier \" higgs field ( @xmath49 ) is assumed to couple only to the 4th generation quarks , while the  lighter \" higgs field ( @xmath50 ) is responsible for the mass generation of all other ( lighter 1st-3rd generations ) fermions .",
    "the yukawa interactions for these 4g2hdm models in terms of the physical states were given in @xcite .",
    "for the lighter cp - even higgs it reads :    @xmath51 \\right\\ } q_j h \\label{sff1}~ , \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath52 is mixing angle in the cp - even neutral higgs sector , @xmath53 is the ratio between the vevs of @xmath54 and @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 are new mixing matrices in the down(up)-quark sectors , which are obtained after diagonalizing the quarks mass matrices .",
    "these matrices are key parameters of the model , which depend on the rotation ( unitary ) matrices of the right - handed down and up - quarks , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and on whether @xmath60 and/or @xmath61 are  turned on \" : @xmath62 thus , as opposed to  standard \" 2hdm s , in the 4g2hdm some elements of @xmath58 and @xmath59 are physical and can , in principle , be measured in higgs - fermion systems .",
    "in particular , inspired by the working assumption of the 4g2hdm and by the observed flavor pattern in the up and down - quark sectors , it was shown in @xcite that , for @xmath48 , the new mixing matrices @xmath56 and @xmath57 are expected to have the following form : @xmath63 and similarly for @xmath56 by replacing @xmath64 . the new parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 are free parameters of the model that effectively control the mixing between the 4th generation and the 3rd generation quarks .",
    "we therefore expect @xmath67 , so that a natural choice for these parameter would be @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( see also @xcite ) . in what follows we will thus set @xmath70 and vary the @xmath3 mixing parameter in the range @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72    clearly , once a new higgs doublet is introduced , the phenomenology of the higgs particles production and decays becomes more complicated .",
    "in particular , the new yukawa couplings depend on several more parameters ( i.e. , in the 4g2hdm on @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath73 and @xmath52 ) and the cp - even higgs couplings to the @xmath74 and to the @xmath75 bosons have extra pre - factors of @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( the pseudoscalar @xmath10 does not couple at tree - level to the @xmath74 and the @xmath75 ) . as a result",
    ", the one - loop @xmath78 decay and the leading @xmath79 higgs production mechanism can be significantly altered compared to their sm and sm4 values , depending on @xmath65 , @xmath73 , @xmath52 and on the 4th generation fermion masses ( i.e. , assuming @xmath67 , therefore setting @xmath80 throughout our analysis ) .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ hgg ] , where we plot the widths @xmath81 and @xmath82 , as a function of these three parameters setting @xmath83 gev .",
    "the dependence on @xmath84 is depicted in a narrow range around @xmath85 , for which the 4g2hdm is consistent with both ewpd @xcite and with the observed 125 gev higgs signals ( see below ) .",
    "we see that both @xmath78 and @xmath86 have a strong dependence on the higgs mixing angle @xmath52 , while @xmath78 is also very sensitive to @xmath84 and to the new @xmath3 mixing parameter @xmath65 , due to their role in the interference between the fermion loops and the w - boson loop . in fig .",
    "[ br_h ] we further plot the various relevant branching ratios of a 125 gev @xmath0 in the 4g2hdm , as a function of @xmath52 for @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 gev .",
    "let us now turn to the recently reported lhc higgs searches and the implications of the discovery of a 125 gev higgs - like particle on the 4g2hdm setup with a 4th generation of fermions .",
    "the quantity that is usually being used for comparison between the lhc and tevatron results and the expected signals in various models is the normalized cross - section : @xmath90 for the observed ratios of cross - sections , i.e. , the signal strengths @xmath91 , and the corresponding errors @xmath92 , we use the latest results as published in @xcite :    * @xmath7 : @xmath93 ( taken from @xmath94 * @xmath95 : @xmath96 * @xmath97 : @xmath98 * @xmath99 : @xmath100 * @xmath101 : @xmath102 * @xmath103 : @xmath104    @xmath105    @xmath106    the values given above are the result of a combination of the most recent data in each channel.@xmath107}$ ] the uncertainties are calculated by treating the reported experimental uncertainties as statistical and assigning 15% theoretical uncertainty to the gluon fusion production mechanism and 5% theoretical uncertainty on electroweak production mechanisms and on the branching fractions @xcite .",
    "one can easily notice that the channels which have the highest sensitivity to the higgs signals and contributed the most to the recent 125 gev higgs discovery are @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "in all other channels the results are not conclusive and at this time they are consistent with the background only hypothesis at the level of less than @xmath110 .    clearly , a sm higgs is ideally most consistent with @xmath111 in every channel , while in other models we expect some deviations in the various measured channels , depending on the parameters of the model and on the mass of the scalar candidate which should be compatible with the lhc results .",
    "thus , the comparison to any given model can be performed using a @xmath112 fit : @xmath113 where @xmath92 are the errors on the observed cross - sections and @xmath114 is the calculated normalized cross - section in any given model . in particular , we take advantage of the fact that @xmath115 , and calculate @xmath114 using @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the higgs production mechanism , i.e. , either by gluon fusion @xmath118 , vector boson fusion @xmath119 or the associated higgs - w production @xmath120 at the tevatron .",
    "the higgs signals in a 2hdm setup with a 4th generation of fermions have already been discussed to some extent in the literature @xcite , but with no general picture of how these signals match all the observed higgs cross - sections reported above . here",
    ", we try to quantify how well the 2hdm scenarios ( where the lightest higgs particle , @xmath0 , has a mass of 125 gev ) fit all the available higgs data , by calculating the @xmath112 for all the relevant channels in two 2hdm realizations with four generations - the 2hdmii and the 4g2hdm ( see section [ sec2 ] ) .",
    "we use the latest version of hdecay @xcite , with recent nlo contributions which also include the heavy 4th generation fermions , where we have inserted all the relevant couplings of the 4g2hdm and the 2hdmii frameworks described in section [ sec2 ] . for the 4th generation fermion masses involved in the loops of the decays @xmath121 ( i.e. , in the 1-loop nlo corrections for the cases @xmath122 ) , we have used the approximation of a degenerate 4th generation fermion sector , where we have tested below two representative cases : @xmath123 and @xmath124 gev ( the effect of mass splittings between 4th generation fermions on @xmath125 is negligible ) .",
    "it is important to note that , while the first case ( @xmath89 gev ) is excluded for the sm4 @xcite , it is not necessarily excluded for the 4g2hdm , since in this model the decay patterns of @xmath5 and @xmath22 can have a completely different topology , e.g. , having @xmath126 , for which the current limits ( which are based on the  standard \" sm4 decays @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) do not apply , see @xcite .    as mentioned earlier , we find that the simple sm4 case , with a 125 gev higgs is excluded to many @xmath129 s when confronted with the higgs search results . also ,",
    "as was already noted in @xcite in the context of the  standard \" 2hdmii ( i.e. , with four generations ) , we find that the simplest case of a light 125 gev pseudoscalar @xmath10 of any 2hdm , with and without a 4th family , is not compatible with the higgs data , irrespective of the 4th generation fermion masses . in particular , the signals of the 125 gev higgs decaying into a pair of vector bosons , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , excludes this possibility due to the absence of tree - level @xmath132 and @xmath133 couplings .",
    "we , therefore , focus below only on the case where the observed 125 gev higgs - like particle is the lighter cp - even higgs , @xmath0 .",
    "we plot in fig .",

    "the  standard \" 2hdmii setup with @xmath138 gev is also found to be consistent with the higgs data in a narrower range of @xmath139 .",
    "we find that the fit favors a large @xmath3 mixing parameter @xmath65 , implying @xmath140 which completely changes the @xmath5 decay pattern @xcite and , therefore , significantly relaxing the current bounds on @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "this can be seen in table [ tab1 ] where we list 6 representative sets of best fitted values ( to be used in the plots below ) for @xmath142 in the 4g2hdm , that correspond to points on the best fitted 4g2hdm curves shown in fig .",

    "evidently , our conclusions above do not change after adding the ewpd constraints to the analysis .",
    "finally , we note that we have also tested the 3 generations type ii 2hdm and found that its lightest cp - even higgs is also a good candidate for the observed 125 gev higgs particle , giving a fit which is also comparable to the sm fit for @xmath1 .",

    "we see that appreciable deviations from the sm are expected in the channels @xmath101 , @xmath7 and @xmath146 .",
    "in particular , the most notable effects are about a @xmath147 deviation ( from the observed value ) in the vbf diphoton channel @xmath148 and a @xmath149 deviation in the @xmath101 channel .",
    "the deviations in these channels are in fact a prediction of the 4g2hdm strictly based on the current higgs data , which could play a crucial role as data with higher statistics becomes available .",
    "they can be understood as follows : the channels that dominate the fit ( i.e. , having a higher statistical significance due to their smaller errors ) are @xmath150 .",
    "thus , since the @xmath79 production vertex is generically enhanced by the @xmath151 loops , the fit then searches for values of the relevant 4g2hdm parameters which decrease the @xmath152 decays in the appropriate amount .",
    "this in turn leads to an enhanced @xmath101 ( i.e. , due to the enhancement in the @xmath79 production vertex ) and to a decrease in the @xmath7 and @xmath153 , which are independent of the enhanced @xmath154 vertex but are sensitive to the decreased @xmath155 one .",

    "we see that @xmath169 gev is excluded by the current data in the @xmath170 channel for points p1 , p2 , p3 and p5 ( i.e. , @xmath171 for @xmath169 gev ) , while for point p4 and p6 @xmath172 gev is allowed .",
    "the current cms and atlas higgs data in the @xmath158 and @xmath159 channels are not sensitive to the pseudoscalar @xmath10 , due to the absence of a tree level @xmath132 and @xmath133 coupling ( and due to the smallness of the corresponding @xmath132 and @xmath133 one - loop couplings @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the only relevant search channels which are currently sensitive to the @xmath10 decays are @xmath173 and @xmath174 , for which a search for the higgs was performed up to a higgs mass slightly below @xmath175 by both cms and atlas . defining the signal strengths for the @xmath10 signals as : @xmath176 we plot in figs .",

    "<S> we interpret the recent discovery of a 125 gev higgs - like state in the context of a two higgs doublets model with a heavy 4th sequential generation of fermions , in which one higgs doublet couples only to the 4th generation fermions , while the second doublet couples to the lighter fermions of the 1st-3rd families . </S>",
    "<S> this model is designed to accommodate the apparent heaviness of the 4th generation fermions and to effectively address the low - energy phenomenology of a dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the physical higgs states of the model are , therefore , viewed as composites primarily of the 4th generation fermions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the lightest higgs , @xmath0 , is a good candidate for the recently discovered 125 gev spin - zero particle , when @xmath1 , for typical 4th generation fermion masses of @xmath2 gev , and with a large @xmath3 mixing in the right - handed quarks sector . </S>",
    "<S> this , in turn , leads to @xmath4 , which drastically changes the @xmath5 decay pattern . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that , based on the current higgs data , this two higgs doublet model generically predicts an enhanced production rate ( compared to the sm ) in the @xmath6 channel and a reduced @xmath7 and @xmath8 ones . finally , the heavier cp - even higgs is excluded by the current data up to @xmath9 gev , while the pseudoscalar state , @xmath10 , can be as light as 130 gev . </S>",
    "<S> these heavier higgs states and the expected deviations from the sm in some of the higgs production channels can be further excluded or discovered with more data . </S>"
