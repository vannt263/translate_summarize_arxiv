    "the effects of diffusion are profound . the electron - electron ( _ e - e _ ) scattering amplitudes , for example , develop non - analytic corrections that result in enhanced correlations at low energies@xcite . it has been shown that rg theory applied to a weakly disordered system is able to capture this scale ( energy or temperature ) dependence to all orders in the _ e - e _ scattering amplitudes , making it the most promising analytical technique available to understand the physics of disordered systems .",
    "( pedagogical reviews of the rg theory can be found in ref.@xcite . )",
    "weak disorder implies that @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the fermi - energy .",
    "typical high mobility two - dimensional semiconducting devices have very small fermi - energies with a scattering rate which is even smaller due to the very high mobility of the samples making it very difficult to access the diffusive region at experimentally reasonable temperatures .",
    "si - mosfets on the other hand have only moderately high mobilities so that @xmath4 is of the order of a kelvin while @xmath3 is of the order of a few kelvin .",
    "the impurity scattering in these inversion layers is short - ranged in character making quantum scattering the dominant scattering mechanism , while semi - classical effects arising from the impurity potential landscape are negligible at low temperatures . for these reasons ,",
    "as noted in the beginning , rg theory has been particularly successful in describing the properties of electrons in silicon inversion layers .",
    "( see ref.@xcite for how the diffusive regime is identified experimentally and for a quantitative comparison of theory with experiment . )",
    "the conduction band of an @xmath5-(001 ) silicon inversion layer has two almost degenerate valleys located close to the @xmath6-points in the brillouin zone@xcite . the abrupt change in the potential at the interface , which breaks the symmetry in the @xmath7-direction perpendicular to the 2d plane , leads to the splitting of the two valleys .",
    "although intervalley scattering originates from both impurity scattering and scattering due to _ e - e _ interactions , the imperfections at the interface , which are distributed on the atomic scale , are the main source of the large momentum transfer @xmath8 in the @xmath7-direction needed for intervalley scattering .",
    "the rg theory developed in ref.@xcite considered the valley degrees of freedom to be degenerate and distinct , hence quantitative comparisons with experiments performed in ref.@xcite were limited to temperatures larger than the valley splitting , @xmath9 , and the intervalley scattering rate , @xmath10 , both scales being sample dependent .",
    "this paper develops the relevant scaling equations in the presence of valley splitting and intervalley scattering .",
    "the scaling equations are presented in three different temperature regimes : ( i)high temperature region , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 , ( ii)low temperature region , @xmath15 , ( iii)and intermediate temperature region , @xmath16 .",
    "the last of the three regions is relevant when the band splitting is large so that effective mixing of the valleys due to impurity scattering occurs only at sufficiently low temperatures ; it is shown that the standard two - parameter description has to be modified in this case to include a third scaling variable which has quantitative effects at finite temperature but does not affect the asymptotic conclusions of the two - parameter theory .",
    "electrons in valleys can be conveniently labeled using additional valley indices @xmath17 .",
    "( for our purpose , the number of valleys @xmath18 located at @xmath19 , where @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the lattice constant of silicon . )",
    "this increases the number of single particle states to ( spin)@xmath22(valley)=4 .",
    "since the diffusion modes , responsible for the relaxation of density and spin perturbations ( and valley in our case ) in a disordered system at long times and distances , formally occur via particle - hole excitations , the corresponding number of ( particle)@xmath23(hole ) diffusion modes equals 16 .",
    "this is a four fold increase from the case of one valley and has significant quantitative effects on transport as shown in ref.@xcite . at low temperatures ,",
    "some of these modes develop gaps ( cut - offs ) proportional to @xmath9 and @xmath24 and are therefore ineffective ( non - singular ) for @xmath25 below the characteristic temperature scales @xmath26 and @xmath12@xcite , leading to quantitatively different scaling as the temperature is varied .       in eq.([eqn",

    "the properties of the intra- and intervalley impurity scatterings are defined in eq.([eqn : uv ] ) , represented here by single and double dashed lines , respectively . ]    .",
    "[ fig : tau ]    at low electron densities the mobility of a 2deg is determined by the charged centers within the sio@xmath27 layer .",
    "due to the short - ranged nature of the impurity scattering in silicon inversion layer structures , the drude relation for the mobility , @xmath28 , gives a direct measure of the single particle life - time , @xmath29 .",
    "here , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the charge and the effective mass of the electron , respectively .",
    "ando@xcite argued that the mobility is also determined partially by the intervalley scattering rate . to this end , the two different scattering rates , that is , the intravalley and intervalley rates , can be incorporated by introducing two scattering potentials@xcite , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the potential @xmath32 is slowly varying on the scale of @xmath34 if the impurities in the oxide layer is uniformly distributed , while @xmath33 is a rapidly oscillating function with momentum of the order of @xmath34 .",

    "the fluctuations in the diffuson channel , @xmath39 , have a diffusive singularity @xmath40 .",
    "finite valley splitting and intervalley scattering introduces gaps in @xmath39 thus cutting off the singularity .",
    "the different diffuson modes involving fluctuations in the valley occupations are shown in fig.[fig : diffuson ] .",
    "the details of their derivation are given in appendix[app : diffuson ] .",
    "we start by defining the elementary diffuson blocks , @xmath41 and @xmath42 shown in fig.[fig : diffuson ] .",
    "the diffuson blocks @xmath43 are insensitive to valley splitting since both the particle and the hole ( corresponding to the top and bottom lines with arrows moving to the right and left , respectively ) belong to the same valley .",
    "the @xmath44 index for the @xmath42 diffuson indicates the valley index of the particle , with the hole being in the @xmath45 valley ; the two valleys are nonequivalent for finite @xmath9 . in appendix[app : diffuson ] , the equations satisfied by the diffuson propagators are solved in the limit of weak splitting @xmath46 .",

    "the gaps in this limit correspond to @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in this weak scattering limit , relevant to high - mobility mosfets , the form of the diffusons obtained in eqs.([eqn : app_dpm ] ) and ( [ eqn : app_dperptau ] ) reduce to : ( the overall factor @xmath56 is suppressed )    [ eqn : diffusons ] @xmath57    where @xmath58 .",

    "the amplitudes are easily generalized to include the valley degrees of freedom .",
    "they are shown in fig.[fig : gamma ] .",
    "note that the intervalley scattering amplitudes @xmath61 and @xmath62 are generally negligibly small in a clean system because the coulomb scattering involving large momentum @xmath8 in the @xmath7-direction is suppressed when the width of the inversion layer is many times larger than the lattice spacing .",
    "it is more convenient to work in the same basis as that used for the diffusons , i.e. , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , as it allows for the amplitudes to be easily combined with the diffusion modes .",

    "clearly , only modes that are effectively gapless lead to logarithmically divergent corrections . since the frequency integrations range from @xmath89 ( the upper cut - off follows from taking the diffusion limit ) , for @xmath90 , both @xmath91 and @xmath92 are gapped , while only the @xmath91 modes are effectively gapless when @xmath16 .",
    "( the @xmath50 mode is always gapless . ) of course , when @xmath11 and @xmath12 , all modes are gapless . as as result , the corrections are clearly sensitive to the temperature range considered .      for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , all the modes @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) appearing in eqs.([eqn : sigma_skeleton ] ) and ( [ eqn : gamma_skeleton ] ) are effectively gapless , i.e.",
