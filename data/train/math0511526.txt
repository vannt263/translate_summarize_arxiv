    "the random graph process on @xmath1 vertices , @xmath17 , introduced by erds and rnyi , is a sequence of @xmath18 graphs , @xmath19 , where the @xmath20 is the edgeless graph on @xmath1 vertices , and @xmath21 is obtained by adding a random edge to @xmath22 , chosen uniformly over all missing edges .",
    "a classical result of erds and rnyi ( @xcite ) states that if @xmath23 and @xmath24 , then typically every connected component of @xmath25 is of size @xmath26 , and if @xmath27 then typically there is a single _ giant component _ of size @xmath28 and every other component is of size @xmath26 .",
    "thus , there is a phase transition ( the `` double jump '' ) after @xmath29 edges . for further discussion of this phenomenon ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "a well known problem , introduced by achlioptas , discusses a scenario where two randomly chosen edges are presented at each step , out of which a single edge is chosen by some algorithm @xmath30 .",
    "the goal of the algorithm is to postpone the emerging time of the giant component as much as possible .",
    "this was first examined by bohman and frieze in @xcite . for additional results both on this problem ( as an off - line and as an online problem ) , as well as on the converse problem of creating a giant component ahead of time , see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors describe a generic approach to analyzing the performance of algorithms for the mentioned achlioptas problem . after applying wormald s differential equation method for graph processes @xcite , the emerging time of the giant component",
    "is expressed as a singularity point to a differential equation . using this method ,",
    "the authors are able to provide bounds for the performance of several algorithms .    in this paper , we study a natural generalization of the erds - rnyi random graph process , proposed by itai benjamini in order to model the spreading of an epidemic .",
    "this process of benjamini lets `` infected '' clusters have either a larger or a smaller probability of increasing their size , depending on the value of an external continuous parameter @xmath12 .",
    "this is achieved by embedding basic degree information ( namely , whether or not a site is currently isolated ) into the probability distribution over the missing edges .",
    "note that the given model is the most natural of its kind with respect to the dependency of this probability distribution on the degrees of the vertices .",
    "results on other , more complicated , models may be obtained via methods similar to the ones presented here .",
    "we combine methods of @xcite together with analytical methods , with the same motivation of determining the critical time in which a giant component emerges in this process .",
    "as we mentioned , the generalized process we consider is a parameterized version , dependent on some @xmath31 , which modifies the probability of each edge according to whether or not its endpoints are already connected . in the original achlioptas problem , different algorithms can postpone the phase transition or create it ahead of time , where the biased choice at each step is between precisely two randomly chosen edges . the process we study",
    "considers all missing edges when making its biased choice , and the phase transition is presented as a function of the continuous parameter @xmath12 .    by applying the powerful differential equation method",
    ", we were able to derive properties of our model directly from the system of coupled non - linear ordinary differential equations ( odes ) .",
    "while some of these properties can be proved by relatively simple combinatorial arguments , calculating the precise asymptotic behavior of @xmath8 for @xmath32 via combinatorial arguments seems challenging .",
    "indeed , while at first glance this result appears as though it can be obtained by probabilistic arguments ( e.g. , using monotone coupling to variants of the model , tracking the structure of the connected components throughout certain time intervals , etc . )",
    ", we are not aware of any such derivation at the present time .",
    "in particular , the only way to obtain the @xmath33 behavior of the blowup time is through the careful asymptotic analysis of the derived coupled differential equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite for more on asymptotic analysis of odes ) .",
    "the generalized process can be efficiently implemented . in order to efficiently randomize the next edge",
    ", one needs to maintain the sets of isolated and non - isolated vertices , along with the set of edges already chosen .",
    "our implementation runs in time @xmath34 and requires @xmath35 memory .",
    "the computer simulations show an excellent agreement with the numerical solutions of the odes on the one hand , and with the analytical results concerning @xmath8 on the other hand .",
    "the _ biased graph process _ on @xmath1 vertices , @xmath9 , is the following generalization of the random graph process : as before , the initial graph @xmath36 is the edgeless graph on @xmath1 vertices , and @xmath37 is obtained by adding a single edge to @xmath38 .",
    "the newly added edge is selected according to the following distribution on the missing edges : each edge between two isolated vertices is assigned a weight of @xmath6 , and the weight @xmath12 is assigned to all the remaining edges .",
    "once there are less than @xmath39 isolated vertices , the distribution on the missing edges is uniform .",
    "we extend the definition of @xmath37 to @xmath40 by setting @xmath41 for every such @xmath42 , where @xmath43 denotes the complete graph on @xmath1 vertices .",
    "furthermore , we use the notation @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a graph on @xmath1 vertices , to denote the biased graph process after @xmath46 steps , starting from the initial graph @xmath45 instead of the edgeless graph .",
    "let @xmath47 denote the biased process after scaling its time line by a factor of @xmath4 : @xmath48 since a choice of @xmath49 is equivalent to the erds - rnyi random graph process @xmath50 , the appearing time of the giant component in @xmath50 is typically at @xmath3 .",
    "we study the effect that modifying @xmath12 has on this critical point , @xmath8 , keeping in mind that , intuitively , decreasing the value of @xmath12 should postpone the emerging point of a giant component and vice versa .    throughout the paper",
    ", we say that a random graph on @xmath1 vertices satisfies some property _ with high probability _ , or _ almost surely _ , or that _ almost every _ graph process on @xmath1 vertices satisfies a property , if the corresponding event has a probability which tends to @xmath6 as @xmath1 tends to infinity .",

    "let @xmath53 denote the set of connected components of @xmath54 , and let @xmath55 denote the connected component of a given vertex @xmath56 .",
    "we denote by @xmath57 the set of isolated vertices in @xmath54 , and by @xmath58 the fraction of isolated vertices : @xmath59 notice that , if the graph after @xmath46 steps ( that is , once @xmath46 edges have been added ) contains @xmath60 isolated vertices , then the probability that the next edge is a specific one between two isolated vertices is @xmath61^{-1}~,\\ ] ] and the probability that it is a specific new edge between two vertices that are not both isolated is @xmath12 times that value .",
    "the _ susceptibility _ of @xmath54 , @xmath62 , is defined to be the expected size of a connected component of a uniformly chosen vertex @xmath56 : @xmath63 the susceptibility of @xmath54 is closely coupled with the existence of a giant component in @xmath54 .",
    "indeed , the existence of a giant component of size @xmath64 for some @xmath65 implies that @xmath66 , and conversely , if @xmath67 then at least one connected component is of linear size . following the ideas of @xcite",
    ", we characterize the behavior of the susceptibility along @xmath9 , and in the process obtain the required results on @xmath8 . in order to do so",
    ", we need to examine the typical behavior of the number of isolated vertices along @xmath9 .",
    "the fraction of isolated vertices in @xmath9 , @xmath68 has a value of @xmath6 at @xmath69 , and decreases to @xmath11 over time .",
    "the following theorem summarizes the behavior of @xmath68 :    [ i - thm ] for every @xmath70 and every @xmath71 , almost every biased process on @xmath1 vertices @xmath9 satisfies @xmath72 for every @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the solution to the differential equation : @xmath75 in the special case @xmath76 , the above holds for @xmath77 .",
    "the following proposition analyzes the differential equation whose solution will prove to be a good approximation of the susceptibility along the biased process :    [ z - thm ] let @xmath78 denote the solution for the following differential equation : @xmath79 where @xmath74 is the solution to the differential equation .",
    "for every @xmath70 there exists a singularity point @xmath80 , such that @xmath81 is continuous on @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , there exists some constant @xmath84 , independent of @xmath12 , such that @xmath85 for every @xmath70 .",
    "the next theorem implies that the singularity point of @xmath81 , @xmath86 , is the typical time at which a giant component emerges in a biased process :    [ s - thm ] for every @xmath87 and every @xmath70 , almost every biased process on @xmath1 vertices @xmath9 satisfies the following :    1 .",

    "the above holds when replacing @xmath81 with the function @xmath93 .",
    "finally , the behavior of @xmath8 , the typical point of the phase transition in @xmath9 , is characterized by the following theorem :    [ critical - thm ] let @xmath8 denote the singularity point of the solution to the ode , as defined in proposition [ z - thm ] .",

    "we analyze the asymptotic behavior of @xmath8 for large values of @xmath12 , and prove theorem [ critical - thm ] .",
    "the final section [ sec::conclusion ] is devoted to open problems and concluding remarks .",
    "a main tool in understanding and analyzing the biased process @xmath9 is the stochastic domination relation between @xmath9 and time - stretched versions of the erds - rnyi process @xmath50 . in order to formalize and prove this relation , we consider a wider family of graph processes , defined as follows :    let @xmath96 .",

    "the differential equation ( [ y - eq ] ) for @xmath613 @xmath614 with its initial condition @xmath449 , suggests the transformation @xmath615 , so @xmath616 near the origin , and satisfies @xmath617 with the initial condition @xmath618 .",
    "hereafter @xmath619 means equality of leading order terms .",
    "for @xmath620 we have @xmath621 whose solution is @xmath622 for @xmath623 the logarithmic term is smaller compared to the linear term , hence @xmath624 where @xmath625 is needed to ensure @xmath620 .",
    "we rewrite the differential equation for @xmath626 as @xmath627 where @xmath628 we recognize as a riccati equation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it has no closed - form solution for a general function @xmath629 , and we resort to asymptotic methods .",
    "we obtain an asymptotic approximation of @xmath626 by the method of matched asymptotics .",
    "as shown below , we first construct an asymptotic solution that is valid for @xmath630 , which is then matched to a different asymptotic solution that is valid for @xmath631 up to the blowup point .",
    "first , we use a linear approximation of ( [ eq : riccati ] ) near @xmath632 , by substituting @xmath633 that satisfies @xmath634 with the initial condition @xmath635 , so @xmath636 is small near the origin .",
    "therefore , as long as the nonlinear term satisfies @xmath637 , it can be viewed as a perturbation to the linear equation @xmath638 multiplying ( [ eq : diff - v ] ) by its integrating factor we obtain @xmath639 equations ( [ eq : u ] ) and ( [ eq : c ] ) imply @xmath640 therefore , @xmath641 hence , by equation ( [ eq : int - factor ] ) we have @xmath642 we calculate the integral in equation ( [ eq : v - int ] ) by implying equation ( [ eq : u ] ) @xmath643du \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{k}\\left[-\\frac{2}{1+ku } + \\frac{1}{2(1+ku)^2 } + \\frac{3}{2 } \\right ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , @xmath644 which combined with equation ( [ eq : u - approx ] ) for @xmath645 gives @xmath646 equations ( [ eq : c ] ) and ( [ eq : u - approx ] ) imply that @xmath629 is to leading order @xmath647 recall that the linear approximation for @xmath648 is valid whenever @xmath649 .",
    "equations ( [ eq : v - approx ] ) and ( [ eq : c1 ] ) give @xmath650 , hence the linear approximation ( [ eq : diff - v ] ) holds for @xmath651 .",
    "thus , the approximation ( [ eq : v - approx ] ) holds for @xmath652 .",
    "second , we choose an intermediate point @xmath653 such that @xmath654 , e.g. , @xmath655 , for which @xmath656 , @xmath657 , and @xmath658 .",
    "therefore , @xmath659 and we may approximate equation ( [ eq : riccati ] ) by neglecting the constant term @xmath660 @xmath661 with the initial condition @xmath662 the blowup point @xmath90 satisfies @xmath663 the left hand side of ( [ eq : int - eq ] ) is @xmath664 whereas the right hand side of ( [ eq : int - eq ] ) is calculated by equation ( [ eq : int - c ] ) and the approximation ( [ eq : u - approx ] ) @xmath665 therefore , @xmath666 substituting ( [ initial ] ) and rearranging we obtain @xmath667 note that the result is independent of the choice of the intermediate point @xmath653 , as expected . hence @xmath668 is the leading order asymptotics of the blow up point . throughout the asymptotic analysis we used merely the leading order terms in their validity regimes .",
    "therefore , the higher order terms are guaranteed to be asymptotically smaller than the leading order term , that is , @xmath669    we constructed numerical solutions of the odes , for various values of @xmath12 using mathematica .",
    "figure [ fig::sing - approx ] shows the comparison of the numerical approximation for @xmath8 and the asymptotic result @xmath33 .     obtained by numerical solutions of the odes ( [ y - eq])-([z - eq ] ) , and the asymptotic approximation of theorem [ critical - thm ] .",
    "logarithmic scale was used in both axes . ]      the continuity of the critical point @xmath8 follows from the general continuous dependence of odes on their parameters , which is in our case a single parameter @xmath12 .",
    "thus , to complete the proof we must show that @xmath8 is strictly monotone decreasing in @xmath12 .",
    "we first show that @xmath629 is strict monotone increasing in @xmath12 , i.e. , for any @xmath422 , the corresponding functions @xmath670 ( where @xmath74 is replaced by the corresponding solutions to ) satisfy @xmath671 for every @xmath672 .",
    "recall that by the properties of @xmath74 , as stated in proposition [ prop - y - sol - exp - bound ] , @xmath673 and for every @xmath674 , @xmath629 either strictly increases or strictly decreases to @xmath6 as @xmath675 ( depending on whether @xmath384 or @xmath676 ) .",
    "hence , if @xmath677 or @xmath678 , clearly @xmath671 for every @xmath672 . furthermore",
    ", if @xmath679 , the strict monotonicity of @xmath74 in @xmath12 implies that for every @xmath680 : @xmath681 assume therefore that @xmath682 .",
    "chain rule differentiation of , together with , gives : @xmath683 rearranging equation , we get : @xmath684 combining equations and , we obtain an equality of the form @xmath685 , where @xmath686 satisfies : @xmath687 for all @xmath448 and @xmath672 . by the argument stated in the proof of proposition [",
    "prop - y - sol - exp - bound ] , this implies that @xmath688 is indeed strictly monotone increasing in @xmath12 .    returning to equation ,",
    "since @xmath689 and @xmath688 is strictly monotone increasing in @xmath12 , we conclude that @xmath690 is monotone increasing in @xmath12 for any @xmath409 ( recall that , as stated in the proof of proposition [ z - thm ] , @xmath460 for any @xmath691 and hence @xmath692 for any @xmath409 ) . hence , the above consideration implies that @xmath574 is strictly monotone increasing in @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , @xmath8 is monotone decreasing in @xmath12 , that is , @xmath693 yet , the fact that @xmath574 is strictly monotone increasing in @xmath12 does not guarantee by itself that @xmath8 is _ strictly _ monotone decreasing in @xmath12 .    to this end , we consider solutions @xmath694 and @xmath670 corresponding to @xmath695 and prove that @xmath696 .",
    "the functions @xmath697 and @xmath698 are continuous on @xmath699 and satisfy @xmath700 , therefore @xmath701 such that @xmath702.\\ ] ] the function ( whose choice is made clear below ) @xmath703 satisfies @xmath704 . since @xmath705 as @xmath706",
    ", there exists a point @xmath707 , such that @xmath708 let @xmath709 be the solution of the differential equation @xmath710 recall that @xmath711 is the solution of @xmath712 comparing ( [ eq : z1 * ] ) and ( [ eq : z1 ] ) we note that @xmath713 for all @xmath714 , because @xmath709 is monotone increasing in @xmath715 , @xmath716 , and the choice of @xmath717 in equation ( [ eq : conds ] ) , indicated by @xmath718 hence , @xmath719 for all @xmath720 and @xmath721 where @xmath722 is the blowup point of @xmath709 .",
    "similar considerations show that the blowup point @xmath723 of the solution , @xmath724 , to the differential equation @xmath725 ( remark : if @xmath726 then @xmath696 and the proof is completed , so we assume @xmath727 ) satisfies @xmath728 because the positive term 1 was omitted in ( [ eq : z2 * ] ) compared to ( [ eq : riccati ] ) . the advantage of the differential equations ( [ eq : z1 * ] ) and ( [ eq : z2 * ] ) over the original equation ( [ eq : riccati ] ) is that their blowup points satisfy closed form relations .",
    "namely , @xmath729 assume to the contrary that @xmath730 .",
    "then , by equations ( [ eq : t1 * ] ) and ( [ eq : t2 * ] ) it follows that @xmath731 combining equations ( [ eq : z1t1]),([eq : z2t2]),([eq : t1t2]),([eq : c1c2 ] ) and the positivity of @xmath732 , we obtain @xmath733 since @xmath734 is a monotonic decreasing function of @xmath574 , and @xmath735 , it follows that @xmath736 or equivalently @xmath737 employing equation ( [ eq : z1t1 ] ) with @xmath738 , we find @xmath739 equations ( [ eq : bound1 ] ) and ( [ eq : bound2 ] ) give @xmath740 which contradicts ( [ eq : conds ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath741 .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , there is a well known relation between the `` double jump '' phenomenon in @xmath50 and the critical threshold in percolation .",
    "indeed , the susceptibility corresponds to the size of the component containing the origin , and the appearing of giant component is analogous to the appearing of an infinite cluster .",
    "the subcritical and supercritical stages in the @xmath50 correspond to those in percolation .",
    "however , it is unclear how to define a percolation process which is analogous to the biased process .",
    "consider processes where the probability of adding an edge at each step is biased according to the sizes of the components of its endpoints .",
    "for instance , it is possible to assign the weight @xmath742 to a missing edge @xmath538 , such that @xmath743,@xmath744 for @xmath745 , where @xmath71 is some large constant , and some weight @xmath746 otherwise .",
    "it seems plausible that the above methods can be applied in this scenario as - well .    the biased process @xmath9 was defined as a graph process on the complete graph on @xmath1 vertices , @xmath43 ; in other words , at each step we considered the entire set of missing edges , and the process ended when obtaining @xmath43 .",
    "it is possible to define an analogous process on a different underlying graph @xmath747 , where the edge pool at each step contains only edges belonging to @xmath748 , and the process ends once @xmath45 is obtained . for instance , it is possible to consider the biased process on @xmath749 , the @xmath1-th dimensional cube , or @xmath750 , the @xmath751 grid . in these cases , it may be interesting to study the critical time for satisfying other monotone increasing properties , such as left - right crossing in @xmath750 .",
