    "light - time effect ( hereafter lite ) in eclipsing binaries , caused by the orbital motion of the eclipsing pair around the barycenter of the triple system , produces period variation in minima timings .",
    "it was explained by irwin in 1959 and its necessary criteria have been mentioned by friebos - conde & hertzeg in 1973 .",
    "they are following : agreement with a theoretical lite curve , secondary minima behave identically with primary ones , reasonable value of the mass function and corresponding variations in radial velocity , respectively .",
    "we found , that most of the necessary criteria listed above are satisfied in all systems presented below .",
    "their @xmath0 diagrams are also presented .",
    "the curves represent computed lite versus epoch .",
    "the individual primary and secondary minima are denoted by dots and circles , respectively .",
    "larger symbols correspond to the photoelectric or ccd measurements which were given higher weights in our computations .",
    "all data were found in published papers .",
    "( hd 34364 ) as a variable was discovered in 1931 . for the computations here we use only accurate photoelectric and ccd minima timings . from these data",
    "we have calculated new light elements @xmath1 the period investigation in 1988 was made by chochol et al . with new minima timings",
    "we were able to determine third body orbit with more plausibility . because of the relative low mass of the unresolved component",
    ", the third light must be less than 1 % of the total light .",
    "also the variations in radial velocities , because of the low mass and errors in velocity measurements , are nowadays still inconclusive .",
    "is one of the most exemplary eclipsing binary system which show lite .",
    "almost 300 minima times of r cma ( hd 57167 ) were collected .",
    "our computations with these data lead to new light elements @xmath2 we can discuss our results with system analysis from ribas et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who calculated lower @xmath3 but higher semiamplitude , which gives higher mass function .",
    "variations in radial velocities and also astrometric confirmation from hipparcos satellite is still inconclusive .",
    "the third body is probably wd or m - type dwarf .    .",
    "moffat and vogt performed detailed spectroscopic and photometric study of fz cma ( hd 52942 ) in 1983 , but period investigation was realized only with minima from 1973 to 1980 .",
    "new light elements are @xmath4 as we can see in table i , minimum mass of this body is very high and in very eccentric orbit , so in the system would dominate , what seems unlikely .",
    "possible solution is , that the third body is a binary too , what seems likely and nearly corresponds to the spectral analysis .",
    "( hd 156965 ) as a variable was found by miss cannon ( see pickering 1910 ) .",
    "it was very often observed , what leads to large list of visual minima times and from 40 s to accurate photoelectric and ccd ones , which leads to new light elements @xmath5 we can compare our results with the latest lite study of tx her by ak et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who calculated higher value of excentricity , and semiamplitude , and lower period @xmath3 , so their mass function is nearly double than our .    in table below are @xmath6 masses of components , @xmath3 period of the third body , @xmath7 semiamplitude of lite ( see e.g. mayer 1990 ) , @xmath8 excentricity , @xmath9 length of periastron , @xmath10 computed mass function and @xmath11 minimum mass ( for @xmath12 = 90@xmath13 ) of this predicted body , respectively",
    ".    [ tabl ]",
    "we have derived new lite parameters for four eclipsing binaries by their @xmath0 diagram analysis .",
    "but for the final decision of the presence of lite we need further accurate timings of minima or appropriate confirmation by another method ( radial velocity variations , third light in a light curve analysis or astrometric observations ) .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france , and of nasa s astrophysics data system bibliographic services .",
    "we are grateful to p. niarchos et.al . for their minima measurement of fz cma ,",
    "which was nt still published .",
