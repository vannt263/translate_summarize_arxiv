    "[ introduction ] large logarithmically - enhanced corrections due to soft - gluon radiation are a general feature in the study of the production cross - sections of high - mass systems near threshold .",
    "techniques for resumming these corrections have been developed over the past several years , starting from the case of drell - yan ( dy ) pair production  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we deal with the resummation of logarithmically - enhanced effects in the vicinity of the threshold region in the total cross - section for the hadroproduction of heavy quarks . this topic has been examined in several studies in recent years  @xcite@xcite .",
    "these analyses were limited to soft - gluon resummation to leading - logarithmic accuracy .",
    "the work we present here extends and updates the results of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite by consistently including all the next - to - leading logarithmic contributions .",
    "the resummation program of soft - gluon contributions is best carried out in the mellin - transform space , or @xmath0-space . in @xmath0-moment space",

    "the best studied process  @xcite is drell - yan ( dy ) lepton - pair production . in the dy process the logarithmic terms in the curly bracket of eq .",

    "( [ deltady ] ) the maximum value for @xmath4 is smaller , @xmath6 . in particular , this means that all the double logarithmic ( dl ) terms @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ genlog ] ) are taken into account by simply exponentiating the lowest - order contribution @xmath8 .",
    "then , the exponentiation in eq .",
    "( [ deltady ] ) allows one to define the improved perturbative expansion in eq .",
    "( [ deltadyex ] ) .",

    "the physical bases for the soft - gluon exponentiation in the dy process are dynamics and kinematics factorizations  @xcite .",
    "dynamics factorization follows from gauge invariance and unitarity : in the soft limit multi - gluon amplitudes fulfil generalized factorization formulae given in terms of a single - gluon emission probability . kinematics factorization follows from the fact that the multi - gluon phase space in the appropriate soft limit can exactly be factorized by working in @xmath0 space .",
    "the general extension of these results to the resummation of nll contributions in heavy - quark production was first considered by kidonakis and sterman  @xcite and more recently examined in ref .",
    "there are kinematics and dynamics complications in going from the dy to the heavy - quark processes .",
    "although in the heavy - quark case the kinematics is more involved it can nonetheless be recast in factorized form in @xmath0-moment space  @xcite .",
    "dynamics complications are more essential . while in the dy case resummation",
    "is only associated with the @xmath19-annihilation subprocess , in the heavy - quark case one has to consider both the @xmath19 and @xmath20 subprocesses .",
    "moreover , unlike the dy vector boson , the heavy - quark pair carries colour charge .",
    "thus the heavy - quark cross - section is sensitive to radiative corrections due to soft - gluon emission from the heavy quark and antiquark produced in the final state . in particular",
    ", this emission induces colour exchange in the hard subprocess , whose colour state can thus fluctuate .",
    "the presence of colour fluctuations implies that , after soft - gluon resummation , the partonic cross - sections have an exponentiated form that is more involved than the simple exponential in eq .",
