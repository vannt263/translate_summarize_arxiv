    "one of the elegant methods for solving the laplace / poisson equations ( normally an integral expression of the inverse square law ) is to set up the boundary integral equations ( bie ) which lead to the moderately popular boundary element method ( bem ) . in the forward version of the bem ,",
    "surfaces of a given geometry are replaced by a distribution of point singularities such as source / dipole of unknown strengths .",
    "the strengths of these singularities are obtained through the satisfaction of a given set of boundary conditions that can be dirichlet , neumann or of the robin type .",
    "the numerical implementation requires considerable care @xcite because it involves evaluation of singular ( weak , strong and hyper ) integrals .",
    "some of the notable two - dimensional and three - dimensional approaches are @xcite and @xcite and the references in these papers . despite a large body of literature ,",
    "closed form analytic expressions for computing the effects of distributed singularities are rare @xcite and complicated to implement .",
    "thus , for solving difficult but realistic problems involving , for example , sharp edges and corners or thin elements , introduction of complicated mathematics and special formulations becomes a necessity @xcite .",
    "these drawbacks are some of the major reasons behind the relative unpopularity of the bem despite its significant advantages over domain approaches such as the finite - difference and finite - element methods ( fdm and fem ) while solving non - dissipative problems @xcite .",
    "it is well - understood that most of the difficulties in the available bem solvers stem from the assumption of nodal concentration of singularities which leads to various mathematical difficulties and to the infamous numerical boundary layers @xcite .",
    "the inverse square law exact solutions ( isles ) library , in contrast , is capable of truly modeling the effect of distributed singularities precisely and , thus , its application is not limited by the proximity of other singular surfaces or their curvature or their size and aspect ratio .",
    "the library consists of exact solutions for both potential and flux due to uniform distribution of singularity on flat rectangular and triangular elements . while the rectangular element can be of any arbitrary size @xcite",
    ", the triangular element can be a right angled triangle of arbitrary size @xcite .",
    "since any real geometry can be represented through elements of the above two types ( or by the triangular type alone ) , this library can help in developing solvers capable of solving three - dimensional potential problems for any geometry .",
    "it may be noted here that any non - right - angled triangle can be easily decomposed in to two right - angled triangles .",
    "thus , the right - angled triangles considered here , in fact , can take care of any three - dimensional geometry .",
    "several difficulties were faced in developing the library which arose due to the various terms of the integrals and also from the approximate nature of computation in digital computers . in this paper , we have discussed these difficulties , solutions adopted at present and possible ways of future improvement .",
    "the classic benchmark problem of estimating the capacitance of a unit square plate raised to unit volt has been addressed using a solver based on isles , namely , the nearly exact bem ( nebem ) solver .",
    "results obtained using nebem have been compared with other precise results available in the literature .",
    "the comparison clearly indicates the excellent precision and efficiency achievable using isles and nebem .",
    "in addition , we have also presented the variation of charge density close to the corner of the square plate . usually , using bem , it is difficult to obtain physically consistent results close to these geometric singularities .",
    "wild variations in the magnitude of the charge density has been observed with the change in the degree of discretization , the reason once again being associated with the nodal model of singularities @xcite .",
    "in contrast , using nebem , we have obtained very smooth variation close to the corner . moreover ,",
    "the magnitudes of the charge density have been found to be consistently converging to physically realistic values .",
    "these results clearly indicate that since the foundation expressions of the solver are exact , it is possible to find the potential and flux accurately in the complete physical domain , including the critical near - field domain using nebem . in addition , since singularities are no longer assumed to be nodal and we have the exact expressions for potential and flux throughout the physical domain , the boundary conditions no longer need to be satisfied at _ special _ points such as the centroid of an element .",
    "although consequences of this considerable advantage is still under study , it is expected that this feature will allow nebem to yield accurate estimates for problems involving corners and edges that are very important in a large number of scientific and technological studies .",
    "it should be noted here that the exact expressions for triangular elements consist of a significantly larger number of mathematical operations than those for rectangular elements .",
    "thus , for the solver , it is more economical if we use a mixed mesh of rectangular and triangular elements using rectangular elements as much as possible .",
    "however , in the present work , we have intentionally concentrated on the performance of the triangular elements and results shown here are those obtained using only triangular elements .",
    "the expressions for potential and flux at a point @xmath0 in free space due to uniform source distributed on a rectangular flat surface having corners situated at @xmath1 and @xmath2 has been presented , validated and used in @xcite and , thus , is not being repeated here .    here , we present the exact expressions necessary to compute the potential and flux due to a right - angled triangular element of arbitrary size , as shown in fig.[fig : geomtrielem ] .",
    "it may be noted here that the length in the x direction has been normalized , while that in the z direction has been allowed to be of any arbitrary magnitude , @xmath3 . from the figure , it is easy to see that in order to find out the influence due to triangular element , we have imposed another restriction , namely , the necessity that the x and z axes coincide with the perpendicular sides of the right - angled triangle .",
    "both these restrictions are trivial and can be taken care of by carrying out suitable scaling and appropriate vector transformations .",
    "it may be noted here that closed - form expressions for the influence of rectangular and triangular elements having uniform singularity distributions have been previously presented in @xcite .",
    "however , in these works , the expressions presented are quite complicated and difficult to implement . in @xcite and in the present work ,",
    "the expressions we have presented are lengthy , but completely straight - forward . as a result",
    ", the implementation issues of the present expressions , in terms of the development of the isles library and the nebem solver are managed quite easily .",
    "right - angled triangular element with x - length 1 and an arbitrary z - length , @xmath3 ; p is the point where the influence ( potential and flux ) is being computed , width=288,height=288 ]    it is easy to show that the influence ( potential ) at a point @xmath4 due to uniform source distributed on a right - angled triangular element as depicted in fig.[fig : geomtrielem ] can be represented as a multiple of @xmath5 in which we have assumed that @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as shown in the geometry of the triangular element .",
    "the closed - form expression for the potential has been obtained using symbolic integration @xcite which was subsequently simplified through substantial effort .",
    "it is found to be significantly more complicated in comparison to the expression for rectangular elements presented in @xcite and can be written as @xmath10    where , @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 denotes a constant of integration .",
    "similarly , the flux components due to the above singularity distribution can also be represented through closed - form expressions as shown below :    @xmath21    @xmath22    and ,    @xmath23    where @xmath24 implies the sign of the y - coordinate and @xmath20 indicates constants of integrations .",
    "it is to be noted that the constants of different integrations are not the same .",
    "these expression are expected to be useful in the mathematical modeling of physical processes governed by the inverse square laws .",
    "being exact and valid throughout the physical domain , they can be used to formulate versatile solvers to solve multi - scale multi - physics problems governed by the laplace / poisson equations involving dirichlet , neumann or robin boundary conditions .",
    "due to the tremendous popularity of the c language we have written the codes in the c programming language",
    ". however , it should be quite simple to translate the library to other popular languages such as fortran or c++ , since no special feature of the c language has been used to develop the codes .",
    "the expressions for the rectangular element have been validated in detail in @xcite . here , we present the results for triangular elements in fair detail . in fig.[fig :",
    "cntrtrielem ] , we have presented a comparison of potentials evaluated for a unit triangular element by using the exact expressions , as well as by using numerical quadrature of high accuracy .",
    "the two results are found to compare very well throughout .",
    "please note that contours have been obtained on the plane of the element , and thus , represents a rather critical situation .",
    "similarly , fig.[fig : tridiag1fy ] shows a comparison between the results obtained using closed - form expressions for flux and those obtained using numerical quadrature .",
    "the flux considered here is in the @xmath25 direction and is along a line beginning from @xmath26 and ending at @xmath27 .",
    "the comparison shows the commendable accuracy expected from closed form expressions . in fig.[fig :",
    "surftrielem ] and [ fig : trify_xy0 ] , the surface plots of potential on the element plane ( @xmath28 plane ) and @xmath25-flux on the @xmath29 plane have been presented from which the expected significant increase in potential and sharp change in the flux value on the element is observed .",
    "thus , by using a small fraction of computational resources in comparison to those consumed in numerical quadratures , isles can compute the exact value of potential and flux for singularities distributed on triangular elements .",
    "potential contours on a triangular element computed using exact expressions and by numerical quadrature , width=384,height=384 ]     comparison of flux ( in the y direction ) as computed by isles and numerical quadrature along a diagonal line , width=480,height=288 ]      in order to emphasize the accuracy of isles , we have considered the following severe situations in the near - field region in which it is observed that the quadratures can match the accuracy of isles only when a high degree of discretization is used .",
    "please note that in these cases , the value of @xmath3 has been considered to be 10 . in fig.[fig : tcentroidzvspot ] we have presented the variation of potential along a line on the element surface running parallel to the z - axis of the triangular element ( see fig.[fig : geomtrielem ] ) and going through the centroid of the element .",
    "it is observed that results obtained using even a @xmath30 quadrature is quite unacceptable .",
    "in fact , by zooming on to the image , it can be found that only the maximum discretization yields results that match closely to the exact solution .",
    "it may be noted here that the potential is a relatively easier property to compute .",
    "the difficulty of achieving accurate flux estimates is illustrated in the two following figures .",
    "the variation of flux in the @xmath31-direction along the same line as used in fig.[fig : tcentroidzvspot ] has been presented in fig.[fig : tcentroidzvsfx ] .",
    "similarly , variation of @xmath25-flux along a diagonal line ( beginning at ( -10,-10,-10 ) and ending at ( 10,10,10 ) and piercing the element at the centroid ) has been presented in fig.[fig : tdiag1vsfy ] . from these figures",
    "we see that the flux values obtained using the quadrature are always inaccurate even if the discretization is as high as @xmath30 .",
    "we also observe that the estimates are locally inaccurate despite the use of very high amount of discretization ( @xmath32 or @xmath33 ) .",
    "specifically , in the latter figure , even the highest discretization can not match the exact values at the peak , while in the former only the highest one can correctly emulate the sharp change in the flux value .",
    "it is also heartening to note that the values from the quadrature using higher amount of discretization consistently converge towards the isles values .",
    "variation of potential along a centroidal line on the xz plane parallel to the z axis for a triangular element : comparison among values obtained using the exact expressions and numerical quadratures , width=480,height=288 ]     variation of flux in the x direction along a line on the xz plane parallel to the z axis for a triangular element : comparison among values obtained using the exact expressions and numerical quadratures , width=480,height=288 ]     comparison of flux ( in the y direction ) along a diagonal line piercing the triangular element at the centroid : comparison among values obtained using the exact expressions and numerical quadratures , width=480,height=288 ]      it is expected that beyond a certain distance , the effect of the singularity distribution can be considered to be the same as that of a centroidally concentrated singularity or a simple quadrature .",
    "the optimized amount of discretization to be used for the quadrature can be determined from a study of the speed of execution of each of the functions in the library and has been presented separately in a following sub - section .",
    "if we plan to replace the exact expressions by quadratures ( in order to reduce the computational expenses , presumably ) beyond a certain given distance , the quadrature should necessarily be efficient enough to justify the replacement . while standard but more elaborate algorithms similar to the fast multipole method ( fmm ) @xcite along with the gmres @xcite matrix solver can lead to further of computational efficiency , the simple approach as outlined above can help in reducing a fair amount of computational effort . in the following",
    ", we present the results of numerical experiments that help us in determining the far - field performance of the exact expressions and quadratures of various degrees that , in turn , help us in choosing the more efficient approach for a desired level of accuracy .    in fig.[fig :",
    "diagpffarfield ] we have presented potential values obtained using the exact approach , @xmath30 , @xmath34 and no discretization , i.e. , the usual bem approximation while using the zeroth order piecewise uniform charge density assumption .",
    "the potentials are computed along a diagonal line running from ( -1000 , -1000 , -1000 ) to ( 1000 , 1000 , 1000 ) which pierces a triangular element of @xmath35 .",
    "it can be seen that results obtained using the usual bem approach yields inaccurate results as we move closer than distances of 10 units , while the @xmath34 discretization yields acceptable results up to a distance of 1.0 unit . in order to visualize the errors incurred due to the use of quadratures , we have plotted fig.[fig : errorpot ] where",
    "the errors incurred ( normalized with respect to the exact value ) have been plotted . from this figure",
    "we can conclude that for the given diagonal line , the error due to the usual bem approximation falls below 1% if the distance is larger than 20 units while for the simple @xmath34 discretization , it is 2 units .",
    "it may be mentioned here that along the axes the error turns out to be significantly more @xcite and the limits need to be effectively doubled to achieve the accuracy for all cases possible .",
    "thus , for achieving 1% accuracy , the usual bem is satisfactory only if the distance of the influenced point is five times the longer side of an element .",
    "please note here that the error drops to 1 out of @xmath36 as the distance becomes fifty times the longer side .",
    "besides proving that the exact expressions work equally well in the near - field as well as the far - field , this fact justifies the usual bem approach for much of the computational domain leading to substantial savings in computational expenses .",
    "potential along a diagonal through the triangular element computed using exact , @xmath30 , @xmath34 and usual bem approach , width=480,height=288 ]     error along a diagonal through the triangular element computed using @xmath30 , @xmath34 and usual bem approach , width=480,height=288 ]    the accuracy of the exact expressions used in the isles library is confirmed from the above comparisons .",
    "however , there are several other important issues related to the development of the library that are discussed below briefly .",
    "many of the irrational and transcendental functions have domains and ranges in which they are defined .",
    "moreover , they are often multiply defined in the complex domain ; for example , there are an infinite number of complex values for the logarithm function . in such cases ,",
    "only one principal value must be returned by the function . in general , such values",
    "can not be chosen so as to make the range continuous and thus , lines in the domain called branch cuts need to be defined , which in turn define the discontinuities in the range . while evaluating expressions such as the ones displayed in eqns.([eqn : pottriexact ] - [ eqn : fztriexact ] ) a number of such problems are expected to occur . however ,",
    "when the expressions are analyzed at critical locations such as the corners and edges of the element , it is observed that the terms likely to create difficulties while evaluating potentials are either cancelled out or are themselves multiplied by zero . as a result , at these locations of likely geometric and mathematical singularities , the solution behaves nicely .",
    "however , the same is not true for the expressions related to the flux components . for these",
    ", we have to deal with branch - cut problems in relation to @xmath37 and problems related to the evaluation of @xmath38 .",
    "it should be noted here that these singularities associated to the edges and corners of the elements are of the _ weak _ type and it is expected that exact evaluation of these terms as well will be possible through further work .",
    "however , difficulties of a different nature crop up in these calculations which can be linked directly to the limitation of the computer itself , namely , round - off errors @xcite .",
    "these errors can lead to severe problems while handling multi - scale problems such as those described in @xcite .",
    "a completely different approach is necessary to cope up with these difficulties , for example , the use of extended range arithmetic @xcite , interval arithmetic @xcite or the use of specialized libraries such as the core library of the exact geometric computation ( egc ) initiative @xcite . in the present version of isles ,",
    "a simple approach has been implemented which sets a lower limit to various distance values . below this value ,",
    "the distance is considered to be zero .",
    "plan of future improvements in this regard has been kept at a high priority .",
    "as discussed above , there are possibilities of facing problems while using the exact expressions which may be due to the functions being evaluated or due to round - off errors leading to erroneous results . moreover , despite providing many checks during the computation there is finite possibility of ending up with a wrong value of a property indicated by its being _ nan _ or _ inf _ or potential due to unit positive singularity strength turning out to be _",
    "negative_. in order to maintain the robustness of the library , we have tried to keep checks on the intermediate and final values during the course of the computation .",
    "when the results are found to be unsatisfactory , unphysical , we have re - estimated the results by using numerical quadrature and kept a track of the cause by raising a unique approximation flag which is specific for a problem . as a result ,",
    "the steps for the calculation for a property can be written as follows :    * get the required inputs - geometry of the element and the position where the effect needs to be evaluated ; check whether the element size and distances are large enough so that the results do not suffer from round - off errors .",
    "* check whether the location coincides with one of the _ special _ ones , such as corners or edges . *",
    "evaluate the necessary expressions in accordance with the foregoing results . if necessary",
    ", consider each term in the expressions separately to sort out difficulties related to singularities , branch - cuts or round - off errors .",
    "note that if the multiplier is zero , rest of the term does not need evaluation . *",
    "if direct evaluation of the expressions fail , raise a unique approximation flag specific to this problem and term and return the value of the property by using numerical quadrature . *",
    "compute all the terms and find the final value , check whether the final value is a number and physically meaningful .",
    "if not satisfied , recompute the result using numerical quadrature and raise the relevant approximation flag .      the time taken to compute the potential and flux is an important parameter related to the overall computational efficiency of the codes",
    "this is true despite the fact that , in a typical simulation , the time taken to solve the system of algebraic equation is far greater than the time taken to build the influence coefficient matrix and post - processing .",
    "moreover , the amount of time taken to solve the system of equations tend to increase at a greater rate than the time taken to complete the other two .",
    "it should be mentioned here that the time taken in each of these steps can vary to a significant amount depending on the algorithm of the solver . in the present case",
    ", the system of equations has been solved using lower upper decomposition using the well known crout s partial pivoting .",
    "although this method is known to be very rugged and accurate , it is not efficient as far as number of arithmetic operations , and thus , time is concerned .",
    "it is also possible to reduce the time taken to pre - process ( generation of mesh and creation of influence matrices ) , solve the system of algebraic equations and that for post - process ( computation of potential and flux at the required locations ) can be significantly reduced by adopting faster algorithms , including those involving parallelization .    in order to optimize the time taken to generate the influence coefficient matrix and that to carry out the post - processing",
    ", we carried out a small numerical study to determine the amount of time taken to complete the various functions being used in isles , especially those being used to evaluate the exact expressions and those being used to carry out the quadratures .",
    "the results of the study ( which was carried out using the linux system command _ gprof _ ) has been presented in the following table[table : speedtable ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , we consider the corner problem related to the electrostatics of the above conducting plate . problems of this nature are considered to be challenging for any numerical tool and especially so for the bem approach .",
    "the inadequacy of the bem approach , especially in solving the present problem , has been mentioned even quite recently @xcite in which it has been correctly mentioned that since the method can not extend its mathematical model to include the edges and corners in reality , it is unlikely that it will ever succeed in modeling the edge / corner singularities correctly . as a result , with change in discretization",
    ", the properties near these geometric singularities are expected to oscillate significantly leading to erroneous results . however , as discussed above , the nebem does extend its singularities distributed on the surface elements right till an edge or a corner . moreover , using nebem , it is also possible to satisfy the boundary conditions ( both potential and flux ) as close to the edge / corner as is required . in fact , it should be possible to specify the potentials right at the edge / corner .    in the following study , we have presented estimates of charge density very close the flat plate corner as obtained using nebem .",
    "please note that the boundary conditions have been satisfied at the centroids of each element although we plan to carry out detailed studies of changing the position of these points , especially in relation to problems involving edges / corners . in fig.[fig : comparecornerchden ] , charge densities very close to the corner of the flat plate estimated by nebem using various amounts of discretization have been presented .",
    "it can be seen that each curve follows the same general trend , does not suffer from any oscillation and seems to be converging to a single curve .",
    "this is true despite the fact that there has been almost an order of magnitude variation in the element lengths .",
    "finally , in fig.[fig : fitcornerchden ] , we present a least - square fitted straight line matching the charge density as obtained the highest discretization in this study . it is found that the slope of the straight line is 0.713567 , which compares very well with both old and recent estimates of 0.7034 @xcite .",
    "this is despite the fact that here we have used a relatively coarse discretization near the corner .",
    "it should be mentioned that none of the earlier references cited here used the bem approach . while the former used a singular perturbation technique , the latter used a diffusion based monte - carlo method .",
    "thus , it is extremely encouraging to note that using the nebem approach , we have been able to match the accuracy of these sophisticated techniques .",

    "an efficient and robust library for solving potential problems in a large variety of science and engineering problems has been developed .",
    "exact closed - form expressions used to develop isles have been validated throughout the physical domain ( including the critical near - field region ) by comparing these results with results obtained using numerical quadrature of high accuracy .",
