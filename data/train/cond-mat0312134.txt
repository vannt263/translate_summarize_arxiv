    "in this paper we will briefly review the so - called superstatistics concept@xcite .",
    "it yields a simple and plausible argument why nonextensive methods , as developed by tsallis and many others @xcite , are relevant for nonequilibrium systems with large - scale spatio - temporal fluctuations of an intensive parameter .",
    "superstatistics is a superposition of two ( or even more ) different statistics : one given by ordinary boltzmann factors , and another one given by large - scale fluctuations of one ( or several ) intensive parameters ( e.g.  the inverse temperature ) .",
    "the corresponding stationary probability distributions arise as a convolution of the various statistics .",
    "tsallis statistics is a special case that arises naturally in this approach for a @xmath0-distributed parameter , if the marginal distributions are formed .",
    "but other generalized statistics are possible as well .",
    "recently it has become clear that the concept is not only a theoretical construct but of practical physical relevance .",
    "for example , it is possible to develop superstatistical models that well describe the statistical properties of measured accelerations in lagrangian turbulence experiments @xcite , or the statistics of defect velocities in pattern forming systems @xcite , or the measured energy distribution of cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "consider a driven nonequilibrium systems with spatio - temporal fluctuations of an intensive parameter @xmath1 .",
    "these fluctuations are externally produced , by constantly putting energy into the system which is dissipated .",
    "the intensive parameter may be the inverse temperature , or an effective chemical potential , or a function of the fluctuating energy dissipation in the flow ( for the turbulence application ) .",
    "locally , i.e.  in spatial regions ( cells ) where @xmath1 is approximately constant , the system may be described by ordinary statistical mechanics , i.e.  ordinary boltzmann factors @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is an effective energy in each cell . in the long - term run ,",
    "the system is described by a spatio - temporal average over the fluctuating @xmath1 .",
    "suppose the probability density of @xmath1 is @xmath4 . by integrating over @xmath1",
    "one obtains marginal distributions of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the density of states and @xmath7 is the normalization constant of @xmath8 for a given @xmath1 .",
    "( [ margi ] ) describes the long - term behaviour of the system ( we have chosen type - b superstatistics @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider three important examples ( many more are possible ) .",
    "@xmath1 is distributed according to the @xmath0-distribution @xmath9 @xmath10 is a parameter .",
    "the average of the fluctuating @xmath1 is given by @xmath11 and the second moment of @xmath1 is given by @xmath12 let @xmath13 be a kinetic energy .",
    "the marginal distribution ( [ margi ] ) , obtained by integration over all @xmath1 , yields the generalized canonical distributions of nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a normalization constant and @xmath16 the distributions ( [ gencan ] ) maximize the tsallis entropies @xmath17 subject to suitable constraints @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 is log - normally distributed : @xmath18 the average @xmath19 of the above log - normal distribution is given by @xmath20 and the variance by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "one obtains the superstatistics distribution @xmath23 the integral can not be evaluated in closed form , but it can be easily numerically evaluated and compared with experimental data @xcite .",
    "yet another interesting example of a superstatistics is obtained if we assume that the temperature @xmath24 ( rather than @xmath1 itself ) is @xmath0-distributed . in this case",
    "the corresponding marginal distribution @xmath25 has exponential tails @xcite .",
    "for a given probability distribution @xmath26 of microstates @xmath27 and a given parameter @xmath28 the escort distribution @xmath29 is defined as @xcite @xmath30 both types of distributions , @xmath26 and @xmath29 , notoriously occur in the formulation of nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite , like two spin - degrees of freedom which are not there in classical statistical mechanics ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "we will now show that within the superstatistical approach these two degrees of freedom can be easily understood .",
    "generally , it makes sense to @xmath1-average typical thermodynamic relations if the local cells are sufficiently large and if they are in local equilibrium . in this case one",
    "has for each local cell @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the ordinary boltzmann - gibbs - shannon entropy , @xmath34 is the internal energy and @xmath35 the free energy associated with each cell .",
    "the averaged version reads @xmath36 note that on the right - hand side we obtain averages formed with @xmath37 . for @xmath0-distributed",
    "@xmath1 this is like transforming @xmath38 in the distribution ( [ fluc ] ) .",
    "since @xmath39 and @xmath40 this means one is forming averages with respect to the escort distributions on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ gibbs ] ) , as required in the modern versions of nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "our argument is valid for arbitrary energies @xmath3 .",
    "we see that within the superstatistical @xmath1-averaging approach entropic quantities most naturally correspond to the original distribution @xmath41 , energetic quantities such as @xmath34 or @xmath35 most naturally to the escort distribution @xmath42 , since there is an additional factor @xmath1 on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ gibbs ] ) .    in general , the averaged shannon entropy on the left - hand side",
    "does not coincide with the tsallis entropy @xmath17 , which satisfies @xcite @xmath43 however , it might be interesting to construct special situations where eq .",
    "( [ gibbs ] ) and ( [ gibbsq ] ) are equivalent .",
    "langevin equations where the parameters fluctuate on a large spatio - temporal scale yield a concrete dynamical realization of superstatistics @xcite .",
    "for example , to model the motion of a single test particle in a turbulent flow one considers a superstatistical extension of the sawford model @xcite .",
    "the sawford model describes the joint stochastic process @xmath44 of acceleration , velocity and position of a lagrangian test particle in a turbulent flow by the stochastic differential equation @xmath45 where @xmath46 is gaussian white noise .",
    "note that in this model the acceleration @xmath47 and not the velocity @xmath48 is driven by white noise , so the meaning of the variables is different as compared to an ordinary brownian particle . @xmath49 and @xmath50 are two time scales , with @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath53 is the energy dissipation , @xmath54 the kinematic viscosity , @xmath55 are lagrangian structure function constants , and @xmath56 is the variance of the velocity distribution .",
    "the sawford model with constant coefficients predicts gaussian stationary distributions for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and is thus at variance with recent measurements @xcite .",
    "however , a superstatistical generalization of the sawford model @xcite well fits the data .    for @xmath57 one can derive @xcite that the fluctuating parameter @xmath1 is given by @xmath58 i.e.",
    "the fluctuating energy dissipation @xmath53 is proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "1 shows the measured probability density of the acceleration of a lagrangian test particle in a turbulent flow as obtained in the experiment of bodenschatz et al .",
    "log - normal superstatistics with @xmath60 yields an excellent fit @xcite .    * fig .  1 * histogram of accelerations @xmath47 as measured in @xcite and the log - normal superstatistics prediction eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) with @xmath60 . for comparison",
    ", the figure also shows tsallis statistics ( eq .  ( [ gencan ] ) with @xmath61 ) .",
    "similar superstatistical models can be formulated for pattern forming systems , just that the meaning of the variables in the langevin equation is different .",
    "the probability density of defect velocities in inclined layer convection experiments can be quite precisely measured . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , it quite precisely coincides with a tsallis distribution with @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "a superstatistical model well describes various stochastic properties of these defects .      *",
