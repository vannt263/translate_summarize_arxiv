    "recently there has been much interest in the manganite compounds @xmath7 , where r is a rare - earth element such as la or nd and a is a divalent metal ion such as ca , sr or pb . these compounds are generally ferromagnetic for @xmath8 and in many of them , near the curie temperature @xmath5 , the electrical resistivity @xmath9 decreases strongly in an applied magnetic field .",
    "this effect is known as colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) and a recent review is by ramirez @xcite .",
    "ferromagnetism in these compounds is believed to be due to the `` double exchange '' ( de ) mechanism , which operates when local spins are strongly coupled , by hund s rule , to the spins of itinerant electrons occupying a narrow band .",
    "the local spins , of magnitude @xmath10 , correspond to three localized mn d electrons of @xmath11 symmetry and the band is derived from mn d states of @xmath12 symmetry .",
    "the band contains @xmath13 electrons per atom .",
    "millis @xcite stressed that to describe the physics of the manganites completely it is necessary to consider coupling of the electrons to local phonons as well as to local spins .",
    "subsequently , millis @xcite made detailed calculations of such a model , with local spins and local moments treated classically , using dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "recently green @xcite , extending a many - body coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) developed by edwards @xcite for the pure de model , considered a similar model with local spins and local phonons treated quantum - mechanically . in the classical spin limit of the de model",
    "the many - body cpa is equivalent to the dmft of furukawa @xcite .",
    "green @xcite discussed a number of physical properties of the model with electron - phonon coupling , which he called the holstein - de model .",
    "these include the resistivity , and its dependence on the applied magnetic field ( the cmr effect ) and on pressure , and the curie temperature @xmath5 . in section  [ sec : many - body - cpa ] we summarize the many - body cpa treatment of the holstein - de model and comment on the application of green s results to the manganites .",
    "the aim of this paper is to calculate some spectral properties of the model and to compare with experimental results .",
    "we restrict our attention to the paramagnetic state and the ferromagnetic ground state where the many - body cpa simplifies considerably . in section  [ sec : angle - resolv - phot ]",
    "we calculate spectral functions which relate to the results of angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) and in section  [ sec : optical - conductivity ] we consider the optical conductivity . in section  [ sec : spin - wave - spectrum ] we calculate the spin - wave stiffness constant in the ferromagnetic state at @xmath2 and show how it decreases with increasing electron - phonon coupling in a similar way to @xmath5 .",
    "a brief summary is given in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of the holstein - de model in the absence of an applied magnetic field is @xmath14 the first two terms constitute the de model and the first , third and fourth terms form the holstein model @xcite .",
    "einstein phonons on site @xmath15 , with energy @xmath16 and creation operator @xmath17 couple to the electron occupation number @xmath18 with coupling strength @xmath4 .",
    "here @xmath19 , where @xmath20 creates an electron of spin @xmath21 on lattice site @xmath15 .",
    "the conduction electron spin @xmath22 couples to the local spin @xmath23 with hund exchange parameter @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the band hopping integral .",
    "the components of @xmath26 are defined as @xmath27 it is reasonable to assume that the manganites are in the double exchange limit @xmath28 @xcite , where @xmath29 is the width of the itinerant electron band , and in this paper we assume @xmath30 .",
    "this ensures that there is no double occupation of a site by electrons , so that the system is a mott insulator for @xmath31 .",
    "this is not so for the two - band model used by millis @xcite , and held and vollhardt @xcite have stressed the need to introduce a strong on - site coulomb interaction in this case",
    ". clearly the one - band model neglects effects of @xmath12 orbital degeneracy such as a proper treatment of the jahn - teller effect and the orbital ordering which occurs in the undoped system ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "however the nature of the local phonon mode in equation  ( [ eq : h_hde ] ) is not specified and could correspond to a tetrahedral distortion of the oxygen octahedron surrounding a mn site as in the dynamical jahn - teller effect .",
    "an important feature of the many - body cpa for the one - particle retarded green function is that it becomes exact in the atomic limit @xmath32 . in this limit , and with @xmath30 , the green function is given by @xcite @xmath33^{1/2}\\right\\ } }    { ( 2s+1)\\exp\\{\\lambda\\left[2b({\\omega})+1\\right]\\}}\\\\    \\times\\frac{(2s+1)\\frac{n}{2}\\exp\\left(r\\beta{\\omega}/2\\right)+(s+1)(1-n)\\exp\\left(-r    \\beta{\\omega}/2\\right)}{{\\epsilon}+r{\\omega}}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the modified bessel function , @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the bose function with @xmath37 . in taking the limit @xmath38",
    "we have made a shift of energy origin @xmath39 and the polaron binding energy @xmath40 is also absorbed in the chemical potential .",
    "the form of the many - body cpa used by green @xcite for finite band - width becomes particularly simple in the paramagnetic state . for a band density of states of elliptic form @xmath41\\sqrt{w^2-{\\epsilon}^2}$ ] , the local green function @xmath42 satisfies the cpa equation @xmath43 furthermore the self - energy @xmath44 is related to the local green function by the equation @xcite @xmath45 as well as the paramagnetic state , we shall also consider the case of a completely saturated ferromagnetic state at zero temperature , with all local and itinerant spins aligned .",
    "then the double - exchange term in equation  ( [ eq : h_hde ] ) becomes merely a constant shift in energy and the hamiltonian is equivalent to that of the pure holstein model . within the many - body cpa",
    "the saturated state is actually the self - consistent ground state only for @xmath46 @xcite and we shall mainly consider this limit .",
    "it is found that in the de model @xcite neither @xmath5 nor the resistivity vary enormously with @xmath47 so that this is a reasonable approximation to the @xmath10 mn spin . in the saturated ferromagnetic state at @xmath2 , with all @xmath48 electrons per atom having @xmath49 spin , the local green function @xmath50 again satisfies equation  ( [ eq : self_cons ] ) with @xmath51 replaced by @xmath52    the many body cpa is successful in describing the crossover from weak electron - phonon coupling , through intermediate coupling where small - polaron bands begin to appear , to strong coupling where some results similar to those of standard small - polaron theory are recovered .",
    "it therefore extends the work of millis @xcite , where phonons are treated classically , to the quantum small - polaron regime .",
    "one important quantum effect on a thermodynamic property is the behaviour of @xmath5 for strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "millis @xcite find @xmath53 whereas green @xcite finds @xmath5 is exponentially small for @xmath54 .",
    "the physics is dominated by a very narrow polaron band .",
    "green @xcite showed how the holstein - de model could describe the very different behaviour of @xmath55 ( lsmo ) and @xmath56 ( lcmo ) , with @xmath57 where @xmath5 is largest . in lsmo the resistivity @xmath9 increases monotonically with temperature @xmath58 , with a metal - poor metal transition at @xmath5 , whereas lcmo shows a metal - insulator transition with @xmath9 decreasing with @xmath58 above @xmath5 .",
    "also @xmath59 is an order of magnitude smaller in lsmo than in lcmo , this type of behaviour can be understood in the holstein - de model by assuming that @xmath60 is about @xmath61 larger in lcmo than in lsmo and , within the model , this is consistent with the considerably lower @xmath5 in lcmo .",
    "( the form of @xmath62 in figure  7 of reference  4 is indistinguishable for @xmath63 from that shown for @xmath64 @xcite and contrasts strongly with the curve in figure  6 for @xmath65 ) .",
    "the calculated resistivity is not as sensitive to applied magnetic field and pressure as observed but this discrepancy might be removed by introducing a decrease in @xmath60 with decreasing resistivity owing to enhanced screening of the ionic charges @xcite .",
    "a defect of the cpa treatment is its failure to describe coherent bloch - like states in the saturated ferromagnetic state at @xmath2 , leading to a spurious residual resistivity @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we calculate further properties of the holstein - de model and confront them with experiment .",
    "the decreasing resistivity of lcmo as the temperature increases above @xmath5 is , according to millis @xcite and green @xcite , due to the gradual filling of a pseudogap in the density of states . in green s",
    "work the pseudogap contains well - defined polaron sub - bands in the ( hypothetical ) paramagnetic state at @xmath2 but above @xmath5 , with parameters appropriate to lcmo , these are smeared out so as to resemble the classical picture of millis .",
    "the pseudogap should be observable in arpes measurements and in optical conductivity . in an excellent paper on arpes for the bilayer manganite @xmath0 , nominally with @xmath66 , dessau",
    "@xcite interpret their results very much in the spirit of the holstein model . in this section",
    "we present some calculations of the spectral functions in the low temperature ferromagnetic state to compare with this experimental data . for convenience",
    "we take @xmath67 and also @xmath68 , as discussed above .",
    "the charge ordering which might occur for @xmath67 is suppressed since our treatment imposes spatial homogeneity . with this constraint",
    "there is no qualitative difference between systems with @xmath67 and with @xmath69 or @xmath70 , for example .",
    "we take the phonon energy to be @xmath71 , the same typical value used in previous calculations @xcite .",
    "a half - width @xmath72 ev is consistent with the @xmath12 bands crossing the fermi level in the calculations of dessau @xcite , shown in figure  [ fig : weights : b ] .",
    "the low @xmath73 k in this bilayer manganite is partly due to quasi - two dimensional fluctuations , but the large resistivity @xmath74 m@xmath75cmat low temperatures indicates that small - polaron bands might exist even in the ferromagnetic state .",
    "consequently the electron - phonon coupling should be stronger than in cubic manganites like lcmo and we choose @xmath76 .",
    "the one - electron spectral function is given by @xmath77^{-1}\\\\    & = -\\pi^{-1}{\\sigma}_{{\\epsilon}}''/[({\\epsilon}-{\\epsilon_{\\bi{k}}}-{\\sigma}'_{\\epsilon})^2+{{\\sigma}_{\\epsilon}''}^2]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 , @xmath79 are the real and imaginary parts of the self - energy @xmath44 and @xmath80 is the band energy for wave - vector @xmath81 . in the ferromagnetic state at @xmath2",
    "the local green function @xmath82 is calculated from equation  ( [ eq : self_cons ] ) , with @xmath51 defined by ( [ eq : g_al_t0 ] ) , and @xmath44 follows from equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "these equations assume an elliptic density of states which we here regard as an approximation to the density of states for a band which takes the form @xmath83 for @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "this band is shown as a full line in figure  [ fig : weights : a ] and crosses the fermi level @xmath86 at @xmath87 .",
    "it roughly models one of the @xmath88 bands in figure  [ fig : weights : b ] .",
    "the calculated results for @xmath89 are shown in figure  [ fig : spec_func_th ] .",
    "well away from the fermi level , a well - defined peak exists which broadens as @xmath81 approaches the fermi momentum at @xmath90 . for larger @xmath91",
    "the weight below the fermi level is strongly reduced .",
    "the peaks never approach the fermi level closely which is an important feature of the observed spectra @xcite reproduced in figure  [ fig : spec_func_exp ] .",
    "the theoretical curves in figure  [ fig : spec_func_th ] resemble quite closely the data of figure  [ fig : spec_func_exp](c ) .",
    "there is a pseudogap in the calculated spectra extending about 0.1 ev on each side of the fermi level .",
    "in fact this pseudogap contains polaron bands like those shown in figure  4 of green s paper @xcite .",
    "however , their amplitude is too small to show up in figure  [ fig : spec_func_th ] and in the experimental data .",
    "nevertheless , it is the central polaron band around the fermi level which is responsible for the low but finite conductivity of the system .",
    "the positions of the peaks in figure  [ fig : spec_func_th ] are plotted in figure  [ fig : weights : a ] and comparison can be made with the right half of figure  [ fig : weights : b ] reproduced from dessau @xcite . filled and",
    "unfilled symbols correspond to high and low weights , respectively , obtained by integration of the spectral function up to the fermi energy .",
    "this comparison between theory and experiment supports the conclusion of dessau @xcite that , in the manganites with a layered structure , strong electron - phonon coupling ( with the appearance of a pseudogap ) is already important below @xmath5 .",
    "this contrasts with the usual pseudocubic manganites where the pseudogap only appears above @xmath5 .",
    "previous work related to ours is the calculation by perebeinos and allen @xcite of arpes spectra in a two - band model of undoped @xmath92 .",
    "it should be mentioned that moreo @xcite interpret the observed pseudogap not as an intrinsic property but in terms of phase separation .",

    "in the local approximation of cpa or dmft there is no vertex correction in the current - current response function which may thus be expressed in terms of the one - particle spectral function . in the paramagnetic state the optical conductivity is given by @xcite @xmath99 where the electron velocity @xmath100 , @xmath101 is the volume of the unit cell , @xmath102 + 1\\}^{-1}$ ] is the fermi function and @xmath103 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "since @xmath89 depends on @xmath81 only through @xmath80 we may define a function @xmath104 such that @xmath105 , where the dependence of @xmath106 on @xmath107 and @xmath108 has been suppressed in the notation .",
    "hence the sum in equation  ( [ eq : sigma_1 ] ) may be written as @xmath109 the last step following by gauss s theorem . for a simple cubic tight binding band @xmath110 , with @xmath111 summed over @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "then the summand in equation  ( [ eq:2 ] ) is a function of @xmath80 only and equation  ( [ eq : sigma_1 ] ) becomes @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the density of states for the simple cubic band . by using equation  ( [ eq : spec_func ] ) in the definition of @xmath116 , and integrating with respect to @xmath80 , we obtain @xmath117\\biggr\\}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath118 since we calculate the self - energy @xmath119 using the elliptic density of states @xmath120 , as discussed in section  [ sec : many - body - cpa ] , it is reasonable to approximate @xmath121 in equation  ( [ eq:3 ] ) by @xmath122 .",
    "the integral over @xmath123 can then be carried out by parts so that , using the definition of @xmath124 , we find @xmath125 with @xmath126 given by equation  ( [ eq : spec_func ] ) , @xmath80 being replaced by @xmath123 .",
    "this is of the form given by chung and freericks @xcite and chattopadhyay @xcite .",
    "if @xmath121 in equation  ( [ eq:3 ] ) is replaced by a gaussian , corresponding to a hypercubic lattice in infinite dimensions , the factor @xmath127 in equation  ( [ eq:4 ] ) is replaced by a constant @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use equation  ( [ eq:4 ] ) which is consistent with our previous calculations of @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "this expression satisfies the correct one - band sum rule @xcite that @xmath129 , where the `` kinetic energy '' @xmath130 is the thermal average per lattice site of the first term in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_hde ] ) .    as in section",
    "[ sec : angle - resolv - phot ] we take @xmath94 , @xmath72 ev , @xmath131 mev and , as previously @xcite , @xmath132 , which is slightly larger than the mn ",
    "mn distance in perovskite manganites .",
    "it is again convenient to take @xmath67 so that for @xmath94 the chemical potential @xmath133 is fixed at the centre of the occupied band for all temperatures , by symmetry . in the ferromagnetic state at @xmath2 the spin - degeneracy factor 2 in equation  ( [ eq:4 ] ) is omitted .",
    "there have been numerous optical investigations of the manganites and the experimental data and their interpretation are varied . for photon energy @xmath134",
    "ev various peaks in the optical conductivity have been assigned to interband transitions between the hund s rule split bands and to charge - transfer transitions between the o 2p and the mn @xmath12 bands .",
    "the latter do not appear in our one - band model and our assumption of @xmath30 eliminates the upper hund s rule band .",
    "our calculated @xmath135 is therefore only non - zero in the region @xmath136 ev and in general exhibits one peak .",
    "we shall focus the discussion by considering one material , @xmath1 ( nsmo ) , which has been investigated by at least two experimental groups . in the paramagnetic state above @xmath5",
    "there is one feature common to data on both thin films @xcite and single crystals @xcite .",
    "this is a broad peak at about 1.2 ev with a maximum conductivity @xmath137 ( m@xmath75cm)@xmath138 .",
    "however in nsmo films @xmath5 , as deduced from the maximum in the resistivity @xmath62 , is larger in oxygen - annealed films ( @xmath139 k ) than in an unannealed sample ( @xmath140 k ) @xcite . in a nsmo single crystal ,",
    "on the other hand , @xmath62 is essentially the same ( @xmath141 k ) in polished and annealed samples but the peak in the polished sample is shifted to @xmath142 ev with a reduced @xmath143 ( m@xmath75cm)@xmath138 . since @xmath62 and @xmath135 are quantitatively quite similar in nsmo and lcmo @xcite we model nsmo with electron - phonon coupling @xmath65 , the same value as proposed by green @xcite for lcmo .",
    "the dc conductivity @xmath128 at @xmath144 k is also very similar in annealed nsmo and lcmo films , 2.9 and 3.3 ( m@xmath75cm)@xmath138respectively @xcite .",
    "the value for nsmo agrees well with a measured @xmath128 of 3.2 ( m@xmath75cm)@xmath138at @xmath145 k in a nsmo single crystal @xcite .",
    "using the parameters discussed above the curie temperature of the model is about 230 k @xcite and in figure  [ fig : oc : a ] we plot the calculated optical conductivity for the ferromagnetic state at @xmath2 and the paramagnetic state at @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "the low dc conductivity of 0.11 ( m@xmath75cm)@xmath138at @xmath2 is due to the inadequate treatment of the coherent ground state in the cpa . fortuitously the incoherent scattering introduced by the cpa seems to model quite well the low temperature incoherent scattering in the unannealed nsmo sample of kaplan @xcite which has a dc conductivity of about 0.15 ( m@xmath75cm)@xmath138at @xmath145 k. this optical data is reproduced in figure  [ fig : oc : b ] for comparison with the calculated results of figure 4a . in annealed nsmo films",
    "@xcite , and in single crystals @xcite , @xmath135 in the low temperature ferromagnetic state continues to rise with decreasing @xmath108 down to much lower photon energy , and @xmath148 ( m@xmath75cm)@xmath138 . the above - mentioned defect of the present cpa treatment is associated with the absence of the sharp quasi - particle peak in the spectral function whith should exist in the ferromagnetic state at @xmath2 .",
    "consequently the drude peak in @xmath135 at low frequency is also absent .    as pointed out above",
    ", @xmath135 is much less sample - dependent in the paramagnetic state above @xmath5 and a quantitative comparison with theory is meaningful . in figure",
    "[ fig : oc : a ] @xmath149 ( m@xmath75cm)@xmath138and it must be remembered that this curve is the contribution of optical transitions within the @xmath12 band only . to compare with the data of figure  [ fig : oc : b ]",
    "one should subtract the background due to other transitions which might leave an effective @xmath143 ( m@xmath75cm)@xmath138 .",
    "bearing in mind the simplicity of the one - band model , this order - of - magnitude agreement between theory and experiment is satisfactory .",
    "our calculated results are quite similar to those of figure 7d in millis @xcite .",
    "clearly , for the present intermediate electron - phonon coupling strength , their classical treatment of phonons is sufficient to obtain the essential features of the optical conductivity .",
    "the calculated peak in @xmath135 with @xmath150 ev arises from @xmath81-conserving transitions across the type of pseudogap discussed in section  [ sec : angle - resolv - phot ] . during the process",
    "an electron moves from one site to a neighbouring one which was previously unoccupied .",
    "the electron motion is accompanied by a lattice distortion , of jahn - teller type , which corresponds to a displacement of the local phonon oscillator coordinate in the holstein - de model .",
    "when an electron enters ( leaves ) a site the final displaced ( undisplaced ) oscillator is generally in an excited state with typical excitation energy @xmath151 .",
    "this is the atomic - limit polaron binding energy and for the parameters assumed here is about 0.5 ev .",
    "thus the peak in @xmath135 occurs at about twice the polaron binding energy just as in the standard small - polaron theory @xcite .",
    "however for the present intermediate electron - phonon coupling @xmath65 polaron bands near the fermi level are largely washed out above @xmath5 @xcite , so standard small - polaron theory is not expected to apply to @xmath135 for low photon energies . in fact an activation energy in the dc conductivity of 0.25 ev , half the polaron binding energy as predicted by small - polaron theory @xcite , is about a factor 4 larger than one deduced from green s @xcite numerical calculations .",
    "green s calculation of the dc resistivity above @xmath5 is in reasonable agreement with experiments on nsmo where an activation energy of about 0.08 ev is found @xcite .",
    "lee @xcite quote an activation energy of about 0.15 ev and , with undue reliance on small - polaron theory , expect to have a peak in @xmath135 at about 0.6 ev .",
    "although there is no sign of such a peak in their data they claim that their one broad peak near 1.2 ev should be interpreted in terms of a two - peak structure , one near 1.5 ev and the other below 1 ev .",
    "our interpretation of the 1.2 ev peak in @xmath135 for @xmath152 is broadly in line with that of several other previous authors @xcite .",
    "however we stress again that , for moderate electron - phonon coupling standard small - polaron theory does not hold at low photon energy , where only states around the fermi level are involved , so no simple link between peak position and the activation energy of the dc conductivity can be made .",
    "below @xmath5 the peak in @xmath135 shifts to lower frequency as the pseudogap rapidly fills in .",
    "however in our calculations this shift is held up due to spurious incoherent scattering in the ground state , which limits the low - temperature dc conductivity .",
    "the same effect actually occurs in unannealed nsmo films ( figure  [ fig : oc ] ) but in annealed films and single crystals the peak shifts almost to zero frequency @xcite .",
    "the theoretical situation could be improved by introducing screening effects in the electron - phonon interaction so that @xmath60 decreases with decreasing resistivity , as mentioned at the end of section  [ sec : many - body - cpa ] .",
    "the spurious residual resistivity at @xmath2 drops from 9 m@xmath75cmto 0.5 m@xmath75cmas @xmath60 decreases from 0.16 to 0.10 @xcite .",
    "ishihara @xcite and mack and horsch @xcite have given an alternative interpretation of the broad low energy peak at @xmath2 in terms of orbital degrees of freedom in the doubly - degenerate @xmath12 band .",
    "they propose that strong correlation , with the constraint of no doubly occupied sites , leads to incoherent motion of the carriers .",
    "quijada @xcite considered the spin - wave stiffness constant @xmath3 in the saturated ferromagnetic state at @xmath2 and its relation to optical conductivity .",
    "however their derivation of an expression for @xmath3 was restricted to the de model . here",
    "we derive a simple approximate formula for the spin - wave spectrum of the holstein - de model .",
    "our main aim is to calculate @xmath3 as a function of electron - phonon coupling strength and to compare with the corresponding behaviour of @xmath5 . in the limit of @xmath38",
    "the local and itinerant spins are locked together as we make the ansatz @xmath153 for the state ( unnormalized as yet ) with a magnon of wave - vector @xmath154 excited . here",
    "@xmath155 is the exact ferromagnetic ground state , which we assume to be one of complete spin alignment , and the spin lowering operators are defined by @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the position of lattice site @xmath15 .",
    "actually we do not know the state @xmath155 exactly for the holstein - de model , unlike the de model , but we shall only approximate it at a later stage .",
    "the spin - wave energy is given by @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the exact ground state energy , so that @xmath160 . by the variational principle ,",
    "this is an upper bound on @xmath161 . using equation  ( [ eq : wave_function ] ) it is easy to show that @xmath162}{\\left|f{\\right{\\rangle } } } }    { { \\laq\\left.\\right|q{\\right{\\rangle}}}}\\ ] ] and @xmath163 , where @xmath47 is the magnitude of the localized spin @xmath23 .",
    "only the first term in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_hde ] ) makes a non - zero contribution to the commutator .",
    "this one - electron term may be written as @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the occupation number for the bloch state @xmath166 . a straight - forward calculation yields @xmath167 where @xmath168 .",
    "assuming a simple cubic tight - binding band @xmath169 , the sum being over 6 nearest neighbour sites , we find @xmath170 since @xmath171 has cubic symmetry in @xmath81-space , the @xmath81 sum in equation  ( [ eq : omega_step1 ] ) is independent of the particular neighbour @xmath172 . by including the factor",
    "@xmath173 it may therefore be written as @xmath174 .",
    "hence @xmath175 where @xmath176 and @xmath177 here @xmath130 is the expectation value of the kinetic energy which appears in the optical sum rule mentioned in section  [ sec : optical - conductivity ] . by expanding equation  ( [ eq:5 ] ) in powers of @xmath154 to second order",

    "this is no longer the case when we proceed to evaluate it within the many - body cpa .",
    "clearly , equations  ( [ eq:5 ] ) and  ( [ eq:6 ] ) apply equally to the holstein - de and the de model .",
    "however , we shall show that electron - phonon coupling in the former model has a strong influence via @xmath171 . in the limit @xmath38 , equation  ( [ eq:6 ] ) is equivalent to results derived by nagaev @xcite , kubo and ohata @xcite , furukawa @xcite ,",
    "wang @xcite and quijada @xcite for the de model .",
    "the @xmath130 defined in the latter paper is one - third of our kinetic energy .",
    "furukawa also derived the dispersion relation of equation  ( [ eq:5 ] ) for the de model . now",
    "@xmath180 where @xmath181 , given by equation  ( [ eq : spec_func ] ) , is calculated for the saturated ferromagnetic state at @xmath2 . as in deriving @xmath135 we can replace the @xmath81 sum in equation  ( [ eq:6 ] ) by an energy integral .",
    "hence , using the notation @xmath126 introduced in equation  ( [ eq:4 ] ) , @xmath182 as in the previous section we have approximated the simple cubic density of states by the elliptic density of states @xmath183 . to match the other calculations in this paper , in particular that of the optical conductivity",
    ", we calculate @xmath126 , and hence the double integral in equation  ( [ eq:8 ] ) which represents the average kinetic energy @xmath130 , in the limit @xmath46 .",
    "however , in the prefactor in equation  ( [ eq:8 ] ) we put @xmath10 as is appropriate for the localized mn spins",
    ". this corresponds to calculating the bloch wall stiffness constant ( @xmath184 ) , which is a static quantity , in the limit @xmath185 but retaining the essential finiteness of the spin in the dynamical quantity @xmath3 .",
    "otherwise we use the same parameters as in previous sections , except that we now take @xmath186  . in section",
    "[ sec : optical - conductivity ] we used @xmath132  , for consistency with our earlier work on conductivity , but 4  is closer to the mn  mn distance in the pseudocubic manganites .    in figure",
    "[ fig : spin_stiffness ] we plot the spin - wave stiffness @xmath3 at @xmath2 as a function of electron - phonon coupling @xmath60 .",
    "the reason for the striking decrease of @xmath3 with @xmath60 , particularly in the range @xmath187 applicable to the manganites , is clear from equation  ( [ eq:6 ] ) . for @xmath188 , the pure de model , @xmath189 for @xmath81 within the fermi surface and @xmath190 otherwise .",
    "the negative quantity @xmath130 is the full non - interacting one - electron energy of the ferromagnetic state which drives the double - exchange mechanism . for larger @xmath60",
    ", @xmath171 is more spread out over the whole zone and @xmath191 decreases . in an extreme limit where electrons are localized at sites",
    ", @xmath171 is constant throughout the zone and hence @xmath192 .",
    "this behaviour of @xmath3 in the holstein - de model is very similar to that of @xmath5 , as calculated by green @xcite .",
    "the main difference is in the extreme strong - coupling limit where @xmath5 becomes very small at @xmath193 whereas @xmath3 is decreasing quite slowly .",
    "the slow decrease of @xmath3 is exactly what one expects from equation  ( [ eq:6 ] ) and small - polaron theory , where the kinetic energy @xmath194 @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 seems to be determined more by the width of the narrow polaron band around the fermi level , which decreases exponentially with @xmath4 .",
    "thus one may expect that @xmath6 increases with increasing @xmath4 , and thus with decreasing @xmath5 .",
    "this is found experimentally , as discussed later .",
    "the spin - wave stiffness @xmath3 versus electron - phonon coupling @xmath4 in the saturated ferromagnetic state at @xmath2 .",
    "the plot is for @xmath68 , @xmath72 ev , @xmath67 and @xmath186 .,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    green and edwards @xcite find that , in the de model with @xmath67 , @xmath5 only increases by @xmath195 when @xmath47 increases from @xmath196 to @xmath197 .",
    "a similar insensitivity to @xmath47 for @xmath198 is expected in the holstein - de model .",
    "hence , from equation  ( [ eq:8 ] ) , with @xmath126 taken in the @xmath185 limit as discussed , we have @xmath199 .",
    "this is similar to the result @xmath200 for the spin @xmath201 nearest neighbour simple cubic heisenberg model , with @xmath5 calculated in mean field theory . using values of @xmath5 accurate to within about @xmath202 @xcite we find an improved heisenberg value of @xmath203 for @xmath204 , and @xmath205 for an interpolated @xmath206 which models the spin per site @xmath207 in the present model . in the present calculations for @xmath208 , together with those of green @xcite for @xmath5 , we find , for @xmath10 , @xmath209 for @xmath63 and @xmath210 for @xmath65 . with @xmath186",
    " these values correspond to @xmath211 and @xmath212 @xmath213 , respectively .",
    "the agreement of these values of @xmath214 with the heisenberg model suggests that for moderate @xmath60 the ferromagnetic transition in the many - body cpa treatment of the holstein - de model is quite heisenberg - like .",
    "however , this may not be the case for larger @xmath60 where , as discussed above , @xmath214 increases rapidly with @xmath60 .",
    "to compare our theoretical results with experiment we first note that the simple spin - wave dispersion in equation  ( [ eq:5 ] ) , which is of the heisenberg form , has been found to fit data on @xmath215 ( @xmath216 k ) throughout the brillouin zone @xcite . in this work the low temperature stiffness constant @xmath217 mev@xmath213 so that @xmath218 @xmath213 . in lsmo , also with @xmath219 , martin @xcite find @xmath220 k and @xmath221 mev@xmath213 ( at 27 k ) so that @xmath222 @xmath213 .",
    "@xmath223 seems to behave similarly with @xmath224 k , @xmath225 mev@xmath213 , @xmath226 @xmath213 @xcite .",
    "although @xmath6 in the last two materials is larger than in a heisenberg model , their spin dynamics near @xmath5 is quite conventional @xcite .",
    "however in some systems with lower @xmath5 this is not the case , and @xmath6 is considerably larger",
    ". thus in lcmo , with @xmath227 k ,",
    "@xmath228 mev@xmath213 , @xmath229 @xmath213 , the ferromagnetic transition seems not to be a standard second order one @xcite .",
    "also in nsmo , with @xmath230 k ,",
    "@xmath225 mev@xmath213 , @xmath231 @xmath213 , the spin - wave stiffness constant does not collapse to zero at @xmath146 @xcite , just as in lcmo @xcite .",
    "it is not clear whether such behaviour could occur within the holstein - de model or whether inhomogeneity due to disorder is important .",
    "however the larger values of @xmath6 predicted by the model for strong electron - phonon coupling suggests that something unusual is going on .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xmath3 may be underestimated by the many - body cpa for an intermediate electron - phonon coupling such as @xmath65 appropriate to lcmo .",
    "this is because spurious incoherent scattering near the fermi level reduces the `` kinetic energy '' @xmath130 , and hence @xmath3 . on the other hand equation  ( [ eq:6 ] ) itself",
    "gives an upper bound to @xmath3 which , in a better approximation will certainly be reduced . for the de model , in approximations equivalent to the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite , this is achieved by an additional negative term proportional to @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the hartree - fock exchange splitting between up and down spin bands . in the presence of an onsite coulomb interaction @xmath234 ,",
    "@xmath235 so that the negative term is considerably reduced .",
    "rpa estimates of @xmath3 in a two - band model differ widely @xcite .",
    "for the one - band model with @xmath30 and @xmath10 golosov @xcite has shown that @xmath3 is reduced to about half its @xmath46 value , over a wide range of band - filling , when magnon - electron scattering processes are considered .",
    "further work on @xmath3 in the holstein - de model is highly desirable .",
    "the many - body cpa treatment of the holstein - de model has been used to investigate several spectral properties which may be compared with experimental data on the manganites .",
    "we have been able to supply the theory which was hinted at by dessau @xcite in the discussion of their arpes measurements on the layered manganite @xmath0 in the low temperature ferromagnetic state .",
    "broad spectral peaks lie either side of a pseudogap at the fermi level and the pseudogap contains polaron subbands with exponentially small weight .",
    "one of these , at the fermi level , is responsible for the poor metallic behaviour",
    ". we therefore agree with alexandrov and bratkovsky @xcite that in this system , with unusually strong electron - phonon coupling , small polarons exist in the ferromagnetic state .",
    "however we find that small - polaron theory does not apply above or below @xmath5 in a pseudocubic manganite like @xmath1 with intermediate coupling strength .",
    "in particular the small - polaron result that the activation energy of the high - temperature dc conductivity is one - quarter of the peak photon energy in optical conductivity @xmath135 is found not to hold , in agreement with experiments on nsmo . the observed shift in spectral weight of @xmath135 to lower energy on going into the ferromagnetic state",
    "is found to occur , although it is somewhat suppressed by spurious incoherent scattering at @xmath2 which is a defect of the theory .",
    "a rigorous upper bound is derived for spin - wave energies at @xmath2 in the holstein - de model .",
    "it is shown that the spin - wave stiffness constant @xmath3 decreases with increasing electron - phonon coupling strength in a similar way to @xmath5 . however , for strong coupling the ratio @xmath6 increases quite rapidly with increasing coupling strength , i.e.with decreasing @xmath5 . this trend is found experimentally .",
