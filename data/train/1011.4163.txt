    "let us consider the following question : a group of people , living in the same country , but in different places , want to move in such a way that the distance among any two of them strictly decreases .",
    "unfortunately they can not all fit into one single house .",
    "hence , the constraints are :    a.   anyone can either move from his place to another one s ( no matter what the owner of the `` destination house '' does ) or stay where he is , b.   they can not all move to the same place .",
    "is it possible for them to move ?",
    "this question is a particular case of a more interesting problem involving discrete , possibly infinite , metric spaces ( we will come back to the original problem in section  [ sec : conclusions ] at the end of the paper ) .",
    "we say that a couple @xmath0 is a metric space if @xmath1 is a set and @xmath2 is real function , called _ distance _ , defined on @xmath3 such that ( 1 ) @xmath4 if and only if @xmath5 ( for all @xmath6 ) and ( 2 ) @xmath7 for all @xmath8 .",
    "we do not require the distance to be finite ; if @xmath9 we imagine that @xmath10 and @xmath11 belong to two disjoint components of the space ( see below a more detailed discussion on this , in the case of a graph ) . from ( 2 ) , with @xmath12 , and",
    "( 1 ) we have that @xmath13 ( for all @xmath14 ) hence @xmath2 is nonnegative .",
    "moreover , again from ( 2 ) , using @xmath15 , and ( 1 ) , we have that @xmath16 ( for all @xmath6 ) , thus , by symmetry , we have @xmath17 . for some basic properties of metric spaces",
    "see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 ) .",
    "an example of a discrete metric space is given by a ( nonoriented ) graph ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "roughly speaking , a graph is a ( finite or infinite ) collection of points , called _ vertices _ , along with a set of pairs of vertices , called _ edges_.",
    "we say that it is possible to move ( in one step ) from a vertex @xmath10 to a vertex @xmath11 if and only if @xmath18 is an edge .",
    "a _ path _ is a concatenation of edges , and the minimum number of steps required to go from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , say @xmath19 , is called _ natural distance _ from @xmath10 to @xmath11 . to be precise , in order to have an actual distance we have to assume that if we can move in one step from @xmath10 to @xmath11 then we can also go back in one step , that is , if @xmath18 is an edge then @xmath20 is an edge ( in this case the graph is called _ nonoriented _ ) .",
    "if we can go , in a finite number of steps , from @xmath10 to @xmath11 and back then we say that @xmath10 and @xmath11 _ communicate_. the set of vertices which communicate with @xmath10 is called the _ connected component _ containing @xmath10 ;",
    "if there is only one connected component , we say that the graph is _",
    "connected_. of course , if two vertices belong to two disjoint connected components then the distance between them is infinite . in figure  [ fig:1 ]",
    "there is an example of an infinite graph which is connected if the dashed arrow is an edge and it has two connected components otherwise ( the double arrows mean that you can move forth and back between the points , thus the graph is nonoriented ) .",
    "the central concept in this paper is the one of _ contractive map _ ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath21 be two metric spaces ; a function @xmath22 is _ contractive _ if and only if for any @xmath6 , such that @xmath23 , we have @xmath24 .",
    "the map is called a _ contraction _ if there exists @xmath25 such that @xmath26 for all @xmath6 .    roughly speaking a map is contractive if it ( stricly ) reduces the distances between points ; if the ratio of reduction has an upper bound which is ( stricly ) smaller than 1 , then we have a contraction . clearly , any contraction is a contractive map and the two classes coincide on finite metric spaces .",
    "we are ( mainly ) interested in the case @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "observe that in our original problem , if we denote by @xmath29 the new position of the person who was at @xmath10 before , what we are looking for are nonconstant , contractive maps .",
    "any constant map is trivially contractive ; when the converse is true ?    the main result theorem [ main ] characterizes all the discrete metric spaces , satisfying a certain property ( see below ) ) , which have nonconstant contractive maps .",
    "as a simply consequence of theorem  [ main ] we will see that every contractive map on a graph with the natural distance is a constant function if and only if the graph is connected .",
    "let us consider a discrete metric space @xmath0 ( which is a metric space such that for any given point @xmath30 it is possible to find @xmath31 such that @xmath32 for all @xmath33 ) and let us assume that @xmath34 ( the existence of the minimum is implicitly assumed ) .",
