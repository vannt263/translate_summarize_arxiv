    "the radial mode oscillation , being the simplest mode of neutron star has been considered first to be investigated more than 35 years ago @xcite . it can give information about stability of the stellar object under consideration .",
    "the radial modes of neutron star have been studied thoroughly by many authors for cold nuclear matter eos @xcite . with this radial modes",
    "have been investigated for other type of star , namely strange star @xcite protoneutron star @xcite , hybrid star @xcite .",
    "we here present our analysis of radial mode oscillation for realistic strange star ( ress ) equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "thirty five years ago chandrasekhar @xcite investigated these radial modes . following him we investigate the same for ress .",
    "the spherically symmetric metric is given by the line element ds^2 = -e^2 dt^2 + e^2 dr^2 + r^2 ( d ^2 + ^2 d^2 ) .",
    "together with the energy - momentum tensor for a perfect fluid , einstein s field equations yield the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations which can be solved if we have an eos , @xmath0 and @xmath1 . given the central density @xmath2",
    ", we can arrive at an @xmath3 curve by solving the tov . without disturbing the spherical symmetry of the background we define @xmath4 , a time dependent radial displacement of a fluid element located at the position @xmath5 in the unperturbed model which assumes a harmonic time dependence , as    r(r , t)= u_n(r ) e^i_n t.",
    "the dynamical equation governing the stellar pulsation in its @xmath6th normal mode ( @xmath7 , is the fundamental mode ) has the sturm - liouville s form ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "p(r ) + + u_n ( r ) = 0 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the amplitude and frequency of the @xmath6th normal mode , respectively .",
    "the functions @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are expressed in terms of the equilibrium configuration of the star and are given by    p(r ) = e^+3    q(r ) = e^+3    w =   e^3 + , where the varying adiabatic index @xmath13 is given by    = , @xmath14 and @xmath15 being the energy density and pressure of the unperturbed model , respectively .",
    "eigenfrequencies can be obtained with the boundary conditions ,    1 .   at the centre @xmath16 , @xmath17 and 2 .   at the surface",
    "@xmath18 leading to @xmath19 ,    since @xmath20 is real for @xmath21 , the solution is oscillatory .",
    "however for @xmath22 , the angular frequency @xmath23 is imaginary , which corresponds to an exponentially growing solution .",
    "this means that for negative values of @xmath24 the radial oscillations are unstable . for a compact star",
    "the fundamental mode @xmath25 becomes imaginary at some central density @xmath2 less than the critical density @xmath26 for which the total mass @xmath27 is a maximum . at @xmath28",
    ", @xmath25 vanishes .",
    "all higher modes are zero at even higher central densities .",
    "therefore , the star is unstable for central densities greater than @xmath29 . to illustrate ,",
    "we plot the eigen frequencies @xmath30 against @xmath2 , the central density in fig .",
    "the fundamental frequency @xmath25 does vanish at some @xmath29 while the higher modes remain nonzero .",
    "numerical values of masses , radii , central densities and the corresponding eigen frequencies @xmath25 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are given in tables [ eos1 ] and [ eos3 ] for eos1 and eos3 respectively ( ss1 and ss2 of dey et al .",
    "tables [ bag1 ] and [ bag2 ] are for the bag model eos with different parameters .",
    "ress are stable against radial oscillations close to the maximum attainable mass .",
    "for example , the eos of ss1 sustains gravitationally , @xmath33 , r=7 km with a central number density @xmath34 .",
    "however , the fundamental frequency of radial oscillations becomes zero at around @xmath35 , destabilizing the star after m=1.36 @xmath36 with r= 7.24 km ( table [ eos1 ] ) .",
    "it is still on the @xmath37 region .",
    "thus the maximum mass star which is stable against radial oscillations has a number density @xmath38 at the centre and @xmath39 at the surface .",
    "macroscopically , upto this density small vibrations may be sustained ."
