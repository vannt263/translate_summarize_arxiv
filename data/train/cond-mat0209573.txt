    "recently , the unique properties of ferroelectric relaxors have become one of the central topics in solid state physics .",
    "the diffuseness of the dielectric response against temperature variation has been considered to be due to the randomness of the system created by the random occupation of b - site ions with different valences .",
    "in fact , the basic physics of relaxors has been mainly discussed in terms of ` random field ' to stabilize a glassy state analogous to spin glasses .",
    "one of the intriguing problems to be answered is the role of @xmath0 -ions on a - site . in spite of the efforts to eliminate pb ion based on technological reasons ,",
    "hitherto known perovskite relaxors seem to be restricted to pb compounds , which suggests that at least part of the unique properties would be related to pb ions at a - site .    from experimental view point ,",
    "there exist a few unique features exhibited by relaxors both in structural as well as lattice dynamical aspects providing some ` key concepts ' to describe characteristic features of relaxors .",
    "the key concept to discuss the static structure of relaxors is the so - called pnr ( polar nanoregion ) .",
    "that is , the averaged cubic symmetry is locally broken in the temperature region where dielectric constant exhibits broad maximum .",
    "the overall structure is thus visualized as a random distribution of pnr embedded on cubic parent phase .",
    "we notice that there are a few materials which show similar intrinsic heterogeneity in the vicinity of phase transition point .",
    "a group of bcc - based alloys called shape memory alloys , which undergo martensitic transformation , exhibit heterogeneous structure where the  embryo s or microdomains of martensite are embedded on the austenite ( bcc ) matrix over a wide temperature range .",
    "more recently , a group of perovskite manganites called cmr substances , which undergo metal - insulator transition , have been noticed to develop heterogeneous structure@xcite where microdomains of metallic phase are coexisting with insulator phase . the close relationship between cmr substances and relaxors",
    "was already pointed out by kimura et al.@xcite    onuki@xcite investigated the origin of the stability of two - phase coexistence in alloys and pointed out that the coupling between the order parameter to the local strain is essential to stabilize the heterogeneous structure .",
    "later , yamada and takakura@xcite also arrived at the same conclusion in the case of cmr substances .    in this connection , the recent neutron scattering study on pmn by hirota et al.@xcite seems to be very suggestive .",
    "they carried out the dynamical structure analysis of the diffuse scattering and concluded that the displacement pattern of each ion in the unit cell contains considerable amount of cm ( center of mass ) non - conserving components . in the language of phonon modes , it means that the normal coordinate of the condensing mode is given by a linear combination of to - mode and ta - mode suggesting the possibility of strong polarization - strain coupling .    on the other hand ,",
    "the key concept to characterize the dynamical aspect of relaxors is so - called ` waterfall ' in phonon spectrum .",
    "gehring et al.@xcite carried out the pioneering neutron scattering study on pzn-8pt and found out that the observed high intensity ridge of the neutron spectrum did not follow the expected to phonon dispersion at @xmath3 .",
    "instead , it falls down vertically to precipitate onto ta dispersion .",
    "similar features are successively observed in various relaxors including pmn and pzn,@xcite indicating that waterfall is indeed the unique lattice dynamical characteristic of relaxors .",
    "gehring et al.@xcite analyzed the neutron spectrum of pzn based on the ` mode coupling ' treatment which was utilized by harada et al.@xcite to explain the phonon spectrum of @xmath4 .",
    "they concluded that in order to reproduce the observed spectrum , the to phonon width should show an abrupt change at @xmath5 where waterfall takes place .",
    "they claim that the abrupt change is caused by the random distribution of pnr in the medium , thereby the propagation of the lattice wave with wave length longer than the average size of pnr is impeded . while this viewpoint is very attractive , whether the static heterogeneity such as pnr will cause waterfall type anomaly or not is unclear since a static entity will only give rise to large momentum transfer of the phonon without causing any energy transfer from phonons to other freedom of motion and eventually to heat bath . in order to establish effective channels of energy transfer , some dynamical entity to which phonons are coupled would be needed .",
    "we consider that the configurational freedom of motion of @xmath0-ion will provide such possibility .",
    "it is known@xcite that in relaxors the instantaneous equilibrium position of @xmath0 ion is slightly shifted from the high symmetry corner site and is making random hopping motion between the equivalent off - center sites to recover cubic symmetry on average .",
    "formally , such freedom of motion can be expressed by a stochastic pseudospin variable .",
    "based on these considerations we construct a suitable model of the relaxor which is characterized by ` coupled to - ta - pseudospin system ' . in the next section , we discuss the to - ta coupling within the framework of ` quasi - harmonic ' approximation which was utilized by axe , harada and shirane ( ahs)@xcite in order to analyze the anomalous ta dispersion in @xmath6 .",
    "when applied to pmn , this treatment suggests the possibility to stabilize a heterogeneous static structure . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the neutron scattering spectra including waterfall anomaly by taking into account of random hopping of @xmath0 ions .",
    "the last section is devoted to conclusions and discussions .",
    "according to the analysis of the diffuse scattering intensities observed in pmn around various reciprocal lattice points by hirota et al.,@xcite the structure factor of the condensing mode includes substantial amount of atomic displacements which does not conserve the center of mass ( cm ) of the unit cell .",
    "since the optical modes at @xmath7 should satisfy the condition of cm - conservation of the coordinates , the above observation seems to suggest that in pmn , there would be strong coupling between the soft optical mode and the transverse acoustic mode around @xmath7 , so that the normal coordinates include considerable amount of cm - nonconserving displacements . in this connection",
    ", we notice that there are a few perovskite ferroelectric materials , which exhibit anomalous behavior in the ta branch upon softening of the to branch .",
    "1 shows typical behavior in the case of @xmath6.@xcite it is seen that as the to mode softens , the dispersion of the ta branch exhibits anomalous ` concave ' curve in a limited @xmath8-region of @xmath9 .",
    "it is noticeable that the dispersion shows no ` softening ' in the vicinity of the reciprocal lattice point within @xmath10 .",
    "such anomaly in the ta dispersion also indicates the possibility of strong coupling between to- and ta- modes in perovskite ferroelectric systems .     at 300k and 20k given in ref .",
    "as the to branch ` softens ' upon lowering temperature , the ta branch exhibits anomalous concave curve in a limited @xmath8-region of @xmath11 .",
    "notice the dispersion shows no anomaly in the direct vicinity of the zone center @xmath12 within @xmath10.,width=139,height=359 ]    in 1970 , axe et al.@xcite discussed the anomalous behavior of ta branch in @xmath6 in the framework of ` quasi - harmonic coupling ' treatment .",
    "they express the dynamical matrix @xmath13 of the harmonic potential by taking the normal coordinates at @xmath7 as the basis functions .",
    "the off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath14 may then be considered as the mode - mode coupling energy between the @xmath15th and @xmath16th modes . by taking only ta - to coupling into account the phonon properties ( characteristic frequency and the corresponding normal coordinates )",
    "are explicitly given by solving the following secular equation :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the soft mode frequency at @xmath7 which is the only temperature dependent quantity .",
    "@xmath19 are to be expanded in terms of @xmath20 as :    @xmath21    @xmath22    along a specific direction @xmath23 .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath24 s may be obtained by comparing with the experimental dispersion curves at high temperatures where no anomaly is observed . in particular , @xmath25 is directly given by the elastic constant for shear strain along @xmath23-direction .",
    "the only essential parameters to be fixed are @xmath26 s with @xmath27 describing the coupling between to- and ta- modes .",
    "axe et al.@xcite analyzed the experimental results on @xmath6 and successfully reproduced the ta , as well as to , dispersions at various temperatures by fitting these two parameters .",
    "we further notice that the off - diagonal matrix elements of the transformation matrix of the basis functions , @xmath28 , become comparable to the diagonal ones in the @xmath8-region where the ta branch exhibits anomalous behavior .",
    "for instance , @xmath28 at @xmath29 in @xmath6 is given by ,    @xmath30    this means that in the @xmath8-region where anomaly in ta dispersion takes place the normal coordinate of to - mode contains large amount of uniform translational displacements , and vice versa .",
    "( ta - mode contains large amount of pure optical displacements . )",
    "this behavior reminds us the characteristics of the dynamical structure factors as pointed out by hirota et al . in the case of pmn .",
    "it is noticeable that @xmath31 , the prototype material of perovskite relaxors , was reported@xcite to exhibit the same type anomaly in ta dispersion .",
    "therefore , it would not be unreasonable to assume that perovskite relaxors also belong to the materials which experience strong to - ta coupling .",
    "unfortunately , such anomaly can not be proved directly by the observation of neutron spectra in relaxors because of the extraordinarily large damping characterized by the ` waterfall ' phenomena .    at this stage , we try to construct the ` hypothetical ' dispersion curves of pmn within the ` quasi - harmonic ' coupling formalism by completely neglecting the anharmonicity of the potential to cause damping . among the parameters defined in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , @xmath25 is unambiguously given by the observed elastic constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath23 // [ 100 ] and @xmath23 // [ 110 ] respectively.@xcite the remaining @xmath34s are assumed to be isotropic ( independent of @xmath23 ) and to take the same values as those for @xmath6 given by axe et al ..    the results of calculation are given in fig .",
    "the dispersion of ta [ 100 ] shows the expected concave curve .",
    "in contrast , the dispersion of ta [ 110 ] exhibits a ` dip ' around @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , by subtle adjustment of the parameters , the dip becomes more pronounced so that @xmath36 at @xmath37 .",
    "that is , the ta mode has become ` condensed ' to form a modulated static structure with modulation period @xmath38 .     determined by the observed elastic constants@xcite along [ 100 ] and [ 110]-directions .",
    "the dotted curve corresponds to the case when the coupling parameters are slightly modified from the values determined for @xmath6.,width=302,height=226 ]    the transformation matrix at @xmath39 is calculated to give    @xmath40    therefore the local structure of the condensing ta mode is expressed as the linear combination of uniform translational and pure optical displacements with the ratio of @xmath41 .",
    "physically , this implies that the ta [ 110 ] mode with the wave length of nanometer order , @xmath42 , has the tendency to become unstable prior to the condensation of the uniform @xmath12 to - mode due to the quasiharmonic coupling .",
    "hence the system eventually stabilizes a polarization / strain modulated structure with wave length @xmath42 . as has been pointed out , such characteristics of the phonon dispersions are not able to be observed by inelastic neutron scattering experiment obscured by the large damping . on the other hand , x- ray diffuse scattering intensity , which is proportional to the instantaneous correlation of fluctuations , seems to give some indirect information on the characteristic frequency @xmath43 .",
    "the x - ray intensity due to the excitation of the phonons belonging to @xmath44th branch is given , irrespective of the property of damping,@xcite as    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the dynamical structure factor of the @xmath44th mode .",
    "in the present system , where ta - mode , rather than to , is assumed to become extremely soft , we may express the x - ray diffuse intensity around each bragg point , @xmath47 , in the form :    @xmath48    @xmath49    where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the dynamical structure factors for the pure translational , and pure optical displacements at @xmath7 respectively .",
    "3(a ) shows the calculated x - ray diffuse scattering intensity distributions around three bragg positions in comparison with the observed x - ray results by you et al .. ( fig .",
    "3(b)).@xcite while overall characteristics of anisotropic distribution are reproduced qualitatively , a remarkable discrepancy is seen in the diffuse pattern around ( 400 ) .",
    "the observed distribution does not show any clear existence of ` satellites ' which are shown in the calculated contour .",
    "this point will be discussed later .    although it is not shown explicitly in the figure , the relative intensities of the diffuse pattern reflects the degree of mixing of the modes , through the structure factors .",
    "hirota et al.@xcite gave the relative displacement for each ions in the unit cell which are divided into cm - conserving ( to - like ) and cm - nonconserving ( ta - like ) components ( see eq .",
    "( 6 ) in ref . 5 ) . using the table ,",
    "the experimental value of @xmath52 is obtained as 0.63 , which should be compared with the calculated value of 0.50 ( see eq .",
    "the neutron spectrum of pmn along [ 100 ] in the temperature region where ` waterfall ' phenomenon takes place has been analyzed by gehling et al.@xcite based on the coupled mode treatment utilized by harada et al . to discuss the asymmetric spectra in @xmath4 . in this treatment , there are five adjustable parameters to be fitted to the observed neutron intensity profile for each @xmath53-value .",
    "it has been shown that , in order to reproduce the entire intensity distribution in the observed @xmath8-range , the effective width of to - mode , @xmath54 , changes abruptly at @xmath55 where ` waterfall ' takes place .",
    "they claim that the abrupt increase of @xmath56 would be caused by inhomogeneity of the lattice due to random distribution of pnr with characteristic size of @xmath57 .",
    "while this interpretation is very attractive , the basis of the ` coupled mode ' formalism on which the treatment is based , is a ` homogeneous anharmonic lattice ' .",
    "the damping of phonons are caused by the energy flow to the heat bath through anharmonic potential , whence the static heterogeneity of the medium would be out of the framework of the treatment .",
    "we take somewhat different standpoint . besides the phonon system",
    ", we introduce a stochastic variable whose dynamical behavior is only statistically determined .",
    "when such variable is strongly coupled to phonons , the life time of phonons would be mainly determined by the energy flow to the heat bath through the random variable . in perovskite relaxors , the configurational freedom of @xmath0 ions seems to play the role of such stochastic variable since it is well established@xcite that the instantaneous equilibrium position of @xmath0 ion is slightly displaced from the corner site due to covalency effect , and it is randomly hopping across the potential barrier between the equivalent off - centered sites allowed by the averaged cubic symmetry m3 m .",
    "we may describe this freedom of motion of @xmath0 ion by a pseudospin which takes on a few distinct values .",
    "thus , our standpoint is schematically envisaged as illustrated in fig.4 .        as the suitable framework to treat the coupled to - ta - pseudospin system , we utilize langevin equation which describes the motion of the variable under random force @xmath58 ,    @xmath59    @xmath60\\cdot{\\bm \\chi}^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the state vector whose components are given by the independent variables of the system ,",

    "it is shown that when the relaxation time of random hopping of @xmath0 ions between the equivalent off - center sites is comparable to the to phonon frequency at @xmath102 , the calculated phonon spectral density reproduces the characteristic features called ` waterfall ' which was observed by neutron spectra in pmn and pzn .",
    "+   + in this paper , we have discussed the possible origin of intrinsic heterogeneity in relaxors in terms of ta mode instability .",
    "since the energy is simply assumed in a quadratic form , the resultant heterogeneity is expressed by a harmonic modulation .",
    "when higher order terms are taken into account , the modulation would become more or less ` kink'-like producing well defined boundary between the polar and non - polar regions .",
    "recently , yamada and takakura investigated the origin of ic phase and two - phase coexistence in @xmath103 ( cmr substance ) observed around metal - insulator phase boundary based on tdgl formalism . without the higher order coupling between 3d - orbital of @xmath104 ion and local strain , the system stabilizes a regular ic structure .",
    "however when the higher order electron - phonon coupling is taken into account , a two - phase coexistent state is stabilized in which metallic nanoregion is embedded randomly on the parent insulator phase .",
    "similar features would be expected in relaxors .",
    "particularly , the random distribution of b - site ions provides the random pinning center to fix the ` kink ' ( domain boundary ) position , which will enhance the randomness of the spatial heterogeneity .",
