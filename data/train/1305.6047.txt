    "the paper is organized as follows : the observations and the data reduction are described in section  [ obs_red ] , the survey results in section  [ survey_results ] and the conclusions are presented in section  [ conc ] .",
    "the observations were carried out with the mwa 32 element (  tile \" , 32 t ) prototype , located in the outback of western australia at the murchison radio observatory , and took place on september 21st 2010 , for a total of @xmath58  hours during the night , starting at ut = 14@xmath12 .",
    "the 32 tiles were arranged in a circular configuration which provides fairly uniform @xmath13 coverage up to the maximum baseline of @xmath5350  m. each tile consists of 16 dual - polarization , active dipole antennas laid out over a metal mesh ground screen in a @xmath14 grid with a 1.1 meter centre - to - centre spacing and can be steered electronically through an analogue beam former that introduces appropriate delays and attenuations for each individual dipole @xcite .",

    "after the 189  mhz measurements were reported on the 160  mhz scale , we found an rms difference of @xmath17% for sources brighter than 5  jy at 189  mhz which decreases down to @xmath18% for sources brighter than 10  jy .",
    "the scatter between the two data sets broadens near to the 4  jy threshold as a combination of the decrease in signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and of the source selection criteria .",

    "@xcite detected 23 polarized point sources brighter than 3  mjy at 350  mhz , with an average polarization fraction of @xmath21% .",
    "based on these limited numbers and their sky coverage , one would expect to have one polarized source every four square degrees with an average polarization fraction of a few percent",
    ". that would not seem to change significantly between 1.4  ghz and 350  mhz .",
    "we used rm synthesis to investigate the point source polarization fraction at 189  mhz .",
    "we filtered out most of the large scale diffuse emission by retaining only the baselines longer than @xmath540  wavelengths .",
    "the source pmn  j0351 - 2744 clearly showed a 320  mjy peak at @xmath22  rad  m@xmath6 ( see figure  [ fig : faraday_spectrum ] ) .",
    "this value is in agreement with the rm  @xmath23  rad  m@xmath6 measured by @xcite at 1.4  ghz for this source whereas @xcite found an rm  @xmath24  rad  m@xmath6 at 1.4  ghz .",
    "the close agreement between the rm magnitude from the current work , @xcite and @xcite suggests that there is a possible sign error in the determination of @xcite .",
    "observations of a linearly polarized source is essential for the correction of the unknown relative phase between the @xmath25 and @xmath26 polarizations @xcite .",
    "an uncalibrated phase between the two polarizations leads to a leakage of stokes @xmath2 into @xmath27 and consequent depolarization .",
    "we used pmn  j0351 - 2744 to correct for the relative @xmath25-@xmath26 phase and obtain a full polarization calibration ( the details are provided in appendix  a ) .    at 189  mhz ,",
    "faraday rotation due to the ionosphere can induce fluctuations in the measured rm , causing depolarization when the stokes parameters are averaged over time .",
    "this effect is both time and direction dependent and , in order to be corrected across the very wide mwa field of view , would require a grid of calibration sources used to monitor the ionospheric behaviour . in the present analysis",
    "we were limited to estimate the impact of ionospheric faraday rotation towards pmn  j0351 - 2744 as it passed through the primary beam , by computing its rm for every 5  min snapshot ( figure  [ fig : ion_corr ] ) .",
    "we found that the rm variations as a function of time have an rms of 1.8 rad  m@xmath6 for one hour of data .",
    "we note , however , the rm peak shows arcmin displacements as a function of time , suggesting that the observed rm variations might not only be due to ionospheric faraday rotation .",
    "temporal variations of the observed polarized intensity trace the rm variations fairly well .",
    "we estimated the depolarization due to rm fluctuations induced by the ionosphere by taking the ratio between the brightest peak at ha@xmath50.5  h and the polarized intensity measured in the time integrated image and found a 53% depolarization fraction . correcting the time - integrated polarized intensity for this fraction ,",
    "leads to a polarization fraction of @xmath4% for pmn  j0351 - 2744 .",
    "we searched for polarization in all the sources brighter than 4  jy listed in table  [ source_cat ] without any detection . assuming five times the thermal noise as detection threshold",
    ", the polarization fraction is below @xmath52% for 4  jy sources . for the brightest sources",
    "the systematic error becomes a limiting factor over thermal sensitivity .",
    "we therefore adopted an average value of 2% as upper limit on the polarization fraction for all the radio sources in our catalogue .",
    "depolarization at low frequency is likely to be caused by both depth and beam depolarization .",
    "depth depolarization ( also called differential faraday dispersion ) occurs when the emitting and rotation regions are co - located in a ordered magnetic field .",
    "the polarization plane of the radiation emitted at the far side of the region undergoes a different amount of faraday rotation compared to the polarized radiation coming from the near side , causing depolarization when the emission is integrated over the entire region . for a plasma with uniform density and uniform magnetic field",
    ", the polarization fraction @xmath28 is @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the intrinsic polarization fraction .",
    "beam depolarization occurs when the polarization angle changes significantly within the psf .",
    "the change can be either intrinsic to the source or caused by an external foreground faraday screen . both magnetic field or electron density variations with cells smaller than the psf produce depolarization according to @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the rm dispersion across the source on the sky .",
    "the depolarization ratio between 1.4  ghz and 189  mhz for pmn  j0351 - 2744 is @xmath33 and can be caused by either a @xmath34  rad  m@xmath6 in the case of internal faraday dispersion or by a @xmath35  rad  m@xmath6 in case of beam depolarization .",
    "we re - analyzed archival data of pmn j0351 - 2744 observed with the australia telescope compact array at 1.4  ghz @xcite that resolve the source structure in rm and show variations across the source itself , spanning the @xmath36  rad  m@xmath6 range ( figure  [ fig : atca ] ) .",
    "this result further confirms that our polarization calibration gives the correct sign for the source rm at 189  mhz .",
    "the observed rm variations across the source have a @xmath37  rad  m@xmath6 , sufficient to depolarize the source when integrated over the psf of the 32 t array , therefore beam depolarization seems a more likely explanation over depth depolarization in this case .",
    "the polarization fraction of the remaining compact sources is below 2% , whereas it is 7% at 1.4  ghz .",
    "their general depolarization mechanism is not well constrained by our observations .",
    "@xcite estimated the galactic rm contribution on 1 - 2  arcmin scales to a sample of selected 3c sources .",
    "the sample at @xmath38 has @xmath39  rad  m@xmath6 and he found that no galactic foreground could explain these fluctuations , whereas sources at @xmath40 has @xmath41  rad  m@xmath6 .",
    "he concluded that rm fluctuations at high galactic latitudes happen at the source and , as we have shown above , they can beam depolarize the emission . on the other hand , internal faraday dispersion can not be ruled out either , because it can generate complete depolarization for @xmath42  rad  m@xmath6 which is not uncommon in radio sources ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "multifrequency , higher resolution observations are needed to distinguish between the two mechanisms .",
    "fornax  a ( ngc  1316 ) is a very well studied radio source , which lies at the outskirts of the fornax cluster . at optical wavelengths it appears as a d - type galaxy @xcite and",
    "it has been been extensively observed at many radio frequencies . @xcite and @xcite resolved its structure at 408 and 1415  mhz respectively , with arcminute resolution .",
    "they identified two radio lobes , a bridge that connects them and a compact core .",
    "@xcite studied its total intensity and polarized emission at 1.51  ghz with 14  arcsec angular resolution .",
    "fornax  a transits 11@xmath43 away from zenith at the mwa location and our primary beam model is still valid at that distance .",
    "it was deconvolved by identifying clean - like components at the center of each image pixel .",
    "a synthesized beam at the location of the pixel centre was generated for each component , a scaled version of the synthesized beam was subtracted and a new component searched for .",
    "this deconvolution scheme is therefore similar to the forward modeling described in section  [ forward_modeling ] if we exclude the fit for the position .",
    "a residual rms floor of @xmath52.5  jy  beam@xmath3 was reached even without including correlation among adjacent pixels @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fornaxa ] shows the 189  mhz contour map of fornax a overlaid with the 1.51  ghz image @xcite , convolved to the mwa 32 t resolution .",
    "the two images were overlapped by finding the best fit overall offset in @xmath44 using the miriad task imdiff @xcite .",
    "we corrected for an overall 4  arcmin offset in declination , compatible with the coordinate offset found in section  [ culgoora_comparison ] for point sources .",
    "a similar morphology emerges from the comparison of the two images . at 14  arcsec resolution ,",
    "the radio lobes have sharp edges , with the west lobe brighter than the east lobe and an unresolved core emission .",
    "when it is smoothed down to the 32 t resolution , only the two lobes remain visible and their sharp edges are smoothed out .",
    "the size of the lobes at 189  mhz and 1.51  ghz is consistent , suggesting that little evolution occurs in the electron population .",
    "we notice that the peak of the faintest lobe is displaced by @xmath57  arcmin between the two frequencies .",
    "this might be an indication of frequency evolution of the relativistic particles , but it is difficult to draw a firmer conclusion because of the limited angular resolution .",
    "we measured the integrated flux over the source to be @xmath45  jy and compared it with previous measurements at other frequencies ( figure  [ fig : fornaxa_spectrum ] ) .",
    "our measurement is in very good agreement with the spectrum between 5 and 1415  mhz .",
    "it appears very smooth and does not show indications of a turnover even at very low frequencies .",
    "two data points at 100  mhz and one data point at 400  mhz appear unexpectedly low and might be affected by systematic errors . after excluding these values",
    ", a second order polynomial of the form @xmath46 is the best fit to the frequency spectrum over three decades in frequency .",
    "if we included data between 30 and 400  mhz and fit a power law spectrum , we found a spectral index @xmath47 .",
    "the rms difference between a power law and the best fit model is 0.3% over the mwa frequency range .",
    "this is an important result because radio sources are going to be used to obtain beam calibration for low frequency arrays ( cf .",
    "section  [ primary_beam ] ) and most of them show deviations from a pure power law behaviour over several decades in frequency ( i.e , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if they could be approximated with power law spectra with negligible errors , the requirements of accurate spectral models would be alleviated even when very precise beam calibration is required as for eor observations .    finally , we investigated polarization from fornax  a through rm synthesis .",
    "we found no evidence of polarized emission above three times the noise at any faraday depth , indicating that the polarization fraction of the lobes is below 1% .    at 1.51",
    "ghz the lobes are 20% polarized on average and show a spatially rich pattern with filaments and depolarization areas @xcite .",
    "rm values between -15 and + 10  rad  m@xmath6 are common across the lobes with variations greater than 20  rad  m@xmath6 in the most depolarized regions @xcite .",
    "a conservative value of @xmath48  rad  m@xmath6 across the lobes would be sufficient to completely depolarize the emission at 189  mhz within the mwa 32 t psf , indicating that beam depolarization causes the observed depolarization at low frequencies .",
    "galactic polarized emission is a very powerful probe of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and a possible contamination for eor measurements @xcite .    diffuse polarized emission",
    "has been observed in large areas of the sky at 350  mhz on scales greater than 5  arcmin and at the level of several mk rms @xcite .",
    "a characteristic feature of low frequency radio polarization is the lack of correlation with total intensity emission , generally interpreted as the effect of foreground ism clouds which rotate a smooth polarized background but leave the total intensity background untouched and , therefore , resolved out by the interferometric sampling @xcite .",
    "recent observations at 150  mhz revealed polarization rich @xcite as well as unpolarized regions @xcite .",
    "polarized emission was found to be fainter than expected on the basis of a simple power law extrapolation from the 350  mhz data , suggesting that depolarization occurs . the current understanding of the global properties of the polarized ism at low frequencies is , however , still limited by the scarcely available data .",
    "our observations cover a @xmath49 strip at galactic latitude ( @xmath50 ) , the largest polarization survey to date below 200  mhz .",
    "rm synthesis was extended to the whole survey in order to map galactic polarization .",
    "all the compact sources brighter than 5  jy in total intensity were peeled and , in this way , their instrumental polarization contribution to the rm synthesis was removed .",
    "the baselines shorter than 15 wavelengths were down weighted in order to suppress the very large scale emission .",
    "this weight gives sensitivity to emission up to @xmath54@xmath43  scales .",
    "direction dependent instrumental polarization over the wide field of view is dealt with as described in @xcite and , assuming that the measured phase between the @xmath25 and @xmath26 polarizations is direction independent ( cf .",
    "section  [ point_source_polarization ] and appendix a ) , the calibration derived from pmn  j0351 - 2744 holds across the whole survey .",
    "the final stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 maps were not corrected for ionospheric faraday rotation , therefore they measure only a relative polarization angle .",
    "we detected diffuse polarized emission over many degrees on the sky , varying with galactic latitude over a factor of 20 , from the brightest peaks at @xmath513  k  rmsf@xmath3 down to the thermal noise ( figure  [ fig : rm_0 ] and [ fig : rm_1 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , most of the emission occurs at a small range of faraday depths across the whole survey , essentially in the @xmath51  rad  m@xmath6 range .",
    "it has a patchy and partly filamentary structure where the size of the patches can be as big as a couple of degrees down to the psf size .",
    "fainter , patchy polarized emission with peaks up to @xmath52  k  rmsf@xmath3 appears at @xmath52 up to @xmath53  rad  m@xmath6 .",
    "the emission is interspersed by voids in polarization , similar to the canals described by @xcite .",
    "such morphology was recently explained as sharp gradients in stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 caused by localized high values of the gas density and magnetic field , resulting from vorticity or shear in the ism in a sub - sonic regime @xcite .",
    "a detailed model of the ism components is beyond the scope of the present paper and will be explored in a future publication , but we briefly consider the nature and the distance of the observed polarized emission .    the only polarization data available in the southern hemisphere at frequencies close to 189  mhz is the 408  mhz survey carried out with the parkes telescope at @xmath540  arcmin resolution @xcite .",
    "its area overlaps with a large part of our survey , at @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "galactic polarization appears smooth at 408  mhz , with 1 - 3  k brightness levels over the area at @xmath56 and @xmath57 , extending to the area at @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "very little polarization is detected at @xmath60 and @xmath61 , whereas the peak of the emission is @xmath56  k at @xmath62-wide area centred at @xmath63 .",
    "the comparison of polarization observations at different frequencies with different sampling in angular scales is complicated because it can mix beam and depth depolarization , however , both surveys show a similar trend . the small scale details are rather different though , for instance",
    ", at 189  mhz there is no correlation with the 6  k peak observed at 408  mhz .",
    "if we assume an average level of emission of @xmath53  k at 408  mhz and the polarized emission to have a spectral index of @xmath64 like the total intensity @xcite , we would expect an average brightness of @xmath520  k at 189  mhz , which is even higher than the brightest peaks observed .",
    "depolarization at 189  mhz could be due to a resolved large - scale polarized background , depth and beam depolarization .",
    "the presence of depolarization indicates that polarized emission at 189  mhz comes from the foreground ism compared to the 408  mhz data and has a more local origin .",
    "@xcite introduced the concept of  polarization horizon \" as the distance beyond which most of the emission is depolarized when it reaches the observer .",
    "generally , the distance of the polarization horizon can be affected by both beam and depth depolarization , and both effects depend upon the observing frequency and the angular resolution . at 1.4",
    "ghz the polarization horizon is @xmath65  kpc @xcite but it shrinks down to @xmath66  pc at 408  mhz @xcite and at 350  mhz @xcite .",
    "we used the 189  mhz emission to constrain the distance of the polarization horizon at very low frequencies . assuming a magnetic field of 2 - 4@xmath67 g and an electron density of 0.05 - 0.08  @xmath68 @xcite",
    ", the maximum @xmath69  rad  m@xmath6 observed in our data constrains the polarized emission to be more local than @xmath5120  pc .",
    "an independent estimate of the distance of the polarization horizon can be inferred from a comparison with rms of pulsars with known distances . given the high galactic latitude coverage of the 189  mhz survey ,",
    "there are only six pulsars with measured rm within the survey coverage @xcite .",
    "four pulsars have rms between + 13 and + 50  rad  m@xmath6 and a distance greater than 1.3  kpc and two of them are closer than few hundred parsecs and have rms of + 5 and + 30  rad  m@xmath6 respectively . given the very small sample available , we can not draw statistically robust conclusions , but pulsar rms have the same sign as the diffuse polarization and seem to support a distance of the polarization horizon in agreement with what was estimated by using rms of the diffuse emission .",
    "one of the main science drivers of low frequency radio observations is the measurement of the 21  cm line from the eor .",
    "all the current models predict a cosmological signal that peaks at @xmath510  mk in the 100 - 200  mhz ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , therefore the deconvolution and subtraction of the bright foreground sky is the crucial step to measure the underlying faint cosmological signal ( for a review on the topic , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "section  [ culgoora_comparison ] showed that forward modeling recovers the flux of bright sources fairly well , however , for precision spectral studies such as the eor , the deconvolution should also not introduce any artifacts into the frequency domain .",
    "this requirement is difficult given the strong chromatic features of the mwa antennas . in this section",
    "we use some of the techniques developed for eor power spectrum analyses to test the spectral properties of the bright source deconvolution and to characterize the remaining residuals .",
    "the image cubes we used in this section have not been corrected by the baseline distribution as they would need to in order to be compared with the eor signal ; we leave the full power spectrum analysis of the survey data with baseline weights and error propagation for a future paper .",
    "the first step in the power spectrum analysis is to create a three dimensional cube in fourier ( or @xmath70 ) space by mapping the frequency dimension to line - of - sight distance ( i.e. the distance of the redshifted 21  cm line at that frequency ) and then taking a three dimensional fourier transform .",
    "we used the following definitions @xcite :    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is the baseline length in wavelengths .",
    "we have assumed a flat universe @xmath73 and the transverse comoving distance @xmath74 as : @xmath75 in equation  [ k_def ] and  [ dm_def ] , @xmath76 is the hubble constant , @xmath77  mhz is the rest frequency of the 21  cm line , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the matter and dark energy content respectively .    while the eor signal is expected to be spherically symmetric in @xmath80 space , the astrophysical sources have a very different geometry because they are expected to be spectrally smooth @xcite . the difference in these geometries is most easily seen by averaging in circular shells in the @xmath81 and @xmath82 directions to produce two dimensional plots of power in @xmath83  vs  @xmath84 space ( figure  [ fig : coldpatch ] ) .",
    "these plots are a useful representation because the spectrally smooth foregrounds appear predominantly in the lowest @xmath85 bin .",
    "a fraction of the observed power is scattered up by the chromatic response of the instrument into higher bins in a characteristic  wedge \" @xcite .",
    "this wedge leaves an  eor window \" open that is relatively free of contamination .",
    "we computed the power spectrum from a @xmath86 sky patch centred at @xmath87 , which was previously indicated by @xcite as an area with low galactic foreground emission .",
    "this patch has an rms of 11.5  k in the frequency averaged image ( figure  [ fig : final_mosaic ] ) .",
    "2d power spectra with 0.64  mhz frequency resolution are shown in figure  [ fig : coldpatch ] before and after the deconvolution of bright point sources , where the ratio between the stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 rms per frequency channels is approximately a factor of five .",
    "the decrease in power at large @xmath88 is due to the drop off in the number of baselines at those scales , since the cubes have not been weighted to remove this effect .",
    "point source deconvolution removed most of the power at small @xmath80 values , below the wedge ( figure  [ fig : coldpatch_ratio ] ) .",
    "the eor window above the wedge remained unaffected .",

    "the pca determines the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath92 : @xmath97 where the eigenvectors are the columns of @xmath98 and @xmath99 is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues in decreasing order , i.e. @xmath100 . the sky model at each frequency is represented by a vector @xmath101 defined as : @xmath102 the eigenvectors are sorted by the corresponding eigenvalues in decreasing order , such that the first few eigenvectors are the dominant spectral shapes in the image cubes and represent most of the power .",
    "we found that the first five eigenvectors account for 60% of the power , indicating that the power in the image cubes is not as highly concentrated in just a few eigenvectors as it is in @xcite model , where the first three components contain @xmath599% of the total power .",
    "this may be caused by structure introduced by sidelobes not suppressed by the limited @xmath13 coverage of the drift scan survey or imperfect calibration of the array frequency response .",
    "to evaluate the effect of the dominant modes on the power spectra , we subtracted the contribution of the first five eigenvectors from the residual image cube .",

    "in section  [ wi_fi_pol ] we showed that the diffuse polarized emission decreases significantly at @xmath7 . polarized peaks up to 2  k  rmsf@xmath3",
    "can be observed along individual lines of sight , but the polarized fluctuation rms decreases by approximately a factor of four when moving away from the south galactic pole .",
    "we integrated the polarized emission over the @xmath51  rad  m@xmath6 range and found that the rms of polarization fluctuations is below 1  k.    @xcite described a way to remove polarized emission that leaks into the total intensity and , potentially , corrupts the eor signal . polarized emission at small @xmath52 values can directly be filtered out by applying a high - pass filter in @xmath52 space and polarized emission at high @xmath52 values deconvolved from the rmsf in @xmath52 space .",
    "the characteristics of the polarized emission observed throughout the surveyed sky area are consistent with the assumptions of @xcite both in terms of intensity and rm distribution , suggesting that polarized foregrounds should not represent an insurmountable obstacle to the measurement of the eor . in particular assuming an average polarization leakage of 2% ( section  [ sec_imaging ] ) , a stokes @xmath0 leakage fainter than 20  mk would be expected in the @xmath87 region , a factor of two smaller than the value simulated by @xcite .",
    "we have presented a 2400 square degree , stokes @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 survey at 189  mhz carried out with the mwa 32 element prototype .",

    "we exploited a novel approach to wide - field imaging with low - frequency dipole arrays that generates full - polarization images through the co - addition of snapshot images .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the integration of snapshot images is advantageous when correcting for wide - field polarization leakage in dipole arrays .",
    "in our case we achieved an average instrumental polarization better than 1.8% over a @xmath49 field of view ; + 2 .",

    "its rm  @xmath108  rad  m@xmath6 is in agreement with the value measured at 1.4  ghz .",
    "rm variations across the source cause the depolarization observed at low frequencies when integrated over the 32 t psf .",
    "beam depolarization also occurs for fornax  a , for which we did not detect polarized emission at 189  mhz .",
    "no polarized emission is detected for the remaining sources brighter than 4  jy in total intensity .",
    "both beam depolarization and internal faraday dispersion could generate the observed depolarization and higher angular resolution observations will disccriminate between the two cases ; + 3 .",
    "we found a wealth of patchy and filamentary diffuse polarization structures in the galactic foreground over many degrees .",
    "the south galactic pole and an area located at @xmath109 show the brightest polarized features , with peaks up to @xmath513  k  rmsf@xmath3 .",
    "there is a large sky area at @xmath110 where the polarization fluctuations are below 1  k rms .",
    "most of the polarized emission occurs at @xmath111  rad  m@xmath6 .",
    "the limited range of rm values and the comparison with rms of pulsars with known distances indicates that the polarization horizon is within a few hundred parsecs .",
    "our data suggest that polarized emission is the result of vorticity or shear in the local ism @xcite ; + 4 .",
    "the polarized intensities and rotation measure distributions observed across the surveyed area are in agreement with the values simulated by @xcite , indicating that it should be possible to remove polarized foregrounds at the level required to measure the cosmological signal .",
    "a @xmath86 cold patch at @xmath87 looks particularly favourable because of its low polarization and because it contains the only polarized source detected , pmn  j0351 - 2744 , which would represent an ideal polarization calibrator .",
