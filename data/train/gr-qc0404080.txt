    "investigations on how the spacetime structures would be during and after gravitational collapses are important topics in gravitational physics and spacetime physics .",
    "nonlinear nature of gravity is making our understanding of the phenomena very difficult , both conceptually and technically .",
    "steady development of numerical methods is contributing to our deeper understanding on the phenomena .",
    "however , it does not mean the analytical investigations are becoming less meaningful .",
    "on the contrary , the more the numerical results we get , the more variety of analytical investigations is needed to interpret them and to reach the whole understanding of the phenomena .    in this respect , we have not yet obtained enough variety of mathematical models for gravitational collapses which can be studied , mainly by analytical methods . indeed , the cases of just spherical collapses with various matter content is already complicated enough , and investigations are still going on  @xcite . it can be inferred from this situation that constructing and analyzing other types of models may not be an easy task .    as the next step in this direction , cylindrical collapses have been investigated considerably .",
    "this class of collapsing models are important because elongated matter distribution can drastically alter the destination of the gravitational collapse .",
    "already in the newtonian gravity , the jeans scale plays a vital role and the elongated matter longer than its jeans scale tends to split into smaller scale objects . in the case of general relativity",
    ", there is the so - called  hoop conjecture \"  @xcite ; black holes are formed when and only when the matter of mass @xmath3 is contained in a compact region whose circumference @xmath4 in any direction always satisfies @xmath5 .",
    "therefore it is of great importance to study the fate of the collapsing elongated matter , such as cylindrical collapses .",
    "the numerical investigation of the collapse of the non - rotating dust spheroid by shapiro and teukolsky  @xcite suggested that the naked singularities could emerge when sufficiently elongated object collapses .",
    "this numerical result motivated further analytical investigations on the cylindrical collapses . here , in view of the cosmic - censorship hypothesis  @xcite , investigations on more  natural \" conditions , rather than non - rotating cases , are of significance . in particular , the effect of rotation and the effect of matter pressure should be studied .",
    "then , an analytical model of collapsing cylindrical shell made of counter - rotating dust particles was investigated by apostolatos and thorne  @xcite .",
    "( here  counter - rotating particles \" indicates the situation in which the half of the particles are rotating in the opposite direction to the other half of the particles . )",
    "it takes into account the rotation of particles through the rotational pressure , while the net angular - momentum of the shell is kept zero . by avoiding the frame - dragging effect in this manner",
    ", the analysis can be relatively simple .",
    "it turned out that even a small amount of rotation prevents the singularity formation as far as this particular model concerned .",
    "another analytical model of cylindrical gravitational collapses was presented and briefly studied by pereira and wang  @xcite .",
    "this model has interesting features in that not only has it taken into account both the rotation and the pressure effect , but it also tries to take into account the radiation of gravitational waves and massless particles from the collapsing region .",
    "indeed , the numerical work suggests that the gravitational radiation becomes important after the bounce of the cylindrical shell  @xcite . in spite of several interesting features ,",
    "however , this model has not yet been properly investigated so far .",
    "since this model is what is investigated in this paper , let us briefly recall their work  @xcite .",
    "firstly they prepare general formulas in the coordinate system @xmath6 for matching arbitrary two cylindrical spacetimes . here",
    "junction conditions  @xcite play the central role .",
    "then they apply the formulas to look at a particular model . in this model , an interior flat spacetime and an exterior cylindrical spacetime",
    "are matched together at @xmath7 .",
    "the geometry of the exterior spacetime is so chosen that there is out - going flux which can be interpreted as gravitational waves and massless particles ( see sec.[sec:3 ] for the details of this model ) .",
    "then a dynamical equation for the shell is explicitly derived ( see eq.([eq : pw - dynamical1 ] ) in sec.[sec:4 ] ) .",
    "since this non - linear equation is complicated enough , a very special class of solutions is searched for , and three types of special solutions are claimed to be found .",
    "they are the solutions of ( i ) a collapsing shell which bounces back at some finite radius , followed by an eternal expansion afterwards , ( ii ) an eternally expanding shell , and ( iii ) a collapsing shell whose radius reaches zero , resulting in a line - like singularity formation  @xcite .",
    "the solution ( iii ) looks in particular interesting , since it reminds us of the result of numerical calculations by shapiro and teukolsky  @xcite , though the spacetime structures in these two cases are not the same . considering several interesting features of the model , it is quite regrettable that their investigation is a preliminary one in nature with the limitation to the very special class of solutions , and moreover it turns out that the derivation of the special solution faces with crucial problems , which could totally alter the main results ( see sec.[sec:4 ] for the detailed account on this point ) .",
    "thus it is meaningful to analyze this model in detail .    with these situations in mind ,",
    "the present paper aims mainly two goals .",
    "firstly , we set up a general framework for analyzing cylindrical shell collapses in the same spirit as pereira and wang  @xcite , but paying more attention to the mutual relations of three kinds of natural frames of reference .",
    "they are ( 1 ) the ortho - normal frame @xmath8 associated with the cylindrical spacetime geometry , ( 2 ) the ortho - normal frame @xmath9 associated with a shell @xmath10 in question ( here @xmath11 is the normal unit 4-vector to the shell @xmath10 , while @xmath12 is the 4-vector tangent to the world - line of an observer located on the shell ) , and ( 3 ) the coordinate frame @xmath13 .",
    "computations based on the frame ( 1 ) can be carried out systematically , while the frame ( 2 ) is more suitable for interpreting the results .",
    "therefore the bridge between them would be helpful .",
    "the frame ( 3 ) has been also considered since it is often convenient for actual computations .",
    "the second purpose of this paper is to analyze the above - mentioned model , based on the framework we prepare , and investigate the dynamical behavior of the collapsing shell .",
    "we assume that the weak energy condition  @xcite is satisfied outside the shell .",
    "it means , roughly speaking , that the collapsing matter behaves as normal source of gravity .",
    "it shall be proved that , _ the collapsing shell bounces back at some point irrespective of the initial conditions , and escapes from the singularity formation_. the behavior after the bounce depends on the sign of the shell pressure in the z - direction , @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath1 , the shell continues accelerated expansion , and its velocity asymptotically tends to the light velocity . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath14 ( i.e. tension ) , the behavior after the bounce could be more complicated depending on the details of the model . in either case , the shell never reaches the zero - radius configuration , contrary to the result ( the solution ( iii ) mentioned above ) of the preliminary analysis in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .    in sec.[sec:2 ]",
    ", the fundamental formulas on the cylindrical spacetime and the cylindrical shell in it are derived .",
    "we in particular pay attention to the extrinsic curvature of the shell , which plays the central role for studying the shell dynamics .",
    "the junction conditions , which is another essential part for the shell dynamics , are also investigated there .",
    "based on the framework so prepared , then , we investigate in detail a particular model of a collapsing cylinder in sec.[sec:3 ] . in particular , we prove a theorem that the shell never reaches the singularity in this model as far as the weak energy condition is satisfied outside the shell .",
    "section [ sec:4 ] is devoted to the detailed comparison between the present analysis and the one reported in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , pinpointing why the latter had been led to the virtual singular solution .",
    "section [ sec:5 ] is devoted for summary .",
    "we consider a spacetime with cylindrical symmetry defined by a line - element , @xmath15 ( by a suitable coordinate transformation @xmath16 , one can actually assume @xmath17 , but we here keep the form eq.([eq : ds ] ) . )",
    "looking at eq.([eq : ds ] ) , the theory of differential forms is efficiently applied  @xcite , by introducing natural 1-forms , @xmath18 the local ortho - normal frame @xmath19 is then defined as the dual to the 1-forms @xmath20 .",
    "fundamental geometrical quantities , such as curvatures , w.r.t .",

    "we now compute the extrinsic curvature of @xmath10 , which later plays the essential role in analyzing the shell dynamics .",
    "the extrinsic curvature is handled mainly in the _ ortho - normal _ frame @xmath65 in this paper . to remind us of it , we write @xmath66 etc . rather than @xmath67 etc .",
    "there is a standard formula which relates @xmath68 with the christoffel symbol @xmath69 and the normal vector @xmath32 , @xmath70 where in the last line , eq.([eq : gamma - rel ] ) in appendix [ app : b ] has been used to express the christoffel symbol @xmath71 in terms of @xmath72 since the latter , given in eq.([eq : gamma ] ) , is much easier to compute .",

    "in view of its essential significance , the detailed derivation of eq.([eq : kttfinal ] ) is shown in appendix [ app : c ] .",
    "it is by far easier to compute @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "combining eq.([eq : kgeneral ] ) with eqs.([eq : e1 ] ) and ( [ eq : e3 ] ) , we get @xmath78      it is reasonable to compute every quantity in the ortho - normal frame @xmath80 as has been done just above .",
    "however , in order to compare the present results with the results in the preceding work ref.@xcite ( see sec.[sec:4 ] ) , it is also needed to represent main quantities in terms of the coordinate frame @xmath81 .",
    "after some computations ( see appendix [ app : c ] for more details ) , we finally reach the result , @xmath82    here the @xmath83-derivative in the last term on the r.h.s .",
