    "the much - studied gravitationally lensed system , pks1830 - 211 , was identified as such by rao & subrahmanyam ( 1988 ) , and is one of the strongest radio sources in the sky at centimetric wavelengths .",
    "on arcsecond scale , it consists of two prominent radio core - knot structures , lensed images of each other , each core - knot axis being roughly perpendicular to the line of separation of the two cores ( the two cores being separated by about @xmath3 and aligned roughly northeast ( ne ) and southwest ( sw ) in the plane of the sky ) .",
    "the two core - knot groups ( hereafter ne and sw groups ) are point - inversion symmetric with respect to the centre of the system , and show somewhat weaker diffuse emission ( rao & subrahmanyam 1988 , subrahmanyam et al .",
    "1990 ) ; in the radio l - band , the diffuse emission is extended enough that its images actually close round , linking the image groups and making a pseudo - einstein ring system ( jauncey et al .",
    "1991 ) , with nearly half of the total flux density of about @xmath4 jy coming from the cores.the cores themselves have flat radio spectra ( rao & subrahmanyan 1988 ) . on the scale of milliarcseconds in the radio at 43 ghz ,",
    "a weaker , inner knot accompanies each of the bright cores , on the same side of each core as the arcsecond - scale knot ( which is not detected at this resolution ) , and separated from it by @xmath5 mas ( garrett et al 1997 , jones et al .",
    ", guirado et al . 1999 , jin et al . 2003 ) .",
    "jin et al . ( 2003 ) infer that there are time - dependent positional variations in the radio centroids of emission in the bright cores at 43 ghz , resulting in changes in the separation of the two core components on the scale of @xmath6 s to @xmath7 s @xmath8as ( figure  [ linear ] ) between successive observational epochs .",
    "significant radio variability has been reported ( lovell et al . 1996 , van ommen et al .",
    "1995 , hagiwara et al .",
    "1996 and lovell et al .",
    "1998 ) ; in fact , lovell et al.(1998 ) report a time delay between the arrival time at the observer of variations in one core image relative to ( correlated ) variations in the other , of @xmath9 days . however , romero et al.(1997 ) report this system to be non - variable , based on data taken during 1995 - 1996 in the radio l - band .",
    "lovell et al s ( 1998 ) analysis was based on @xmath10 ghz data between 1996 and 1997 , during which period dramatic variations occured .    the source has been identified in egret observations ( mattox et al . , 1997 ) .    in the x - ray ,",
    "rosat obseravtions have revealed absorption against the compact images , in excess of what may be reasonably attributed to our galaxy , implicating a foreground ( lensing ) galaxy ( mathur & nair 1997 ) .",
    "asca observatons ( oshima et al . 2001 ) suggest significant x - ray variability in the system , so that the ratio of the ne image s emission to that of the sw image was a factor of @xmath11 ( as compared with a typical factor of @xmath12 to @xmath13 in the radio ) .",
    "given that the source properties resemble those of a blazar , this is very likely a variation intrinsic to the blazar rather than a lens - induced one , though observations of correlated spectral hardness changes would be necessary to confirm that such a phenomenon indeed occurs in this system .",
    "the system that acts as the gravitational lens , now known to be fairly complex , is believed to be in the main a gas - rich massive spiral galaxy , with a measured redshift of @xmath14 , through molecular absorption line studies ( wiklind & combes 1996 , carilli et al .",
    "1998 , chengalur et al . 1999 ) . in the optical ,",

    "( 2002)(i and v bands ) have presented a wealth of optical and near - ir data , which , suitably image processed , reveal a spiral galaxy lens seen almost face on , with possibly a secondary lens nearby , and perhaps some sign of a lower redshift spiral galaxy about @xmath18 southwards of the system .",
    "lidman et al .",
    "( 1999 ) determine through infrared spectroscopy a redshift for the source @xmath19 .",
    "hi observations ( lovell et al . 1996 ) have earlier revealed some absorption at redshift @xmath20 .",
    "the presence in the optical and ir bands of a foreground low redshift spiral galaxy is highly suggestive of the existence of a secondary lens .",
    "gravitational lens modeling of the system that has attempted to reproduce a range of image properties ( subrahmanyan et al .",
    "1990 , kochanek & narayan 1992 , nair et al .",
    "1993 ) , has shown the system to be consistent with an isolated elliptical lens of mass of the order of that of a spiral galaxy .",
    "however , in view of the apparently complex optical / ir structure subsequently observed along the foreground and upto the lens redshift , a detailed remodeling is in order .    the present work seeks to provide an explanation for the puzzling observations of garrett et al.(1998 ) and jin et al.(2003 ) , wherein it is shown that structural and temporal variations occur in and around the radio core images in this system in vlba observations at 43 ghz .",
    "these observations probe the system at the highest resolution to date , of considerable interest because of the combination of a high redshift source @xmath21 and enhanced resolution due to magnification by lensing . for the purpose of the present study ,",
    "a full reworking of the lens model is actually inessential ; instead , certain lens properties applicable to this system will be either invoked or derived as required .",
    "considering the optical and infrared observations of possible multiple lensing bodies along the line of sight to the system ( as described in the previous section ) , only the most elementary assumptions regarding the lens system will be made . at the location of each image in the plane of the sky",
    ", it is assumed that it is possible to define a @xmath22 source - to - image coordinate transformation matrix that is symmetric .",
    "this is valid provided one or the other of two circumstances occurs:(a )  the dominant lensing agents are roughly at the same distance from the observer , or from the source , so that they can be said to inhabit the same lens plane _",
    "_ blandford & narayan @xmath23 , or ( b )  save for the main deflectors in the same lens plane , lenses at other redshifts provide only a shear perturbation ( however strong or weak ) to the main lens s action .",
    "then the lensing equations reduce to one identical with single - plane lensing , and source - to - image transformation matrices are symmetric as a result ( kovner 1987 ) .",
    "the latter assumption is adopted in view of the possible existence of a lens at @xmath24 , which is seen @xmath25 south , in the plane of the sky , of the lensed images in the system .",
    "in fact , since it has proven fairly successful to model this system with a single elliptical lens ( subrahmanyan et al . 1990 ,",
    "kochanek & narayan 1992 , nair et al .",
    "1993 ) , it is possible that the main lens , a spiral galaxy at @xmath14 which is viewed almost face - on , is aided by shear roughly along the north - south direction by the foreground lens , mimicking the behaviour of a single elliptical lens with such an orientation ( note that this is close to the direction of the major axis of the elliptical lens model in nair et al .",
    "1993 ) . that the effect of the foreground @xmath26 lens can be treated as a perturbation on the main lens action derives some support from the fact that lens models place the effective lens centre between the ne and sw groups of images , and somewhat closer to the negative - parity sw group of images ( the parity of which is demonstrated by the fact that temporal variations in its core s radio flux density lag behind those in the ne core ; @xmath17 lovell et al .",
    "this would be as expected for a single lensing galaxy , suggesting that the actual lens is not very far from one .",
    "figure  [ linear ] ( from fig.3 of jin et al . 2003 ) , plots , for 8 successive epochs of vlba observations at 43 ghz @xmath27 mas fwhm beam ) , changes in declination versus changes in right ascension ( ra ) of the position vector from the centroid of emission of the ne image core to that of the sw image core , all relative to the first epoch ( @xmath28 ) of observation .",
    "formally , the error in estimating these changes is of the order of @xmath29as as both the core images appear in the same field of view in each observation ( jin et al .",
    "the plot is displayed here with straight - line fits to two remarkably linear tracks that can be identified in the plot . in this section , an explanation for this phenomenon",
    "will be sought .",
    "changes in the centroids of radio emission in the ne and sw cores ; their separations as a function of epoch relative to epoch 1 in the figure ( from fig.3 of jin et al .",
    "superposed are straight line fits to the two linear runs apparent in the data , which yield slopes of ( for epochs 2 - 3 - 4 ) @xmath30 and ( for epochs 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 ) , @xmath31 .",
    "anticipating a physical model to be discussed later in this section , it is assumed that the source , a blazar , emits plasmons , one by one , from its central engine , and that the observed ( but essentially unresolved ) core radio emission is dominated for a while by that of the most recently emitted plasmon , which propagates away from the central engine with constant velocity before fading from view ( its spectral evolution , synchrotron self - absorbed , being as described in , for example , van der laan 1966 ) .",
    "any changes in the location of the radio emission of the central engine itself are assumed to be undetectable as a function of time @xmath32as ) .",
    "( the actual position of the central engine then drops out of the following computations , because we consider changes in position relative to a reference epoch ) .",
    "the radio core of the source and its associated features are lensed into two images , denoted by the subscripts @xmath33 ( the ne group ) and @xmath34 ( the sw group ) in what follows .",
    "changes occuring in the unlensed source shall be referred to as being in the _ source plane _ , and the corresponding effects in the images shall be referred to as occuring in the _ image plane_. for the unlensed source , let the angular distance of an ejected plasmon from the central engine at any given epoch of observation , @xmath35 , be denoted by @xmath36 $ ] , its components along the directions of increasing ra and declination being represented by @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively .",
    "now , local to a point in a gravitationally lensed image , positional changes are mapped through a linear transformation of the underlying changes in the source .",
    "that is , for small changes @xmath39 in the source , the corresponding changes in images a and b are given by :    @xmath40    @xmath41    two comments are in order at this point:@xmath42 ( a )  it has been assumed that the source - to - image transformation matrices are symmetric , under the circumstances discussed in section  [ lensmod ] and ( b )  , when considering observed changes in the images , it is necessary to account for the fact that events in the sw image are behind those in the ne image , by an amount equal to the time delay between the images , @xmath43 days ( lovell et al . 1998 ) .",
    "thus the observed changes in the two images map back to two different epochs in the source itself ( epochs referring to events in the source will hereinafter be called _ source epochs _ , as distinct from _ observer epochs _ ) .",
    "formally , it is possible to define a relative or image - to - image transformation matrix ( in this case , the sw image - to - ne image , or ` sw2ne ' , matrix will be defined ) :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "when evaluating this matrix from the observations , which here include evolving components , care must be taken that appropriate corrections are introduced for the differing source epochs ( or alternatively , light arrival time delays ) corresponding to each of the images .    adopting the hjellming & johnston ( 1981 ) model for ss433 ( or the gower et al .",
    "1982 model , as applied to agns ) for a precessing helical jet , we assume that a plasmon in the jet is ejected from the central engine of the source with constant velocity @xmath50 along the surface of a cone of half - opening angle @xmath51 , the symmetry axis of which is the axis of the jet ( @xmath17 fig.[js ] ) .",
    "new plasmons are ejected ballistically from time to time .",
    "the plasmon ejection velocity vector precesses with angular velocity @xmath52 about the cone s surface , making a constant angle @xmath51 with the jet axis , so that each subsequent plasmon is ejected at a different phase of the jet s precession .",
    "once ejected with a given velocity @xmath50 , a plasmon continues to propagate away from the central engine with that velocity ( or it fades from view before it appears to decelerate or accelerate ) .",
    "each plasmon is assumed to consist of an isotropically expanding cloud of synchrotron - emitting electrons , so that the centroid of emission is not affected by its evolution .",
    "as mentioned earlier , it is assumed that only one plasmon at a time dominates the unresolved radio emission from the radio core .",
    "it is also assumed that the line of sight of the observer coincides with the jet precession axis , for simplicity of calculations .    underlying model for the precessing jet .",
    "the jet emission vector makes an angle @xmath51 ( jet half - opening angle ) with its axis , which is also the line of sight by assumption _ ( left)_. from time to time , plasmons are ejected , and each propagates with constant velocity along the surface of the cone defined by the motion of the emission vector . _ ( right ) : _ the view along the line of sight to the blazar , prior to lensing .",

    "the presence of a second evolving plasmon plasmon coexisting with the first would considerably complicate this simple picture !",

    "the appearance of a new plasmon in the ne image precedes that in the sw image by 26 days , or nearly two successive epochs in our 43 ghz observations , so if the discontinuity were to be caused by its appearance in the ne image , there should be another such discontinuity two epochs later , caused by its manifestation in the sw image .",
    "the fact that both linear tracks are more than two epochs long suggests that this is not the case .",
    "the reason is somewhat subtle and will be discussed in section  [ justne ] after deriving some quantities in connection with the source - to - image transformation matrices , but for the moment we identify the discontinuities in these linear tracks as corresponding to the appearance of new plasmons in the _ sw _ image ( so that , by the time a discontinuity occurs , the _ same _ source plasmon is imaged in both the ne and the sw regions ) .",
    "as an aside , notice that for equal intervals between epochs , the changes @xmath82 should be the same , along a single linear track . that this is only approximately true for each of the two tracks in figure  [ linear ] is an indication that emission near the central core is variable at some level , pulling in or pushing out the centroid of radio emission from time to time",
    "this results in an apparent change in speed of the emergent plasmon , with no significant change in direction .    for later use",

    "the rate of precession is evaluated as that which would have been observed in the absence of the lens , rather than that intrinsic to the source , since the component of the bulk velocity of the jet along the line of sight can not be determined ( but is expected to be close to the velocity of light ) .",
    "it is calculated as described in sections  [ microjet ] and [ dirmilli ] , over a range of values @xmath186 .",
    "recalling that the actual phases of ejection are only determined modulo @xmath91 , there is a degeneracy in determining the difference of phases @xmath187 for both the milliarcsecond and the microarcsecond analyses .",
    "this means that each separation @xmath188 actually corresponds to four possible branches .",

    "the observed period must be corrected for the cosmological time dilation on account of the source being at a redshift of 2.5 , and for the change in time interval on account of the jet velocity in the source .",

    "the error in evaluating the precession period is estimated via a monte carlo exercise that generates , for each of 60,000 experiments , a random selection of all the observational errors , taking into account the cross - correlations between elements of the sw2ne image - to - image transformation matrix , and then computes the desired precession rate for a value of @xmath186 of 0.3 . for the microarcsecond scale analysis ,",

    "moreover , it is lensed , so there remains the possibility of spectral changes due to different scales of the source being magnified to different extents on account of microlensing by stars in the lens galaxy .",
    "however , a method such as measuring the timescale of variability of gamma ray emission from the source can be used .",
    "although two timetracks , one time - delayed with respect to the other by 26 days , would be observed together , the timescale of variability is expected to be typically of the order of a day or less ( liang & liu 2003 ) , making it unnecessary to correct for the time delayed track .",
