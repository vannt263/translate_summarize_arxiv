    "the study of dynamical critical phenomena associated with the pinning - depinning transition in random media has become a subject of considerable interest in recent years .",
    "this is due to the importance of pinning in a wide variety of technologically important phenomena such as flux line ( fl ) motion in type - ii superconductors , dynamics of interfaces ( phase boundaries , invasion fronts , cracks , surface growth , to name a few ) , and charge - density wave ( cdw ) transport .",
    "these systems are characterized by a rough energy landscape due to the randomness in the medium . at zero temperature",
    "there are two distinct  phases \" , distinguished by an order parameter ( henceforth called velocity ) that measures the dynamic response , such as the average velocity for a fl , or current for a cdw . for small driving forces ,",
    "the system is trapped by one of the many available metastable stationary states , and is  pinned \" to the impurities in the medium .",
    "critical behavior emerges as the stationary states disappear , and the system starts moving with a nonzero velocity , when the driving force is increased above a threshold value .",
    "extensive experimental @xcite , theoretical@xcite , and simulation@xcite work has been done to understand the properties of this transition in cdw systems .",
    "there are also numerous studies on the depinning of driven interfaces@xcite .",
    "a better theoretical understanding of this dynamical phase transition was recently achieved , and critical exponents were calculated through an @xmath3-expansion for both cdw systems@xcite and driven interfaces@xcite .",
    "more recently , we performed similar calculations for the depinning of an elastic line in a bulk random medium , like a polymer in a gel network , a fl in a type - ii superconductor , or a screw dislocation in a crystal@xcite . in this article",
    ", we present a detailed report of our study on the dynamical critical behavior associated with the depinning of a fl , and in general on the depinning of directed manifolds in random media , through methods similar to those used for cdws and interfaces .",
    "specifically , let us consider the geometry of the fl shown in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] .",
    "the superconductor is subject to a magnetic field @xmath8 along the @xmath9-axis , and a bulk supercurrent @xmath10 along the @xmath11-axis .",
    "a fl is oriented along @xmath12 on the average , but deviates from a straight line due to impurities in the superconductor , which are represented by a potential @xmath13 .",
    "the conformations of the fl are described by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a _ two component _ vector , lying in a plane normal to the magnetic field .",
    "the bulk current @xmath0 drives the fl along the @xmath16-direction through the lorentz force @xmath17 .",
    "( @xmath18 is the flux quantum . )",
    "if the bulk current is large enough , the fl drifts with an average velocity @xmath19 . due to the chiral nature of the supercurrents around the fl ,",
    "@xmath19 is in general not along the @xmath16-direction , but makes an angle @xmath20 with the @xmath16-axis .",
    "this is usually called the _ hall angle _ , and although typically small@xcite , it can be significant near the depinning transition .",
    "it is more convenient to work with components of @xmath21 that are parallel and perpendicular to @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath22    = 2.9truein    * ( a ) *    = 2.9truein    * ( b ) *    where the unit vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 are rotated by @xmath20 from the @xmath16- and @xmath11-axes respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ geometry]b . in sec.[eom ] we show that , under very general assumptions , the equation of motion for small deviations around a straight line , generalized to @xmath25-dimesional internal coordinates @xmath26 , can be written as    [ motion ] @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the viscosity the fl and @xmath29 .",
    "the moduli @xmath30 relate the elastic force to the local curvature and are in general nondiagonal for a sample with orientation - dependent core energy , or nonzero hall angle ( cf .",
    "[ eom ] ) .",
    "the random forces @xmath31 that arise from the impurity potential @xmath32 are taken to have zero mean with correlations @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a function that decays rapidly for large values of its argument .",
    "( the indices @xmath35 . )    ignoring fluctuations of the fl transverse to the direction of average velocity , i.e. setting @xmath36 , leads to an interface depinning model studied by nattermann , stepanow , tang , and leschhorn ( nstl)@xcite , and by narayan and fisher ( nf)@xcite . hence , the major difference between eqs.([motion ] ) ( henceforth called the  vector depinning model \" ) and the previously studied  interface model \" is the existence of transverse fluctuations , making the position of the line @xmath21 a vector instead of a scalar  height \" variable .",
    "the effects of such transverse fluctuations for large driving forces and average velocities , when the randomness in the medium can be approximated as uncorrelated in space and time , were shown@xcite to create a much richer dynamical phase diagram than the corresponding interface growth model , namely the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation@xcite .",
    "then , the natural questions to ask are : how do these transverse fluctuations scale near the depinning threshold , and how do they influence the critical dynamics of longitudinal fluctuations ?    in order to make these questions more quantifiable , we consider the exponents that characterize the critical behavior near the depinning transition .",
    "let @xmath37 denote the driving force required to move the fl with a velocity @xmath38 . for small values of @xmath39 ,",
    "the line is pinned by the disorder in the medium .",
    "there is a threshold force @xmath40 , such that the line moves with a nonzero average velocity @xmath41 iff @xmath42@xcite . for @xmath43 slightly above threshold , we expect the average velocity to scale as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the velocity exponent and @xmath46 is a nonuniversal constant .",
    "superposed on the steady advance of the line are rapid  jumps \" as portions of the line depin from strong pinning centers .",
    "such jumps are similar to avalanches in other slowly forced systems and have a power - law distribution in size , cut off at a characteristic correlation length @xmath47 . on approaching the threshold",

    "the scaling functions @xmath53 go to a constant as their arguments approach 0 ; @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the longitudinal and transverse wandering exponents of an instantaneus line profile ; @xmath56 and @xmath57 characterize scaling of relaxation times of longitudinal and transverse modes with wave vector through @xmath58 . beyond the length scale @xmath47 ,",
    "regions move more or less independently of each other and the system is no longer critical . the behavior of the moving line is described by the exponents calculated earlier@xcite for time dependent noise .",
    "ignoring any potential nonlinearities leads to a regular diffusion equation with white noise , for which the roughness and dynamic exponents are @xmath59 . in the interface model , transverse fluctuations",
    "do not exist , thus , @xmath55 and @xmath57 are not defined .",
    "equations ( [ motion ] ) can be analyzed using the formalism of martin , siggia , and rose ( msr)@xcite . a renormalization group ( rg ) treatment of the  interface model \" , studied by nstl@xcite and nf@xcite , indicates an upper critical dimension of @xmath60 , and exponents in @xmath1 dimensions , given to one - loop order as @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "nstl obtained this result by directly averaging the msr generating functional @xmath63 , and calculating the renormalization of the force - force correlation function @xmath64 .",
    "nf , on the other hand , expanded @xmath63 around a saddle point solution corresponding to a mean - field approximation@xcite to eqs.([motion ] ) which involves _ temporal _ force - force correlations @xmath65 .",
    "they point out some of the deficiencies of conventional low - frequency analysis , and suggest that the roughness exponent is equal to @xmath66 to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "they also show that for two different classes of disordered systems , random - field and random - bond disorder , the zero temperature interface dynamics is essentially the same near threshold .",
    "their argument remains valid for vector depinning , and our results will be applicable to both types of randomness . as we shall demonstrate in section  [ model ] , the longitudinal exponents of the  vector \" model are identical to those of the depinning interface , and given by @xmath67 other exponents are determined by exact exponent identities from @xmath54 and @xmath56 as @xmath68    following the formalism of nf , we employ a perturbative expansion of the disorder - averaged msr partition function around a mean - field solution for scalloped impurity potentials@xcite .",
    "we show that slightly above threshold , transverse fluctuations do not significantly affect the dynamics of longitudinal fluctuations , apart from shifting the threshold force @xmath40 . specifically , the exponents and exponent identities given in eqs .",
    "( [ exp1][exp4 ] ) for @xmath69 are also correct for the vector depinning model . however , transverse fluctuations turn out to scale differently , with @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in particular , in an _ isotropic _ medium with hall angle @xmath72 ( model a in section  [ eom ] ) , the renormalization of transverse temporal force - force correlations @xmath73 yields @xmath74 correct to all orders in @xmath3 .",
    "the transverse dynamic exponent is given by an _",
    "exact _ exponent identity : @xmath75 these conclusions can also be generalized to more than one transverse direction : the results do not depend on the number of transverse coordinates . for the fl @xmath76 , the critical exponents are then predicted to be @xmath77 this implies that in a type ii superconductor driven slightly above threshold , flux lines are contained mostly in the plane normal to the current , up to the correlation length scale @xmath47 .",
    "this may have a noticeable effect on the dynamics of entanglement of flux lines near depinning .",
    "these results also rationalize the use of a  planar approximation \" in numerical simulations of fl depinning@xcite .",
    "another important consideration is the role of anisotropy in the bulk material .",
    "it was recently shown that anisotropy leads to new universality classes in interface depinning@xcite .",
    "we show that this happens as well for fl depinning , in an even richer fashion .",
    "the presence of a nonzero hall angle affects the critical behavior in a manner similar to anisotropy .",
    "these issues are discussed in more detail in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ eom ] , we derive the general form of the equation of motion for a single fl , starting from a reparametrization invariant ( ri ) descpription of the fl dynamics . in section  [ model ] , we first establish the connection of eqs .",
    "( [ motion ] ) to the interface depinning problem for the simple case of an isotropic medium with zero hall angle .",
    "we then examine the linear response of the system to derive the exponent identities ( [ exp3]),([exp4 ] ) , and ( [ exp6 ] ) , which are later shown to be consistent with a formal rg treatment of the problem in more general circumstances . in section  [ formalism ] , we present the msr formalism and expand the generating functional around a self - consistent saddle point solution , given by a mean - field theory . in section  [ mft ] , we calculate response and connected correlation functions of the mean - field theory , which correspond to the bare propagators and vertex functions in a perturbative expansion . in section",
    "[ scaling ] , we determine critical exponents through an @xmath3-expansion near @xmath78 dimensions , and in sec .  [",
    "numerical ] we compare these with numerical results obtained by directly integrating the equations of motion . finally , in section  [ conclusion ] we discuss the physical significance of these results , the roles of nonlinear terms and anisotropy , and applicability of similar methods to related problems .",
    "in this section we derive a phenomenological equation that describes the coarse - grained ( in space and time ) evolution of a single fl in a bulk type - ii superconductor .",
    "the configuration of the fl at time @xmath79 is described by @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is an arbitrary parameter which we shall later equate to the @xmath82component of @xmath83 .",
    "the equations of motion are obtained by balancing the  conservative \" and  dynamical \" forces .",
    "conservative forces are derived from the energy functional and depend only on the instantaneous configuration @xmath84 of the fl .",
    "they include the elastic force , random forces due to the impurity potential @xmath32 , and the lorentz force due to the bulk current .",
    "dynamical forces , on the other hand , depend explicitly on the local velocity of the fl and comprise the dissipative and magnus forces@xcite .    for notational simplicity , we set the external magnetic field @xmath12 along the @xmath9-axis and the the average velocity @xmath85 along @xmath23 , suppressing the possible dependence of parameters on the relative orientation of @xmath12 and @xmath23 due to anisotropy in the underlying material .",
    "such complications will be taken up later in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "an important consideration is the requirement that the equation of motion be invariant under an arbitrary reparametrization @xmath86 of the curve .",
    "one such reparametrization invariant quantity is the infinitesimal arclength @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the metric .",
    "the only physically observable motions of the fl are orthogonal to the local unit tangent vector @xmath89 assuming that the fl motion is overdamped , the conservative force @xmath90 , which is derived below , is balanced by dynamical forces that are proportional to the local normal velocity @xmath91 .",
    "( here , @xmath92 projects any vector onto the local normal plane . )",
    "dynamical forces are not necessarily parallel to @xmath93 : in general , there is an angle @xmath20 ( called the hall angle ) between the applied force and the velocity of the fl .",
    "physically , this is due to the magnus force which is orthogonal to the velocity , and the hall effect in the normal core of the fl@xcite .",
    "the equation of motion can then be written as @xmath94    to determine the conservative force @xmath90 , consider the energy cost associated with a particular coarse - grained configuration @xmath95 of the fl in the absence of a bulk current , which is @xmath96=\\int ds\\sqrt{g } \\left\\{\\frac{\\partial_s{\\vec r}\\cdot{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\sigma$ } } \\cdot\\partial_s{\\vec r}}{g } + v({\\vec r}(s))\\right\\}.\\ ] ] in the above equation , the symmetric tensor @xmath97 gives the core energy per unit length of the fl , and can be nondiagonal for an anisotropic sample .",
    "( anharmonic contributions to the core energy can be ignored in a coarse - grained description and we will systematically keep only the leading order elastic terms . )",
    "the restoring force @xmath98 is given by the energy cost of an infinitesimal virtual displacement @xmath99 .",
    "after some rearrangement , we arrive at @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the local curvature vector . to leading order , the random potential @xmath102 that multiplies @xmath103 can be approximated by its spatial average , and eliminated without loss of generality by choosing @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath105 acts as a random force on each segment of the fl , whose correlations in general satisfy @xmath106 for now , we do not restrict the form of @xmath107 , apart from the reasonable expectation that it decays quickly beyond a characteristic impurity size @xmath108 . when a bulk current @xmath109 is present , the fl is also subject to a lorentz force @xmath110 , where @xmath18 is the flux quantum .",
    "thus , the total conservative force acting on a section of the fl is given as @xmath111 for an isotropic sample in the extreme type - ii limit , the bardeen - stephen model gives@xcite @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the london penetration depth , @xmath114 is the coherence length , and @xmath115 are normal and hall resistivities of the non - superconducting core region , respectively .",
    "more general expressions for these phenomenological parameters can be derived from a mesoscopic model based on a time - dependent ginzburg - landau theory@xcite .",
    "equation ( [ fullmotion ] ) is highly nonlinear and generalizes those of ref.@xcite to the three - dimensional and anisotropic case .",

    "in this section , we study some properties of the system described by eqs.([eqb ] ) and ( [ eqa ] ) , in detail . due to statistical translational symmetry in time",
    "@xmath79 and internal coordinates @xmath136 , we use the real @xmath139 and fourier @xmath140 domains interchangeably when dealing with statistical averages .",
    "the vector depinning model differs from the cdw or interface problems due to the presence of transverse fluctuations @xmath141 .",
    "it is sometimes useful to recast the equations such that @xmath123 appears as a function of @xmath122 rather than @xmath79 .",
    "the asymmetry in @xmath122 and @xmath123 occurs because @xmath122 almost always moves in the forward direction@xcite , and therefore is a monotonous function of @xmath79 .",
    "thus , for any particular realization of the random force @xmath142 , there is a unique point @xmath143 that is visited by the line for given coordinates @xmath144 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath145 can be obtained schematically , by dividing eq.([eqb]b ) by ( [ eqb]a ) , as @xmath146 we shall see that in most cases , the scaling properties of @xmath123 in relation to @xmath122 can be obtained heuristically by inspecting eq.([astar ] ) .      first of all , we establish the connection between eq.([eqa ] ) and the interface depinning model for the special case of an isotropic system with @xmath72 ( model a ) . for a particular realization of randomness @xmath147 , eq.([eqa]a ) can be written as @xmath148 where @xmath149 and @xmath145 is determined by eq.([astar ] ) .",
    "it is quite plausible that , after averaging over all @xmath150 , the correlations in @xmath151 will also be short - ranged , albeit different from those of @xmath150 , since the dissipative dynamics will avoid maxima of the random potential , effectively reducing the average forces . in that case , the equation reduces exactly to the model studied by nstl and nf .",
    "thus , the scaling of longitudinal fluctuations of the fl near threshold will not change upon taking into account transverse components , and the exponent relations ( [ exp1][exp4 ] ) hold for model a as well .",
    "we expect this argument to hold even for model b [ eqs.([eqb ] ) ] as long as @xmath152 , or when @xmath153 .    for the interface model , it is possible to show that @xmath154 is a single valued function using the  no passing rule \" of middleton@xcite .",
    "the rule states that no interface ( or cdw ) can overtake another , if initially every point on the first interface is behind the second one .",
    "this rule does not apply to the vector model : it is in principle possible to have coexistence of moving and stationery fls , allowing for the possibility of a discontinuous ( multi - valued ) @xmath155 .",
    "however , since a moving line samples an arbitrarily large region in the medium , it is plausible that the velocity self - averages at long times , resulting in a single valued @xmath155 ( i.e. , no hysteresis ) .",
    "however , finite - size systems do suffer from such hysteresis which adversely affects numerical simulations of the model .",
    "these issues are further discussed in sec.[numerical ] .",
    "several exponent identities can be deduced from the form of the linear response , @xmath156 in the @xmath157 limit . due to the statistical symmetry of eqs.([eqa ] ) under the transformation @xmath158 , the linear response is diagonal .",
    "let us first set @xmath159 and examine the static response : an additional static force @xmath160 with zero spatial average ( no @xmath161 component ) can be exactly compensated by the coordinate change @xmath162 the distribution of @xmath150 does not change in the primed coordinates .",
    "thus , the static linear response has the form @xmath163 since @xmath164 scales like the applied force , the form of the linear response at the correlation length @xmath47 gives the exponent identity @xmath165 considering the transverse linear response seems to imply @xmath166 .",
    "however , as will be shown below , the static part of the transverse linear response becomes irrelevant at the critical rg fixed point , since @xmath167 .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that the dynamics is responsible for the distinction between longitudinal and transverse modes .",
    "why are the relaxational dynamics different in the two fluctuation directions near depinning ?",
    "the answer can be traced to a simple symmetry argument , which requires @xmath168 and @xmath19 to remain parallel , i.e. @xmath169 where @xmath170 , and @xmath43 is some ( scalar ) function which depends on only the magnitude @xmath41 , of velocity . for small deviations around @xmath38 ,",
    "we thus obtain ( see fig .  [ dfdv ] ) @xmath171    = 2.9truein    these two derivatives clearly scale differently in the @xmath172 limit , which causes a separation of relaxation time scales , as shown below .",
    "now consider the response to a spatially uniform ( @xmath173 ) , but time - dependent , external force @xmath174 . the leading term in the dynamic response is intricately connected to @xmath155 : when a slowly varying uniform external force @xmath174 is applied",
    ", the fl responds as if the instantaneous external force @xmath175 is a constant , i.e. it moves with the average velocity @xmath176 therefore , near the depinning transition , @xmath177    eq.([staticresp ] ) can be combined with the above to yield a taylor expansion of the inverse linear response around @xmath178 that reads @xmath179 the zero of @xmath180 in the complex @xmath181plane for a given value of the wavevector @xmath182 gives the relaxation time of the corresponding mode .",
    "thus , the relaxation times of fluctuations with wavelength @xmath47 are @xmath183 which in turn yield @xmath184 thus , @xmath167 as noted earlier . this difference arises entirely from the different scaling properties of @xmath185 @xmath186 $ ] and @xmath187 @xmath188 $ ] near the depinning transition , as noted earlier",
    "a similar linear response analysis can be made for the more general case of model b. the leading contributions to the static and dynamic part of the inverse linear response are given by @xmath189 the relation between the external force and the drift velocity can in general be written as @xmath190.\\ ] ] both @xmath43 and @xmath20 in general depend on the orientation of @xmath191 , parametrized by an angle @xmath192 in the @xmath193-plane .",
    "then , for small deviations around @xmath38 , @xmath194 where @xmath195 the scaling of diagonal elements in the linear response are the same as in model a. therefore , exponent identities ( [ aexp2]-[aexp3 ] ) hold in the more general case of model b as well .",
    "we use the formalism of msr@xcite to compute response and correlation functions for the dynamical system described by eqs .",
