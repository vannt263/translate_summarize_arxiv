    "the transport behavior of one - dimensional systems has intensively been investigated both in classical and in quantum mechanical context for several decades now . in the classical domain it seems to be largely accepted that normal energy transport , i.e. , spatial diffusion instead of ballistic transport or localization requires the chaotic dynamics of a non - integrable system @xcite . in the non - classical regime",
    "the question whether normal transport behavior may arise from the underlying quantum mechanical equations of motion is a controversial issue @xcite .",
    "this is mostly due to the nontrivial character of the question , how energy or heat is transported through a system on a microscopic level of description .    among the most prominent techniques of theoretical description",
    "is the use of the green - kubo formula @xcite that is derived on the basis of linear response theory . here ,",
    "similar to the classical case , strong evidence arises that integrability leads to diverging transport coefficients and that thus normal transport is not to be expected @xcite .",
    "an overview of theoretical approaches along with their respective subtleties , pitfalls and shortcomings was recently given in @xcite .",
    "the article at hand addresses the problem within the framework of the theory of open quantum systems @xcite by coupling the system of interest explicitly to environments of different temperature . in recent years",
    "many investigations on heat transport have been carried out in this framework @xcite . according to the results of these studies numerical evidence for normal transport behavior arises , even in the integrable system . however , the investigations are generally limited to small system sizes as the computation is highly demanding .    to investigate a real bulk property of the material , e.g. , the heat conductivity , one primary aim is to apply methods that can cope with larger systems in order to rule out that the mentioned findings are merely due to finite size effects .",
    "the present article constitutes one step towards this aim .",
    "the common setup in models of open quantum systems comprises the system of interest and an environment . employing various approximation schemes for the system - environment coupling",
    "one derives effective dissipative equations of motion for the reduced density matrix @xmath1 of the open system .",
    "these equations are called markovian quantum master equations ( qme ) . here",
    ", the term markovian refers to the special time - local structure that arises when all memory effects are negligible .",
    "the qme is usually required to be in lindblad form in order to guarantee the preservation of the normalization and of the positivity of the reduced density matrix , as well as the complete positivity of the resulting dynamical map @xcite .    once equipped with a qme of lindblad structure the way is paved for efficient numerical studies of larger systems by means of the stochastic simulation techniques provided by the monte carlo wave function method ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in contrast to the common open system setup described above , where the environment serves as a heat bath driving the system into thermal equilibrium , the introduction of a second heat bath of different temperature leads to dynamics that may feature a nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "such states typically feature both energy currents as well as temperature gradients .",
    "unfortunately , in the present case the derivation of a qme in lindblad form , that reasonably describes the expected physical behavior turns out to be other than straightforward . lacking any qme in lindblad form also the mentioned efficient stochastic simulation technique is no longer applicable . as an example let us study energy transport in one - dimensional heisenberg spin-@xmath0 chains that are coupled locally to heat baths of different temperature . in order to illuminate the problem that arises in the attempt to apply the standard recipe to transport dynamics we shall focus on one of the aforementioned approximations that are invoked in the derivation of a qme which actually does feature lindblad form .",
    "the most common approximation which yields a lindblad form ( in the weak - coupling limit ) is the so - called secular approximation ( sa ) @xcite . essentially , this approximation consists in replacing the generator of the interaction picture master equation by its time average .",
    "the sa is justified as long as the time scale set by the differences of the bohr frequencies of the open system is short compared to the relaxation time . in many cases",
    "it is equivalent to the rotating wave approximation , but there exist counterexamples @xcite .",
    "we observe that , once the sa has been performed , one is left with a qme that predicts a vanishing energy current in the presence of a finite temperature gradient .",
    "the standard weak - coupling lindblad master equation that is obtained on the basis of the sa is therefore inappropriate to describe heat transport .",
    "hence , in order to be able to apply the standard monte carlo wave function techniques to heat transport one needs an appropriate quantum master equation which leads to a finite stationary energy current and , at the same time , is of lindblad form . here",
    ", we derive such a master equation which is valid in the regime of weak internal couplings .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ background ]",
    "we introduce the details of our model and give the definition of the energy current operator .",
    "moreover , we briefly recall the derivation of the redfield master equation for the density matrix of the spin chain .",
    "section [ sec : level4 ] contains a discussion of the sa and of its influence in the description of heat transport .",
    "we further derive a completely positive markovian master equation for the dynamics of the spin chain and demonstrate that it yields an excellent approximation of the dynamics given by the redfield equation .",
