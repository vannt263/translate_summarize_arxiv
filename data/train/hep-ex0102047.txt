    "measurements of fragmentation processes imply that quarks are subjected to large energy losses from strong interactions before they form hadrons . the production of heavy quark  antiquark pairs at electron ",
    "positron colliders provides a suitable environment in which to analyse these strong interactions , namely , the initial state is colour neutral , and the initial kinematics is known from the beam energy .",
    "the final state momenta of the quarks are carried away by the measured d and b mesons , except for corrections due to the second quark which is required for hadron formation and higher meson resonances .",
    "the perspective followed in this analysis is that the primary quark loses energy during the time it remains in the strong field originating from the primary quark and anti - quark travelling away from each other .",
    "the questions addressed are : how long did the quark remain in the field  ? are there variations in the field strength  ? what is the influence of the quark mass  ?",
    "the answers will be used to predict fragmentation functions for particles which contain the primary quark and which have not decayed .",
    "instead of the fractional energy @xmath1 , commonly used in the studies of fragmentation data , the rapidity change @xmath2 in the direction of motion is used in this analysis .",
    "we take advantage of the fact that @xmath3 is the same in the laboratory and in the rest frame of the quark . the initial rapidity @xmath4 of the quark with mass @xmath5 is given by the @xmath6 center of mass energy @xmath7 via @xmath8 .",
    "the quark final state rapidity is @xmath9 and corresponds to that of the primary hadron . throughout this analysis @xmath10",
    "will be used where @xmath3 is , for the data considered in this analysis , a good approximation to the quark rapidity change as defined above .    in fig .",

    ", the measurements can be described by exponentially falling dependences . in the case of the b meson measurement ( full circles ) ,",
    "two exponential components are visible in the data of which the first is likely to reflect primary b mesons , since the b@xmath0 meson data ( star symbols ) show a similar dependence .",

    "although the errors of the data at the lower beam energy are large , they have the tendency to be above the measurements at the z resonance .",
    "the observation of a scaling behaviour in the spectra of the rapidity change is of interest and is suggestive of a common hadronization mechanism .",
    "the distribution of the proper time @xmath22 , measured in the rest frame of the quark , is related to the rapidity distribution by @xmath23 the differential @xmath24 is related to the acceleration of the quark . in the case of constant acceleration , the rapidity distribution gives a direct measure of the proper time distribution .",

    "this then implies that the probability for the appropriately coloured and flavoured light anti - quark appearing and joining with the heavy quark to form the hadron is constant with respect to the clock of the travelling heavy quark .",
    "a similar interpretation of @xmath3 spectra has been suggested for @xmath28 @xcite and @xmath29 @xcite data .    in what follows ,",
    "we take the view that the mechanism behind fragmentation is probabilistic in nature and can be described by ( [ eq : tau ] ) with a universal formation time @xmath30 which is independent of the strength of the force and the quark flavour .",
    "one implication of a probabilistic fragmentation mechanism with a universal formation time @xmath30 is the direct relation of the rapidity change spectra to the masses which are accelerated . from integration of ( [ eq : con ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath31 the different exponential slopes @xmath16 , determined from the fits shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dy ] , are then related to the different effective masses accelerated in the field . the energy scale is given by @xmath32 which is expected to be of the order of @xmath33 gev .    in fig .",

    "the effective mass values of the d@xmath0 data are found to be consistently below the b data and indicate a dependence of the charm mass on the beam energy scale .    in this way ,",
    "the observed scaling in the spectra of the rapidity change ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dy ] ) can naturally be explained by different quark masses being decelerated in the strong field .",
    "a second implication of a probabilistic fragmentation mechanism with a universal formation time @xmath30 is that variations in the strength of the force acting on the quarks can be determined as a function of the proper time .",
