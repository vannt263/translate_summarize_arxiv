    "throughout this paper we shall adopt the following notation and conventions : @xmath0 is a given natural number and @xmath1 is a possible divisor of @xmath0 . if @xmath1 actually divides @xmath0 then @xmath2 . let @xmath3 denotes any real analytic function defined in the neighborhood of the origin by a power series@xmath4 with all @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "it will be shown that @xmath7 is also the exponent of @xmath8 in the expansion ( [ f0 ] ) around zero and @xmath7 labels half - lines or rays of divisors ( see below ) .",
    "the theory of divisors of integers is the cornerstone of elementary number theory .",
    "it is convenient to introduce _ the characteristic function for divisors _ :    * definition . * for any @xmath9@xmath10    another pretty obvious ( and rather useless in numerical calculations ) representation of ( [ alpha1 ] ) is:@xmath11 where @xmath12  denotes the euler gamma function and @xmath13 gives the remainder on division of @xmath0 by @xmath1 .",
    "in fact ( [ alpha2 ] ) is more general than ( [ alpha1 ] )  since it may be calculated also for non - integer or even complex values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 but this leads to some interpretation difficulties which we shall not discuss here .    consider the following expression for some natural numbers @xmath0 and @xmath1:@xmath14 we will prove the following    * theorem . *",
    "apart from a trivial normalization factor , @xmath15  defined in formula  ( [ alpha1 ] ) is equal to @xmath16 defined in  ( [ alpha3 ] ) .",
    "* expanding the exponential function in ( [ alpha3 ] )  in power series and performing term - by - term differentiation we get:@xmath17 recall the general formulas for the @xmath0-th  derivative of @xmath18 with respect to @xmath8@xmath19@xmath20 where the second formula stems from properties of the gamma function and is suitable for integer negative @xmath21 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "note that the order of derivative @xmath0 does not have to be integer but for integer @xmath0  both ( [ power derivative 1 ] ) and ( [ power derivative 2 ] ) reduce to the well - known elementary differentiation rule . using ( [ power derivative 1 ] ) we get:@xmath22 by simple inspection of ( [ alpha5 ] ) we see why this expression `` feels '' the divisors of the integer @xmath0 . indeed , when taking the limit @xmath23 the only non - zero term in the series appears when @xmath24 for some integer @xmath7 , and this occurs if and only if @xmath1 divides @xmath0 .",
    "all terms with @xmath25 disappear in the limit @xmath23 whereas those with @xmath26 , although singular in @xmath27 , vanish since the binomial coefficient term is zero . therefore , in the summation ( [ alpha5 ] ) at most only one term can survive in the limit process.@xmath28    the above reasoning might appear far too excessive .",
    "however , it guarantees that among divisors none have been omitted .",
    "it should also be stressed that it may be used as a starting point for various generalizations since @xmath0 need not to be integer .",
    "it is easy to guess the normalizing factor:@xmath29 using the same reasoning we can derive similar expression for @xmath16:@xmath30",
    "in a natural way coefficients @xmath16  may be regarded as a square matrix of arbitrarily large dimension where the running integer @xmath0 labels rows and the potential divisor @xmath1 labels columns .",

    "this matrix is always triangular , since of course no divisor can exceed a given number , and its determinant ( for any dimension ) is 1.@xmath31 ( matrix ( [ divisor matrix ] ) is closely related to the redheffer matrix , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite . )",
    "introducing@xmath32 we see that @xmath33 just counts the number of all divisors of a given @xmath0 including both unity and @xmath0 itself .",
    "it is known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that the inverse of matrix ( [ divisor matrix ] ) is:@xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the mbius function:@xmath36{l}$0 $ if $ n$ has squared prime factor\\\\ $ + 1 $ if $ n$ is a square - free positive integer with an even number of prime factors\\\\ $ -1 $ if $ n$ is a square - free positive integer with an odd number of prime factors \\end{tabular } \\right .",

    "the particular choice of the exponential function in ( [ alpha3 ] ) is not crucial to our reasoning .",
    "indeed , instead of this function we can take _ any _ regular function @xmath42 provided that it has all non - zero coefficients in its power series expansion@xmath43 thus in general we have ( up to appropriate normalizing factor)@xmath44    for example , taking@xmath45 we get:@xmath46 or simply@xmath47 taking@xmath48 we get:@xmath49    the general explicit formula for @xmath16 using arbitrary function @xmath50 satisfying ( [ expansion ] ) is:@xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the @xmath7-th derivative of @xmath50 with respect to @xmath8 taken at @xmath27 .",

    "let us now explain in more details how it all works .",
    "the thing is that all formulas for @xmath16  presented so far encode , at least to some extent , the ancient algorithm known as the sieve of eratosthenes .",

    "this produces a single line of ones on the diagonal @xmath77  in the divisor matrix ( [ divisor matrix ] )  cf .",

    "this is equivalent to the trivial statement that all integers are divisible both by one and by themselves .",
    "let us further consider more precise approximation @xmath78 .",
    "we get from ( [ alpha8 ] ) another sequence of ones on the line @xmath79 .",
    "this is equivalent to selecting all even integers @xmath0 and adding to the divisor matrix ( [ divisor matrix ] ) their divisors @xmath80 . taking into account higher powers of @xmath8",
    "we select all numbers @xmath0  which are multiplies of @xmath81 and this adds to the matrix further lines of divisors : @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "proceeding in the same way we finally arrive at the full expansion of @xmath3:@xmath83 which produces the entire sequence of lines @xmath84 labelled by parameter @xmath85 . in this way we have selected and visualized _ all divisors for all integers_. it is clear that there are certain well - defined numbers @xmath0 ( marked in bold in figure 2 ) which have exactly two divisors : unity and themselves , i.e. prime numbers : @xmath86 at the same time we see the importance of condition @xmath87  in ( [ expansion ] ) since even a single coefficient @xmath88 would cause a skipping of certain divisors . in view of this",
    "the characteristic function for divisors may also be written in a very natural form as a sum over kronecker deltas:@xmath89",
    "note that combining ( [ sigma ] ) , ( [ alpha8 ] ) and ( [ f ] ) gives:@xmath90 hence@xmath91 which is consistent with the theory of lambert series ( see e.g. @xcite ) which is the generating function for the sequence @xmath33 where @xmath33  is the total number of divisors for a given integer @xmath0 .",

    "rows are labelled by consecutive integers @xmath0 and columns are labelled by potential divisors @xmath1 .",
    "each colored disc means that given @xmath1 actually divides @xmath0 , otherwise there is small black circle .",
    "to better visualize the whole pattern discs are in 3 different colors and lines connecting them are drawn .",
    "of course , above the diagonal ( @xmath92 ) there ca nt be any divisors .",
    "a few elementary comments at the end of this note .",
    "as we have seen , all divisors @xmath1 of integers @xmath0 lie on rays passing through the origin of the coordinate system on the ( @xmath93 ) plane and are labelled by an integer parameter @xmath94@xmath95 we have also seen that this simple condition has a natural interpretation since @xmath7 may be identified with the exponent in @xmath96 in the expansion ( [ expansion ] ) .",
    "the key thing is that these rays must pass through certain points of an integer lattice and only then a potential divisor  can be an actual divisor . for large @xmath0",
    "these rays typically get closer and closer to one another .",
    "therefore we qualitatively see why it is so difficult to factorize large integers .    moreover , numerical experiments suggest that _ all _ divisors lie on countable families of parabolas passing through the origin ( see figures 3 , 4 and 5 below ) .",
    "these parabolas are `` quantized '' in the sense that each family is characterized by two discrete parameters @xmath97 and @xmath98 and inside any family parabolas are labelled by another integer parameter @xmath99:@xmath100 careful simulations using mathematica revealed that parameter @xmath99 assumes equidistant values with integer constant step:@xmath101 starting from @xmath102 where @xmath103 denotes greatest common divisor , i.e. @xmath102 , @xmath104 , @xmath105       + figure 4 .",

    "finally , it should be stressed that , unfortunately , expressions presented in this note do not tell us much about distribution of primes .",
