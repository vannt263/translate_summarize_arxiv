    "the investigations of neutron star seismic vibrations offer unique opportunity of studying their internal structure , solid - mechanical and electrodynamical properties of superdense degenerate matter .",
    "the most conspicuous feature of these non - convective solid stars is the capability of accommodating magnetic fields of extremely high intensity@xcite that serve as a chief promoter of their observable electromagnetic activity .",
    "the absence of nuclear energy sources in these final stage ( fs ) stars suggests that their magnetic fields are definitely not generated by persistent current - carrying flows in self - exciting dynamo processes , as is the case of liquid main - sequence ( ms ) stars .",
    "it seems quite likely , therefore , that stability to spontaneous decay@xcite of fossil magnetic fields of isolated neutron stars@xcite is maintained by permanent magnetization of neutron - dominated ( poorly conducting ) degenerate fermi - matter .",
    "such an understanding has been laid at the base of paramagnetic neutron star model@xcite . in this model",
    "the degenerate fermi - matter of non - relativistic neutrons ( whose degeneracy pressure withstands the pressure of self - gravity ) is regarded as being in the permanently magnetized state of field - induced pauli s paramagnetic saturation which is characterized by alignment of spin magnetic moments of neutrons along the axis of frozen - in magnetic field .",
    "the most striking dynamical manifestation of spin paramagnetic polarization of non - conducing neutron matter is that such a matter can transmit perturbations by transverse magneto - mechanical waves ; in such a wave the vector - fields of magnetization and material displacements undergo coupled differentially rotational vibrations traveling along the axis of magnetic field . in a spherical mass of paramagnetic neutron star",
    "this unique feature of field - induced spin magnetic polarization of neutron matter is manifested in that such a star can undergo solely torsional vibrations about axis of its dipole magnetic moment .",
    "based on this finding , it was argued in above works that the model of paramagnetic neutron star executing torsional axisymmetric vibrations , weakly damped by nuclear matter viscosity , is able to explain long periodic ( @xmath0 $ ] s  non - typical to young neutron stars ) pulsed character of magnetar radiation ( both , soft gamma repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars ) in seismically quiescent regime of their emission , as being produced by torsional vibrations , rather than rotation as is the case of radio pulsars .",
    "recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in torsional vibrations of magnetars , prompted by observations@xcite of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) during the outburst flare from sgr 0525 - 66 , sgr 1806 - 20 , and sgr 1900 + 14 .",
    "the statistics of x - ray burst of sgrs exhibits typical for earthquakes features@xcite .",
    "it is believed , therefore , that detected qpos are of seismic origin .",
    "particular attention in this development of magnetar asteroseismology has been paid to the following set of data on qpo frequencies@xcite @xmath1}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding periods are substantially shorter than the above mentioned periods of seismically quiescent pulsed emission . in works@xcite motivated by this discovery , several models of post - quake vibrational relaxation of above magnetars have been investigated .",
    "particular attention has been given to the regime of node - free or nodeless shear axisymmetric vibrations .",
    "this regime is interesting in its own right because such vibrations have been and still are poorly investigated in theoretical asteroseismology of both solid fs stars and such solid celestial objects as earth - like planets@xcite . in particular , in works@xcite , a case of the elastic - force - driven nodeless shear oscillations , both torsional  @xmath2 and spheroidal  @xmath3 , entrapped in the crust of finite depth @xmath4 has been studied in some details with remarkable inference that dipole overtones of spheroidal and torsion vibrations of crust against immobile core exhibit features generic to goldstone soft modes . on the other hand , one can probably cast doubt on arguments of the model presuming the dominant role of solid - mechanical hooke s force of elastic stresses because such interpretation rests on poorly justifiable assumption about dynamically passive role of an ultra strong magnetic field , that is , that the field frozen in the star remains unaltered in the process of vibrations . bearing this in mind and assuming that the presence of charged particles in neutron - dominated stellar matter imparts to it the properties of electric conductor , in works@xcite ,",
    "the post - quake relaxation of above magnetars has been studied in the model of perfectly conducting solid star executing global torsional vibrations restored by joint action of lorentz force of magnetic field stresses and hooke s force of solid - mechanical elastic stresses .",
    "it was found that such a model provides fairly reasonable account of general trends in qpo frequencies for all data from sgr 1900 + 14 and for sgr 1900 + 14 from the range @xmath5 hz , but faces serious difficulties in interpreting low - frequency vibrations with @xmath6 and @xmath7 hz in data from sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    "also , the model of global torsional vibrations leaves some uncertainties regarding the nature of vibrations with @xmath8 and @xmath9 hz .",
    "this last issue has been scrutinized in recent work@xcite from the standpoint of a solid star model with non - homogeneous poloidal magnetic field of well - known ferraro s form .",
    "and it was found that these high - frequency qpos can be properly explained as being produced by very high overtones of node - free torsional alfvn oscillations .    as a logical extension of above line of investigation , in this paper we consider in some details a case of node - free torsional vibrations locked in the crust with focus on toroidal alfvn mode . in so",
    "doing we work from the two - component model of paramagnetic neutron star , pictured in fig.1 , whose crust and core materials are regarded as endowed with substantially different electrodynamic properties .",
    "the immobile massive core , primarily consisting of degenerate neutron matter in the above described permanently magnetized state of pauli s paramagnetic saturation , is regarded as a main source of magnetic field of the star crust .",
    "this implies that the core material is just incapable of sustaining alfvn vibrations which owe their existence to extremely large ( effectively infinite ) electrical conductivity of matter@xcite .",
    "the micro - composition of crust , which is dominated by nuclei embedded in degenerate fermi- gas of relativistic electrons , suggests that its metal - like material possesses properties of perfectly conducting solid - state plasma .",
    "such a view suggests that seismic stability of the star to quake - induced tectonic displacements of crust against core is primarily determined by well - known effect of magnetic ( magnet - metal ) cohesion mediated by magnetic field lines which operate as a super - hard piles endowing the core - crust construction of neutron star with supplementary ( to gravity forces ) stiffness of magnetic nature .",
    "the intermediate layer between core and crust ( the inner crust whose density several times less than the core density ) is most likely composed of quasi - boson matter of paired neutrons .",
    "but it is highly unlikely that such quasi- boson matter is capable of undergoing phase transition to the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) which is characterized by vanishingly small pressure .",
    "this suggests that bec state of paired neutrons , if exist , can only insufficiently contribute to the total mass budget of neutron star  a compact object in which pressure of self - gravity is brought to equilibrium by degeneracy fermi - pressure of non - relativistic neutrons in the core and relativistic electrons in the crust . in seismo - dynamics of the paramagnetic neutron star under consideration the inner crust",
    "is thought of as operating like a lubricant facilitating differentially rotational shear displacements of crust relative to much denser matter of massive core . from the view point of this core - crust model ,",
    "the star - quake is though of as impulsive release of energy of magnetic core - crust cohesion ( by means of disruption of magnetic field lines on the core - crust interface ) resulting in the crust fracturing by revealed magnetic stresses . in this paper",
    "we focus , however , not on dynamics of quake , but on the post - quake vibrational relaxation of the star , namely , on node - free torsional oscillations of crustal solid - state plasma about axis of magnetic field frozen in an immobile paramagnetic core . in section 2 ,",
    "a brief outline is given of theory of solid - magnetics appropriate for the perfectly conducting viscoelastic continuous medium pervaded by a magnetic field . in section 3 ,",
    "the spectral formulas for the frequency and lifetime of differentially rotational , torsional , nodeless vibrations of the crust restored by combined action of magnetic lorentz and elastic hooke s forces are obtained . in section 4 ,",
    "the computed frequency spectra are used for the forward asteroseismic analysis of the fast oscillations of x - ray outburst from above mentioned magnetars .",
    "the obtained results are briefly summarized in section 5 .",

    ", one can use one and the same spectral formula for the @xmath70-pole specification of detected qpos which in above notations is written as @xmath114 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the results presented in fig.9 and fig.10 show that at indicated input parameters , i.e. , the alfvn frequency @xmath104 and the fractional depth of seismogenic layer @xmath92 , the model too adequately reproduces general trends in the data with fairly reasonable @xmath70-pole specification of overtones pointed out by integer numbers along x - axis .",
    "it is seen that the low - frequency qpos in data for sgr 1806 - 20 , are interpreted as dipole and quadrupole overtones : @xmath115 and @xmath116 hz . and the high - frequency kilohertz vibrations with @xmath117 hz and",
    "@xmath118 hz are unambiguously specified as high - multipole overtones : @xmath119 hz and @xmath120 hz .",
    "however , in this latter scenario of lorentz - force - dominated vibrations the best fit of data is attained at fairly large value of fractional depth , @xmath121 , which is much larger than the expected depth of the crust . in our opinion , this result may be regarded as indication to that the detected qpos are formed by coherent vibrations of crustal solid - state plasma and plasma of magnetar corona .",
    "ever since identification of pulsars with rapidly rotating neutron stars it has been argued@xcite that two key properties of these compact objects ",
    "( i ) the degeneracy of neutron ( non - conducting ) fermi - matter whose pressure opposes the pressure of self - gravity , and ( ii ) a highly stable to decay super - strong magnetic fields  can be reconciled , if poorly conducting neutron - dominated stellar matter , constituting the neutron star cores , has been brought to gravitational equilibrium in the permanently magnetized state .",
    "the most plausible is the state of pauli s paramagnetic saturation with spin magnetic moments of neutrons polarized along the axis of fossil field inherited from massive progenitor and amplified in magnetic - flux - conserving core- collapse supernova@xcite .",
    "this idea is central to the considered two - component , core - crust , model of paramagnetic neutron star whose less dense and highly conducting , metal - like , material of the crust is considered as a solid - state , electron - nuclear , plasma pervaded by frozen in the core magnetic field .",
    "this difference between electrodynamic properties of core and crust matter ( permanently magnetized non - conducting core and perfectly conducting non- magnetic crust ) suggests that magnetic cohesion between massive core ( permanent magnet ) and crust ( metal - like material ) should plays central role in seismic activity of the star .",
    "working from such an understanding , we have computed frequency spectra of node - free torsional oscillations of crust against immobile core under the action lorentz and hooke restoring forces and damped by newtonian viscous force . as a trial function of oscillating material displacements",
    "we have used the node - free toroidal field computed from vector laplace equation .",
    "the obtained spectral formulas are of some interest in their own right because they can be applied to more wide class of celestial objects . in this work we applied the obtained analytic frequency spectra to magnetars , highly magnetized quaking neutron stars whose bursting seismic activity",
    "is commonly associated with release of magnetic field stresses .",
    "focus was laid on forward asteroseismic analysis of fast x - ray flux oscillations during the giant flare of sgr 1900 + 14 and sgr 1806 - 20 and , thus , assuming that these oscillations are produced by torsion vibrations of crustal solid - state plasma about axis of dipole magnetic field frozen in the immobile permanently magnetized core . in so doing we have investigated two cases of post - quake vibrational relaxation of the star , depending on restoring forces . in first case",
    ", the analysis of data has been based on assumption that detected qpos owe their existence to node - free torsional vibrations of crust against core restored by joint action of lorentz magnetic and hooke s elastic forces . and we found that obtained three - parametric spectral formula provides much better fit of data than two - parametric frequency spectrum of global vibrations ( bastrukov et al 2009a ) .",
    "the considered second scenario presumes that vibrations are dominated by solely lorentz restoring force of magnetic field stresses .",
    "we found that obtained two - parametric frequency spectrum can too be fairly reasonably reconciled with detected qpos frequencies .",
    "all the above lead us to conclude that lorentz restoring force of magnetic field stresses plays decisive part in quake - induced torsional vibrations of crustal solid - state plasma of magnetars ."
