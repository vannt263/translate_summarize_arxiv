    "the pseudogap ( pg ) regime of the hole - doped cuprates is possibly one of the most enigmatic phases of matter .",
    "it has often been described as one of the central problems in the physics of high - temperature superconductivity ( sc ) .",
    "it is identified by the onset of a large gap ( @xmath2 mev ) below a temperature , @xmath3 , as observed in a number of different probes .",
    "the gap persists down to the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath4 , below which of course the system develops the usual superconducting gap .",
    "the nature of the fermionic excitations in the pg phase is particularly interesting  the aforementioned gap is present in the anti - nodal regions of the brillouin zone close to momenta @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; there exists , however , a region close to the nodes that remains gapless as has been detected via arpes experiments @xcite .",
    "these regions are commonly referred to as the fermi-arcs \" .",
    "a topic of intense debate has been whether in addition to pairing fluctuations , any other possibly short - ranged and fluctuating phase with broken symmetry is also present above @xmath7 , and below the onset of the pseudogap .",
    "investigating the precise nature of this short - range order will likely shed some light on the  normal \" state out of which it emerges .",
    "the different perspectives on this short - range order in the pg phase can be divided into two classes ( _ i _ ) the order is ` quantum disordered ' and there are fractionalized excitations and associated topological excitations @xcite , or ( _ ii _ ) the order is `` classically disordered '' primarily due to thermal fluctuations . here",
    ", we shall explore consequences arising from the second point of view .",
    "implications of these thermal fluctuations on the phenomenology of the pseudogap phase , with comparison to various experiments , have also been explored recently @xcite .",
    "a huge leap in our understanding came about with the discovery of quantum oscillations caused by a small electron - like pocket at very large magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "this was the first clear evidence of the  normal \" state in the pseudogap phase under large magnetic fields having some resemblance to a metallic state .",
    "more recently , in a series of remarkable experiments , it has become clear that the reconstructed electron - like pocket is caused by an incommensurate charge - density wave ( cdw ) , competing with superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the wavevector of this charge - density wave , which is of the type @xmath8 , appears to be linked to the fermi surface in the anti - nodal regions .",
    "furthermore , diamagnetism measurements in ybco show significant fluctuation diamagnetism over approximately the same range of temperatures where x - ray experiments measure charge order fluctuations , indicating that there are significant superconducting fluctuations in this phase @xcite .",
    "a natural question that needs to be addressed is if both sc and cdw arise out of the same physics .    in the underdoped cuprates , due to the proximity to an antiferromagnet ( af ) close to half - filling",
    ", the susceptibility , @xmath9 , is peaked around @xmath10 , ( @xmath11 when the fluctuations are peaked around an incommensurate wavevector ) @xcite .",
    "it is now well - understood that a metal interacting via such antiferromagnetic exchange interactions is unstable to @xmath0wave superconductivity at low temperatures @xcite . however , an interesting consequence of the af exchange interactions is that they also give rise to a secondary instability to a charge - density wave with a predominantly @xmath1-wave form factor @xcite .",
    "significant recent developments have been the evidence for the predicted @xmath1-wave form factor in x - ray observations @xcite , and a direct phase - sensitive measurement of the @xmath1-wave form factor in scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will turn our attention to the wavevector of this cdw , and in particular , its connection to the sc fluctuations .",
    "a number of recent works have addressed such issues @xcite . in refs .  , the wavevector of the leading cdw instability has been found to be of the form @xmath12 , while the experimentally observed wavevector was a subleading instability . at this point",
    "it is useful to introduce some new notation . from now on , we shall often refer to the experimentally observed cdw with wavevectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 as  cdw - a \" and the one with wavevectors @xmath15 as  cdw - b \" ( see fig.[bz ] ) .",
    "more recently , it has been pointed out that in the presence of strong correlations arising from on - site and nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion , it is possible to obtain a stable cdw - a phase , with the wavevectors seen in experiments , in a certain window of parameter space @xcite .",
    "wang and chubukov @xcite examined retardation effects linked to the damping of spin fluctuations with a long correlation length , and argued for an extension of cdw - a with time - reversal symmetry breaking . in this paper , we will show that upon accounting for the interplay between superconductivity and charge - order in the underdoped cuprates , the cdw state with the correct wavevector ( _ i.e. _ cdw - a ) appears to be preferred over cdw - b over at least a small temperature window , as long as the antinodal regions of the fermi - surface are reasonably nested with a small curvature ( a criterion to be made more precise later ) @xcite . in fig.[bz",
    "] , @xmath16 represents the separation between two neighboring  hot - spots \" .",
    "however , our computations in this paper are applicable for a range of different values of @xmath16 that connect points in the antinodal regions and can be different from the hot - spot wavevector .",
    "_ @xcite have also recently looked at the effect of superconducting fluctuations on charge - order in a different setup .",
    "we also note our recent work @xcite , which employs a `` quantum disordered '' model of the pseudogap as a topological metal , and proposes an alternative mechanism for charge ordering at the ( @xmath17 ) , ( @xmath18 ) wavevectors .",
    "our paper is organized as follows :",
    "in section [ hf ] , we introduce the theory of a metal interacting via antiferromagnetic exchange interactions ( henceforth referred to as @xmath19 model , but without any on - site coulomb repulsion ) and review a hartree - fock analysis for various charge - ordering and pair - density wave instabilities .",

    "in this section , we briefly review some of the earlier results @xcite obtained by carrying out a hartree - fock ( hf ) analysis of the t - j model ( without any gutzwiller projection ) .",

    "we are interested in looking at the various instabilities that can arise in this model in the particle - particle as well as particle - hole channel .",
    "we shall restrict our attention to pair - density wave ( pdw ) , where the sc condensate carries a finite momentum , and charge - density wave states .",
    "we ignore the possibility of having spin - order , partly motivated by most experiments on the non - la - based cuprates ( e.g. ybco and bscco ) , where the region of charge - order has hardly any overlap with that of spin - order @xcite . for the hartree - fock analysis , we need the best variational estimate for the following mean - field hamiltonian , h_mf=_. in the above , @xmath32 represents the electronic dispersion .",

    "there is little difference between the results for @xmath50 and @xmath11 .    in figs .",
    "[ eigfig ] ( a ) and ( b ) we plot the lowest eigenvalues @xmath51 , obtained after diagonalizing eqns.[eig ] on a discrete brillouin zone with @xmath52 points .",

    "( b ) @xmath54 as a function of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we use a band - structure with @xmath57 ( corresponding to the same fermi - surface used in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the other parameters are @xmath58 and @xmath59 . for the pair - density wave ,",
    "the global minimum is located at @xmath60 while for the charge - order , it is located at @xmath61 ( cdw - b ) . in ( b ) , note the valleys extending from @xmath62 to @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( cdw - a)the latter are local , but not global , minima . ]    let us start with a discussion of the pair - density wave state ( fig.[eigfig]a ) .",
    "not surprisingly , the state with @xmath60 is the leading instability and in particular , @xmath63 for @xmath60 has a logarithmic divergence as @xmath64 .",
    "we do not find any other local - minima in phase - space ; the bcs - log for @xmath60 simply overwhelms any other pdw state that might have otherwise arisen within this weak - coupling approach .",
    "comparing the numerical values of the eigenvalues @xmath65 and @xmath66 in figs.[eigfig ] ( a ) and ( b ) , it is clear that @xmath63 ( at @xmath60 ) is the smallest .",
    "therefore , in the presence of short - range af interactions , the leading weak - coupling quadratic instability indeed turns out to be to a sc ( with @xmath0wave symmetry ; this information is contained in the structure of @xmath67 ) .    for the charge - ordering instability ( fig.[eigfig]b ) ,",
    "the global minimum is located at the diagonal wavevector @xmath62 .",
    "this corresponds to the cdw - b state introduced earlier .",
    "however notice the  valleys \" of local minima extending from this wavevector to @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the cdw - a .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the form factors associated with these cdws , @xmath68 , primarily have a @xmath0wave component . in real space",
    ", this implies that the charge - density modulation is mostly on the cu - cu links ( bonds ) rather than on the sites .",
    "hence they are also referred to as bond - ordered states .",
    "the reason why cdw - b turned out to be the leading cdw instability is actually related to two features in our problem above : _",
    "( i ) _ the absence of a gap in the spectrum at the antinodes , and , _",
    "( ii ) _ an _ emergent _ particle - hole symmetry associated with the exchange interactions , @xmath69 .",
    "this exchange interaction is invariant under independent su(2 ) rotations on each lattice site that map particles to holes and vice - versa .",
    "these rotations therefore naturally map sc to cdw - b . in the absence of any fermi - surface curvature or other interaction terms that break this symmetry , both of these instabilites would be exactly degenerate .",
    "however , once it is broken , cdw - b becomes a sub - leading instability ( sc is always guaranteed to remain the leading instability even in the presence of a curvature since the points @xmath37 are always  nested \" .",
    "however , a very large nearest neighbor coulomb interaction term , @xmath70 , can suppress superconductivity , for instance ) .",
    "we also note in passing that cdw - a is mapped to the pdw @xcite at the same wave - vector under these rotations ; we do not consider this pdw here because it does not appear as a preferred eigenvalue of @xmath65 in fig .",
    "[ eigfig]a .",
    "the above analysis was carried out in the limit where the different orders were decoupled from each other , i.e. we did not look at the feedback of one over the other and analyzed the free - energy @xmath38 to only quadratic order .",
    "let us therefore now construct a minimal model for sc and cdw fluctuations in a metal and analyze the effective theory beyond quadratic order in the next section .",
    "consider now a model for the fermions with a generic fermi - surface as shown in fig.[bz ] . based on our hf analysis in the previous section , we know",
    "the ( sub-)leading instabilities were to a ( i ) @xmath0wave superconductor , ( ii ) cdw - b with wavevectors @xmath15 , and , ( iii ) cdw - a with wavevectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we can use this information to construct a model for a metal with strong pairing and cdw fluctuations .",
    "therefore , we consider the theory for the fermions coupled to superconducting ( @xmath71 ) and cdw ( @xmath72 ) fluctuations ( which are in their uncondensed phase , as is the case in the pg regime ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is then given by , h&=&h_0+h_s+h_b ,   + h_0&=&_(_- )   c_,^c _ , , + h_s&=&_(_s ( )  c^_+/2,c^_-+/2,_+ ) , + h_b&= & _ , . in the above , @xmath73 is the usual form factor associated with @xmath0wave superconductivity and @xmath40 is the form - factor for cdw with wave - vector @xmath35 .",
    "we would now like to obtain an effective action in terms of @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( both cdw - a and b ) after integrating out the fermions .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the effect of sc fluctuations on these two different cdw states and to analyze if the competition between the different order parameters can preferentially select a particular state",
    ". it will be particularly interesting if this state corresponds to the one that has been seen experimentally .",
    "instead of carrying out the above task with the full fermi - surface , let us analyze the theory in the vicinity of the hot - spots labelled @xmath74 in fig.[bz ] .",
    "we expand the dispersion close to the hot - spots so that _ , j = v_f,_jk_+ k_^2 , with @xmath75 being the momentum normal ( parallel ) to the fermi surface . the fermi - velocities are given by , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",

    "we have explored the wavevectors that can arise in our hf computation in section [ hf ] , while the form factors associated with the different cdw orders for the full underlying fermi - surface were already computed in ref.@xcite . in this section",
    ", we shall revisit this issue within our low - energy formulation .",
    "if we go back to eqn.[fsc ] and focus only on the terms involving charge - order , we obtain f_c=_. we now assume that @xmath82 is peaked at @xmath83 and perform the integrations over @xmath84 and @xmath85 in patches in the neigborhoods of the hot - spots that satisfy the above constraint .",
    "furthermore , we assume that @xmath40 can be treated as piecewise constant in the patches and treat @xmath86 as static and non - critical , i.e. @xmath87 . for cdw - b , let us focus on the hot - spot pairs @xmath88 and @xmath89 where @xmath40 takes the values @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "similarly , for cdw - a , we choose to focus on the pairs @xmath92 and @xmath93 where @xmath40 takes the values @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that for cdw - b , @xmath96 evaluated in the patches @xmath88 and @xmath89 are equal to each other due to purely geometric reasons , i.e. @xmath97 , so that , f_c|_b=^b + ( ^b)^2 .",
    "it is simple to diagonalize the above quadratic form and obtain the optimum linear combination of @xmath90 and @xmath91 . for cdw - b ,",
    "the eigenvector corresponding to the lower eigenvalue has a purely @xmath0wave form .",
    "we can now do the same computation for cdw - a and we immediately find that @xmath98 ( once again , for purely geometric reasons ) , so that , f_c|_a=^a_1|^a_1|^2 + ^a_2|^a_2|^2 + ^a_1^a_2 .",

    "this modifies the eigenvectors except when the lowest eigenvalue is zero .",
    "it was argued @xcite that the appropriate similarity transform is determined by looking at the structure of the particle - hole t - matrix , which leads to the requirement that the diagonal terms in the quadratic form have equal values . in this manner",

    "a , the competition between the @xmath201 components , @xmath154 , far exceeds @xmath143 , i.e. @xmath202 . the implication is that at low enough temperatures , cdw - a would necessarily have a tendency to form stripe - like , instead of checkerboard , order @xcite which would spontaneously break the underlying @xmath203 symmetry of the lattice . on the other hand , with only cdw - b order , due to the absence of any competition between its @xmath201 components , there wo nt be any tendency to break the @xmath203 symmetry .",
    "there is indication for the cdw being unidirectional and stripe - like in the absence of a magnetic field in various experiments .",
    "let us now discuss an important feature of our analysis , involving the @xmath204 terms that describe the competition of the different cdws with sc .",
    "we find that @xmath205 , implying that at low enough temperatures , sc competes with cdw - b much more strongly than with cdw - a .",
    "however , this is not surprising for the following reason : in our linearized hot - spot theory , there is no fundamental difference between cdw - b and sc due to the su(2 ) symmetry .",
    "in fact both of these orders are strongly coupled to each other and compete for density of states on the fermi - surface in the vicinity of the same hot - spots .",
    "therefore , it is natural for them to compete with each other more strongly .",
    "the same is not true about cdw - a and sc , which compete for density of states along different portions of the fermi - surface .",
    "note that cdw - a and cdw - b also compete mutually , so suppressing one naturally makes it favorable for the other one to emerge .     fields ( solid - double lines ) in ( a ) @xmath206 , ( b ) @xmath207 renormalize the @xmath208 term , and , ( c ) @xmath209 , ( d ) @xmath210 renormalize the @xmath211 term . ]    to summarize , the results of this section indicate that at very high temperatures , there is an almost perfect symmetry between cdw - b and sc ( in fact , this symmetry persists even in the presence of a finite curvature , as we shall show in the next section ) which makes it unfavorable for cdw - a to appear in the scene .",
    "however , as a function of decreasing temperature , as the strength of superconducting fluctuations increase , the cdw - b fluctuations are preferentially suppressed compared to cdw - a , which could possibly allow cdw - a to emerge . the exact crossovers , if any , are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the net effect of the sc fluctuations is to effectively renormalize the quadratic terms in the action for @xmath127 and @xmath128 , as shown in fig.[ren ] . at low temperatures ,",
    "the coefficient of @xmath211 is renormalized more strongly compared to the coefficient of @xmath208 . in order to extract an estimate of the relative renormalizations ,",
    "let us compute @xmath212 and @xmath213 for cdw - a , b due to purely thermal and gaussian fluctuations associated with superconductivity , @xmath214 .",
    "this approximation is valid sufficiently far away from the superconducting @xmath4 .",
    "the renormalizations are then given by , r_a & & s_a - ( ) = - ( ) , + r_b & & s_b - ( ) = - ( ) . hence , the relative renormalizations @xmath215 , which indicates that within our simplified theory , there exists an intermediate range of temperatures where the transition temperature for cdw - b gets suppressed more than the one for cdw - a .",
    "the only caveat in the calculations presented in this section is that all of them were performed in the limit of @xmath216 .",
    "of course , in the actual problem , the curvature is finite ( albeit small , in the anti - nodal region ) . therefore , we revisit the whole problem with a non - zero curvature in the next section and analyze the consequences numerically .",
    "we would like to remind the reader , that at the level of approximation that we have used in this section , the cdw - a state is degenerate with the corresponding pdw state and the two compete strongly with each other .",
    "however , in the presence of a curvature or other features that break the su(2 ) symmetry , the pdw state is destroyed completely , at least within the weak - coupling picture ( unlike the other states , as we saw in fig.[eigfig ] ) . moreover , as we shall see in the next section , the competition effects between cdw - a , b and sc discussed above survive even in the presence of curvature as long as the temperature is higher than a scale set by @xmath80 .      in the previous section we ignored the effect of the fermi - surface curvature completely and analyzed the linearized theory in the vicinity of the hot - spots .",
    "most of the graphs that we evaluated were singular in the limit of @xmath64 ( though we intend to apply our results to the metallic state at strictly @xmath217 ) .",
    "the question we would now like to address is to what extent do these results remain valid and what is the regime of validity , in the presence of a finite curvature .",
    "in fact , it is possible that the curvature sets a temperature scale above which our analytical results for the linearized theory continue to hold .",
    "we shall denote all the previously evaluated integrals by @xmath218 , to distinguish them from the symbols used earlier .",
    "this time around , we shall perform the matsubara sums first and then evaluate the momentum - integrals numerically as a function of temperature for various fixed values of curvature , @xmath80 , and @xmath219 .",
    "the aim of this computation is two - fold .",
    "first of all , in the limit of @xmath216 , we should recover the temperature dependencies of the different terms obtained earlier .",
    "secondly , we would like to have an approximate estimate of the functional form of @xmath220 , the temperature scale above which our analytical results for the @xmath141 problem continue to hold , assuming such a scale exists .    in the presence of a finite curvature ,",
    "the modified dispersions are now given by , _",
    "1()&=&v_xk_x+v_yk_y+(k_x^2+k_y^2 ) , + _",
    "2()&=&v_xk_x - v_yk_y+(k_x^2+k_y^2 ) , with @xmath221 , @xmath222 and so on .",
    "we only present the main findings of this analysis in the present section .",
    "the technical details of the computations alongwith plots of the numerical results are provided in appendix [ intcurv ] .",
    "let us start by analyzing the temperature dependence of diagrams ( @xmath223 ) contributing to @xmath143 .",
    "we found that ( i ) at a fixed value of @xmath224 , but for @xmath225 , @xmath223 goes to a constant value in the limit of @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , in the limit of @xmath216 , this constant is nearly identical to what we had computed earlier for @xmath226 ( eqn.[iua ] ) .",
    "( ii ) on the other hand , for @xmath227 , there is a power - law fall off going as @xmath228 for all considered values of @xmath80 , which again matches with our analytical result for @xmath226 ( eqn.[iua ] ) .",
    "( iii ) finally , @xmath223 scales as @xmath229 , which was apparent from the perfect scaling collapse that we observed for @xmath230 ( not shown ) .",
    "this agrees with our analytical results from earlier , even though they were computed with @xmath141 .",
    "the numerically evaluated results for @xmath223 are shown in fig.[curvi](a ) .",
    "we next computed the leading diagrams contributing to @xmath154 , giving rise to competition between @xmath231 and @xmath232 components of cdw - a .",
    "we came across the following interesting results : ( i ) irrespective of the value of the curvature , the diagrams all asymptote to a @xmath187 behavior at low temperatures ( upto @xmath233 ) .",
    "( ii ) there were however deviations at higher temperatures .",
    "( iii ) finally , this particular diagram also scales as @xmath234 ( not shown ) .",
    "the plots as a function of temperature are shown in fig.[curvi](b ) .",
    "it is especially interesting to see that even in the presence of a small curvature , @xmath154 continues to scale as @xmath187 down to very low temperatures .",
    "however , as a function of decreasing temperature , there will be a preemptive instability to superconductivity , which in turn will cut - off the @xmath187 behavior to @xmath235 , where @xmath236 is the superconducting gap .",
    "let us now revisit the terms that turned out to be the most singular in our earlier analysis , which includes @xmath237 ( @xmath238 ) and @xmath188 ( @xmath239 ) , and went as @xmath228 . as a reminder ,",
    "in the linearized theory , we obtained @xmath240 .",
    "however , a finite curvature breaks this symmetry .",
    "we first focussed on the temperature - dependence of these diagrams at a fixed @xmath224 but different values of @xmath80 and noticed the following common features : ( i ) the limit of @xmath216 computation agrees perfectly with the analytical computation from the previous section .",
    "( ii ) with an increasing @xmath80 , we note that the results for the different computations ( i.e. with and without @xmath80 ) only agree with each other above a characteristic temperature , @xmath241 , with @xmath242 different for each diagram ( this is determined by noting the temperature , @xmath243 , at which the deviation starts ; these are marked by the dotted vertical lines in fig.[curv1t2 ] ) . to investigate whether @xmath244 is @xmath245dependent , we computed the same diagrams as a function of temperature at a fixed @xmath225 and @xmath246 , but for different values of @xmath224 .",
    "remarkably , the value of @xmath243 remains unaffected by changing @xmath224 , which shows that @xmath244 is independent of @xmath224 .",
    "( iii ) we also observed them to scale as @xmath247 , just like in all the previous cases .",
    "therefore , to summarize , @xmath237 and @xmath188 continue to behave as @xmath191 above a temperature scale that is set by curvature , @xmath248 .",
    "therefore , at high enough temperatures compared to this scale , the degeneracy between cdw - b and sc is maintained and the competition is sufficiently weak that it is unlikely that cdw - a will be a preferred state , based on our arguments from the previous section .",
    "it is however important to remind ourselves that the coefficient of @xmath133 , which also goes as @xmath228 , survives even in the presence of a finite curvature but is eventually cut - off by @xmath236 .",
    "the numerically evaluated results are shown as a function of temperature in fig.[curv1t2 ] ( a)-(f ) .",
    "finally , we also evaluated the term responsible for competition between sc and cdw - a .",
    "recall that in the linearized theory , @xmath249 and where the leading singularities were all @xmath159 .",
    "however , in the presence of a finite @xmath80 these degeneracies are lifted . however , all the diagrams continue to behave as @xmath159 down to temperatures of @xmath250 , even in the presence of a reasonably large @xmath80 . however , as a function of decreasing temperature , the system will go superconducting thereby cuting - off the singularity .",
    "we have also checked that just like all the other diagrams considered so far , these diagrams also scale as @xmath229 .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[curvmn ] ( a)-(c ) .    towards the end of section [ reshs ]",
    ", we saw that the three - point functions between cdw - a and b turned out to be identically zero .",
    "however , when we evaluated the same diagrams in the presence of a finite curvature , they turned out to be non - zero .",
    "in fact , based on the numerically evaluated results , we were able to guess an analytical functional form for @xmath251 , which is as follows , ( t , , ) .",
    "note that it indeed reproduces the @xmath216 limit correctly and approaches a constant in the limit of @xmath64 otherwise .",
    "the numerically evaluated results and a comparison with @xmath252 is shown in fig.[y261](a ) , ( b ) .    to conclude this section",
    ", we found that at sufficiently high temperatures , our results from the previous section continue to hold even in the presence of a finite , but small , curvature .",
    "the terms that we found to be most singular in our earlier computation ( @xmath228 ) , continue to have the same form as long as @xmath253 . on the other hand , the terms that went as @xmath159 , continue to be so down to very low temperatures compared to the scales set by the fermi - velocities",
    ". however , as a function of decreasing temperature , these singularities are cut - off eventually by the preemptive instability to superconductivity .",
    "it is therefore safe to conclude that our computations in section [ reshs ] are applicable in the window @xmath254 .",
    "over the past few years , we have learnt a great deal about the nature of the various symmetry - broken states that arise in the pseudogap regime of the underdoped cuprates .",
    "this has largely been possible due to the enormous number of remarkable experiments performed on these materials .",
    "most of these experiments point toward the existence of a fluctuating and short - ranged charge - density wave in a metallic state ; the onset of the cdw happens below a characteristic scale @xmath255 , as deduced from x - ray scattering measurements @xcite .",
    "there is a considerable amount of evidence suggesting that the cdw competes with superconductivity .",
    "it is therefore essential to understand the true nature of the cdw and its relation to superconductivity , as this might be the key to gaining a complete understanding of the pseudogap phase out of which both orders emerge @xcite .",
    "theoretically , we have now started to realize that the cuprates are a model system where the fermi surface geometry , the strong interactions between the constituent electrons and the quasi - two dimensional structure conspire to give rise to some remarkable consequences .",
    "one of these is the universal feature that in the presence of strong antiferromagnetic interactions , superconductivity and charge - order are tied to each other ; this has been highlighted by the observation @xcite of the predicted @xcite @xmath1-wave form factor of the cdw . while sc and cdw necessarily arise as dual instabilites of the same normal state",
    ", they also compete with each other .",
    "one of the puzzling features , on the theoretical side , has been the discrepancy between the wavevector of the cdw seen experimentally and the one obtained from the leading cdw instabilities in various models .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper has been to address one interesting ingredient that could be partly responsible for resolving this discrepancy over at least an intermediate window of temperature .",
    "the primary motivation for invoking the effect of @xmath0wave superconducting fluctuations was to suppress density of states in the antinodal regions .    in this work",
    ", we studied the interplay of fluctuating charge - order and superconductivity .",
    "our starting point was the t - j model ( without gutzwiller projection ) for a metal interacting via short range antiferromagnetic exchange interactions , where the various instabilities at the hartree - fock level are to sc and cdws with different sets of wavevectors ( a t - j - v model with an infinite on - site hubbard u also leads to similar instabilites , in addition to a staggered flux state @xcite ) .",
    "the leading cdw - b state was found to have a wavevector of the form @xmath256 , while there was a sub - leading instability to the cdw - a with wavevectors @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "it is the latter that is closely related to the state seen in the experiments . in order to study the minimal model with all the necessary ingredients",
    ", we then considered the theory of a metal with pairing fluctuations and both types of cdw correlations and computed the effective ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory upto the quartic order in in the low - energy limit .",
    "we obtained a number of interesting results for the temperature dependencies of the coefficients in the gl theory .",
    "in particular , one of the central results of this paper is the nature of the competition between cdw - a and b with sc .",
    "we observed that sc competes with cdw - b much more strongly than with cdw - a at low enough , but non - zero temperatures . in the low - energy limit",
    ", we attributed this to the emergent su(2 ) symmetry between sc and cdw - b , which really does nt distinguish between the two different phases , and the absence of a gap in the spectrum at the antinodes . at low temperatures",
    ", we presented hints that the sc fluctuations might make it more favorable for cdw - a to arise and cdw - b to be suppressed preferentially .",
    "in fact , we showed that even in the presence of a finite fermi - surface curvature , the results for the mutual competition between cdw - a , b and sc continue to hold above a temperature scale that is set by the curvature @xmath257 .",
    "however at the same time , it is important to note that in the @xmath216 limit , cdw - a is related by su(2 ) symmetry to the pdw state with the same wavevectors and these two orders would therefore compete strongly with each other .",
    "however when the su(2 ) symmetry is broken explicitly by a finite fermi - surface curvature ( or by a nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion term ) , the fragile pdw state disappears completely , as witnessed in our hf computation for the t - j model . it would be interesting to explore the interplay between sc , cdw and pdw orders beyond weak - coupling , starting from a microscopic model in the near future",
    "finally , if it is indeed the superconducting flucutations that are responsible for giving rise to the experimentally observed wavevector , then it is possible that the cdw - b state would show up in experiments if one were to suppress these sc fluctuations completely .",
    "furthermore , the cdw - b order should have tendency to form checkerboard order , unlike cdw - a which has a tendency to form stripe - like order @xcite .",
    "this is a direction worth exploring in stm experiments at really high magnetic fields , for instance , and repeating phase - resolved analysis similar to what has been carried out recently to look for signatures of the cdw - a state @xcite .",
    "however , if the cdw - b state continues to be absent , then it is likely that there are other factors at play here in addition to the sc fluctuations .",
    "one such factor has already been considered recently , which arises from strong correlation effects due to coulomb repulsion @xcite .",
