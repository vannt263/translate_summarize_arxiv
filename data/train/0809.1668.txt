    "in [ 1 ] confirmed the membership of hd 115520 to the @xmath0 scuti class .",
    "it had been considered as a standard star in a 2005 observing run . from",
    "the relatively large scatter shown , [ 2 ] considered it to be variable candidate . with this in mind , new data were acquired in two new nights in 2006 which established it as a @xmath0 scuti star . in the present paper we present new observations which were performed in 2007 with the same instrumentation over a period of four nights and which have served to determine its periodic content .",
    "the frequencies found explain the behavior of both seasons separated by more than one year .",
    "these were taken at the observatorio astrnomico nacional , mxico using the 1.5 m telescope to which a spectrophotometer was attached .",
    "the observing season was carried out on four consecutive nights in march and april , 2007 .",
    "the following observing routine was employed : a multiple series of integrations was carried out , consisting of five 10 s integrations of the star to which one 10 s integration of the sky was subtracted .",
    "two reference stars were also observed c1 : hd116879 and c2 : hd114311 .",
    "these were observed in the following sequence to optimize the time coverage of the variable : v , sky , c1 , v , v , c2 , v. a series of standard stars was also observed at the beginning and at the end of each night to transform the data into the standard system .",
    "the strmgren system [ 3 ] is an intermediate band width system that overcomes many of the shortcomings of the @xmath1 system and provides astrophysically important information .",
    "the color indices in the strmgren system are very useful quantities . because both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 filters are relatively free from blanketing , the index @xmath4 is a good indicator of color and effective temperature .",
    "a color index is essentially the slope of the continuum . in the absence of blanketing",
    ", the continuum slope would be roughly constant and @xmath5 approximately equals @xmath6 . because @xmath6 is affected by blanketing , the difference between these two indices indicates the strength of blanketing .",
    "hence a metal index , @xmath7 , can be defined as    @xmath8    to determine how the continuum slope has been affected by the balmer discontinuity , the index @xmath9 is definde as    @xmath10    this index measures the balmer discontinuity , nearly free from the affects of line blanketing .",
    "the absolute photometric values of the 2007 campaign are provided in an archive .",
    "the accuracy of the season is deduced from the differences between the reduced and the previously reported values of the standard stars . due to the fact that the last night was of lower quality , and hence , less accurate , the mean values of the differences are calculated only from the standards of the first three nights .",
    "they are : 0.015 , 0.008 , 0.007 , 0.011 mag for v , @xmath5 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , respectively",
    ".    however , since the amplitude of the star is typical of a @xmath0 scuti star ( @xmath13 20 mmag , see figure 4 and in figure 2 of [ 1 ] ) , we preferred to analyze the data for the periodic content through differential photometry in the @xmath3 filter for which use was made of the reference stars c1 and c2 to increase the accuracy of the photometry to thousands of magnitude .",
    "a magnitude value of the reference stars was interpolated at the time of the variable and the final values , to which the average value of each night was subtracted .",
    "with the relatively few data points acquired in the 2006 season ( only two short nights ) we were able to demonstrate the star s variability and found evidence of at least two close frequencies which might explain the resulting beating behavior of the light curve . since the new photometric data is constituted of four long consecutive nights , we are now able to determine the pulsational frequencies with greater precision .",
    "two numerical packages were utilized : period04 [ 4 ] and iswf [ 5 ] . with period04",
    "the first run examined gave a frequency of 17.8643 c / d with an amplitude of 0.0140 mag in the frequency interval between 0 and 30 c / d with a step rate of 0.0150 .",
    "on the other hand , the iswf package yielded the following frequencies ( in c / d ) listed in diminishing amplitudes ( in parentheses , in mmag ) 17.850 ( 13.877 ) ; 14.7786 ( 10.334 ) ; 17.4527 ( 6.415 ) ; 13.5217 ( 4.236 ) and 18.1831 ( 3.973 ) .",
    "in the 2006 season we obtained 18.82 and 14.63 c / d .",
    "given the complex window function of observations on only two nights from only one observatory , we might consider them the same .",
    "on the other hand , when the whole set was utilized with a step rate of 0.00015 , period04 yielded peaks at 17.8373 and 14.7537 c / d , ( see figure 1 and table 1 ) .",
    "the rest of the frequencies might be disregarded because they do not significantly improve the residuals .",
    "their peaks are indistinguishable from each other due to the aliasing caused by the window function .",
    "therefore , we will consider as definitive only the first two frequencies listed in table 1 .",
    "figure 2 shows the light curves of the six observed nights .        [",
