    "it is becoming clear that in seyfert galaxies there is a close link between the seyfert nucleus , which may harbour a super - massive black - hole , and circumnuclear starburst activity .",
    "the nature of the connection is unclear , whether the starburst is somehow responsible for the formation or perhaps fuelling of a central black - hole , or whether activity associated with the central black - hole is responsible for triggering the star - formation . to understand the complexities of the central regions of active galaxies and the relationship between seyfert and starburst activity we need detailed multiwavelength studies of individual galaxies . in this paper",
    "we present such a study of the prominent spiral galaxy ngc1365 , concentrating on x - ray and radio data .",
    "ngc1365 is classified as a sbb(s)i type barred spiral galaxy by sandage & tammann ( 1981 ) , and is a member of the fornax cluster .",
    "ngc1365 is an active galaxy with an emission line nucleus ( with both broad and narrow h@xmath1 emission ) located at the edge of a dust - lane , which runs across the central bulge ( vron _ et al._1980 ) .",
    "we adopt a distance of 20mpc for ngc1365 throughout this paper .    the active nucleus of ngc1365 has been multiply classified .",
    "for instance , on the basis of the fwhm of the h@xmath1 component hjelm & lindblad ( 1996 ) classified ngc1365 as a seyfert 1.5 ( see also kristen _ et al._1997 ) .",
    "turner , urry & mushotzky ( 1993 ) classified it as a seyfert 2 , and maiolino & rieke ( 1995 ) as a seyfert  1.8 .",
    "in addition to the active nucleus , ngc1365 contains a large number of giant hii regions , with several of them in close proximity to the nucleus ( alloin _ et al._1981 ) .",
    "_ hst _ faint object camera observations of ngc1365 , discussed by kristen",
    "_ et al._(1997 ) , reveal numerous bright super star - clusters around the nucleus .",
    "these clusters are very compact , with radii estimated to be @xmath2pc , and tend to fall on an elongated ring around the nucleus .",
    "correlations between the locations of these super - star clusters and sources in this paper will be discussed later .",
    "hjelm & lindblad ( 1996 ) have also discussed optical observations of the central regions of ngc1365 , and in particular the conical region of high excitation gas associated with the nucleus .",
    "they describe a kinematical model of this region , whereby gas is accelerated in a bi - conical region , with the cone axes aligned with the galaxy rotation axis . the cone",
    "is also aligned with a suggested radio jet ( sandqvist , jrster & lindblad 1995 ) , though we shall discuss the nature of this jet in more detail later .",
    "radio observations of ngc1365 by saikia _",
    "et al._(1994 ) , sandqvist _",
    "et al._(1995 ) and forbes & norris ( 1998 ) reveal a complex , possibly ringlike structure around the nucleus , but with several radio hotspots loosely coincident with the giant hii regions .",
    "one of the nuclear hii regions ( region l4 in the terminology of alloin _",
    "et al._1981 ) shows a broad emission line at around 5696 , due to ciii emission ( phillips & conti 1992 ) . the strength of this line , and the absence of civ 5808  is indicative of the presence of between 350 and 1400 wc9 wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars .",
    "the presence of such a substantial population of massive wr stars is indicative of very recent ( @xmath3myr ) star - formation close to the nucleus .",
    "ngc1365 was not included in the original wr galaxy catalogue of conti ( 1991 ) , but was included in the subclass of wr barred spiral galaxies by contini , davoust & considre ( 1995 ) .",
    "we shall discuss the properties of ngc1365 in relation to wr galaxies in section  4.1 .",
    "the nuclear regions of ngc1365 were seen as a moderately strong ir source with _ iras _ ( ghosh _ et al._1993 ) .",
    "ngc1365 was also observed as a soft x - ray source by the  satellite , with an x - ray luminosity of @xmath4 ( for the @xmath5 waveband , corrected for distance ; fabbiano , kim & trinchieri 1992 ) .",
    "komossa & schulz ( 1998 ) have also recently presented a study of the x - ray properties of ngc1365 .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed analysis of radio and x - ray observations of ngc1365 in an attempt to better understand the puzzling central regions of this galaxy .",
    "the x - ray data probe the hot thermal gas from starburst emission and the hard non - thermal radiation from any massive compact object .",
    "radio observations on the other hand allows us to look for non - thermal emission from synchrotron radiation from snrs or an agn , or for thermal free - free emission from young stellar populations of hii regions .",
    "the combined x - ray / radio morphology will in turn allow us to to investigate the origin of the emission .",
    "ngc1365 has been observed on several occasions at x - ray energies .",
    "here we shall concentrate on observations with the  satellite ( both pspc and hri instruments ) , but also discuss recent results from the  satellite .",
    "these satellites and instruments have a range of complementary properties - the  pspc is very sensitive , has reasonable spectral resolution and reasonable spatial resolution ( @xmath6 ) , allowing us to probe the spectral properties of central regions and look for any extended emission ; the  hri is less sensitive and has essentially no spectral resolution , but has excellent spatial resolution ( @xmath7 ) allowing a detailed study of the x - ray morphology of ngc1365 .  on the other hand",
    "has poor spatial resolution ( a few arcminutes ) , but excellent spectral resolution , which coupled with a broader bandpass ( @xmath8 , as compared to @xmath9 for ) allows us to investigate the spectral properties of the integrated emission from ngc1365 in more detail . in particular ,  allows us to look for harder x - ray emission that might be associated with a seyfert nucleus .",
    "radio observations from the vla have been previously reported ( e.g.sandqvist _ et al._1995 ) .",
    "here we use the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) observations of forbes & norris ( 1998 ) which gives a more circular beam than the vla for a galaxy at dec .",
    "we report on observations at both 3 cm and 6 cm .",
    "some of the important issues that we intend to address in this paper are as follows :    1 .   what is the origin of the x - ray emission from ngc1365 ;",
    "i.e.is it associated with a massive central black - hole or is it due to starburst activity ?",
    "2 .   what is the origin of the radio hotspot emission ? 3 .   what is the energetic importance of the seyfert nucleus ? 4 .",
    "do we find any complimentary evidence for jets , winds , outflows or emission line cones at radio / x - ray frequencies ?",
    "the paper is organised as follows ; in section  2 we discuss the x - ray observations of ngc1365 with the  and  satellites , in section  3 we discuss the atca radio data , and in section  4 we discuss what the radio and x - ray data tell us about the nature of the central activity in ngc1365 .",

    "in all cases we create background subtracted images , and use the point source searching ( pss ) package ( allan 1993 ) to search for unresolved sources .",
    "et al._(1993 ) have discussed the point sources in the vicinity of ngc1365 detected with the  pspc and suggest some plausible candidates , namely x - ray binaries , hii regions in the spiral arms and possibly background agn ( see also komossa & schulz 1998 ) .",
    "several of the candidates are embedded in the disk of the galaxy and it is difficult to identify counterparts . because we have also detected diffuse x - ray emission there is also the possibility that some of the hri sources are merely spurious detections of irregularities in the diffuse emission .    for the  pspc observations we extracted source spectra for regions around ngc1365 and fitted them with simple spectral models .",
    "more details are given in the appropriate sections below .",
    "the @xmath11 bl  lac object 1e  0331.3 - 3629  is in the field of view of all the observations .",
    "this x - ray source was discovered by the  _ extended medium sensitivity survey_. the optical identification is discussed in maccacaro _",
    "et al._(1994 ) .",
    "the x - ray properties of 1e  0331.3 - 3629  are discussed in lamer , brunner & staubert ( 1996 ) .",
    "we have cross checked the position of 1e  0331.3 - 3629  with the apm catalogue ( irwin 1992 ) , and the optical position is well determined to arcsecond accuracy .",
    "we adopt a position of @xmath12 ( j2000 ) for 1e  0331.3 - 3629  ( c.f.maccacaro _ et al._1994 ) .",
    "consequently we can use the x - ray determined position of 1e  0331.3 - 3629  to accurately align the x - ray images .",
    "this is important as it enables us to accurately define the location of the x - ray emission in ngc1365 , and relate it to the radio emission , and hence understand its origin .",
    "ngc1365 has been observed with the  pspc on two occasions ( with an observation length of 2.6ksec for observation no.1 , and 6.2ksec for observation no.2 , with the observations separated by about 6 months ) .",
    "results from these observations have been reported by turner _",
    "et al._(1993 ) , who also reported on pspc observations of 5 other seyfert  2 galaxies .",
    "et al._(1993 ) found a total of 5 point sources near the nuclear source in ngc1365 , and found that the emission from the nuclear source was not well fitted by an absorbed power - law , but could be better fitted by either a model with a power - law , plus a raymond - smith thermal component ( with @xmath13 ) , or by a power - law with an emission line at an energy of @xmath14 .",
    "it is worth noting that the fit quality for the other seyfert galaxies , assuming a power - law model , was substantially better than for ngc1365 .",
    "we have reanalysed both  pspc observations .",
    "we extracted background subtracted spectral images for both observations .",
    "we adjusted the pointing of both observations using the bl  lac object 1e  0331.3 - 3629 .",
    "the x - ray image ( figure  [ figx1 ] ) shows moderately strong x - ray emission from ngc1365 ( the precise location will be discussed in section  4.2 ) as well as emission from other sources near the galaxy . the strong source to the sw of ngc1365 is 1e  0331.3 - 3629 .    in figure  [ figx2 ] , for the longer ( 6.2ksec ) observation",
    ", we show x - ray contours of the emission from ngc1365 superimposed on an optical image from the digitized sky survey .",
    "we also show in figure  [ figx2 ] the radial profile for the x - ray emission , compared to the point spread function ( psf ) for the pspc , for a spectrum with a mean photon energy of @xmath15 . the x - ray emission is clearly extended well beyond the psf of the  pspc . also , the extended emission is not azimuthally symmetric , with low surface brightness emission stretching preferentially along the bar of the galaxy .",
    "there is also point - like x - ray emission from the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "however , as we will discuss later in regard to the hri observations , this source , which is centred on the optical / radio nucleus , is not point - like , but is extended . also visible",
    "is a point source in the disk of the galaxy to the sw of the nucleus .",
    "this source is discussed in more detail in komossa & schulz ( 1998 ) .    in order to investigate the spectral properties of the x - ray emission",
    "we have extracted a spectrum from the region within 1.5  arcmin of the central point source for both pspc observations , and we fit them independently to look for any variability .",
    "we fit both spectra with two different spectral models , i ) an absorbed power - law and ii ) a single temperature raymond - smith plasma model .",
    "the details of the fits are given in table  [ tabx2 ] .",
    "we find that the power - law model gives a poor fit ( as was found by turner _",
    "et al._1993 ) , with reduced @xmath16 of 1.5 and 2 respectively for the two observations . on the other hand , for the raymond - smith plasma models we get good fits ( reduced @xmath17 ) , with @xmath18 , a low metallicity and a column ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the derived luminosities in the  waveband ( @xmath20 ) , corrected for absorption , are @xmath21 .",
    "adding in an absorbed power - law component to a thermal model ( as might be expected if we had a highly absorbed nuclear source ) does not lead to a better fit with the pspc ( c.f.section  2.3 ) .    for the absorbed thermal spectral model",
    ", there are some differences in the fitted parameters , mostly notably in the temperature .",
    "the differences are only significant at the @xmath22 level and may not reflect any physical changes .",
    "komossa & schulz ( 1998 ) also present results from an analysis of the  pspc observations of ngc1365 .",
    "they too note that a single temperature raymond - smith model provides a successful fit to the spectra . however , their preferred model is for a two component model , consisting of a raymond - smith model plus a powerlaw .",
    "the main reasons that komossa & schulz ( 1998 ) give for preferring the two component model is that the best - fit single temperature raymond - smith model has a low abundance ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "this low abundance is at odds with optical abundance determinations ( alloin _ et al._1981 ) however , we note that the work of strickland & stevens ( 1998 ) suggests fitting simple ( one or two component ) spectral models to intrinsically multi - temperature gas ( such as would be expected in a starburst ) can result in major errors in the fitted metallicity . consequently , the discrepancy between optical and x - ray determinations should perhaps not be taken too seriously .",
    "komossa & schulz ( 1998 ) also note that a raymond - smith plus power - law model is more in line with the  results of iyomoto _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 - see below ) . on the basis of our spectral fitting of the pspc spectra",
    "we find no statistical reason to prefer a two component model over our single temperature raymond - smith model .",
    "it is notable that the x - ray properties of ngc1365 , as observed by the pspc , are similar , in general terms , to those of starburst galaxies ( see section  4 ) , both in terms of showing extended emission and having an x - ray spectra better fit with a thermal model than a power - law . also , the fitted column density is very similar to the stark value ( @xmath24 , stark _ et al._1992 ) it is clear that we are not seeing a significant amount of emission in the pspc waveband from a heavily absorbed seyfert nucleus , however , the power - law component in such systems ( for example , ngc1386 , iyomoto _ et al._1997 ; ngc7582 , xue",
    "_ et al._1998 ) , associated with the nucleus , has a column @xmath25 , which means that it will not be detected in the pspc waveband .",
    "we also note that in the case of ngc1068 , a seyfert  2 galaxy , the power - law component in the x - ray spectrum has a low column ( ueno _ et al._1994 ) . in ngc1068",
    "the interpretation is that we are seeing scattered emission from the nucleus , rather than direct emission , the column being too high for it to be directly observed .",
    "we shall discuss the origin of the x - ray emission and the relation to the emission from other seyfert galaxies in section  4 .",

    "galaxy nucleus at @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the main points that can be distilled from these observations are as follows :    1 .",
    "the  pspc observations show extended x - ray emission from the central region of ngc1365 , with the emission preferentially extended along the bar of the galaxy .",
    "the pspc spectra can be well fitted with a thermal model with @xmath28 and a low absorbing column , comparable to the galactic stark value .",
    "the  hri observations show that the more concentrated central x - ray emission is still extended , with a radius of @xmath29 ( 1.5kpc ) , similar in extent to the radio ring .",
    "the centroid of the x - ray emission is consistent with the position of the radio / optical nucleus ( see section  4.2 ) .",
    "the  observations suggest that , in addition to the softer thermal emission , there is also a power - law component which is not highly absorbed .",
    "the  results also show strong fe - k emission , indicative of an active nucleus . 6 .",
    "the radio observations reveal a steep spectrum but the radio emission from the nucleus is less than that of the surrounding hotspots .",
    "the evidence for a radio jet is marginal .",
    "having estimated the total x - ray emission from ngc1365 ( i.e.@xmath30 erg s@xmath31 in the @xmath20 energy band ) we can compare its x - ray properties to those of other spiral , starburst and seyfert galaxies .",
    "its total blue luminosity is @xmath32 and the iras far - infrared flux between @xmath33 m and @xmath34 m , using the expression in helou",
    "_ et al._(1988 ) , gives a luminosity of @xmath35 .",
    "assuming the conversion of hunter _",
    "et al._(1986 ) this corresponds to a star formation rate for stars with masses @xmath36 of about @xmath37 .    from the relationship between @xmath38 and @xmath39 for starburst galaxies in david , jones & forman ( 1992 ) , and using the fir luminosity of ngc1365 we can estimate the fraction of the x - ray luminosity that we might expect from the starburst component . on this basis ,",
    "the david _ et al._(1992 ) relationship would predict a soft x - ray luminosity of @xmath40 , comparable to the luminosity in the  pspc waveband ( table  [ tabx2 ] , see also turner _",
    "et al._1997 ) .",
    "we can also compare the values of @xmath38 , @xmath41 and @xmath39 for ngc1365 with those for the sample of nearby spirals and starburst galaxies in read , ponman & strickland ( 1997 ) .",
    "we find that ngc1365 lies roughly on the @xmath42 correlation found by read _",
    "et al._(1997 ) , though ngc1365 is more x - ray luminous than any galaxy in the sample of read _",
    "et al._(1997 ) .",
    "these facts suggest that the bulk of the soft x - ray emission is due to starburst activity .",
    "an interesting comparison can also be made between the properties of ngc1365 and those of wr galaxies in the survey of stevens & strickland ( 1998 ) .",
    "wr galaxies are believed to be young starbursts , and we note that ngc1365 can be regarded as a wr galaxy on account of the wr feature in one of the hii regions in the central regions ( region l4 ) .",
    "however , it is unlike many of the other wr galaxies in the sample of stevens & strickland ( 1998 ) , which often are dwarf galaxies .",
    "et al._(1995 ) included ngc1365 in their sample of barred spiral wr galaxies - all of which seem to have a high inclination .",
    "et al._(1995 ) suggested that starburst winds may play a role in removing absorbing material perpendicular to the galaxy disk , making the wr feature more likely to be observed .",
    "the x - ray spectra from the nuclear regions of ngc1365 shows very little local absorption , which may provide some support for this idea . in terms of the @xmath42 relationship , ngc1365 lies rather below the trend for wr galaxies found by stevens & strickland ( 1998 ) .",
    "however , the spectrum of ngc1365 is very similar to those of wr galaxies .",
    "the fact that ngc1365 is also a wr galaxy strengthens the contention that the soft x - ray emission from ngc1365 is mostly due to starburst emission .",
    "the relationship between radio and far - infrared luminosity extends over many orders of magnitude and includes normal spirals , starburst galaxies and radio - quiet seyfert galaxies ( e.g.wunderlich , wielebinski & klein 1987 ) . in the case of",
    "ngc1365 the far - infrared to radio lies between the typical values for normal and starburst galaxies ( helou _",
    "et al._1985 ) further indicating that the bulk of the far - infrared and radio emission is associated with star formation processes rather than any agn .",
    "the brackett@xmath43 emission has been used as a predictor of x - ray emission from starbursts ( ward 1988 ) . in this model",
    "all of the predicted x - ray emission from the starburst comes from massive x - ray binaries ( mxrbs ) , which are formed from the binary evolution of massive stars .",
    "the brackett@xmath43 emission is a consequence of recombination following ionization by the same set of massive stars formed in the starburst .",
    "the predicted relationship between @xmath38 ( for soft x - rays ) and @xmath44 is :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the mean x - ray luminosity per massive x - ray binary ( which we assume to be @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 is the number of mxrbs per o - star .",
    "we assume @xmath49 ( fabbiano _ et al._1982 ) .",
    "this relationship clearly does not take into account x - ray emission from superbubbles or snrs or an agn .    from forbes & ward ( 1993 )",
    "we calculate that the brackett@xmath43 luminosity in the central @xmath50 is @xmath51 , which in turn implies a total number of o - stars of around @xmath52 , and an @xmath53 .",
    "this is only a factor of 3 or so below our preferred thermal model estimate for @xmath38 of the whole galaxy , suggesting that the contribution of an agn to the low energy x - ray emission from ngc1365 may be small .",
    "the main caveat here is that mxrbs in our own galaxy have much harder spectra ( typically a powerlaw with a high energy cut - off - nagase 1989 ) than that observed from ngc1365 .",
    "it is possible that the power - law in the  observations could be a consequence of these mxrbs .",
    "however , the line emission could not be generated by a population of mxrbs .",
    "as noted earlier we can use the optical position of the bl  lac object 1e  0331.3 - 3629  to register the x - ray images , which in turns enables us to determine the centroids of the x - ray emission from the central regions of ngc1365 .    in table",
    "[ tabx3 ] we list the positions of the centroids of the x - ray central source as determined by the pss program , for all the observations .",
    "there is some scatter between the x - ray determined positions , but this is @xmath54 , indicating good consistency between the results for the different  observations .",
    "the positions of the radio and optical nucleus are also listed in table  [ tabx3 ] .",
    "the mean centroid of the x - ray emission is consistent with the position of the optical / radio nucleus .",
    "this might suggest that we are seeing emission from a massive compact object in the nucleus .",
    "there are several arguments against this ; first , the hri observations ( fig .  [ figx4 ] ) show that the central x - ray emission is extended and not point - like , with an extent comparable to the radio ring ( and the x - ray emission is also centred on the radio ring ) .",
    "second , the x - ray spectral properties as seen with , are consistent with thermal radiation , but not with power - law emission expected from a compact object , although as the  results of iyomoto _",
    "et al._(1997 ) show there is emission at higher energies from an active nucleus . also ,",
    "a peak in the x - ray emission peaks coincident with the position of the optical / radio nucleus is seen in other nuclear starbursts ( c.f.ptak _ et al._1998 ) .",
    "consequently , the x - ray emission is centred on the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "this does not mean that the x - ray emission is dominated by a central point source , as the  observations suggest that at soft x - ray energies the emission is dominated by a nuclear starburst . while there appears to be emission associated with an active nucleus at higher energies",
    "its contribution at soft x - ray energies is small compared to the hot thermal emission .",
    "_ axaf _ , with its @xmath55 spatial resolution , will provide a much clearer view of the complex morphology in the heart of ngc1365 .",
    "the spectral indices of the radio hotspots imply a non - thermal origin . the spatial morphology - a ring around the nucleus - tells us that a compact object is not responsible for the vast majority of the radio emission .",
    "supernovae or snrs are the obvious candidates for the hotspot emission with synchrotron emission from shock accelerated electrons the most likely emission mechanism .",
    "if the typical radio luminosity of a snr is @xmath56 and in the central @xmath50 of ngc1365 we have @xmath57 erg s@xmath31 , this would imply 23,000 snrs .",
    "however , the emission from young radio supernovae can be much more luminous than this ( i.e.sn1988z ; van dyk _",
    "et al._1993 ) , and these radio supernovaecould be responsible for much of the emission from one or other of the radio hotspots .",
    "further to this , some radio supernovae  have also been detected as bright x - ray sources ( for instance , fabian & terlevich ( 1996 ) found that sn1988z has an x - ray luminosity in the waveband of @xmath58 , brighter or comparable in luminosity to many starburst galaxies ) .",
    "indeed we can correlate the positions of the hii regions near the centre of ngc1365 ( alloin _ et al._1981 ) with the radio hotspots .",
    "the hii region l3 and radio hotspot  a seem to be connected , as do l12 and hotspot  e. kristen _",
    "et al._(1997 ) , reporting on _ hst _ observations of ngc1365 , find a positional coincidence between a super star cluster and radio hotspot a. on this basis , and the probable strong h@xmath1 emission from this cluster , suggest that the radio emission from hotspot a is due to a radio supernova .",
    "it is instructive to compare @xmath59 ratios for different objects .",
    "sgr a@xmath60 , the black hole at the centre of our galaxy , has a soft x - ray luminosity of @xmath61 ( predehl & trmper 1994 ) and a 6 cm luminosity of @xmath62 ( marcaide _ et al._1992 ) for an assumed distance of 8.5kpc .",
    "so the @xmath59 ratio is 10 .",
    "cas a , the brightest snr in our galaxy , has an @xmath59 ratio of @xmath63 75 . for radio supernovae",
    "the ratio can be higher still ( @xmath64 several hundred ) for sn1988z and sn1978k .    because of the complex extended nature of the emission , and the limitations of the x - ray instruments it is a difficult to accurately estimate the x - ray flux from within @xmath50 .",
    "we estimate a value of @xmath65 .",
    "for ngc1365 we have @xmath66 , which implies a ratio of @xmath67 within a radius of @xmath50 .",
    "this value is rather large and could suggest that an agn is not the dominant energetic factor in the central regions of ngc1365 , and is more in line with that seen for radio supernovae . of relevance is the fact that the @xmath59 ratio for ngc1068 is also in the range @xmath68 ( see condon _",
    "et al._1982 for larger aperture radio observations of ngc1068 ) .",
    "for both ngc1365 and ngc1068 the emission from the nucleus ( as identified at higher resolution ) is much less than the emission from within a radio of @xmath50 ( see table  [ tabx4 ] and muxlow _",
    "et al._1996 ) .",
    "we also note that large values of @xmath59 are possible in radio quiet qsos ( c.f.mas-hesse _ et al._1995 ) .",
    "there are perhaps three main possible explanations for the extended x - ray emission seen in ngc1365 ; first , scattering of nuclear radiation by photoionized material , second , a large number of unresolved point sources , and third , genuinely extended x - ray emission from a hot plasma .",
    "extended x - ray emission has also been found in the seyfert  2 galaxy ngc4388 by matt _",
    "et al._(1994 ) , using results from the  hri .",
    "results from pspc observations of ngc4388 have been reported on in antonelli , matt & piro ( 1997 ) .",
    "these authors discussed the possibility that a luminous nuclear source ( i.e.a supermassive black - hole ) photoionizes a large region around it , but is obscured from direct view by a dense torus .",
    "radiation escaping perpendicular to the torus is scattered into the line - of - sight by electrons from the photoionized plasma .",
    "et al._(1994 ) discounted this idea largely on the basis of the observed spectral properties of ngc4388 .    in ngc1365 , the  observations suggest the presence of a scattered component , which might well be associated with a luminous nucleus obscured from direct view",
    ". this scattered power - law component can not be responsible for the bulk of the soft emission seen in the waveband for the following reasons .",
    "first , the x - ray emission as seen by the  pspc is very extended ( 8kpc ) , which would imply an extremely luminous ionizing source , and second , and perhaps most telling , is that the observed thermal spectrum , is too soft to result from the scattering of a agn continuum .",
    "populations of stellar sources distributed throughout the bar of ngc1365 could mimic the extended nature of the emission by such an ensemble .",
    "these objects could be x - ray binaries ( both high and low mass ) , normal stars ( again both high or low mass ) or supernova remnants .",
    "both high mass and low mass x - ray binaries have harder spectra than the @xmath69 thermal spectrum observed in ngc1365 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of ngc1365 is rather high for a typical spiral ( but not excessively so )",
    ". a model whereby a reasonably large number of mxrbs were emitting could be plausible .",
    "we note that mxrbs are descendants of high mass stars and will be formed in starburst events , and so this model is not completely distinct from models associated with starbursts .    as noted in section  4.1 , the brackett@xmath43 emission can be used to estimate the number of o - stars and x - ray binaries . for ngc1365",
    "the number of x - ray binaries is of order 200 .",
    "if these 200 binaries were uniformly distributed in a disk of radius 8kpc then the mean separation would be significantly below that of the  pspc but comparable to that of the hri .",
    "we see from both pspc and hri observations that the emission from the extended component is clearly concentrated towards the central region .",
    "consequently such a model with @xmath70 luminous mxrbs distributed through the bar of the galaxy could account for the spatial properties seen in ngc1365 . as we have noted before the x - ray spectral properties would suggest that mxrbs were not the dominant source of emission .",
    "an origin associated with early - type stars can be quickly dismissed - these typically have @xmath71 , implying too low a level of x - ray emission . while magnetically active low - mass stars can have higher @xmath72 ,",
    "such a large population of young active stars would be implausible .",
    "individual snr can have x - ray luminosities of @xmath73 , and x - ray temperatures of the right magnitude ( schlegel 1995 ) .",
    "young ( @xmath74 yr ) radio supernovae  can have x - ray luminosities higher luminosities ( @xmath75 or more ) , but these luminosities are short lived . a situation where we have a large number of snr ( @xmath76 )",
    "could give rise to observed the x - ray luminosity .",
    "however , for any reasonable estimate of time - scale for substantial x - ray emission to persist from an individual snrs ( a few @xmath77 years ) this would imply a very high sn rate , at odds with observations at other wavelengths .",
    "the sn rate in the central @xmath50 , as inferred from the radio observations , is 0.02 sn / yr , and 0.03 sn / yr , as inferred from [ feii ] emission ( forbes & norris 1998 ) .",
    "we can probably rule out a snr origin for all of the x - ray emission by reference to the radio observations , which imply a much smaller number of snrs . however",
    ", as we shall discuss below , a starburst origin of the x - ray emission would still imply a contribution from supernovae , but in this case the hot gas from a starburst will have been built up over a long period of time .",
    "we note that there have been two historical supernova in ngc1365 ; sn1957c , to the n of the nucleus and the type ic sn1983v , about 1 arcmin to the sw of the nucleus ( clocchiatti _ et al._1997 ) .",
    "neither sn are coincident with any x - ray or radio source .",
    "the most plausible physical origin for extended hot gas in the disk of ngc1365 is from a starburst . here a burst of star - formation results in the production of large numbers of massive ob stars , which via their stellar winds and subsequent supernova inflate x - ray emitting superbubbles , which will eventually merge and blow - out to form a superwind , such as seen in m82 ( strickland , ponman & stevens 1997 , moran & lehnert 1997 ) .    the simple analysis concerning the brackett@xmath43 emission suggests the presence of around @xmath52 o9 stars ( or their equivalent ) .",
    "the mass - loss rate of such a star is @xmath78 and the wind kinetic energy is of order @xmath79 , so the total kinetic energy from such a cluster of stars ( assuming they are all concentrated towards the centre of the galaxy ) will be @xmath80 .",
    "as only a fraction of the kinetic energy of the stellar winds can be converted into x - ray emission such an assembly of stars would not , by themselves , be able to power the x - ray emission from ngc1365 .",
    "however , this analysis does not account for the contribution from snrs and x - ray binaries , and the hot stars could make a significant contribution to the x - ray emission via their stellar winds .      in order to understand the radio / x - ray properties of ngc1365 we now briefly discuss similar observations of related galaxies .",
    "et al._(1993 ) , in addition to presenting results on ngc1365 , also presented  pspc results on several seyfert  2 galaxies . of note",
    "is that it was not possible to obtain a good fit with a power - law model for ngc1365 , while much better fits were obtained for the other galaxies in the sample .",
    "also , the other galaxies were typically an order of magnitude more x - ray luminous than ngc1365 , and were much more overluminous compared to their blue luminosity .",
    "this would suggest that ngc1365 is not a typical seyfert  2 , but as we shall see in the discussion below , there are some striking similarities between the x - ray properties of ngc1365 and some other galaxies classified as seyfert  2 s .",
    "awaki ( 1997 ) reviews the x - ray properties of seyfert  2s , finding an extremely wide range of luminosities , with some galaxies having luminosities of @xmath81 , while others have @xmath82 .",
    "the radio emission from seyfert  2s may cover an even larger range of @xmath83 orders of magnitude ( see for example simpson _",
    "et al._1996 ) .",
    "et al._(1992 ) have reported on  hri observations of the canonical seyfert  2 galaxy ngc1068 .",
    "these observations revealed a compact nuclear source , circumnuclear emission ( with a diameter of 1.5kpc ) and much more extended emission ( diameter 13kpc ) associated with the starburst disk .",
    "et al._(1992 ) concluded that the nuclear and circumnuclear x - ray emission were from thermal gas associated with an outflowing wind .",
    "higher spectral resolution x - ray observations of ngc1068 with both _ bbxrt _ and  ( marshall _ et al._1993 ; ueno _",
    "et al._1994 ) found strong line emission from a range of different species , including strong fe - k emission .",
    "in addition , the x - ray continuum could be fitted with a model with two soft thermal components ( with one component with @xmath84 and a 2nd component with @xmath85 ) and a power - law component , with a photon index of @xmath86 .",
    "importantly , the power - law component does not appear to be highly absorbed . according to marshall _ et al._(1993 )",
    "the 2 - 10luminosity of ngc1068 ( dominated by the power - law component ) is @xmath87 , approximately an order of magnitude brighter than the powerlaw component for ngc1365 ( iyomoto _ et al._1997 ) .",
    "marshall _ et al._(1993 ) and ueno _",
    "et al._(1994 ) developed a model for ngc1068 whereby the x - ray emission is due to both starburst emission and scattered emission from a much more luminous ( possibly @xmath88 ) active nucleus . in this picture we see no direct x - ray emission from the active nucleus ( it being obscured by material with an extremely high column ) , only emission scattered into the line of sight by both warm and hot absorbing material .",
    "it is worth noting that at radio wavelengths the nucleus of ngc1068 is much brighter than ngc1365 ( muxlow _ et al._1996 ) .",
    "the source that muxlow _ et al._(1996 ) identify with the nucleus of ngc1068 in addition to having an inverted spectrum , is well over an order of magnitude brighter than the source identified with the nucleus in ngc1365 . with larger apertures",
    "ngc1068 is still much brighter at radio wavelengths than ngc1365 ( c.f.section 4.3 ; condon _ et al._1982 ) . on spatial scales of several arcseconds",
    "the radio emission is dominated by starburst / snr emission , with only a small contribution from the nucleus .",
    "matt _ et al._(1994 ) have reported on  hri observations of ngc4388 , a highly inclined spiral galaxy ( sb(s)b pec ) near the core of the virgo cluster , finding extended emission with a radius of 4.5kpc .",
    "et al._(1994 ) did not find any evidence of a central source , constraining the emission from such a point source to less than 20% of the total .",
    "ngc4388 also shows weak broad h@xmath1 emission in extended off nuclear regions ( shields & filippenko 1988 ) , which has been interpreted as being due to scattered light from an obscured nucleus ( as per the standard unified model of seyfert  2 nuclei ) .",
    "ngc4388 also has two extended and asymmetric ionization cones .",
    "et al._(1997 ) have also studied the x - ray properties of ngc4388 including  observations .",
    "the observations reveal the presence of a strong and highly absorbed ( @xmath89 ) power - law component coming from the nucleus , along with narrow fe line emission at @xmath90 ( though this emission line has a large equivalent width ( ew@xmath91ev - iwasawa _ et al._1997 ) .",
    "brandt , halpern & iwasawa ( 1996 ) have reported on  pspc and hri observations of the composite starburst / seyfert  2 ngc1672 ( sb(s)b ) .",
    "of three x - ray sources associated with ngc1672 , the nuclear source ( x-1 ) has an unabsorbed luminosity of @xmath92 in the waveband , @xmath93 and a low absorbing column ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of ngc1672 is somewhat lower than for ngc1365 , but otherwise the x - ray properties are remarkably comparable .",
    "ngc1672 also shows a compact radio source located at the optical nucleus , with an almost circular ring of emission , as seen in ngc1365 ( sandqvist _ et al._1995 ) .",
    "consequently , ngc1672 may indeed be very similar to ngc1365 , and the seyfert nucleus may also not play a dominant role in this galaxy .      as noted in the introduction , ngc1365 has been classified as a galaxy with a seyfert nucleus on the basis of both broad and narrow h@xmath1 emission . on the basis of the  data there is no real evidence at soft x - ray energies of a seyfert type nucleus in ngc1365 .",
    "however , the  data does suggest the presence of an active nucleus .",
    "we suggest that the active nucleus in ngc1365 is a low - luminosity analogue of that in ngc1068 , with a luminosity of 5 - 10% of that in ngc1068 .",
    "so that , while in ngc1068 it has been suggested that the agn perhaps provides approximately 50% of the bolometric luminosity ( telesco _ et al._1984 ) .",
    "we suggest that in ngc1365 the fraction provided by the agn will be correspondingly smaller .",
    "there is also evidence of something resembling an active nucleus at radio wavelengths , but whether it is strong enough to warrant ngc1365 being classified as a seyfert nucleus is questionable . at optical wavelengths ,",
    "there is some evidence of agn related activity - with an outflow cone seen in [ oiii ] @xmath95 , though an outflow like this could be generated by starburst activity . as to the broad h@xmath1 emission",
    "- could the radio supernova associated with radio hotspot a be responsible for this ?",
    "recently , when discussing massive black holes in galaxies it has been become popular to suggest that many black holes are not accreting at the eddington rate but rather the much reduced rate associated with an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; narayan 1996 ) .",
    "we consider the presence of an adaf in ngc1365 to be unlikely , on the basis of both the radio and x - ray spectra .",
    "such adafs predict a slightly positive spectral index at radio wavelengths .",
    "we find that the 6/3 cm index is quite steep at @xmath96 , and we do not see much evidence for a very hot bremsstrahlung spectrum from the nucleus ( though this component could possibly be mistaken for the observed power - law component ) , though its absence would have to be confirmed by _",
    "an unobscured adaf would also not produce strong fe - k line emission ( narayan 1996 ) .",
    "ngc1365 is a highly inclined system , with @xmath97 , so that , in a more speculative vein , we could be looking down onto a superwind , such as seen in m82 .",
    "neither the x - ray temperature nor luminosity are unreasonable for such a model , and this idea merits further investigation .",
    "as mentioned earlier , an outflow cone has been observed in this galaxy , though it was thought to be related more to agn activity .    in summary ,",
    "we have presented radio and x - ray observations of the prominent barred spiral ngc1365 . on the basis of soft x - ray and radio observations we find little if any evidence of an agn , but much more evidence for strong star - forming activity . however",
    ", strong fe - k emission does suggest an active nucleus .",
    "comparison with other seyfert galaxies , such as ngc1068 , suggest that any agn in ngc1365 is not energetically dominant at most wavelengths .",
    "consequently , we suggest that the active nucleus in ngc1365 is a low luminosity analogue of the nucleus in ngc1068 . even in the nucleus of ngc1365 , agn activity is accompanied by very significant starburst emission , and outside of the nuclear region starburst activity completely dominates .",
