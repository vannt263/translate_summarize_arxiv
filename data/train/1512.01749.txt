    "the multiple descriptions ( md ) problem was proposed in the late seventies and has been studied extensively since , yielding a series of advances , ranging from the derivation of asymptotic bounds @xcite to practical approaches for multiple descriptions quantizer design @xcite .",
    "it was originally viewed as a method to cope with channel failures , where multiple source descriptions are generated and sent over different paths .",
    "the encoder generates @xmath2 descriptions for transmission over @xmath2 available channels .",
    "it is assumed that the decoder receives a subset of the descriptions perfectly and the remaining are lost , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : basic_md ] .",
    "the objective of the md problem is to design the encoders ( for each description ) and decoders ( for each possible received subset of the descriptions ) , with respect to an overall rate - distortion ( rd ) trade - off .",
    "the subtlety of the problem is due to the balance between the full reconstruction quality versus quality of individual descriptions ; or noise free quality versus the amount of redundancy across descriptions needed to achieve resilience to descriptions loss .",
    "channel multiple descriptions setup : each description is received error free or is completely lost at the decoder[fig : basic_md ] ]    one of the first achievable regions for the 2-channel md problem was derived by el - gamal and cover ( ec ) in 1982 @xcite .",
    "it follows from ozarow s results in @xcite that the ec region is complete for the 2-channel quadratic gaussian md problem , i.e. , when the source is gaussian and the distortion measure is mean squared error ( mse ) .",
    "it was further shown by ahlswede in @xcite that the ec region is complete for a cross - section of the 2-description md setup , called the ` no - excess rate regime ' , a scenario wherein the central decoder receives information at the minimum sum rate .",
    "this led to the popular belief that the ec achievable region is complete for the general 2-channel md problem .",
    "however zhang and berger ( zb ) in @xcite proved a then surprising result , that the ec scheme is strictly sub - optimal in general .",
    "in particular , they showed that for a binary source under hamming distortion , sending a common codeword in both descriptions can achieve points that are strictly outside the ec region .",
    "while introducing a common codeword implies explicit redundancy among the two descriptions , this codeword assists in better coordination between the descriptions leading to a strictly larger rd region .",
    "several researchers have since focused on extending ec and zb to the @xmath0channel md problem @xcite .",
    "an achievable scheme , due to venkataramani , kramer and goyal ( vgk ) @xcite , directly builds on ec and zb , and introduces a combinatorial number of refinement codebooks , one for each subset of the descriptions .",
    "motivated by zb , a _",
    "common codeword is also shared by all the descriptions , which assists in better coordination of the messages , improving the rd trade - off . for the @xmath0channel quadratic gaussian problem ,",
    "it was shown by wang and viswanath in @xcite that a special case of the vkg coding scheme , where no common codeword is sent , achieves the minimum sum rate when only the individual and the central distortion constraints are imposed .",
    "in particular , they showed that a ` correlated quantization ' based encoding scheme , which is an extension of the ozarow s encoding mechanism to the @xmath2-descriptions problem , achieves the minimum sum rate for the cross - section involving constraints only on the individual and central distortions .",
    "it was also shown recently by chen in @xcite that , in fact , this approach leads to the complete region for this particular cross - section .",
    "pradhan , puri and ramachandran ( ppr ) considered a practically interesting cross - section of the general @xmath0channel md problem in @xcite called the ` symmetric md problem ' wherein it is assumed that the rates of all the descriptions are equal and the distortion is a function only of the ` number ' of descriptions received rather than which particular subset is received .",
    "they proposed a new coding scheme leveraging principles from distributed source coding @xcite , and particularly slepian and wolf s random binning techniques , and showed that , for this symmetric cross - section , the proposed encoding scheme improves upon the vkg region .",
    "tian and chen derived a new coding scheme in @xcite for the symmetric md problem which further extends the ppr region .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that this region is very close to complete for the symmetric quadratic gaussian md problem .",
    "recently , wang and viswanath @xcite derived a coding scheme based on the vkg and the ppr encoding principles and showed its sum - rate optimality for certain cross - sections of the quadratic gaussian problem wherein only 2 layers of distortions are imposed . moreover , in @xcite , song et.al . showed that , for the quadratic gaussian setting , when the minimum sum rate is attained subject to two levels of distortion constraints ( with the second level imposed on the complete set of descriptions ) , the ppr scheme also leads to the minimum achievable distortion at the intermediate levels .",
    "in this paper we present a new encoding scheme involving `` combinatorial message sharing '' ( cms ) , where a unique common codeword is sent in ( shared by ) each subset of the descriptions , thereby introducing a combinatorial number of _ shared codebooks _",
    ", along with the refinement codebooks of @xcite .",
    "the common codewords enable better coordination between descriptions , providing an improved overall rd region .",
    "we derive an achievable region for cms and show that it subsumes vkg for general sources and distortion measures .",
    "moreover , we show that cms achieves a strictly larger region than vkg for all @xmath3 , if there exists a 2-description subset for which zb achieves points strictly outside the ec region .",
    "in particular , cms achieves strict improvement for a binary source under hamming distortion .",
    "we then show a surprising result : cms strictly outperforms vkg for a general class of sources and distortion measures , which includes several scenarios in which , for every 2-description subset , the zb and the ec regions coincide .",
    "in particular , we show that for a gaussian source under mse , cms achieves points strictly outside the vkg region .",
    "this result is in striking contract to the corresponding 2-descriptions setting .",
    "optimality of ec for the 2-descriptions setup has led to a natural conjecture that common codewords do not play a necessary role in quadratic gaussian md coding , and all the achievable regions characterized so far neglect the common layer ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this paper , we show that the common codewords in cms play a critical role in achieving the complete rd region for several asymmetric cross - sections of the general @xmath0channel quadratic gaussian md problem .",
    "we note that the principles underlying cms have been shown in precursor work to be useful in related applicational contexts of routing for networks with correlated sources @xcite and data storage for selective retrieval @xcite .",
    "we further note that a preliminary version of the results in this paper appeared in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also note that , in this paper , we focus on generalizing the vkg coding scheme using a combinatorial number of shared messages for the md problem with general sources and distortion measures .",
    "however , the cms principle can be extended to incorporate random binning based encoding techniques , to utilize the underlying symmetry in the problem setup .",
    "preliminary results in this direction have recently appeared in @xcite and form part of our current research focus .",
    "the cms scheme introduces a structured mechanism for generating random codebooks that lead to controlled redundancy across transmitted messages .",
    "the cms scheme is only one of the several possible generalizations of the zb scheme to @xmath2-descriptions .",
    "the fundamental idea of introducing structured codes and controlled redundancy for @xmath0channel multiple descriptions problem is not new and has been explored in several publications in the past , including @xcite and some of these schemes have been shown to outperform vkg for certain sources and distortion measures .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , for a gaussian source , under mse , cms is the only generalization of the vkg scheme that achieves a strictly larger rate - distortion region .",
    "there are other encoding schemes that can achieve points strictly outside the vkg region , such as the ppr scheme , but are not strict generalizations vkg in the sense that their achievable region has not been shown to always subsume the entire vkg rate - distortion region .",
    "hence there are fundamentally new insights to be gained by studying cms .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : prior_results ] , we formally state the @xmath0channel md setup and briefly describe the approaches and regions of ec @xcite , zb @xcite and vkg @xcite . to keep the notation simple , we first describe in section [ sub:3-descriptions - scenario ] , the cms scheme for the 3 descriptions scenario and extend it to the general case in section [ sub : l - channel - case ] .",
    "we then prove in section [ sec : strict - improvement1 ] that cms achieves strict improvement over vkg whenever there exists a 2-description subset for which zb achieves points outside the ec region . in section [ sec : strict - improvement2 ] we prove that cms outperforms vkg for a fairly general class of source - distortion measure pairs , including a gaussian source under mse . finally in section [ sec : gaussian - mse - setting ] , we derive new results for the @xmath0channel quadratic gaussian md setup and show that cms achieves the complete rd region for several asymmetric cross - sections of the general problem .",

    "<S> this paper presents a new achievable rate - distortion region for the general l channel multiple descriptions problem . </S>",
    "<S> a well known general region for this problem is due to venkataramani , kramer and goyal ( vkg ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their encoding scheme is an extension of the el - gamal - cover ( ec ) and zhang - berger ( zb ) coding schemes to the l channel case and includes a combinatorial number of refinement codebooks , one for each subset of the descriptions . as in zb </S>",
    "<S> , the scheme also allows for a single common codeword to be shared by all descriptions . </S>",
    "<S> this paper proposes a novel encoding technique involving ` combinatorial message sharing ' ( cms ) , where every subset of the descriptions may share a distinct common message . </S>",
    "<S> this introduces a combinatorial number of shared codebooks along with the refinement codebooks of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these shared codebooks provide a more flexible framework to trade - off redundancy across the messages for resilience to descriptions loss . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an achievable rate - distortion region for the proposed technique , and show that it subsumes the vkg region for general sources and distortion measures . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that cms provides a strict improvement of the achievable region for any source and distortion measures for which some 2-description subset is such that zb achieves points outside the ec region . </S>",
    "<S> we then show a more surprising result : cms outperforms vkg for a general class of sources and distortion measures , including scenarios where the zb and ec regions coincide for all 2-description subsets . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that cms strictly improves on vkg , for the @xmath0channel quadratic gaussian md problem , for all @xmath1 , despite the fact that the ec region is complete for the corresponding 2-descriptions problem . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the ` correlated quantization ' scheme ( an extreme special case of vkg ) , that has been proven to be optimal for several cross - sections of the @xmath0channel quadratic gaussian md problem , is strictly suboptimal in general . using the encoding principles derived , </S>",
