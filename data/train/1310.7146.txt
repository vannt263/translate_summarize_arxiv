    "direct evidence for spiral wave triggering of star formation has been difficult to find since density wave shocks were first identified by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "@xcite studied embedded star formation on 500 pc scales in the _ spitzer_-based sings survey by comparing @xmath7 m emission with h@xmath1 .",
    "they found a median extinction of 1.4 mag in h@xmath1 , and that 4% of the @xmath7 m sources have h@xmath1 extinctions larger than 3 mag .",

    "the 2mass data is used in our application of a technique proposed by @xcite to estimate the underlying old stellar population .",

    "mentuch et al .",
    "then showed that the excess @xmath0 m emission above half the @xmath23 m emission correlates with h@xmath1 .",

    ". sometimes part of a @xmath0 m source is visible at @xmath17 inside the circles , but the measuring rectangle was made on the part of the @xmath0 m source that was not visible at @xmath17 or at any other sdss filter .",
    "measurement rectangles are typically several arcseconds in length and width .",
    "the identified sources appear to be embedded star - forming regions in the spiral arm dust lanes .",
    "they are visible at @xmath10 m because the extinction there is only @xmath27% of the @xmath17-band extinction @xcite .",
    "they are often visible in h@xmath1 too , which is strange because that is an optical band , but h@xmath1 emission can sometimes be more easily detected than optical starlight , and some of the h@xmath1 could be from regions that are between and around the densest parts of the obscuring clouds .",
    "higher resolution hst images show parts of these sources to be visible at optical bands , but the hst optical fluxes are still weak compared to the @xmath0 m fluxes because of a generally high obscuration .    the origin of the @xmath0 m emission is understood only in general terms .",
    "some of it is from the rayleigh - jeans limit of the photospheric emission from young and old stars , some of it is from hot dust in young stellar disks and dense cores , and some is from pah emission associated with the hii regions .",
    "we assume that the pah part of the @xmath0 m emission is an independent measure of flux from the hii region . after subtracting the contribution from underlying stars @xcite",
    ", we can then determine the embedded cluster masses from the required ionizing fluxes .",
    "comparison with the sdss - band upper limits then gives a lower limit to the extinction .",
    "the sdss - band upper limit flux in a dust lane , @xmath28 , is taken to be the rms value of the sdss pixel counts , @xmath29 , multiplied by the counts - to - specific flux conversion factor , @xmath30 , divided by the square root of the number of pixels , @xmath31 , and multiplied by the student - t value @xmath32 giving 95% probability that the mean count is less than @xmath33 .",
    "that is , the probability that the mean flux from the source is less than the measured mean ( @xmath34 here ) plus the increment @xmath35 is 0.95 . here",
    ", @xmath29 comes from the iraf measurement of the source counts .",
    "the value of @xmath36 is for a typical number of pixels in a source , @xmath37 , so the number of degrees of freedom for the student - t statistic is @xmath38 , and the probability that the true mean @xmath39 is between @xmath40 and @xmath41 is 0.90 .",
    "this is the same as saying that @xmath42 with 95% confidence for @xmath32 .",
    "the limiting magnitude is obtained from the limiting source flux using the usual ab conversion , mag@xmath43 for @xmath28 in ergs @xmath44 s@xmath45 hz@xmath45 .",
    "table [ results ] lists the positions of the embedded sources , the number of pixels of @xmath12 size in the measured rectangles , their fluxes , @xmath46 , at @xmath10 m in @xmath39jy , ab absolute magnitudes in irac @xmath10 m , ab absolute magnitude upper limits in the sdss bands , and the h@xmath1 luminosities measured from ground - based observations .",
    "without optical detections of the embedded sources and only irac observations at @xmath13 resolution from _ spitzer _ and @xmath23 m observations at @xmath24 resolution from 2mass , we can not uniquely determine the source ages , masses and extinctions . however , the sources are all embedded in spiral arm dust lanes and likely to be young ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as also implied by the h@xmath1 , so we searched over a range of ages , and for each age determined the cluster mass and extinction required to give the observed @xmath0 m and @xmath23 m fluxes using the conversion to intrinsic h@xmath1 in @xcite : @xmath47 - 0.5 i[1.25\\mu{\\rm m}]\\right)/0.043\\ ] ] for @xmath48 in units of mjy / ster .",
    "that is , @xmath49 and @xmath50 in mjy / ster were measured from the background subtracted specific fluxes in each source ( in units of @xmath39jy from the image source counts ) , converted to mjy and divided by the area of the source in ster .",
    "the resulting @xmath51 was then multiplied by a typical h@xmath1 filter width in frequency units , @xmath52 , which comes from the filter width in wavelength units , @xmath53 , converted to frequency with the equation @xmath54 .",
    "this gives the source h@xmath1 flux in units of erg @xmath44 s@xmath45 .",
    "the intrinsic h@xmath1 flux derived in this way from the ir , and the directly measured h@xmath1 flux from ground - based observations , were converted to h@xmath1 luminosities @xmath55 by multiplying by @xmath56 for distance @xmath57 , and then to observed ionization rates @xmath58 using the equation @xmath59 s@xmath45 @xcite .",
    "these observed ionization rates were compared to stellar evolution models to determine intrinsic source properties .    for the stellar models , we used tables in @xcite for ab magnitude versus time in _ u , g , r , i _ , and _ z _ bands , which are given for a unit of solar mass in an initial cluster with a fully sampled chabrier imf and solar abundances .",
    "we also used the tables for lyman continuum ionization rate versus time per unit initial solar mass , and residual stellar mass versus time per unit initial solar mass .",
    "the optical magnitudes were converted to luminosities per unit initial mass , and these along with the lyman continuum rate and the residual stellar mass , were integrated over time up to the assumed age using a constant star formation rate .",
    "this integral over the model lyman continuum rate per unit initial mass will be denoted by @xmath60 , and the integral over the model residual mass per unit initial mass will be denoted by @xmath61 .    the ratio of the observed ionization rate @xmath58 to the model rate @xmath62 gives the correction factor to the model integrated mass , from which the required cluster mass can be derived : @xmath63 the integrated luminosities in each sdss band were found from the same ratio , e.g. , @xmath64)l_{\\rm m , u}(t)$ ] for _ u_-band , and converted back to apparent magnitude .",
    "the resulting model magnitudes in all five sdss bands were then subtracted from the observed magnitude limits in each band to get the minimum extinction in each band .",
    "these were all converted to _ g_-band extinction using the extinction curve in @xcite , and the results were averaged together .",
    "this extinction curve should be more appropriate for embedded sources than the gray type of extinction that comes from a partially transparent screen @xcite .",
    "the different limiting g - converted extinctions varied among the passbands by an average of 0.5 mag , presumably because the sdss limits were not the same depth relative to the spectral energy distribution of the source .",
    "table 3 gives the derived properties of the embedded sources listed in table 2 for assumed ages of 3 myr .",
    "the masses and average _ g_-band - equivalent extinctions for the ground - based h@xmath1 measurements are in columns 3 and 4 , the masses and average _ g_-band - equivalent extinctions for the @xmath0 m measurements are in columns 5 and 6 , and the extinction needed in the hii region , measured at _",
    "g_-band , to produce the observed h@xmath1 fluxes given the star forming regions measured at @xmath0 m , are in column 7 .",
    "the sources with lower limits have upper limits for the directly observed h@xmath1 fluxes ( more on this below and in the footnote to table 3 ) .",
    "all sources are observed at @xmath0 m .",
    "the derived cluster masses increase with assumed age in the range from 1 to 10 myr by about a factor of 2.5 for all sources ( not shown ) .",
    "this is small enough for the likely age range that we consider here only masses for an assumed age of 3 myr , as tabulated , with an uncertainty of a factor of 1.6 either way from unknown age effects .",
    "the mass differences obtained using the two methods , direct h@xmath1 observations and h@xmath1 inferred from @xmath0 m and @xmath23 m emissions , typically differed by a factor of 24 with the ir - based masses being larger .",
    "this difference amounts to an excess extinction of about 3.5 magnitudes for the direct h@xmath1 compared to the ir - derived h@xmath1 .",
    "table 4 gives the embedded source masses and extinctions for the two types of measurements and the equivalent @xmath17-band extinction in the hii region to give h@xmath1 consistent with @xmath0 m and @xmath23 m , averaged over all sources in each galaxy .",
    "the masses measured by direct h@xmath1 observations average @xmath65 , and the masses measured by @xmath0 m and @xmath23 m observations and converted to h@xmath1 average @xmath66 .",
    "the lower limits to the extinctions provided by the upper limits to the sdss fluxes and the ground - based h@xmath1 fluxes ( column 3 ) are about zero , meaning that the h@xmath1 measurements are consistent with the optical broad - band measurements in being highly extincted .",
    "in other words , given the stellar masses required to produce the ( highly extincted ) h@xmath1 fluxes that were directly observed , the expected @xmath67 fluxes are comparable to the upper limits within a few tenths of a magnitude ( the error bars in column 3 of table 4 ) .",
    "the lower limits to the extinctions derived from the @xmath0 m fluxes in comparison to the sdss bands ( column 5 ) are , on average , @xmath2 mag for all galaxies .",
    "this is comparable to the extinction in the hii region ( column 6 ) because the hii emission is extincted by about the same amount as the sdss bands .",
    "we conclude that these dusty regions are obscuring young stellar associations with an average mass of @xmath66 for an age of about 3 myr",
    ". the average mass would be @xmath68 for an age of 1 myr and @xmath69 for an age of 10 myr .",
    "the average extinction to these regions in @xmath17-band is @xmath2 magnitudes .",
    "we consider possible star formation mechanisms as summarized in the introduction .",
    "two of these mechanisms , the parker and thermal instabilities , involve diffuse gas without self - gravity . while they may contribute to interstellar structure , they are not involved with rapid star formation because that requires self - gravity and collapsing cloud cores .",
    "the other mechanisms , gravitational instabilities and cloud impacts or collisions , involve strong self - gravity from an early stage , the first because whole dust lanes can be unstable to fragmentation along their lengths , and the second because collisions increase a cloud s density and that can make the cloud gravitationally unstable .",
    "the observation of bright embedded infrared sources in galactic spiral shocks implies that massive star formation begins quickly in the shocked gas ",
    "faster than the time delay usually inferred from the displacement between dust lanes or co emission and visible hii regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the observed mass of @xmath70 is comparable to the masses of more visible clusters and star - forming regions in normal galaxies .    in what follows ,",
    "we consider two possible formation mechanisms for the observed star complexes . for both ,",
    "the dust lanes are assumed to be shocks in spiral density waves .",
    "this is consistent with the streaming motions that are often observed in co observations of these regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "most of the molecular clouds in the milky way spiral arms @xcite seem related to spiral shocks too , considering their velocities and positions in the global spiral pattern @xcite .",
    "their concentration in spiral arms is apparent in the face - on view of the milky way shown by @xcite .",
    "evidently , these local co clouds would resemble dust lanes if they were viewed from outside the milky way .",
    "the two mechanisms considered are ( 1 ) gravitational collapse of gas that accumulates behind the shock front in a spiral arm , and ( 2 ) compression and collapse of pre - existing clouds that hit these shock fronts . in the following discussion",
    ", we suggest that gravitational collapse of spiral arm shock fronts is too slow on kpc scales to account for the rapid onset of star formation that appears to be required for these embedded sources .",
    "the densest parts of the shocked gas could have collapsed into stars , however .",
    "compression of interarm clouds that hit previously shocked gas could trigger the obscured sources faster .",
    "additional considerations are needed to determine which mechanisms apply .",
    "table [ averages ] suggests that a typical value of optical extinction to an embedded dust lane source is @xmath2 mag .",
    "an embedded source with @xmath71 mag of extinction may be inside a dust cloud that has @xmath72 mag of extinction all the way through it if the source is centered .",
    "this makes the total column density through the cloud @xmath73 pc@xmath74 for @xmath75 @xcite , ratio of total - to - selective extinction @xmath76 @xcite , and mean atomic weight 1.36 .",
    "a typical dust lane width is @xmath77 pixels in figures 15 ( 1 px@xmath78 ) , which is @xmath79 pc at a distance of 10 mpc .",
    "the dust lane linear density is the product of these , @xmath80 pc@xmath45 , or @xmath81 g cm@xmath45 .",
    "the critical line density for collapse of a filament is @xmath83 for 1-dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath84 @xcite . if @xmath85 km s@xmath45 in the shock , then @xmath86 is comparable to the observed line density .",
    "this suggests that spiral arm shock fronts are unstable to collapse along their lengths @xcite .",
    "the result of this collapse would be one or more giant cloud complexes with masses equal to @xmath87 for spacing @xmath88 between the complexes along the arm @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath89 from the figures here and from @xcite , the resulting cloud mass is @xmath90 . if we consider a typical efficiency of 2% for the star - forming complex , then a stellar mass of @xmath91 results , large enough to account for what we observe .",
    "the key to star formation in spiral arm dust lanes is that it has to happen quickly , before the spiral arm passes and the shocked gas decompresses in the interarm .",
    "this is a strong constraint if the spiral wave is steady .",
    "not all compressed regions will be part of a steady flow , however .",
    "if a dust lane is sufficiently self - gravitating , then it can remain intact as a giant cloud complex even when it enters the interarm region , making its lifetime longer than the arm crossing time .",
    "such shocks would not be steady but would cycle between gas build up , collapse , and dispersal .",
    "if the lifetime of the compressed state is long enough , then interarm protrusions and spurs result @xcite with star formation lingering in the interarm regions .",
    "@xcite observed m51 with 30 pc resolution and could see cloud build - up from small interarm co clouds to giant molecular associations as the gas flowed into and through the spiral arms . with 780 pc resolution , the excitation state of m51 co clouds changes from low in the interarm regions to high in the arms , corresponding to an increase in density and/or temperature with increasing star formation activity @xcite .",
    "there is also an indication in m51 of dense co gas just before prominent spiral arm star formation ; the map in figure 6 of @xcite shows regions with highly excited co and low @xmath7 m emission .",
    "these regions appear to be centered on dust lanes , although their exact spatial distribution is uncertain because the 780 pc resolution scale of the map is much larger than a dust lane .",
    "these regions avoid the parts of the dust lanes where we identify the brightest embedded sources , but that is expected from the lack of @xmath7 m emission in the @xcite sources .",
    "similarly , @xcite observed molecular clouds in ic 342 turn from weakly self - gravitating in the interarm regions to strongly self - gravitating and star - forming in the arms .",
    "we now consider when the collapse of density wave - shocked gas is fast enough to make stars in the steady state case .",
    "this requires a comparison between the collapse time of this gas and its dwelling time in the arm .",
    "the dwelling time for gas in a dust lane is the arm - to - arm time multiplied by the ratio of the gas mass inside the dust lane within some radial interval to the total gas mass from one arm to the next in that radial interval .",
    "this relationship is from the continuity equation . because of streaming motion along the arm in the dust lane , this dwelling time is longer than the purely geometric time obtained from the ratio of the angular thickness of the dust lane measured from the galaxy center divided by the angular rate of the spiral pattern relative to the gas .",
    "the ratio of the dust lane mass to the total arm - to - arm gas mass in a radial interval equals the ratio of the dust lane column density to the average column density , multiplied by the relative angular extent of the dust lane . in the star - forming part of the main disk of most spiral galaxies ,",
    "v_-band extinction averaged in azimuth is typically about 1 magnitude .",
    "recall that the column density for general extinction @xmath92 equals @xmath93 pc@xmath74 in units of surface density , and an average value of @xmath94 pc@xmath74 for spiral galaxy disks is typical inside the molecular zone @xcite . for a general case like this , the ratio of column densities is then approximately @xmath95 for @xmath96 in the dust lane .",
    "the arm - to - arm distance is @xmath97 for a two - arm spiral at radius @xmath98 .",
    "taking @xmath99 kpc as representative , the relative dust lane thickness is @xmath100% with @xmath101 pc from above .",
    "thus the fraction of the gas mass in the dust lane , which is also the fraction of the arm - to - arm time in the dust lane , is approximately @xmath102 .",
    "the arm - to - arm time is @xmath103 myr for a position at @xmath104 kpc that is halfway to corotation where the galaxy rotation speed is @xmath105 km s@xmath45 .",
    "then the dwelling time for gas in the dust lane is @xmath106 myr . in general , the dust lane flow - through time is @xmath107 for dust lane width @xmath108 , azimuthal speed @xmath109 of the spiral arm relative to the gas , and average extinction through the disk at the radius of the dust lane , @xmath110 .",
    "this result does not depend on @xmath98 explicitly .",
    "if @xmath108 is in pc and @xmath111 is in km s@xmath45 , then the unit of this flow - through time is approximately in myr .",
    "the fraction of the time that gas spends in the vicinity of a spiral arm can be fairly high for a strong arm .",
    "for example , a co map of the galaxy shown in figure 4 , ngc 5248 @xcite , has two spiral arms midway out with @xmath112 k km s@xmath45 integrated intensities that occupy about 20%-25% of the azimuthal distance to the next arm , and it shows interarm regions with less than 3 k km s@xmath45 .",
    "thus the arms contain about half of the gas at that radius ( @xmath113 ) , and the arm dwelling time is half of the arm - to - arm time if most of the gas is molecular",
    ". this fraction would be lower if the @xmath114-factor that converts co to h@xmath115 is lower in the arms than in the interarms because of greater co temperatures in the arms . using @xmath116 km s@xmath45 , which is half of the rotation speed of ngc 5248 @xcite , assuming this position is half the distance to co - rotation , and assuming a galactocentric distance of 1 arcmin @xmath77 kpc ,",
    "the arm - to - arm time is 126 myr and the arm dwelling time could be about 60 - 70 myr . in the spiral arms of m51 @xcite , the dust lanes appear as thin ribbons of co emission nearly resolved by carma .",
    "they occupy about 10% of the azimuthal angle and have 5 to 10 times the average interarm intensity in co. thus even the thin co arms in m51 contain 30% to 50% of the molecular mass at that radius , and because most of the gas in this galaxy is molecular @xcite , this is also approximately the fraction of the arm - to - arm time spent in the dust lanes ( unless the @xmath114-factor varies ) .",
    "the dwelling time in a spiral arm has to be compared with the timescale for self - gravitational collapse .",
    "the latter is about @xmath117 for length - to - width ratio @xmath118 along the dust lane and for density @xmath119 .",
    "the factor @xmath118 comes from the average equivalent density @xmath120 in a sphere containing the fragment , considering that the collapse time is @xmath121 for that average . in agreement with this , @xcite show one case of a filament with a collapse to a singularity in @xmath122 , which is @xmath123 , giving @xmath124 in their case ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the average dust lane density is the extinction through the disk , @xmath96 , converted into grams @xmath44 , divided by the line - of - sight thickness , which is @xmath125 pc for a typical molecular disk . for @xmath126 in parsecs ,",

    "this result implies that sufficiently dense spiral shocks , i.e. , those with extinctions through the disk greater than @xmath140 mag for these numbers , should have time to collapse along their lengths into new cloud complexes . because self - gravity is important from the start in such an instability , the cloud complexes that form will also be strongly self - gravitating , and should form stars at an accelerating pace while they collapse further .",
    "recall that our sources imply @xmath141 mag on average , considering we see the foreground extinction equal to half of this value .",
    "this extinction is slightly less than the critical value of 18 mag derived above , suggesting that the dust lanes we observe are only marginally unstable to collapse in the short time they have .",
    "if the line - of - sight cloud thicknesses were much smaller than the assumed @xmath125 pc , such as the size of a giant molecular cloud , @xmath142 pc , then @xmath143 pc , and this would be closer to our observations . in either case",
    ", the observed dust lanes do not appear to be strongly self - gravitating and in the process of rapid collapse .",
    "they could be forming stars only in the initially dense regions that were most unstable before they entered the spiral arm .",
    "such partial collapse is consistent with the spiral shock models by @xcite and with the growing evidence for star formation in marginally bound or unbound molecular clouds ( i.e. , but which are still unstable to collapse in their cores ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite ran simulations showing the steady accumulation of shocked gas in spiral arms , with dust lane density perturbations building up over several rotation periods from initially small amplitudes . eventually the irregularities caused by gaseous self - gravity led to the formation of giant , self - gravitating clouds .",
    "this is essentially the process we have in mind here for the formation of the observed embedded sources .",
    "@xcite showed examples of beads - on - a - string of star formation along spiral arms of all types , ranging from two - arm grand design spirals to multiple , long - arm spirals , to flocculent spirals ( see also elmegreen & elmegreen 1983 ) . beads - on - a - string patterns were studied in detail by @xcite using irac images like those considered here . in many images from the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ satellite ( _ galex _ ; martin et al . 2005 ) , one gets the impression that most star formation is in complexes that are strung out along spiral arms in a semi - regular fashion .",
    "interstellar magnetic fields may be involved in this regularity @xcite . evidently , there is a close resemblance between spiral arm star formation on kpc scales and filamentary star formation @xcite inside molecular clouds on parsec scales .",
    "compression and collapse of an incident interarm cloud can be faster than the collapse time calculated above for an initially uniform dust lane .",
    "the compression time @xmath144 is the cloud size @xmath145 divided by the relative perpendicular speed between the cloud and the spiral arm , @xmath146 . for a relative azimuthal speed between the cloud and the arm , @xmath139 km s@xmath45 as above , the perpendicular speed is @xmath147 km s@xmath45 when the spiral arm pitch angle is @xmath148 .",
    "then @xmath149 myr for @xmath150 pc .",
    "collapse would follow compression quickly because the compressed cloud density is high , approximately equal to the product of the interarm cloud density , @xmath151 ( in @xmath152pc@xmath153 for an interarm cloud extinction @xmath154 and line - of - sight thickness @xmath126 in pc ) multiplied by the square of the ratio of the perpendicular compression speed to the cloud thermal speed , @xmath155 . for @xmath156 mag , @xmath137 pc , @xmath157 km s@xmath45 , and @xmath158 km s@xmath45 , the compressed cloud density is @xmath159 atoms",
    "@xmath128 and the cloud collapse time , measured as @xmath160 , is @xmath161 myr . if such a density extends for @xmath137 pc along the line of sight , then the extinction through the disk would be @xmath162 mag and the extinction to an embedded source @xmath163 mag .",
    "this is significantly larger than what we observe here for the clouds on @xmath79 pc scales , but could apply in their cores .",
    "the original picture of cloud compression in spiral shocks was based on simulations by @xcite of a small diffuse cloud engulfed by a rapidly moving , infinitely - extended shock front .",
    "the cloud is compressed by the post - shock gas and forms a cometary structure , with the head collapsing into stars .",
    "many simulations have confirmed this basic process .",
    "spiral arms do not typically show cometary clouds and the dust lanes surrounding the embedded sources discussed here are not cometary . still ,",
    "the basic model of cloud compression upon impact with an existing spiral arm dust lane ( from a previous shock ) seems generally valid .",
    "the interarm clouds in figures 15 are spiral - like with large cloud complexes distributed along their lengths .",
    "this interarm structure is also evident from well - resolved maps of ir @xcite and co @xcite , as in the case of m51 .",
    "such shapes are remnants of dust lane structures , secondary shocks , and spurs from the previous arms @xcite .",
    "interarm cloud complexes can be moderately massive : @xmath164 if @xmath150 pc and @xmath165 mag .",
    "the most opaque interarm clouds may contain @xmath4 and have a substantial molecular fraction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the observed masses of the largest embedded complexes found here are consistent with interarm cloud compression .",
    "the pre - collision clouds would have to be @xmath163 times more massive than the observed stellar masses , considering a star formation efficiency on @xmath166 pc scales of 2% . to form a @xmath167 star complex inside a dust lane ( table 4 )",
    ", the previous interarm cloud would have to contain @xmath168 .",
    "such a cloud , if spherical , would be @xmath169 pc in diameter if its average extinction is @xmath165 mag .",
    "with such a size in two dimensions , the cloud would form a @xmath169 pc long dust filament when it hits the spiral arm , and then the collapse to star formation would be like the dust lane collapse discussed above , with motions along its length and a factor @xmath89 geometric dilution of the collapse time .",
    "regular spacing of large star complexes along spiral arms , as occasionally seen in figures 15 and in other galaxies , implies that an instability might be involved and we are seeing the fastest growing wavelength of that instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of several young sources in this string implies that the instability operates all along the length of the pattern with a nearly uniform starting time , to within some variation equal to the instability time or the arm dwelling time .",
    "such simultaneity requires that the dust lanes with regular star formation evolved within this time interval , that is , they built up , fragmented , and turned into stars along the length of the regular pattern within several tens of myrs .",
    "after this , another dust lane would be expected to build up to replace it using fresh interarm gas .",
    "this would be the case for a continuously moving spiral arm that accumulates gas , dumps it into star complexes and then accumulates more gas .",
    "alternatively , the whole stellar and gaseous arm could have formed recently as a result of a spiral instability in the disk @xcite .",
    "then the arm structure itself would be fairly young ( although the stellar populations in it would be mostly old ) and it could just now be forming its first string of star formation , i.e. , within the last @xmath170 myr . in both cases , the instability would be slow compared to the dynamics of star formation , so the ob associations that form would be in various stages of obscuration and break - out , ranging from embedded for the youngest to fully exposed with adjacent cloud debris for the oldest in the same arm segment .    in cases without a regular spacing along spiral arms , a similar time sequence may occur with spiral - shocked gas followed by partial cloud collapse , star formation , and cloud dispersal , but with more of a distributed starting time",
    ". then there will be different phases in this process at different positions along the arm .",
    "there could also be other processes acting , such as direct compression of interarm clouds , which would be randomly placed with respect to the regular structures .",
    "a search for emission at @xmath0 m that has no associated optical counterpart in sdss images and only weak emission at h@xmath1 revealed 73 sources that are likely to be young star formation regions embedded in molecular clouds .",
    "the clouds appear as dark dust lanes in the spiral arms .",
    "the intrinsic h@xmath1 emission of each source was estimated from the @xmath0 m and @xmath23 m emissions using the method of @xcite , and the luminosity of the associated stars was determined after assuming an age in the range of 1 to 10 myr .",
    "this stellar luminosity , combined with upper limits from the sdss images , gave lower limits to the extinction and stellar mass .",
    "the observed h@xmath1 , compared with the h@xmath1 estimated from @xmath0 m and @xmath23 m , gave a consistent value for the extinction , which is apparently near the estimated lower limit ( or else the h@xmath1 would not be observed either ) .",
    "the average mass of an embedded source was found to be @xmath171 and the average extinction at @xmath17-band is @xmath172 mag .",
    "these sources are often parts of regular strings of star formation with additional embedded sources and other sources in various stages of lower obscuration .",
    "two mechanisms for triggering this star formation were considered : gravitational collapse of spiral density wave - shocked gas and gravitational collapse of compressed incident clouds .",
    "the spiral shock model suggests that the clouds we are observing are not strongly self - gravitating because they have not had enough time after their formation in the spiral arm .",
    "still , collapse should occur in dense cores of these clouds even if the overall cloud complexes are weakly bound .",
    "this is consistent with recent ideas that star formation occurs in the dense cores of generally unbound molecular clouds .",
    "the incident cloud model is also consistent with our observations if , again , the shock compression and collapse to star formation occurs primarily in unseen dense cores .    the regular distribution of star formation along spiral arms , including the embedded sources as well as the exposed sources , suggest that a mild instability is operating to form weakly bound molecular clouds simultaneously along kpc lengths .",
    "simultaneity on these scales requires a uniform initial starting time for the instability , to within the unstable growth time or the flow - through time . in that case",
    "the arm could be relatively young , or the shock front in the arm could be relatively new .",
