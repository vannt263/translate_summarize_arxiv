    "the black holes in the hearts of galaxies and galaxy clusters are commonly observed to be associated with powerful relativistic jets .",
    "the mechanism by which such jets form and the efficiency with which the energy associated with material entering the accretion radius is converted into jet power at much smaller radii remains the subject of much debate .",
    "such knowledge is important for understanding the nature of the accretion process , galaxy formation and the growth of supermassive black holes .",
    "x - ray studies with chandra and xmm - newton , building on earlier work with rosat , have shown that the black holes at the centres of galaxies , groups and clusters interact strongly with their environments , blowing clear cavities or ` bubbles ' in the surrounding x - ray emitting gas ( bhringer 1993 ; fabian 2000 , 2003 , 2005 ; birzan 2004 ; forman 2005 ) .",
    "simple arguments based on the energy required to inflate the bubbles and the sound speed of the surrounding gas allow these bubbles to be used as calorimeters , measuring the power released by the jets ( churazov 2002 ) .",
    "importantly , the exquisite spatial resolution of chandra means that for the largest , nearby ellipticals we are also able to resolve regions close to the bondi accretion radii in these systems . given estimates for the central black hole masses from measured galaxy velocity dispersions , the observed density and temperature profiles of the x - ray emitting gas can be used to estimate the accretion rates onto the black holes ( bondi 1952 ) . taken together , the accretion rates and jet powers then allow us to estimate the efficiency with which the rest mass of accreted matter is converted into jet power .",
    "the observed luminosities of agn in elliptical galaxies are typically several orders of magnitude lower than would be predicted from the standard bondi formulae , assuming a conversion efficiency for matter into radiation of order 10 per cent .",
    "however , much of the predicted power may actually be released in the form of jets .",
    "this issue was investigated by di matteo ( 2003 ) and taylor ( 2006 ) who noted that although the central agn in ngc4486 ( m87 ) , ngc4696 and ngc6166 have bolometric luminosities three orders of magnitude below the bondi predictions ( for 10 per cent efficiency ) , the jet powers inferred from the observed x - ray cavities are comparable to the bondi values , within a factor of a few .",
    "pellegrini ( 2003 ) used related arguments to infer a minimum conversion efficiency for accreted mass into jet power of @xmath9 per cent for the elliptical galaxy ic4296 . here , we extend the work of di matteo 2003 and taylor ( 2006 ) to a sample of nine nearby , x - ray bright ellipticals with good x - ray data and optical velocity dispersion measurements .",
    "the origin of the observed galaxy luminosity function and , in particular , the mechanism responsible for truncating star formation in the largest ellipticals is also a subject of much debate ( benson 2003 , croton 2005 ; bower 2005 , and references therein ) . here , again",
    ", significant insight has been provided by xmm - newton and chandra observations ( tamura 2001 ; allen 2001 ; peterson 2001 , 2003 ) which show that the cooling rates in the cores of galaxies , groups and clusters are much smaller than the values predicted by simple models that do not include feedback .",
    "some widespread form of heating must be operating in galaxies and clusters to stem cooling .",
    "we show here that the kinetic power released in jets from the central black hole engines can , in principle , provide this heat and stem further star formation .",
    "our target galaxies are bright , nearby ellipticals with accurate central black hole mass measurements or velocity dispersions which allow the black hole masses to be estimated using the relation of tremaine ( 2002 ) .",
    "the chandra archive was searched to identify all such systems with x - ray luminous gaseous halos and obvious jet - induced cavities in the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "we have restricted our target list to those systems in which the bubbles are attached ( or very close to ) to the central agn , which are therefore likely to be undergoing inflation .",
    "we have also required that the chandra exposure times be sufficient to allow precise measurements of the central density and temperature of the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "finally , we required that the x - ray data allow us to measure the properties of the x - ray emitting gas within one order of magnitude of the bondi radius , permitting reliable measurements or extrapolations of the gas properties at that radius to be made .",
    "these selection criteria are matched by eight galaxies with data in the chandra archive .",
    "for comparison purposes , we also include results for one more distant system , ngc6166 , the dominant galaxy of abell 2199 .",
    "although , due to its greater distance , we do not come close to resolving the bondi radius in this system , the density profile follows a simple power - law form which allows an interesting extrapolation to smaller radii .",

    "systematic uncertainties in the temperature estimates are unlikely to affect other results reported here significantly .",
    "the calculation of accretion rates onto the central black holes follows the work of bondi ( 1952 ) .",
    "similar calculations are described by di matteo ( 2001 , 2003 ) , churazov ( 2002 ) , pellegrini ( 2003 ) and taylor ( 2006 ) .    under the assumption of spherical symmetry and negligible angular momentum",
    ", the rate of accretion of the x - ray emitting gas at the accretion radius can be written as ( bondi 1952 )    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the density of the gas at the accretion radius ( we assume @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 is a numerical coefficient that depends upon the adiabatic index of the accreting gas . for an assumed adiabatic index @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( bondi 1952 ) .",
    "note that for @xmath23 , @xmath25 is constant within the accretion flow , making it appropriate to use the gas temperature and density measured at the accretion radius in our calculations , in place of the values at infinity .",
    "( in essence , we are modelling the accretion flows as bondi flows inward of the accretion radii . for @xmath26 , the gravitational potentials of the galaxies start to dominate and the bondi formulae become inappropriate . )    for an efficiency @xmath27 , relating the accretion rate at the accretion radius to the total energy emitted from within that radius , the maximum power released from the black hole system is    @xmath28    the values of @xmath6 , for an assumed value of @xmath29 are summarized in table  [ table : bondi ] . the statistical uncertainties in the results have been estimated from monte carlo simulations , which account for the uncertainties in the @xmath30 measurements , the slope of the log@xmath31log@xmath30 relation and uncertainties in the temperature and density measurements at the accretion radii .",
    "an intrinsic ( systematic ) dispersion of 0.23 dex in the log@xmath31log@xmath30 relation ( tremaine 2002 ) implies a systematic uncertainty of 0.46 dex in both log@xmath32 and log@xmath6 .",
    "these systematic errors are comparable to the measurement errors for most galaxies , and dominate for ngc507 .      to estimate the kinetic power of the jets , we first estimated the energy , @xmath33 required to create the observed bubbles in the x - ray emitting gas . for slow expansion rates , this is the sum of the internal energy within the bubble and the @xmath34 work done    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the thermal pressure of the surrounding , x - ray emitting gas ( which can be determined from the observed x - ray temperatures and densities ) , v is the volume of the cavity and @xmath37 is the mean adiabatic index of the fluid within the cavity .",
    "for the case of a bubble filled with relativistic plasma , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . some additional energy will also be transfered into sound waves ( churazov 2002 ; fabian 2003 , 2005 , 2006 ; forman 2003 ; ruszkowski 2004 ) .",
    "we have neglected this extra energy in our calculations , although the power involved is likely to be smaller than the quoted uncertainties on the jet powers .",
    "the regions identified with the bubbles are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : img ] . in general , the bubbles appear to be ` attached ' to the central agn and are likely to be undergoing expansion at present .",
    "a possible exception to this is ngc4472 , where the bubbles may have recently detached . in cases where the edges of the bubbles are not clearly defined in the x - ray data , we have used radio observations to estimate their volumes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : img ] ) .",
    "the x - ray and radio data show that in general , the bubbles or cavities are approximately elliptical .",
    "we have therefore parameterized the projected areas of the bubbles in terms of a semi - axis length , @xmath40 , along the jet direction and semi - axis width , @xmath41 , across it .",
    "this allows the cavities to be modelled as ellipsoids with volumes @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the unknown depth of the cavity along the line of sight .",
    "we model the cavities as prolate ellipsoids with @xmath44 , although systematic uncertainties in @xmath45 , @xmath41 and , especially , @xmath43 mean that our estimates of the bubble volumes should be regarded as uncertain at the factor @xmath46 level .",
    "following birzan ( 2004 ; see also dunn & fabian 2004 , dunn , fabian & taylor 2005 ) we have estimated the ages of the bubbles as    @xmath47    [ eq : age ]    where r is the distance of the bubble centre from the black hole , which provides a reasonable match to some numerical simulations .",
    "we note that the bubbles have lower mass density than the surrounding x - ray emitting gas and can therefore be expected to rise with a buoyancy velocity , @xmath48 . here",
    "@xmath49 is the cross - sectional area of the bubble ( in the rise direction ) , @xmath50 is the volume , @xmath51 is the drag coefficient and @xmath52 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "the times required for bubbles of the observed sizes to rise buoyantly through a uniform medium from the galaxy centres to their current radii is approximately @xmath53 .",
    "application of this formula leads to comparable timescales to the @xmath54 values .",
    "however , since the bubbles studied here are typically still attached to the jets , we adopt @xmath54 as our relevant timescale .    the power involved in ` blowing '",
    "the bubbles can be estimated as    @xmath55    the results on @xmath7 are summarized in table  [ table : buoy ] .",
    "the uncertainties on @xmath7 are determined from monte carlo simulations which include the sources of statistical uncertainty mentioned above as well as a factor 2 systematic uncertainty in the bubble volumes .",

    "both powers are in units of @xmath57 . for each galaxy ,",
    "we have combined the power estimates for both bubbles , with the uncertainties added in quadrature . a clear correlation between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 exists , which can be described by a power law model of the form    @xmath58    using the @xmath59 fit statistic , which accounts only for errors in the @xmath6 values , we find @xmath60 and @xmath61 , with @xmath62 for 7 degrees of freedom ( the quoted uncertainties on @xmath63 and @xmath64 are 68 per cent confidence intervals ) . using the bces(@xmath65 ) estimator of akritas & bershady ( 1996 ) , which accounts for errors in both axes and the presence of possible intrinsic scatter , we obtain @xmath66 and @xmath67 . the mean deviation about the best fitting bces model is @xmath68",
    ".    the results on @xmath63 and @xmath64 quoted above do not account for the effects of intrinsic ( systematic ) scatter in the log@xmath31log@xmath30 relation .",
    "we have used further monte carlo simulations to examine these effects , introducing an intrinsic dispersion of 0.46 dex in log@xmath6",
    ". fits to the simulated data sets using the bces(@xmath65 ) estimator give @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in good agreement with the results presented above but with ( slightly ) larger error bars on the fit parameters .",
    "the results shown in fig  [ fig : pbondi ] indicate the presence of a strong correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "a power - law model provides a good description of the data .",
    "however , in gauging the origin and significance of this correlation , we must also consider effects that could arise from the plotted quantities having factors in common . both @xmath6 and @xmath7 depend on the distances to the objects .",
    "however , @xmath69 , whereas @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the distance dependences can not lead to the observed positive correlation .",
    "both axes in fig  [ fig : pbondi ] also depend on the temperature @xmath71 of the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "however , the temperature shows little variation from object to object and varies only mildly with radius between the accretion and bubble radii .",
    "moreover , the dependences on temperature are approximately @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which can not lead to the observed positive correlation .",
    "finally , both axes involve the gas density , measured at the accretion radius for @xmath6 and at the bubble centres for @xmath7 .",
    "these radii are very different and the density profiles vary significantly from object to object , meaning that the densities are essentially uncorrelated .",
    "( in detail , a mild anti - correlation is observed ) .",
    "we conclude that the observed correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 indicates a tight physical connection between the two quantities .",
    "we have shown that for supermassive black holes at the centres of large , x - ray luminous elliptical galaxies , a remarkable , tight correlation exists between the ` bondi ' accretion rates inferred from the chandra x - ray data and observed galaxy velocity dispersions , and the power emerging from these systems in relativistic jets .",
    "our result has important implications for the nature of the accretion process and for issues relating to feedback , the growth of black holes and galaxy formation .",
    "the relationship between the bondi accretion power and jet power can be described by a power law model of the form log@xmath74log@xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath7 is the power associated with inflating the cavities and providing the internal energy of the plasma that fills them . a significant fraction ( @xmath4 per cent , for @xmath5 ) of the energy associated with the rest mass of material entering the bondi accretion radius emerges from the systems in relativistic jets .",
    "there is a slight indication that this fraction increases as @xmath7 rises , from @xmath77 per cent at @xmath78 , to @xmath79 per cent at @xmath80 .",
    "( here , the quoted uncertainties include all sources of statistical and systematic error discussed in the text , including systematic scatter in the log@xmath31log@xmath30 relation . )",
    "the existence of such a tight correlation suggests that the bondi formalism provides a reasonable description of the accretion process in these systems , despite the fact that the accreting gas contains magnetic fields ( taylor 2006 ) and , presumably , has some angular momentum .",
    "moreover , the similarity of the @xmath7 and @xmath56 values suggests that a significant fraction of the matter passing through the accretion radius flows all the way down to regions close to the black hole , where it presumably provides the power source for the jets .",
    "this provides an important constraint on both accretion and jet formation models .",
    "in particular , our results limit the amount of material that may be lost from the accretion flows en route to the region of jet formation and requires that jet formation must be efficient ; a few per cent of the energy associated with the rest mass of material entering the accretion radius emerges in the jets .",
    "the origin of the jets may be related to the spin of the central black hole ( rees 1978 ; hughes & blandford 2003 ) . in that case",
    ", the observed tight correlation between jet power and accretion rate may suggest a narrow range of black hole spins for the objects in our sample .",
    "the x - ray emitting gaseous halos in the giant elliptical galaxies studied here are likely to have existed for billions of years .",
    "the growth of the black holes may therefore have been dominated by gas accretion , which tends to lead to large spin parameters ( volonteri 2005 ) and it is possible that the black holes are rotating at close to their maximal rates .",
    "however , the detailed interaction between accretion , spin - up and jet power remains to be explored .",
    "the tight correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 also suggests that the accretion flows in the galaxies are stable over the periods required for gas to flow from the accretion radii to the base of the jets _ plus _ the times required for the bubbles to be inflated .",
    "the flow times @xmath81 are of the order a few @xmath82 to a few @xmath83 yr , whereas the bubble ages range from @xmath84  ( table  [ table : buoy ] ) .",
    "thus , our results suggest that the accretion flows in the present sample of objects are approximately stable over timescales of @xmath85",
    ".    the black holes studied here are accreting at rates of a few @xmath86 to a few @xmath87  and converting a few per cent of their accreted rest mass into jet energy .",
    "the nuclear luminosities ( pellegrini 2005 ) are typically 2 - 4 orders of magnitude lower than the @xmath7 values , so the systems are ` quiescent ' in terms of their nuclear luminosities .",
    "( orientation and obscuration effects will play some role although are unlikely to modify this conclusion di matteo 2001 , 2003 ; allen , di matteo & fabian 2000 . )",
    "it is interesting to note that the measured jet powers are comparable to the bolometric luminosities predicted by standard , radiatively efficient accretion disk models with @xmath88 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "thus , it is possible that the ratio of accretion rate / total emitted power ( bolometric luminosity plus jet power ) may remain relatively stable as the accretion mode varies from a quasar to optically quiescent phase .",
    "our results have significant implications for models of galaxy formation and support the idea that feedback from central black holes is important in shaping the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function ( see croton 2005 and bower 2005 for recent discussions ) . for our sample ,",
    "the @xmath89 efficiency with which energy associated with the rest mass of accreted matter is fed back into the surrounding x - ray emitting gas via the jets is similar to that @xmath90 in the semi - analytic models of croton ( 2005 ) .",
    "those models have been shown to be able to explain the exponential cut off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function and the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge dominated systems in clusters , containing systematically older stars .",
    "our results show that the supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies are prodigious energy sources , with the bulk of the energy emerging in the form of relativistic jets rather than radiation . in order for this energy to be coupled back into the surrounding matter , the jets must have a working surface which is provided in these cases by the x - ray emitting gas . for the elliptical galaxies studied here , the power fed back into the x - ray emitting gas",
    "is , in principle , sufficient to offset cooling and heat the gas , thereby preventing further star formation .",
    "( note that best 2006 apply simple scaling arguments to a large elliptical galaxy sample to show that the time - averaged power output from radio sources can , in principle , balance radiative cooling . )",
    "since we expect all large galaxies to contain a supermassive black hole , even at high redshifts , this suggests that a key stage in the formation of such galaxies will be when they first become large enough to maintain an x - ray gaseous halo .",
    "( this then provides a working surface for the jets , allowing feedback and preventing further galaxy growth .",
    "although the jets could have been providing power before this point , they are unlikely to have had an effective working surface . ) note , however , that although star formation is truncated when jet feedback becomes efficient , the black hole may continue to grow via accretion from the x - ray gas at approximately the bondi rate .",
    "a closely related topic is that of cooling flows in galaxies and clusters , and the mechanism responsible for preventing gas cooling to low temperatures ( @xmath91kev ) . as stated above",
    ", the @xmath8 values in the galaxies and groups studied here are sufficient to offset further cooling of the x - ray gas .",
    "it is interesting to consider extending the correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath8 to larger systems where the cooling of the gas is more rapid .",
    "for the largest cooling flow clusters , the cooling luminosity exceeds @xmath92 .",
    "if the black hole masses and accretion rates in these galaxies are not significantly larger than in ngc507 and m87 , then the jet power is unlikely to be sufficient to balance cooling and some cooling to very low temperatures and associated star formation can be expected to occur ( see also fabian 2002 ) .",
    "this is consistent with observations indicating the presence of vigorous star formation and large molecular gas concentrations in the largest cooling flow clusters , but relatively little in less x - ray luminous systems ( mcnamara & oconnell 1992 ; allen 1995 ; crawford 1999 ; edge 2001 ) .    finally , we note that although systematic uncertainties have been included in the extrapolation of the gas properties to the bondi radii and in our estimation of black hole masses and bubble volumes , other sources of systematic uncertainty remain . for example ,",
    "the assumption that @xmath93 in the calculation of @xmath6 may not be precise , and our assumption that the bubble ages can be estimated as @xmath54 is probably uncertain at the factor @xmath46 level .",
    "however , we do not expect such uncertainties to affect the main conclusions drawn here .",

    "<S> using chandra x - ray observations of nine nearby , x - ray luminous elliptical galaxies with good optical velocity dispersion measurements , we show that a tight correlation exists between the bondi accretion rates calculated from the observed gas temperature and density profiles and estimated black hole masses , and the power emerging from these systems in relativistic jets . </S>",
    "<S> the jet powers , which are inferred from the energies and timescales required to inflate cavities observed in the surrounding x - ray emitting gas , can be related to the accretion rates using a power law model of the form log(@xmath0log(@xmath1 , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that a significant fraction of the energy associated with the rest mass of material entering the bondi accretion radius ( @xmath4 per cent , for @xmath5 ) eventually emerges in the relativistic jets . </S>",
    "<S> the data also hint that this fraction may rise slightly with increasing jet power . </S>",
    "<S> our results have significant implications for studies of accretion , jet formation and galaxy formation . </S>",
    "<S> the observed tight correlation suggests that the bondi formulae provide a reasonable description of the accretion process in these systems , despite the likely presence of magnetic pressure and angular momentum in the accreting gas . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 values argues that a significant fraction of the matter entering the accretion radius flows down to regions close to the black holes , where the jets are presumably formed . </S>",
    "<S> the tight correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath8 also suggests that the accretion flows are approximately stable over timescales of a few million years . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the black hole ` engines ' at the hearts of large elliptical galaxies and groups can feed back sufficient energy to stem cooling and star formation , leading naturally to the observed exponential cut off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function .    # 1to 0pt#1 = \" 2218 # 1 # 1    to size    # 1    to size       = cmr10 scaled2 = cmbx10 scaled2 = cmti10 scaled2 ps .    = -1.5 cm    accretion , accretion disks  black hole physics  </S>",
