    "v836 tau is an interesting young star with properties that are between those of classical and weak t tauri stars .",
    "its optical spectrum displays relatively weak , variable h@xmath3 emission , with measured equivalent widths in the range 125  ( white & hillenbrand 2004 ; beristain , edwards , & kwan 2001 ; kenyon et al .  1998 ; wolk & walter 1996 ; mundt et al .  1983 ) .",
    "similarly , v836 tau also shows little veiling and has one of the smallest measured stellar accretion rates among t tauri stars ( hartigan , edwards , & ghandour 1995 ) . nevertheless , the detection of h@xmath3 emission with an inverse p cygni profile ( wolk & walter 1996 ) demonstrates the continued , possibly intermittent , accretion of material onto the star .",
    "millimeter wavelength co emission has also been detected from v836 tau ( duvert et al .",
    "2000 ) despite the relatively low disk mass @xmath4 inferred from the submillimeter dust continuum properties ( e.g. , andrews & williams 2005 ) .    at infrared wavelengths",
    ", v836 shows little or no excess in the @xmath5- and @xmath6-bands , but a much stronger excess indicative of an optically thick disk is apparent beyond 10@xmath7 ( strom et al .",
    "1989 ; skrutskie et al .",
    "1990 ; padgett et al .",
    "2006 ) . interpreting the unusual spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and low stellar accretion rate of v836 tau as indications that the system is on the verge of dissipating its disk , strom et al .",
    "( 1989 ) consequently referred to v836 tau as a `` transitional t tauri star '' , a term reflecting the view that classical t tauri stars evolve into weak t tauri stars with the dissipation of the disk playing a central role in that evolutionary process .",
    "more generally , transition objects , systems that can be modeled as an optically thick disk that has an optically thin region ( a hole or a gap ) at smaller radii , have been suggested to be in the process of dissipating their disks from the inside - out ( strom et al .",
    "1989 ; skrutskie et al .",
    "1990 ) , possibly as a result of the formation of planetesimals ( strom et al .",
    "1989 ) , a giant planetary companion ( e.g. , skrutskie et al .  1990 ) , disk photoevaporation ( clarke et al .  2001 ; alexander et al .",
    "2006 ) , or potentially other processes .",
    "we report here on the properties of the 4.7@xmath7 co fundamental ( @xmath8=1 ) emission from v836 tau to see whether it can provide any insights into the extent and nature of disk dissipation in the system .",
    "co fundamental emission has been previously characterized as a probe of circumstellar disk gas ( najita et al .",
    "2003 , 2007a ; blake & boogert 2004 ; brittain et al .",
    "2007 ) . in the case of disks surrounding low mass stars ,",
    "co fundamental emission is estimated to arise from within @xmath9au of the star ( najita et al .",
    "2003 ) . as a result ,",
    "the emission is well - suited to probing the radial distribution of gas in the terrestrial planet region of the disk .",
    "recent thermal - chemical models of the inner regions of disks surrounding low mass stars suggest that the co emission arises from the warm surface region of the disk that is heated by stellar ( x - ray ) irradiation and possibly mechanical heating processes ( e.g. , glassgold et al .",
    "the co fundamental emission from v836 tau was discussed briefly in an earlier study ( najita et al .",
    "2003 ) . here",
    "we report a new , higher signal - to - noise observation of the co emission , which we use to characterize the radial distribution of the gas in inner @xmath1012au of the disk surrounding v836 tau .",
    "we obtained a high - resolution ( @xmath11=25,000 ) spectrum of v836 tau on the night of 2003 january 11 at the w.m .",
    "keck observatory using nirspec ( mclean et al .",
    "1998 ) in echelle mode with a 0.43@xmath12 slit .",
    "our spectral setup included two echelle orders covering the spectral ranges @xmath13 m ( in order 16 ) and @xmath14 m ( in order 15 ) .",
    "these wavelength regions include low-@xmath15 co @xmath16=10 r - branch transitions in order 16 and high-@xmath15 co @xmath16=10 p - branch transitions in order 15 .",
    "observations at @xmath17 m are dominated by strong thermal background continuum and telluric emission lines . in order to remove these features ,",
    "the telescope was nodded in an abba pattern at 2 minute intervals between two positions in the slit separated by 12@xmath18 . during our observations , the seeing varied between @xmath100.6@xmath12 and @xmath101.1@xmath12 mainly as a result of high wind . as a result , the total effective integration time on the source was 40 minutes . in addition , fixed pattern noise on the left two quadrants of the detector increased the noise in these quadrants by a factor of @xmath101.5 relative to the noise on the right side of the array .",
    "this reduced the signal - to - noise ratio in the short - wavelength half of each order .",
    "all data reduction procedures were carried out using iraf .",
    "subsequent images were subtracted from each other , removing the background and telluric emission lines to first order .",
    "a flat field correction was applied to each differenced image . to minimize the impact of imperfectly cancelled telluric emission lines on the extracted spectrum",
    ", we rectified the images so that the image of the slit ran vertically along pixel columns .",
    "the required geometric transformation was obtained from the original pattern of telluric emission lines using the iraf tasks fitcoords and transform .",
    "individual differenced images were average combined and one - dimensional spectra were extracted for each nod position and order . because the spectra had been rectified , large background apertures ( located on both sides of the source aperture ) could be used in extracting the spectrum , producing a higher signal - to - noise spectrum .",
    "telluric absorption features were removed by dividing the program spectrum by that of a telluric standard ( the hot star hr 1605 ; spectral type a8 ) , which was obtained and reduced in the same way as the v836 tau spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of hr 1605 was mostly featureless except for absorption in the 75 pf@xmath19 line .",
    "consequently , the divided spectrum has artificially enhanced hydrogen emission in this region . to correct for the difference in airmass between the object and the standard spectra",
    ", we used the iraf task telluric to perform the division .",
    "telluric absorption lines were used for the wavelength calibration .",
    "an approximate flux calibration was obtained by acquiring additional spectra of both v836 tau and hr1605 with the 0.72@xmath12 nirspec slit .",
    "given the poor seeing , slit losses are likely to have been significant .",
    "the short integrations used for the v836 tau observations result in a formal 1-@xmath20 error of 25% in the flux calibration of each order .",
    "the possibility of slit losses contributes additional uncertainty in the flux .",
    "nevertheless , the resulting continuum fluxes for each order agree to @xmath21% with the @xmath22 spitzer / irac flux reported for v836 tau ( padgett et al .  2006 ; [ @xmath23 jy ] ) .",
    "for comparison , our calibrated continuum flux of 0.128 jy , the average of the continuum level in orders 15 and 16 , is @xmath24% brighter than the value of @xmath25 jy that we reported previously for v836 tau in the same wavelength region based on nirspec data taken in 2001 ( najita et al .",
    "it is also 30% fainter than the 0.18 jy continuum flux at @xmath26 that is implied by extrapolating the spitzer / irs spectrum of v836 tau ( furlan et al .",
    "2006 ) to that wavelength . because of the relatively large uncertainty in the flux calibration for each order , we are unable to determine if there is a shallow continuum slope between the two orders .",
    "we therefore adopted the continuum flux slope measured by furlan et al .   and scaled the flux so that the average of the continuum fluxes at the wavelength centers of orders 15 and 16 agrees with our measured average value .",
    "we also acquired on 2004 november 23 similar nirspec spectra of the k5v star 61 cyg a. these spectra were used in calibrating synthetic models of the stellar photospheric contribution to the v836 tau spectrum ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "the data were reduced and wavelength calibrated with the same procedure used for the v836 tau data .",
    "the resulting co fundamental spectrum is of significantly higher signal - to - noise than our previously reported spectrum of v836 tau ( najita et al .  2003 ) .",
    "in the earlier spectrum , co emission was clearly detected , but the shape of the line profile was unclear and the properties of the emission were unusual .",
    "the line widths of the low-@xmath15 r lines were found to be significantly narrower than the widths of the high-@xmath15 p lines ( @xmath27 compared to @xmath28 ) .",
    "in addition , the emission at @xmath29 appeared to peak at a radial velocity redward of the stellar velocity .",
    "a comparison with the new spectrum shows that this was because the blue component of the low-@xmath15 profiles was not recovered in the earlier data , a result of our limited ability to correct for telluric absorption given the lower signal - to - noise of the earlier data .",
    "the new , higher signal - to - noise data show @xmath16=10 emission that is double - peaked in both the @xmath29 and @xmath30 regions ( fig .  1 and 2 , respectively , top panels ) and centered at the radial velocity of the star .",
    "the emission equivalent width is comparable to that in the earlier spectrum .",
    "the double - peaked line profiles of the co @xmath16=10 emission from v836 tau are unusual in that the majority of classical t tauri stars that have been studied to date show co @xmath16=10 line profiles that are centrally peaked ( najita et al .",
    "2003 ) . for emission arising in a disk , double - peaked profiles",
    "indicate that the emission arises from a limited range of disk radii .",
    "for example , this is the interpretation given to the double - peaked @xmath31 co overtone ( @xmath8=2 ) emission lines that are observed from actively accreting young stars ( e.g. , wl 16 , dg tau ; carr et al .",
    "1993 ; najita et al .",
    "1996 , 2000 ) .",
    "because the observed spectrum is a composite of the emission from the star and disk , some fraction of the central dip in the co line profile may result from absorption in the stellar photospheric component .",
    "we estimated the stellar contribution to the spectrum using the recent version of the stellar spectral synthesis program moog ( sneden 1973 ) .",
    "as inputs , we used the nextgen model atmospheres ( hauschildt et al.1999 ) and the co linelist of goorvitch ( 1994 ) . the ability to fit the co spectrum in this wavelength region",
    "was verified on a spectrum of the k5 dwarf 61 cyg a , which was obtained with the same instrumental setup as the spectrum of v836 tau . for our adopted stellar parameters for 61 cyg a ( @xmath32k , @xmath33 ) and near - solar metallicities",
    ", we obtain an excellent fit to the spectrum .",
    "in contrast , with the atmospheric models of kurucz ( 1993 ) , it is not possible to match the relative strengths of the weak and strong co lines .",
    "we selected an atmosphere model that is appropriate for the stellar photospheric temperature ( @xmath34k ) and gravity ( @xmath35 ) that are implied by the stellar effective temperature and luminosity of v836 tau measured by white & hillenbrand ( 2004 ) .",
    "we adopted a solar metallicity , as appropriate for the taurus star forming region ( padgett 1996 ; santos et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "a comparison of the synthetic stellar spectrum and the observed spectrum of v836 tau shows that much of the structure in the continuum is due to absorption features in the stellar photosphere ( figs .  1 and 2 , top panels ) .",
    "stellar photospheric features are expected to be detectable in high signal - to - noise spectra given the weak near - infrared excess of v836 tau .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath36 ( which corresponds to a topocentric velocity of @xmath37 ) and the stellar rotational velocity of @xmath38 measured by white & hillenbrand ( 2004 ) are in agreement with the stellar photospheric features identified in the observed spectrum .",
    "these parameters , combined with a continuum veiling of @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 is the ratio of the excess flux to the stellar photospheric flux at @xmath0 ) , provides a reasonably good fit to the observed spectrum .",
    "the depth of the co absorption in the veiled stellar photospheric spectrum shows that some of the central absorption in the observed co emission profile arises from co absorption in the stellar photosphere .",
    "the measured veiling has two sources of uncertainty .",
    "the low signal - to - noise of the spectrum introduces uncertainty in the location of the continuum , contributing an uncertainty of @xmath41 to the veiling measurement . the uncertainty in the stellar effective temperature",
    "( @xmath42k ) and @xmath43 ( @xmath41 ) of v836 tau ( see  3.3 ) contributes an additional uncertainty of @xmath44 to the veiling .",
    "figure  3 shows the dereddened sed of v836 tau .",
    "we constructed the sed from the @xmath45 photometry of kenyon & hartmann ( 1995 ) , the @xmath46 fluxes from 2mass , and the _ spitzer _ irac and mips photometry reported by padgett et al .",
    "the fluxes were dereddened using the reddening law of mathis ( 1990 ) assuming @xmath47 as in furlan et al .",
    "a basel stellar atmosphere v2.2 ( corrected ; lejeune 2002 ) with @xmath48k and @xmath35 provides a good fit to the dereddened optical colors of the star .",
    "the stellar contribution as shown is roughly consistent with the minimal veiling at @xmath11 and @xmath49 measured by white & hillenbrand ( 2004 ) .",
    "overall , the sed is approximately photospheric below @xmath50 with a significant infrared excess beyond that wavelength .",
    "our measured veiling of @xmath39 is consistent with values that are implied by the stellar photospheric contribution to the sed shown in figure 3 and photometric measurements of v836 tau in the literature . for consistency with the stellar photospheric contribution to the sed",
    ", our veiling requires a continuum flux of @xmath51",
    "jy at the time our spectrum was obtained , which is within the level of uncertainty in our flux calibration .      to obtain the disk contribution to the co fundamental spectrum , we subtracted the veiled stellar photosphere from the observed spectrum ( figs.1 and 2 , bottom panels ) .",
    "the difference spectrum shows that even after accounting for stellar photospheric absorption , the residual co emission spectrum has a double - peaked line profile .",
    "we can better define the line profile by averaging multiple co emission lines to improve the signal - to - noise of the line profile . in constructing an average line profile , regions of poor telluric correction ( below a cutoff value of 9095% transmission )",
    "were excluded from the average .",
    "the regions to exclude were determined from the observations of the telluric standard .",
    "the average profiles of the low-@xmath15 r and high-@xmath15 p lines are shown in figures 4 and 5 ( solid black lines ) , respectively . in these figures ,",
    "the individual lines that contribute to the average are shown as histograms .",
    "the points that are included in the average are indicated by asterisks .",
    "the distribution of the asterisks shows that many of the deviant points are excluded by the weighting scheme , as desired .",
    "for both the low-@xmath15 r and high-@xmath15 p lines , the average line profile indicates that the co emission extends to approximately @xmath52 .",
    "the location of the `` horns '' of the profile ( at approximately @xmath53 ) further indicates that the co emission arises from a limited range of disk radii ( @xmath54 ) .      to estimate the range of disk radii from which the emission originates and the excitation conditions therein , we modeled the residual ( stellar photosphere - subtracted ) co emission using a simple model of emission from a gaseous disk under the assumption of keplerian rotation and thermal level populations ( e.g. , carr et al .  1993 ;",
    "najita et al .",
    "given the estimated extinction of @xmath47 ( furlan et al .",
    "2006 ) we assumed a negligible extinction at @xmath0 . for simplicity , no underlying continuum was assumed in fitting the line emission .",
    "this is reasonable given our limited goal of estimating the radial extent of the emitting gas .",
    "an important model parameter is the stellar mass .",
    "we can estimate the stellar mass of v836 tau both from pre - main - sequence evolutionary tracks and from available dynamical mass estimates of pre - main - sequence stars of the same spectral type and similar age .",
    "the k7 @xmath55 spectral type ( or t@xmath56k ; white & hillenbrand 2004 ) corresponds to a mass of @xmath57 using the evolutionary tracks of siess et al .",
    "similarly , other t tauri stars in taurus with k7 spectral types have measured dynamical masses ( simon et al .",
    "2000 ) of @xmath58 ( dl tau ) and @xmath59 ( gm aur ) .",
    "thus , the k7 dynamical masses and hr diagram position of v836 tau are consistent with a stellar mass of @xmath60 .",
    "if the spectral type is larger or smaller by one subclass , a larger range in mass is allowed ( @xmath61 ) . here , we assume a stellar mass of @xmath62 .",
    "an additional model parameter is the system inclination , which we can obtain from the stellar rotation period @xmath63 of @xmath64 days determined from long - term monitoring ( grankin et al .",
    "2008 ) , the projected stellar rotational velocity @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ; white & hillenbrand 2004 ) , and the stellar radius @xmath67 these are related by @xmath68 the stellar radius can be estimated from the measured stellar luminosity and temperature .",
    "the stellar luminosity , obtained by integrating the stellar component in the sed fit ( fig .  3",
    "; see also furlan et al .",
    "2006 ) , is @xmath69 at the average taurus distance of 140pc , with a range of @xmath70 if we account for the range in distances ( @xmath71pc ) derived to individual taurus objects ( bertout & genova 2006 ) . for @xmath72k , @xmath73 where the uncertainty in the stellar temperature dominates the error on the low luminosity end , and the uncertainty in the distance dominates the error on the high luminosity end .",
    "an examination of all of the uncertainties in the above properties gives a possible inclination range of @xmath74 degrees . since v836 tau does not have the extreme colors of an edge - on disk system ( e.g , dalessio et al .",
    "2006 ) , we assume a more modest inclination of 65 degrees for the modeling .    with these constraints on the stellar mass and system inclination , we can then infer the range of disk radii over which the emission arises assuming keplerian rotation .",
    "the maximum velocity extent of the @xmath16=10 co emission lines ( @xmath75 ; see sec .",
    "3.2 ) and the inclination range of @xmath76 degrees implies an inner radius of @xmath77 au for the emitting gas .",
    "this range of @xmath78 is consistent with the values of @xmath78 measured for classical t tauri stars using co emission line profiles ( najita et al .",
    "2007a ; carr 2007 ) .",
    "the overall shape of the emission line profile further suggests that the emission extends out to a radius @xmath79 , significantly less than the @xmath80 that would be inferred from the centrally peaked co fundamental emission profiles of most t tauri stars ( najita et al .",
    "thus , the outer radius of the v836 tau co emission is in the range @xmath81au .",
    "we can provide constraints on the mean conditions in the emitting gas by modeling the co spectrum with a radially constant excitation temperature and column density .",
    "the similar shape and strength of the @xmath16=10 emission lines over a wide range in @xmath15 reveals that the emission lines are optically thick , i.e. , that the gas column density is @xmath82 if turbulent line broadening is negligible .",
    "in addition , the absence of detectable @xmath16=10 @xmath83co emission lines limits the column density to @xmath84 for a co abundance of @xmath85 relative to hydrogen and an interstellar @xmath83co/@xmath86co ratio of 90 .",
    "the weakness of the @xmath16=21 and @xmath16=32 lines in the spectrum requires either a low average excitation temperature or that the vibrational levels above @xmath16=1 depart significantly from thermal equilibrium .",
    "for lte level populations , the relative strengths of the @xmath16=10 lines and the limit on the strength of the @xmath16=21 transitions constrain the mean excitation temperature to the range 7001100k .",
    "smaller excitation temperatures require larger emitting areas to produce the required line flux , as well as larger inclinations in order to produce the emission over the required range of velocities . as a result , at temperatures @xmath87k , the requirement on the line flux drives the emitting radii to values large enough that the required velocities can not be obtained at any inclination . for a radially constant excitation temperature @xmath88k ,",
    "the @xmath16=2 - 1 lines are too strong relative to the @xmath16=10 lines .",
    "in addition , given the constraints on the radial range ( and therefore the emitting area ) of the emission , the strength of the @xmath16=10 lines are overpredicted at such high temperatures .",
    "we can obtain a better fit to the average line profiles by allowing the temperature to vary as a function of radius .",
    "consistent with the above considerations , a gas temperature that varies slowly with radius ( @xmath89 ) and a line - of - sight disk column density of @xmath90 that is radially constant between @xmath91 and @xmath92 , gives a reasonable fit to the spectra assuming lte level populations ( fig .",
    "in addition to providing a reasonable fit to the relative line strengths of the @xmath16=10 lines , the model also reasonably fits the average line profiles of the @xmath16=10 lines ( figs .  4 and 5 ; heavy dashed line ) .",
    "we can also fit the spectra with a model that uses a steep temperature gradient rather than a specified outer radius to limit the radial extent of the emission . with a temperature profile @xmath93 and a radially - constant line - of - sight column density @xmath94 and @xmath95 ,",
    "the 10 emission decreases sharply beyond @xmath96 because the planck function contributes little at @xmath0 at the low temperatures achieved at these radii ( @xmath97k ) .",
    "the high-@xmath15 p - branch lines are also optically thin at these radii .",
    "the model provides a reasonable fit to the relative strengths of the @xmath16=10 lines .",
    "the average line profiles are reasonably well fit ( figs .  4 and 5 ; heavy dash - dot line ) , although the central dip in the @xmath16=10 r lines is shallower than observed .",
    "this is because the low-@xmath15 r lines remain optically thick ( and continue to produce emission ) to larger radii than the high-@xmath15 p lines .",
    "in contrast , the outer radius to the emission used in the first model , produces similar line profiles for the low-@xmath15 r and high-@xmath15 p lines .    to summarize , the observed spectra can be explained with an abrupt truncation of the co emission beyond an outer radius of @xmath96 .",
    "a steep temperature gradient where the temperature drops to @xmath97k at @xmath98 is an alternative explanation .",
    "note that there is a slight inconsistency in the model parameters used in the above fits .",
    "the adopted inclination formally implies a distance of 165pc rather than the nominal taurus distance of 140pc that we have assumed in the fits . if v836 tau is located at a larger distance than 140pc , the co emission can be fit with similar model parameters to those used above , with the modification that @xmath99 and the emission arises from radii 1.18 times larger than assumed above .",
    "the higher mass is within the mass range allowed by the uncertainty in the stellar spectral type .",
    "the co emission from v836 tau shows similarly double - peaked line profiles for lines spanning a large range in excitation temperature .",
    "the line profile shapes indicate that the co emission is truncated beyond @xmath100au .",
    "the similarity in the relative strengths of the 10 transitions show that the 10 transitions are optically thick over the emitting region .",
    "as described in the previous section , these properties could be produced by a _ physical _ truncation of the gaseous disk beyond a radius of @xmath100au or a truncation of the co emission ( but not the disk gas column density ) at the same radius .",
    "although it is difficult to determine which of these interpretations is correct based on the available information , some possibilities can be ruled out .",
    "for example , the truncation of the co emission is unlikely to result from the thermal dissociation of co since the excitation temperature of the gas is much less than the thermal dissocation temperature of co ( @xmath101k at the densities of inner disks ) .",
    "we might also consider the possible explanations that have been put forward for the origin of the double - peaked line profiles observed in the @xmath16=20 co overtone bandhead emission from t tauri stars and herbig ae stars at @xmath31 ( e.g. , carr et al .",
    "1993 ; najita et al .",
    "1996 , 2000 ) .",
    "such emission is detected only from sources with high accretion rates , probably a consequence of the temperatures and high column densities that are needed to produce the overtone emission .",
    "since these systems have disks that are believed to be radially continuous , the double - peaked lines are unlikely to arise from a radially truncated disk .",
    "we have previously described two possible explanations for the double - peaked lines that make up the co @xmath16=20 bandhead : ( 1 ) the outer radius is a dust sublimation front , or ( 2 ) the transition from atomic h to h@xmath102 at decreasing temperature depopulates the higher co vibrational levels .    in the first scenario ,",
    "a dust sublimation front renders the line emitting layer optically thick in the continuum at temperatures below @xmath103k , eliminating the contrast of the co @xmath16=20 emission above the continuum at these radii ( e.g. , carr 1989 ) .",
    "this explanation is difficult to apply to the co fundamental lines , because typical dust temperatures at the inferred outer radius of @xmath100au for the co fundamental emission are much below the dust sublimation temperature ( e.g. , dalessio et al .",
    "1999 ) and measured dust sublimation radii are much smaller than the inferred outer radius of the co fundamental emission ( eisner et al .  2005 ; muzerolle et al .",
    "therefore , the outer radius observed for the co fundamental emission is unlikely to result from dust sublimation .    as an alternative scenario",
    ", we previously speculated that the transition from atomic to molecular hydrogen at decreasing disk temperature leads to the depopulation of the higher vibrational levels of co due to the lower collisional cross - section of molecular hydrogen with co compared to that of atomic hydrogen with co ( najita et al .",
    "1996 ) . in chemical equilibrium",
    ", disks would transition from a mixture of co and atomic hydrogen at small disk radii ( @xmath104k ) to a mixture of co and molecular hydrogen at large disk radii ( @xmath105k ) .",
    "in this situation , we estimated that radiative trapping would be able to maintain the @xmath106 vibrational populations down to a temperature of @xmath103k , below which significant depopulation would occur . using a non - lte model of this kind",
    ", we were able to reproduce the line intensities and shapes of co overtone emission lines covering a wide range of excitation conditions ( @xmath16=20 to @xmath16=53 ) in the spectra of two herbig ae stars .",
    "the same effect is unlikely to apply in detail to the truncation of the co fundamental emission seen in v836 tau ( @xmath107au ) .",
    "while chemical equilibrium may be relevant at the large column densities needed to produce the overtone emission , disks are expected to have significant vertical structure and to depart significantly from chemical equilibrium at the smaller column densities needed to produce the fundamental emission .",
    "thermal - chemical models of t tauri disks irradiated by stellar x - rays ( glassgold et al .  2004 ; meijerink et al .",
    "2008 ) indicate that overlying the large column densities where the overtone lines form is a warm surface layer that is expected to be conducive to the production of co fundamental emission over a large range in radii ( glassgold et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the x - ray irradiated disk models , which have currently studied the structure of disks over the region 0.252au , find that throughout this range of radii disks possess a warm ( @xmath108k ) surface layer ( @xmath109 ) of co mixed with atomic hydrogen ( glassgold et al .",
    "2004 ; meijerink et al .",
    "thus , the co fundamental transitions could plausibly be excited over radii within and beyond 1au .",
    "this expectation is in agreement with observations of co fundamental emission from t tauri stars .",
    "empirically , we find that almost all accreting t tauri stars show co fundamental emission and that the majority of co fundamental emission profiles are centrally peaked .",
    "this indicates that the emission arises from a wide range of disk radii ( @xmath110 , @xmath111au ) , without a sharp truncation in excitation as a function of velocity ( najita et al .",
    "2003 ) .    however , it is possible that these general trends , obtained for typical t tauri stars , do not apply to v836 tau .",
    "whereas typical t tauri stars have strong near - infrared excesses and stellar accretion rates @xmath112 , v836 tau has a weak near - infrared excess and a low stellar accretion rate @xmath113 ( hartigan et al .",
    "1995 scaled to gullbring et al .",
    "1998 ; herczeg et al .",
    "the weak near - infrared excess might indicate either a significant settling of grains out of the disk atmosphere or a lack of dust at small disk radii .",
    "in this situation , one might imagine that a lack of small grains could reduce the heating of the gaseous atmosphere , if gas - grain collisions dominate the heating of the gaseous disk . in a cooler atmosphere ,",
    "vibrational co emission would be more difficult to produce , perhaps contributing , thereby , to the truncation of the co emission .",
    "this does not seem likely in the context of recent x - ray irradiated disk atmosphere models , in which the gas is heated directly by x - rays or accretion - related processes and the grains function primarily as a coolant for the gas through collisions .",
    "in such a model , we might expect grain growth and settling to produce warmer gaseous atmospheres , rather than a radial truncation of the co emission .",
    "alternatively , one might imagine that co might be less abundant in a grain - poor disk atmosphere if the co is synthesized from h@xmath102 that forms on grains .",
    "however , in the x - ray irradiated disk atmosphere models , the grains are typically warmer than 100k within 1au , and have therefore been assumed to play no significant role in the synthesis of co and other molecules ( glassgold et al .",
    "2004 ) . as a result",
    ", grain growth and settling is not expected to significantly reduce the strength of the co emission from the disk atmosphere .",
    "another possibility is that the low accretion rate of v836 tau compared to the average t tauri accretion rate ( @xmath112 ; hartmann et al .",
    "1998 ) might play a role in truncating the co emission . since accretion - related processes may heat the gaseous atmosphere ( glassgold et al .",
    "2004 ) , the gaseous atmosphere may experience reduced heating at the lower accretion rate of v836 tau .",
    "while the available heating is clearly able to produce detectable @xmath16=10 co fundamental emission from v836 tau , could reduced heating radially truncate the emission , perhaps via a non - lte effect ?    a simple estimate indicates that the vibrational populations could be in non - lte .",
    "the critical density @xmath114 for the @xmath16=1 level of co , obtained from the einstein a - values for the @xmath16=10 transitions ( e.g. , goorvitch & chackerian 1994 ) and the @xmath16=10 collision rates for co with atomic hydrogen ( glass & kironde 1983 ) , varies as @xmath115 and equals @xmath116 at a temperature of 1000k ( see discussion in najita et al .",
    "our modeling of the co emission from v836 tau shows that the @xmath16=10 co emission arises from a gas column density @xmath117 at disk radii @xmath118 au . in the dalessio et al .",
    "( 1999 ) disk model , the density in the disk atmosphere over this range of column density is @xmath119 at radii 0.10.4 au .",
    "therefore , a rough estimate is @xmath120 in the co emitting region .",
    "our modeling of the co emission further shows that the @xmath16=10 co lines are optically thick , with @xmath121 .",
    "since the escape probability for gaussian lines depends asymptotically on the line optical depth as @xmath122 ( mihalas 1978 ) , the line optical depth approximately compensates for the low value of @xmath123 so that the @xmath124 level could be in lte .",
    "the situation for the higher vibrational levels is possibly similar , with the critical densities for these levels being comparable to the critical density for @xmath16=1 .",
    "this because the a - values of the higher vibrational levels are larger ( proportional to @xmath16 ) , but the collision rates may also be larger because of the contribution from @xmath125 collisions ( a. glassgold , personal communication ) .",
    "thus , the co vibrational level populations could plausibly be in lte , consistent with the assumption made in  3.3 .",
    "however , both lower temperatures and lower densities in the co emitting region will tend to drive departures from lte .",
    "reduced accretion heating can produce both lower temperatures and lower densities .",
    "as the accretion heating is reduced , the vertical temperature inversion that puts the co into emission will become increasing limited to the lower column density surface region that can be heated by external irradiation ( e.g. , by stellar x - rays ) .",
    "this surface region will be characterized by lower densities .",
    "detailed calculations of the thermal , chemical , and density structure of disk atmospheres are needed to address this issue quantitatively .",
    "because such calculations are currently lacking , we might take instead a more empirical approach and compare the co fundamental line profiles of v836 tau with those of other t tauri stars with low stellar accretion rates and/or low near - infrared excesses . as an example of such a comparison ,",
    "figure 7 ( top panel ) shows the co fundamental emission from lkca15 , a t tauri star with a stellar accretion rate similar to that of v836 tau ( hartmann et al .  1998 ; see also najita , strom , & muzerolle 2007b ) .",
    "the spectrum shows the data reported in najita et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , but re - reduced using the approach described in  2 .",
    "the @xmath16=10 co emission from lkca15 is centered at the stellar velocity ( short vertical lines , bottom panel ) , but compared to v836 tau , it shows a centrally peaked profile .",
    "although the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectrum is limited , weak stellar photospheric features appear to be present . in the bottom panel of figure 7",
    ", we show the co emission from lkca15 after correction for a stellar photospheric contribution , following the approach described in  3.1 .",
    "the stellar photospheric model assumes an allard stellar atmosphere model with a gravity of @xmath35 , an effective temperature of 4400k to match the k5 spectral type of lkca15 ( herbig & bell 1988 ) , a stellar rotational velocity @xmath126 ( hartmann , soderblom , & stauffer 1987 ) , and an observed ( topocentric ) radial velocity of @xmath127 , which is appropriate for the measured stellar radial velocity ( hartmann et al .",
    "1987 ) and the observation date .",
    "a veiling of 2.5 times the stellar continuum roughly reproduces the strength of the stellar photospheric features near the 10 p30 line .",
    "this level of veiling is also consistent with the veiling at @xmath128 implied by the sed ( e.g. , furlan et al .",
    "subtracting the veiled stellar photospheric component produces a disk co emission profile that is even more centrally peaked ( fig .  7 , bottom panel ) .",
    "in addition to its low stellar accretion rate , lkca15 is also similar to v836 tau in that it has the characteristics of a transition object with a weak near - infrared continuum and an optically thick outer disk ( e.g. , bergin et al .",
    "2004 ; espaillat et al .",
    "its properties therefore probe empirically how both the reduction in small grains and reduced accretion - related heating might affect the co fundamental emission from the disk .",
    "the lkca15 spectrum shows that in at least some cases , these effects do not radially truncate the co fundamental emission within 1 au .    to summarize",
    ", the double - peaked line profile of the co fundamental emission from v836 tau may indicate that the gaseous disk extends from close to the star ( @xmath129au ) out to a physical truncation radius ( @xmath100au ) .",
    "if the gaseous disk in v836 tau is instead continuous beyond this radius , the double - peaked co profile would indicate a sudden truncation of the co emission beyond a radius of 0.4au . as discussed in  4.2 , an abrupt decrement in excitation",
    "is not expected empirically , since the majority of co emission profiles observed to date ( both typical classical t tauri stars and transition objects like lkca15 ) show centrally peaked co profiles with no comparable decrement in excitation with radius .",
    "however , a truncated emission profile may result from either an ( anomalously ) steep temperature gradient or departures from lte that become important in low accretion rate systems .",
    "these two possible explanations can be explored and potentially distinguished with a higher signal - to - noise spectrum that measures the strengths of the @xmath16=21 lines .",
    "a theoretical study of the possibility of non - lte co level populations would also be welcome in sorting out whether an excitation effect is a possible explanation for the outer radius of the emission .",
    "additional observations of low accretion rate sources would be useful in exploring this issue empirically .",
    "most definitive of all would be observations of spectral line transitions that robustly probe the disk atmosphere of v836 tau at excitation temperatures @xmath130k .",
    "these observations would complement the insensitivity of the co fundamental transitions to low temperature gas .",
    "if little emission is detected with these diagnostics at disk radii @xmath131au , that would strongly suggest that the gaseous inner disk in v836 tau is physically truncated at @xmath100au .",
    "some of the mid - infrared molecular emission diagnostics recently reported in the spectrum of aa tau ( c@xmath102h@xmath102 , hcn , h@xmath102o , oh ; carr & najita 2008 ) may prove useful in this regard .",
    "the possibility that the disk of v836 tau is physically truncated beyond 0.4au may bear on our understanding of the nature of the system .",
    "as noted in  1 , v836 tau has been previously classified as a transition object ( strom et al .",
    "1989 ) , a system with an optically thin inner disk ( within @xmath132 ) and an optically thick outer disk ( beyond @xmath132 ) .",
    "the seds of these systems have been variously explained as a consequence of grain growth and planetesimal formation ( e.g. , strom et al .",
    "1989 ; dullemond & dominik 2005 ) , giant planet formation ( e.g. , skrutskie et al .  1990 ; marsh & mahoney 1992 ) , or photoevaporation ( e.g. , clarke et al .  2001 ; alexander et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "while all of these processes can produce optically thin regions in the disk ( inner holes or gaps ) , they make different predictions for stellar accretion rates and disk masses , as well as the radial distribution of the gaseous disk . as a result ,",
    "measuring the radial distribution of disk gas and comparing the stellar accretion rates and disk masses of transition objects with those of accreting t tauri stars of comparable age can potentially sort among the possible explanations for a transitional sed .",
    "for example , a recent study using the latter approach showed that transition objects in taurus ( including v836 tau ) have stellar accretion rates that are on average @xmath133 times lower than those of non - transitional t tauri stars with comparable disk masses ( najita et al .",
    "such a reduced stellar accretion rate is predicted for disks that have formed jovian mass planets ( e.g. , lubow & dangelo 2006 ) , suggesting that giant planet formation may play a role in explaining the origin of at least some transition objects .",
    "studies of the radial distribution of the gaseous disk in the system provide an additional way to distinguish the nature of individual transition objects .",
    "for example , although grain growth can render the inner disk optically thin ( within @xmath132 ) , the gas in the same region of the disk is not expected to be altered significantly ; gas would therefore fill the region within @xmath132 .",
    "if a giant planet has formed with a mass sufficient to open a gap , both the gas and dust would be expected to be cleared dynamically from the vicinity of the orbit of the planet , creating an inner disk ( within @xmath134 ) that is fed by accretion streams from an outer disk ( beyond @xmath132 ; lubow , seibert , & artymowicz 1999 ; bryden et al .",
    "1999 ; kley 1999 ; dangelo et al .  2003 ; lubow & dangelo 2006 ) .",
    "accretion streams are not expected in the case of a massive giant planet ( @xmath135 ; e.g. , lubow et al .  1999 ) , and no significant gas or dust is expected anywhere within @xmath132 in this case .",
    "a lack of gas or dust within @xmath132 is also expected in the photoevaporation case ; such systems are further expected to have a very low disk mass ( @xmath136 ; e.g. , alexander & armitage 2007 ) .",
    "our results for v836 tau are intriguing in this context .",
    "compared to the seds of well - studied transition objects such as gm aur and dm tau , where a strong infrared excess appears only beyond @xmath137 indicating an optically thin region 320au in size ( calvet et al .",
    "2005 ) , the sed of v836 tau shows a significant infrared excess at a shorter wavelength @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , if the v836 tau system has an optically thin inner region , it is comparatively small and plausibly within the range of disk radii probed by co fundamental emission ( within @xmath139au ; najita et al .",
    "the sed of v836 tau can be fit with a simple model of a flared optically thick disk with an inner hole @xmath140au in radius ( see appendix ) . in comparison , the sed of the transition object lkca15 can be interpreted as indicating an optically thin region within @xmath141au ( bergin et al .",
    "2004 ) , or a radial gap extending from 546au ( espaillat et al .",
    "a planet orbiting at such large distances ( @xmath141au or @xmath142au ) may create a gap in the disk , but not radially truncate the gaseous disk significantly within 1au .",
    "in contrast , systems like v836 tau , in which the sed may indicate an optically thin region at much smaller radii ( @xmath143au ) , are the ones for which the co fundamental emission would in principle be capable of diagnosing a physically truncated inner disk if an orbiting companion is present . the radially truncated co emission that we observe may support this picture .    as an alternative interpretation of the available data , the short wavelength sed of v836 tau ( @xmath144 )",
    "can also be fit with a simple model of an inclined ( @xmath145 ) , geometrically flat disk ( see appendix ) that possibly results from significant grain growth and settling .",
    "in such a situation , the gaseous disk would be radially continuous and we might expect to observe a co profile like those of other non - transition t tauri stars .",
    "such a profile , typically centrally peaked , is not observed .    in the photoevaporation and massive giant planet scenarios for the origin of a transitional sed",
    ", little gas is expected to be present within @xmath132 , in contrast to the observed situation where a gaseous disk is present at 0.050.4au and ongoing ( possibly intermittent ) stellar accretion is observed .",
    "the relatively high disk mass of v836 tau ( @xmath4 ; andrews & williams 2005 ) , compared to the much smaller masses at which photoevaporation is expected to be able to create an inner hole ( @xmath146 ) , further argues against the photoevaporation scenario .",
    "the possibility of a massive planet is also restricted by current limits on the stellar radial velocity of v836 tau , which constrain the mass of a companion within @xmath147au to @xmath148 ( l. prato , personal communication ) .",
    "these arguments are schematic in that they rely on theoretical predictions that have not been verified observationally . for example",
    ", the sizes of gaps that will be induced by an orbiting companion of a given mass , and the extent to which stellar accretion will be reduced , are poorly known from an observational point of view .",
    "stellar companions have been found to establish large inner holes and to terminate stellar accretion in some transition objects ( coku tau/4ireland & kraus 2008 ; dalessio et al .  2005 ) and not in others ( cs cha  guenther et al .  2007 ;",
    "espaillat et al.2007 ) .",
    "the situation for lower mass companions is essentially unexplored .",
    "as theoretical predictions are tested , it will be useful to examine in detail the range of companion masses that are consistent with the properties of v836 tau .",
    "v836 tau has been classified as a transition object ( strom et al .",
    "1989 ) , a system that may be on the verge of dissipating its disk , possibly as a consequence of planetesimal formation or giant planet formation .",
    "these processes can reduce the continuum opacity in certain regions of the disk , producing an optically thin inner hole or a low column density gap .",
    "if v836 tau has such an optically thin region , the weak near - infrared excess and the stronger @xmath149 excess in the system indicates that the optically thin region is much smaller ( @xmath143au ) than the optically thin region in well - studied transition objects such as gm aur and dm tau ( calvet et al .",
    "2005 ) , where the optically thin region is 320au in radius .",
    "thus co fundamental emission , which probes the region @xmath139au ( najita et al .",
    "2003 ) , can potentially map out the radial structure of the inner gaseous disk in v836 tau to determine , for example , if the inner disk has been truncated by a companion orbiting within 1au .    along these lines , we find that the @xmath16=10 co fundamental line profiles of v836 tau are unusual compared to those of other t tauri stars in being markedly double - peaked .",
    "the strength and shape of the line emission is consistent with emission from a keplerian disk over a limited range of radii ( @xmath150au ) .",
    "further work is needed to determine whether the outer radius of the emission results from the physical truncation of the disk beyond @xmath100au or the truncated excitation of the @xmath16=10 co fundamental transitions beyond this radius .",
    "a theoretical approach to this problem requires studies of the thermal , chemical , and excitation structure of disks at a level of detail that is appropriate for comparison with observations .",
    "studies of the possibility of non - lte co level populations in low accretion rate systems would be particularly welcome . for a more empirical approach to the problem",
    ", we might compare the observed line profiles of v836 tau with other low accretion rate systems in which the disk is expected to be radially continuous within a few au .",
    "as an example of the latter approach , we discussed the co fundamental line profiles of lkca15 , a t tauri star with a low accretion rate similar to that of v836 tau .",
    "the more centrally peaked line profiles of lkca15 , if representative of other low accretion rate systems , would suggest that the double - peaked emission profiles of v836 tau arise from a physically truncated inner disk .",
    "such a physically truncated inner disk might arise if the system has formed a jovian mass planet that has cleared a gap in the disk .",
    "a simple fit to the sed of v836 tau is consistent with a flared disk that has an optically thin region within @xmath140au .",
    "thus , a possible interpretation of the data is that an orbiting companion has created a gap between a gaseous inner disk within 0.4au and an optically thick outer disk beyond 1au .",
    "since the above fit to the sed is non - unique , it would be useful to use both improved sed modeling techniques ( e.g. , calvet et al .",
    "2005 ) and infrared interferometry ( e.g. , ratzka et al .  2007 ) to test the hypothesis that the dust disk has an optically thin gap or inner hole .    in systems that have formed a jovian mass planet , small grains may be filtered out of the inward accretion flow at the outer edge of the gap ( rice et al .",
    "2006 ) , rendering the dust distribution a poor tracer of the physical structure of the disk at smaller radii .",
    "gaseous disk tracers , like the co fundamental emission discussed here , may then be _ needed _ to probe disk structure at these smaller radii .",
    "thus , there is considerable motivation to expand the study of gaseous disk diagnostics beyond the present case , to understand more generally whether and how well diagnostics such as co fundamental emission can probe the radial structure of gaseous disks .",

    "[ 2007b ] or gullbring et al .",
    "[ 1998 ] ) suggests that the disk temperature distribution will be dominated by the passive reprocessing of stellar radiation .",
    "accordingly , simple seds fits suggest that the short wavelength sed can be fit either as a passive optically thick disk that is flat at small radii and radially continuous ( fig .",
    "8) or as a passive , flared optically thick disk with an inner hole ( fig .",
    "9 ) .    in the former case ,",

    "the disk is assumed to be optically thick beyond the dust sublimation radius ( where @xmath153k ) and to have negligible optical depth within that radius ( @xmath154au ) . while the @xmath155 excess is well fit and arises from disk radii within 0.5au , the excesses at 24 and 70@xmath7 are underpredicted .",
    "a disk that is more strongly flared beyond @xmath156au would likely produce a better fit .",
    "while such a simple model does a reasonable job fitting the short wavelength sed , it implies that the inner radius of the dust disk ( at 0.017au ) is within the inner radius of the co emission ( at @xmath129au ;  3.3 ) .",

    "the cgplus model is based on the models of chiang & goldreich ( 1997 ) and dullemond , dominik , & natta ( 2001 ) .",
    "the model includes four physical components : a stellar blackbody , a puffed - up inner rim , the disk surface , and the disk interior .",
    "figure 9 shows the contribution to the sed of a disk truncated at an inner rim temperature of 330k , corresponding to a disk radius of 1.1au . the inner rim ( long dashed line )",
    "is modestly flared ( @xmath158 ) , and the rest of the disk is less strongly flared ( @xmath159 ) . while the stellar blackbody was used in calculating the temperature of the other components , in constructing the composite sed we used a basel stellar atmosphere v2.2 ( corrected ; lejeune 2002 ) of the same effective temperature .",
