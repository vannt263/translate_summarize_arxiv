    "to those who believe that the late - time acceleration of the universe can be explained by modified theories of gravity to mimic dark energy , the @xmath2 gravity theories have always been of great significance during the last decade .",
    "indeed such issues were first discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite ( also for a more recent study see ref .",
    "because of their direct generalizations of the ricci scalar function in the geometric part of the gravitational action , @xmath2 theories appear to be the most intuitive modifications to general relativity ( for remarkable reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . during the last decade ,",
    "the @xmath2 theories have been subjected to serious theoretical investigations in order to check their consistency with observational evidences .",
    "for example in refs .",
    "@xcite , some models have been compared to the local gravitational tests within the solar system .",
    "moreover , the contribution of @xmath2 gravity in cosmological studies has been advanced by its developers .",
    "for example , imposition of observational constraints on several @xmath2 models in the palatini formalism @xcite , the relevance of cosmographic parameters to the constraining of higher order @xmath2 cosmology @xcite , impacts of noether s symmetry on exact cosmological solutions @xcite and also the emergence of dark energy effects from @xmath2 theories at large scales @xcite have been discussed .",
    "furthermore , a variety of @xmath2 extensions to other alternative gravitational theories like hoava gravity , have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors provide a good platform to unify descriptions of the early - time inflation and late - time universal acceleration .",
    "a very peculiar case of the theories has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where this model was calibrated in such a way that the parameter space close to the @xmath3cdm model could be consistent with the observational data . in ref .",
    "@xcite , two classes of @xmath2 theories are set into the cosmic observational results ( including the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae ) , and compare the modified gravity predictions to those of dark energy models .",
    "it has also been shown that through a negative equation of state , scalar degrees of freedom in power - law and starobinsky @xmath2 models , are of considerable importance in producing late - time acceleration ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the above examples are just a sample of the tremendous amount of works which have been devoted to developing @xmath2 cosmology .",
    "however , everything becomes more interesting when the solar system gravitational tests , prompt the necessity of spherically symmetric spacetime geometries extracted from @xmath2 theories . as it is well - known",
    ", such approach is essentially so old and dates back to the famous schwarzschild spherically symmetric static solution of einstein field equations .",
    "however , it inevitably becomes the most reliable approach to the solar system mass contents as those spherically symmetric objects , responsible for gravitational effects .",
    "this approach , as well as in the case of the schwarzschild solution of the general theory of relativity , constitutes the foundations of the mathematical descriptions of @xmath2 black holes .",
    "an enthusiastic tripper actually is exposed to a rather extensive field of study once he / she turns to fundamental facets of such astrophysical objects .",
    "however it makes sense to begin with available spherically symmetric solutions to @xmath2 field equations to construct a valid framework .",
    "so far , such solutions have been obtained and discussed within several classes of @xmath2 theories ( for example see refs .",
    "@xcite for spherically symmetric solutions and refs .",
    "@xcite for some other features , including axial symmetry ) .",
    "static solutions of different @xmath2 models , regarded as generators of the exterior geometries of static @xmath2 black holes , have also been studied in terms of their general features in the context of schwarzschild-(anti ) de sitter black holes @xcite and charged spherically symmetric black holes introducing a maxwell source @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a good review ) .",
    "these studies have been generalized to classes of solutions of spherically symmetric spacetimes for non - linearly charged sources in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the near horizon effects regarding the satisfaction / violation of the strong energy condition ( sec ) have been discussed .",
    "extra dimensional charged @xmath2 black holes have also been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , facing the concept of black holes , one s mind retrieves the final fate of a super - massive star once it has consumed its nuclear fuel and embarks on shrinking until it reaches a certain gravitational radius .",
    "this is what that was firstly highlighted in 1939 by oppenheimer and snyder in their outstanding paper `` _ on continued gravitational contraction _ ''",
    "there , they treated an observer , comoving with a star s surface with interior and exterior geometries given respectively by the friedmann - lamatre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) and schwarzschild metrics .",
    "once the interior and exterior regions were linked , the observer would detect a fatal contraction of the star s surface .",
    "this process is known as the oppenheimer - snyder ( os ) collapse which provides a collapsing geometrical framework known as the os spacetime .",
    "the large popularity of studying the os collapse of spherical stars , as well as in general relativity , has also taken place in the context of alternative theories like @xmath2 gravity .",
    "the general cases of perfect fluid stars have been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite where it has been suggested that the scalar curvature itself can function as the source of a repulsive force which erodes the collapsing process .",
    "such perfect fluid stars have proven to possess an apparent horizon if some certain initial conditions are satisfied @xcite .",
    "additionally , the os collapse in some specific examples of @xmath2 theories was given rigorous attentions in refs .",
    "moreover , the spherical os collapse effects on the scalar degree of freedom @xmath4 , have been proved to claim the transition from general relativity to @xmath2 gravity during the reinforcement of the gravitational energy @xcite .    in this paper",
    "as well , we study the os collapse of a spherical perfect fluid star within a specific class of @xmath2 theories .",
    "initially , this theory was introduced in the form of @xmath5 @xcite with particular attention to the special case of @xmath6 ( like in the current study ) in ref .",
    "the model was intended to describe the late - time acceleration , but soon it was revealed that this theory suffers from a variety of problems such as matter instability @xcite , lack of a matter domination era @xcite and inconsistency with the solar system constraints @xcite .",
    "these problems mostly originate in the fact that the model suggests that @xmath7 .",
    "so to overcome this dilemma , one way is to adjust the theory to @xmath8 . in this way",
    ", the consequent condition @xmath9 can significantly heal the shortages of the original model ; the stability is retrieved @xcite and a consistent matter domination era is retained @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the conformity with the standard local gravity tests in the solar system has been elaborated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a static spherically symmetric solution for the weak field version of @xmath0 gravity has been used . generally and in the geometric units ( @xmath10 ) , the relevant field equations are obtained by imposing @xmath11 in the modified action @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the matter lagrangian which is described in terms of the spacetime metric @xmath14 and matter fields @xmath15 .",
    "the standard variation with respect to the metric gives the field equations @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the energy - momentum tensor . in ref .",
    "@xcite a spherically symmetric solution to the vacuum field equations of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fieldeqn ] ) was proposed in the form @xmath19 with    [ eq : solutionspecified ] @xmath20    in which @xmath21 , @xmath22 = \\mathrm{m}$ ] and @xmath23 = \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the above solution , determines the exterior geometry of a spherically symmetric massive object of mass @xmath24 , and the impacts of the @xmath0 theory is only supposed to generate a perturbation on the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "therefore this solution is pretty useful in inspecting the behavior of the theory in the solar system .",
    "however in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that some certain ranges of @xmath1 within the @xmath0 theories correspond to the existence of trapped surfaces on the schwarzschild radius @xmath25 .",
    "such surfaces signal the existence of trapping horizons which are traits of black hole regions caused by the gravitational collapse .",
    "these regions are hence , providers of cosmic censorship @xcite .    in this paper therefore , we study such collapse of the outer shell of a spherical star , beyond which the geometry is described by the line element in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : solutiongeneral ] ) and ( [ eq : solutionspecified ] ) .",
    "our aim is the determination of specific ranges for the parameter @xmath1 which can provide an attractive gravitational force in order to be consistent with the spherical os collapse for relevant massive objects .",
    "such relevance is proved to be relying on the mass relation of a star , to its density and radius .",
    "we show that such relation in the @xmath0 theories is not simply given by the multiplication of density by volume .",
    "the mass contents of a typical star then make it possible for adoption of reliable values of @xmath1 .",
    "regarding the outer shell of a star as a time - like congruence , we independently investigate the possibility of the collapse of the outer shell , through evaluating the attraction / repulsion conditions and the sec .",
    "this will be done by applying that time - like congruence in a geodesic raychaudhuri equation .",
    "the results confirm that once both the junction conditions are satisfied , the collapse criteria are different from those in general relativity ( collapsing within repulsive gravity ) , but approximately the same as those for ultra massive objects .",
    "however the crucial role of @xmath1 can be discriminated for heavier objects like neutron stars . in the @xmath0 theory",
    ", such objects appear to be more unstable than they are in general relativity .",
    "however , violating the first junction condition , the time - like shell is no more geodesic and normalized and we will take care of the situation by means of a generalized version of the raychaudhuri equation for non - normalized tangential vectors . in this way , we argue that stars who lose the connection between interior and exterior regions , exhibit anomalous properties in the @xmath0 theory of gravity ; attractive gravity for stars of masses below the chandrasekhar limit . for higher masses , once again",
    ", diverse values of @xmath1 tell significantly different stories about the collapsing criteria ( collapse within repulsive gravity and holding up within attractive gravity ) . based on their predictions",
    ", we can therefore classify the @xmath0 theory of gravity in term of values of @xmath1 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : massos ] we bring the essentials of the os collapse of a time - like shell of a spherical star and calculate the mass relation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : convergencelinked ] , we work out the sec for a time - like star s surface moving on a geodesic and based on different values of @xmath1 , we demonstrate the possibility of a congruence convergence and therefore an os collapse . the same analysis is taken care of in sec .",
    "[ sec : convergencenon - normalized ] for a star which has lost the connection between its interior and exterior geometries .",
    "we introduce the generalized raychaudhuri equation and apply it to determine the extent of disconnection for a specific example .",
    "this example is specialized for typical stars of definite masses and collapse conditions are discussed .",
    "concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] . throughout this paper ,",
    "the greek indices @xmath26 are 4-dimensional whereas the latin ones , i.e. @xmath27 are 3-dimensional .",
    "furthermore , the positive parts of the square roots are considered .",
    "let us assume that the star s surface is described by a 3-dimensional time - like hypersurface @xmath28 , which separates its interior region @xmath29 from its exterior region @xmath30 .",
    "considering @xmath31 and @xmath32 to be respectively the metrics of the interior and exterior spacetime manifolds , then the induced metric ( or the first fundamental form ) , intrinsic to the outer and inner sides of @xmath28 ( i.e. @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) can be obtained by restricting the line element to displacements on either sides of @xmath28 .",
    "this can be done by introducing the intrinsic coordinates @xmath35 on both sides of @xmath28 , which satisfy the parametric equation @xmath36 .",
    "this way , we can define three tangential 4-vectors @xcite @xmath37 on @xmath38 . for any 4-vectors @xmath39 normal to @xmath38",

    "this is called the first junction condition and is denoted by @xmath45\\equiv\\gamma_{ab}(\\mathcal{v}^+)|_\\sigma - \\gamma_{ab}(\\mathcal{v}^-)|_\\sigma = \\gamma_{ab}^+|_{\\sigma_+}-\\gamma_{ab}^-|_{\\sigma_- } = \\mathbf{0}.\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq:1stjunction - general ] ) provides six independent equations .",
    "in general relativity , the first junction condition is applied in order to be assured that @xmath46 and @xmath14 together form a valid solution to einstein field equations @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that these two metrics are not in need of any coordinate transformations in order to satisfy the smooth joining over @xmath28 @xcite . moreover ,",
    "if the enveloping spacetimes contain only positive energies , the first junction condition is automatically satisfied @xcite .",
    "however this can not be guaranteed in alternative theories like @xmath2 gravity , because the discussions in ref .",
    "@xcite have been largely based on the null energy condition in the context of general relativity . in this paper",
    ", we also consider the case of violating the first junction condition and argue that if the interior and exterior regions lose their smooth connection , at some points the exterior segment of the hypersurface , i.e. @xmath34 , can simply overlook the interior segment and therefore it causes a prompted gravitational collapse in attractive gravity , even in smaller stars .",
    "+ to obviate the mentioned smooth transition across @xmath28 , it is also demanded that the extrinsic curvature be the same on both @xmath38 .",
    "the extrinsic curvature ( or the second fundamental form ) of a hypersurface is a symmetric tensorial object which is a useful tool to expresses the embedding of a hypersurface into its enveloping space .",
    "if the hypersurface is the one that does a temporal foliation of a time - like congruence , then the extrinsic curvature can be used to accentuate the hypersurface concavity / convexity and the corresponding convergence / divergence of the congruence .",

    "we first pursued the standard procedure in which , the smooth joining across the star s surface holds by relying on the first and second junction conditions . in the same way as in the original approach to the os collapse , we constructed a framework to find a relation between the mass content of a collapsing star and its density .",
    "the results argue that this relation does not coincide with that in general relativity , as it possesses extra terms and consequently , extra forms of mass / energy distribution .",

    "was supposed to be the spherically symmetric solution to the weak field limit of the theory , which shows small perturbations on the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "such perturbations are hence responsible for deviations from general relativity s predicted mass distribution .",
    "however , the importance of these perturbations becomes more apparent once we turn to the evolution of the time - like boundary of the star . maintaining the smooth joining across this boundary",
    ", we found that the parameter @xmath1 of the theory , performs a crucial role in anticipating the surface s evolution .",
    "the relevant analysis was highly based on studying the sec on different types of stars and restricting @xmath1 into some specific ranges .",
    "we showed that , putting aside the concrete predictions of the theory for a star like the sun , various ranges of @xmath1 will result in theories which give totally apposite collapsing conditions for heavier stars . accordingly , we could create two different categories of the theory , each of which corresponds to satisfaction / violation of the sec .",
    "this therefore emphasizes the importance of the adoption of the approach ( i.e. a specified range in the theory ) in investigating the possibility of the gravitational collapse , even when the smooth joining does hold .",
    "the situation becomes more convoluted when the star loses the connection with its exterior geometry . as a first result",
    ", the union of interior and exterior geometries do not constitute an exact solution to the gravitational field equations .",
    "this manifests itself in violation of the first junction condition . in the context of @xmath0 theory",

    ", we exemplified a specific kind of violation .",

    "the illustrations showed that if the smooth joining is lost at some levels , even smaller stars may experience an attractive gravitational field , but a shell repulsion .",
    "this unexpected phenomenon appears to be available in the whole ranges of @xmath1 .",
    "however for heavier stars , we still encountered two categories , giving a division within the theory which separated two completely opposite predictions . in the quest for finding reliable alternative gravitational theories ,",
