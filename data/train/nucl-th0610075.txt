    "anisotropic flow can reflect the initial state of the heavy ion reaction and evolution dynamics .",
    "in addition , the information of the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) could be also learned from the flow studies @xcite .",
    "many studies of the 1-th and 2-nd anisotropic flows , namely the directed flow and elliptic flow revealed much rich physics in heavy ion collision ( hic ) dynamics .",
    "recently , it was demonstrated that the number of constituent - quark ( ncq ) scaling exhibits from the measurement of transverse momentum dependence of the elliptic flow for different mesons and baryons in ultra - relativistic au + au collision experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) in brookhaven national laboratory @xcite , it indicates that the partonic degree of the freedom plays a dominant role in the formation of the dense matter during early stage of collisions .",
    "the coalescence or recombination models of the constituent quarks have been proposed to interpret the ncq - scaling of hadrons at rhic @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the coalescence mechanism has been also used to explain the formation of light fragments and their spectra of kinetic energy or momentum in intermediate energy heavy ion collisions some times ago @xcite .",
    "in addition , mass dependence of the directed flow was experimentally investigated in a few studies @xcite . however ,",
    "systematic theoretical studies on the anisotropic flow of different nuclear fragments in intermediate energy domain in terms of the coalescence mechanism is still rare .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the flow scaling of light nuclear fragments in a framework of a nucleonic transport model , namely isospin - dependent quantum molecular dynamics ( idqmd ) at intermediate energies . a naive coalescence mechanism in nucleonic level",
    "was applied to analyze the fragment flows .",
    "dependences of the number - of - nucleon ( nn ) of the anisotropic flows , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are surveyed , and the ratio of @xmath2 to @xmath4 is studied .",
    "anisotropic flow is defined as the different @xmath5-th harmonic coefficient @xmath6 of an azimuthal fourier expansion of the particle invariant distribution @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the azimuthal angle between the transverse momentum of the particle and the reaction plane .",
    "note that in the coordinate system the @xmath9-axis along the beam axis , and the impact parameter axis is labelled as @xmath10-axis .    the first harmonic coefficient @xmath0 represents the directed flow , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is transverse momentum .",
    "@xmath1 represents the elliptic flow which characterizes the eccentricity of the particle distribution in momentum space , @xmath13 and @xmath2 represents the 4-th momentum anisotropy , @xmath14    in this work , we will study the above flow components .",
    "the quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) approach is an n - body theory to describe heavy ion reactions from intermediate energy to 2 a gev .",
    "it includes several important parts : the initialization of the target and the projectile nucleons , the propagation of nucleons in the effective potential , the collisions between the nucleons , the pauli blocking effect and the numerical tests .",
    "a general review about qmd model can be found in @xcite .",
    "the idqmd model is based on qmd model affiliating the isospin factors , which includes the mean field , two - body nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collisions and pauli blocking @xcite .    in the qmd model",
    "each nucleon is represented by a gaussian wave packet with a width @xmath15 ( here @xmath16 = 2.16 @xmath17 ) centered around the mean position @xmath18 and the mean momentum @xmath19 , @xmath20 exp[-\\frac{i\\vec{r } \\cdot \\vec{p_i}(t)}{\\hbar}].\\ ] ]    the nucleons interact via nuclear mean field and nucleon - nucleon collision . the nuclear mean field",
    "can be parameterized by @xmath21 with @xmath22 the normal nuclear matter density ( 0.16 @xmath23 is used here ) .",
    "@xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the total , neutron and proton densities , respectively .",
    "@xmath27 is @xmath9th component of the isospin degree of freedom , which equals 1 or -1 for neutrons or protons , respectively .",
    "the coefficients @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are parameters for nuclear equation of state .",
    "two set parameters are used : @xmath28 = -124 mev , @xmath29 = 70.5 mev and @xmath30 = 2.0 which corresponds to the so - called hard eos , with an incompressibility of @xmath31 = 380 mev ; and @xmath28 = -356 mev , @xmath29 = 303 mev and @xmath30 = 7/6 which corresponds to the so - called soft eos with an incompressibility of @xmath31 = 200 mev ; @xmath32 is the symmetry energy strength due to the difference of neutron and proton @xcite , here @xmath33 mev is used to consider isospin effects , or @xmath34 for no isospin effect .",
    "@xmath35 is the coulomb potential , @xmath36 is yukawa ( surface ) potential . in this model ,",
    "the isospin effects can be included in some terms , such as in - medium nucleon - nucleon cross section and pauli blocking @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the colliding system is given by the generalized variational principal .",
    "since the qmd can naturally describe the fluctuation and correlation , we can study the nuclear clusters in the model @xcite . in qmd model , nuclear clusters are usually recognized by a simple coalescence model : i.e. nucleons are considered to be part of a cluster if in the end at least one other nucleon is closer than @xmath37 fm in coordinate space and @xmath38 mev / c in momentum space @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has been extensively applied in transport theory for the cluster formation .",
    "reactions of @xmath39ca + @xmath39ca , @xmath40kr + @xmath41ni and @xmath40kr + @xmath42sn at 25 mev / nucleon have been simulated by idqmd . to compare the results from different reactions ,",
    "the similar centrality has been chosen for the above systems , namely 4 - 8 fm , 6 - 10 fm and 7 - 11 fm , respectively .",
    "since the reaction systems tend to freeze - out around 120 fm / c in the model calculation , the physics results can be extracted in the freeze - out stage . in this work ,",
    "the results are extracted at 200 fm / c .",
    "some parts of physics results have been reported in our recent papers  @xcite .",
    "the directed flow @xmath0 as a function of rapidity ( @xmath43 ) for the above systems has been studied .",
    "[ fig - v1-y ] shows @xmath0 versus rapidity ( upper panels ) and the nucleon - number scaled @xmath0/a as a function of rapidity . from this figure",
    ", we found that the slope of the directed flow as a function of rapidity is negative for three systems at 25 mev / nucleon , which indicates that attractive mean filed is important in such a low energy @xcite . before the nucleon - number scaling ,",
    "the values of directed flow are different for different - mass clusters : the heavier the clusters , the large the absolute value of directed flow .",
    "however , all the curves of rapidity - dependent @xmath0 almost collapse onto the same curves by dividing @xmath0 by its number of nucleon , which illustrates that the directed flow of the light nuclear clusters satisfies the number - of - nucleon scaling .",

    ", it shows that elliptic flows are positive and increase with the increasing of @xmath46 even though the values are a little different for the different cases .",
    "the positive value of @xmath1 reflects that the light clusters are preferentially emitted within the reaction plane , and particles with higher transverse momentum tend to be strongly emitted within in - plane , i.e. stronger positive elliptic flow . in comparison to the elliptic flow at rhic energies ,",
    "the apparent behavior of elliptic flow versus @xmath46 looks similar , but the mechanism is obviously different . in intermediate energy domain ,",
    "collective rotation is one of the main mechanisms to induce the positive elliptic flow @xcite . in this case , the elliptic flow is mainly driven by the attractive mean field .",
    "however , the strong pressure which is built in early initial geometrical almond - type anisotropy due to the overlap zone between both colliding nuclei in coordinate space will rapidly transforms into the azimuthal anisotropy in momentum space at rhic energies @xcite .",
    "in other words , the elliptic flow is mainly driven by the stronger outward pressure .",

    "three simulations were done : hard eos without isospin related terms ( hard@xmath45niso ) , soft eos with isospin related terms ( soft@xmath45iso ) , and soft eos without isospin related terms ( soft@xmath45niso ) .",

    "recent the rhic results show that @xmath3 for hadrons keeps an almost constant which is independent on @xmath46 @xcite , we would like to know what the higher order momentum anisotropy in the intermediate energy is . in the present work , we explore the behavior of @xmath2 in the model calculation .",
    "[ fig - v4 ] shows the features of @xmath2 for @xmath40kr + @xmath42sn at 25 mev / nucleon for idqmd simulation with hard@xmath45niso , soft@xmath45iso and soft@xmath45niso .",
    "similar to the relationship of @xmath54 versus @xmath51 , we plot @xmath55 as a function of @xmath51 ( the upper panel ) .",
    "the divergence of the different curves between different particles in @xmath55 versus @xmath51 indicates no simple scaling of nucleon number for 4-th momentum anisotropy .",
    "however , if we plot @xmath52 versus @xmath53 ( the middle panels ) , it looks that the points of different particles nearly merge together and it means a certain of scaling holds between two variables . due to a nearly constant value of @xmath3 in the studied @xmath46 range ( see the bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ fig - v4 ] ) together with the number - of - nucleon scaling behavior of @xmath54 vs @xmath51 , @xmath52 should scale with @xmath53 , as shown in the middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig - v4 ] .",
    "interestingly , the constant value of @xmath3 does not depend on the eos and isospin dependent term , which may indicate this constant value is robust for intermediate energy heavy ion collision .",
    "the rhic experimental data demonstrated a scaling relationship between 2-nd flow ( @xmath1 ) and n - th flow ( @xmath6 ) , namely @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that such scaling relation follows from a naive quark coalescence model @xcite that only allows quarks with equal momentum to form a hadron . denoting the meson anisotropic flows by @xmath57 and",
    "baryon anisotropic flows by @xmath58 , it was found that @xmath59 for mesons and @xmath60 for baryons if quarks have no higher - order anisotropic flows .",
    "since mesons dominate the yield of charged particles in rhic data , the smaller scaling factor of @xmath61 than the empirical value of about @xmath62 indicates that higher - order quark anisotropic flows can not be neglected . including the latter contribution",
    ", one can show that @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the quark anisotropic flows . the meson anisotropic flows thus satisfy the scaling relations",
    "if the quark anisotropic flows also satisfy such relations .",
    "one can go one step further and assume that the observed scaling of the hadronic @xmath1 actually results from a similar scaling occurring at the partonic level . in this case , if one assumes @xcite that the scaling relation for the partons is as follows : @xmath65 and",
    "then hadronic ratio @xmath3 then equals @xmath66 for mesons and @xmath67 for baryons , respectively .",
    "if we assume the scaling laws of mesons ( ncq=2 ) and baryons ( ncq=3 ) ( eq .",
    "[ eqn - v4 ] ) are also valid for a = 2 and 3 nuclear clusters , respectively , then @xmath3 for a = 2 and 3 clusters indeed give the same value of 1/2 as nucleons , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig - v4](c ) .",
    "coincidentally the predicted value of the ratio of @xmath3 for hadrons is also 1/2 if the matter produced in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions reaches to thermal equilibrium and its subsequent evolution follows the laws of ideal fluid dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note the same ratio was predicted in two different models at very different energies , which is of course worth to be further investigated in near future .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the behavior of anisotropic flows , namely @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , for light nuclear fragments produced by @xmath39ca + @xmath39ca , @xmath40kr + @xmath41ni and @xmath40kr + @xmath42sn at 25 mev / nucleon for peripheral collisions in the framework of quantum molecular dynamics model .",
    "@xmath0 shows a negative slope versus rapidity , indicating the attractive mean field plays a dominant role in directed flow .",
    "both @xmath1 and @xmath2 generally show positive values and increase with @xmath46 .",
    "the positive @xmath1 illustrates that the in - plane emission is preferential . by the scaling of the number - of - nucleons , both @xmath68 versus rapidity and @xmath54 versus @xmath51 for light nuclear fragments",
    "approximately collapse on the similar curve , respectively , which means that there exists directed flow and elliptic flow scalings on the number - of - nucleon .",
