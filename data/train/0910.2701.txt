    "data reduction was carried out in near identical fashion for both epochs using the miriad package @xcite , taking into consideration the slightly different correlator mode used in the 1993 data .",
    "this process involved editing , calibrating , and imaging the data using multi - frequency synthesis and square pixels of size 50  @xmath33  50 milli - arcseconds .",
    "these images were then deconvolved using a maximum entropy algorithm and smoothed to a common resolution with a circular gaussian of full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) 081 .",
    "the resulting images are shown in the left column of figure [ fig : allimages ] .",

    "the pwn seems to be moving from west to east over time , in agreement with expectation from the cometary morphology seen in figure [ fig : yusef20 cm ] . beyond any minor morphological changes seen between the images in the left column of figure [ fig : allimages ] , the mouse nebula seems to have expanded slightly over time .",
    "to quantify any motion between epochs , an algorithm was developed to evaluate the cross - correlation coefficient over a range of pixel shifts between images , essentially by producing a map of these coefficients .",
    "this algorithm made use of the karma visualization package @xcite to impose accurate non - integer pixel shifts .",
    "we applied our algorithm to the image pair from the left column of figure [ fig : allimages ] to determine an image offset measurement . to check that this offset measurement would be robust against any possible nebular morphological change between epochs",
    ", we also applied our algorithm to the same image pair when both images were equally clipped at various flux density upper - level cutoffs .",
    "we found that the offset measurement was strongly dependent on the choice of flux density cutoff .",
    "clearly such variation in the measured shift between epochs was not desirable , as selection of a final solution would have required an arbitrary assumption about the appropriate level of flux density clipping to use .",
    "there was also no strong indication that the region of peak flux density in each image coupled with the exact location of psr  j1747@xmath01958 . in order to isolate the motion of the pulsar from as much nebular morphological change as possible , we focused on a different method involving the cross - correlation of spatial derivatives of the images from the left column of figure [ fig : allimages ] .",
    "as there is not enough information to solve for an independent dec - shift , we will only focus on an ra - shift , and will assume that any dec changes are primarily due to morphological evolution of the mouse nebula . to justify this assumption ,",
    "we note simplistically that the cometary tail of the mouse in figure [ fig : yusef20 cm ] is oriented at @xmath165@xmath30  from the ra - axis , and thus estimate that any dec motion contributes less than 10% to the total proper motion of the nebular system .",
    "the small angle also justifies our decision not to calculate derivatives along orthogonal axes rotated against the ra - dec coordinate system .    for each epoch ,",
    "an image of the first spatial derivative of intensity in the x ( ra ) direction was created by shifting the original image by 0.1 pixels along the ra - axis , subtracting the original from this shifted version , and then dividing by the value of the shift .",
    "these x - derivative images are shown in the right column of figure [ fig : allimages ] , where the brighter pixels represent regions of larger x - derivative from the corresponding left column images ( note that these derivative images are shown in absolute value so as to increase their visual contrast ; this operation was not applied to the analyzed data ) .",
    "the x - derivative images have signal - to - noise ratios @xmath813 , since progression to higher derivatives degrades sensitivity .",
    "as seen in the right column of figure [ fig : allimages ] , the x - derivative images of the mouse are divided into two isolated regions : an eastern forward region and a western rear region .",
    "derivatives in the eastern region are greater in magnitude than those in the western region .    as we will justify in ",
    "[ sectiondiscussion ] , we propose that the eastern region of the x - derivative images tracks the forward termination shock of the mouse nebula , which in turn acts as a proxy for an upper limit on the motion of psr  j1747@xmath02958 .",
    "the eastern region provides a natural localized feature at each epoch with which to generate cross - correlation maps in order to track the motion of psr  j1747@xmath02958 .      to prepare the x - derivative images for cross - correlation , their eastern regions ,",
    "extending between right ascensions ( j2000 ) of 17@xmath3547@xmath27158 and 17@xmath3547@xmath27165 ( see figure [ fig : allimages ] ) , were extracted and padded along each side with 50 pixels ( 2500  mas ) of value zero .",
    "these cropped and padded x - derivative images for the 1993 and 2005 epochs were then cross - correlated with each other over a range of non - integer pixel shifts between @xmath02500 and @xmath362500  mas in both ra and dec .",
    "the resultant 2005@xmath01993 cross - correlation map , which indicates the shift required to make the 1993 epoch colocate with the 2005 epoch , is shown in the left of figure [ fig : finalresults ] .",
    "note that the map in figure [ fig : finalresults ] incorporates trial shifts large enough to probe regions where the cross - correlation falls to zero ( corresponding to cross - correlation between signal and a source - free region , as opposed to only probing trial shifts close to the maxima of each x - derivative map ) . in this way",
    ", the contours presented in figure [ fig : finalresults ] represent percentages of the peak cross - correlation value .    to quantify the shift between epochs",
    ", a profile along a line parallel to the ra - axis was taken through the peak of the cross - correlation map , as shown in the right of figure [ fig : finalresults ] .",
    "we assume that morphological changes are negligible in the eastern region of the x - derivative images ; therefore , by taking a profile through the peak we tolerate small dec shifts between the two epochs .",
    "the ra shift between the 2005 and 1993 epochs was determined by fitting a gaussian to the central 660  mas of the cross - correlation profile .",
    "the resultant shift is 154  mas with a statistical uncertainty of 7  mas , where the latter is equal to the fwhm divided by twice the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this calculation reflects the angular resolution and noise in the images , but to completely quantify the error on the shift between the two epochs , systematic errors also need to be incorporated .    to estimate the positional error in the image plane , corresponding to phase error in the spatial frequency plane , the phases of the complex visibility data for each epoch were self - calibrated . by dividing the standard error of the mean of the phase variation in the gain solutions by 180@xmath30 ,",
    "the fraction of a diffraction - limited beam by which positions may have been in error in the image plane were calculated . by multiplying this fraction with the diffraction limited beamwidth for the 1993 and 2005 epochs ,",
    "the two - dimensional relative positional uncertainty of these two reference frames was estimated to be 22 and 20 mas respectively .    the systematic error in our measurement , which describes the relative positional error between the two epochs ,",
    "was then determined by reducing the self - calibrated positional uncertainties for each epoch by @xmath37 ( we are only looking at random positional uncertainties projected along the ra - axis ) , and added in quadrature .",
    "this error was found to be 21  mas , which totally dominates the much smaller statistical error of 7  mas .    by calculating the total error as the quadrature sum of the statistical and systematic errors ,",
    "the ra - shift of the pwn tip between the 1993 and 2005 epochs was found to be @xmath38  mas . when divided by the 4372 days elapsed between these two epochs",
    ", the measured shift corresponds to a proper motion of @xmath39  mas  yr@xmath2 in an eastward direction .",
    "we therefore detect motion at the @xmath40 level . note",
    "that , at an assumed distance of @xmath85  kpc along a line of sight toward the galactic center , this motion is unlikely to be contaminated significantly by galactic rotation @xcite .",
    "if we simplistically compare the eastward component of the proper motion with the angle of the mouse s cometary tail , as described earlier in   [ sectionanalysis ] , we obtain a crude estimate of @xmath81  mas  yr@xmath2 for the northerly component of the nebula s proper motion . as",
    "this value is well within the error for the eastward motion , which is dominated by systematic effects , we feel that our earlier assumption of pure eastward motion in the presence of relative positional uncertainty between the 1993 and 2005 reference frames is justified .",
    "bow shock pwne have a double - shock structure consisting of an outer bow shock where the ambient ism is collisionally excited , an inner termination shock at which the pulsar s relativistic wind is decelerated , and a contact discontinuity between these two shocks which marks the boundary between shocked ism and shocked pulsar wind material @xcite .",
    "the outer bow shock may emit in h@xmath41 , though for systems such as pwn  g359.23@xmath00.82 with high levels of extinction along their line of sight , the detection of such emission would not be expected",
    ". the inner termination shock , which encloses the pulsar s relativistic wind , may emit synchrotron radiation detectable at radio / x - ray wavelengths .",
    "it is expected that any synchrotron emission beyond the termination shock would be sharply bounded by the contact discontinuity @xcite .    as mentioned in ",
    "[ sectionanalysis ] , we suggest that the eastern regions of the x - derivative images from figure [ fig : allimages ] provide the best opportunity to track motion of psr  j1747@xmath02958 , relatively independent of any morphological changes occurring in pwn  g359.23@xmath00.82 . physically , these regions of greatest spatial derivative ( along the ra - axis ) might correspond to the vicinity of the termination shock apex , or possibly the contact discontinuity between the two forward shocks , where motion of the pulsar is causing confinement of its wind and where rapid changes in flux might be expected to occur over relatively small angular scales .",
    "this is consistent with hydrodynamic simulations which predict that the apex of the bow shock will be located just outside a region of intense synchrotron emission in which the pulsar lies @xcite .",
    "the assumption that the eastern region of each x - derivative image can be used as a proxy to track the motion of psr  j1747@xmath02958 is therefore plausible , but difficult to completely justify . to show that motion calculated in this way provides an upper limit to the true motion of psr  j1747@xmath02958 we recall the overall morphological change described at the end of   [ sectionobservations ] , namely that the mouse nebula has expanded with time between the 1993 to 2005 epochs .",
    "this expansion suggests that the ism density may be dropping , causing the termination shock to move further away from pulsar , so that any motion calculated using the nebula may in fact overestimate the motion of the pulsar ( a similar argument was used by @xcite @xcite in placing an upper limit on the motion of the pwn associated with psr  b1757@xmath024 ) .",
    "such changes in density are to be expected as the nebula moves through interstellar space , where like the spectacular guitar nebula @xcite motion may reveal small - scale inhomogeneities in the density of the ism .",
    "we therefore assume that our measurement of proper motion from   [ subsection : finalcalc ] corresponds to an upper limit on the true proper motion of psr  j1747@xmath02958 .      using our proper motion result from   [ subsection : finalcalc ] and the arguments for interpreting this motion as an upper limit from   [ sectiondiscussion ] , the projected eastward velocity of psr  j1747@xmath02958 is inferred to be @xmath42  @xmath43  @xmath44  km  s@xmath2 .",

    "our space velocity for psr  j1747@xmath02958 is comparable with other pulsars that have observed bow shocks @xcite , and is consistent with the overall projected velocity distribution of the young pulsar population @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite estimated a proper motion and space velocity of @xmath725  mas  yr@xmath2 and @xmath7600  km  s@xmath2 , respectively , which are a factor of two larger than the values determined in this paper .",
    "however , by halving their assumed sound speed of 10  km  s@xmath2 , their estimates of motion correspondingly halve .",
    "we now use our proper motion and hydrogen number density results to resolve the question of association between psr  j1747@xmath02958 and snr  g359.1@xmath00.5 , and to investigate the age and possible future evolution of this pulsar .",
    "if psr  j1747@xmath02958 and the adjacent snr  g359.1@xmath00.5 are associated and have a common progenitor , then an age estimate for the system that is independent of both distance and inclination effects is simply the time taken for the pulsar to traverse the eastward angular separation between the explosion site inferred from the snr morphology and its current location , at its inferred eastward proper motion @xmath16  @xmath34 . assuming pulsar birth at the center of the snr , the eastward angular separation between the center of snr  g359.1@xmath00.5 from @xcite and the location of psr  j1747@xmath02958 from the timing solution by @xcite is found to be @xmath53 , which would imply a system age of @xmath54  @xmath15  110  kyr .",
    "given such a large age , and the unremarkable interstellar hydrogen number density at the ( currently assumed ) nearby mouse ( from   [ subsec : spacevel ] ) , it would be difficult to argue why snr  g359.1@xmath00.5 has not dissipated and faded from view .",
    "instead , snr  g359.1@xmath00.5 appears to be a middle aged remnant @xmath818  kyr old which continues to emit thermal x - rays @xcite .",
    "we conclude , independent of distance estimates to either the pulsar or the snr , that psr  j1747@xmath02958 is moving too slowly to be physically associated with the relatively young snr  g359.1@xmath00.5 .",
    "given that an association between the mouse and snr  g359.1@xmath00.5 is unlikely , as outlined in ",
    "[ subsection : association ] , we now estimate the age of psr  j1747@xmath02958 assuming that it is unrelated to this snr .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : yusef20 cm ] , there is a cometary tail of emission extending around 12@xmath55 ( @xmath817@xmath56  pc ) westward of the mouse , containing shocked pulsar wind material flowing back from the termination shock about psr  j1747@xmath02958 @xcite .",
    "we begin by simplistically assuming that this pulsar was born at the tail s western tip . by dividing the tail length by the proper motion @xmath34 , we estimate an age of @xmath57  @xmath7  @xmath58  kyr .",
    "note that this age is independent of any distance estimates to the mouse or of inclination effects .",
    "however , given that the tail appears to simply fade away rather than terminate suddenly , it is possible that tail could be much longer , and thus that the system could be much older ( by considering the upper limit arguments from",
    "  [ sectiondiscussion ] , this system age may be even greater still ) . as discussed in",
    "  4.7 of @xcite , it is unlikely that the mouse or its entire tail could still be located inside an unseen associated snr , given that the tail is smooth and uninterrupted . in addition , the lack of a rejuvenated snr shell anywhere along the length of the tail ( or indeed beyond it ) , such as that seen , for example , in the interaction between psr  b1951@xmath3632 and snr  ctb80 @xcite , supports the conclusion that the mouse s tail is located entirely in the ism .",
    "therefore , the rim of the mouse s unseen associated snr must be located at a minimum angular separation of @xmath812@xmath55 west of the mouse s current location , implying that @xmath57 is a lower limit on the time elapsed since psr  j1747@xmath02958 was in the vicinity of this rim .    to estimate the total age of psr  j1747@xmath02958 we thus need to incorporate the time taken for this pulsar to escape its associated snr and reach its current location , taking into account the continued expansion of the snr following pulsar escape ( which will sweep up , and therefore shorten , part of the mouse s tail initially located in the ism ) .",
    "using monte carlo simulation and following @xcite , we find that the time taken for a pulsar , traveling with velocity @xmath42  @xmath43  @xmath44  km  s@xmath2 through a typical interstellar environment with constant hydrogen number density @xmath48 from ",

    "if we adopt a constant moment of inertia and assume standard electromagnetic dipole braking , then by performing a similar derivation from the spin - down relationship for the surface magnetic field , the magnetic field growth timescale can be expressed as @xmath78=@xmath79 ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) .",

    ", it can be suggested that young , energetic , rapidly spinning pulsars such as psr  j0537@xmath06910 @xcite , whose location in the @xmath82 plane is shown with a star symbol , may evolve into objects like the vela or mouse pulsars , which , as proposed by @xcite , may in turn continue to undergo magnetic field growth until arriving in the parameter space of the magnetars .",
    "we have investigated two epochs of interferometric data from the vla spanning 12 years to indirectly infer a proper motion for the radio pulsar j1747@xmath02958 through observation of its bow shock pwn  g359.23@xmath00.82 .",
    "derivative images were used to highlight regions of rapid spatial variation in flux density within the original images , corresponding to the vicinity of the forward termination shock , thereby acting as a proxy for the motion of the pulsar .",
    "we measure an eastward proper motion for pwn  g359.23@xmath00.82 of @xmath39  mas  yr@xmath2 , and interpret this value as an upper limit on the motion of psr  j1747@xmath02958 . at this angular velocity",
    ", we argue that psr  j1747@xmath02958 is moving too slowly to be physically associated with the relatively young adjacent snr  g359.1@xmath00.5 , independent of distance estimates to either object or of inclination effects .    at a distance @xmath17  kpc ,",
    "the proper motion corresponds to a projected velocity of @xmath42  @xmath43  @xmath44  km  s@xmath2 , which is consistent with the projected velocity distribution for young pulsars . combining the time taken for psr  j1747@xmath02958 to traverse its smooth @xmath812@xmath9 radio tail with the time to escape a typical snr",
    ", we calculate a lower age limit for psr  j1747@xmath02958 of @xmath63  @xmath64  @xmath6  kyr ( 68% confidence )",
    ".    the lower age limit @xmath63 exceeds the characteristic age of psr  j1747@xmath02958 by more than a factor of 6 , arguably providing the most robust evidence to date that some pulsars may be much older than their characteristic age .",
    "this age discrepancy for psr  j1747@xmath02958 suggests that the pulsar s spin rate is slowing with an estimated braking index @xmath71  @xmath16  @xmath76 and that its magnetic field is growing on a timescale @xmath715  kyr .",
    "such potential for magnetic field growth in psr  j1747@xmath02958 , in combination with other neutron stars that transcend their archetypal categories such as psr  j1718@xmath03718 , a radio pulsar with a magnetar - strength magnetic field that does not exhibit magnetar - like emission @xcite , psr  j1846@xmath00258 , a rotation - powered pulsar that exhibits magnetar - like behaviour @xcite , and magnetars such as 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 that exhibit radio emission ( @xcite @xcite , and references therein ) , supports the notion that there may be evolutionary links between the rotation - powered and magnetar classes of neutron stars .",
    "however , such a conclusion may be difficult to reconcile with evidence suggesting that magnetars are derived from more massive progenitors than normal pulsars ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "if the massive progenitor hypothesis is correct , then this raises further questioning of whether , like the magnetars , there is anything special about the progenitor properties of neutron stars such as psr  j1747@xmath02958 , or whether all rotation - powered pulsars exhibit similar magnetic field growth or even magnetar - like phases in their lifetimes .    to constrain the motion of psr  j1747@xmath02958 further , future observational epochs are desirable",
    ". it may be possible to better constrain the motion and distance to this pulsar by interferometric astrometry with the next generation of sensitive radio telescopes ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "high time resolution x - ray observations may also be useful to detect any magnetar - like behaviour from this rotation - powered radio pulsar .",
    "in general , more neutron star discoveries , as well as measured or inferred braking indices , may allow for a better understanding of possible neutron star evolution .",
