    "the past few years have seen a dramatic increase in the precision of cosmological data , ranging from measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite @xcite and the large scale structure ( lss ) of the universe by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , to the observation of distant type ia supernovae ( snia ) @xcite .",
    "all these measurements point to the so - called concordance model of cosmology , wherein the physical parameters are the baryon density @xmath5 , the matter density @xmath6 , the dark energy density @xmath7 , and the present hubble expansion rate @xmath8 .",
    "the model geometry is flat so that @xmath9 , and the initial perturbations are assumed to be adiabatic and gaussian , with a power law spectrum described by a spectral index @xmath10 and an amplitude @xmath11 .",
    "together with the optical depth parameter @xmath12 , this six - parameter `` vanilla '' model provides a good fit to all observational data to date .",
    "a common assumption in cosmological parameter estimation is that one can always improve a fit marginally by including extra free parameters .",
    "this assumption has led to the adoption by many authors of the occam s razor approach , in which an extra parameter is retained only if by its inclusion the goodness - of - fit of the model is substantially improved .",
    "indeed , the success of the vanilla model is rooted in the fact that , given the current data , no addition of a single extra parameter produces a @xmath13 value that is significantly lower",
    ".    however , there are many more physically well motivated parameters beyond the vanilla model .",
    "indeed , some of these , such as a nonzero neutrino mass , are known to be present . in such cases ,",
    "a blind enforcement of occam s rule can lead to significant underestimation of parameter errors , as well as bias in the parameter estimates .",
    "one well - known example is the interplay between the dark energy equation of state and the neutrino mass @xcite .",
    "when the dark energy equation of state is allowed to vary , the neutrino mass bound is relaxed by almost a factor of three if only cmb and lss power spectrum information is used .",
    "conversely , by imposing a prior on the neutrino masses according to the heidelberg ",
    "moscow claims , reference @xcite finds that a cosmological constant is ruled out at more than @xmath14 c.l .  by cmb+lss+snia data .",
    "one could argue that parameter estimation coupled with occam s rule is a `` bottom - up '' approach , for which a full bayesian analysis complete with bayes factor calculations may also be appropriate @xcite .",
    "however , if one s aim is to _ exclude _ specific models , then a more conservative approach that takes into account possible degeneracies between the `` standard '' and the `` new '' parameters is warranted .",
    "such a `` top - down '' approach does not necessarily imply a decrease in the predictability of the model .",
    "in fact , we will show that given the present cosmological data , a nonvanishing neutrino mass could be viewed as a prediction of the @xmath15 inflationary model .",
    "we argue that when constraining or excluding specific theoretical models , one should in principle allow for uncertainties in all physically well - motivated parameters , even if they have _ a priori _ no direct link to the models concerned . if , for instance , it turns out later that the universe is indeed composed of a nonvanishing neutrino fraction , it would be counterproductive to have already discarded a model of inflation that predicts this outcome .    in the present work",
    ", we investigate in this spirit how parameter constraints change when the parameter estimation analysis is performed within a much more general model framework . in principle",
    "there are some twenty or more parameters that could influence cosmology , although the precision of the present data is not yet sufficient to probe some of them ( e.g. , the primordial helium fraction and the effective sound speed of dark energy ) . here",
    ", we focus on a 11-parameter model outlined below .",
    "we test a general 11-parameter model space consisting of @xmath16 the vanilla model is defined by @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . in addition , we marginalise over a nuisance parameter @xmath19 which describes the relative bias between the observed galaxy power spectrum @xmath20 and the underlying dark matter spectrum @xmath21 via @xmath22 .",
    "three different parameter sets will be considered in this work :    * set a : all 11 parameters . *",
    "set b : a 10-parameter set with @xmath23 .",
    "this parameter set covers all standard inflationary models * set c : a 9-parameter set with @xmath24 .",
    "this reduced set corresponds to the large subset of the zoo of inflationary models that predict negligible running , including large field chaotic inflation models @xcite .",
    "we assume the matter content to be specified by the following parameters : the curvature @xmath25 , the physical dark matter density @xmath26 , the baryon density @xmath27 , the neutrino fraction @xmath28 , and the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath29 .",
    "other parameters not included here , but which could have an observable effect , include a time - dependent dark energy equation of state , nonstandard interactions in any of the dark sectors ( cold dark matter , neutrinos , or dark energy ) , etc .",
    "we mention this as a caution that while our parameter space is much larger than that normally used in parameter estimation analyses , it is not necessarily complete .     +   +      the initial conditions for structure formation are assumed to be set by inflation , characterised by scalar and tensor fluctuations with amplitude @xmath11 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "each component is specified by a spectral index @xmath10 or @xmath31 , and the inflationary consistency relation requires that @xmath32 .",
    "however , the precision of current data is not yet at a level where a violation of the consistency relation can be tested .",
    "this also means that while the running parameter @xmath33 should be included for the scalar spectrum , the inclusion of its tensor counterpart @xmath34 would have no effect .",
    "this set of initial parameters encompasses all standard inflationary models , but not models with features from potential steps , particle production , etc.during inflation .",
    "we define @xmath33 at the pivot scale @xmath35 mpc@xmath36 , in concordance with most recent analyses .",
    "note that an alternative approach would be to perform the analysis directly in terms of the slow - roll parameters instead of the observables @xmath10 , @xmath33 , and @xmath2 @xcite . particularly for models where @xmath33 is not negligible",
    "this can lead to somewhat different results .",
    "however , in models with small @xmath33 , such as chaotic inflation , the results are identical .",
    "+    _ cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) _ we use cmb data from the wmap experiment after three years of observation @xcite .",
    "the data analysis is performed using the likelihood calculation package provided by the wmap team on the lambda homepage @xcite .",
    "_ large scale structure ( lss ) _ the large scale structure power spectrum of luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) has been measured by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "we use the same analysis technique on this data set as advocated by the sdss team @xcite , with analytic marginalisation over the bias @xmath19 and the nonlinear correction parameter @xmath37 .    _ baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) _ in addition to the power spectrum data we use the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations in the two - point correlation function @xcite .",
    "the analysis is performed following the procedure described in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , including analytic marginalisation over the bias @xmath19 , and nonlinear corrections with the halofit @xcite package .",
    "_ type ia supernovae ( snia ) _ we use the luminosity distance measurements of distant type ia supernovae provided by the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) @xcite .    _",
    "lyman-@xmath38 forest _ we do not include data from the lyman-@xmath38 forest in our analysis . these data were used in some previous studies that found very strong bounds on various cosmological parameters  @xcite . however , the strength of these bounds is due mainly to the fact that the lyman-@xmath38 analysis used in @xcite leads to a much higher normalisation of the small - scale power spectrum than that obtained from the wmap data .",
    "other analyses of the same sdss lyman-@xmath38 data find a lower normalisation , in better agreement with the wmap result  @xcite .",
    "this kind of discrepancy between different analyses of the same data probably points to unresolved systematic issues , and for this reason we prefer to discard the lyman-@xmath38 data entirely .    for a large part of our analysis we use two different combinations of data sets , one consisting of wmap and sdss data only , and one which uses in addition data from snia ( snls ) and bao .",
    "the latter case is sometimes referred to as `` the full data set '' .",
    "we perform the data analysis using the publicly available cosmomc package @xcite , modified to include the bao likelihood calculations .",
    ".[tab : inflation1 ] the @xmath14 c.l .  allowed ranges for @xmath10 , @xmath2 and @xmath33 for parameter set b , marginalised over the other @xmath39 parameters . [",

    "we have performed a detailed study of cosmological parameter estimation in the context of extended models that encompass a larger model parameter space than the standard , flat @xmath0cdm cosmology . using the 6-parameter vanilla model as a basis ,",
    "we include as additional parameters only those that are physically motivated , such as a nonzero neutrino mass .",
    "we consider a 11-parameter model and subsets thereof , in contrast with the vanilla+1 approach adopted in most previous analyses which treats one extra parameter at a time .    in this more general framework",
    ", we find that in the context of standard slow - roll inflation , constraints on the dark matter and dark energy parameters can be substantially altered .",
    "if only cmb and lss data are used , the larger parameter space introduces new , strong parameter degeneracies , e.g. , between the physical dark matter density @xmath40 and the dark energy equation of state @xmath29 .",
    "these degeneracies can be broken to a large extent by adding type ia supernova and baryon acoustic oscillation data to the analysis . however , even with this expanded data set , we find that the bound on the physical dark matter density @xmath41 relaxes by more than a factor of two compared to the vanilla model constraint .    in the same spirit , we have studied how bounds on the inflationary parameters @xmath10 , @xmath2 , and @xmath33 are affected by the introduction of extra parameters in the analysis .",
    "we find that the simplest @xmath1 model of inflation is still compatible with all present data at the @xmath14 level , in contrast with other recent analyses @xcite .",
    "the source of this apparent discrepancy is a strong degeneracy between the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath2 and the neutrino fraction @xmath42 , the latter of which was fixed at zero in the analyses of @xcite . reversing the argument ,",
    "if @xmath1 is the true model of inflation , then it strongly favours a sum of quasi - degenerate neutrino masses between @xmath43 and @xmath44 ev , a range compatible with present data from laboratory experiments .",
    "this represents a clear example of how neutrino masses well within laboratory limits can bias conclusions about other , seemingly unrelated cosmological parameters .",
