    "analytic descriptions of physical systems are convenient for understanding quickly and easily how a system works under various conditions .",
    "an example is population control in quantum systems , namely transfer of electrons from an ensemble of atoms all in the same initial state to specified final states within the ensemble .",
    "this is used in problems ranging from quantum information @xcite to chemical dynamics @xcite .",
    "such problems are often studied in terms of a single electron in an atom with @xmath0 discrete states interacting with a strong external field @xcite . in this paper",
    "analytic expressions are presented for the transition probabilities as a function of time in a degenerate @xmath0-state atom .",
    "once analytic solutions are obtained , corrections due to finite energy splittings can be introduced , e.g. in numerical calculations .",
    "then real systems with finite differences in the energies of the @xmath0 states can be studied .",
    "our degenerate energy approximation is somewhat similar to the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) @xcite that has been widely applied to both @xmath7 and @xmath8-state atomic models . in rwa , however , degenerate atomic states are not used .",
    "instead one tunes the frequency of the external field @xmath9 to the frequency difference of two non - degenerate states so that the detuning parameter @xmath10 tends to zero , where @xmath11 .",
    "thus in rwa an initial state of an atom plus one photon is degenerate in energy with the final state of the atom .",
    "an advantage of using degenerate atomic states is that one is not restricted to external interactions with frequencies close to the transition frequency .",
    "thus @xmath12 can be used for control , e.g. to vary the duration of time that the transferred population remains in the designated state , or to reduce the population leakage that occurs when the energy states are not fully degenerate . on the other hand rwa",
    "has the advantage that analytic solutions have been found when the detuning parameter is small , but finite .",
    "let us consider an @xmath0-state atom interacting with an external field , @xmath13 .",
    "the total hamiltonian for this system is @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath0 eigenstates , @xmath15 , and corresponding eigen - energies , @xmath16 , of @xmath17 are assumed to be known .",
    "the total wavefunction may be expanded in terms of the known eigenstates , namely , @xmath18 . with atomic units , using @xmath19 , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 , one then obtains @xcite , @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "these equations are exact for an @xmath0-state atom .",
    "we assume that the system is degenerate , namely that all the energies , @xmath24 , are the same . since the zero point of energy is arbitrary , one may generally set @xmath25 .",
    "these conditions give the coupled equations for our degenerate @xmath0-state system , namely , @xmath26 we additionally require that all of the @xmath27 have the same time dependence , e.g. @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a real , but otherwise arbitrary function of time . for this work",

    "thus the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath72 prevent complete transfer to the initially unoccupied state when they are unequal , and simply contribute an overall phase when they are equal .",
    "an interesting solution occurs when the ratio @xmath73 , see  @xcite .",
    "then eqs ( [ 2a - ansa ] ) take the form @xmath74 the corresponding occupation probabilities @xmath75 and @xmath76 are @xmath77    for this special value of @xmath78 the probability is completely transfered back and forth between the two states with the period @xmath79 as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "it can be easily shown that when @xmath80 reaches its maximum value at @xmath81 , a small deviation @xmath82 from the value @xmath83 in the ratio @xmath78 reduces @xmath84 from @xmath85 to @xmath86 .",
    "this can be used to estimate how sensitive this approach is to fluctuations in the strength of the external field , @xmath87 .",
    "the period of oscillation of the occupation probabilities is two times smaller than the period of oscillation of the radiation field since @xmath88 .",
    "complete population transfer occurs in general wherever the action , @xmath89 , is an integer multiple of @xmath90 .",
    "each cycle has a `` flat '' part where the probability value remains very close to the extreme values of 0 or 1 for an extended period of time ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "as we can see , the external radiation field with the ratio @xmath91 can be used to cause periodical population inversion of the electronic states ( a physical realization of a quantum controllable system ) .",
    "equations ( [ f9 ] ) can be expanded in a power series in the vicinity of the point @xmath92 , where @xmath80 reaches its first maximum . then @xmath84 can be accurately approximated by taking only first few terms in the series , which converges rapidly for @xmath93 .",
    "if one chooses the potential in the form @xmath94 , the first , second and third derivatives of the function @xmath84 are zero at @xmath95 , and @xmath96 hence the occupation probability @xmath84 in the vicinity of its maximum can be approximated by a @xmath97 degree polynomial .",
    "the polynomial approximation of eq.([f12 ] ) tells one how to choose the field frequency to provide a desired duration of the populated state . to obtain a duration @xmath98 of the populated state with a population leakage less than some critical value @xmath99 ,",

    "therefore , a radiation field with the wavelength from a few @xmath235 ( and the intensity of the order @xmath236 ) up to a few @xmath237 ( and the intensity of the order @xmath238 ) can be used for @xmath205 transitions in hydrogen .",
    "the probability of the multiphoton excitation to the @xmath221 state ( or any other state , including continuum ) also seems to be small for the range of the external field frequencies under consideration .",
    "our analytic approximation appears to be valid for @xmath205 transitions in hydrogen over a broad range of field frequencies .",
    "we have noted previously that the choice of the field frequency is a trade - off between two competing factors : reducing the population leakage and increasing the duration of the populated state . if wishes to obtain a long lasting populated state with very small leakage , it may be that both requirements for the system can not be met simultaneously for a single frequency radiation field . in this case",
    "it may be possible to use another form of the interaction potential .",
    "in particular , one may change the shape of the `` flat '' part of the probability ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ) by using different shapes for the external potential @xmath239 . for an arbitrary external potential the formulas for the occupation probabilities can be written in the form : @xmath240    a taylor series expansion can be used for choosing the shape of the external potential .",
    "for example , one can use the potential with the first non - vanishing derivative of the order higher than four to make the shape of the populated state even flatter .",
    "the derivatives can be calculated using the general formula for the n@xmath241 derivative of a composite function @xcite , which in this case takes the form @xmath242 where @xmath243 , @xmath244 , @xmath245 indicates summation over all solutions in non - negative integers of the equation @xmath246 and @xmath247 .    in principle , eqn.([gradshteyn ] ) tells us how to shape @xmath67 to control the population transfer . as one can see from eq.([gradshteyn ] ) , one may eliminate all terms up to the order @xmath248 by choosing the potential for which all derivatives up to the order @xmath249 are zero at the point @xmath95 .",
    "that will `` flatten '' the shape of the populated ( or depopulated ) state , i.e. allow one to use smaller frequency ( and , as a result , an increased duration of the state ) to achieve the same state of population leakage .",

    "state 2 is unoccupied before @xmath138 , and fully occupied after @xmath138 .    to obtain analytic solutions to eq.([ndegen ] ) for a 3-state atom , we imposed degeneracy on the 3-state manifold , e.g. by taking @xmath295 . if @xmath296 , then @xmath297 can be removed from eq([nexact ] ) by an overall phase transformation , @xmath298 .",
    "when the states are not degenerate @xmath299 , and the population transfer is incomplete .",
    "numerical calculations indicate that the population leakage varies as @xmath300 .",
    "the choice of the field frequency , @xmath12 , involves a trade - off between the duration of time the population remains in state 2 and the population leakage . the higher the frequency , @xmath12 , the smaller the population leakage , @xmath301 , but the shorter the duration time , @xmath98 , that the population remains in state 2 .",
    "this effect of population leakage is similar as that for a 2-state atom @xcite .",
    "numerical calculations indicate that this population leakage grows rapidly in time .",
    "in this work we have used the @xmath205 transition in hydrogen as an example of population transfer .",
    "the same approach can be used for any other atomic or molecular system that has a similar pattern of energy states ( two states located close one to another and far from the other states ) . as we have shown in eq.([delta p 2 ] ) , for an external field with a single frequency @xmath12 , the difference between the exact calculations and the analytic approximation varies as @xmath231 for @xmath302 , and does not depend on the internal structure of the atom or molecule .",
    "this feature opens the possibility for using different systems with different values of the transition frequency , @xmath211 and different ranges for the field frequency , @xmath12 .",
    "a downside of analyzing more complex atomic or molecular systems is that analytic expressions for the orbital functions are not always available .",
    "then genetic algorithms ( ga ) may be used to choose a shape for the external potential , @xmath67 .",
    "the application of ga with active feedback to the selective breaking and making chemical bonds in polyatomic molecules has been discussed in detail by rabitz _",
    "et al _ @xcite , and tested experimentally @xcite ) .",
    "as in any optimization scheme , the effectiveness of the ga increases significantly when the initial value of the parameter close to the optimal one is chosen .",
    "one might combine our method with ga using approximate analytic orbital functions to choose the `` starting '' form of the potential , estimate @xmath98 and @xmath99 , and then employ the ga scheme .    for @xmath205 transitions in hydrogen , sources of the microwave radiation with corresponding intensities",
    "may now be available , which can be used to test our model .",
    "metastable excited @xmath303 atoms could interact with a low frequency ( e.g. microwave ) radiation .",
    "since the lifetime of the @xmath219 state is much shorter than the @xmath218 state , the population of the @xmath219 state may be monitored by observing photons emitted in @xmath304 transitions . in these experiments",
    "the smallness of the lamb shift requires the use of the temperatures below the @xmath305 to exclude the thermal transitions between the states .    in this work",
    "we have also considered transitions amplitudes and probabilities in a @xmath8-state atom with degenerate states .",
    "we also assumed that the interaction matrix elements , @xmath72 all have a common time dependence .",
    "in realistic atomic systems , energy states are seldom , if ever , exactly degenerate . also states outside @xmath8-state manifold usually exist .",
    "consequently , use of our results is restricted to external fields with frequencies in the range , @xmath306 . here",
    "@xmath307 is the energy splitting of the nearly degenerate states , and @xmath308 is the energy difference between the @xmath8-state manifold and the closest state in energy outside the manifold .",
    "it is instructive to compare our 3-state results to simpler 2-state results @xcite .",
    "the equations for a @xmath7-state atom may be recovered from our @xmath8-state equations by taking @xmath309 and @xmath310 to zero , which corresponds to @xmath311 ( with any @xmath312 ) , as may be understood from eq([3trial ] ) . for the @xmath7-state atom",
    "it has been shown @xcite that @xmath54 may be expressed in terms of eigenstates @xmath53 via the relation , @xmath313 , where @xmath314 .",
    "this matrix may be inverted to give the population amplitudes , @xmath315 $ ] and @xmath316 $ ] , where @xmath58 is the determinant of @xmath59 .",
    "a simple solution occurs when @xmath317 , namely , @xmath318      =   \\",
    "e^{-i \\epsilon a(t ) } \\cos(a(t))$ ] and @xmath319      = - i e^{-i \\epsilon a(t ) } \\sin(a(t ) ) $ ] .",
    "note that @xmath64 .",
    "one may then simply determine the conditions under which the population of state 2 , @xmath320 , takes on any desired value at time @xmath68 . if @xmath70 , it is easily shown that @xmath321 .",
    "thus the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath72 prevent complete transfer to the initially unoccupied state when @xmath322 and @xmath323 are unequal , and , when they are equal , they simply contribute an overall phase . when @xmath324 any value of @xmath320 between 0 and 1 can be found .",
    "in particular , @xmath325 if @xmath326 .",
    "this allowed value of @xmath162 for complete transfer to state 2 differs from the allowed values given in eq([qnumbers ] ) for degenerate 3-state atoms . by comparison to a 2-state atom the conditions for complete transfer are generally more complex in a @xmath8-state atom , as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "for example , complete population transfer can occur in a 3-state atom when @xmath327 . in both cases , however , the duration of time spent in the transferred state can be controlled by adjusting the time dependence of the external field .",
    "also if the states are not quite degenerate then population leakage occurs . for a harmonic @xmath67 the population leakage in a 2-state atom varies as @xmath328 . for @xmath205 transitions in atomic hydrogen complete population control",
    "can be nearly achieved in this manner using a radiation field with wavelengths ( and intensities ) ranging from a few @xmath235 ( with about @xmath329 w / cm@xmath6 ) up to a few @xmath237 ( with about @xmath331 w / cm@xmath6 ) . at wavelengths below a few @xmath235 coupling to nearby @xmath103 atomic states",
    "can be significant , and this @xmath7-state model breaks down .",
    "while we have not provided calculations in this work for specific experiments , some general guidelines for experimental tests and applications are evident .",
    "first , the model must be valid , so that the frequency of the external interaction is limited by @xmath332 .",
    "if the external interaction varies harmonically , @xmath267 , then the first line of eq([qnumbers ] ) imposes a constraint between @xmath333 and @xmath12 , namely , @xmath334 . for a harmonic interaction the duration of the time , @xmath98 , that the population remains in state 2 varies inversely with @xmath12 ; the higher the frequency , @xmath12 , the smaller the time the population remains in state 2 .",
    "our degenerate 3-state model can be applied to systems with dipole selection rules .",
    "a dipole selection rule can correspond to @xmath281 .",
    "transfer from state 1 to state 2 ( which is the dipole forbidden transition ) is complete at time @xmath68 if the two allowed transition matrix elements , @xmath335 and @xmath310 , are equal in absolute magnitude and @xmath336 . in some atomic systems",
    "state 2 could decay , with a lifetime , @xmath337 , to another state outside the degenerate manifold and be lost .",
    "such loss can be controlled by adjusting @xmath12 .",
    "our model also rests on degeneracy .",
    "if the three states are not degenerate the transfer of population to state 2 is incomplete .",
    "we call this population leakage . as discussed above this population leakage may be minimized by using high frequency external interactions .",
    "i.e. @xmath338 , but at a cost to duration of time , @xmath98 , the population remains in state 2 .",
    "using nearly degenerate states , the duration time , @xmath98 , can be further controlled @xcite by adjusting the shape of @xmath67 . as mentioned in section iii for example , the transfer is complete , instantaneous and permanent when @xmath339 . such a quick , hard pulse",
    "is called @xcite a kick. two practical limitations on this ideal model are the impossibility of producing a signal that varies as @xmath340 , and the existence of an infinitely wide spectrum of high frequency components with frequencies @xmath341 in the fourier spectrum of @xmath340 .",
    "fortunately these two difficulties can both be addressed by using kicks of finite width in time . in some cases",
    "it may be possible to design a kick so that its duration is short compared to any other changes in the system , so that a finite kick may be sensibly represented by @xmath340 .",
    "if , in addition , the energy states outside the ( nearly ) degenerate manifold have a large energy gap @xmath308 , then it may be possible that @xmath332 and our model may be applicable .",
    "applying @xmath342 to nearly degenerate atomic systems leads to the gedanken question , what happens when one tries to force the transition to occur within a small time interval about @xmath68 in a degenerate quantum system where @xmath343 is large ?",
    "we note that at sufficiently high @xmath12 all bound states in the atomic elements become nearly degenerate . hence",
    ", if one can deal with high energy continuum states , our approach might be useful in applications involving fourth generation synchrotrons that produce intense high frequency fields .",
    "an extension of this method might also used for control transitions in high rydberg states @xcite , including adiabatic rapid passage @xcite .",
    "rwa is used to describe coherent storage of information in photonic states @xcite .",
    "the approach developed here may be useful for modeling information transmission and storage in atomic states @xcite in a new way .",
    "features that occur when degenerate states are used and the connection to quantum time ordering are discussed elsewhere in this book  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that in a @xmath0-state atom with degenerate energies , electron population is completely transferred via an external interaction at a designated time , @xmath68 , as example we show for @xmath344 and @xmath3 .",
    "a new analytical solution of two coupled channel equations has been found that enables one to temporally control the electron population of @xmath218 and @xmath219 states in hydrogen by using a time varying external field .",
    "in addition , the population leakage can both be easily estimated , and than be further controlled by changing the shape of the external field . for 3-state atoms from an initially occupied state ( state 1 ) to a designated initially unoccupied state ( state 2 ) under two conditions .",
    "the first condition for complete transfer is that the ratio of the matrix elements of the external interaction , @xmath72,satisfy @xmath345 , and @xmath346 .",
    "the second condition is that at @xmath138 the action area of @xmath67 satisfy @xmath347 , where we have set @xmath348 . here",
    "@xmath256 and @xmath257 are integers such that @xmath259 and @xmath349 , where @xmath261 and @xmath262 are any odd integers .",
    "the duration of time the transferred population remains in state 2 can be controlled either by varying the frequency , @xmath12 , of the external potential , or by varying the shape of @xmath67 .",
