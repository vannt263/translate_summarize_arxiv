    "in @xcite we used the @xcite equations to derive the projected second velocity moments for an anisotropic ( three - integral ) axisymmetric stellar system with the density described via the multi - gaussian expansion ( mge , @xcite ) .",
    "we stated in note 5 that the components of the proper motion dispersion tensor can be can be written via single quadratures without the need for special functions , and provided a reference software implementation , called the jeans anisotropic mge ( jam ) method .",
    "however only the line - of - sight component was given in the paper .",
    "for completeness we provide all expressions in this addendum .",
    "we adopt identical notation and coordinates system as in @xcite , and we refer the reader to that paper for details and definitions . following the approach outlined in note 5 of the paper , we use the general formulas ] ( a5 ) of @xcite to write any of the six projected second moments as @xmath0\\right\\ }    } {    { \\left(1-\\mathcal{c } u^2\\right ) \\sqrt{\\mathcal{e }         \\left[1-(1-q_j^2)u^2\\right ] } }    } { \\mathrm{d}}u , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 stand for any of the three projected coordinates @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and we defined @xmath6    the line - of - sight velocity second moment @xmath7 given in eq .",
    "( 28 ) of @xcite is obtained from equation  ( [ eq : second_moment ] ) with @xmath8 the second moment @xmath9 of the proper motion in a direction parallel to the projected galaxy major axis is obtained with @xmath10 ^ 2+\\sin^2 i/(2\\mathcal{e})\\}.\\ ] ] the second moment @xmath11 of the proper motion in a direction parallel to the the projected symmetry axis is obtained from @xmath12 , which implies @xmath13 the expressions for the cross terms are @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16.\\ ] ] the expressions for @xmath9 and @xmath11 where also recently given in @xcite , who presented an application of the jam method to proper motions measurements .",
    "to test the formalism of the previous section we compared the six second moments predicted by the jam method against the ones measured by direct summation from the n - body particles of two realistic galaxy simulations from @xcite , to which we refer the reader for details . inside each projected pixels , with coordinates @xmath17 and @xmath18 particles , the second moments are @xmath19    to reduce the noise on the moments maps , we used the voronoi binning method @xcite to group pixels in such a way that every bin contains about 5000 n - body particles .",
    "we then used the software of @xcite to fit an mge model to the surface brightness of the simulation .",
    "the mge parameters were used as input for the jam model ( equation  ( [ eq : second_moment ] ) ) to predict all six projected second moments .",
    "the model is not fitted to the data and it has no free parameters !",
    "we fixed the inclination @xmath20 to the known value and the anisotropy @xmath21 to the average values from the simulation particles ( table c1 of @xcite ) .    considering the simplicity of the model assumptions and the lack of free parameters in our test , the agreement between the realistic simulations and the jam model is _ striking _ , confirming the usefulness of the approach .",
    "this suggest that the method may be applicable to the interpretation of the observations from future generations of proper motions surveys ( generally using a maximum likelihood approach for discrete data )",
    ". it can be especially useful to break the degeneracies that affect some of the quantities obtained from projected kinematics alone ( e.g.  the dark matter profiles ) ."
