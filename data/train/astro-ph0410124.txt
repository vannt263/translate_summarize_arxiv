    "the sloan digital sky survey has revealed the most distant quasars known @xcite .  observations on 2002",
    "january 29 easily detected three quasars at redshifts 5.82 , 6.28 , and 5.99 in brief , @xmath3 58 ks , acis - s observations @xcite .",
    "the latter , sdssp j130608.26 + 035626.3 ( hereafter , j1306 ) , was followed up with a 120 ks  observation , based on the claim by @xcite of an associated jet .",
    "@xcite subsequently identified the x - rays attributed to a jet with a faint galaxy , and the present observation clearly confirms the galaxy identification .    from the optical observations",
    ", j1306 is a broad line quasar , whose spectrum contains ly@xmath4+nv emission , and various intervening absorption systems @xcite .",
    "this is a general characteristic of the 12 quasars now known at z @xmath3 6 @xcite . from the optical absolute magnitude m@xmath5 = @xmath226.93 @xcite",
    ", the central black hole mass must be at least 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 , unless it is emitting at much greater than the eddington luminosity .",
    "we report here a study of the x - ray variability and spectrum of j1306 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of distant quasars is of interest to search for possible evolution of the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) emission mechanism , which might give clues to the history of the formation and the fueling of the central massive black hole . with agns",
    "widely inferred to make up the bulk of the diffuse x - ray background , it remains to define the model of quasar evolution and of the relative numbers of absorbed and unabsorbed emitters that will reproduce the shape of the 210 kev diffuse x - ray background to the precision measured by @xcite .",
    "it remains possible that a high fidelity spectral fit must also consider a contribution from quasars with concave curvature in their spectrum from 5 to 40 kev , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "previous measurements of radio - quiet quasars in the redshift range 2.644.35 gave photon spectral indices @xmath8 2.0 @xcite , with the exception of an index 1.4 reported by @xcite for rx j122135.6 + 280613 at z=3.305 .",
    "@xcite report a mean index @xmath9 for 56 _ rosat _ quasars with z @xmath10 2.0 .",
    "the result reported here provides an example at z=5.99 with @xmath11= 1.86 .",
    "j1306 was observed with the back - illuminated s3 ccd of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) at the nominal aim point for approximately 118 ks live time starting on 2003 november 29 .",
    "the  data were reduced in the standard manner using ciao version 3.0.2 and the latest calibration database ( caldb ) release ( ver . 2.26 ; released 2004 february 2 ) which incorporates an improved acis contamination calibration file and corrects a one - channel offset in the acis s3 response matrix .",
    "the contamination correction is required since the degradation of the effective acis throughput is strongly energy dependent .",
    "only events for _ asca _ grades 0 , 2 - 4 , and 6 were retained for analysis .",
    "we restrict the energy range to 0.57.0 kev , as the background rises steeply below and above those limits . however , no photons greater than 5.1 kev were detected .",
    "we applied `` corr_tgain.1.0 '' to the event list to correct the measured x - ray energy for the secular gain drift which is primarily caused by gradual deterioration of the charge transfer inefficiency of the acis ccds .",
    "we checked that no background flares occurred during the observation .",
    "we also inspected the individual photon arrival times from the quasar and there is no evidence for transient phenomena affecting the data .",
    "figure  [ fig : field ] shows the field within 1  of the quasar .",
    "cxou  130609.31 + 035643.5 , a point source approximately 24  to the northeast from j1306 , is the faint _",
    "i_-band galaxy found by @xcite and now confirmed as the correct identification rather than the suggestion of a jet @xcite . figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] shows the light curve for j1306 during the earlier short observation ( obsid 3358 ) and the present long observation ( obsid 3966 ) .",
    "we detected 18 photons between 0.5 and 7.0 kev in 8.16 ks during the 2002 january observation .",
    "however , based on the counting rate of the present observation , only 8 photons are expected .",
    "the probability of observing 18 photons when 8 are expected is only 0.1% .",
    "therefore , this suggests that we see intrinsic variability in the source between these two epochs .",
    "weak evidence of variability within the current observation would require better statistics to confirm .",
    "note that the elapsed time of 22 months between the two observations corresponds to a time scale of 3.15 months in the source frame .",
    "circle indicates a 1  radius around j1306 .",
    "the pointlike source cxou  130609.31 + 035643.5 is the faint _",
    "i_-band galaxy found by @xcite .",
    "several other weak sources appear in the region , and they would bias the measured @xmath12 in an observation with much poorer angular resolution . ]",
    "light curve of j1306 during the short observation ( obsid 3358 ) and the present observation ( obsid 3966 ) .",
    "the gap between the two observations is 22 months .",
    "we plot the total number of photons between 0.5 and 7 kev , within a 3 radius of the quasar , sorted into 3 ks bins . ]",
    "the x - ray spectrum was extracted using a circular region with a 3  radius centered on the brightest pixel .",
    "the background was taken from an annular region centered on the quasar ( inner radius of 28  and outer radius of 80 ) that is free of obvious sources . the number of net source counts in the 0.57.0 kev band after background subtraction is 118 photons ( 122 photons detected in total and used for the spectral analysis ) , giving a net count rate of @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "this is consistent with a point response , where we find 114 x - rays within a 25 diameter circle , which will enclose 95% of photons at 1.5 kev @xcite , an energy near the median of our spectrum .",
    "the photons were grouped , using the ciao tool _ dmgroup _ , into 100 ev bins . because of the small number of photons in most bins , the cash statistic @xcite was used as the figure of merit in spectral fits performed within xspec @xcite .",
    "we fit the spectrum to a power law , with galactic absorption fixed at its measured value of @xmath15 h - atoms @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : pow ] .",
    "the fit is obviously adequate , and gives an energy spectral index @xmath17 0.96 @xmath0 0.18 .",
    "the galactic absorption - corrected flux in the observed 0.57.0 kev band is @xmath18 @xmath19 . for @xmath20 = 71 km  s@xmath21  mpc@xmath21 , @xmath22 = 0.27 , and @xmath23 = 0.73",
    ", we derive an x - ray luminosity of 2.2@xmath24 @xmath25 emitted in the source frame 210.0 kev band .",
    "the residuals apparent below 1 kev hint at the possibility of redshifted fe - k emission .",
    "if we add a narrow gaussian line to the fit model , with the line energy fixed at 0.916 kev for redshifted neutral iron and the line @xmath26 fixed at the intrinsic s3 resolution at the source position on the ccd , we derive the fit shown in figure  [ fig : line ] .",
    "the power - law energy index is slightly flatter , @xmath4=0.86 @xmath0 0.20 , and the power - law normalization decreases by about 10% .",
    "the cash statistic decreases by about 3.3 .",
    "although this would formally be 93% significance @xcite , @xcite point out that the likelihood ratio test is not valid for such an additive component to a spectral model .",
    "the chance that poisson statistics leads to the residuals between 800 and 1000 ev in figure  [ fig : pow ] is 12.7% , so clearly further confirmation is needed for this feature .",
    "if real , the equivalent width of the the fe - k emission line would be approximately 114 ev .",
    "figure  [ fig : contours ] shows the joint contours for the x - ray slope @xmath27 and the amplitude of the fe - k line .",
    "we compute @xmath28 according to the original definition of @xcite , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the x - ray flux density at 2 kev , @xmath31= 4.8@xmath3210@xmath33 hz , and @xmath34 is the optical flux density at 2500  , @xmath35=1.2@xmath3210@xmath36 hz .",
    "we calculated the optical monochromatic luminosity at rest - frame 2500   using the observed optical flux @xcite and assuming a power law optical continuum slope with @xmath37 = 0.5 .",
    "this yields a value for @xmath28 of 1.70 .",
    "this result is consistent with the values determined in the earlier observations , with small differences due to the fact that the previous conversion of counts to flux density merely assumed an energy index of 0.7 or 1.0 by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , and that the source flux in the present observation is only half that in 2002 january .",
    "we note that an x - ray flux extraction circle of 60@xmath38 radius would lead to a decrease in @xmath28 to 1.61 , because of the inclusion of flux from other nearby x - ray sources , principally cxou  130609.31 + 035643.5 , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : field ] .",
    "in this letter , we present the first  x - ray spectrum of a z @xmath39 6 quasar . the values for the energy index and the @xmath28 derived from this  spectrum of j1306 are consistent with the values found for lower redshift radio - quiet quasars @xcite . specifically , our result for @xmath28 is consistent with no strong evolution in @xmath28 for optically selected radio - quiet quasars out to z @xmath3 6 .",
    "a preprint by @xcite gives an _ xmm _ spectrum of sdss j1030 + 0524 , a quasar at z=6.30 .",
    "they reach very similar conclusions as to the spectrum and luminosity , and implications for lack of evolution . while _",
    "xmm _ affords higher statistics , the 45  extraction radius gives less certainty on the precise origin of the flux .",
    "thus the two observations are somewhat complementary .",
    "x - ray studies of high - redshift quasars reveal the conditions in the immediate vicinity of their supermassive black holes .",
    "our spectrum of j1306 hints at the presence of an fe - k emission line .",
    "our poorly determined ew of 114 ev is consistent with the scatter in compilations by @xcite and @xcite which would extrapolate to predict a @xmath370 ev ew for a radio - quiet quasar of the 2@xmath3210@xmath40 ergs s@xmath21 luminosity .",
    "recent near - infrared spectroscopy of three other high redshift sdss quasars ( z @xmath41 5.7 ) with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "@xcite clearly detected fe ii emission lines at 2200 - 2600   ( rest frame ) and the keck - ii observations of @xcite have detected si iv , c iv , mg ii , and the 2900 - 3000   fe line complex . both results indicate that the strength of the line complex , as well as the fe ii / mg ii ratio , is comparable to that of lower redshift quasars .",
    "the results of near - infrared studies such as these as well as the results of x - ray studies such as the one presented here and elsewhere @xcite are beginning to indicate that there apparently is no strong evolution in the broadband agn emission mechanism with redshift out to z @xmath3 6 .",
    "this conclusion , if confirmed with a larger sample , implies that formation of the central black hole engines can be completed in less than 1 gyr after the big bang , with the inference that a massive galaxy in which they are imbedded has also formed .",
    "therefore , in order to address the question of which , if any , of the observed quasar properties evolve with time , we must probe deeper still to identify quasars at even higher redshifts .",
    "this might best be done with the  deep surveys , e.g. , by identifying the objects with extreme x - ray - to - optical flux ratios found by @xcite .",
