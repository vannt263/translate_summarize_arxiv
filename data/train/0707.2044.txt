    "the relaxor ferroelectricity in complex perovskites like pbmg@xmath0nb@xmath1o@xmath2 ( pmn ) has been intensively investigated since the early work by smolenskii and agranovskaya @xcite and the interest in this class of dielectrics underwent a revival after the pioneering work by park and shrout @xcite , who discovered ultrahigh strain and giant piezoelectric response in pbmg@xmath0nb@xmath1o@xmath2-pbtio@xmath8 and pbzn@xmath0nb@xmath1o@xmath2-pbtio@xmath8 single crystals .",
    "the relaxor ferroelectrics exhibit a high and broad peak in the temperature dependent permittivity whose position remarkably shifts to higher temperatures with increasing measuring frequency .",
    "the peculiar dielectric properties are caused by a wide dielectric relaxation which broadens and slows down on cooling.@xcite the relaxation originates from the dynamics of polar clusters ( 1 - 6 nm in diameter ) , which develop below the burns temperature t@xmath9 ( 600 - 700k in various complex perovskites)@xcite and it is believed that the broad distribution of relaxation frequencies has its origin in random fields and random forces as a consequence of chemical disorder in the perovskite b sites occupied by two cations of different valence ( e.g. mg@xmath10 and nb@xmath11 in pmn).@xcite therefore it appears that the degree of chemical order of b - site cations plays a crucial role in the dielectric response of perovskite relaxors .",
    "it was shown that the b cations in pb(b@xmath12b@xmath13)o@xmath8 ( b=mg , ni , zn and b=nb , ta ) perovskites reveal the 1:1 order in small domains ( 2 - 9 nm ) dispersed in a disordered perovskite matrix . in",
    "the 1:1 ordered domains with general formula pb(@xmath14)o@xmath2 the @xmath15 sub - lattice is occupied solely by b ",
    "cations , but the @xmath16 one contains a random distribution of b and of the remaining b ",
    "cations in the ratio 2:1.@xcite in this description the ordered structure of pmn , for example , can be represented as pb(mg@xmath1nb@xmath0)@xmath17nb@xmath17o@xmath2.@xcite first - principles - based simulations have shown that the polar nanoregions appear predominantly in chemically ordered regions.@xcite the size of 1:1 ordered domains can be enlarged by suitable doping or sometimes by longer annealing the ceramics .",
    "for example , in pmn the ordered domains were enlarged by two orders of magnitude ( up to 500 nm ) by 30% la doping and simultaneously the permittivity was remarkably reduced to 200 ( from @xmath1820000 in pure pmn ) , but a weak dielectric relaxation still remained present.@xcite    in closely related pbmg@xmath0ta@xmath1o@xmath2 ( pmt ) ceramics the 1:1 ordering can be achieved by proper high - temperature heat treatment , but the highly ordered samples still contain a large volume of disordered anti - phase boundaries and the 1:1 domains do not coarsen over @xmath1810 nm . more pronounced domain growth ( up to @xmath1840 nm ) and up to 95 vol .",
    "% ordering has been observed in pmt that contain small admixtures of pbzro@xmath8.@xcite nevertheless , in spite of the domain growth , only small influence of the ordering degree on the dielectric relaxation was observed - magnitude and temperature of the maximum permittivity ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) slightly reduce with ordering.@xcite it therefore appears that the randomness of the ordered structure in the @xmath16 sublattice is the critical factor for appearance of the relaxor ferroelectric behavior which inhibits the normal ferroelectric coupling@xcite rather than the chemical cluster size .",
    "numerous publications exist about the dielectric properties of pmt,@xcite however , all the measurements were performed only up to 1mhz and mostly below room temperature . for understanding the relaxation behavior , higher - frequency dielectric spectra at temperatures above room temperature , especially near and above the burns temperature @xmath4 ,",
    "are necessary .",
    "we will report here about dielectric spectra measurements between 100hz and 9ghz at temperatures up to 490@xmath3 and about the dielectric response in the thz and infrared ( ir ) spectral range ( 0.1 - 90thz ) for 20 - 900@xmath3 .",
    "particularly the thz and ir spectra near @xmath4 are of importance since in several other relaxors we observed that the dielectric relaxation moves from radio - frequency range near @xmath20 up to the thz range near @xmath4 and merges with polar phonons above @xmath4.@xcite moreover , the local ferroelectric instability in the polar clusters was indicated in the ir spectra by an unstable polar optic phonon which partially softens on heating to @xmath4 and hardens above it.@xcite the question to what extend this behavior is general needs still to be investigated not only near and above @xmath4 , but also below @xmath20 .",
    "simultaneously , it will be of interest to study the influence of the 1:1 order degree on the ir spectra especially above @xmath4 . for this purpose we processed and investigated three types of pmt ceramics of the order from 10 to 90% .",
    "it is worth to note that except for the very recent paper on plzt@xcite , above @xmath4 no ir reflectivity spectra of relaxors were reported up to now .",
    "to achieve a different degree of the 1:1 order in pmt ceramics we added 5% of pbzro@xmath8 into pmt .",
    "details of the ceramics processing were described in ref.@xcite .",
    "the as - sintered ceramics ( at 1230@xmath21c for 2 hours ) have less than 10% order ( domain size @xmath183 - 5 nm ) while the ceramics annealed for 1 hour at 1350@xmath21c exhibit 15% ordering ( domain size @xmath183 - 5 nm ) and the 64-hours annealed ceramics show 90% order and ordered domain size of about 150 nm .",

    "we have observed 15 modes at 20@xmath3 , which reasonably agrees with the expectation .",
    "the fact that only 11 modes are seen at 300@xmath3 , can be explained by higher damping of the modes at rt , which may cause overlapping of some modes .",
    "the situation at high temperatures requires additional discussion .",
    "no polar clusters are expected above @xmath78 so that only 4 ir modes are permitted for the space group @xmath6 , but we resolved 8 polar modes in the ir spectra up to 900@xmath3 .",
    "factor group analysis for the @xmath6 structure assumes 1:1 chemical ordering in the b sites@xcite in small chemical clusters ( 3 - 150 nm in pmt)@xcite , while the rest of the sample volume ( e.g. 90% in the 10% ordered sample ) remains chemically disordered , i.e. the mg@xmath10 and ta@xmath11 cations are randomly dispersed over both @xmath15 and @xmath16 sites .",

    "let us mention the result of the ins experiment on pmn single crystal by vakhrushev and shapiro.@xcite they observed splitting of the to1 mode also far above @xmath4 and explained it by a two mode behavior due to the chemical disorder .",
    "however , their results were not confirmed by other groups performing ins experiments on relaxors .",
    "our pmt ceramics contain 5% of zr and the structural studies have shown,@xcite that the @xmath15 sublattice is occupied only by ta cations , while all mg , zr and rest of ta cations occupy the @xmath16 sublattice .",

    "this mode stems from the raman active mode@xcite of @xmath80 symmetry above @xmath4 and it has @xmath62 symmetry at low temperatures .",
    "it becomes resolved at low temperatures due to the breaking of local symmetry as well as due to the lower phonon damping of both to1 components .",
    "similar temperature behavior of all three phonons was observed in pmn , pst , plzt and also in other relaxor solid solutions@xcite and it seems that it is a general behavior in all lead - based perovskite relaxors .",
    "let us mention that we observed no overdamping of to1 phonon below @xmath4 frequently seen in ins spectra of other relaxors , which is called phonon `` waterfall effect''.@xcite to1 phonon is underdamped at all temperatures indicating that the `` waterfall effect '' in the ins spectra is just an apparent effect due to a coupling of heavily damped soft optic mode with some other excitation , e.g. acoustic phonon branches.@xcite    gvasaliya @xmath88@xcite observed in ins spectra ( but did not explain ) a remarkable change of the vibrational state density in the range of 5080@xmath64 on cooling from 300 to 50@xmath3 .",
    "this change could be connected with the hardening of the optic @xmath86 modes on cooling seen in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .",
    "ir transmission spectra of the thin film yield slightly different mode frequencies ( see solid dots in fig .  [ fig7 ] ) and moreover , the to1 mode is split at all temperatures up to 900@xmath3 .",
    "different mode frequencies as well as different temperatures of the to1 splitting in ceramics and thin films can be caused by the strain which induces anisotropy in the film .",
    "nevertheless , we observed that the film is rather relaxed , strain is smaller than 0.1% , therefore the strain effect on the phonon spectra should be small .",
    "the film is mostly ( 111 ) oriented and along the same direction is oriented also the spontaneous polarization in rhombohedral phase of pmt .",
    "if we assume that the local symmetry in polar clusters is also rhombohedral and that the @xmath62 modes are ir active for polarization of ir radiation perpendicular to ( 111 ) , i.e. in the plane of the thin films , than it is clear that the intensity of @xmath62 modes should be enhanced in ir spectra of our thin film .",

    "we note that the accuracy of the phonon frequency determination is different in various experimental techniques used .",
    "ir reflectivity of ceramics above 50@xmath64 is less accurate than the fir transmission spectra of thin films .",
    "therefore the mode frequencies above 50@xmath64 in thin film are determined more accurately .",

    "the thz transmission spectra of the ceramics below 30@xmath64 are more accurate than the fir transmission spectra of the thin films , therefore we believe more to the lowest frequency @xmath62 mode obtained from the thz spectra of ceramic samples ( especially below 400@xmath3 ) . simultaneously it is probable that the @xmath62 mode is stiffened in the thin film due to small strain ,",
    "as frequently observed e.g. in sto thin films.@xcite    second reason for different frequency of the @xmath62 mode in ceramics and thin films can be also different strength of relaxation mode in ceramics and films .",
    "the relaxation mode expresses the dynamics of polar clusters , i.e. their flipping and breathing .",

    "[ fig2 ] and  [ fig6 ] and it is manifested by the highest permittivity and losses near 1thz close below @xmath4 ( not shown in the figures ) . below 150@xmath3 the relaxation does not contribute to the thz spectra anymore so that the @xmath62 symmetry phonon mode is well resolved at low temperatures ( e.g. at 20@xmath3 spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "permittivity in the film is lower than in the ceramics .",
    "it means that the dielectric strength of the relaxation is higher in ceramics than in the film and the relaxation frequency is lower in the ceramics than in the film .",
    "thz and ir spectra were fit below 40@xmath64 with one effective mode , but because of different relaxation frequency also the peak in @xmath89 seen as @xmath62 mode in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] can be different in both kinds of pmt samples .",
    "nevertheless , it seems that the burns temperature ( i.e. splitting temperature of the to1 mode ) is different in ceramics ( @xmath18 900@xmath3 ) and in the thin pmt film ( above 900@xmath3 ) . in disordered pmt single crystals , other authors@xcite found @xmath4 close below 600@xmath3 .",
    "the low - frequency dielectric studies of pmt ceramics show @xmath4 even only 430@xmath3 ( estimated from the linear fit of 1/@xmath90 ) , which was independent of the degree of chemical order.@xcite nevertheless , note that these dielectric measurements were performed only below 500@xmath3 , i.e far below the expected @xmath4 .",
    "therefore we claim that different values of @xmath4 published by various authors can be caused both by different sensitivity of various experimental techniques as well as by different degree of chemical order .",
    "further experiments are necessary for distinguishing , which factor is more important .",
    "broad - band dielectric spectra from 100 hz to 90 thz revealed a dielectric relaxation which appears below the burns temperature @xmath4 close to the soft phonon mode frequency near 1 thz .",
    "the relaxation expresses dynamics of polar clusters and it slows down on cooling from the thz region through mw and radio - frequency region and simultaneously broadens anomalously giving rise to frequency independent losses at low temperatures .",
    "the relaxation frequency is only slightly influenced by the degree of chemical order in the perovskite b sites . in ceramic samples",
    "the to1 phonon shows splitting below @xmath4 due to the local breaking of the cubic symmetry in polar clusters . in the thin film",
    "the to1 phonon is split at all investigated temperatures below 900@xmath3 .",
    "both @xmath86 and @xmath62 components of the to1 mode remarkably harden below 300 - 400@xmath3 indicating their assignment to ferroelectric soft modes inside the polar clusters .",
    "twice higher number of polar modes than expected from the factor group analysis for the @xmath6 cubic structure was observed above @xmath4 .",
    "this discrepancy was accounted for by the chemical disorder in the perovskite b sites . on the other hand ,",
    "we have shown that the degree of chemical order has insignificant influence on the phonon frequencies .",
    "slightly different phonon frequencies in chemically disordered pmt thin film ( in comparison to ceramics ) can be explained by different relaxation frequency which overlaps the @xmath62 mode as well as by different spectral techniques used in the study of the thin film and bulk samples .",
    "finally we conclude that the observed behavior of the dielectric relaxation as well as of the soft phonons appears the same for all lead - based relaxor ferroelectrics with the perovskite structure so far studied .",

    "<S> the relaxation appears below burns temperature @xmath4 in the thz range , slows down on cooling through the microwave and mhz range and anomalously broadens . </S>",
    "<S> the shortest and longest relaxation times of the distribution of relaxation times follow arrhenius and vogel - fulcher law , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of b - site order has only a small influence on the parameters of the dielectric relaxation and almost no influence on the phonon parameters . </S>",
