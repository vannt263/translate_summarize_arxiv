    "in the more than ten years since the first discoveries ( smail et al .  1997 ; barger et al .  1998 ; hughes et al .  1998 ; eales et al",
    "1999 ) of distant submillimeter galaxies were made using the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ; holland et al .",
    "1999 ) on the single - dish james clerk maxwell telescope , we have learned a great deal about these sources and their contribution to the 850  @xmath12 m background light .",
    "we now know the background is dominated by sources with 850  @xmath12 m fluxes near 1  mjy ( blain et al .",
    "1999 ; cowie et al .  2002 ; knudsen et al .",
    "in addition , stacking analyses suggest that much of this light arises from galaxies near redshift one ( wang et al .  2006 ; serjeant et al .",
    "the large positional uncertainties of the scuba sources make direct spectroscopic measurements of potential optical counterparts time - consuming and ambiguous ( barger et al .",
    "however , many ( @xmath13% ; barger et al .  2000 ; ivison et al .  2002 ; chapman et al .",
    "2003b ) of the scuba sources with 850  @xmath12 m fluxes above 5  mjy have 1.4  ghz counterparts whose positions are known with subarcsecond accuracy .",
    "the optical and near - infrared ( nir ) counterparts to many of these have been spectroscopically identified , most of which are found to lie in the redshift range @xmath14 ( chapman et al .  2003a , 2005 ) .",
    "throughout the redshift range @xmath15 the submillimeter sources dominate the universal star formation history ( e.g. , chapman et al .",
    "2005 ; wang et al .",
    "the key questions are whether this continues to higher redshifts , and how high in redshift one must go before one finds that smaller galaxies are dominating the universal star formation history .",
    "if giant submillimeter galaxies still make up the bulk of the star formation at very high redshifts ( @xmath16 or more ) , this could pose a severe challenge to the cold dark matter models of galaxy growth . at present",
    "there are only a very small number of spectroscopically identified submillimeter galaxies at @xmath17 , with the current highest redshifts being at @xmath18 ( capak et al .",
    "2008 ; coppin et al .",
    "however , this may in large part be an observational selection effect .",
    "first , unlike the submillimeter with its negative @xmath19-correction , the radio dims at higher redshifts .",
    "even at @xmath20  mjy roughly @xmath21% of the sources do not have strong radio counterparts .",
    "since these sources can not be spatially localized , there is no simple route to obtaining a redshift .",
    "second , it is the high - redshift sources that are most likely to be omitted from the spectroscopic samples , since they are likely to be optically fainter .",
    "thus , while it is clear that submillimeter galaxies could continue to dominate the star formation history at @xmath17 , we are still in the uncomfortable position of not knowing the exact positions or counterparts of most of the submillimeter sources that are likely to lie at these redshifts .    fortunately , the advent of the submillimeter array ( sma ; ho et al .",
    "2004 ) has allowed accurate positions to be obtained for some of these sources ( iono et al .",
    "2006 ; wang et al .  2007 ; younger et al .",
    "2007 ) . of particular interest is the source goods  850 - 5 , which may lie at a very high redshift ( e.g. , wang et al .  2007 , 2009 ;",

    "daddi et al .",
    "( 2009a ) place goods  850 - 5 at @xmath22 based on a possible identification of a single co line .",
    "all of the sma - detected sources are relatively bright , but it is now possible , with the improving sensitivity of the sma , to study more typical sources . in the present paper we report on sma observations of hdf  850.1 ( hughes et al .",
    "hdf  850.1 is the strongest submillimeter source in the hubble deep field - north ( hdf - n ) proper , and , as such , it can almost be considered as the prototypical scuba source .",
    "it was also among the first scuba - selected sources to be detected with millimeter wavelength interferometry , giving an accurate position with an uncertainty of about @xmath23 ( downes et al .",
    "it is a measure of the difficulty of identifying the scuba sources that , despite this measurement and the extremely deep optical , nir , and radio data available for the hdf - n , no convincing optical / nir counterpart has been found for hdf  850.1 . indeed ,",
    "several possible optical / nir counterparts have been suggested , with the most recent identification being put forward by dunlop et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "we shall show in the present paper that none of the previous optical / nir identifications is correct and that hdf  850.1 has no detectable optical or nir light .",
    "it is a weak radio source with detections at both 1.4 and 8.4  ghz , and it may also be detected at 24  @xmath12 m .",
    "overall , the far - infrared ( fir ) and radio spectral energy distributions ( seds ) would place hdf  850.1 at a redshift of just above @xmath24 , if its rest - frame sed is similar to that of low - redshift ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath25  km  s@xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "two full tracks of sma observations of hdf  850.1 were obtained in 2008 february and april with , respectively , eight antennas in the compact configuration and seven antennas in the compact - north configuration .",
    "the receivers were tuned such that the central frequency of the observations was at 345  ghz .",
    "callisto and ceres were used as flux calibrators , and 3c454.3 was used as the bandpass calibrator .",
    "quasars 1419 + 543 and 1048 + 717 , which are , respectively , @xmath29 and @xmath30 away from the target , were observed after every 15 minutes of on - target integration for time - dependent complex gain calibrations .",
    "the averaged single - sideband system temperatures in the two tracks were 420 and 620  k.    the calibration and data inspection were performed with the caltech package mir modified for the sma .",
    "continuum data were generated by averaging the spectral channels after the passband calibration .",
    "both gain calibrators were used to derive gain curves .",
    "flux calibrations were performed using data taken under conditions ( time , hour angle , and elevation ) similar to that of the flux calibrator .",
    "the error in flux calibration is usually within 10% with this method .",
    "the calibrated visibility data were fourier transformed and deconvolved in the package miriad to form images . in the transformation we applied the `` robust weighting '' of briggs ( 1995 ) , with a robust parameter of + 0.9 to obtain a better balance between beam size and s / n .",
    "we also weighted each visibility point inversely proportional to the system temperature .",
    "the synthesized beam has a fwhm of @xmath31 at a position angle of @xmath32 .",
    "the theoretical noise and the noise measured in the clean deconvolved image are 0.94 and 1.05  mjy , respectively .",
    "hdf  850.1 is detected in both the dirty and cleaned images and is unresolved . in miriad",
    "a point - source fit to the image yields a flux of 7.8  mjy and a j2000 position of + ra 12@xmath0 36@xmath1 51.99@xmath2 ( @xmath33 ) + dec + 62@xmath3 12@xmath4 25.83@xmath5 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "+ here the positional errors were obtained using the imfit routine in miriad with a box size equal to 2.5 times the beam size . a more direct method of finding the position and error is to fit the visibilities .",
    "fitting with the uvfit routine in miriad gives a flux of @xmath35  mjy and a position of    ra 12@xmath0 36@xmath1 51.97@xmath2 ( @xmath36 ) + dec + 62@xmath3 12@xmath4 25.69@xmath5 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "+ the weighting of the flux extraction with uvfit may be less optimal than that with the imfit routine , so we adopt the imfit estimate of the flux and error . however , the error estimate in the imfit position is sensitive to the choice of box size , while the uvfit errors are not sensitive to such assumptions .",
    "we therefore adopt the uvfit position and positional errors .    in the images of the gain calibrators",
    "the measured positional offsets are all within the above errors .",
    "thus , we do not consider the calibration error to be a significant source of error in the astrometry .",
    "more specifically , we note that the observations of the two quasars were interleaved with each other and that we used the measured phase of each to derive the astrometry .",
    "they are not each self - calibrated , i.e. , placed at their vla position . combining the phases for both gives more accurate positions over a wider region of sky .",
    "we can make an estimate of the systematics by measuring the positional offsets of each quasar relative to their nominal positions , obtaining ( @xmath7,@xmath38 ) for 1419 + 545 and ( @xmath39,@xmath38 ) for 1048 + 717 .",
    "since hdf850.1 lies between the two quasars , the positional offset will , at some level , average these values .",
    "however , if we use the maximum values here as our estimate of the systematic error , our positional error becomes @xmath40 in ra and @xmath41 in dec .",
    "we will use this error estimate , which we believe to be quite conservative , in the subsequent discussion .",
    "the sma flux of hdf  850.1 is consistent with the earliest scuba jiggle - map measurement of hughes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who found a flux density of @xmath42  mjy , but it is larger than all of the later scuba results obtained with various mapping and source extraction methods ( serjeant et al .  2003 ; borys et al .  2003 ; wang et al .  2004 ) .",
    "it lies about @xmath43 from the scuba position of serjeant et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , which is reasonable given the expected positional error for a scuba source with this s / n ( e.g. , wang et al .",

    "we used the _ spitzer _ 24  @xmath12 m in - flight point - spread function ( psf ) to subtract the flux from the nearby radio source and then measured a @xmath51 aperture - corrected flux at the sma position of hdf  850.1 .",
    "the result is @xmath52  @xmath12jy .",
    "this is consistent with the value in pope et al .",
    "this may be considered as an upper limit , since the contamination from 3 - 856.0 is unclear and the resolution of _ spitzer _ does not allow a reliable separation between the two .",
    "we note that the level of contamination from 3 - 856.0 in the irac bands ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) is far too high to make any plausible flux estimates .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig1 ] , hdf  850.1 lies between two neighboring galaxies : a red elliptical galaxy ( 3 - 586.0 ) and a blue arc - like galaxy ( 3 - 593.1 ) .",

    "both of these sources have been suggested as counterparts to hdf  850.1 , but the present high - precision observations give separations that are clearly too large for this to be the case .",
    "similarly , the object hdf  850.1k , which dunlop et al .",
    "( 2004 ) claim to be the counterpart ( red circle in fig .",
