    "the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) is an important tool for studying the strongly correlated systems in low dimensions.@xcite in the past decade , one significant limitation of dmrg ",
    "finite basis requirement in the model which involves infinite degree of freedom , e.g. , phonon states , was circumvented by a controlled truncation technique.@xcite this technique is applied to many models , typically , such as 1d holstein model,@xcite 1d holstein - hubbard model,@xcite spin peierls model,@xcite and spin - boson model.@xcite the main idea of this technique , controlled truncation , is realized by the density matrix approach which is useful for finding the most probable states of the truncated system . by its light , the infinite hilbert space can be reduced to governable dimensions without significant loss of accuracy .",
    "however , the truncation technique is originally designed for the systems involving just one phonon mode , i.e. , the einstein model .",
    "the direct application of this technique to the spin - boson model with a continuous spectrum of phonon modes , is not very successful.@xcite for instance , in the case of ref .",
    ", the number of phonon modes were limited to @xmath0 , the physics of this highly discrete model may be unreliable .",
    "furthermore , the number of states of each phonon mode kept is @xmath1 , the truncation error is relatively large and no convincing result on the delocalized - localized transition was found.@xcite these limitation implies that , to handle the system with many phonon modes in a dmrg treatment , one needs to develop an improved truncation technique .",
    "this is the motivation of the present paper .    here",
    ", let us briefly introduce the spin - boson model .",
    "the spin - boson model is an important toy model in the study of dissipative quantum systems .",
    "its hamiltonian is given by ( set @xmath2)@xcite @xmath3 where the pauli matrices @xmath4 describe a two - state system , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are phonon creation and annihilation operators with frequencies @xmath7 for the @xmath8-th phonon modes , @xmath9 is an additional bias ( asymmetry ) , @xmath10 is the bare tunneling splitting , and @xmath11 represents the coupling between the two - state system and the @xmath8-th phonon mode . generally , the so - called bath spectral function @xmath12 completely determine the solutions of the spin - boson model . with an energy cutoff @xmath13 , i.e. , discards the high energy modes , the bath spectral function has a power - law form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a dimensionless coupling constant which characterizes the dissipation strength , @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent sub - ohmic , ohmic , and super - ohmic dissipation , respectively .",
    "the primary purpose of the spin - boson model is to study the effect of the environment on quantum tunneling of the two - state system . here",
    "the environment is modelled as a collection of harmonic oscillators , which serves as the origin of dissipation.@xcite intuitively , the presence of the environment will make the tunneling particle as a  dressed \" one , just like the electron in a polaron - phonon ( or exciton - phonon ) system , and therefore its quantum tunneling decreases as the coupling increases .",
    "one important issue in spin - boson model is to study the phonon - induced localization ( also stated as delocalized - localized transition ) , i.e. , how quantum tunneling dies out as the coupling ( or the dissipation ) increases.@xcite such a delocalized - localized transition at @xmath18 is now considered as some kind of quantum phase transition called boundary phase transition.@xcite in general , the hamiltonian of the spin - boson model can not be solved exactly , especially in the sub - ohmic case.@xcite the delocalized - localized transition has been widely studied by various methods with different approximations , yet a consensus on the delocalized - localized transition in sub - ohmic case is still lacking . by integrating out the bath degrees of freedom , the spin - boson model was mapped to an ising model and the localized transition was predicted to exist for @xmath19 ( i.e. , in both ohmic and sub - ohmic cases).@xcite however , the path - integration with the so - called noninteracting blip approximation ( niap ) and the adiabatic renormalization predicted that no delocalized - localized transition happens in the sub - ohmic case.@xcite on the other hand , in the sub - ohmic case , variational calculations , flow equation method , and other perturbation calculations predicted a discontinuous delocalized - localized transition,@xcite while the non - perturbative numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) calculation shows a continuous one.@xcite recently , the authors showed that the discontinuous transition in the sub - ohmic case obtained by the variational calculation is simply an artifact of the variational scheme due to the fact that the energy of the variational ground state can no longer be lower than the energy of the trial ground state ( displaced - oscillator state).@xcite while this result sheds some lights on the problem , the discrepancy between various treatments mentioned above has not yet been resolved .",
    "in addition , although the nrg approach is regarded as the most powerful tool for treating the phase transition , the error due to discretization in numeric calculation has to be considered.@xcite under this sense , the delocalized - localized transition is necessary to study by another non - perturbative method , i.e. , dmrg .",
    "we hope that this paper will be helpful for resolving the discrepancy .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the following section",
    ", we propose a finite system dmrg approach with controlled truncation technique to the spin - boson model , a thousand phonon modes can be treated . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we determine the dmrg parameters and discuss the very small energy scales limitation of our treatment .",
    "[ sec4 ] suggests a extrapolation scheme to circumvent the very small energy scales limitation .",
    "the delocalized - localized transition points of the spin - boson model , which is associated to the very small energy phonon modes , are obtained by extrapolation of  pseudo - critical \" points .",
    "conclusion is given in the last section .",
    "here we present a finite system dmrg algorithm with the optimized truncation of multi - modes phonon space to treat the spin - boson model whose bosonic bath involves several hundred phonon modes .",
    "the key strategy of the algorithm is that one represents a single phonon mode as a site .",
    "the spin - boson model therefore becomes a finite - size chain . in this case ,",
    "finite system dmrg is naturally applied to this model since it is appropriate to reduce the environment error with sweeping processes.@xcite to reach this , we must divide the frequency spectrum into @xmath20 intervals , i.e. , @xmath21 $ ] , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24=0 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "in other words , the frequency spectrum is divided linearly .",
    "the corresponding coupling parameters @xmath11 can be obtained by the spectral function ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) @xmath27 suppose that @xmath28 bare phonon states ( @xmath29 ) are sufficient to represent one phonon mode accurately , therefore we can limit @xmath28 bare phonon states in each phonon site . using the controlled reduction technique,@xcite the dimension of each phonon mode can be further reduced to @xmath30 where @xmath31 . however , even though @xmath1 is quite large for a dozen phonon modes , as in the treatment by nishiyama.@xcite in this case , the number of phonon modes that can be treated is seriously restricted .",
    "our solution to this problem is to truncate a set of phonon sites with the density matrix approach within each dmrg step , i.e. , we do not optimized phonon modes individually .",
    "the truncated multi - phonon sites can be continuously optimized by the sweeping of the finite system dmrg algorithm .",
    "similar treatment was done by friedman in the study of spin - peierls model.@xcite with these prerequisites , the finite system dmrg algorithm can be implemented in the following way .",
    "as the standard finite system dmrg algorithm which is used in heisenberg model,@xcite the first step of the algorithm is  warmup \" .",
    "we must generate a series of phonon blocks for the subsequent sweeping processes of the finite system dmrg algorithm . for simplicity",
    ", we assume the number of phonon modes is odd and generate the blocks @xmath32 and @xmath33 separately , where different numbers represent different phonon modes . with this simplification ,",
    "all the phonon blocks @xmath34 except for the blocks @xmath35 and @xmath20 which keep @xmath28 bare phonon states are limited to a @xmath36 matrix because only the two - state system have been traced out;@xcite see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "; see fig . [",
    "fig1](b ) .",
    "the right part phonon modes can be obtained by similar fashion .",
    "( b ) systematic illustration of the finite system dmrg algorithm .",
    "this figure shows one sweep in the algorithm.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] +    during the course of warmup , each phonon mode with @xmath28 bare phonon states is added to the preceding block . after a truncation with density matrix approach , one new block is generated .",
    "we shall show that @xmath37 is sufficient for the implementation of our algorithm in most cases .",
    "note that , every block generated within the warmup processes must be stored in memory for later use .",
    "secondly , the finite system dmrg algorithm is implemented as in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "the finite system dmrg algorithm is more or less the same as the standard algorithm.@xcite the main difference between the two algorithms is that we add one site within each dmrg step instead of two sites .",
    "it is because there are no interactions between the phonon blocks , the implementation of our algorithm is identical to the standard algorithm , and no further correction is needed.@xcite for convenience , the two - state system can be placed on leftmost side or rightmost side on the chain , as to calculate the reduced density matrix and apply the traditional wave function transformations technique to the finite system algorithm.@xcite within each dmrg step , a phonon mode with @xmath28 bare states is added .",
    "this new site is used to generate a new phonon block or optimize the old phonon block with @xmath38 optimized states .",
    "finally , the energies of the target states will converge after one or two sweeps are preformed .    in summary",
    ", the algorithm can be proceeded as follows :    1 .",
    "warmup , generating a series of phonon blocks for subsequent sweeping processes ; 2 .",
    "starting at the center phonon mode @xmath39 , adding one phonon mode with @xmath28 bare states to the chain ; 3 .   performing the sweeping process to the whole chain ; 4 .",
    "if the energies of the target states are not converged after a sweeping , then return to step ( 2 ) .",
    "one important issue of the algorithm is that how to choose the parameters @xmath40 , and the number of sweeps @xmath41 . unlike the spin @xmath42 heisenberg chain ,",
    "there are no interactions between the phonon blocks , the number of states kept per block is not quite large .",
    "therefore , it may be possible to treat a thousand phonon modes while the number of states kept per block is never needed more than @xmath43 . in general , there are only @xmath44 largest eigenvalues in the reduced density matrix of the phonon block have significant values .    , and @xmath41 for @xmath45 , and @xmath46 . ( a ) dependence on @xmath38 for fixed @xmath47 , and @xmath41 ; ( b ) dependence on @xmath28 for fixed @xmath48 , and @xmath41 ; ( c ) dependence on the number of phonon modes @xmath20 for fixed @xmath49 , and @xmath41 ; ( d ) dependence on @xmath41 , the number of sweeps versus the ground state energy , for fixed @xmath50 , and @xmath38.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] +    the dependence of the ground state energy on the parameters @xmath40 , and @xmath41 for @xmath51 , and @xmath46 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( targeting the ground state only , but the following conclusions are also true for targeting both the ground state and the first excited state ) .",
    "it is worth noting that even though @xmath52 , and @xmath53 can give rather the same results .",
    "however , the number of phonon modes @xmath20 will highly affect the results .",
    "this is also the main limitation of our dmrg strategy .    as indicated in refs .  , , and , the very small energy phonon modes are important for revealing the critical phenomena , e.g. , the delocalized - localized transition of the two - state system .",
    "however , the strategy of our algorithm needs linear discretization of the spectrum which can not resolve very small energy scale . if one tries to apply a logarithmic discretization which is used in nrg to the dmrg algorithm , the energy levels of the hamiltonian emerge a staircase - like aspect when one deals with the very small energy phonon modes ; see fig .",
    "the dmrg scheme fails in this situation because the target states can not be determined .",
    "this difficultly stems from the truncation strategy of the dmrg , say , it iteratively calculates the lowest eigenstates for finding the most probable states of the decimated system .",
    "however , in practice , it is harsh for the iterative diagonalization routines being used by drmg , such as lanczos and davidson , to converge when the staircase - like energy levels occur .     is the number of energy levels . the vertical coordinate ( energy )",
    "is scaled by @xmath20 and @xmath54 in dmrg and nrg , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ] +    in fact , the staircase - like energy levels also appear in nrg calculations .",
    "nevertheless , the truncation scheme of nrg , which retains the lowest - lying states directly , is simply to implement in this situation . in other words ,",
    "the performance of the standard diagonlization routine used by nrg will not be affected by the  shape \" of the spectrum while dmrg needs iterative diagonlization routine which converges arduously .",
    "dmrg can not resolve very small energy scales , this limitation is serious .",
    "it implies that the critical coupling @xmath55 can not be determined due to the energy levels can not reach to a fixed point without very small energy phonons@xcite and the spin - spin correlation function can not be calculated in very small energy scales .",
    "furthermore , the effective tunneling splitting @xmath56 also is not adequate to identify the critical coupling @xmath55 because it fails to characterize the tunneling in equilibrium in the sub - ohmic case.@xcite our dmrg calculations have the same conclusion , namely , @xmath57 when @xmath58 in the sub - ohmic case and @xmath59 when @xmath60 ( note that @xmath55 is a function of @xmath61 and @xmath10 ) in the ohmic case ( not presented ) .",
    "moreover , the entanglement entropy method proposed by ref . recently , which is used to determine the critical couplings and performs very well in nrg , is not working as expected in dmrg when the very small energy information is lacking .",
    "now , we seek to show that the critical couplings @xmath55 can be determined by extrapolating the pseudo - critical couplings @xmath62 which are extracted in a  dmrg flow \" to thermodynamic limit.@xcite similar to the energies in logarithmic discretization of nrg which are falling off as @xmath63,@xcite the energies are falling off as @xmath64 in linear discretization .",
    "therefore , one can target the ground state and the first excited state and scale the energy gap @xmath65 as @xmath66 and plot the flow diagram @xmath66 versus @xmath20 . as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the flows of @xmath66 are qualitatively different within two regime @xmath67 and @xmath58 .     on the number of phonon modes @xmath20 for @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath58 .",
    "parameters are @xmath69 , and @xmath70.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] +    therefore , we assume that there exist a function @xmath71 which separates the two regimes , where @xmath20 is relatively small in comparison with thermodynamic limit . in practice ,",
    "@xmath71 can be easily determined by a bisection process of two couplings @xmath72 and @xmath73 with the slope of a line segment consist of the scaled energies of two points @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "we conceive that the pseudo - critical coupling @xmath71 will converge to the critical coupling @xmath55 when @xmath75 since the fixed points are reached .",
    "accordingly , the extrapolation of the @xmath71 versus @xmath76 curve determines the critical coupling @xmath55 at the limit of @xmath77 .",
    "( circle ) and the best - fit values(line ) on the inverse number of phonon modes @xmath76 .",
    "parameters are @xmath69 , and @xmath70.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] +    figure [ fig5 ] shows the best - fit of the pseudo - critical couplings @xmath71 with @xmath78 . at @xmath79 , it turns out that @xmath80 . in fact , the best - fit curves @xmath81 are somewhat different for sub - ohmic and ohmic dissipation .",
    "it is related to the fact that the transition in the sub - ohmic case is characterized by a quantum critical fixed point in contrast to the ohmic case.@xcite since we can not find a formula to fit all the cases , the extrapolations are done by the simplest polynomial fitting .    admittedly , it might be doubted that if @xmath20 is small , @xmath62 could be inappropriate for extrapolation since it is inconsistent with the @xmath62 which are obtained with large @xmath20 .",
    "for instance , there are some cases show that the infinite system dmrg is a better choice to tackle this problem.@xcite however , on the one hand , our strategy of the dmrg in the spin - boson model limits the implementation of the algorithm . in order to  insert \" the spin - boson model into the dmrg algorithm , one must cut the spectrum of the bosonic bath to finite number of pieces and therefore the spin - boson model becomes a finite - size chain . before performing the linear discretization ,",
    "the number of sites @xmath20 and the coupling constant @xmath11 must be determined .",
    "naturally , it brings about the finite system dmrg algorithm to handle this model and a  real \" infinite dmrg algorithm is difficult to implement in practice . on the other hand , in our finite system dmrg solution ,",
    "the number of phonon modes treated is relatively large .",
    "we carefully check the calculations and find that when we calculate the @xmath62 with @xmath82 , the @xmath62 are always monotonic .",
    "hence , the extrapolations are safe and correct in our treatment .",
    "furthermore , references and also performed an extrapolation of the number of states kept , but the result shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and the fact of non - interacting phonon blocks guarantee that this quantity is not significant in our calculation notwithstanding .    using the extrapolation scheme ,",
    "the phase boundary for the delocalized - localized transition of the spin - boson model for @xmath83 and @xmath46 is shown in fig.[fig6 ] , where the result by nrg is also shown for comparison .",
    "it can be found that the dmrg data are consistent with the nrg data quite well .",
    "it also shows that the nrg data are always larger than the dmrg data .",
    "indeed , however , the results of nrg can be extrapolated to thermodynamics limit , namely , one takes the nrg discretization parameter @xmath84 , and smaller critical couplings can be obtained.@xcite in other words , both nrg and dmrg show that the critical couplings before extrapolating to thermodynamics limit are always larger than the true critical couplings .",
    "this implies that the error of discretization on determining the critical coupling is to lower the true @xmath55 , but not to heighten the @xmath55 as claimed in ref .. in addition , the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] also assures that our dmrg calculations for ohmic case are consistent with the nrg result@xcite and the well - known renormalization group result,@xcite i.e. , @xmath85 .",
    "at the end of this paper , we want to compare the ground state energy obtained by dmrg with the variational ground state energy obtained by displaced - oscillator approach . as we mentioned in the introduction",
    ", the variational ground state will fail at a certain point since the variational ground state is not yet stable.@xcite the comparison of the ground state energy is shown in fig .",
    "it shows that the dmrg ground state energies are always lower than that of the variational calculations .",
    "it is also clear that the dmrg ground state energy approaches to variational ground state energy for small @xmath15 and displaced - oscillator ground state energy for large @xmath15 , and no discontinuous effective tunneling splitting and ground state energy are observed by the dmrg calculations .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have proposed a finite system dmrg algorithm to deal with the spin - boson model .",
    "this algorithm is much more powerful than the preceding study of this topic because it can treat more than a thousand phonon modes.@xcite in fact , we have tried to calculate @xmath86 and @xmath87 phonon modes .",
    "unfortunately , our @xmath88-bit system is unable to tackle phonon modes on the @xmath87 magnitude due to out of memory .",
    "this difficultly , of course , can be resolved in @xmath89-bit system or storing the data in hard disk .",
    "moreover , we obtain the critical couplings @xmath55 by extrapolating the pseudo - critical couplings to thermodynamic limit .",
