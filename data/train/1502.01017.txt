    "giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) are the sites of star formation in galaxies .",
    "the existing correlation between molecular gas surface density and star formation rate @xcite implies that the formation and evolution of gmcs are essential to understand the build - up of stellar masses in galaxies .",
    "however , up - to - date studies of extragalactic gmc populations are limited to local group galaxies ; lmc @xcite , smc @xcite , m31 @xcite , m33 @xcite , and ic10 @xcite , the nearby spirals ; m64 @xcite and m51 @xcite , and the nearby starburst ; m82 @xcite and ngc253 @xcite , due to the limited angular resolution and sensitivity of radio telescopes .",
    "galaxies in the local group are mostly dwarfs with few spirals . therefore , additional study of gmcs in the early - type galaxies , such as ngc4526 , is needed to provide a comprehensive analysis of gmc properties across different galaxy environments .",
    "there are three resolved gmc properties that we can directly measure : size , linewidth , and luminosity .",
    "the relationships between these properties were first studied by @xcite , who suggested the importance of turbulence in the stability of gmcs against self - gravity .",
    "these relations were then refined by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s87 ) for gmcs in the milky way disk .",
    "basically , gmc properties in the milky way can be described by three larson s  laws  : ( 1 ) gmcs are gravitationally bound objects , ( 2 ) the size and velocity dispersion of gmcs follows a @xmath11 relation , and by implication ( 3 ) the surface density of gmcs is approximately constant ( @xmath12 , s87 ) .",
    "interestingly , these relations also hold true , albeit with scatter , for extragalactic gmcs in local group galaxies @xcite . at face value",
    ", this suggests that gmc properties are universal .",
    "however , further studies reveal that gmc properties can deviate from larson s relations .",
    "@xcite found that low mass gmcs ( @xmath13 ) in the outer part of the milky way are not gravitationally bound .",
    "their luminous masses , inferred from the co - to - h@xmath14 conversion factor , are smaller than their virial masses .",
    "the required external pressure to bind these clouds is @xmath15 k @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , when re - examining s87 clouds using more sensitive instruments , @xcite found that the surface density of milky way disk gmcs varies from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , and they deviate from gravitational equilibrium .",
    "@xcite suggest that these clouds may be in pressure virial equilibrium , where the clouds mass and radius are described by a bonnor - ebert sphere with various external pressures @xcite .",
    "in addition , several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) argue that the observed constancy of surface density might be affected by observational biases .",
    "if this is really the case , then what factors set the different properties of gmcs ?",
    "these parameters may be external ( environmental ) effects , such as hydrostatic pressure @xcite , interstellar radiation field strength @xcite , and shear from galaxy rotation @xcite , or internal , such as feedback of the star formation that is embedded inside gmcs @xcite . to answer this question , we need a complete sample of gmcs across different environments : from bulge to spiral - arm and inter - arm regions , from late - type to early - type galaxies , and from low to high metallicity galaxies .    in this respect ,",
    "we analyze the gmc properties in the bulge of ngc4526 , an s0-type galaxy in the virgo cluster .",
    "ngc4526 is unusual because all of the co in the galaxy has been observed at a linear resolution of @xmath0 pc , sufficient to resolve milky way sized gmcs .",
    "the galaxy has prominent central dust lanes with mass @xmath19 @xcite and supersolar metallicity ( log@xmath20 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but lack of star formation ( sfr @xmath21 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and devoid of atomic gas ( @xmath22 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the hi deficiency in this galaxy may be caused by ram pressure or evaporation by hot gas ( as the galaxy resides in the virgo cluster ) , or by abrupt conversion of hi into molecular gas due to high pressure @xcite .",
    "there is no indication of recent tidal interaction @xcite , suggesting that this mechanism is not the primary cause of hi deficiency in ngc4526 .",
    "in fact , the molecular gas in ngc4526 is confined within the central @xmath23 kpc region ( the top panel of figure 1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the central regions of galaxies , such as in the milky way , tend to have high interstellar pressures ( @xmath24 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , strong magnetic fields ( @xmath23 mg ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and lower than expected star formation rate @xcite .",
    "these properties offer a unique environment for gmcs in ngc4526 , significantly different than those studied in other galaxies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "in @xmath25 we describe the data and methodology to identify gmcs in ngc4526 . the properties and kinematics of the gmcs",
    "are reported in @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , and catalogued in table 1 .",
    "we discuss the pressure balance of gmcs in @xmath28 , the larson s  laws  in @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the environmental effects to the gmc properties in @xmath31 .",
    "lastly , we summarize our findings in @xmath32 .",
    "[ fig:1 ]    ngc4526 was observed in the @xmath1co(@xmath2 ) line ( 230 ghz or 1.3 mm ) using the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) in a , b , and c configurations @xcite .",
    "the data were taken as part of the mm - wave interferometric survey of dark object masses ( wisdom ) project .",
    "results for the innermost co were reported by @xcite , who showed that the kinematics of the central co imply the presence of a @xmath33 supermassive black hole .",
    "the beam width of the observations is @xmath34 arcsec@xmath35 and the spectral resolution ( after hanning smoothing ) is 10 km s@xmath36 .",
    "this beam width covers @xmath37 pixels and corresponds to a projected physical size of @xmath38 pc@xmath35 at the adopted distance of 16.4 mpc @xcite .",
    "these high resolution data enable us to resolve individual gmcs and measure their properties , since the typical milky way s gmc sizes are @xmath39 pc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the noise in our data is not uniform , with higher noise appearing at the corners of the data cube .",
    "the overall pixel - by - pixel root - mean - square ( rms ) noise @xmath40 distribution is a positively - skewed gaussian with minimum , average , and maximum values of 0.33 , 0.71 , and 1.33 k , respectively .",
    "we identify gmc candidates in ngc4526 using the modified clumpfind algorithm @xcite , implemented in the cprops program ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter rl06 ) .",
    "the main goal of this program is to identify all real clouds and minimize false detections due to noise fluctuations",
    ". descriptions of the cprops program , together with our chosen values of the input parameters of the program , are given in appendix a and b.    as a result of the cprops analysis , 241 gmcs are identified in ngc4526 , of which 103 are resolved .",
    "we assume all gmcs are real since the probability of false detections is very small ( appendix c ) . in the bottom panel of figure 1 ,",
    "we show the integrated co emission of connected regions that have brightness temperatures @xmath41 and have at least one pixel with @xmath42 . the locations of resolved and unresolved clouds are marked as blue and red ellipses , respectively .",
    "the peak s / n distribution of identified gmcs is shown as an inset .",
    "the mean peak s / n of resolved and unresolved clouds is 5.6 and 4.7 , respectively .",
    "most gmcs are located in the molecular ring , a few hundred parsecs from the galactic center ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this molecular ring is the largest contiguous co emission in our data .",
    "in addition , there are a few clouds located in the central region .",
    "the outer region of the molecular gas exhibits a spiral - arm structure , possibly with an outer pseudo - ring , which fragments into smaller structures consisting of one or multiple gmcs . except for one cloud that is described below",
    ", all identified gmcs are within 900 pc of the galactic center , i.e. inside the bulge of ngc4526 .",
    "note that our primary beam covers all of the co emission in the galaxy , so our gmc catalog is complete .",
    "there is one unresolved cloud which is located on the edge of the data cube ( not shown in figure 1 ) , out of the plane of the co emission .",
    "we overplotted the location of this cloud with the hst archival image of the galaxy .",
    "although this cloud is likely to be real ( appendix c ) , its distance is uncertain , i.e. it may be located outside the galaxy .",
    "we exclude this cloud from the following analysis but keep it in the catalog ( as cloud no . 80 in table 1 ) .",
    "inclusion of this cloud does not alter the conclusions of our analysis .",
    "cloud properties , such as position , size , velocity dispersion , luminosity , and mass , are catalogued in table 1 . here , we briefly describe the method used to measure the cloud properties .",
    "full explanations of the method are given in rl06 .",

    "the contours in figure 16 enclose to the 68% confidence level of the pdfs .",
    "we also fit the pdfs with a 2d - gaussian and show the gaussian centers as filled circles in figure 16 . the center and dispersion of the gaussians",
    "are tabulated in table 4 . for clarity",
    ", we do not show the data points .",
    "in addition , we check whether the pdfs in a given panel of figure 16 are sampled from the same parent distribution or not .",
    "this is tested with the two - dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) probability value ( table 5 ) .",
    "the higher the probability the more likely the pdfs are drawn from the same parent distribution .    for the first column in figure 16",
    ", we see that higher decomposition parameters ( e.g. @xmath50 , green contours ) yield larger scatters than lower decomposition parameters ( red and blue contours ) .",
    "the number of clouds for higher decomposition parameters is less than for lower decomposition parameters , so this larger scatter is not due to a larger number of data points .",
    "the larger scatter is probably due to the tendency of the program to combine small , neighboring clouds into bigger , merged clouds in the molecular ring island , while leaving the outer small islands as small clouds ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this tendency can be seen in figure 16 , as the pdfs of higher decomposition parameters extend to larger radii and higher luminosities .",
    "the gaussian centers of higher decomposition parameter also have larger radii and higher luminosities than those of lower decomposition parameters . in any case",
    ", none of those distributions shows a size - linewidth relation ( @xmath51 ) , and they have different normalization factors than larson s relations .    for the second column in figure 16 , the parameters ( edge , threshold ) = ( @xmath52 )",
    "almost have the same pdf as ( edge , threshold ) = ( @xmath53 ) . the ks - test yields a probability value of @xmath23 .",
    "this is because we only lose a few clouds with peak s / n @xmath54 .",
    "however , for parameters ( edge , threshold ) = ( @xmath55 ) , we lose many clouds because the islands only extend to connected pixels with @xmath56 ( i.e. the islands get smaller ) , and hence the spread of the pdf decreases due to a smaller number of data points . none of the distributions shows a size - linewidth relation , and they have different normalization factors than larson s relations .    for the third column in figure 16 , there is no distribution that yields the size - linewidth relation found in the milky way . in the linewidth vs luminosity plot ,",
    "the non - deconvolved distributions ( red and green contours ) yield larger velocity dispersions , as expected from equation ( 2 ) by excluding the @xmath57 term , and the extrapolated distribution ( red contour ) yields higher luminosities .",
    "all distributions in the linewidth vs. luminosity plot lie below larson s relation . in the size vs luminosity plot , the non - deconvolved distribution ( red contour ) yields a larger size , as expected from equation ( 1 ) by excluding the @xmath58 terms .",
    "all distributions in the size vs. luminosity plot lie above larson s relation .",
    "overall , we conclude that there is no significant effect on our general results due to the choice of input parameters and measurement methods .",
