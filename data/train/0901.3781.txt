    "early - type galaxies ( etgs ) are the most massive stellar systems in the universe , containing much of the cosmic budget of visible and dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "they include elliptical ( e ) and lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies and form a nearly uniform class of objects : usually red , old and with only traces of cold gas and active star formation .",
    "the striking regularities in their properties include strong correlations between size ( e.g. the effective radius , ) and the surface brightness therein (;",
    "@xcite ) , and between kinematics ( the central velocity dispersion @xmath3 ) and luminosity ( @xmath4 ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter fj ) ) .",
    "the two relations above merge into the so - called fundamental plane ( fp ; @xcite ) , i.e. a relation between the ( logarithm of ) ,  and  of etgs .",
    "the fp can be interpreted in terms of the virial theorem of relaxed systems , according to which @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the potential energy and @xmath7 the kinetic energy .",
    "this can be re - written in terms of observed quantities as approximately @xmath8 .",
    "however , the fp is found observationally to be @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 , i.e. a different orientation of the plane in the space of the logarithmic quantities with respect to the virial prediction .",
    "this _ tilt _ of the fp provides insight for the formation and structure of etgs , and can be interpreted as a variation of the total mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath12 ) with @xmath4 ( @xcite ) with the simplest parameterization as a power law , @xmath0 .",
    "the slope , @xmath1 , of this relation could be driven by one or more different factors : a variation in stellar @xmath12 ( due to metallicity or age gradient or change in imf ) , a variation in the dm content , non - homology , rotational support , etc .",
    "( see e.g. ) .",
    "it is of considerable importance to disentangle these factors using high - quality data at low redshift , in order to use the fp as a guide to galaxy evolution in different environments and cosmic epochs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "many studies over the years have attempted to decode the fp tilt ( e.g. @xcite ; ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ps96 ) ; ) .",
    "the emerging consensus is that stellar populations account for a minor fraction of the tilt ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter t+04 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter c+06 ) ; @xcite ; see however @xcite ) , with the major contributor yet to be firmly identified  which would have ramifications for galaxy formation models ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an additional complication is that the tilted fp may not be flat , with claims made for curvature @xcite , and projections of the fp showing a bend at a characteristic magnitude of @xmath2 ( see section  [ sec : sample ] ) .",
    "this transition concords with more general findings of a discontinuity in etg properties at a similar luminosity ( e.g. @xcite ) .    of particular interest",
    "is the fp contribution from the central dm content , since connecting luminous galaxies to their dm haloes is one of the key ingredients in modern recipes for galaxy assembly .",
    "the dm component of the fp tilt is currently a bone of contention , with findings alternatively of negligible impact ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g+01 ) ; t+04 ) , and of primary importance ( @xcite ; c+06 ) .",
    "more generally , several lines of evidence point to a small but significant fraction of dm ( @xmath13 ) inside 1   ( e.g. g+01 ; @xcite ) , but the galaxies probed are typically very bright es with @xmath14  .",
    "as data have become available on more `` ordinary '' etgs , there are suggestions that their dm properties vary strongly with luminosity , with perhaps even a dichotomy following the classic division of faint , discy , fast - rotating galaxies and bright , boxy , slow - rotators ( @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter n+05 ) ; @xcite ; c+06 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to reexamine all the plausible factors that could contribute to the fp tilt",
    ". we will not be directly studying the fp , but rather will survey systematic trends in the central properties of etgs which factor into the apparent @xmath12 variation , @xmath1 .",
    "our study springs from the classic data - set of central photometry and kinematics of ps96 , which is one of the largest such catalogues of local galaxies covering a wide range of luminosities .",
    "our analysis consists of two parts , wherein we independently determine the stellar component of the @xmath12 by stellar populations models , and the total @xmath12 by dynamical models .",
    "we take particular care in considering realistic star formation histories , stellar populations modelling systematics , and dynamical contributions from dm .",
    "we briefly describe the galaxy sample in section  [ sec : sample ] and analyze the stellar populations in section  [ sec : mtol_star ] .",
    "we determine the dynamical masses in section  [ sec : dynm ] and infer the dm fractions in section  [ sec : dm ] .",
    "section  [ sec : av_dm ] considers some implications for galaxy formation , and section  [ sec : conclusions ] draws conclusions and considers future prospects .",
    "our data - set of local etgs is drawn from ps96 .",
    "this is currently one of the largest homogeneous samples of local etgs available in the literature containing both photometry and kinematics of the galaxy central regions , and the only one including information on the peak rotation velocity ( ) .",
    "as discussed in ps96 , the colours ( extinction- and k - corrected ) are measured within 1  , the central velocity dispersions  are recovered from long slit spectra and  is defined as the quadratic sum of the maximum rotation on the major and minor axes . since we are interested in fitting spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , we select galaxies with at least two measured colours ( most of the selected galaxies have four colours ) , while the differences of @xmath15 and @xmath16 colours with those in rc3 are @xmath17 and @xmath18 . ] . selecting also for galaxies brighter than @xmath19",

    "e galaxies populate a restricted region in the colour - magnitude diagram , the so - called `` red sequence '' , with a colour range of @xmath35 .",

    "one of the key aspects of our analysis is determining each sample galaxy s stellar @xmath12 , , which we do by fitting model seds to the observed galaxy colours .",
    "although photometric modelling may seem less powerful than detailed spectroscopic fits , most spectroscopic samples are restricted to the very central regions of galaxies and may be very biassed indicators of the stellar populations on scales of @xmath43 .    in section  [ sec : stellarmodels ]",

    "we report the implications for the size - mass relation in section  [ sec : size_relations ] , and for trends in  in section  [ sec : stellarml ] .",
    "we create a set of synthetic stellar spectra using the prescription of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bc03 ) , which encompasses a wide range of initial metallicities and ages .",
    "a @xcite or @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) is assumed , with initial masses @xmath44 in the range @xmath45 .",
    "the two imfs do not influence the colours , but basically affect the  estimates , which are @xmath46 times larger with a salpeter imf than with a chabrier imf .    to generate a more general and realistic star formation history ( sfh ) , we convolve the bc03 `` single burst '' models with an exponentially - decaying star formation ( sf ) rate with time @xmath47 , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a characteristic time scale .",

    "our synthetic modelling procedure is more general than the extensively used `` simple stellar population '' ( ssp ) model where a galaxy is approximated as experiencing a single burst of star formation ( i.e. @xmath60 ; @xcite ; see also appendix  [ sec : appa ] ) . instead we leave , @xmath49 and @xmath52 all as free parameters in order to better represent the wide variety of sfh expected both observationally and theoretically ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the allowed ranges in the parameters will then be larger than in the more simplified ssp case because of the well known degeneracies among them ( @xcite ; bc03 ) .    to test the reliability of our modelling technique and the intrinsic parameter scatter , and to check for the presence of spuriously - generated correlations , we run a suite of monte carlo simulations .",
    "we extract 100 simulated galaxy spectra from our bc03 sed libraries with random , @xmath52 and @xmath49 ( i.e. with no correlation among these parameters ) , and apply our generalized fit procedure  comparing the recovered parameters with the input model values .",

    "we check for spurious correlations using a spearman rank test ( @xcite ) , finding that @xmath49 vs  show no correlation at the @xmath64 confidence level , but that  and @xmath52 are weakly correlated , which is a common effect in stellar populations analyses , however , this -@xmath52 degeneracy does not affect the  inference , which is our primary concern .    after fitting the real data for the complete sample of 335 galaxies , we show some relations between model parameters and other observed galaxy quantities in fig .  [",
    "fig : various_stellar_correlations ] . from this figure",
    "it is evident that the metallicity is generally solar or super - solar ( @xmath65 ) and on average only weakly dependent on other properties such as luminosity  which is fortunate since the bc03 stellar libraries include only a few reference values for @xmath52 .",
    "more striking are the strong correlations involving  and @xmath49 , such that the brighter , more massive galaxies formed their stars on average on shorter timescales than the fainter , less massive galaxies , while the younger galaxies also had shorter sf timescales ( this does _ not _ mean that the brighter galaxies are younger , and if the s0s are included , the opposite is clearly true ) .",
    "+   +    similar findings on the sfhs of etgs have been found in observational ( e.g. @xcite ) and theoretical ( e.g. @xcite ) analyses .",
    "we will consider this subject in detail in a subsequent paper ( @xcite , in prep . ) , and for now summarize some basic parameters .",
    "the bright etgs ( @xmath66 ) have a median @xmath67  gyr , while the faint etgs have @xmath68  gyr .",
    "the es have similar properties , while the s0s have on average more protracted sfhs ( @xmath6911.5  gyr ) .",
    "the median  for the etgs is @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) for a salpeter ( chabrier ) imf , where the quoted errors are the 1  @xmath72 scatter .",
    "the s0s have only slightly smaller median  than the es : @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) and @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) , respectively .",
    "however , the two samples differ more strongly in the _ distribution _ of , where the es have a fairly symmetric distribution about the mean , while the s0s have a pronounced tail to low  such that the mean value of @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) differs from the median estimate .",
    "an indirect way to test our derived  values is to check how the implied scaling relation between size and stellar mass compares to previously established results . expressing the size-_luminosity _ relation as @xmath79",
    ", we find a slope for the es of @xmath80 , which is slightly steeper than some literature findings of @xmath81 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , this slope is very sensitive to the range of luminosities fitted , since we see a difference between the `` faint '' and `` bright '' subsamples ( see section  [ sec : sample ] and right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : sample ] ) .    for the size-_mass _ relation @xmath82",
    ", we obtain @xmath83 overall ( fig .",
    "[ fig : reff_vs_lb_and_mstar ] ) , consistent with previous estimates for low - redshift galaxies of typically @xmath84 ( @xcite ; n+05 ) .",
    "this correlation also bends at a characteristic mass scale of @xmath85 , with @xmath86 and @xmath87 for the faint and bright galaxies , respectively ( cf . @xcite ) .",
    "we find the s0s to have on average smaller @xmath88 than es of the same mass , and similar @xmath89 at high masses , but flattening to @xmath90 at low masses .",
    "the central regions of etgs are probably dominated by the stellar mass , so it is of critical importance to ascertain the fraction of the fp tilt that is connected to the stellar population properties .",
    "we focus on the relation @xmath91 in log - log space , fitting to weighted medians of binned data values , with results that are stable to changes in the binning ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ups_star_vs_lb_zsol_tau_1gyr ] ) . for the overall etg sample ,",
    "we find a slope of @xmath92 ; the es have @xmath93 , and s0s have @xmath94 , although this steeper slope is driven by the very faintest galaxies ( @xmath95 ) .    before taking these results at face value ,",
    "we investigate possible dependencies on modelling systematics . changing",
    "the imf from salpeter to chabrier does not affect @xmath96 , but only the overall normalization of . adopting a simplified model with  as the only free parameter , with @xmath97  gyr and @xmath98 fixed to the median values for the whole sample",

    "thus , we see that allowing for the variations of sf timescales ( and metallicity ) within the sample is critical to accurately deriving the  trends with luminosity . an additional complication , only partially addressed by our model s protracted exponential sfh , is multiple bursts of sf in a single galaxy which , if corrected for , would probably flatten the slope even further ( cf . section  4.7 of c+06 ) .",
    "we next consider alternative stellar populations basis models .",
    "as detailed in appendix  [ sec : appa ] , adopting the bj01 or m05 models with the same assumptions would imply shallower and steeper  slopes , respectively .",
    "this turns out to be the dominant source of uncertainty in the analysis , although the uncertainty is largest for the faintest galaxies ( @xmath101 ) , and the  estimates more stable for the brighter galaxies . ] .",
    "how do our results compare to previous work ? as mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] , most recent studies agree that @xmath96 is a relatively small contributor to the total @xmath1 of the fp .",
    "e.g. ps96 inferred from the same data set that @xmath102 , and t+04 found using very different data and techniques that @xmath103 in the @xmath54-band to the magnitude .",
    "t+04 applied the pegase prescription @xcite to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) early data release .",
    "t+04 also found @xmath104 in the @xmath105-band using 2mass data @xcite , but one would expect @xmath96 to depend on bandpass because of the changing contributions from the mix of stellar populations . ] .",
    "this general consistency is encouraging , but it should be kept in mind that as just discussed , there remain significant uncertainties in the modelling .",
    "the foregoing conclusions are based upon a universal imf , but there are suspicions that the imf may vary with time or environment ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite pointed out that a variation in the imf with luminosity could easily account for the fp tilt .",
    "here we illustrate this point again with a simple toy model , wherein the faint galaxies have a chabrier imf , and the bright ones a salpeter imf ( a more realistic scenario would have the imf changing smoothly with luminosity )",
    ". the implied  slope would be @xmath106 ( fig . [",
    "fig : ups_star_vs_lb_zsol_tau_1gyr_imfchange ] ) , which as we will see would be enough to explain the fp tilt with no further ingredients ( e.g. no dm ) .",
    "we lastly examine the correlation of  with velocity dispersion : @xmath107 .",
    "the fitted slope is @xmath108 for both es and s0s ( fig . [ fig : mtolstar_vs_sig0 ] ) .",
    "the steepness of this trend relative to @xmath96 suggests that the stellar populations of galaxies are more strongly linked to their dynamical masses than to their luminosities .",
    "this issue will be considered in more detail in the following sections , and as part of a separate analysis in @xcite .",
    "besides , the other fundamental quantity we want to determine is the total dynamical @xmath12 , . the usual way the dynamical mass is calculated in fp studies is with the virial relation @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the gravitational constant and @xmath105 is a pressure correction coefficient ( or virial coefficient ; e.g. @xcite ; c+06 ) .",
    "the @xmath105 factor subsumes a host of issues such as the aperture wherein @xmath3 is measured , and variations or `` non - homologies '' in the viewing angles , orbital structures , luminosity profile , dm distribution , etc .    rather than adopting some approximate value or function for @xmath105 , we will here directly model the non - homologies as much as possible for every individual galaxy in the sample , using the jeans equations to estimate  within 1  .",
    "we outline the modelling methods in section  [ sec : dynmeth ] , present results based on luminosity profile homology in section  [ sec : hom ] and on more general profiles in section  [ sec : nonhom ] .",
    "the basic approach of our dynamical models is to take the observed luminosity profile for each galaxy , along with a parameterized mass model , and solve for the projected velocity dispersion @xmath3 within a central aperture .",
    "the mass model parameters are then optimized to match the observed value for @xmath3 .",
    "in detail , the steps are the following :    1 .",
    "we parameterize the luminosity profile @xmath111 by either a ( deprojected ) @xcite profile or a more general @xcite model @xcite  which fully takes into account any non - homologies in the stellar density distributions .",
    "the functional form for @xmath111 is specified in appendix  b of ps97 .",
    "we adopt a simplified form for the total cumulative dynamical mass profile @xmath112 which is either a constant-@xmath12 profile @xmath113 ( including the cases where dm is missing or has a cored distribution ; see @xcite ) , or a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) , where @xmath114 .",
    "the latter choice is motivated by evidence from strong gravitational lensing for near - sis profiles in the central regions of etgs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these two alternatives bracket the plausible range of mass profiles .",
    "we solve the jeans equation : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the anisotropy .",
    "this model assumes spherical symmetry and no rotation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . for simplicity",
    "we also assume isotropy ( @xmath117 ) , in which case the jeans eq .  ( [ eq : jeans ] ) can be transformed to : @xmath118 4 .",
    "we project eq .",
    "( [ eq : iso ] ) to obtain the line - of - sight velocity dispersion : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the projected density profile .",
    "we integrate @xmath121 within a fixed aperture @xmath122 to obtain the aperture velocity dispersion , @xmath123 using the equation : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the luminosity within the projected radius @xmath126 and @xmath127 , the median  values are overestimated by @xmath128 and @xmath129 , well within the typical uncertainty on each estimate and on the sample s global scatter . ] .",
    "we fit the model @xmath123 to the observed @xmath3 and iterate the preceding steps , varying the free parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : iso ] )   ( i.e. @xmath130 or @xmath131 ) .",
    "the resulting best - fit mass profile then provides the total spherical mass - to - light ratio within an effective radius ( ) ( which is coincident with @xmath131 in the case of the constant - model ) .",
    "this procedure does not take into account certain factors that could in principle alter the final mass estimates .",
    "firstly , the mass model does not include a central black hole , but we calculate the effect to be negligible in the jeans equations , using @xmath132 predicted by the correlation @xmath133 in @xcite .",
    "the result was to decrease  by @xmath134 . ] .",
    "more importantly , real galaxies are neither spherical nor isotropic in general .",
    "we will check the impact of these simplifications later , but here begin with a first - order correction to the isotropic results .",
    "detailed dynamical models of nearby galaxies have shown that their central stellar parts are close to isotropic _ after subtracting the rotational component _ ( e.g. g+01 ; c+06 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the observed @xmath123 does incorporate both the projected rotation and dispersion components of the specific kinetic energy ( @xmath135 ) , and the jeans equations could in principle be reformulated along these lines .",
    "however , for many galaxies the rotation is so dominant that it is preferable to include it as an additional , separate term , which would require additional assumptions about the rotation field of each galaxy , and would best entail a non - spherical treatment anyway  all of which is beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "here we adopt a heuristic correction to the _ observed _ dispersion in order to approximately account for rotational effects .",
    "following ps94 , we parameterize the corrected @xmath136 by @xmath137 . to estimate  we have performed monte carlo simulations as in @xcite , beginning with a suite of analytical spherical stellar+dm models as described in n+05 .",
    "for each model with a fixed gravitational potential , we assume isotropy and an additional rotational component that increases with radius , then solve the jeans equations and project to @xmath123 .",
    "finally we examine the factor  that relates the rotating and non - rotating `` measurements '' @xmath123 , finding this simple approximation : @xmath138 which is calculated for an aperture of 1   and turns out to be valid for a large range of galaxy masses .",
    "we therefore apply this correction to the observed @xmath123 before matching to the models in step ( vi ) above .",
    "the correction increases the inferred  values since rotation at @xmath43 coupled with the @xmath117 assumption depresses the central @xmath139 for a given mass profile : a rotational component must be subtracted from the right hand side of eq .",

    "the consistencies of the trends for the etg sub - types ( s0s , fast - rotator es , slow - rotator es ) suggest that the dominant driver of star formation is mass , not angular momentum .",
    "it is of course a stretch to draw firm conclusions about virial quantities based on data from scales @xmath198 .",
    "the central dm content that we are actually probing may be decoupled from the overall dm content in several ways : the central dm density reflects the ambient density at the time of initial halo collapse ; the baryons could have interacted with the dm and changed its distribution ; and the  quantity that we measure is somewhat dependent on the particular values of  for the stars rather than simply probing the dm properties . to allow for such effects , and to provide quantitative marks for comparison to cosmological theory , we now consider the properties of the dm alone , in terms of its average density within some small radius , .    in order to make critical comparisons with a literature study discussed below , we estimate  within 2  , extrapolating our usual models outwards in radius .",

    "here we examine the role of systematic uncertainties in the stellar populations results , using different assumptions and basis models ( see , also , similar analysis in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "the impact of these differences is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : distr_upsilon_2 ] ( left panel ) , where it can be seen that overly restrictive modelling assumptions compensate with large variations in  and thus steeper values for @xmath96 .",
    "+    next we compare basis model variations , starting with bc03 and m05 .",
    "the different input stellar models and treatments of the thermally - pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase ( tp - agb ) lead to different  predictions for the same colours @xcite  @xmath232 .",
    "these new models are more similar to m05 than bc03 but for old ages resemble bc03 @xcite . ] .",
    "comparisons of some parameters derived from the two models with solar metallicity , given the same colour data , are made in fig .",
    "[ fig : distr_upsilon_2 ] ( right panels ) .",
    "the inferred ages agree very well for older populations , with m05 returning ages up to @xmath233  10% higher than bc03 , while for younger populations , up to @xmath233  30% lower .",
    "the difference stems from m05 predicting @xmath50 and @xmath51 to be redder for young populations and bluer for old , while @xmath15 is redder for all ages .",
    "the implications for  are that agreement is good for @xmath234  , while for lower values the m05 predictions are smaller by up to a factor of two .",

    "we also compare our _ modelled _ values of @xmath246 ( the velocity dispersion integrated over a 1  aperture , folding in the rotational contribution ) with their _ observed _ values , to see if our extrapolation from the central aperture could be generating the discrepancy . however , our @xmath246 values turn out to be _ lower _ by @xmath247 , which goes the wrong way to explain our _ higher _ masses .",
    "next we consider the detailed spherical dynamical models of g+01 , with 16 galaxies in common . after shifting to the same distance scale ,",
    "our  values at  are @xmath248 _ lower _ on average than theirs .",
