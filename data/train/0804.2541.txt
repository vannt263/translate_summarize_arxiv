    "the wigner function @xcite has long been recognized as a tool in quantum mechanics . for a wave function @xmath0 on the real line it is defined as @xmath1 it is a function on phase space that comes , in a certain sense , as close to being a classical probability distribution corresponding to @xmath2 on phase space as possible .",
    "it can therefore be used to analyze the extent to which a given quantum state can be described in classical terms .",
    "furthermore the wigner function figures prominently in weyl quantization , a map that assigns symmetric operators to real functions ( subject to smoothness and fall - off criteria ) on phase space in a systematic fashion . in physics parlance ,",
    "weyl quantization is referred to as _ totally symmetric ordering_. a comprehensive mathematical treatment of the wigner function and its properties in quantum mechanics can be found in @xcite .",
    "loop quantum cosmology ( lqc for short , see @xcite for a review ) is a theory of quantum cosmology developed in close connection with loop quantum gravity @xcite , and can be viewed as a symmetry reduced version of the latter .",
    "it has been used as a testbed for techniques used in loop quantum gravity , but it can be argued that it also makes physical predictions in its own right .",
    "one large set of results shows that the classical singularities of cosmology are resolved in the quantum theory . as an example",
    ", we refer to @xcite for a beautiful result in this direction .",
    "technically lqc started out as a quantum theory on a circle , but it was later realized that it is actually more appropriately formulated as a quantum theory on the bohr compactification @xmath3 of the real line . while we will review some of the mathematics of @xmath3 and of the functions on this space in section [ se_rbohr ] below , we refer to @xcite for a good overview over both mathematical and physical aspects of these developments .    given that quantum mechanics on @xmath3 is the foundation for lqc , it is an interesting question whether the wigner function can be generalized to this setting .",
    "a look at the literature shows that the wigner function can be , and has been , generalized in a number of ways , for example to quantum mechanics on u(1 ) , and more generally , certain non - abelian groups ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the wigner function for u(1 ) has made a brief appearance in lqg @xcite , where it was used in the study of the semiclassical limit . in these generalizations ,",
    "the role of fourier analysis is played by its natural generalizations for harmonic analysis on groups ( pontryagin duality in the abelian case , peter - weyl theory for compact non - abelian groups ) .",
    "it must however be said that such generalizations are generically neither unique , nor do they share all the properties of the wigner function on @xmath4 .    to the best of our knowledge",
    "however , a generalization of the wigner function to @xmath3 has not yet been considered .",
    "the present paper intends to fill this gap .",
    "as it turns out , the generalization of the wigner function to @xmath3 is quite straightforward .",
    "what is more , its properties mirror that of its cousin on @xmath4 extremely closely .",
    "this is due on the one hand to the abelian nature of @xmath3 , on the other hand to a useful property of the pontryagin dual of @xmath3 , namely that the operation of  taking a square root \" with respect to its group product is well defined . such square roots ( or divisions by two , in additive notation )",
    "will naturally show up when proving properties of the wigner function .",
    "we will also demonstrate the applicability of the wigner function to issues in lqc .",
    "in particular we will use it to obtain the weyl quantization of the modified holonomy from @xcite , which in turn could be used to define a modified quantum dynamics .",
    "we will compare the properties of this quantization to the standard one , but we will not yet use it to complete the quantization of the hamiltonian constraint and attempt an analysis of the physical differences that would result .",
    "we should say that there are other conceivable applications of the wigner functions besides the one we demonstrate in this paper . to give an example we recall that recently a method has been established in lqc that allows to calculate effective equations of motion within a systematic approximation scheme @xcite .",
    "weyl ordering figures prominently in this method and thus we expect that the wigner function techniques from the present paper may also be useful in that context .    the paper is organized as follows : we start by giving a brief review of the properties of the wigner function in ordinary quantum mechanics in section [ se_review ] . in section [ se_rbohr ]",
    "we generalize its definition to quantum mechanics on the bohr compactification @xmath3 , and list analogous properties . in section [ se_applications ]",
    "we sketch an application to lqc .",
    "we finish with a discussion of our results and the possibility of a generalization to loop quantum gravity in section [ se_discussion ] .",
    "in the present section we will recall the definition of the wigner function for quantum mechanics on the real line .",
    "we will follow closely the exposition in @xcite ( and refer to it for proofs and details ) although with slightly different conventions .",
    "our fourier transform convention will be @xmath5 we write the scalar product on @xmath6 as @xmath7 , and denote the schwartz test functions on @xmath4 by @xmath8 .",
    "we introduce the usual position and momentum operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "the wigner function @xmath13 of a wave function is conveniently defined as a special case @xmath14 of the wigner transform @xmath15 of a _ pair _ of wave functions , in turn defined by the following equivalent expressions : @xmath16 some of its basic properties are as follows ( see props . 1.92 and 1.96 in  @xcite )",
    ":    eq . defines the wigner transform as a sesquilinear map between the following spaces : @xmath17 with the last of these a continuous extension of the others , and @xmath18 denoting continuous functions vanishing at infinity . on @xmath19",
    "the wigner transform has the overlap property @xmath20 and is hermitian : @xmath21 furthermore , for @xmath12 , @xmath22 has marginal distributions @xmath23 and the same is true ( modulo technical details ) for @xmath24 .",
    "we note in particular that according to , @xmath22 is real",
    ". moreover , its `` marginals '' are the quantum mechanical probability distributions for measurements of position and momentum according to .",
    "however , @xmath22 fails to be a joint probability distribution because it is not positive in general .",
    "it is positive precisely for gaussian states , arguably the most classical quantum states :    [ pr_gauss ] for @xmath24 , @xmath25 it holds that @xmath26    in this sense the wigner function is as close to a classical joint probability distribution in position and momentum as quantum mechanics allows .",
    "the wigner function can also be used in quantization : as per , @xmath27 whenever @xmath28 is in the domain of the respective operators .",
    "also it is easy to calculate @xmath29 which shows a relation to quantization by symmetric ordering .",
    "in fact this relation carries on much further : for phase space functions @xmath30 in @xmath31 , we may define a quantization @xmath32 of @xmath33 by the bochner integral @xmath34\\ , \\frac{\\text{d}x\\text{d}p}{2\\pi}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 one can even extend this definition to @xmath30 which are in @xmath36 .",
    "the matrix elements of this operator are determined in a very simple manner from the wigner function and the symbol @xmath33 :    [ pr_calculus ] for @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39    after this brief exposition of the properties of the wigner function on @xmath4 , we can turn now to the actual topic of this paper .",
    "in the present section we define the wigner function for wave functions on the bohr compactification of the real line , and derive some of its properties .",
    "we will start by recalling some basic facts about harmonic analysis on abelian groups and the definition of @xmath3 . a good reference for these matters",
    "is @xcite .    given any locally compact abelian group @xmath40 , one can form the dual group @xmath41 as the abelian group of ( continuous ) characters of @xmath40 .",
    "multiplication in @xmath41 is given by pointwise multiplication of characters , the inverse by complex conjugation , and the topology by uniform convergence on compact sets . with this topology",
    "@xmath41 itself becomes a locally compact group .",
    "there is a natural isomorphism between @xmath40 and its double - dual .    as locally compact abelian groups , @xmath40 and @xmath41 have unique ( up to scaling ) haar measures @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "fourier transform can be defined as @xmath44 for a character @xmath45 of @xmath40 .",
    "the normalization of the haar measures can be chosen such that fourier transform becomes an isomorphism @xmath46 a locally compact abelian group @xmath40 is compact iff @xmath41 is discrete .",
    "this is used to define the bohr compactification @xmath47 of a locally compact group @xmath40 : @xmath47 is defined as the dual group of @xmath48 , with the latter being @xmath41 as far as group structure is concerned , but equipped with the _ discrete _ topology . for the reals this works out as follows .",
    "let @xmath40 be the additive group of real numbers @xmath49 with its usual topology , which we think of as the configuration space of ordinary quantum mechanics in one dimension .",
    "the characters of @xmath40 are precisely the functions @xmath50 given by @xmath51\\ ] ] labelled by @xmath52 , and form a group @xmath41 isomorphic to @xmath53 with the usual topology , i.e. , the usual momentum space . thus @xmath48 is the additive group of real numbers with the discrete topology .",
    "since this group is discrete and abelian , its characters form a compact abelian group @xmath54 , which we will also denote @xmath3 .",
    "now each real number @xmath55 defines an obvious character @xmath56 of @xmath57 and this correspondence embeds @xmath53 as a dense subgroup of @xmath3 , justifying the description of @xmath3 as a compactification of the real line .",
    "the reason that there are more characters of @xmath57 than of @xmath41 is that there is now no continuity requirement in the @xmath58 variable ( or more precisely , continuity is required with respect to the discrete topology )",
    ". it will be convenient to denote the character on @xmath57 corresponding to any @xmath59 by @xmath60 ; on the other hand the maps @xmath61 for @xmath52 define characters on @xmath3 , which continuously extend the formula from @xmath4 to @xmath3 .",
    "both @xmath3 and @xmath57 carry haar - measures @xmath62 , @xmath63 : @xmath63 is just the counting measure on @xmath4 , @xmath64 and @xmath62 is characterized by @xmath65 fourier transformation @xmath66 is an isomorphism @xmath67 .",
    "the characters @xmath68 form an uncountable orthonormal basis in @xmath69 , which is therefore inseparable .",
    "we will also use the hilbert spaces @xmath70 and @xmath71 which are isomorphic under the partial fourier transform in the first variable @xmath72    let us define some further function spaces ( which roughly correspond to the schwartz spaces occuring in the theory on @xmath4 ) .",
    "denote by @xmath73    some remarks about this definition : first , any element @xmath74 may be written as a finite sum @xmath75 where the fourier coefficients @xmath76 of @xmath2 vanish for all but finitely many @xmath52 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath77 consists of all complex - valued functions on @xmath4 which are nonzero only at finitely many points .",
    "second , @xmath78 , the finite span of functions @xmath79 on @xmath80 with @xmath81 , @xmath82 , can be described equivalently as the set of functions @xmath83 on @xmath80 that are in @xmath84 for fixed @xmath85 and in @xmath77 for fixed @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath78 is a @xmath86-algebra under pointwise linear combination , products and complex conjugation ; its elements are absolutely integrable with respect to the product measure @xmath87 on @xmath80 and hence can be integrated as nested integrals in either order .",
    "we shall also make use of the algebraic duals of these spaces , which can be easily characterised : the dual @xmath88 of @xmath77 consists of all functionals @xmath89 of the form @xmath90 where @xmath91 is any complex - valued function on @xmath4 ; while @xmath92 is the image of @xmath88 under the dual of the fourier transform .",
    "thus @xmath92 consists of all functionals @xmath93 of the form @xmath94 where the fourier coefficients @xmath95 form an arbitrary complex - valued function @xmath96 on @xmath4 .",
    "the fourier transform then extends to a map from @xmath92 to @xmath88 so that @xmath97 whereupon the parseval identity holds in the form @xmath98    there is a particular class of distributions over @xmath84 whose action can be expressed in terms of the restriction of cylindrical functions to the real line .",
    "[ le_reduction ] suppose @xmath99 has the property that @xmath100 is the fourier transform of a finite complex measure @xmath101 on @xmath4 , @xmath102 ( in particular , this holds if @xmath103 is a schwartz function on @xmath4 ) .",
    "then the action of @xmath104 on any @xmath74 is @xmath105 which may be written @xmath106 if @xmath103 is of schwartz class , where @xmath107 is the usual fourier transform on @xmath4 , @xmath108 , and the measure @xmath109 is the usual lebesgue measure on @xmath4 .    by linearity",
    "it is enough to consider the case @xmath110 , for which @xmath111 . by definition ,",
    "the left - hand side of is @xmath112 , and the result follows .    in other words , this type of distribution over @xmath84 acts on a cylindrical function as integration of the cylindrical function restricted to @xmath4 with respect to a measure on @xmath4 .    for later use",

    "[ le_bochner ] under the hypotheses of lemma  [ le_reduction ] , if @xmath104 is positive ( i.e. , @xmath113 for all pointwise nonnegative @xmath74 ) then @xmath101 is a finite positive measure .    considering any cylindrical function of the form @xmath114 , and applying lemma  [ le_reduction ] , we see that @xmath115 thus the fourier transform of @xmath101 is a function of positive type , and",
    "hence @xmath101 is a positive measure by bochner s theorem ( theorem ix.9 in @xcite ) .",
    "finally we define the operators @xmath116 ( @xmath52 ) and @xmath117 by their actions @xmath118 on wave functions @xmath74 ; each @xmath116 extends to a bounded operator on @xmath119 .",

    "while this definition seems reasonable , its merits should ultimately be found in its properties .",
    "so let us look at some of those , next .",
    "the wigner transform is a sesquilinear map @xmath128 and extends to maps between the following spaces : @xmath129 on @xmath130 the wigner transform has the overlap property @xmath131 and is hermitean : @xmath132 furthermore , for @xmath74 , @xmath133    first look at the assertion . for @xmath134 and any given @xmath58 , @xmath135 is nonzero for only finitely many @xmath136 , hence the integral in amounts to a finite sum , and thus for fixed @xmath58",

    "the latter also holds modulo technical refinements in the case @xmath153 , but we will not pursue this here .      in the standard",

    "our purpose in this subsection is to investigate this issue for the wigner functions of elements of @xmath84 and @xmath92 .",

    "the situation is however drastically different .",
    "the limit is well defined , giving a kronecker delta on @xmath57 and a character on @xmath3 .",
    "given this , the statement of lemma [ le_weird ] is perhaps less surprising .",
    "next we present a converse to prop .",

    "the proof is straightforward , noting that @xmath224 this answers the question , albeit only for symbols @xmath33 in @xmath78 .",
    "what about more general symbols ?",
    "if @xmath33 is only in @xmath219 it is not clear whether the integration in converges or not , so this seems to be too general .",
    "on the other hand there are functions @xmath33 that are not even in @xmath152 , for which _ does _ make sense . for our purposes , it will be sufficient to restrict to the symbol classes defined in the following result :    \\(a ) let @xmath225 be the set of distributions @xmath33 such that @xmath226 then for any @xmath227 , defines a ( possibly unbounded ) operator @xmath32 with domain @xmath84 .",
    "+ ( b ) let @xmath228 be the set of distributions @xmath33 for which there exist constants @xmath229 such that @xmath230 and @xmath231 for each such @xmath33 , the operator @xmath32 extends to a bounded operator ( also denoted @xmath32 ) on @xmath119 with @xmath232 moreover , the adjoint @xmath233 is the quantization of @xmath234 .",
    "\\(a ) is trivial ; while ( b ) is immediate from the schur test ( theorem 5.2 in  @xcite ) .",
    "the statement about the adjoint follows on noting that @xmath235    we remark that for example any function @xmath236 on @xmath80 which is in @xmath84 for fixed @xmath85 belongs to @xmath237 .    what does the quantization give",
    "straightforward calculations show the following    for @xmath238 and @xmath239 @xmath240 for @xmath241 @xmath242    we note that the latter is the totally symmetric ordering of @xmath243 , thus one should think of the quantization given by as weyl quantization .",
    "weyl ordering is interesting because of its properties ( see @xcite for a discussion ) , and it has become important in loop quantum cosmology because it was used in a novel method for obtaining effective equations of motion from the quantum theory @xcite .",
    "as we have pointed out above , the wigner function can be used to quantize phase space functions in a systematic way . in the following",
    "we will apply this technique in a case that is of importance to lqc .",
    "more generally we expect that this formalism will be useful in the context of obtaining effective equations of motion from the quantum theory @xcite , and for cases in which complicated phase space functions have to be quantized .",
    "the example we discuss here is important in the context of describing homogenous and isotropic cosmology coupled to a scalar field in the framework of lqc @xcite .",
    "it was found there that the standard way of quantizing the hamiltonian constraint ( e.g.  @xcite ) led to physically unacceptable results , and a new quantization was introduced in @xcite . in very brief terms , it can be described as follows : as customary in lqc , before quantization the curvature is expressed in terms of the connection along a small edge .",
    "formerly this edge was taken to have a length proportional to the smallest quantum of length in the full theory , as measured in a fiducial background metric .",
    "the basic idea of ashtekar , pawlowski and singh ( aps ) @xcite is to determine it in a similar way , but with respect to the physical metric which is subject to quantization . on a technical level",
    "this requires quantization of the phase space function @xmath244 where @xmath245 is a function fulfilling @xmath246 the new symbol @xmath247 replaces the function @xmath248 in the old quantization of the constraint , which is constant in @xmath58 . only up to sign .",
    "we will choose @xmath245 positive , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "] according to @xcite , @xmath249 was chosen as @xmath250 .",
    "obviously quantization of necessitates a choice of ordering . in @xcite a quantization was arrived at in the following fashion : naively @xmath55 would be quantized by a derivative in @xmath58 . that derivative , and hence an operator corresponding to @xmath55 , fail to exist on functions in @xmath77 however .",
    "nevertheless one can study the action of the operator @xmath251^n\\ ] ] on smooth functions on @xmath4 .",
    "this action is given by pullback with a certain diffeomorphism of @xmath4 , and it continues to make sense on functions in @xmath77 .",
    "the upshot is that aps define an operator @xmath252 on @xmath84 by @xmath253 where @xmath254 is a specific numerical constant .",
    "this quantization is very plausible for a number of reasons .",
    "first , @xmath252 is a unitary operator .",
    "second , although looks very complicated , it can be given a simple interpretation : @xmath252 is a constant shift on wave functions over the _",
    "volume_. third , maybe most importantly , it ultimately leads to a hamiltonian constraint that is physically viable .",
    "still , since is at least partly motivated by reference to a differentiable structure on @xmath57 ,  something that does not exist  it may be interesting to consider alternatives .",
    "therefore we proceed now to quantize the same classical function using the wigner transform .",
    "the symbol @xmath247 from equation is undefined at @xmath255 , and we will remedy this by setting @xmath256 . although this appears _",
    "ad hoc _ , it will be shown below that the same results are obtained by taking limits of quantized operators formed from regularised versions of @xmath245 . with that end in view ,",
    "let us first consider general symbols of the form @xmath257 where @xmath258 .",
    "noting that @xmath259 , we have @xmath260 accordingly , the properties of the quantisation @xmath261 are closely related to the properties of equation @xmath262 in particular , if there are constants @xmath204 and @xmath205 such that has at most @xmath204 ( resp . ,",
    "@xmath205 ) solutions for @xmath263 ( resp . , @xmath264 ) for each fixed @xmath264 ( resp . , @xmath263 ) then @xmath265 and @xmath266 .",
    "we will now restrict to functions @xmath267 for which this condition holds .",
    "one may also note that @xmath268 where @xmath269 is the set of @xmath264 solving for the given @xmath263 .",
    "it follows that @xmath261 is unitary if and only if implicitly defines a bijection @xmath270 of @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , @xmath271 is precisely of this form for a suitable @xmath267 .    for the particular symbol @xmath247 of interest , the above remarks are valid modulo the special treatment of @xmath255 ; the upshot is that @xmath272 where @xmath273 is the set of solutions @xmath274 to @xmath275 .",
    "equivalently , these are the solutions to @xmath276 ; analysis of this equation reveals that there are one , two , or three solutions for fixed @xmath263 according to whether @xmath263 is greater than , equal to , or less than @xmath277 .",
    "( this is illustrated in the first diagram in figure [ fi_separate ] , in which the solutions would be the intersections of an @xmath278const .",
    "line with the graph . )",
    "the same is true for solutions in @xmath263 for fixed @xmath264 ; it therefore follows that @xmath279 and that we have @xmath280 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath271 , then , @xmath281 is not unitary .",
    "the relationship between @xmath281 and @xmath271 will be discussed further below ; first , we show how @xmath281 may be obtained as a limit of quantizations based on regularised versions of @xmath245 .",
    "a function @xmath258 will be called an _ @xmath282-regularisation _ of @xmath245 if @xmath283 for @xmath284 and @xmath267 is concave on @xmath285 .",
    "( concavity is adopted here for convenience ; much weaker conditions would also suffice . )",
    "thus , for example , taking @xmath286 on @xmath285 would give an @xmath282-regularisation , but there are many other possibilities .",
    "let @xmath267 be any @xmath282-regularisation of @xmath287 .",
    "then @xmath265 and @xmath288 .",
    "first note that every solution to with @xmath289 is a solution to with @xmath290 .",
    "we have already seen that there are at most @xmath291 solutions to this equation for @xmath264 ( resp . ,",
    "@xmath263 ) at fixed @xmath263 ( resp . , @xmath264 ) .",
    "it remains to consider solutions with @xmath292 .",
    "fixing @xmath263 , these solutions correspond to intersections of the graph of @xmath267 with a straight line , and there can be at most two of these in this region because @xmath267 is concave on @xmath293 $ ] .",
    "the same is true if we fix @xmath264 .",
    "accordingly there are at most @xmath294 solutions to on lines of constant @xmath263 or @xmath264 .",
    "the result follows by the foregoing discussion .",
    "[ pr_newholonomy ] let @xmath295 be any sequence of @xmath296-regularisations of @xmath245 with @xmath297 .",
    "then the sequence of operators @xmath298 converges strongly to the operator @xmath281 defined above .",
    "as the operators in the sequence are all bounded with norm less than @xmath294 , it is enough to prove strong convergence on the dense subspace @xmath84 of @xmath119 . in turn",
    ", it therefore suffices to establish strong convergence of the sequence applied to each character @xmath299 .",
    "fix @xmath300 and choose @xmath301 large enough that @xmath273 has no intersection with @xmath302 $ ] for @xmath303 .",
    "this is possible because @xmath273 is finite and excludes @xmath304 . for such @xmath305",
    ", @xmath306 is the union of disjoint sets @xmath273 and @xmath307\\ ] ] so we may write @xmath308 we now claim that @xmath309 is empty for all sufficiently large @xmath305 , thus establishing that @xmath310 and hence ( as @xmath263 is arbitrary ) the required result .",
    "the claim is proved as follows : if @xmath311 then @xmath312 , and hence @xmath313 .",
    "but by concavity @xmath314 for @xmath315 . as @xmath316 it is therefore clear that for all sufficiently large @xmath305 there are no solutions to @xmath317 ; hence @xmath309 is empty as required .    in view of these results",
    ", we are encouraged to regard the choice @xmath256 as well - motivated , and @xmath281 as an appropriate weyl quantization of the original symbol defined ( for @xmath318 ) in . to visualize the results of the above proposition , and to get a better feeling for the action of @xmath281",
    ", it is helpful to plot the space of solutions to with @xmath319 . instead of solving that equation directly , we will give a parametrization of its solution space : it is easily checked that @xmath320 this set is plotted as a graph in the @xmath321-plane in the first diagram of figure [ fi_separate ] .",
    "many of the properties of @xmath281 stated in the previous lemma can also be obtained from a visual inspection of what we will call its ` matrix representation ' .",
    "it will also be useful in the comparison of @xmath281 , @xmath252 , and @xmath322 .",
    "note that all these operators have only matrix elements equal to 1 or 0 in the basis @xmath84 .",
    "so we can visualize them by plotting the set of matrix elements @xmath323 that are equal to 1 as a set in the plane .",
    "this is done in figure [ fi_separate ] for the operators separately , and in figure [ fi_all ] , for easy comparison , into one diagram .",
    "one can see how , for example , @xmath281 is not unitary , because its graph is that of a _ multi - valued _ function .",
    "let us compare the operator @xmath281 that we obtained here with @xmath252 of @xcite : the first difference is that @xmath252 unitary in contrast to @xmath281 .",
    "another difference is the `` spike '' in the graph for @xmath281 : whereas the graph of @xmath281 has a part ( solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fi_branches ] , that is very similar to @xmath252 , and can be characterized by @xmath324 for large @xmath264 and @xmath263 , the graph also has a part that is very different ( drawn as a dashed line in figure [ fi_branches ] ) , that can be characterized by @xmath325 , @xmath326 .",
    "this new feature may point to difficulties with the semiclassical limit for this operator because , loosely speaking , states with large momentum eigenvalues correspond to a universe with large spatial extension , and the operator is obviously changed on those large volume states , as compared to @xmath252 and @xmath322 . on the other hand , in the present model eigenstates of momentum @xmath58 and @xmath327 are physically identical which is a symmetry of the system , see @xcite for details . ] whence the two parts of the graph of @xmath281 ( dashed and solid respectively , in fig . [ fi_branches ] ) may act in a very similar way on the physical level .",
    "ultimately one will have to construct the full hamiltonian constraint using the operator @xmath281 and compare the physical results to those obtained in @xcite , and we see no problems of principle for doing this .",
    "in particular we note that using @xmath281 will give a hamiltonian constraint that commutes with the action of the parity operator @xmath328 , since one finds that @xmath329 also with this quantization .",
    "the analysis will be substantially more complicated since it does not seem that there is a basis in which the action of @xmath281 drastically simplifies ( such as is the case for @xmath252 with respect to the volume eigenvector basis ) . in particular it does not seem to be likely that the kinematical hilbert space will be decomposable into different superselection sectors as was the case in other quantizations .",
    "that said , we will leave a detailed analysis for the future , and turn now to a discussion of the results of the present paper .",
    "in the present paper we have given a definition of the wigner function for wave functions over the bohr compactification @xmath3 of the real line and shown that our definition possesses many properties analogous to the wigner function in ordinary quantum mechanics .    since wave functions over the bohr compactification figure",
    "prominently in loop quantum cosmology , the wigner function should be of use in that context . to demonstrate this",
    ", we used the wigner function machinery to give an alternative quantization of an important building block of the hamiltonian constraint for homogenous isotropic cosmology as treated in lqc @xcite .",
    "we should stress again that the ordering chosen in @xcite has many desirable properties and we do not want to claim in any way that it is wrong or inappropriate . rather , by adding weyl quantization to the toolbox of those working in lqc , we provide a quantization method that is applicable to a wide variety of situations , without the need to make any _ ad hoc _ choices . whether the results are physically viable must still be determined in each instance separately .",
    "the content of the present paper could be further developed in several directions : on the mathematical side , a more detailed investigation of the properties of the quantization map ( e.g. , with respect to products , or the semiclassical limit ) could be undertaken .",
    "on the physical side , the quantization of the hamiltonian constraint using the operator @xmath281 from should be completed .",
    "then its physical implications need to be analyzed , along the lines of , say @xcite .",
    "one should also consider application of the weyl quantization in cases in which the method from @xcite can not be directly applied .",
    "an example for this would be homogenous but non - isotropic cosmologies .",
    "but arguably the most interesting extension of the present work would consist in finding a generalization of the wigner function to the quantum field theoretic context of full loop quantum gravity .",
    "this seems to be , at the same time , a very challenging undertaking . in the full theory wave functions",
    "live , roughly speaking , on a certain inductive limit of products of the lie group @xmath330 .",
    "so the two main problems we expect are 1 ) the definition of a `` good '' wigner function on @xmath330 that 2 ) interacts well with taking the inductive limit .",
