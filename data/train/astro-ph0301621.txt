    "the best established stellar distance indicators , cepheids and rrlyrae , suffer from two major problems , extinction and metallicity dependence , both of which are difficult to determine for these objects with sufficient precision .",
    "thus , in order to improve distance determinations in the local universe and to assess the influence of systematic errors there is definitely a need for alternative distance indicators , which are at least as accurate but are not affected by uncertainties arising from extinction or metallicity .",
    "it is our conviction that blue supergiants are ideal objects for this purpose .",
    "the big advantage is the enormous intrinsic brightness in visual light , which makes them available for accurate quantitative spectroscopic studies even far beyond the local group using the new generation of 8m - class telescopes and the extremely efficient multi - object spectrographs attached to them @xcite .",
    "quantitative spectroscopy allows us to determine the stellar parameters and thus the intrinsic energy distribution , which can then be used to measure reddening and the extinction law .",
    "in addition , metallicity can be derived from the spectra .",
    "we emphasize that a reliable _ spectroscopic _ distance indicator will always be superior , since an enormous amount of additional information comes for free , as soon as one is able to obtain a reasonable spectrum .    in this review",
    "we concentrate on blue supergiants of spectral types late b to early a. these are the the brightest `` normal '' stars at visual light with absolute magnitudes @xmath0 , see @xcite . by `` normal '' we mean stars evolving peacefully without showing signs of eruptions or explosions , which are difficult to handle theoretically and observationally .",
    "figure  [ hrd ] shows the location of these objects in a hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) with theoretical evolutionary tracks . with initial zams - masses between 15 and 40m@xmath1",
    "they do not belong to the most massive and the most luminous stars in galaxies .",
    "o - stars can be significantly more massive and luminous , however , because of their high atmospheric temperatures they emit most of their radiation in the extreme and far uv . late b and early a supergiants are cooler and because of wien s law their bolometric corrections are small so that their brightness at visual light reaches a maximum value during stellar evolution .        in the temperature range of late b and",
    "early a - supergiants there are also always a few objects brighter than m@xmath2@xmath3@xmath49.5 . generally , those are more exotic objects such as luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) with higher initial masses and with spectra characterized by strong emission lines and sometimes in dramatic evolutionary phases with outbursts and eruptions . although their potential as distance indicators is also very promising , we regard the physics of their evolution and atmospheres as too complicated at this point and , thus , exclude them from our discussion .",
    "the objects of our interest evolve smoothly from the left to the right in the hrd crossing the temperature range of late b and early a - supergiants on the order of several @xmath5 years @xcite . during this short evolutionary phase stellar",
    "winds with mass - loss rates of the order @xmath6 m@xmath1yr@xmath7 or less @xcite do not have time enough to reduce the mass of the star significantly so that the mass remains constant .",
    "in addition , as fig .",
    "[ hrd ] shows , the luminosity stays constant as well .",
    "the fact that the evolution of these objects can very simply be described by constant mass , luminosity and a straightforward mass - luminosity relationship makes them a very attractive stellar distance indicator , as we will explain later in this review .    as evolved objects the blue supergiants are older than their o - star progenitors , with ages between 0.5 to 1.3@xmath8@xmath9 years @xcite .",
    "all galaxies with ongoing star formation or bursts of this age will show such a population .",
    "because of their age they are spatially less concentrated around their place of birth than o - stars and can frequently be found as isolated field stars .",
    "this together with their intrinsic brightness makes them less vulnerable as distance indicators against the effects of crowding even at larger distances , where less luminous objects such as cepheids and rrlyrae start to have problems .    with regard to the crowding problem",
    "we also note that the short evolutionary time of @xmath5 years makes it generally very unlikely that an unresolved blend of two supergiants with very similar spectral types is observed . on the other hand ,",
    "since we are dealing with spectroscopic distance indicators , any contribution of unresolved additional objects of different spectral type is detected immediately , as soon as it affects the total magnitude significantly .",
    "thus , it is very obvious that blue supergiants seem to be ideal to investigate the properties of young populations in galaxies .",
    "they can be used to study reddening laws and extinction , detailed chemical composition , i.e. not only abundance patterns but also gradients of abundance patterns as a function of galactocentric distance , the properties of stellar winds as function of chemical composition and the evolution of stars in different galactic environment .",
    "most importantly , as we will demonstrate below , they are excellent distance indicators .",
    "it is also very obvious that the use of blue supergiants as tools to understand the physics of galaxies and to determine their distances depends very strongly on the accuracy of the spectral diagnostic methods which are applied .",
    "the attractiveness of blue supergiants for extragalactic work , namely their outstanding intrinsic brightness , has also always posed a tremendous theoretical problem . the enormous energy and momentum density contained in their photospheric radiation field leads to significant departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium and to stellar wind outflows driven by radiation .",
    "it has long been a problem to model non - lte and radiation driven winds realistically , but significant theoretical progress was made during the past decade resulting in powerful spectroscopic diagnostic tools which allow to determine the properties of supergiant stars with high precision .",
    "we describe the status quo of the spectroscopic diagnostics in the following chapters .",
    "we will then demonstrate how the spectroscopic information can be used to determine distances .",
    "we will introduce two completely independent theoretical concepts for distance determination methods .",
    "the first method , the wind momentum  luminosity relationship ( wlr ) , uses the strengths of the radiation driven stellar winds as observed through the diagnostics of h@xmath10 as a measure of absolute luminosity and , therefore , distance .",
    "the second method , the flux - weighted gravity  luminosity relationship ( fglr ) , determines the stellar gravities from all the higher balmer lines and uses gravity divided by the fourth power of effective temperature as a precise measure of absolute magnitude . a short discussion of the potential of these new concepts will conclude the paper .",
    "the physics of the atmospheres of blue supergiant stars is complex and very different from standard stellar atmosphere models .",
    "they are dominated by the influence of the radiation field , which is characterized by energy densities larger than or of the same order as the energy density of atmospheric matter .",
    "another important characteristic are the low gravities , which lead to extremely low densities and an extended atmospheric plasma with very low escape velocity from the star .",
    "this has two important consequences .",
    "first , severe departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) of the level populations in the entire atmosphere are induced , because radiative transitions between ionic energy levels become much more important than inelastic collisions with free electrons .",
    "second , a supersonic hydrodynamic outflow of atmospheric matter is initiated by line absorption of photons transferring outwardly directed momentum to the atmospheric plasma .",
    "this latter mechanism is responsible for the existence of the strong stellar winds observed .",
    "stellar winds can affect the structure of the outer atmospheric layers substantially and change the profiles of strong optical lines such as h@xmath10 and h@xmath11 significantly .",
    "the effects of the departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( `` nlte '' ) can also become crucial depending on the atomic properties of the ion investigated .",
    "a comprehensive and detailed discussion of the basic physics behind these effects and the advancement of model atmosphere work for blue supergiants is given in @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "more recent work is described in @xcite,@xcite and  @xcite .    for late b and",
    "early a - supergiants considerable progress has been made during the last four years in the development of a very detailed and accurate modelling of the nlte radiative transfer enabling very precise determinations of stellar parameters and chemical abundances , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ nitro ] gives an impression of the effort put into the atomic models and corresponding radiative transfer of individual ions .",
    "+      effective temperature t@xmath12 and gravity @xmath13 are the most fundamental atmospheric parameters . they are usually determined by fitting simultaneously two sets of spectral lines , one depending mostly on t@xmath12 and the other on @xmath13 . figure  [ ftg ] indicates how this is done in principle .",
    "when fitting the ionization equilibria of elements spectral lines of two or more ionization stages have to be brought into simultaneous agreement with observations . at different locations in the ( @xmath13 , log t@xmath12)-plane",
    "this can be achieved only for different elemental abundances .",

    "along the dashed curve the computed spectral lines of two different ionization stages of one element agree with the observations .",

    "the difference is caused by the re - emission process after the photon has been absorbed within the line transition .",
    "if the photon is immediately re - emitted by spontaneous emission , then we have the case of line scattering with a source function proportional to the geometrical dilution of the radiation field and a p - cygni profile will result . if the re - emission occurs as a result of a different atomic process , for instance after a recombination of an electron into the upper level or after a spontaneous decay of a higher level into the upper level or after a collision , then the line source function will possibly not dilute and may roughly stay constant as a function of radius so that an emission line results .",

    "the important points are the following .",
    "unlike the case of late type stars , crowding and blending of lines is not a severe problem for hot massive stars , as long as we restrict our investigation to the visual part of the spectrum .",
    "in addition , it is important to realize that massive stars have angular momentum , which leads to usually high rotational velocities . even for a - supergiants , which have already expanded their radius considerably during their evolution and , thus ,",
    "have slowed down their rotation , the observed projected rotational velocities are still on the order of 30kms@xmath7 or higher .",
    "this means that the intrinsic full half - widths of metal lines are on the order of 1 . in consequence , for the detailed studies of supergiants in the local group a resolution of 25,000 sampling",
    "a line with five data points is ideal .",
    "this is indeed the resolution , which has been applied in most of the work referred to in the previous sections .",
    "however , as we have found out empirically @xcite , degrading the resolution to 5,000 ( fwhm = 1 ) has only a small effect on the accuracy of the diagnostics , as long as the s / n remains high ( i.e. 50 or better ) . even for a resolution of 2,500",
    "( fwhm = 2 ) it is still possible to determine t@xmath12 to an accuracy of 2 percent , @xmath13 to 0.05 dex and individual element abundances to 0.1 or 0.2dex .",
    "references @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have used fors at the vlt with a resolution of 1,000 ( fwhm = 5 ) to study blue supergiants far beyond the local group .",
    "the accuracy in the determination of stellar properties at this rather low resolution is still remarkable .",
    "the effective temperature is accurate to roughly 4 percent and the determination of gravity remains unaffected and is still good to 0.05dex ( an explanation will be given in sect .",
    "however , at this resolution it becomes difficult to determine abundance patterns of individual elements ( except for emission line stars , see @xcite ) and , thus , one is restricted to the determination of the overall metallicity which is still accurate to 0.2dex .",
    "we can conclude that an optimum for extragalactic work is a resolution of 2,500 ( fwhm = 2 ) .",
    "blue supergiants are bright enough even far beyond the local group to allow the achievement of high s / n with reasonable exposure times at 8m - class telescopes with efficient multi - object spectrographs at this resolution , which then makes it possible to determine stellar parameters and chemical composition with sufficient precision .",
    "this resolution is also good enough to determine stellar wind parameters from the observed h@xmath10 profiles , since the stellar wind velocities ( and therefore the corresponding line widths ) are larger than 150kms@xmath7 .",
    "the concept of the wind momentum  luminosity relationship ( wlr ) has been introduced by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it starts from a very simple idea .",
    "the winds of blue supergiants are initiated and maintained by the absorption of photospheric radiation and the photon momentum connected to it .",
    "thus , the mechanical momentum flow of a stellar wind @xmath28 should be a function of the photon momentum rate @xmath29 provided by the stellar photosphere and interior    @xmath30    if this is true and if we are able to find this function @xmath31 , this would enable us to determine directly stellar luminosities from the stellar wind by using the inverse relation @xmath32    in other words , by measuring the rate of mass - loss and the terminal velocity directly from the spectrum we would be able to determine the luminosity of a blue supergiant .",
    "this is an exciting perspective , because it would give us a completely new , purely spectroscopic tool to determine stellar distances .",
    "quantitative spectroscopy would yield @xmath33 , gravity , abundances , intrinsic colours , reddening , extinction , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . with the luminosity from the above relation one",
    "could then compare with the dereddened apparent magnitude to derive a distance .    in the previous section",
    ", we already demonstrated how @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be determined from the spectrum with high precision .",
    "thus , deriving the theoretical relationship and confirming and calibrating it observationally will enable us to introduce a new distance determination method .",
    "an accurate analytical solution of the hydrodynamic equations of line driven winds has been provided by @xcite .",
    "these solutions were then used by @xcite and @xcite to exactly derive the relationship . here , we apply a simplified approach ,",
    "see also  @xcite , which is not exact but gives insight in the underlying physics .",
    "is the spectral luminosity at frequency @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 is the wind outflow velocity at radius @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the mass density ]    we assume that the wind is stationary and spherical symmetric and obeys the equation of continuity @xmath40    then we consider the star as a point source of photons irradiating and accelerating its own stellar wind ( see fig.[wlrsy ] ) and calculate the amount of photon momentum absorbed by one spectral line @xmath41 the first factor on the left side gives the total photon momentum rate provided by the star , the second describes the fraction absorbed by one spectral line in an outer shell of thickness @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 is the optical thickness of such an outer shell in the line transition @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 is the stellar spectral luminosity at the frequency of line @xmath44 multiplied by the spectral width of the line .",
    "this luminosity can in principle be absorbed by the line if it is entirely optically thick ( i.e. @xmath46 ) .",
    "however , depending on the optical thickness only the fraction @xmath47 is really absorbed .",
    "if we are in the supersonic part of the wind , then the spectral width @xmath48 is not determined by the thermal motion of the ions but rather by the increment of the velocity outflow @xmath49 via the doppler formula @xmath50 which leads to the right hand side of ( 4 ) .",
    "after calculation of the photon momentum absorbed by a single spectral line we can consider the momentum balance in the stellar wind .",
    "the photon momentum absorbed by all lines will just be a sum over all lines @xmath44 of the expression shown on the right hand side of ( 4 ) .",
    "almost all of this absorbed momentum will be transformed into gain of mechanical stellar wind flow momentum @xmath51 of the outer shell except the fraction @xmath52 , which is the momentum required to act against the gravitational force ( @xmath53 is the local gravitational acceleration and @xmath54 is the mass within the spherical stellar wind shell ) @xmath55 note that this momentum balance also includes the photon momentum transfer by thomson scattering , which leads to the correction factor @xmath56 in the local gravitational acceleration .",
    "now , the important next step is to deal with the sum over all lines in the above momentum balance . here",
    ", the complication arises from the term in parentheses containing the local optical depth @xmath43 of each line .",
    "@xmath43 will not only be different for each of the thousands of lines driving the wind , it will also vary through the stellar wind as a function of radius . on the other hand ,",
    "one of the enormous simplifications in supersonically expanding envelopes around stars is that the optical thickness is well described by ( see for instance @xcite ) @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the thermal velocity of the ion and @xmath59 is the ( dimensionless ) _ line strength _ defined as @xmath60 i.e. the opacity of line @xmath44 @xmath61 in units of the continuous thomson scattering opacity or in units of the local density @xmath62 @xmath63 is the cross section for thomson scattering of photons on free electrons , @xmath64 the local number density of free electrons . in a hot plasma with hydrogen as the main constituent",
    "mostly ionized and with @xmath65 and @xmath66 the number of electrons provided per helium nucleus we have ( @xmath67 is the mass of the hydrogen atom ) @xmath68    thus , if the degree of ionization of helium is roughly constant as a function of radius @xmath38 in the wind , @xmath69 is also constant and we have @xmath70 with the line strength @xmath59 proportional to oscillator strength @xmath71 , wavelength @xmath72 and the occupation number @xmath73 of the lower level divided by the mass density @xmath39 @xmath74    thus , the line strength is roughly independent of the depth in the atmosphere and is determined by atomic physics ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) and atmospheric thermodynamics ( @xmath75 ) . since @xmath39 and @xmath76 vary strongly through the wind a line can be optically thick in deeper layers @xmath77 and can become optically thin further out @xmath78    for the calculation of the photon momentum transfer this means that line contributions can have an entirely different functional form depending on the optical thickness of the lines .",
    "this problem can be solved in a very elegant way by introducing a _ line strength distribution function _",
    "@xmath79    since the modern hydrodynamic model atmosphere codes ( see sect .",
    "2 ) contain atomic data and occupation numbers for millions of lines in nlte , we can investigate the physics of the line strength distribution function . as it turns out , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , the distribution in line strengths  to a very good approximation  obeys a power law @xmath80 independent ( to first order ) of the frequency .",
    "the exponent * @xmath81 * depends weakly on t@xmath12 and varies ( in the temperature range of ob - stars ) between @xmath82    @xmath81 is mostly determined by the atomic physics and basically reflects the distribution function of the oscillator strengths .",
    "one can , for instance , show that for the hydrogen atom the distribution of the lyman - series oscillator strengths is a power law with exponent @xmath83 , see  @xcite .",
    "it is important to realize that @xmath81 is not a free parameter but , instead , is well determined from the thousands of lines taken into account in the model atmosphere calculations .",
    "examples for the power law dependence of line strengths are given in @xcite or @xcite .    with the line strength distribution function",
    "we can replace the sum in the momentum balance by a double integral , which is then analytically solved ( see also @xcite ) :",
    "@xmath84    this means that the momentum transfer from photons to the stellar wind plasma depends non - linearly on the gradient of the velocity field .",
    "the degree of the non - linearity is determined by the steepness of the line strength distribution function * @xmath81*. @xmath85 is proportional to the number of lines in the line strength interval @xmath86 .",
    "we can now re - formulate the momentum balance to obtain @xmath87 yielding a non - linear differential equation for the stellar wind velocity ( note that we replaced the density through the mass conservation equation ) @xmath88 which looks much more complicated than it really is .",
    "the solution is easy , see  @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath34 as the uniquely determined eigenvalue of the problem @xmath89 and a terminal velocity proportional to the escape velocity @xmath90 @xmath91 combining the two yields the stellar wind momentum @xmath92 which  as expected  depends strongly on the luminosity but also on the photospheric radius and the expression in the parentheses , which contains the stellar mass and distance from the eddington limit .",
    "it is this expression which can vary significantly for different blue supergiants and , therefore , causes the large scatter in the observed correlations of mass - loss rates with luminosity and terminal velocity with escape velocity as discussed previously .",
    "however , for the product of mass - loss rate and terminal velocity , the stellar wind momentum rate , the exponent of the term in brackets should be  thanks to the laws of atomic physics  very close to zero , since @xmath93 .",
    "this means that to first order the wind momentum rate should be determined by @xmath94     +     this is the _ wind momentum - luminosity relationship_. it predicts a strong dependence of wind momentum rate on the stellar luminosity with an exponent determined by the statistics of the strengths of the tens of thousands of lines driving the wind .",
    "it also contains a weak dependence on stellar radius which comes from the fact that the stellar wind has to work against the gravitational potential when accelerated by photospheric photons .",
    "references @xcite , @xcite and @xcite were the first to prove that the theoretically predicted wlr is really observed .",
    "o - stars , b and a - supergiants all follow this relationship . as to be expected , the relationship depends on spectral types , since lines of different ionization stages contribute to the mechanism of line driving at different spectra types .",
    "f.  bresolin , in this volume  @xcite , gives a detailed overview about the most recent observational work on the wlr .",
    "here , we only want to show the recent best calibration for a - supergiants using ( only ) four milky way and two m31 objects in fig.[wlra ] .",
    "although a calibration based on merely six objects is only moderately convincing , we are again encouraged by the small scatter over the remarkable range in luminosity .",

    "kudritzki , in prep . ) , which are based on the new radiation driven wind algorithm developed by @xcite .",
    "the calculations provide a clear prediction about the metallicity dependence of a - supergiant wind momenta in agreement with previous work discussed in @xcite and the recent work by  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "f. bresolin , in this volume  @xcite , will discuss most recent extragalactic stellar wind diagnostics on blue supergiants and compare them with the model predictions .",
    "it is an old idea that the strengths of the hydrogen balmer lines and the absolute luminosities of massive stars must be related ( see @xcite in this volume for an overview ) .",
    "the concept behind this idea is very simple . because of the effects of stark broadening the balmer lines in hot stars are very sensitive to the number densities of electrons and protons in those atmospheric layers , where the wings of the balmer lines are formed .",
    "the number densities , on the other hand , depend on the photospheric gravity as the result of the hydrostatic equilibrium in stellar photospheres .",
    "stellar gravities , however , reflect the evolution of massive stars away from the zams ( where all gravities are roughly the same ) towards lower effective temperatures .",
    "they become smaller , as further the star evolves , and , if we compare objects with exactly the same effective temperature , more massive supergiant stars with higher luminosities are expected to have lower gravities than their counterparts with lower mass .",
    "we illustrate the situation by using the stellar evolution models from fig .",
    "we select three values of @xmath33@xmath312000 , 9500 and 8350k , corresponding to spectral types b8 , a0 and a4 , respectively ( see @xcite , this volume ) , and calculate absolute visual magnitudes and gravities for each track at each of the three @xmath33 values .",
    "figure  [ ewmv ] displays the corresponding correlation of @xmath95 with @xmath13 for each temperature .",
    "while the correlations are nicely parallel , the temperature dependence as a result of stellar evolution and bolometric correction is obvious .     and h@xmath96 equivalent width @xmath97 for three different values of @xmath33@xmath38350k ( _ crosses _ ) , 9500k ( _ squares _ ) ,",

    "this is also done in fig .",
    "since the strengths of the balmer lines do not only depend on gravity but also on temperature , the final correlation @xmath98 depends very strongly on @xmath33 .",
    "the equivalent widths are much stronger at lower @xmath33 and , as an additional complication , the slope of the correlation is strongly temperature dependent .",
    "while this result is , at least qualitatively , confirmed by observation @xcite , it is clear that simple empirical magnitude ",
    "equivalent width relations will have to suffer quite some intrinsic scatter unless it is restricted to accurate spectral sub - types .",
    "we , therefore , suggest a method , which overcomes the problem of the strong temperature dependence .",
    "before we do this important step , we draw attention to an important detail in fig .",
    "the plot equivalent width versus @xmath13 reveals that gravities can be determined with high precision for each effective temperature .",
    "an error of @xmath1610  percent in @xmath97 transforms to an error of 0.05 dex in @xmath13 . knowing that we will have many higher balmer lines in the blue spectra of supergiants we feel confident that we can determine gravities with such accuracies , even if the spectroscopic resolution is only moderate .",
    "we now turn to the derivation of the _ flux - weighted gravity ",
    "luminosity relationship _ ( fglr ) , which was introduced very recently by  @xcite . when discussing fig .",
    "[ hrd ] in sect .  1 we noted that massive stars evolve through the domain of blue supergiants with constant luminosity and constant mass .",
    "this has a very simple , but very important consequence for the relationship of gravity and effective temperature along each evolutionary track",
    ". from @xmath99 follows immediately that @xmath100    this means that each object of a certain initial mass on the zams has its specific value of the _ `` flux - weighted gravity '' g / t@xmath101 _ during the blue supergiant stage .",
    "this value is determined by the relationship between stellar mass and luminosity , which to a good approximation is a power law @xmath102    inspection of evolutionary calculations with mass - loss , cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , shows that @xmath103 is a good value in the range of luminosities considered , although @xmath104 changes towards higher masses . with the mass  luminosity power law",
    "we then obtain @xmath105 or with the definition of bolometric magnitude @xmath106@xmath107@xmath108 @xmath109    this is the fglr of blue supergiants .",
    "note that the proportionality constant @xmath110 is given by the exponent of the mass  luminosity power law through @xmath111 and @xmath112 for @xmath103 .",
    "mass - loss will depend on metallicity and therefore affect the mass  luminosity relation .",
    "in addition , stellar rotation through enhanced turbulent mixing might be important for this relation . in order to investigate these effects",
    "we have used the models of @xcite and  @xcite to construct the stellar evolution fglr , which is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fglrev ] .",
    "the result is very encouraging .",
    "all different models with or without rotation and with significantly different metallicity form a well defined very narrow fglr .     in the fglr ]    k and @xmath113 ( _ thick line _ ) and 1.65 ( _ thin line _ ) , respectively .",
    "the data were taken with fors at the vlt .",
    "for further discussion see @xcite ]    with this nice confirmation of our basic concept we discuss the possible observational scatter arising from uncertainties in the determination of @xmath33 and @xmath13 . as discussed in sect .  2 and as also demonstrated by @xcite , effective",
    "temperature and gravity can be determined within 4 percent and 0.05dex , respectively . treating these errors as independent we derive an expected one sigma scatter @xmath114mag for the fglr per individual object , which is again very encouraging and suggests that the method , after careful observational calibration ( see @xcite and @xcite , this volume ) , might become a powerful distance indicator .",
    "figure  [ balmfit ] demonstrates how precisely the balmer lines can be fitted to yield a very accurate @xmath13 and fig .",
    "[ fglr1 ] shows the first verification of the existence of a very tight fglr for spiral galaxies beyond the local group .",
    "further results are shown in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we conclude that blue supergiants provide a great potential as excellent extragalactic distance indicators .",
    "the quantitative analysis of their spectra  even at only moderate resolution  allows the determination of stellar parameters , stellar wind properties and chemical composition with remarkable precision .",
    "in addition , since the spectral analysis yields intrinsic energy distributions over the whole spectrum from the uv to the ir , multi - colour photometry can be used to determine reddening , extinction laws and extinction .",
    "this is a great advantage over classical distance indicators , for which only limited photometric information is available , when observed outside the local group .",
    "spectroscopy also allows to deal with the effects of crowding and multiplicity , as blue supergiants , due to their enormous brightness , are less affected by such problems than for instance cepheids , which are fainter .",
    "two tight relationships exist , the wlr and the fglr , which can be used to derive accurate absolute magnitudes from the spectrum with an accuracy of 0.3mag per individual object . applying the methods on objects brighter than @xmath115mag and using multi - object spectrographs at 8 to 10m - class telescopes , which allow for quantitative spectroscopy down to @xmath116mag , we estimate that with 20 objects per galaxy we will be able to determine distances out to distance moduli of @xmath117mag with an accuracy of 0.1mag .",
    "we note that these distances will not be affected by uncertainties in extinction and metallicity , because we will be able to derive the corresponding quantities from the spectrum .",

    "we gratefully acknowledge the hospitality and support of the local team .",
