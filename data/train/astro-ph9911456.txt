    "stars of horizontal - branch nature are important objects in studies of the older stellar populations and in studies of galactic structure in relation with formation theories for the milky way .",
    "their virtue lies in three properties .",
    "first , they have rather well defined absolute magnitudes and their distances are therefore easy to determine .",
    "second , their nature is such that they are easy to discover , in particular at higher galactic latitudes .",
    "third , the stellar evolution leading to such stars is in principle relatively well understood .",
    "the horizontal branch ( hb ) stellar phase is the core helium burning late stage of evolution of originally low to medium mass stars . during the red giant phase",
    "the stars have lost mass such that a helium core of @xmath1  m@xmath2 , surrounded by an outer shell of hydrogen gas , remains .",
    "for very thin shells , @xmath3 m@xmath2 , the stars are rather blue and of spectral class sdb ( subdwarf b ) , for ever thicker shells their atmospheres are cooler , leading to spectral types such as horizontal branch b and a ( hbb and hba ) and to the red hb ( rhb ) stars with @xmath4 m@xmath2 . between the hba and rhb stars",
    "lies the pulsational instability strip with the rr lyrae stars .",
    "( for the systematics of the spectral classification see de",
    "boer et al . 1997c . )",
    "hba and hbb stars are often called blue hb ( bhb ) stars , the even hotter sdb and sdo stars are also known as extended or extreme hb ( ehb ) stars .",
    "bhb and ehb stars can be easily found based on their blueness , the rr lyr stars due to their variability . of the bhb stars ,",
    "the hbas are easily identified , as their physical parameters differ from main sequence a stars , while hbbs may be confused with main sequence b stars . however , at higher galactical latitudes a or b main sequence stars are very rare .",
    "rhb stars can easily be confused with subgiants and giants because they lie in the same region of the hrd .    to trace the structure of the ( local part of the ) milky way one employs several techniques ( see also the review by majewski 1993 ) .",
    "the classical method is to perform star counts ( see , e.g. , bahcall & soneira 1984 ) .",
    "selecting stars based on their proper motion allows , if their radial velocities and distances are also determined , to study the true kinematics of the stars ( see , e.g. , carney et  al .",
    "1996 and papers cited there ) . basing oneself on proper motions one",
    "naturally studies the general group of more nearby stars extended by true high - velocity stars .",
    "another method is to sample distances and radial velocities of a specific set of stars , such as bhb or rr lyr stars , to investigate these parameters in a statistical manner ( see , e.g. , kinman et  al .",
    "1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "a more specific method is to observe statistically complete samples of stars of a special type in several directions to derive scale heights ( for sdb stars see e.g. , heber 1986 , moehler et  al .  1990 ,",
    "theissen et  al .",
    "1993 ) , or scale lengths in the milky way .",
    "a further possibility is to go beyond the present kinematic parameters by calculating orbits based on distances , radial velocities , and proper motions .",
    "this method has been used for high proper motion stars ( carney et  al .",
    "1996 ) , other dwarf stars ( schuster & allen 1997 ) , and for globular clusters ( dauphole et  al .",
    "also the orbits of sdb stars have been investigated ( colin et  al .",
    "1994 , de boer et  al .",
    "the latter study showed that most of the sdb stars have orbits staying fairly well inside the milky way disk , indicating that the sdb stars are not generally part of the halo population .    in the present study we have attempted to perform a similar analysis for hba and hbb stars ( for short : hba / b stars ) .",
    "our sample consists of the local hb stars which were observed by the hipparcos satellite .",
    "these are the hb - like stars with the most accurate spatial and kinematic data available to date .",
    "however , only for a few hba / b stars are the parallaxes accurate enough to calculate reliable distances ( de boer et  al .",
    "1997b ) . for the other stars",
    "the distance still must be derived from photometry .",
    "here one needs to know the absolute magnitude of field horizontal branch stars . especially since the publication of the hipparcos catalogue a lot of effort has gone into fixing this value .",
    "however , this has not yet led to total agreement . for a review of various approaches to solving this problem",
    "we refer to de boer ( 1999 ) and popowski & gould ( 1999 ) .",
    "an important parameter in these studies is the metallicity of the stars , as it is generally thought to be correlated with age . for dwarf stars metallicities",
    "can be estimated using photometric indices or spectroscopy ( see the summary by majewski 1993 ) . for hb stars",
    "this is , unfortunately , not a trustworthy method .",
    "the atmospheres of many hb stars have most probably been altered chemically with respect to the original composition . gravitational settling of heavy elements in the sdb / o star and possibly hbb",
    "star atmospheres leads to a present lower content of elements like he , while levitation of heavy elements leads to atmospheres with enhanced abundances of certain elements like fe or au as found in several field horizontal branch stars , e.g. feige 86 ( bonifacio et al . 1995 ) .",
    "levitation must also be the explanation for the high metal abundances in blue hb stars in m 13 ( behr et  al .",
    "1999 ) and ngc 6752 ( moehler et  al .",
    "1999 ) finally uncovered to explain deviant flux distributions near the balmer jump of globular cluster blue hb stars ( grundahl et  al .",
    "therefore , original metallicities ( as well as the original masses ) are no longer accessible quantities .",
    "determining the kinematic properties can help deciding which of the hb stars are intrinsically more metal poor and which are more metal rich , and hence of somewhat younger origin .",
    "the main subjects of our study are the hba / b stars which are located in the colour magnitude diagram on the horizontal branch between the rr - lyrae stars and the hot subdwarfs",
    ". unfortunately the main sequence crosses the hb at the hbb region , so that hbb stars can be confused with normal b stars .",
    "therefore we have only few hbb stars in our sample .",
    "we mainly focus on hb stars with temperatures lower than 10000 k which lie above the main sequence .",
    "2 deals with the data neccessary for our study . in sect .",
    "2.3 we determine the absolute magnitudes and distances of the hba / b and sdb / o stars with the method of _ auto - calibration _ using the shape of the hb defined by the stars with the best hipparcos parallaxes . in sect .",
    "3 we discuss the kinematical behaviour of the hba / b and sdb / o stars and make comparisons with the results of de boer et  al .",
    "( 1997a ) . to further explore a possible trend in kinematics of stars along the hb we investigate ( sect .",
    "4 ) the orbits of a sample of rr - lyrae stars .    [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , < , > , > , < \" , ]      +    to determine the parameters @xmath5 , the maximum height reached above the galactic plane and @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the apo- and perigalactic distances , we calculated the orbits over 10 gyr .",
    "this for certain does not give true orbits as the orbits are probably altered in time by heating processes .",
    "however this long timespan allows to better show the area the orbit can occupy in the meridional plane ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .    as in de boer et al . ( 1997a ) , we also calculated the eccentricity @xmath8 of the orbit , given by @xmath9 and the normalised @xmath10-extent , @xmath11 , given by @xmath12 the parameter @xmath11 is more relevant than @xmath5 , since it accounts for the effect of diminished gravitational potential at larger galactocentric distance @xmath13 .    to assign a star to a population",
    "often the @xmath14-velocities and their dispersions are used , as well as the orbital velocity @xmath15 . for stars near the sun ( small @xmath16 )",
    ", the @xmath17 velocity is nearly the same as @xmath15 .",
    "however , for stars further away from the sun s azimuth , @xmath15 becomes a linear combination of @xmath18 and @xmath17",
    ". therefore @xmath15 should be preferred . in order to make comparisons with results from other studies , we use both @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we calculated the errors of the velocity components and the orbital velocity using monte carlo simulations of gaussian distributions to vary the input parameters within their errors as described by odenkirchen ( 1991 ) .",
    "this is neccesary rather than just calculating errors using gauss error propagation laws because the parameters are significantly correlated . for the error calculation we used the software of odenkirchen ( priv .",
    "the proper motion errors were taken from the hipparcos catalogue .",
    "the errors of the distances were calculated from the error in absolute magnitude as derived in sect .",
    "we took the errors of the radial velocities as published in the respective articles .",
    "for those radial velocities of wilson ( 1953 ) and evans ( 1967 ) having quality mark `` e '' , meaning the error is larger than 10 kms@xmath19 , we used 15 kms@xmath19  as error .",
    "this is justified as can be seen by comparison of these values with those of other studies .",
    "generally the error in the velocity components is less than 10 kms@xmath19 .",
    "only a few stars have somewhat larger errors , the largest error in @xmath15 being 12 kms@xmath19 . for the hba / b stars the typical value of @xmath20 is about 7 kms@xmath19 , for the on average closer",
    "sdb / o stars @xmath20 is 1 to 2 kms@xmath19 .",
    "we estimated errors for @xmath11 , @xmath8 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 because they have not been used individually in the interpretation .",
    "moreover the larger values of @xmath11 are very sensitive to small variations in the shape of the orbit .",
    "this especially applies to stars having chaotic orbits .",
    "variations in the input distance modulus showed that the resulting variations in all of these quantities except @xmath11 are relatively small in most cases . for a discussion of overall effects on a sample see de boer et  al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "the orbits of the hba / b stars show a large variety of shapes .",
    "nearly all of the cooler hba stars have a small perigalactic distance ( @xmath23 3 kpc ) and the most extreme case , hd  86986 , reaches a perigalactic distance of only 0.4 kpc .",
    "the single exception is hd 117880 , which has a @xmath22 of nearly 4 kpc .",
    "four stars have truly chaotic orbits , the rest has boxy type orbits , but some of these show signs of chaotic behaviour as well .",
    "hd 79813 has an orbit staying very close to the disc , while hd 117880 orbits nearly perpendicular to the galactic plane . on the whole about half of our stars have orbits which are chaotic or show signs of that .",
    "this agrees quite well with the results of schuster & allen ( 1997 ) who analysed a sample of local halo subdwarfs .",
    "most of the stars have apogalactic distances of @xmath24 8 to 11 kpc , just one star ( hd  86986 ) goes well beyond .",
    "the reason for this clumping in @xmath21 is not physical but due to selection effects .",
    "stars with @xmath25 kpc never venture into the observable zone ( at least observable by hipparcos ) . on the other hand",
    "the probability of finding the stars is greatest when they are near their major turning point , @xmath22 .",
    "so it is clear that the mean @xmath21 , as well as to a lesser extent the eccentricity , are affected by selection effects .",
    "stars belonging to the thin disk would have orbits with very small eccentricities and @xmath11 values ( solar values : @xmath8=  0.09 , @xmath11=  0.001 , see de boer et  al .",
    "1997a ) , while thick disk stars would have larger values on average .",
    "halo stars have generally orbits with large eccentricities while their @xmath11 show a large range .",
    "the eccentricities of the hba star orbits are very large , ranging from 0.5 to nearly 1.0 , the values for @xmath11 vary by a huge amount , from 0.04 ( hd  78913 ) to 5 ( hd  117880 ) . the stars bd  + 36 2242 and feige 86 are exceptions , their values for both parameters are more appropriate for disk objects .",
    "we note that these two stars are the hottest of the hba / b sample .",
    "the kinematics of the four hbb stars from schmidt ( 1996 ) show overall behaviour similar to that of bd  + 36 2242 and feige 86 ( fig .",
    "all of these are hotter than 11000 k , the @xmath26 of bd  + 36  2242 .",
    "the star hd 117880 features an orbit somewhat dissimilar from the others . while its @xmath11 is very high",
    ", its eccentricity is by far the lowest of the sample of hba stars .    # 1#21.0      the hba stars ( @xmath26  @xmath27 10,000",
    "k ) have a mean orbital velocity of @xmath15 = 17 kms@xmath19 , lagging about 200 kms@xmath19  behind the local standard of rest",
    ". however , the velocity dispersions are large : 102 , 53 and 95 kms@xmath19  in @xmath18 , @xmath17 , @xmath28 respectively .",
    "this shows that there are many stars with a non disk - like kinematical behaviour in the sample of hba / b stars .",
    "they therefore belong to the galactic halo population rather than to the disk .",
    "the orbital velocities of the hba stars in the sample do not have a gaussian distribution , as one might have expected .",
    "instead , they seem to have a somewhat flatter distribution ( see fig .",
    "about 75% of our stars have prograde velocities , four stars have retrograde orbits",
    ". however the exact distribution can not be studied reliably due to the limited number of stars at disposal .",
    "both the analysis of the kinematic properties and the shapes of the orbits imply that the hba / b stars mostly are members of the galactic halo population",
    ". however , there seems to be a difference in kinematics and hence population membership between the cooler and the hotter stars .",
    "stars cooler than about 10,000 k have low orbital velocities and a large spread in @xmath11 .",
    "in contrast to this are the hotter stars whose kinematics and orbits are consistent with those of disk objects .",
    "the hbb stars of schmidt ( 1996 ) which are all hotter than 10,000 k behave like sdb stars , too .",
    "the sample of sdb / o stars show classical disk behaviour : their mean orbital velocity is @xmath29 kms@xmath19 , meaning a negligible asymmetric drift .",
    "the @xmath17 velocity dispersion ( which is also the dispersion in @xmath15 , because the stars are in the solar vicinity ) is relatively small , similar to that of old thin disk orbits , while the dispersion in @xmath18 is much larger , fitting to thick disk values .",
    "the dispersion @xmath30 is somewhere in between .",
    "these values are quite similar to those of the sdb star sample of de boer et  al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "until now no population of _ field _ sdb stars with halo kinematics has been found . yet , hot subdwarfs of the horizontal branches of halo globular clusters are , of course , well known ( see e.g. moehler et  al .",
    "1997 ) .      given the results above there seems to be a trend in the kinematics of star types along the blue part of the horizontal branch ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . the sdb / o stars have disklike orbits .",
    "the same probably applies to the hbb stars hotter than about 10,000 k , though the statistics are rather poor for this part of the hb .",
    "in contrast to that stand the cooler hba stars which have much smaller orbital velocities , large orbital eccentricities and large ranges of @xmath11 , thus showing a behaviour fitting more to halo than to disk objects .",
    "this result suggests to analyse the kinematics of the adjoining cooler stars of the hb , the rr lyraes .    #",
    "recently , martin & morrison ( 1998 ) carried out an investigation of the kinematics of rr lyrae stars which is mainly based on the study of layden ( 1994 ) . for our analysis we will use only those stars having hipparcos data .",
    "six hipparcos stars were excluded because they have a proper motion error larger than 5 mas / yr .    the rr lyrae stars present the observational difficulty in that they are variables with both @xmath17 and @xmath31 changing continously . for most of the sample",
    "we were able to take the mean magnitudes from layden ( 1994 ) .",
    "for the remaining stars we derived the intensity - mean magnitudes with help of the formula given by fitch et  al .",
    "( 1966 ) and revised by barnes & hawley ( 1986 ) which is the same method as used by layden ( 1994 ) , using the photometric data of bookmeyer et  al .",
    "the layden photometry was dereddened using the burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) reddening maps .    for later steps in this study",
    "it is necessary to know the mean @xmath31 of the rr lyrae stars . as the colour curves of the stars are quite similar to the brightness curves , with the star being bluest when it is near maximum brightness , we took the same formula as we used to calculate the mean magnitude .",
    "this is not entirely correct but gives @xmath31 close to the actual one . for six stars we did not have the appropiate light curve data ,",
    "so we could not determine the mean @xmath31 for them .",
    "therefore only 26 rr lyraes are shown in fig .",
    "3 .    as the rr - lyrae stars are in most cases fainter and therefore farther away than our hba / b stars they have a rather large @xmath32 . for this reason we used the absolute magnitude derived in sect . 2.3 to calculate the distances for these stars .",
    "we thus have ignored the effects of metallicity on @xmath33 for individual stars . also possible",
    "evolutionary effects on @xmath33 ( see clement & shelton 1999 ) have been ignored , an aspect groenewegen & salaris ( 1999 ) did not consider in their determination of the rr lyrae @xmath33 either .",
    "since we study the orbits of the rr lyrae as a sample these limitations will not affect our conclusions .    for most rr lyrae stars we took the radial velocities from the sources mentioned in sect .",
    "2.5 , supplemented by radial velocities from layden ( 1994 ) .",
    "the metallicities of the rr - lyrae stars were taken from layden ( 1994 ) as far as possible .",
    "a few values come from layden et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and preston ( 1959 ) .",
    "we calculated the orbits for the rr lyrae stars in the same manner as for the hba / b and sdb stars .",
    "the rr - lyrae stars show a spread in kinematical behaviour wider than that of the hba / b stars .",
    "many stars have orbits similar to those of the hba stars , others show disklike orbits with orbital velocities in the vicinity of 200 kms@xmath19 . of the halo rr - lyrae stars many have perigalactic distances smaller than 1 kpc , as we also found for the hba stars .",
    "the rr - lyrae stars have orbital velocities typically spanning the entire range found for disk and halo stars ( see fig .",
    "three members of our sample of rr lyr stars have orbits shaped somewhat different from those of the rest of halo orbits , looking similar to that of hd 117880 .    in fig .",
    "3 we have sorted the rr lyr stars according to their metallicity using different plot symbols . the stars with an [ fe / h]@xmath34 dex have high @xmath15 like disk stars .",
    "the stars with lower metallicities are more evenly distributed in @xmath15 .",
    "there are several stars with disk - like kinematics with a very low metallicity as low as [ fe / h]@xmath35 dex ( see table 4 ) .",
    "the study of the spatial distribution of hb stars involves , unfortunately , several selection effects .",
    "the general aspects have been reviewed by majewski ( 1993 ) and will not be repeated in detail here . yet , for each stellar type discussed in this paper a few comments are in place .",
    "hba stars have in most cases been identified from photometry , notably because of a larger than normal balmer jump .",
    "this larger jump is mostly due to lower metallicity of the stellar atmosphere .",
    "if the atmospheric metallicity is identical to the original one , then the criterion favours intrinsically metal poor stars , which are presumably the older ones . however , also stars starting with a little more mass than the sun and thus of solar composition will become hb stars and , when as old as the sun , by now are solar metallicity hb stars .",
    "if they were of hba type , they would not have been recognized in photometry of the balmer jump .",
    "such stars would be underrepresented in our sample .",
    "the hba stars considered here come from all galactic latitudes , so that selection effects due to galactic latitude are not to be expected .",
    "however stars which have orbits going far away from the disk are always underrepresented , as their fraction of time near the disk ( and hence being observable ) is much smaller than for those which do not go far from the disk .",
    "rr lyraes , being variables , are not prone to such selection effects .",
    "most of them are identified solely by their variability .",
    "metallicity or high velocity are generally not used as criteria for the identification for rr lyrae stars . for a discussion of selection effects due to galactic latitude",
    "we refer to martin & morrison ( 1998 ) , as our sample is a subsample of theirs .",
    "the sdb / o stars were identified in surveys for quasars , e.g. the pg catalogue ( green et  al .",
    "1986 ) or hamburger quasar survey ( hagen et  al .  1995 ) .",
    "this means their blue colour is the criterion , rather than proper motion , radial velocity or metallicity .",
    "therefore we do not expect a selection bias towards metal poor halo stars .",
    "moreover , de boer et  al .",
    "( 1997a ) showed that the sdb / o stars observed now near the sun come from widely differing locations in the milky way .",
    "as these catalogues only map objects which are somewhat away from the galactic plane , they miss the majority of stars with solar type orbits .",
    "sdo stars may be confused with pagb stars descending down the hrd towards the white dwarf regime .",
    "the hbb stars of schmidt ( 1996 ) are also taken from the pg catalogue , so that there should not be noticeable selection effects , either .",
    "however hbb stars and main sequence stars have similar physical properties such as log@xmath36 , so that there may be confusion with the latter .",
    "apart from this the selection effects mentioned for the sdb / o stars apply to the hbb stars , too .",
    "finally , some words concerning the distribution of distances of the different samples are in place .",
    "generally , if one deals with stars having different absolute magnitudes , as in our case when the sdbs are several magnitudes fainter than the hbas , one gets samples with different mean distances .",
    "the intrinsically fainter stars are on average much nearer than the brighter stars , if the two groups have similar apparent magnitudes .",
    "this means that the spatial regions sampled differ depending on the absolute magnitude of the stars .",
    "this would imply that the sdb sample is biased towards disk stars as we do not sample them far enough from the galactic plane where there may be a higher concentration of halo stars than further in .",
    "this is however not the case . as we include some of the results of de boer et al .",
    "( 1997a ) which come from a completely different source , namely mostly from the pg - catalogue ( green et al .",
    "1986 ) dealing with significantly fainter stars , the pg stars actually have on average larger distances than any of our hba stars .",
    "for this reason we do not expect that the difference in kinematics arises from the distribution of the distances in the samples .",
    "the _ sdb stars _ have in general rather disk - like orbits and kinematical properties .",
    "the ones analysed here ( table 4 ) show the same behaviour as those from the large sample of sdb stars investigated previously ( de boer et  al .",
    "1997a ) .",
    "the ( hotter ) _ hbb stars _ behave rather like the sdbs with orbits of disk - like characteristics .",
    "however , such stars are difficult to recognize and our sample is small .",
    "a much larger sample may show a larger variation in kinematics .",
    "the _ hba stars _ have mostly halo orbits ( mean @xmath37  kms@xmath19 ) .",
    "this is very similar to the value at which most other studies concerning metal poor stars in the solar neighbourhood arrive ( see table 2 of kinman 1995 ) .",
    "however , the known sample may be observationally skewed toward stars with low atmospheric metallicity ( large balmer jump ) .",
    "the _ rr - lyrae stars _ have orbits spanning a large range in orbital parameters , too",
    ". however , a trend seems to be present with metallicity .",
    "the metal poor stars have halo orbits similar to those of the hba stars with rather low orbital velocities of less than 100 kms@xmath19 , and large @xmath8 and @xmath11 .",
    "the metal rich stars on the other hand have rather disk - like kinematical characteristics .",
    "a similar distribution of metallicities and orbital velocities was also found in the studies of chen ( 1999 ) and martin & morrison ( 1998 ) .",
    "although there are a few rr lyraes having high orbital velocities ( @xmath38 kms@xmath19 ) and clearly disk - like orbits ( some of which are very metal poor ) , hba stars with such characteristics are not found in our sample . on the other hand",
    "no rr lyraes with [ fe / h]@xmath34 dex with halo - like orbits or kinematics are present .",
    "this means that a high metallicity for a rr lyr star is a good indicator that it is a disk star .",
    "however , a low metallicity does not mean that a star neccessarily belongs to the halo .",
    "since the sdb stars ( and possibly the hbb stars ) have disk - like orbits , these stars must be part of a relatively younger , more metal rich group among the hb stars .",
    "majewski ( 1993 ) uses the expression ` intermediate population ii ' , other authors use the words ` thick ' or ` extended disk ' .",
    "in addition to the disk - nature of their orbits , the vertical distribution is consistent with a scale height of the order of 1 kpc ( villeneuve et  al .",
    "1995 , de boer et  al .",
    "since the amount of metals in their atmospheres may have been altered by diffusion it is not possible to estimate the true age from the metallicity .",
    "the hba stars have really halo orbits .",
    "this must mean they belong to a very old population .",
    "their atmospheric metal content is low indeed , the determinations showing a large scatter per star and from star to star ranging between @xmath39 and @xmath40 dex .",
    "however , metal rich hba stars which are known to exist in star clusters ( see peterson & green 1998 ) , would likely be underrepresented in the sample .",
    "if the halo contains mostly old stars , like globular cluster stars , then the resulting halo hb stars should occupy the hb in ranges related with metallicity as with the globular clusters ( see renzini 1983 ) .",
    "the very metal poor ones ( [ @xmath41 @xmath42 dex ) would be hb stars of hbb and hba nature as well as rr lyrae , the ones of intermediate metallicity ( [ @xmath41 @xmath43 dex ) would be very blue down to sdb like , and the metal rich ones ( [ @xmath41 @xmath44 dex ) would be rhb stars , perhaps including some rr lyrae .",
    "this behaviour may also explain the existence of the two oosterhof groups ( see van albada & baker 1973 or lee et  al .",
    "1990 ) of rr lyrae , since only the very metal poor and the relatively metal rich globular clusters contain rr lyrae .",
    "evolutionary changes of the hb stars may also affect the location on the hb ( sweigart 1987 , clement & shelton 1999 ) .    however , sdb stars with halo kinematics have not been found ( de boer et  al .",
    "instead , they have only disk orbits .",
    "this must mean that the stars which originally formed in the halo had an initial mass , a metallicity and a red giant mass loss such that rr lyrae and hba stars were the end product , and not sdb stars .",
    "as for the rr lyrae stars , they show a wide range in kinematic behaviour , more or less in line with the atmospheric metal content .",
    "the actual metallicity did not bias the identification of these stars , since they are selected based on variability .",
    "one tends to divide the rr lyrae sample into metal poor and metal rich rr lyrae ( see layden 1994 ) .",
    "here we recall that in the hb stars the contents of heavier elements in their atmospheres may be altered ( see sect .",
    "the rr lyrae stars with the continuous upheaval of the pulsation may stimulate mixing so that their atmospheres probably show the true metallicity . thus , for rr lyraes the metallicity may be used as a general population tracer .",
    "the observed range of metallicities would mean that there are old as well as younger rr lyraes .",
    "old rr lyrae must be very metal poor and should have halo orbits .",
    "the majority of the rr lyrae included in our analysis fit these parameters .",
    "there are , however , a substantial number of rr lyr stars in our sample with disk - like kinematics but low metallicities , in several cases as low as @xmath40 dex .",
    "the origin of this group of stars , dubbed the ` metal weak thick disk ' , is still unknown ( see martin & morrison 1998 for a discussion ) .",
    "young ( or younger ) rr lyrae should be relatively metal rich and have disk orbits .",
    "the investigated sample contains such stars .",
    "these objects should have an age , main - sequence mass , metallicity and rgb mass loss such that rr lyrae emerge , i.e. hb stars with a thicker hydrogen shell .",
    "they are , being relatively metal rich , also of slightly different @xmath33 than the metal poor and old ones .",
    "in fact , they are fainter and their distances should be based on the appropriate brightness - metallicity relation .",
    "the dependence is , however , feeble and amounts to just 0.1 mag for 0.5 dex .",
    "we tested how serious ignoring this effect is on the derived orbits by reducing the rr lyr star distances by 10 % .",
    "it does not lead to a change of significance in the histogram of fig.4 .",
    "our orbit studies allow to see a trend in the kinematics of the field hb stars along the horizontal branch .",
    "this appears to give us access to the structure of the milky way and its halo as well as information about possible formation scenarios .",
    "the trends related with age and history could only be found using the kinematics , since it has become clear that the atmospheric metallicity in hb - like stars has no relation to the one of the main sequence progenitor .",
    "the location of the stars on the hb must be a complicated function of age , main - sequence mass , initial metallicity , and mass loss on the rgb . for the hb - like stars of today indications for the age",
    "can be determined from the present kinematic parameters . only detailed models for metallicity dependent stellar evolution from main sequence through the rg phase with mass loss",
    "should , in comparison with the observables of horizontal branch stars , eventually be able to retrieve the true origin of the hb stars ."

    "<S> here we found a mixed kinematical behaviour , which was already known from previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> some rr lyrae stars have disk - like orbits ( most of these being metal rich ) but the majority has halo - like orbits , very similar to those of our hba stars .    </S>",
    "<S> since the atmospheres of most types of hb stars do not reflect original metallicities any more the kinematics is the only aspect left to study the origin and population membership of these stars . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the clear trend found in kinematics of stars along the hb , which is also a sequence in stellar mass , shows that the different kinds of field hb stars arose from stars having different origins in age and , e.g. , metallicity or mass loss rate . </S>"
