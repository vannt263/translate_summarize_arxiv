    "4u 1820@xmath8303 ( hereafter 4u 1820 ) located in the globular cluster ngc 6624 is an ultracompact x - ray binary ( ucxb ) , which is defined by an ultra - short orbital period ( usually less than 1 hour ) . since its first discovery as a bright x - ray source @xcite ,",
    "4u 1820 has been extensively observed with many x - ray telescopes .",
    "its peak - to - peak modulation period @xmath9 s @xcite is generally believed as the orbital period of a white dwarf orbiting a neutron star @xcite .    as the most compact ucxb",
    ", the formation and evolution history of 4u 1820 has been widely studied so far .",
    "considering the high stellar density of globular cluster , @xcite suggested that this system was formed via spiral - in phase of a neutron star into a red giant after their direct collision .",
    "taking common envelope spiral - in into consideration , @xcite calculated an evolutionary sequence from 4u 2127@xmath1012 in m15 to 4u 1820 . in their scenario ,",
    "the binary system was produced via tidal capture between a main - sequence star and a neutron star .",
    "similarly , @xcite proposed that this source originated from an exchange interaction between a neutron star and a primordial binary including two main sequence stars , in which a common envelope evolution phase would subsequently be expected .",
    "although adopting two different formation channels for 4u 1820 @xcite and @xcite agreed that the mass transfer is dominantly driven by gravitational radiation . based on a similar model , @xcite calculated the evolutionary sequence of 4u 1820 , and found that its donor star is a helium white dwarf of mass @xmath11 @xmath12 with a radius within @xmath13 of a completely degenerate configuration .",
    "they also predicted an x - ray luminosity of @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 , and an orbital - period derivation of @xmath17 @xmath18 driven by mass transfer from the white dwarf to the neutron star .",
    "however , @xcite obtained an orbital - period derivative as @xmath19 @xmath18 by ginga observations .",
    "subsequently , @xcite also reported a negative period derivative at a significance of @xmath20 . employing simultaneous rosat / ginga observations , @xcite reported an average orbital - period derivative @xmath21 @xmath18 . based on the further observation by rosat , @xcite obtained @xmath22 @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite also reported a negative derivative of @xmath23 @xmath1 .",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed the 16 yr _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ) data of 4u 1820 , and refined the negative orbital - period derivative to be @xmath24 @xmath18 at a @xmath25 level . obviously , all of the observations confirmed a negative orbital - period derivative for 4u 1820 , which is contrary to the theoretical prediction given by @xcite .",
    "how to explain the difference in the orbital evolution between the binary evolutionary theories and the observations ? to resolve this problem , many authors proposed various scenarios , which can be divided into two categories . in the first one",
    "it is thought that the orbital - period derivative arises from the binary evolution .",
    "considering the secondary is a non - degenerate helium - star of @xmath26 @xmath27 orbiting a @xmath28 @xmath27 neutron star , @xcite calculated the evolution of a compact binary with initial period 37 minutes .",
    "they found that the orbital period could be as low as 11 minutes and a negative period derivative could be attained also .",
    "their calculation indicates that the donor star is a helium - burning star with mass of @xmath29 @xmath27 , which is not expected to exist in old stellar population like globular clusters @xcite . assuming that stars more massive than the turn - off mass could be formed during the close encounter in globular clusters , @xcite restudied the possibility of helium - burning donor star , and obtain a conclusion similar to @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that a circumbinary disk ( cb disk ) around the binary can drive low - mass x - ray binaries to ultra - short periods as short as 6 min .",
    "recently , @xcite investigated an alternative formation channel toward ucxbs with an orbital period of 11 minutes , which evolved from intermediate - mass x - ray binaries driven by magnetic braking of ap / bp stars .",
    "their simulations also indicate a long - term period - decreasing phase .    in the other case , some researchers suggested that the apparent orbital period derivative can be interpreted by an accelerating motion of the binary towards observers .",
    "@xcite argued the acceleration may arise from a third body or the cluster potential .",
    "@xcite explored the possibility of a stellar mass remnant close to 4u 1820 or an intermediate - mass black - hole inside ngc 6624 .",
    "@xcite even suggested that the secular period change was dominated by systematic or random change of position and shape of occulting bulge on the accretion disk rim .",
    "taking the orbital period change as the result of binary evolution , here we suggest that the negative orbital period derivative of 4u 1820 could be produced by a temporary cb disk , which can extract the orbital angular momentum via resonant interaction from the binary system .",
    "our theoretical analysis and numerical simulation indicate that the cb disk mass that can account for the observed orbital - period derivative is approximately @xmath30 @xmath31 .    in the following section",
    ", we present a simple theoretical analysis for the current orbital - period derivative of 4u 1820 , and describe the cb disk model in section 3 . the numerical simulation method and simulated results",
    "are described in detail in section 4 . in section 5 , we present a brief summary and discussion .",
    "considering a binary consisting of a neutron star ( of mass @xmath32 ) and a he white dwarf secondary ( of mass @xmath33 ) in a circular orbit , the orbital angular momentum is @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 is the reduced mass , and @xmath36 is the orbital separation . the spin angular momentum of the donor star is neglected because it is much less than the orbital angular momentum . by a simple logarithmic differentiation of the angular momentum , we have @xmath37    taking the eddington accretion rate @xmath38 into account , the accretion rate of the neutron star is assumed to be @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a constant .",
    "the accretion efficiency of the neutron star is defined as @xmath41 therefore , when @xmath42 , @xmath43 while @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "x - ray observation performed by @xcite reported an x - ray luminosity of @xmath46 @xmath15 @xmath47 , which implies the accretion rate of 4u 1820 @xmath48 @xmath31 @xmath49 .",
    "magnetic braking would turn off for a fully convective star @xcite , hence we consider angular momentum loss due to gravitational radiation and mass loss : @xmath50 where @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are the angular - momentum - loss rate by gravitational radiation , and mass loss , respectively .",
    "the angular - momentum - loss rate by gravitational radiation is given by @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the light velocity , @xmath55 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath56 is the total mass of the binary .",
    "taking @xmath57 @xmath31 @xcite , @xmath58 @xmath31 @xcite and @xmath59 @xmath60 @xcite , we can derive @xmath61 @xmath49 .",
    "the angular - momentum - loss rate by mass loss can be written as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the specific angular momentum of the ejected matter in units of @xmath64 . in this work , the mass loss during the accretion is assumed to form an isotropic wind in the vicinity of the neutron star , and carry away its specific orbital - angular momentum , i.e. @xmath65 .",
    "based on some parameters mentioned above , one can find @xmath66 @xmath49 .",
    "comparing with gravitational radiation , the angular - momentum loss due to mass loss can be ignored .",
    "based on some parameters mentioned above , equation ( 1 ) can yield the current orbital period derivative of 4u 1820 . for a conservative mass transfer ,",
    "the current period derivative should be @xmath67 @xmath1 , while @xmath68 @xmath1 for nonconservative mass transfer with @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "similar to the discussion given by @xcite , both cases predict a positive orbital period derivative , which is contradicted with the observation .",
    "to interpret the negative orbital - period derivative observed in 4u 1820 , here we propose an evolutionary cb disk model .",
    "the influence of cb disk on the evolution of cataclysmic variables @xcite , black - hole x - ray binaries @xcite , algol binaries @xcite , and ucxbs @xcite have been studied extensively .",
    "all these works show that cb disk can efficiently extract the orbital angular momentum from the binary system , and enhance the mass transfer rate and accelerate the evolution process . in this work",
    ", we adopt a different cb disk model .",
    "the resonant interaction between the binary and the cb disk has been well studied @xcite , and its predicted orbital angular momentum loss rate is given by @xcite : @xmath70 here @xmath71 is the mass of cb disk , @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , and @xmath76 are the inner and outer radius of the cb disk , respectively ) are the thickness and the half angular momentum radius of the disk , respectively . @xmath77 and @xmath78 are integers describing the binary potential , @xmath79 is the viscosity parameter of the disk .",
    "@xcite studied the tidal truncation between circumstellar and cb disks in binaries , and found the inner radius of cb disc is @xmath80 .",
    "following their study , assuming the disk extends from @xmath81 to @xmath82 , the half angular momentum radius of the disk is @xmath83 . according to the study of @xcite , the relative thickness of cb disk near the inner edge is @xmath84 . assuming the disk is thin and the non - axisymmetric potential perturbations are small we take @xmath85 and @xmath86 in this work .",
    "according to above equations a cb disk with mass of @xmath87 @xmath31 can reproduce the observed negative orbital - period derivative for both conservative and the nonconservative mass transfer cases .",
    "certainly , the cb disk would slowly induce a small eccentricity @xcite .",
    "however , the tidal interaction between the donor star with a relatively deep convective envelope and the neutron star in such a compact orbit would rapidly circularize the orbit .",
    "we propose the material of the cb disk comes from some _ rare _ superburst events .",
    "superbursts are hour - long thermonuclear runaway burning processes which were first observed by @xcite from the neutron star low mass x - ray binary 4u 1735@xmath8444 .",
    "a superburst of 4u 1820 was discovered by @xcite and @xcite as the second superburst event ever observed .",
    "subsequently , many other superburst events have been discovered from other lmxbs such as ks 1731@xmath8260 , serpens x@xmath81 gx 3@xmath101 and so on . at present ,",
    "about one dozen superburst sources ( candidates ) have been reported , and one third of these sources were observed recurrently @xcite .",
    "interestingly , although the recurrence times estimated from observation of other sources are on the order of a year @xcite , the second superburst of 4u1820 was observed to be 11 years after the first event @xcite , which is consistent to the prediction ( @xmath88 ) by @xcite .",
    "compared with more frequent type i bursts with short duration ( typically @xmath89 s ) , superbursts release x - ray energy @xmath90 @xmath15 during an event , which is three orders of magnitude higher than that of type i burst . considering a substantial fraction of the released energy during the event",
    "is carried away by neutrinos , and is conducted to the inner part of the neutron star , the total energy released during the event is much larger @xmath91 @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "observational and theoretical studies indicate that it is a thermonuclear runaway burning process , and the energy source is most likely carbon and/or oxygen on the surface of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis indicated the mass of the burning - carbon layer is probably @xmath92 @xmath93 @xcite .    in principle",
    ", there exist a range for the released energy of different superburst events @xcite . here",
    "we assume that some peculiar superburst events ( with a probability of @xmath94 , hereafter rare superbursts ) in a layer of @xmath95 @xmath93 ( @xmath96 @xmath31 ) may be responsible for the formation and evolution of cb disk . in our calculation",
    ", 20 percent of the burning - carbon layer was assumed to escape from the neutron - star surface , and 10 percent of the ejected material ( 2 percent of total burning mass , i.e. @xmath97 @xmath31 ) suddenly feed the cb disk during every rare - superburst event . take the recurrence time of superburst events of 4u1820 is 10 yr , as a result , the cb disk would experience a mass feed with @xmath98 every @xmath99",
    ". meanwhile , the mass of cb disk is assumed to decrease at a rate @xmath100 ( the cb disk only remains @xmath101 at the beginning of next rare superburst ) due to the photo - evaporation of the neutron star s spin - down energy @xcite . according to equation ( 5 ) , the angular - momentum loss due to sudden mass loss from the neutron - star surface induced by ( normal or rare ) superburst is @xmath102 @xmath49 , and can be ignorable .",
    "to evaluate the cb disk scenario in detail , we develop a fast binary - evolution program for 4u 1820 . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , our calculation starts from gravitational wave emission dominated detached binary consisting of a neutron star and a low - mass he white dwarf . to fit the current mass of the neutron star ( @xmath103 @xmath31 , @xcite ) and the donor star ( @xmath104 @xmath31 , @xcite ) , the initial input parameters is set to @xmath105 @xmath31 , @xmath106 @xmath27 , and orbital period @xmath107 hr .",
    "such an orbital - period can ensure a he white dwarf to decouple from its roche lobe and the steady mass transfer condition is not introduced manually but satisfied via slowly adjust of gravitational wave emission .",
    "this is different from @xcite where the evolution was studied from roche lobe filled binary with simple relation between the mass of white dwarf donor and the orbital period : @xmath108 .    once the donor star overflows its roche lobe due to gravitation radiation , it would transfer material to the neutron star at a rate @xcite : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a constant factor . in calculation , we take @xmath111 .",
    "@xmath112 is the radius of the secondary , and @xmath113 is the roche - lobe radius of the donor star .",
    "the function @xmath114 only relate to the mass ratio @xmath115 . in this paper",
    "we adopt the approximately description given by @xcite , i.e. @xmath116 utilizing a simple polytropic index @xmath117 , the donor - star radius is given by @xcite @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the mass abundance of hydrogen ( @xmath120 for a pure helium white dwarf in this paper ) , and @xmath121 ( @xmath122 in this paper ) is the radius ratio between the donor star and the white dwarf with same mass , which is completely degenerate and only supported by the fermi pressure of the electrons .    to test the influence of input parameters on the evolution and compare the results with other works",
    ", we have run four different models as follows :    * model 1:@xmath123 , @xmath124 ; * model 2:@xmath123 , @xmath125 @xmath31 ; * model 3:@xmath69 , @xmath124 ; * model 4:@xmath69 , @xmath125 @xmath31 ;    fig .",
    "2 shows the evolution of an ucxb under different models in the @xmath126 plane .",
    "it is clear that the orbital - period evolution can be divided into two stages . in the first stage",
    ", gravitational radiation dominates the angular momentum loss of the binary , and causes the orbit to sharply shrink .",
    "after the donor star overflows its roche lobe , the orbital decay becomes slower because the material is transferred from the less massive donor star to the more massive accretor .",
    "subsequently , the orbital period gradually increases , and the second stage starts where the evolution roughly obeys an orbital period - donor mass relation as @xmath108 .",
    "our simulation also shows that at the orbital period of @xmath127 min the donor star mass is in the range of @xmath128 , in good agreement with the predication by @xcite . the cb disk formed by the first rare superburst",
    "is assumed to experience a mass feed if the mass - transfer rate @xmath129 .",
    "it seems that four models have a similar evolutionary tracks .",
    "however , in the mini panel of fig .",
    "2 , models 2 and 4 predict short - term orbital - decay episodes , which were induced by sudden mass feed of the cb disk .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "mass transfer from the less massive donor star to the more massive accretor always induces an expanding orbit . in the case of stable mass transfer ,",
    "the orbital - period derivative is proportional to the mass - transfer rate and the rate of angular - momentum loss @xcite .",
    "therefore , the negative orbital - period derivative of 4u 1820 remains mysterious for a white - dwarf binary . in this work",
    ", we propose a cb disk scenario with a cycle - mass feed to interpret the anomalous orbital - period derivative of this source . in our model ,",
    "the runaway burning process during a superburst event may carry away the material of burning layer .",
    "if a small fraction of the material feeds a cb disk around the binary rather than leaves it , the related abrupt change in the total angular - momentum - loss rate destroy the condition for a stable mass transfer , and induce the observed negative orbital - period derivative during the recovery of the stable mass transfer .",
    "although the mass of the burning - carbon layer on the neutron - star surface is only @xmath130 @xmath12 during normal superburst events , we assume that some rare superbursts with a probability of 0.1% have a burning - layer mass of @xmath131 @xmath12 . in calculation ,",
    "rare superbursts are assumed to reoccurrence events with a cycle period of 10,000 yr , and 2 percent of the burning - layer mass feed into a cb disk around the binary . in principle",
    ", photo - evaporation process by the neutron star s spin - down energy would decrease the mass of the cb disk @xcite .",
    "however , the mass - loss rate of the cb disk sensitively depends on the photo - evaporation efficiency , the binary separation , and the spin period of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "therefore , we simply assume that the cb disk lost 0.1% of its current mass every year .",
    "our numerical calculation show that such a cb disk model can account for the donor - star mass , orbital period , and orbital - period derivative observed in 4u 1820 .",
    "if the rare superburst events have a recurrence time of 10,000 yr , the cb disk model predicts a 900 yr timescale in the period - decreasing stage , and gives a probability of @xmath132 to observe a negative period derivative . certainly , because of the recovery of stable mass transfer , the absolute value of orbital - period derivative should slowly decrease which can be tested by future further observations . in addition , because the continuum contribution of dust emission from the cb disk could observed in l band ( @xmath133 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect future detailed multi - waveband observations for 4u 1820 to confirm or refute our scenario ."
