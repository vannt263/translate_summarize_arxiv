    "the history of taylor - couette flow dates back to the 19th century . to measure viscosity",
    ", @xcite studied flows between rotating concentric cylinders .",
    "rayleigh s stability criterion was introduced in 1916 during his study of cyclones .",
    "@xcite extended it by including viscosity , and made quantitative predictions of instability in couette flow .",
    "if the cylinders were infinitely long , the steady - state laminar solution would be the ideal taylor - couette state : @xmath1 in which @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the radius of the inner and outer cylinder , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the angular velocity of the inner and outer cylinder respectively . rayleigh s stability criterion states that in the unmagnetized and inviscid limit , such a flow is linearly axisymmetrically stable if and only if the specific angular momentum increases outwards : @xmath8 .",
    "the study of magnetized taylor - couette flow began much later . @xcite and @xcite discovered that a vertical magnetic field may destabilize the flow , provided that the angular _ velocity _ decreases outward , @xmath9 , which today is called magnetorotational instability ( mri ) . in ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , the instability takes place with an arbitrarily weak field @xcite .",
    "experiments on magnetized couette flow aiming to observe mri have been performed @xcite , but mri has never been conclusively demonstrated in the laboratory .",
    "some other experiments have been proposed or are still under construction @xcite .",
    "the experimental geometry planned by most groups is a magnetized taylor - couette flow : an incompressible liquid metal with density @xmath10 , kinematic viscosity @xmath11 and magnetic resistivity @xmath12 confined between concentric rotating cylinders , with an imposed axial and/or toroidal background magnetic field sustained by currents external to the fluid .",
    "the challenge for experimentation is that liquid - metal flows are very far from ideal on laboratory scales .",
    "while the fluid reynolds number @xmath13 can be large , the corresponding _ magnetic _ reynolds number @xmath14 is modest or small , because the magnetic prandtl number @xmath15 in liquid metals .",
    "standard mri modes will not grow unless both the rotation period and the alfvn crossing time are shorter than the timescale for magnetic diffusion .",
    "this requires both @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the lundquist number , in which @xmath19 is the alfvn speed and @xmath20 is the imposed axial magnetic field .",
    "therefore , @xmath21 and fields of several kilogauss must typically be achieved .",
    "hollerbach and collaborators have discovered that mri - like modes may grow at much reduced @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the presence of a helical background field , a current - free combination of axial and toroidal field @xcite .",
    "though @xcite have claimed to observe this helical mri ( hmri ) experimentally , we explained the experimentally measured wave patterns to be transiently amplified disturbances launched by viscous boundary layers rather than globally unstable modes @xcite .",
    "we also questioned the relevance of this helical mri to astrophysics by showing that this new mode is stable for a keplerian rotation profile by wkb analysis in a narrow - gap geometry ( see sec.ii.a of @xcite ) and by linear calculations in a wide - gap geometry ( see sec.ii.b of @xcite ) .",
    "recently @xcite have reported that this new mode is unstable in the inductionless limit with for some boundary conditions . under the parameters used in the @xcite ( @xmath24 , but with finite @xmath25 and hartmann number @xmath26 )",
    ", the authors are indeed taking the diffusivity to infinity @xmath27 .",
    "note however that the combination @xmath28 , which is the elsasser number @xmath29 @xcite , is also finite .",
    "the authors consider @xmath30 and @xmath25 to be constant as @xmath31 ; thus if we think of @xmath32 and @xmath11 as fixed , then the alfven speed must scale like @xmath33 as @xmath27 .",
    "so , the authors are considering a limit in which the alfven speed is infinitely larger than the rotation speed but poorly coupled to the flow , whereas @xcite were thinking of the resistive limit as one in which the field strength and rotation speed were held fixed as the diffusivity became infinite .",
    "the former limit is unlikely to be important in astrophysics .",
    "however , it might be achieved in a low - plasma - beta but highly resistive ( weakly ionized ) plasma .    in view of the large reynolds number",
    ", the taylor - proudman theorem suggests that the end plates should dominate the entire flow unless a very long cylinder were used ( @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the height of the cylinders . )",
    "the no - slip boundary condition on the end plates causes an imbalance between centrifugal and pressure forces and drives ekman circulation .",
    "if the endcaps rotate rigidly with the outer cylinder , this circulation takes the form of inward flows along the endcaps , which turn vertically along the inner cylinder , converge at the midplane , and depart the cylinder in a radial jet @xcite . this ekman circulation , and especially the jet , transport angular momentum efficiently and",
    "reduce the free energy available for shear - driven instabilities @xcite .",
    "both effects are unfavorable for laboratory demonstration of mri .",
    "the princeton mri experimental apparatus has been constructed to minimize the circulation by the use of independently controlled split endcaps @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the jump of the rotation speed at the junction of the rings extends some distance into the bulk as a _ stewartson layer _",
    "@xcite , however , the modification of the stewartson layer by the axial magnetic field has to be studied .",
    "there has been research done on the mhd ekman layers ( or ekman - hartmann layers as they are sometimes called in the literatures ) @xcite .",
    "however there has been little work aside from @xcite concerning the effect of finite differential rotation on ekman layers , or on magnetized stewartson layers in cylindrical geometry @xcite ( @xcite did excellent work on magnetized stewartson layers , though in spherical geometry ) .",
    "the latter issues remain poorly understood but play a big role in mri experiments @xcite and have potential importance in geophysics and fluid dynamics . @xcite",
    "discussed the purely hydrodynamic ( unmagnetized ) steady results with the assumption of infinitesimal differential rotation , or a very tiny rossby number , while our paper discusses time - dependent solutions with finite differential rotation .",
    "@xcite presented results with finite differential rotation but without rings ( similar to sec .",
    "iii of our paper ) , thus no stewartson layer is present .",
    "that paper is a good contribution to potsdam rossendorf magnetic instability experiment ( promise ) and the discussion of taylor - dean flow is very insightful .",
    "this paper is one of the first to study magnetized stewartson layers in cylindrical geometry .",
    "understanding the role of the boundary layers , especially magnetized ones , is critical to the success of mri experiments .",
    "it is known that ekman circulation is significantly modified when the elsasser number @xcite exceeds unity : @xmath36 where @xmath32 is the characteristic rotation frequency , which we take equal to @xmath7 . for gallium , @xmath37 . adopting the parameters used in the princeton mri experiment ( table.[ta_parameter ] ) , @xmath38 ,",
    "@xmath39 , immediately leads to @xmath40 . in the promise experiment @xcite , @xmath41 .",
    "hence magnetic modifications to the ekman layer should be significant in both experiments .    here",
    "we report nonlinear simulations with the _",
    "zeus-2d _ code @xcite , which is a time - explicit , compressible , astrophysical ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) two - dimensional code , to which we have added viscosity and resistivity ( with subcycling to reduce the cost of the induction equation ) for axisymmetric flows in cylindrical coordinates @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the simulation domain mimics the princeton mri experiment ( see table  [ ta_parameter ] and fig .  [ ekman_scheme ] ) except where stated explicitly .",
    "the code adopts the magnetic boundary conditions introduced in sec .",
    "ii.d of @xcite ( not the commonly used vertically pseudo - vacuum boundary conditions ) .",
    "all real flows are actually compressible ; in an ideal gas of fixed total volume , density changes generally scale @xmath43 when mach number @xmath44 .",
    "incompressibility is an idealization in the limit @xmath45 .",
    "an isothermal equation of state has been used with a sound speed chosen so that the maximum of @xmath46 .",
    "the techniques used here have been benchmarked analytically and compared with other codes in @xcite and verified experimentally in @xcite .",
    "note that in the simulations the magnetic diffusivity @xmath12 is fixed to the experimental value @xmath47 ( table.[ta_parameter ] ) , however the kinematic viscosity is varied for the purpose of extrapolation .",
    "also as demonstrated by @xcite , the viscosity of liquid metals is so small as to be almost irrelevant to mri , at least in the linear regime .    in this present work ,",
    "since we concentrate on magnetic ekman and stewartson layers , the rotation speed profile is chosen so that the system is mri stable .",

    "<S> in this paper we present axisymmetric nonlinear simulations of magnetized ekman and stewartson layers in a magnetized taylor - couette flow with a centrifugally stable angular - momemtum profile and with a magnetic reynolds number below the threshold of magnetorotational instability . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field is found to inhibit the ekman suction . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the ekman layer is reduced with increased magnetic field normal to the end plate . a uniformly - rotating region forms near the outer cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> a strong magnetic field leads to a steady stewartson layer emanating from the junction between differentially rotating rings at the endcaps . the stewartson layer becomes thinner with larger reynolds number and penetrates deeper into the bulk flow with stronger magnetic field and larger reynolds number . </S>",
    "<S> however , at reynolds number larger than a critical value @xmath0 , axisymmetric , and perhaps also nonaxisymmetric , instabilities occur and result in a less prominent stewartson layer that extends less far from the boundary . </S>"
