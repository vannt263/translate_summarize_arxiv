    "this paper is a new and much shortened version of the preprint @xcite.as well known , the isotopy problem for closed braids in the solid torus reduces to the conjugacy problem in braid groups ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the latter problem is solved , but in general only with exponential complexity with respect to the braid lenght ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to construct invariants which distinguish conjugacy classes of braids and which are calculable with polynomial complexity .",
    "finite type invariants for knots in the solid torus are an example of such invariants ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    "we construct another class of calculable invariants.we give now a brief outline of our approach : let @xmath5 be a closed braid ( i.e. the restriction of @xmath2 to @xmath6 has no critical points ) and such that @xmath6 is a knot .",
    "we fix a projection @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 be the infinite dimensional ) space of all closed braids which are isotopic to @xmath6 in v. @xmath8 has a natural stratification .",
    "the strata @xmath9 of codimension 1 are just the braid diagrams which have in the projection @xmath10 either exactly one ordinary triple point or exactly one ordinary autotangency.we call the corresponding strata @xmath11 and respectively @xmath12 .",
    "first , we associate to a closed braid in a canonical way a loop in @xmath8 , called the _ canonical loop _ and denoted @xmath13.next , we associate to the canonical loop an oriented singular link in a thickened torus .",
    "this link is called the _ trace graph _ and it is denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "all singularities of @xmath14 are ordinary triple points .",
    "these triple points correspond exactly to the intersections of @xmath13 with @xmath15}(tri)$ ] . there is a natural coorientation on @xmath11 and ,",
    "hence , each triple point in @xmath14 has a sign .",
    "to each triple point corresponds a knot diagram which has just ordinary crossings and exactly one triple crossing .",
    "we use the position of the ordinary crossings with respect to the triple crossing in the _ gauss diagram _ in order to construct _ weights _ for the triple points .",
    "we associate to the loop @xmath13 then _ weighted intersection numbers _ with @xmath11 .",
    "these intersection numbers turn out to be finite type invariants .",
    "we call them _ one - cocycle invariants _ .as all finite type invariants the one - cocycle invariants have a natural degree .",
    "however , they are rather special finite type invariants , as shows the following proposition .",
    "let @xmath6 be a closed n - braid which is a knot and let c be the word lenght of @xmath16 ( with respect to the standard generators of @xmath17 ) .",
    "then all one - cocycle invariants of degree d vanish for @xmath6 if @xmath18 .",
    "one has to compare this proposition with the following well known fact : the trefoil has non - trivial finite type invariants of arbitrary high degree .",
    "consequently , the one - cocycle invariants define a natural filtered subspace in the filtered space of all finite type invariants for those knots in the solid torus , which are closed braids .",
    "there is a very simple procedure , coming from singularity theory , in order to construct all one - cocycle invariants for closed braids , without solving a big system of equations .",
    "they verify automatically the marked 4t - relations ( compare @xcite and also @xcite ) .",
    "however , the one - cocycle invariants can be refined considerably .",
    "when we deform @xmath6 in v by a generic isotopy then @xmath13 in @xmath8 deforms by a generic homotopy .",
    "the following lemma is our key observation .",
    "the loop @xmath13 is never tangential to @xmath12 .",
    "it follows from this lemma that the connected components of the natural resolution of @xmath14 ( i.e. the abstract union of circles where the branches in the triple points are separated ) are isotopy invariants of @xmath19 . we apply now our theory of one - cocycle invariants but only to those triple points in @xmath14 where three _ given _ components of @xmath14 intersect .",
    "the resulting invariants are called _",
    "character invariants _ .",
    "they are no longer of finite type but they are still calculable with polynomial complexity with respect to the braid lenght .    the set of finite type invariants ( in particular , the set of one - cocycle invariants ) can be seen as a trivial local system on @xmath8 .",
    "in contrast to this , the set of character invariants is in general a non - trivial local system on @xmath8 .",
    "alexander stoimenow has written a computer program in order to calculate character invariants .",
    "it turns out that already character invariants of linear complexity can sometimes detect non - invertibility of closed braids ( i.e. the closed braid together with the axis of the complementary solid torus in @xmath20 is a non - invertible link in @xmath20 ) .",
    "this implies in particular that character invariants are in general not of finite type .",
    "we observe that the most simple character invariants are still well defined for almost closed braids .    .",
    "the basic notions of our one parameter approach to knot theory , namely the space of non - singular knots , its discriminant , the stratification of the discriminant , the coorientation of strata of low codimension , the canonical loop , the trace graph , the equivalence relation for trace graphs , are worked out in all details in our joint work with vitaliy kurlin @xcite .",
    "therefore we concentrate in this paper only on the construction of the new invariants .    _",
