    "considering the problem of the escaping radiation from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , one has to note that we have a strong observational evidence of a complex picture of emission spectra , which starts from the radio , the optical up to @xmath0-ray and @xmath1-ray , with the bolometric luminosity power of agns lying in the range : @xmath2erg / s$ ] ( see ref . 1 ) .",
    "origin of emission is supposed to be energy of an accreted matter and a spinning black hole , however , the details of the conversion process of this energy into electromagnetic radiation is still unknown . the discovery of blazars ( see ref .",
    "2 ) as sources of ultra - high energy radiation , has revealed that the formation and acceleration of relativistic jets are key processes in understanding the energy conversion mechanism .",
    "an innermost region of agns is characterized by rotational motion , and it is obvious that the rotation affects acceleration of plasmas in jets , which consequently may influence a process of radiation . the problem of a role of centrifugal acceleration ( ca ) as the rotational effect , on a theoretical level has been studied in ref . 3 for the schwarzschild black hole and it has been found that under certain conditions the centrifugal force may change its direction from centrifugal to centripetal .",
    "the same effect was shown in ref .",
    "4 where authors studied dynamics of particles , sliding along rotating straight channels .",
    "it has been argued that due to the centrifugal force , the process of acceleration might be very efficient for rotation energy extraction . on the other hand",
    "it is obvious that no physical system can preserve rigid rotation nearby the light cylinder surface ( lcs ) ( an area where the linear velocity of rotation is equal to the speed of light ) where magnetic field lines must deviate from the straight configuration .",
    "generalization of ref .",
    "4 for curved field lines has been presented in ref . 5 and it was found that for the archimedes spiral a centrifugal outflow may reach infinity , avoiding the light cylinder problem . according to the spin paradigm ( stating that , to first order , it is the normalized black hole angular momentum , that determines whether or not a strong radio jet is produced ) ( see ref .",
    "6 ) rotation is supposed to be fundamental in formation of outflows .",
    "blandford & payne ( see ref",
    ". 7 ) considering the problem of creation of the outflows , pointed out that in this process the centrifugal acceleration may play an important role depending on the inclination angle of magnetic field lines .",
    "a series of works dedicated to effects of rotation , examine its role in the nonthermal emission .",
    "one of the important examples from this point of view is the work of blandford & znajek ( see ref .",
    "8) , where they show that the rotational energy of the black hole can be extracted electromagnetically as a poynting flux . in the context of agn , gangadhara & lesch",
    "( see ref .",
    "9 ) considered the problem for understanding how efficient the rotation is for producing @xmath0 - ray and @xmath1 - ray photons .",
    "it was shown that nearby the light cylinder surface , centrifugally accelerated particles , due to scattering against low energetic photons , may provide the mentioned radiation .",
    "reconsidering the same problem for explaining the tev energy emission from a certain class of blazars , in ref .",
    "10 it has been argued that the ca might be so strong , that could provide ultra - relativistic electrons .",
    "all mentioned cases exhibit the possibility of energy pumping from rotation and in cases of the centrifugal acceleration they show its high efficiency in the energetics of relativistic electrons in rotating plasmas accelerating up to energies corresponding to the lorentz factors of the order of @xmath3 ( see ref .",
    "thus , the amount of energy contained within a centrifugally accelerated plasma flow is very big and if there are mechanisms for the conversion of at least a small fraction of this energy into the the variety of instabilities - one might find a number of interesting consequences related to the problem of plasma energy conversion into radiation .",
    "generally speaking , for the energy pumping process , one has three fundamental stages : ( a ) energy conversion from rotation into kinetic energy of the plasma background flow , ( b ) kinetic energy conversion into energy of electrostatic waves and ( c ) conversion of the energy of waves into radiation by means of the process of the inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of electrostatic waves to photons @xmath4 , which is thought to be responsible for creation of nonthermal radiation ( see ref .",
    "11 ) . by tautz & lerche ( see ref .",
    "12 ) the electrostatic / electromagnetic mixed mode has been considered for relativistic jets in the context of gamma - ray bursts , to determine low - frequency instabilities .",
    "but our aim is to consider only electrostatic waves and investigate the second stage of the process [ see ( b ) ] and show how efficient it is",
    ". therefore the electrostatic wave , playing an important role in the process of radiation might be very effective if one makes it unstable and as we will see the centrifugal force may be very sufficient in this context .",
    "the centrifugally driven parametric instability has been introduced in ref .",
    "13 where it was shown that the centrifugal force acting on particles inside the pulsar magnetospheres , causes separation of charges , leading to generation of an electrostatic field , which excites the corresponding instability .",
    "the increment of the linear stage has been estimated and analyzed for the crab pulsar and it turned out that the linear regime was extremely efficient and short in time , indicating a need of saturation of a growth rate .",
    "this mechanism is called parametric , because an `` external '' force - the centrifugal force , playing a role of the parameter , acts on plasma particles , changes in time and gives rise to the instability . by applying the same approach , in ref .",

    "the problem of the reconstruction of the pulsar magnetospheres on large scales nearby the lcs has been considered .",
    "we have studied a new parametric mechanism and it was shown that for curvature drift waves , corresponding instability might be extremely efficient .    in this paper a hydrodynamic approach will be used to study the parametric mechanism of rotation induced electrostatic wave generation in extragalactic jets , applying the approach developed in ref . 13 and ref .",

    "an interesting feature of the result shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is sensitiveness of the growth rate on the wave length .",
    "as it is clear from the plot , a small change of @xmath72 , drastically changes the situation : for certain values of the wave length the increment reaches its maximum level and for slightly different values - it becomes equal to @xmath87 .",
    "therefore it is better to examine an average value for each interval with a single peak , taking into account both parameters : @xmath72 and @xmath5 , calculate the growth rate with respect to them :    @xmath88    and based on discrete data interpolate it for a wider range of parameters . here",
    "@xmath89 and @xmath90 are minimum and maximum values of the wave length and the angle respectively for each interval .    in spite of that jets usually have small opening angles ,",
    "it is better to study a dependence of the growth rate on inclination for a wider range of angles , in order to understand a general behaviour of the increment . in fig .",

    ", the increment is a continuously increasing function .",
    "this is a natural result , because when one increases the angle , the effective angular velocity increases as well , that makes the centrifugal force higher , leading to the more efficient instability process .",

    "as we see from the present figure , the instability is less efficient for smaller angles .",

    "let us consider a less efficient case , thus the smallest increment ( for @xmath91 ) shown in the figure : @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) , and see how powerful the instability is .",
    "one can easily estimate the corresponding time scale by inversing the value of @xmath96 : @xmath97    on the other hand jets are formed due to an accreting matter , therefore energetics of jets is defined by the efficiency of the accretion process , and in order to understand how efficient the considered instability is , one has to estimate the evolution time scale of an accreting disk and compare it with the instability time scale .    in ref .",
    "19 the problem of fueling of agns is considered and it is shown that for a given mass and luminosity of the agn , mass of the self gravitating disk can be expressed by :    @xmath98 @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the standard shakura , sunyaev viscosity parameter ( see ref .",

    "[ fig4 ] . for producing the plot",

    "this means that the linear stage has to be short in time , and the growth rate must saturate soon due to non linear effects , consideration of which seems to be essential .    in the introduction we have noticed that the langmuir waves may strongly influence processes of radiation through the ics of these waves against soft photons , when due to the channel @xmath120 the electrostatic waves lose energy , whereas the photons gain energy .",

    "5 .   taking into account efficiency of an accretion process in agns , and comparing the corresponding time scale to the time scale of the electrostatic instability",
    "it has been found that even when the latter is less effective ( small angles and wave lengths ) the instability process is extremely efficient .",
    "+ the electrostatic instability may strongly affect processes of radiation in agn jets by means of the ics , therefore for extending this work , it is natural to consider a next important step and study the last stage : energy conversion into radiation .",
    "+ an important restriction in the present model is that we studied the problem for quasi - straight magnetic field lines , whereas in real astrophysical situations the field lines are curved and it is interesting to see what changes in the dynamics of the electrostatic wave instability , when the curvature is taken into account",
    ". + on the other hand the curvature of magnetic field lines induces the curvature drift waves , which also may affect the process of energy pumping . in the context of pulsars this problem has been considered in ref .",

    "it is reasonable to examine the same problem for relativistic agn jets and study the role of the curvature drift modes in the energy conversion process .",
    "+ when studying the problem on the linear stage , the increment shows high efficiency of the electrostatic instability , therefore the non linear regime also has to be examined in order to study the problem for longer time scales when the linear approximation does not work any more . for this purpose",
