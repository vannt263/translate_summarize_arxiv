    "this critical behavior , where fluctuations are large , is associated with the fact that entanglement should be present at all length - scales .",

    "even more clear is this crossing of eigenvalue pairs in the right plot of fig.@xmath2[fig6 ] to finally collapse near @xmath176 where the transition @xmath58-@xmath79 is now crossed .",
    "the information encoded in the crossings is related to changes in the number of bosons in well 2 and , as a consequence , a change in the fock states participating in the ground state .",
    "we have shown that mesoscopic samples of polarized dipolar atoms confined in three spatially separated traps realize different quantum phases depending on the dipole orientation . using for their description an extended dipolar bose - hubbard hamiltonian , the competition set by the anisotropy of the inter - site dipole - dipole interaction , together with on - site interaction strongly determines the possible phases of the ground states .",
    "we have solved the dbh hamiltonian by means of exact diagonalization for different number of bosons , and shown in which cases the ground state is compatible with a mean field description . to this aim",
    "we have further analyzed the properties of each phase by means of their entanglement properties , going beyond averaged quantities like the von neumann entropy to discuss and distinguish the differences between phase boundaries and crossovers in these setups .",
    "the former are accompanied by a flat band distribution of all schmidt coefficients while the latter are shown as a crossover between different schmidt coefficients without full degeneracy .",
    "a more detailed study on the scaling behavior of the entanglement in these systems , allowing for the determination of critical quantities and exponents is beyond the scope of the present work and will be presented in the future @xcite .",
