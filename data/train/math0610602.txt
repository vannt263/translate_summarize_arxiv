    "at the end of the 19th century , poincar addressed the problem of evolution and stability of the solar system , which led to many surprising questions and gave birth to the modern theory of dynamical systems as a qualitative study of the dynamics .",
    "the main goal of this theory is the description of the _ typical behavior _ of orbits , and the understanding of how this behavior changes when we perturb the system or to which extent it is robust . in the present work",
    "we are specially concerned with the problem of the _ stability _ of systems .",
    "the first fundamental concept of robustness , _ structural stability _ , was formulated in the late 30 s by andronov and pontryagin .",
    "it requires the persistence of the orbit topological structure under small perturbations , expressed in terms of the existence of a homeomorphism sending orbits of the initial system onto orbits of the perturbed one .",
    "this concept is tied with the notion of _ uniform hyperbolicity _ introduced by smale in the mid 60 s .",
    "a stronger connection was conjectured by palis and smale in 1970 : a diffeomorphism is structurally stable if and only if it is uniformly hyperbolic and satisfies the so - called transversality condition . during this decade",
    "the `` if '' part of the conjecture was solved due to the contributions of robbin , de melo and robinson ; in the 80 s ma settled the @xmath0-stability conjecture .",
    "the flow case was solved by aoki and hayashi , independently , in the 90 s , also in the @xmath0-topology .    in spite of these astonishing successes , structural stability proved to be somewhat restrictive .",
    "several important models , such as lorenz flows , hnon maps and other non - uniformly hyperbolic systems fail to present structural stability , although some key aspects of a statistical nature persist after small perturbations .",
    "the contributions of kolmogorov , sinai , ruelle , bowen , oseledets , pesin , katok , ma and many others turned the attention of the study of dynamical systems from a topological perspective to a more statistical approach , and ergodic theory experienced an unprecedent development . in trying to capture this statistical persistence of phenomena ,",
    "alves and viana @xcite proposed the notion of _ statistical stability _ , which expresses the continuous variation of physical measures as a function of the evolution law governing the systems .",
    "a _ physical measure _ for a smooth map @xmath1 on a manifold @xmath2 is a borel probability measure @xmath3 on @xmath2 for which there is a positive lebesgue measure set of points @xmath4 , whose union forms the _ basin _ of  @xmath3 , such that @xmath5 for any continuous function @xmath6 .",
    "physical measures are intimately connected with _",
    "sinai - ruelle - bowen measures _",
    "( srb for short ) .",
    "an @xmath7-invariant borel probability measure @xmath3 is said to be srb if it has a positive lyapunov exponent and the conditional measures of @xmath3 on unstable leaves are absolutely continuous with respect to the riemannian measure induced on those leaves ; see section  [ subsec : srb - measures ] for a precise definition .",
    "the existence of srb measures for general dynamical systems is usually a difficult problem . however , sinai , ruelle and bowen established the existence of srb measures for axiom a attractors which qualify as physical measures .",
    "moreover , axiom a diffeomorphisms are statistically stable .",
    "the existence of srb measures for a large set of one - dimensional quadratic maps exhibiting non - uniformly expanding behavior has been established in the pioneer paper of jakobson @xcite . additionally , the work of collet - eckmann @xcite and benedicks - carleson @xcite became a major breakthrough in that direction and allowed a well succeeded approach to higher dimensional maps .",
    "a key ingredient is the exponential growth of the derivative along the critical orbit for a positive lebesgue measure set @xmath8 of parameters .",
    "regarding statistical stability , freitas @xcite showed that the srb measures vary continuously within the parameter set @xmath8 ; see also @xcite and @xcite where tsujii , rychlik and sorets obtained related results .",
    "notice that , by the work of thunberg @xcite , one can not expect statistical stability on a full lebesgue measure set of parameters for the quadratic family .",
    "hnon @xcite proposed the two - parameter family of maps @xmath9{ccc } \\r^2 & \\longrightarrow & \\r^2\\\\ ( x , y ) & \\longmapsto & ( 1-ax^2+y , bx ) \\end{array}\\ ] ] as a model for non - linear two - dimensional dynamical systems , which can be thought as a simplified discrete version of the lorenz flow .",
    "based on numerical experiments for the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 , hnon conjectured that this dynamical system should have a _",
    "strange attractor_. in principle , most initial points could be attracted to a periodic cycle , so it was not at all _ a priori _ clear that the attractor detected by hnon in his experiments was not a long stable periodic orbit .",
    "however , benedicks and carleson @xcite managed to prove that hnon s conjecture was true for small @xmath12 , showing that for a positive lebesgue measure set @xmath13 the map @xmath14 with @xmath15 exhibits a _",
    "non - hyperbolic attractor_. afterwards , benedicks and young @xcite proved that each of these non - hyperbolic attractors supports a unique srb measure @xmath16 , which is also a physical measure and whose main statistical features were studied by benedicks , viana and young in @xcite .",
    "thus , a natural question is : are the hnon maps of the benedicks - carleson type statistically stable ?",
    "the main result of this work gives a positive answer to this question .",
    "the map which associates to each @xmath17 the srb measure @xmath18 is continuous with respect to the weak * topology in the space of probability measures .    despite being metrically robust , the strange attractors appearing for the benedicks - carleson parameters are very fragile .",
    "in fact , ures @xcite showed that the benedicks - carleson parameters can be approximated by other parameters for which the hnon map has a homoclinic tangency associated to a fixed point . hence , according to newhouse s results @xcite , one may deduce the appearance of infinitely many attractors in the neighborhood of the hnon attractor .",
    "moreover , ures @xcite proved that the srb measures @xmath16 corresponding to @xmath15 can be approximated by dirac measures supported on sinks .",
    "nevertheless , benedicks and viana @xcite showed that the hnon maps in @xmath13 are _ stochastically stable_. this notion was introduced by kolmogorov and sinai in the 70 s and in broad terms asserts that time - averages of continuous functions are only slightly affected when iteration by the dynamics is perturbed by a small random noise .",
    "stochastic stability may imply statistical stability if we allow a deterministic noise .",
    "however , the proof of the stochastic stability in @xcite uses strongly the absolute continuity of the random noise , which prevents us to deduce the statistical stability from the stochastic one .",
    "we consider a sequence of parameters @xmath19 converging to @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the respective srb measures .",
    "our goal is to show that @xmath23 converges to @xmath22 in the weak * topology .",
    "we prove this by showing that every subsequence @xmath24 contains a subsequence convergent to @xmath22 .",
    "let us give some details on how to find this convergent subsequence .",
    "the main problem we have to overcome is the need of comparing measures supported on different attractors .",
    "our strategy is to look for a common ground where the construction of the srb measure for every parameter is rooted .",
    "to do so , we start by noting that each of these maps admits a horseshoe @xmath25 with infinitely many branches and variable return times ( we will drop the indices when we refer to properties that apply to all these objects ) obtained by intersecting two transversal families of local stable and unstable curves . besides , @xmath26 intersects each local unstable curve in a positive lebesgue measure cantor set , and for each @xmath27 it is possible to assign a positive integer @xmath28 defining the return time function @xmath29 which indicates that @xmath30 returns to @xmath26 after @xmath28 iterates .",
    "the hyperbolic properties of @xmath26 and the good behavior of @xmath31 allow us to build a markov extension that organizes the dynamics of these hnon maps .",
    "thus , one needs to show first that for nearby parameters the corresponding horseshoes are also close .",
    "we remark that for each parameter there is not a unique horseshoe with the required properties .",
    "therefore , what we can establish is that for a given parameter @xmath32 and a chosen horseshoe @xmath25 , if we consider a small perturbation @xmath33 , then it is possible to build a horseshoe @xmath34 with the desired hyperbolic properties and which is close to @xmath25 .    these horseshoes play an important role in a construction of the srb measures that suits our purposes .",
    "actually , @xmath35 preserves a measure @xmath36 with absolutely continuous conditional measures on local unstable curves with respect to the lebesgue measure on each curve ; the good behavior of the function @xmath31 ensures that the saturation of @xmath36 is an srb measure , and by uniqueness it follows that the saturation of @xmath36 is the srb measure . to prove the continuous dependence of these srb measures on the parameter , @xmath26",
    "is collapsed along stable curves yielding a quotient space @xmath37 , which can be thought inside a fixed local unstable curve @xmath38 , and whose elements are represented by the intersection of the corresponding stable curve with @xmath38 .",
    "this way our task is reduced to analyze @xmath39 .",
    "this map is piecewise uniformly expanding and its perron - frobenius operator has a spectral gap under the usual aperiodicity conditions ; so there is an @xmath40-invariant density with respect to lebesgue measure on  @xmath38 .",
    "as @xmath41 is nearly horizontal , we can think of @xmath42 as a function defined on a subset of the @xmath43-axis .",
    "the advantage of this perspective is that it gives us the desired common domain for these densities , providing the first step in the verification of the continuity .",
    "therefore , the steps for the construction of the convergent subsequence are the following :    * fix a parameter @xmath20 and a respective horseshoe @xmath44 . *",
    "pick any sequence of parameters @xmath45 such that @xmath46 as @xmath47 and consider @xmath48 for all @xmath49 . *",
    "construct for every @xmath50 an horseshoe @xmath51 adequate to @xmath52 and such that it gets closer to @xmath44 as @xmath47 .",
    "* collapse @xmath51 and consider the @xmath53-invariant densities @xmath54 . realize them as functions defined on an interval of the @xmath43-axis and belonging to a closed disk of @xmath55 .",
    "apply banach - alaoglu theorem to derive a convergent subsequence @xmath56 . *",
    "employ a technique used by bowen in @xcite to lift the @xmath40-invariant measure from the quotient space @xmath37 to an @xmath57-invariant measure on the horseshoe @xmath26 . this way we obtain measures @xmath58 and @xmath59 , defined on @xmath60 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "* verify that all the measures @xmath58 and @xmath59 desintegrate into conditional absolutely continuous measures on unstable leaves .",
    "* saturate the measures @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "these saturations are @xmath61-invariant and @xmath62-invariant , respectively , and have absolutely continuous conditional measures on unstable leaves .",
    "the uniqueness of the srb measures ensures that the saturation of @xmath58 is @xmath63 ( the @xmath61-invariant srb measure ) and that of @xmath64 is @xmath22 ( the @xmath62-invariant srb measure ) . * finally ,",
    "show that this construction yields @xmath65 in the weak * topology .",
    "in this section we provide information regarding the dynamical properties of the hnon maps @xmath66 , corresponding to the benedicks - carleson parameters @xmath15 .",
    "we do not intend to give an exhaustive description but rather a brief summary of the most relevant features whose main ideas are scattered through the papers @xcite .",
    "we recommend the summary in @xcite and chapter 4 of @xcite where the reader can find a comprehensive description of the techniques and results regarding hnon - like maps , including a revision of the referred papers ; both texts inspired our summary .",
    "the survey @xcite provides a deep discussion about the exclusion of parameters which are the basis of benedicks - carleson results . concerning the 1-dimensional case we also refer the paper @xcite in which a description of the benedicks - carleson techniques in the phase space setting can be found .      the pioneer work of jakobson @xcite establishing the existence of a positive lebesgue measure set of parameters where the logistic family presents chaotic behavior paved the way for a better understanding of the dynamics beyond the non - hyperbolic case .",
    "the analysis of the hnon maps made by benedicks and carleson , triggered by the work of collet - eckmann @xcite and benedicks - carleson @xcite themselves , was a major breakthrough in that direction .",
    "a key idea is the exponential growth of the derivative along the critical orbit , introduced in @xcite . in their remarkable paper @xcite , benedicks and carleson",
    "manage to establish , in a very creative fashion , a parallelism between the estimates for the 1-dimensional quadratic maps and the hnon maps .",
    "this connection supports the use of 1-dimensional language in the present paper and compels us to remind the results in section 2 of @xcite .",
    "in there , it is proved the existence of a positive lebesgue measure set of parameters , say @xmath8 , within the family @xmath67\\rightarrow[-1,1]$ ] , given by @xmath68 verifying    1 .   [",
