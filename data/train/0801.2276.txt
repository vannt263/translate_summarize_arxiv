    "their existence was established at microscale reynolds numbers @xmath1 , by seeding a turbulent liquid with gas bubbles and thereby visualizing regions of low pressure that are associated with vorticity @xcite .    at low reynolds numbers , @xmath2 , direct numerical simulations derived basic parameters of vortex tubes .",

    "a direct numerical simulation is not easy for now .",

    "however , this and other past studies focused on intense vortex tubes that are easily captured by imposing a threshold on the velocity variation . for all vortex tubes with various intensities , the tube parameters have not been known .",
    "now we try to study vortex tubes as a whole .",
    "the present study is based on data of our past experiments described in @xcite . since wide ranges of the reynolds number @xmath16",
    "were obtained in two configurations for turbulence production , i.e. , boundary layer and duct flow , we are able to study dependence of tube parameters on the reynolds number and on the large - scale flow . since the data were long , @xmath17@xmath18 points , their statistics are expected to be significant .",

    "this is because , although the @xmath42 profiles for vortex tubes should be antisymmetric , a symmetric positive excursion is induced by the contamination with the @xmath43 velocity that is perpendicular to the @xmath26 and @xmath10 velocities @xcite .",

    "each quantity was normalized by its value in the duct flow at @xmath48 ( d5 ) .",
    "that is , we avoid the prefactors that are not equal to the true values (  [ s4 ] ) .",
    "we instead focus on scaling laws .",
    "the radius @xmath12 scales with the kolmogorov length @xmath3 as @xmath14 ( fig . [ f4]a ) .",
    "this is partly because vortex tubes were identified on a scale @xmath49 (  [ s4 ] ) , but the scatter of @xmath50 is less than the scatter of @xmath51 as in table [ t2 ] .",
    "the maximum circulation velocity @xmath13 scales with the kolmogorov velocity @xmath5 as @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "[ f4]b ) rather than with the rms velocity fluctuation @xmath35 as @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ f4]c ) , if we consider the entire @xmath16 range .",
    "this result is reasonable because @xmath5 is a characteristic of small - scale motions . at @xmath53 ,",
    "the scaling @xmath15 is also significant .",
    "since @xmath15 is observed for intense vortex tubes (  [ s6 ] ) , @xmath15 is also observed for all vortex tubes if the mean @xmath10 profile is biased toward intense vortex tubes .",
    "this is more likely at higher @xmath16 because @xmath54 .",
    "however , since intense vortex tubes are rare (  [ s6 ] ) , @xmath15 does not represent vortex tubes as a whole .",
    "we do not consider the scaling @xmath15 .",
    "direct numerical simulations of homogeneous isotropic turbulence and turbulent channel flows at @xmath2 derived the scalings @xmath14 and @xmath52 for all vortex tubes @xcite . we have found that , regardless of the configuration for turbulence production , those scalings extend at least up to @xmath55 .",
    "the scalings of the radius @xmath12 and circulation velocity @xmath13 lead to a scaling of the reynolds number @xmath56 that characterizes stability of vortex tubes @xcite :    [ eq2 ] @xmath57    if we consider the entire @xmath16 range , our result favors the former scaling ( fig .",
    "[ f4]d ) rather than the latter ( fig .",
    "this is in accordance with the observed scalings of @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( figs .",
    "[ f4]a and [ f4]b ) .",
    "the constancy of @xmath58 implies that vortex tubes as a whole are stable against an increase of the reynolds number @xmath16 . at @xmath53 ,",
    "the scaling @xmath59 is also significant .",
    "this scaling is not important to us because it is related with @xmath15 discussed before ( fig .",
    "the present result for all vortex tubes with various intensities is compared with a past result for intense vortex tubes alone .",
    "we use the result of @xcite , which was based on the same experimental data . for a similar experimental result for intense vortex tubes , see @xcite .    to identify intense vortex tubes",
    ", @xcite imposed a threshold on the absolute velocity increment @xmath60 .",
    "the threshold was such that 0.1% or 1% of the increments were used for the identification .",
    "these increments are included in the increments used for all vortex tubes as shown in fig .",
    "thus , intense vortex tubes studied by @xcite are included in all vortex tubes studied here .",
    "@xcite estimated the radius @xmath12 and maximum circulation velocity @xmath13 from mean velocity profiles .",
    "they were obtained by averaging signals centered at individual positions where @xmath60 was above the threshold .",
    "since the mean velocity profiles were dominated by vortex tubes with @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the @xmath12 and @xmath13 values are close to the true mean radius and true mean circulation velocity (  [ s3 ] ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath12 and @xmath13 on the threshold was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the radius for intense vortex tubes , @xmath637 @xcite , is less than that for all vortex tubes , @xmath649 ( table [ t2 ] ) . while the former is close to the true mean radius , the latter is greater than the true mean radius (  [ s4 ] ) .",
    "the true mean radius appears not to be significantly different between intense and all vortex tubes . both of them obey the scaling @xmath14 .",
    "the circulation flows of vortex tubes are always of smallest scales of turbulence .",
    "the circulation velocity for intense vortex tubes , @xmath650.8 @xcite , is greater than that for all vortex tubes , @xmath660.3 ( table [ t2 ] ) .",
    "this is mainly due to the difference in the true mean circulation velocity .",
    "in addition , the @xmath13 value for all vortex tubes is less than the true mean circulation velocity (  [ s4 ] ) .",
    "while all vortex tubes obey the scaling @xmath52 , intense vortex tubes obey the scaling @xmath15 in the same @xmath16 range .",
    "the reynolds number for intense vortex tubes scales as @xmath59 , which is explained through equation ( [ eq2b ] ) by the scalings @xmath14 and @xmath67 . with an increase of @xmath16 , intense vortex tubes progressively have higher @xmath58 and are more unstable",
    "the situation is different in the case of all vortex tubes , for which @xmath58 is constant .    direct numerical simulations at @xmath2 derived @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and",
    "hence @xmath59 for intense vortex tubes @xcite while @xmath14 , @xmath52 , and hence @xmath68 for all vortex tubes @xcite .",
    "this difference in the scalings of @xmath13 and @xmath58 is the same as that obtained here up to @xmath55 .",
    "the difference in the scalings of @xmath13 and @xmath58 between intense and all vortex tubes implies that their roles are different .",
    "since @xmath67 , intense vortex tubes are responsible for small - scale intermittency .",
    "this is especially the case at high @xmath16 because @xmath54 .",
    "in fact , at high @xmath16 , small - scale intermittency is significant .",
    "however , since @xmath59 , intense vortex tubes have short lifetimes and thus rare at high @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , vortex tubes as a whole obey the scalings @xmath52 and @xmath68 .",
    "they are always ubiquitous and responsible for an important fraction of energy at smallest scales .",
    "using velocity data obtained in boundary layers at @xmath01304 and duct flows at @xmath111934 @xcite , we have studied vortex tubes , i.e. , the elementary structures of turbulence . while past experimental studies focused on intense vortex tubes , the present study focuses on all vortex tubes with various intensities .",
    "we have obtained the mean velocity profile , estimated the radius @xmath12 and maximum circulation velocity @xmath13 , and then obtained the scalings @xmath14 , @xmath52 , and @xmath69 .",
    "they are in contrast to the scalings for intense vortex tubes alone , i.e. , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath59 . since those scalings for all vortex tubes are independent of the configuration for turbulence production , they appear to be universal at high reynolds numbers @xmath16 .",
    "the implication of the scalings is that vortex tubes as a whole are always ubiquitous and responsible for an important fraction of energy at smallest scales .",
    "the present study has some ambiguities because only one - dimensional data of the velocity field are available . to proceed further , two- or three - dimensional velocity data are necessary but are not available for now .",
    "the advent of array of hot - wire probes @xcite or particle image velocimeter @xcite that is applicable to vortex tubes at high reynolds numbers is desirable .",
