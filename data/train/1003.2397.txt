    "] these two technical capabilities allow detection of point sources with as few as @xmath0 observed x - ray photons ( commonly referred to as `` events '' or `` counts '' ) , a data analysis regime unique among x - ray observatories .",
    "observations of galactic star clusters and mosaics of nearby galaxies or extragalactic deep fields often produce hundreds to thousands of weak x - ray sources .",
    "_ chandra _ s excellent sensitivity to point sources and angular resolution also provide a unique capability for studying diffuse emission superposed onto those point sources , since they can be effectively identified and then masked .    for many types of acis  `` imaging '' studies ,",

    "a common workflow for studying point sources ( solid boxes and arrows on left side of figure  [ workflow.fig ] ) consists of binning the l2 event data into one or more images that are searched for sources .",
    "the events and background associated with each point source in the catalog are `` extracted '' and calibrated . observed sources properties ( e.g. , count rates , apparent fluxes , spectra , light curves ) are estimated , then combined with calibration products to estimate intrinsic astrophysical source properties . a common and similar workflow for studying diffuse emission ( right side of figure  [ workflow.fig ] ) consists of removing ( `` masking '' ) the point sources from the data , constructing images , identifying several regions of diffuse emission to study , and then extracting and analyzing those diffuse sources in a manner similar to that used for point sources .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    many _ chandra _  studies exhibit one or more of five characteristics that significantly complicate this familiar workflow .    1 .   in many studies hundreds to thousands of point sources can be readily identified ; executing the workflow is intractable without significant automation .",
    "numerous sources with very few detected counts are identified in most _ chandra _  studies ; common statistical methods based on large - n assumptions break down at several points in the workflow .",
    "many studies require covering a large field of view with multiple _ chandra _  pointings ( e.g. , figure  [ emap.fig ] ) . for many reasons ,",
    "such mosaicked pointings usually overlap significantly and/or are observed at a variety of roll angles .",
    "thus , many sources are observed multiple times at very different locations on the acis  detector . analysis of such sources can be very complex , because the _ chandra _  point spread function ( psf ) exhibits large variations in size and shape across the focal plane .",
    "( http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/hrma/users_guide/ ) .",
    "] analysis of diffuse emission is also complicated by multiple pointings , since a single diffuse region may be only partially covered by a particular acis  observation .",
    "4 .   some fields ( such as deep exposures of rich star clusters , the galactic center , or nearby galaxies ) are crowded , with adjacent psfs in close proximity . in such conditions , simple approaches to source extraction and background estimation are not adequate .",
    "5 .   scientifically relevant diffuse emission must often be extracted and studied while avoiding contamination from point sources ( e.g. , in star forming regions , the galactic center , and galaxy clusters in deep fields ) .    ) in preparation for extraction of diffuse emission (  [ diffuse.sec ] ) .",
    "all point sources are masked in the individual , high - resolution , exposure maps ; at this scale only the larger masks ( on mostly off - axis sources ) are visible .",
    "[ emap.fig],scaledwidth=80.0% ]    since our _ chandra _  studies often exhibit all five of these issues , we have developed a set of data analysis methods that incorporate a variety of enhancements to standard techniques .",

    "we acknowledge that urls are more ephemeral than journal citations but we believe that they are better than no documentation at all .",
    "the high - level structure of our data analysis workflow differs from standard practice in two ways .",
    "first , for technical reasons , the optimal data cleaning steps for point sources and diffuse sources differ for acis  data (  [ l1_l2.sec ] ) ; thus figure  [ workflow.fig ] shows separate `` cleaning '' operations on those two branches of the analysis .",
    "second , since the point source extraction process generates estimates of source position (  [ src_positions.sec ] ) and source validity (  [ signif.sec ] ) that are expected to be better than the estimates made by typical source detection procedures , we choose to adopt an iterative workflow (  [ iterative_detection.sec ] and dashed boxes and lines in figure  [ workflow.fig ] ) in which the point source detection process merely nominates candidates that are then repositioned and possibly discarded as likely noise peaks after extraction results are in hand .",
    "most of this paper describes the individual data analysis tasks implied by figure  [ workflow.fig ] , emphasizing the changes to standard methods that we have adopted .",

    "+    the lowest instrumental background level can be obtained by applying    these two cleaning procedures and the aggressive afterglow detection    procedure .",
    "this aggressive cleaning scheme is preferred when searching    for weak point sources and when studying diffuse emission , but is not    appropriate when extracting bright sources because the number , spatial    distribution , and spectral distribution of events mistakenly removed    by these algorithms ( false positives ) near bright sources is not well    known .",
    "+    thus , we recommend the bifurcated data reduction workflow shown in    figure  [ workflow.fig ] .",
    "an aggressively cleaned l2 event list is used    to detect point sources and to extract diffuse sources , whereas point    sources are extracted from an l2 event list that has been only mildly    cleaned .",
    "this strategy is not ideal because point source extractions    will occasionally contain some detectable afterglow events    contaminating the actual x - ray events that produced the detection .",
    "we    mitigate this problem by checking each extracted source for residual    afterglow events and flagging sources dominated by afterglows .",
    "appendix  [ spare_bit.sec ] shows one method for applying both afterglow    detection tools and for then performing either the gentle or    aggressive cleaning criteria discussed above .",
    "recipes and software    implementing this l1-to - l2 processing are available upon request .",
    "typically , the process of source detection is a distinct precursor to source extraction and analysis .",
    "source detection algorithms must estimate some sort of significance for a putative source s signal with respect to the background expected to contaminate that signal .",
    "in other words , source detection algorithms must perform some type of extraction of a proposed source , estimate the local background , and compute some type of significance statistic from those two quantities .",
    "much of this paper describes the algorithms we have developed to perform those same three tasks  extraction (  [ extraction.sec ] ) , background estimation (  [ bkg_extract.sec ] ) , and characterizing source significance([src_prop.sec])on complex acis  campaigns involving multiple misaligned observations of crowded fields of point sources .",
    "we expect these careful algorithms to produce higher quality results for point sources than can possibly be produced by typical source detection schemes that operate on binned images , do not have knowledge of the _ chandra _  psf , and are not designed for multiple misaligned observations .    thus , we have adopted and we recommend a source detection strategy that combines the convenience and efficiency of traditional source detection tools with the accuracy achieved only by detailed extraction and analysis of an entire catalog .",
    "first , a liberal catalog of candidate point sources is obtained from a variety of traditional source detection methods , run with aggressive thresholds that seek to find weak sources but are expected to produce significant numbers of spurious detections .",

    "this iterative pruning procedure , depicted in figure  [ workflow.fig ] as a loop through the steps `` ps catalog , '' `` ps extraction , '' and `` prune / reposition sources , '' is necessary because construction of both source apertures (  [ extract_reg.sec ] ) and background regions (  [ bkg_extract.sec ] ) in crowded fields can be more appropriately performed when the existence of neighboring sources is taken into account .",
    "in contrast , typical detection algorithms estimate background for a putative source using the nearby pixels in an image , without explicit regard for possible contamination by nearby sources .",

    "observers must be aware that fainter undetected point sources may be present in some fields ; interpretation of diffuse emission should consider this corruption by undetected point sources .",
    "diffuse analysis proceeds with smoothing the resulting source - free image , defining regions that contain diffuse structures of interest , and extracting the x - ray data from those regions .      as described in  [ bkg_extract.sec ] and figure  [ emap.fig ] , _ ae _  provides two methods for constructing mask regions that remove point source photons that would contaminate an analysis of diffuse emission .",
    "the remaining event distribution , consisting of instrumental background and possible astrophysical diffuse emission , is often best studied in smoothed images .",
    "although the _ ciao _  task _ csmooth _ @xcite is effective and popular for smoothing unmasked data that contain both point sources and diffuse emission , it is poorly suited to working with images that contain unobserved regions , either masked point sources or regions beyond the edges of the detector , because the tool does not allow a field mask to be supplied .",

    "all the events in the source aperture are background  they show that the joint probability of finding at least the observed number of events in the source aperture and finding the observed number of events in the background region can be found by integrating a binomial distribution . this calculation can be performed with the following call to the _ binomial _ function in _ idl _ : @xmath74 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the number of counts observed in the source aperture and background region in a specified energy band .",
    "the source aperture and background region `` areas , '' @xmath32 and @xmath33 , are discussed in  [ bkg_extract.sec ] .",
    "this derivation takes into account both the uncertainty of estimating the background level ( i.e. , the poisson nature of @xmath35 ) and the uncertainty of the events observed within the source aperture ( i.e. , the poisson nature of @xmath34 ) .",
    "thus , the significance of a given source extraction will tend to decrease ( @xmath12 will rise ) if its background region is reduced in size because fewer background counts ( @xmath35 ) will be detected ( regardless of whether the background surface brightness inferred from @xmath35 increases or decreases ) .",
    "this behavior can be intuitively rephrased as `` weak sources benefit more than strong sources from accurate estimates of the background . '' _ ae _",
    "sizes background regions so that poisson uncertainty on the background contributes no more than 3% of the total uncertainty on the source photometry .",

    "<S> as members of the instrument team for the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on nasa s _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and as _ chandra _  general observers , we have developed a wide variety of data analysis methods that we believe are useful to the _ chandra _  community , and have constructed a significant body of publicly - available software ( the _ acis extract _ package ) addressing important acis  data and science analysis tasks . </S>",
    "<S> this paper seeks to describe these data analysis methods for two purposes : to document the data analysis work performed in our own science projects , and to help other acis  observers judge whether these methods may be useful in their own projects ( regardless of what tools and procedures they choose to implement those methods ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the acis  data analysis recommendations we offer here address much of the workflow in a typical acis  project , including data preparation , point source detection via both wavelet decomposition and image reconstruction , masking point sources , identification of diffuse structures , event extraction for both point and diffuse sources , merging extractions from multiple observations , nonparametric broad - band photometry , analysis of low - count spectra , and automation of these tasks . </S>",
    "<S> many of the innovations presented here arise from several , often interwoven , complications that are found in many _ </S>",
    "<S> chandra _  projects : large numbers of point sources ( hundreds to several thousand ) , faint point sources , misaligned multiple observations of an astronomical field , point source crowding , and scientifically relevant diffuse emission . </S>"
