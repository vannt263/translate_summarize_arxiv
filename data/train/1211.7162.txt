    "recent developments in understanding the initial geometry in heavy ion collisions points to a lumpy initial state  @xcite .",
    "event - by - event fluctuations break the symmetry of the initial density profile , and as a result there is , in general , one direction where the profile is steepest .",
    "this effect can be quantified as a dipole asymmetry in the initial density  @xcite ,    @xmath1    where @xmath2 corresponds to the steepest direction of the density profile in polar coordinate system @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the magnitude of the dipole asymmetry .",
    "this can be measured in heavy ion collision experiment as a first harmonic coefficient in the azimuthal distribution of the particles with respect to the @xmath2 plane  @xcite .",
    "this signal associated with dipole asymmetry is symmetric with respect to pseudorapidity ( @xmath5 ) , where as the conventional directed flow , also the first flow harmonic ( @xmath6 ) , originated from the bounce off motion of the nucleons is an odd function of pseudorapidity  @xcite . to measure this signal",
    "we need to correct for the effect of momentum conservation and suppress rapidity odd directed flow .",
    "about ten million au + au collisions at @xmath0 gev have been used in this study , all acquired in the year 2004 using the star detector with a minimum - bias trigger . the time projection chamber ( tpc ) of star covers covers pseudorapidity @xmath7 and has been used as a main tracking detector for this experiment .",
    "the centrality definition of an event is based on the number of charged tracks in the tpc within @xmath8 . in this analysis",
    ", events are required to have vertex @xmath9 coordinate ( along the beam direction ) within 30 cm from the center of the tpc .",
    "as proposed by luzum and ollitrault  @xcite , we used the modified event vector method to measure this signal .",
    "the event plane vector is reconstructed from tracks with transverse momentum ( @xmath10 ) up to 2 gev/@xmath11 and within @xmath12 .",
    "the event plane vectors are defined by  @xcite , @xmath13 @xmath14 where weight is taken as    @xmath15    r0.50        the @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent event averaged quantities .",
    "the choice of this weight corrects the effect of the momentum conservation and also it cancels out the conventional pseudorapidity asymmetric directed flow  @xcite .",
    "we used scalar product method as well as the event plane method to measure the signal . in the scalar product method ,",
    "the particles with @xmath18 were assigned to one subevent and particles with @xmath19 to the other subevent , separated by @xmath5 gap of 1.0 units between two subevents and at least 0.5 unit with the particle of interest and the subevent to which it is correlated . in order to remove the acceptance effects we applied recentering correction  @xcite to the flow vectors . with unit vector defined as @xmath20 ,",
    "the first harmonic coefficient @xmath6 is evaluated as ,    @xmath21    @xmath22    in the event plane method , the particles with @xmath23 were assigned to one subevent and particles with @xmath24 to the other subevent , so that subevents were separated by @xmath5 gap of 0.2 units .",
    "larger pseudorapidity separation was desired but we are limited by the event plane resolution . in this method , we first evaluate the event plane angle @xmath25 from the event plane vector ( @xmath26 ) as ,    @xmath27    the event plane angle was flattened using a shifting correction method to correct for the detector acceptance effects .",
    "the particle correlation with event plane angle @xmath25 is given by ,    @xmath28    @xmath29",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] presents the first flow harmonic associated with dipole asymmetry for au+au collisions as a function of pseudorapidity(@xmath5 ) in 0 - 5% through 40 - 50% central collisions in @xmath30 gev/@xmath11 .",
    "results are presented from event plane method and scalar product method .",
    "results from both methods are consistent with each other within statistical errors .",
    "it was expected that very little @xmath5 dependence would be found  @xcite , which is true for central collisions .",
    "however in more peripheral collisions it is observed that the signal has some @xmath5 dependence .",
    "this small @xmath5 dependence may be a viscous effect and/or may be coming from non flow correlation which increases from central to peripheral collisions .",
    "this effect may also come from imperfect cancelation of odd component of @xmath6 .",
    "we are not aware of any model results studying this effect , and future theoretical studies may shed light on it .",
    "r0.50        in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the @xmath6 signal along with @xmath31 and @xmath32 as a function of transverse momentum up to @xmath10 @xmath33 5 gev/@xmath11 is shown for central ( 0 - 10% ) and mid central ( 30 - 40% ) collisions . the magnitude of @xmath34 signal at intermediate transverse momentum ( @xmath35 gev/@xmath11 ) is comparable to the elliptic flow signal and triangular flow in central collisions ( 0 - 10% ) and smaller than @xmath31 but larger than @xmath32 in mid central collisions ( 30 - 40% ) collisions .",
    "results form the atlas collaboration at @xmath36 tev pb+pb collisions also show similar trend  @xcite , however the measurement technique is slightly different .",
    "they used two - particle correlation data and employed a two - component fit ansatz to separate the pseudorapidity - even first harmonic coefficient from the signal due to momentum conservation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the first harmonic coefficient as a function of transverse momentum in 0 - 10% , 10 - 20% , 20 - 30% , 30 - 40% and 40 - 50% central collisions are compared to the viscous hydrodynamic model prediction with fluctuating initial conditions from monte carlo glauber  @xcite and small viscosity setting(@xmath37 ) of reference  @xcite .",
    "these model predictions do a very good job in describing the data at low transverse momentum and in central collisions and they deviate at higher @xmath10 in more peripheral collisions .",
    "results in the figures above are presented with only statistical errors . in these studies ,",
    "contribution from short range correlation such as bose - einstein correlations , coulomb interactions are studied using a pseudorapidity gap of at least 0.5 units in pseudorapidity between the event vector and the particle of interest using scalar product method .",
    "comparison to event plane method with smaller pseudorapidity gap suggests that non - flow contribution from short range correlations are small . to reduce the effects from high @xmath10 particles in the estimation of the event plane",
    ", we used @xmath10 weight only up to 2 gev/@xmath11 . the non - flow contribution from the jets / minijets",
    "is not known and might be a significant contributor to the systematic uncertainties especially at peripheral collisions .",
    "in summary , we present first measurements of directed flow associated with dipole asymmetry from au + au collisions at @xmath0 gev from star collaboration at rhic . we report result from the scalar product method as well as standard event plane method . the results from both methods are consistent with each other .",
    "the signal is symmetric with respect to pseudorapidity unlike conventional directed flow which is anti - symmetric with respect to pseudorapidity . at intermediate @xmath10 range 3 - 5",
    "gev/@xmath11 , this signal is comparable to the elliptic flow signal in central collisions and triangular flow at central and mid central collisions .",
    "we also compared our results with hydrodynamic model calculation from e. retinskaya et al  @xcite which is consistent with the data at low transverse momentum and in central collisions .",
