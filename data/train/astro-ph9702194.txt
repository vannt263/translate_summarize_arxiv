    "almost all model fitting of single microlensing light curves to the data is done with a 4-parameter curve which assumes that the stellar image is not blended ( cf .",
    "paczyski 1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "however , the first two double lenses : ogle # 7 ( udalski et al . 1994b ) and duo # 2 ( alard et al . 1995 ) were found to have apparent images made of at least two objects : the lensed star and another unrelated star . also , at least one single event , ogle # 5 , was found to be strongly blended ( mao 1995 , alard 1996b ) . according to alard ( 1996b )",
    "most duo events are likely to be blended , and fitting data with unblended light curves introduces a systematic bias in the estimate of event time scales and optical depth .",
    "other effects of blending were considered by nemiroff ( 1994 ) , di stefano & mao ( 1995 ) , and by buchalter & kamionkowski ( 1996 ) .",
    "another issue is the lensing of very faint stars which become detectable only while lensed ( nemiroff 1994 ) .",
    "such objects are missed in searches like duo ( alard 1996a ) , eros ( auburg et al . 1993 ) , macho ( alcock et al .",
    "1993 ) and ogle ( udalski et al .",
    "1993 ) , but they are detectable in the searches which use the `` image subtraction '' technique , like agape ( bouquet et al . 1996 ) and columbia  vatt ( crotts & tomaney 1996 , tomaney & crotts 1996 , 1997 ) . an elaborate theory of this technique was developed by gould ( 1996 ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to demonstrate some of the practical consequences of blending , and the limitations imposed by unknown blends on the determination of lens parameters .",
    "let us consider an idealized situation with a variability due to microlensing superposed on arbitrary constant background of whatever nature : the sky , or the crowded field made of many stars or nebulae .",
    "we adopt an approximation according to which in a given small aperture ( it may be profiled as the psf , the point spread function ) there is a well measured level of brightness long before and long after the microlensing event : @xmath0 where @xmath1 refers to a standard deviation of a single measurement , and the number of measurements @xmath2 is very large .",
    "therefore , @xmath3 as well as @xmath1 are known very accurately .",
    "however , we do not know what fraction of @xmath3 is due to the star which is microlensed while it is in its normal , unlensed condition .",
    "let the flux from the lensed star be given as @xmath4 where the magnification due to microlensing is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the impact parameter in units of einstein ring radius , @xmath7 is the time at which maximum magnification is reached , and @xmath8 is the time it takes the lens to move with respect to the source by one einstein ring radius ( paczyski 1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "given a set of photometric measurements : @xmath9 , we would like to determine four parameters : @xmath10 . in principle",
    "the value of the fifth parameter : @xmath3 has to be determined as well .",
    "however , in practice a good microlensing search is conducted over a time interval much longer than the microlensing time scale @xmath8 , so we may simplify our task by adopting @xmath3 as known . in a common fitting procedure it is assumed that @xmath11 , and @xmath3 has to be determined from the same set of measurements as the other three parameters : @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that the errors ( standard deviations ) of the measurements scale as @xmath13 where @xmath1 is the error of a single measurement at intensity @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the fractional intensity of the lensed star far from the microlensing event , and the magnification @xmath16 is given with the eq . (",
    "our task is to find out how accurately the lens parameters can be determined . instead of a massive monte ",
    "carlo simulation we adopt another approach .",
    "first , the values of @xmath17 are fixed .",
    "the first two are assumed to be known to the observer , while the latter four are to be determined .",
    "the @xmath18 of the fit between a model and a string of quasi - data points @xmath19 is approximated with the sum : @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the intensities which follow from the model we are fitting , the quasi - observations @xmath23 are given with the eq .",
    "( 2 ) , and the measurement errors @xmath24 are given with the eq .",
    "our task is to determine the values of four parameters : @xmath25 by minimizing @xmath26 .",
    "note that because of measurement errors the value of @xmath26 can never be zero .",
    "it is minimized for the correct choice of the four parameters , when its value is @xmath27 .",
    "we shall also determine the confidence ranges of the four parameters for which the value of @xmath26 is within a chosen range of its minimum .",
    "for simplicity we assume that @xmath27 equally spaced measurements cover the time interval @xmath28 .    for small errors we can expand @xmath26 around its minimum to obtain :",
    "@xmath29 where @xmath30 is a vector of the parameter differences between the fitting and the model values , and @xmath31 , \\eqno(7)\\ ] ] at @xmath32 .",
    "for a quadratic expansion the confidence ellipsoid it describes scales linearly with the measurement errors . the errors with which all model parameters are determined scale linearly with the quantity @xmath33 , for @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    the best macho and ogle microlensing events had @xmath36 and @xmath37 , for the corresponding @xmath38 ( cf .",
    "udalski et al",
    ". 1994a , alcock et al . 1995 ) .",
    "a more typical values were @xmath39 . however , with the introduction of effective follow - up observations by the planet ( albrow et al .",
    "1996 ) and gman ( pratt et al . 1996 ) .",
    "a substantial increase of @xmath27 , a reduction of @xmath1 , and the corresponding reduction of the parameter @xmath40 have already been achieved in some cases , and farther improvement is expected in the near future .    in the following section",
    "we investigate some problems with the determination of model parameters imposed by the finite value of the @xmath40 parameter .",
    "there are two regions in the parameter space for which there is a near degeneracy , i.e. with any realistic accuracy of the measurements it is not possible to determine the unique values of all model parameters .",
    "the first troublesome case is that of a large impact parameter . in the limit @xmath41 the eqs .",

    "( 9 ) we recover the same formula for the @xmath45 . therefore ,",
    "if the set of parameters : @xmath46 is a solution then the set @xmath47 is also a solution , where @xmath48 is an arbitrary positive constant which satisfies @xmath49 .",
    "analytical considerations seem to imply that the trouble sets in when the impact parameter is very large , @xmath41 . in reality",
    "the situation is much worse .",
    "an example of the problem is shown in fig .",
    "1a , in which the two light curves shown with a solid and a dashed line , respectively , are almost identical .",
    "the truly troublesome aspect of this example is the value of the impact parameter : @xmath50 .",
    "this implies that in practice the degeneracy covers a broad range of impact parameters , and a seemingly robust microlensing event with the peak magnification in excess of 2 may have a blend which is photometrically undetectable in the event s light curve .",
    "another troublesome case is when the minimum flux , i.e. the flux measured far from the microlensing event , is dominated by a blend or by any background .",
    "this is a generic case in very crowded fields , like the bulge of m31 , in which microlensing events are to be detected by the `` image subtraction '' method ( bouquet et al .",
    "1996 , crotts & tomaney 1996 , tomaney & crotts 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "as the lensed object contributes little to the total light at minimum , the microlensing event can be detected only when the peak magnification is very large , i.e. the impact parameter is very small . in this case",
    "we have @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and a significant change in the brightness occurs only close to @xmath7 when the projected distance between the source and the lens is very small , i.e. when @xmath54 .",
    "we have @xmath55 and therefore @xmath56 ^{1/2 } } , \\hskip 0.5 cm { \\rm for } \\hskip 0.3 cm f_s \\ll 1 , \\hskip 0.3 cm t_{max } = 0 .",
    "\\eqno(12)\\ ] ] it is straightforward to verify that substituting the parameters @xmath57 into the eq . ( 12 ) we recover the same formula for the @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , if the set of parameters : @xmath46 is a solution then the set @xmath58 is also a solution , where @xmath48 is an arbitrary positive constant which satisfies @xmath59 .",
    "an example of such a case is shown in fig .",
    "a more quantitative way to analyze the degeneracy is to plot the confidence contours in the @xmath60 and in the @xmath61 planes .",
    "two sets of such plots are shown in fig .",
    "2 ; they correspond to the two cases presented in fig .",
    "it is apparent that the contours are highly elongated , i.e. a certain combination of model parameters may be determined with a reasonable accuracy , while the other combination is subject to a very large error .",
    "the photometric accuracy parameter @xmath62 was assumed , which may be achieved for example when @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the time of maximum magnification , @xmath7 , and the peak brightness , @xmath65 are not subject to any degeneracy in their determination as long as there are many points within fwhm of the light curve .",
    "unfortunately , these two parameters are of no particular significance for any inferences from the microlensing observations .",
    "those parameters which are significant : the event time scale @xmath8 and the impact parameter @xmath6 tend to have strongly correlated errors , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . it is a general property of blended microlensing events that some combination of the @xmath66 values can be determined with a good accuracy , while some other can be determined only poorly . in both cases of degeneracy as described with the eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 13 ) the product @xmath67 can be measured well , but the ratio @xmath68 can not be determined from the observations , as it can be equal to any number .",
    "therefore , we can not determine the values of @xmath8 and @xmath6 in these cases , only the value of the product of the two parameters .",
    "note , that in accordance with this analytical reasoning the confidence countours as shown in the @xmath60 plane in fig .",
    "2 appear to be streached along a hyperbolic shape .",
    "there are two dimensionless parameters which determine the shape of a blended microlening light curve : the impact parameter @xmath6 , and the fraction of minimum light contributed by the lensed source , @xmath69 . for a chosen value of the accuracy parameter @xmath70 we calculated values of the standard deviations in the determination of all four parameters : @xmath71 as a function of @xmath72 and @xmath6 , and they are presented in fig .",
    "the lines are labeled with the values of standard deviation .",
    "for example , in the upper left corner the error in the determination of the fraction of light in the lensed object , @xmath73 is equal 1.0 ( i.e. a huge error ) along the uppermost line , and the error is modest at 0.1 along the lowest line .",
    "if the accuracy parameter is smaller by a factor 10 , i.e. if @xmath74 , then the labels along all lines would be reduced by a factor 10 , i.e. the accuracy of the determination of @xmath72 would be 0.1 along the uppermost line , and 0.01 along the lowest line .",
    "a reduction of the @xmath40 parameter by a factor 10 can be accomplished by reducing the photometric error @xmath1 by a factor 10 , or by increasing the number of photometric measurements @xmath27 by a factor 100 .",
    "an inspection of the fig .",
    "3 reveals that only the time of maximum magnification @xmath7 can be well determined over a significant fraction of the parameter space .",
    "the other three parameters : @xmath75 are virtually impossible to measure above the lines with the label 1.0 . note that our choice of the accuracy parameter @xmath40 was optimistic by the standards of current microlensing seraches .    as the confidence contours are so elongated ( cf . fig .",
    "2 ) it is interesting to check if the best combination of the interesting parameters can be measured with a significantly higher accuracy than possible for each of the parameters separately .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "4 , where the right two panels present the lines labelled with the corresponding values of a standard deviation for the best linear combination of @xmath76 ( upper right panel ) and @xmath77 ( lower right panel ) . note , lines in these panels are placed much higher than the corresponding lines in fig .",
    "3 , i.e. the errors are strongly reduced by choosing the best combination of the parameter pairs , corresponding to the short axis of the elliptical confidence contours in fig .",
    "2 . on the other hand , the opposite choice , corresponding to the long axis of the elliptical confidence contour , and presented in the two left hand panels in fig .",
    "4 , reveal errors even larger than those corresponding to each parameter separately , as presented in fig .",
    "3 .    let us now ignore the presence of blends , and let us follow the standard procedure , assuming that @xmath11 . with this assumption",
    "we determine the values of the event time scale @xmath78 and the impact parameter @xmath79 .",
    "the parameters so determined may be compared with their true values @xmath8 and @xmath6 in fig .",
    "it is clear that by neglecting the blend we always overestimate @xmath6 and we underestimate @xmath8 , with the error increasing towards lower values of @xmath80 , i.e. stronger blending , and lower values of impact parameter .    with the blending effects being so important we should check when the presence of the blend can be established by means of photometry alone .",
    "it was done so with the two double lenses ( ogle # 7 , udalski et al .",
    "1994b ; duo # 2 , alard et al . 1995 ) and with one single lens ( ogle # 5 , s. mao , private communication 1995 , alard 1996b ) .",
    "unfortunately , this task is difficult for events caused by a single point mass , as shown in fig .",
    "6 , where the change in the value of @xmath26 is shown as a function of two dimensionless parameters : @xmath72 and @xmath6 .",
    "this is the difference between the @xmath26 values of a blended event as fitted with and without a blend . if the change is large then photometry alone",
    "can clearly demonstrate that the lensed source has a blend . the parameter space above the thick line @xmath81 is photometrically degenerate : in this region it is not possible to detect the presence of a blend with the photometric accuracy parameter @xmath70 at the confidence level 90%",
    "the main result of this paper is somewhat discouraging : with the currently typical photometric coverage and accuracy the light curve of a single microlensing event can not be used to determine the presence of a blend unless the impact parameter is small , @xmath82 , and the blend may be photometrically undetectable even if the impact parameter is very small ( cf . fig . 6 ) . in the real world",
    "we do not know the precise value of the measurement errors , and there is a significant contribution to the errors which is non - gaussian ( udalski et al .",
    "therefore , the photometric border of blend detectability as indicated by the thick line in fig .",
    "6 is optimistic , with the true border located at even lower values of @xmath6 .",
    "yet , the blending must be very common as demonstrated by the two double lensing events ( ogle # 7 , udalski et al .",
    "1994a ; duo # 2 , alard et al . 1995 ) , and by the recent analysis of the duo results ( alard 1996b ) .",
    "unless the blending is somehow corrected for , the microlensing time scales @xmath8 are underestimated , and the impact parameters are overestimated ( cf .",
    "fig . 5 ) .",
    "this implies that the lens masses and the optical depth are systematically underestimated .",
    "there are various ways in which the blending may be detected or at least statistically corrected for , as discussed by alard ( 1996b ) . in case of a double lens , with caustic crossings indicated by the light curve",
    ", a blend reduces the apparent magnification between caustic crossings below the theoretical minimum value @xmath83 ( witt & mao 1995 )  this was apparent in ogle # 7 and in duo # 2 . in case of any event ,",
    "double or single , a blend can be detected through a correlation between the image centroid and the apparent brightness , as first noticed in duo # 2 ( alard et al .",
    "this is possible if the angular separation between the lensed object and the blend is not too small , presumably no less than half a pixel , or so .",
    "if the blend has a different color than the lensed star then it may be uncovered with multi band lightcurves of a microlensing event ( buchalter & kamionkowski 1996 ) .",
    "if the luminosity function well below the detection threshold is known , say from the hst imaging , then the blending can be statistically corrected for by placing artificial stellar images on the ccd frames .",
    "the last approach has its limitations .",
    "as long as we do not know the distribution of separations and luminosity ratios of binary stars in the target population we can only put artificial stars randomly on a ccd frame . but",
    "this procedure will underestimate the number of very close binary pairs .",
    "fortunately , if the detected number of microlensing events is very large we can use the microlensing itself to determine the statistics of binary stars , as they will produce repeating microlensing events ( di stefano & mao 1996 ) .",
