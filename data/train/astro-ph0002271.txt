    "the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave radiation ( cmbr ) carries much cosmological information about primordial density fluctuations in the early universe .",
    "as photons leave the last scattering surface and travel across the universe , however , these brightness fluctuations are modified by intervening structures , causing secondary fluctuations , which we would expect to become more important on small angular scales .",
    "the power spectrum of the cmbr alone can be used to determine cosmological parameters .",
    "recently it has been shown , however , that a geometrical degeneracy effect prevents some combinations of cosmological parameters from being disentangled by the power spectrum alone ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the primordial density fluctuations and matter content determine the positions and magnitudes of the doppler peaks at the last scattering surface .",
    "these fluctuations are transferred to apparent angular scales determined by their angular diameter distance . as a result ,",
    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) models with the same primordial density fluctuations , matter content , and angular diameter distance can not be distinguished .",
    "the models are `` effectively degenerate '' in the sense that their power spectrum is degenerate for parameter determination on intermediate and small scales .",
    "although the observed power spectrum also depends on the time variation of the metric , via the integrated sachs - wolfe effect , this breaks the degeneracy only at large angular scales .",
    "unfortunately observations of the power spectrum do not provide strong constraints on models at large scales , since this is where the statistics of the data are dominated by the cosmic variance due to the fact that we have only one realization of our cosmological model , the universe itself , and we encounter a sampling problem ) .",
    "therefore we can determine , for example , only combinations such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the @xmath6 matter and baryon density parameters and @xmath7 is the dimensionless hubble parameter ) .",
    "it has been noticed that gravitational lensing can break the geometric degeneracy at small angular scales , @xmath8 , in such a way that the cosmological parameters can be determined separately ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of gravitational lensing on the cmbr was studied by several authors ( see for example @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "static gravitational lenses do not change a smooth cmbr , but the fluctuations get distorted by lensing . as a result ,",
    "power from the acoustic peaks is transferred to small angular scales , conserving the variance of the spectrum .",
    "the amount of power transferred depends on the cosmological model , thus , in principle , we can determine separately @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath7 .",
    "this method makes use of the small angular scale part of the power spectrum , where the amplitude of primordial fluctuations is declining and secondary fluctuations are becoming more important .",
    "the question naturally arises : how do contributions to the power spectrum from secondary fluctuations influence parameter determination based on the small scale cmbr power spectrum ?",
    "the most important secondary fluctuations are the thermal static and kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich ( ssz and ksz ) effects ( @xcite ) , the rees - sciama ( rs ) effect ( @xcite ) , the moving cluster of galaxies ( mcg ) effect ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , point sources ( @xcite ) , and , if the universe was re - ionized at some early stage , the ostriker - vishniac effect ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on secondary effects caused by clusters of galaxies . since detailed reviews are available on the sz and the mcg effects ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , here we just summarize their major features .",
    "the thermal sz effect is a change in the cmbr via inverse compton scattering by electrons in the hot atmosphere of an intervening cluster of galaxies .",
    "we use the terms kinematic or static sz effect depending on whether or not the intracluster gas possesses bulk motion . to date",
    "only the static thermal sz effect has been detected ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mcg effect is a special type of rs effect , due to the time - varying gravitational field of a cluster of galaxies as it moves relative to the rest frame of the cmbr . unlike the original rs effect",
    ", the mcg effect is not caused by intrinsic variation of the gravitational field , so that in the rest frame of the cluster , the photons fall into and climb out of the same gravitational field .",
    "however , in the rest frame of the cluster the cmbr is not isotropic , but has a dipole pattern , being brighter in the direction of the cluster peculiar velocity vector .",
    "photons passing the cluster are deflected towards its center .",
    "thus in the direction of the cluster peculiar velocity vector ( ahead of the cluster ) one can see a cooler part of the dipole pattern . towards the tail of the cluster , one can see a brighter part of the dipole ( ahead of the cluster ) . when transferring back to the rest frame of the cmbr , we transfer the dipole out , but the fluctuations remain , showing a bipolar pattern of positive and negative peaks . at cluster center",
    "there is no deflection , thus there is no effect .",
    "the amplitude of the mcg effect is proportional to the product of the gravitational deflection angle and the peculiar velocity of the cluster .",
    "the most important characteristics of the ssz , ksz , and mcg effects in the context of cosmology is that their amplitudes do not depend on the redshift of the clusters causing the effect .",
    "using thermodynamic temperature units , their maximum amplitude are about 500 @xmath9k , 20 @xmath9k , and 10 @xmath9k , respectively .",
    "the ssz and ksz effects have the same spatial dependence as the line of sight optical depth , the mcg effect has a unique bipolar pattern . assuming a king approximation for the total mass and an isothermal beta model for the intracluster gas , the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the ssz and ksz effects @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the core radius , depending on @xmath12 , which is typically between 2/3 and 1 .",
    "the mcg effect has a much larger spatial extent , with fwhm for each part of the bipolar distribution @xmath13 .",
    "the spectra of the effects are also important : the ssz effect has a unique spectrum which changes sign from negative to positive at about 218 ghz .",
    "the ksz and mcg effects have the same frequency dependence as the primordial fluctuations .",
    "the most important difference between the sz effect and the mcg effect is that the sz effect is caused by intracluster gas , the mcg effect is caused by gravitational lensing by the total mass regardless the physical nature of that mass .",
    "therefore the sz effect only arises from clusters with intracluster gas .",
    "clusters can produce significant mcg effects even if devoid of intracluster gas .",
    "the effects of clusters of galaxies on the cmbr in a given cosmology have been a subject of intensive research since the late 1980s .",
    "there are several different ways of extracting information from these effects .",
    "source counts of the ssz effect were estimated by using the press - schechter mass function ( psmf ) and scaling relations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; 1994 ; @xcite ; @xcite , de luca , desert & puget 1995 , @xcite ; 1997 , @xcite ) .",
    "the importance of the ssz effect was demonstrated and it was shown that thousands of detections are expected with the next generation of satellites .",
    "contributions to the cmbr from the rs and the ksz effects were derived by tuluie , laguna & anninos ( 1996 ) and seljak ( 1996 ) for cdm models with zero cosmological constant .",
    "tuluie et al .",
    "used n - body simulations and a ray - tracing technique , seljak used n - body simulations and second order perturbation theory .",
    "contributions from the ssz and ksz effects originating from large scale mass concentrations ( superclusters ) were studied by persi et al .",
    "bersanelli et al .",

    "simulated @xmath14 maps with pixel size of @xmath15 .",
    "they used the psmf normalized to x - ray data ( assuming an x - ray luminosity - mass relation ) .",
    "the total mass was assumed to have a navarro - frenk - white profile ( @xcite ) , and the intracluster gas was assumed to follow an isothermal beta model distribution .",
    "the time evolution of the electron temperature and the core radius were assumed to follow models of bartlett & silk ( 1994 ) , which are based on self - similar models of kaiser ( 1986 ) . according to aghanim et al .",
    "( 1998 ) s results , the ksz effect is many orders of magnitude stronger than the primordial cmbr on small angular scales , and therefore the effect would prevent the use of the power spectrum to break the geometric degeneracy .",
    "atrio - barandela & mucket ( 1998 ) estimated the power spectra of the ssz effect in a standard dark matter dominated model with different lower mass cut - offs .",
    "contributions to the power from the ostriker - vishniac effect in cdm models were estimated by jaffe & kamionkowski ( 1998 ) .    in this paper",
    "we estimate the contributions to the cmbr power spectrum from the ssz , ksz , and mcg effects on small angular scales adopting cold dark matter dominated models . in our models we assumed scale invariant primordial fluctuations with a processed spectrum having a power law form on cluster scales with a power law index of @xmath16 ( bahcall & fan 1998 ) .",

    "we used @xmath24 as indicated by observations ( bahcall and fan 1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "we used observationally determined cluster abundances as a constraint on the psmf . where necessary , we altered the model parameters resulting from the usual top hat spherical collapse model since that model is only an approximation . in our scdm model",
    "we changed only the overall normalization of the psmf by multiplying it by 0.23 ( a similar normalization was used by @xcite ) .",
    "this procedure is inconsistent with the interpretation of the psmf as a probability distribution ( it does not integrate to unity ) , but we use results for the scdm model only as a comparison to the other two models . in our lambda - cdm model",
    "we multiplied the critical density threshold , @xmath25 , obtained from the spherical collapse model ( equation  [ [ e : delta_c ] ] ) , by 1.23 ( which is equivalent to changing the @xmath26 normalization ) and made no other changes .",
    "our ocdm model needed no adjustments . with these changes",
    "all three models agree well with the present day ( @xmath27 ) observed mass spectrum ( figure  [ f : psmf_obs ] ; bahcall & cen 1993 ) . for high masses ,",
    "the first two models ( ocdm , and cdm ) also agree with the observed @xmath28 dependence of the high mass cumulative mass function ( figure  [ f : psmf_z_obs ] ; bahcall , fan & cen 1997 ) .",
    "the cdm and the scdm models agree with cmbr constraints , while the ocdm model is rejected by these constraints ( @xcite ) . as a cautionary note ,",
    "it is useful to keep it in mind that taking _ all _ data into account none of these models are acceptable .",
    "we assumed that the total mass distribution follows a truncated king profile ( @xcite ) .",
    "for the intra - cluster gas we assumed an isothermal beta model ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) .",
    "isothermal beta model fits to x - ray images of clusters give @xmath29 ( @xcite ) .",

    "we follow the precepts of @xcite and adopt @xmath34 .",
    "this choice provides a mass temperature function which is in a good agreement with the observed function ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fitted x - ray spatial distribution is highly dependent on the x - ray structure of the core , and may be expected to be less reliable in the outer regions of clusters .",
    "the sz effect is more sensitive to the outer regions ( the sz effect is proportional to the electron density as opposed to thermal bremsstrahlung , which is proportional to density squared ) . choosing the spectroscopically derived @xmath34 gives a smaller sz effect , and so our choice of @xmath12 should provide a conservative estimate of the contribution of the sz effect to the power spectrum .",
    "a slightly larger @xmath12 would not change our results significantly . although the beta model describes the inner intra - cluster gas well , for more accurate sz work an improved cluster model , which fits the outer regions better , will be needed .",
    "the other physical parameters were determined using the virial theorem , a spherical collapse model , and models of the intra - cluster gas by colafrancesco & vittorio ( 1994 ) .",

    "we took velocity bias into account , and assumed that the peculiar velocities are isotropically distributed .",
    "we used analytical approximations to calculate the contributions of the ssz , ksz and mcg effects to the cmbr power spectrum .",
    "these contributions are important only at small angular scales , where we can neglect the overlap between cluster images and ignore the weak cluster - cluster correlation , and therefore we can approximate the resulting power spectrum by summing the contributions from individual clusters ( similar methods were used by @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite ) .",
    "we expanded the ssz , ksz , and mcg effects as laplace series ( i.e. , series of spherical harmonics ) , then determined the individual cluster contributions and summed over the clusters ( for a detailed description see @xcite ) .",
    "our approximation breaks down at large angular scales , but at these scales primordial fluctuations dominate the cmbr , and the cluster contribution is only a minor perturbation , so that only a rough indication of the cluster effect is needed .",
