    "there is an increasing interest in the novel properties of interfaces and junctions of superconductors and ferromagnetic materials.@xcite one of the most interesting effects is the formation of a josephson @xmath0-junction in superconductor / ferromagnetic - metal / superconductor ( s / fm / s ) heterostructures.@xcite in the ground - state phase difference between two coupled superconductors is @xmath0 instead of 0 as in the ordinary 0-junctions . in terms of the josephson relationship @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the phase difference between the two superconductor layers , a transition from the 0 to @xmath0 states implies a change in sign of @xmath6 from positive to negative .",
    "such a negative @xmath6 was originally found in the josephson effect with a spin - flip process.@xcite in s / fm / s junctions , such a sign change of @xmath6 is a consequence of a phase change in the pairing wave - function induced in the fm layer due to the proximity effect .",
    "the existence of the @xmath0-junction in s / fm / s systems has been confirmed in experiment by ryanzanov et al.@xcite and kontos et al.@xcite    recently , a quiet qubit consisting of a superconducting loop with a s / fm / s @xmath0-junction has been proposed.@xcite in the quiet qubit , a quantum two - level system ( qubit ) is spontaneously generated and therefore it is expected to be robust to the decoherence by the fluctuation of the external magnetic field . from the viewpoint of the quantum dissipation , however , the structure of s / fm / s junctions is inherently identical with s / n / s junctions ( n is a normal nonmagnetic metal ) .",
    "thus a gapless quasiparticle excitation in the fm layer is inevitable .",
    "this feature gives a strong dissipative effect@xcite and the coherence time of s / fm / s quiet qubits is bound to be very short .",
    "therefore josephson @xmath0 junctions with a nonmetallic interlayers are highly desired for qubit application .    on the other hand , a possibility of the @xmath0-junction formation in josephson junctions through ferromagnetic insulators ( fis ) have been theoretically predicted@xcite and intensively analyzed by use of the quasiclassical green s function techniques.@xcite recently , by extending these results , we have proposed superconducting phase@xcite and flux qubits@xcite based on s / fi / s @xmath0-junctions .",
    "moreover we have also showed that the effect of the dissipation due to a quasi - particle excitation on macroscopic quantum tunneling is negligibly small.@xcite these results clearly indicate the advantage of the fi based @xmath0-junction for qubit applications with longer coherence time .",
    "however , up to now , a simple @xmath7-function potential@xcite has been used in order to model the fi barrier . in this phenomenological model , the up ( down ) spin electrons tunnel through a positive ( negative ) delta - function barrier .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , this model describes not ferromagnetic insulators but half metals with infinitesimal thickness .",
    "moreover the possibility of the @xmath0-junction formation in the finite barrier thickness case is also an unresolved problem . in order to resolve above issues ,",
    "we formulate a numerical calculation method for the josephson current through fis by taking into account the band structure and the finite thickness of fis explicitly . in this paper",
    "we present our recent numerical results@xcite on the formation of the @xmath0-coupling for the josephson junction through a fis , e.g. , la@xmath8bacuo@xmath9 and k@xmath8cuf@xmath10 and show that the mechanism of the @xmath0-junction in such systems is in striking contrast to the conventional s / fm / s junctions .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the magnetic properties and the electronic density of states ( dos ) of fis .",
    "the typical dos of fi for each spin direction is shown schematically in fig",

    "we calculate the josephson current through such fis numerically .",
    "in this section , we develop a numerical calculation method for the josephson current of s / fi / s junctions based on the recursive green s function technique.@xcite let us consider a two - dimensional tight - binding model for the s / fi / s junction as shown in fig .  2 .",

    "in this section we show numerical results of the josephson current for low-@xmath1 superconductor / fi / low-@xmath1 superconductor junctions and discuss the physical origin of the @xmath0-junction formation in such systems.@xcite in the calculation , we assume @xmath56 and set @xmath57 , and @xmath58 . the phase diagram depending on the strength of @xmath14 ( @xmath59 for fm and @xmath60 for fi ) and @xmath61 is shown in fig .

    "the black ( white ) regime corresponds to the @xmath0- ( 0-)junction , i.e. , @xmath62 in the case of fi , the @xmath0-junction can be formed .",
    "moreover , the 0-@xmath0 transition is induced by increasing the thickness of the fi barrier @xmath61 and the period of the transition is @xmath63 and just @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66.@xcite we also found that the atomic - scale 0-@xmath0 transition is also thermally stable.@xcite on the her hand , in the case of fm , the oscillation period strongly depends on @xmath14 and the temperature.@xcite     and @xmath61 for fm ( @xmath59 ) and fi ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the black and white regime correspond to the @xmath0- and 0-junction , respectively.,width=321 ]    a physical origin of the appearance of the @xmath0-junction and the atomic scale 0-@xmath0 transition can be explained as follows.@xcite in the high barrier limit ( @xmath67 ) , josephson critical current is perturbatively given by@xcite @xmath68 here @xmath69 is a transmission coefficient of the fi barrier for up ( down ) spin electrons . in the case of the single - cite fi ( i.e. , @xmath70 ) ,",
    "the transmission coefficients are analytically given by use of the transfer matrix method@xcite as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a spin - independent complex number .",
    "therefore the sigh of the critical current @xmath73 becomes @xmath74 , so the @xmath0-junction is formed in the case of single - cite fi barrier . on the other hand , the transmission coefficients for an arbitrary value of @xmath75 can be expressed by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a complex number .",
    "so the sign of the critical current @xmath78 becomes negative for the odd number of @xmath61 and positive for the even number of @xmath61 .",
    "therefore we can realize the atomic - scale 0-@xmath0 transition with increasing the thickness of the fi barrier @xmath61 as demonstrated in fig .",

    "recent development of the pulsed laser deposition technique enable us to layer - by - layer epitaxial - growth of such oxide materials.@xcite therefore , the experimental observation of the 0-@xmath0 transition by increasing the layer number of lbco could be possible .    in order to show the possibility of @xmath0-coupling in such realistic htsc junctions , we have numerically calculated the @xmath83-axis josephson critical current @xmath6 based on a three - dimensional tight binding model with @xmath84 and @xmath85 being the numbers of lattice sites in @xmath86 and @xmath87 directions [ fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a)].@xcite in the calculation we have used a hard wall boundary condition for the @xmath86 and @xmath87 direction and taken into account the @xmath41-wave order - parameter symmetry in htsc , i.e. , @xmath88 the tight binding parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 have been determined by fitting to the first - principle band structure calculations  @xcite .",

    "the current passed through the ring divides between the junction 1 and 2 , @xmath100 @xmath101 applied external magnetic flux @xmath102 depletes phases @xmath103 and @xmath104 causing interference between currents through the junctions 1 and 2 . for a symmetric ring with @xmath105 and negligible geometric inductance ( @xmath106 ) , the total critical current as a function of @xmath102",
    "is given by @xmath107 for the case that @xmath61 of the both junctions are same .",
    "if @xmath61 of the junction 1(2 ) is even and @xmath61 of the junction 2(1 ) is odd , we get @xmath108 therefore the critical current of a 0-@xmath0 ( 0 - 0 ) ring has a minimum ( maximum ) in zero applied magnetic field .",
    "@xcite experimentally , the half - periodic shifts in the interference patterns of the htsc ring can be used as a strong evidence of the @xmath0-junction .",
    "such a half flux quantum shifts have been observed in a @xmath40-wave ring made with a s / fm / s  @xcite and a s / quantum dot / s junction .",
    "@xcite    it is important to note that in the case of @xmath83-axis stack htsc josephson junctions,@xcite no zero - energy andreev bound - states@xcite which give a strong ohmic dissipation@xcite are formed .",
    "moreover , the harmful influence of nodal - quasiparticles due to the @xmath41-wave order - parameter symmetry on the macroscopic quantum dynamics in such @xmath83-axis junctions is found to be week both theoretically@xcite and experimentally.@xcite therefore htsc / lbco / htsc @xmath0-junctions would be a good candidate for quiet qubits .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the josephson effect in s / fi / s junction by use of the recursive green s function method .",
    "we found that the @xmath0-junction and the atomic scale 0-@xmath0 transition is realized in such systems .",
    "by use of the transfer matrix calculation , the origin of the @xmath0-junction formation can be attributed to the @xmath0 phase difference of the spin - dependent transmission coefficient for the fi barrier .",
    "such fi based @xmath0-junctions may become an element in the architecture of quiet qubits .",
    "we would like to point out that the @xmath0-junction can be also realized in the josephson junction through an another type of fi , i.e. , a spin - filter material , in the case of the strong hybridization between localized and conduction electrons.@xcite it should be also note that fi materials treated in this paper can be categorized in strongly correlated systems .",
    "moreover , in actual junctions , the influence of the interface roughness could be important .",
    "therefore investigation of the atomic - scale 0-@xmath0 transition in the presence of the many - body and disorder effect will be also the subject of future studies .",

    "<S> based on these results , we show that stable @xmath0-state can be realized in junctions based on high-@xmath1 superconductors with la@xmath2bacuo@xmath3 barrier . </S>",
    "<S> such fi - based josephson junctions may become an element in the architecture of future quantum computers . </S>"
