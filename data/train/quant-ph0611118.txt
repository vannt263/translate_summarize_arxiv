    "the study of quantum vacuum @xcite is of great interest in physics due to recent astrophysical observations supporting an accelerating universe @xcite . in various models ,",
    "the acceleration is attributable to a cosmological term triggered by quantum vacuum effects @xcite .",
    "in addition , the development of models unifying gravity and the other interactions has led to predictions of the existence of new yukawian forces in the micrometer range with coupling of the same order of magnitude as gravity @xcite .",
    "these motivations are encouraging many theoretical and experimental studies into the physics of quantum vacuum and its interplay with cosmology and elementary particle physics @xcite .",
    "the casimir force @xcite is an important accessible window in this context ( see @xcite for monographs and reviews ) and , particularly in the last decade , has been studied with an increasing level of accuracy in various geometries , from parallel plates @xcite to sphere - plane @xcite .",
    "detailed knowledge of the casimir force is important to master all the corrections in order to constrain , from the residuals of the actual experiments , the presence of yukawian forces in the micrometer range . in particular ,",
    "the interplay of casimir forces with thermal photons due to a blackbody background and in presence of realistic cavities is not fully understood , and it seems likely that only experiments will be able to discern among the models proposed so far .",
    "the contribution of thermal photons grows with the size of the cavity in which the casimir pressure is exerted , thus one needs to measure the casimir force at large distances .",
    "given the reduced sensitivity of atomic force microscope experiments at large distances and the weak signal expected with a sphere - plane geometry , the most promising configurations to look for casimir forces at large distances are the cylinder - plane and the parallel plane geometries",
    ".    thermal effects are not solely a result of finite temperature environment , since the motion of objects in quantum vacuum in itself also gives rise to heating .",
    "in fact , it has been predicted that non uniformly accelerated objects should dissipate energy in the form of photons , a phenomenon known as the dynamical casimir effect @xcite . when specialized in a cavity configuration",
    ", this effect is also equivalent to parametric production of photons through quantum vacuum .",
    "the predicted casimir photon production is quite low for realistic configurations , necessitating low - noise , high - sensitivity detection techniques such as hyperfine or rydberg atomic spectroscopy . in this paper",
    "we discuss the current status of three ongoing experimental projects aimed at measuring the thermal contribution to the casimir force and observing the predicted vacuum photons emitted from an non - uniformly accelerated resonant cavity . in section 2",
    "we discuss the predictions for the thermal contribution to the casimir force expected for both the cylinder - plane and the parallel plane configurations .",
    "we then describe some experimental issues for the corresponding experimental efforts ongoing at dartmouth and in grenoble , focusing on potential hurdles for the projects .",
    "finally , in section 3 , we briefly describe a proposal to detect the dynamical casimir photons based upon atomic spectroscopy and high frequency mechanical resonators .",
    "the thermal contribution to the casimir force has not yet been detected , in spite of its importance as a background to new forces in the 1 @xmath1 10 @xmath0 m range .",
    "this scenario is complicated by the presence of models which yield different results when finite temperature and finite conductivity are taken into account @xcite .",

    "the dielectric permittivity along the imaginary frequency axis can be computed using tabulated optical data for different metals . for the range of temperatures to be probed in the experiments ( a few degrees around @xmath18 k ) , permittivity data corresponding to matsubara frequencies @xmath19 with @xmath20 can be extracted from the optical data .",

    "each measurement carries 100 averages ( each average lasting 32 s ) , and after the first 7 measurements we experienced an abrupt change in distance ( manifested both by a swallower curvature and a higher frequency ) as well as in the angle formed by the cylinder axis and the resonator surface ( manifested by a displacement in the voltage for which there is the minimum frequency shift ) .",
    "a second abrupt change has taken place after another 6 measurements , in the same direction for the drift of both the gap distance and angle .",
    "the continuous curves are the distinct parabolic fits to each set of data .",
    "the overall duration of the run was @xmath63 18 hours.,width=302 ]      the apparatus we are developing to measure the casimir force in a cylinder - plane configuration has been described in @xcite as are parallelization and calibration techniques . here",
    "we focus on possible complications in measuring the casimir force due to the finite thermal stabilization of the apparatus .",
    "this is reflected first of all in the stability of the parallelism .",
    "long term thermal drifts on the apparatus affect the parallelism and therefore limit the total measurement time .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the parallelism can be assessed by intentionally rotating the cylinder around its midpoint .",
    "the parallel configuration is that which minimizes the frequency - shift due to an external spatially dependent force , such as the electrostatic force , and this is shown in fig . 2 for a relatively long measurement time .",
    "the curves are fitted as pieces of parabolas but both the curvature and the center of the parabolas are different , with the shallower curve corresponding to a larger distance between the cylinder and the plane .",
    "this can be interpreted as due to sudden drifts in the separation distance , and will be mitigated in future versions of the apparatus with improved thermal stabilization and the use of materials like invar alloys with minimal thermal expansion coefficients .",

    "the four curves also show a common trend with a minimization of the error for a number of averages between 8 and 16 , corresponding to a frequency window @xmath66 between 25 and 50 hz , _ i.e. _ about 10 times the resonator linewidth of @xmath67 hz .",

    "error bars represent the statistical uncertainty of the fitting procedure.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    the thermal drifts are also an indirect reason for limiting the number of averages in a long - time measurement of the casimir force .",
    "a measurement of the casimir force around 3 @xmath0 m capable of disentagling between the two different models for the temperature corrections , as discussed above and in @xcite , requires high force sensitivity .",
    "one possible detection scheme , which has been used to calibrate the apparatus , is based on the measurement of frequency shifts of the resonator induced by a spatially - dependent force @xcite in the ( ideal ) case of a perfect stability ( no drifts in frequency or other parameters ) , an ideal theoretical understanding of the response , and an infinite number of measurements , one could achieve an exact determination of the peak frequency for any value of the mechanical quality factor .",
    "obviously , none of these conditions are fulfilled in an actual experiment .",
    "the parameters of the resonator may drift in time , there may be an incomplete understanding of the background which produces residuals in the fit , as well as statistical fluctuations due to the finite number of averages .",
    "this gives then rise to a finite precision in determining any parameter modeling the resonator response , including the peak frequency .",
    "we have studied the dependence of the precision in the determination of the peak frequency versus the number of averages of the fft transform of the photodiode signal resulting from a fiber optic interferometer @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "3 ( left ) the error in the determination of the peak frequency is fitted by the standard @xmath68 dependence .",
    "due to the presence of thermal drifts , one can not expect ideal behaviour even in the limit of infinite averaging .",
    "it is therefore important to study how to optimize the precision in the determination of the peak frequency for a fixed measurement time .",
    "once the latter is fixed we can choose to measure on a large window ( at the price of worse frequency resolution on the fft analysis ) or viceversa .",
    "3 ( right ) we plot the error in the determination of the peak frequency versus the selected window of the fft analyzer ( or , equivalently , versus the sampling time for each measurement ) . it is evident that the error on the peak frequency is optimized for an intermediate value of the windowing .",
    "larger windowing yields poor frequency resolution inherent to the fft , partially compensated by the decreased statistical uncertainty resulting from the larger number of averages , while small windowing allows for better frequency resolution at the cost of large statistical fluctuations .",
    "our tests indicate that the error on the peak frequency is minimized by using a window about ten times the intrinsic bandwidth of the mechanical resonator ( on the order of 2 - 3 hz in our case ) .",
    "this also shows that , unless particular care is taken to minimize thermal drifts , the use of large mechanical quality factors for the resonators does not necessarily improve the sensitivity , as the longer measurement times required for the optimal narrower windowing will make the resonator more prone to thermal drifts : in the presence of finite thermal stability there will be , for the frequency - shift measurement technique , an optimal quality factor for the resonator .",
    "the parallel plate configuration , as discussed in @xcite , has still a high priority for performing casimir force measurements due to the unique features of this geometry .",
    "in particular , it may provide the strongest limits on non - newtonian gravity in the 1 - 10 @xmath0 m range due to the largest attainable signal and the absence of gravitational force gradients apart from boundary effects @xcite .",
    "due to the importance of investigating non - newtonian forces in recent unification frameworks , this research program is currently pursued by our collaboration . in order to measure the thermal contribution , the steep scaling of the parallel plane casimir force with respect to distance requires the use of large , macroscopic surfaces , which in turn leads to the use of a high - sensitivity torsional balance @xcite . in our project ,",
    "two pairs of plates are installed on opposite arms of the moving and static parts of the balance , respectively ( see fig .",
    "these plates have a surface area of 120 @xmath69 for the measurement at the largest gaps , on the order of 10 @xmath0 m . for smaller distances ( @xmath63 1@xmath0 m )",
    "the effective area can be reduced to 15 @xmath69 , which minimizes the chance of having dust trapped in the gap .",
    "the target torque sensitivity is in the 1 - 100 @xmath0n / rad range , obtainable with quartz wire of diameter 50 - 150 @xmath0 m .",
    "this allows for a minimum detectable force of order 1 pn .",
    "three high precision piezoelectric actuators and their feedback controllers maintain a constant distance between the two plates throughout the duration of the measurement , with an accuracy of 0.2 @xmath0 m .",
    "capacitors symmetrically located on the opposite sides of the active surfaces for the measurement of the casimir force allow for further control of the gap distance .",
    "the distance between the capacitor plates is large enough ( 100 @xmath0 m ) to avoid backaction effects on the torsional balance , yet provide adequate sensitivity .",
    "parallelization procedures will be based on expertise already acquired in grenoble through an experiment in which discretization of the energy levels of ultracold neutrons in the earth gravitational field has been observed @xcite . while in these experiments parallelism between the neutron reflecting surface and",
    "the absorber has been kept to about 10@xmath70 radians , the expected parallelism with the use of the piezoelectric actuators and auxiliary capacitors is around 10@xmath71 radians .",
    "the surface roughness should be around 1 - 2 nm . in a second stage of the experiment ,",
    "metallic layers with thickness of @xmath72 m will be used when searching for hypothetical yukawa forces with gravitational coupling , and this may lead to a degradation of the surface quality . the availability of _ in situ _ diagnostic techniques in surface science laboratories already present in grenoble will provide complete characterization of the surfaces .        another potential hurdle along the way is the tilting of the mirrors in the arms of the torsional balance .",
    "this can be addressed by reducing the lever of the torsional balance , properly designing the position of its pivot point , and segmenting the electrodes in such a way that small tilts do not result in changes of the effective surface .",
    "the latter solution also implies a control of the border effects , which have to be carefully estimated for instance through the worldline numerics approach pioneered in @xcite .",
    "the experiment is currently in preparation ( see figs . 5 ) and the first calibrations of the apparatus are planned in early 2006 . once again , we want to stress that various physical signals can be used to calibrate this apparatus , including the possibility of measuring the gravitational force through a cavendish - like experiment .",
    "this allows for a simple expression of the apparatus sensitivity in terms of the maximum distance at which a known gravitational source may be detected - a parametrization of the sensitivity particularly natural when discussing the limits to yukawa forces in the micrometer range .",
    "the emission of photons due to the dissipative nature of motion in quantum vacuum has been predicted using various analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite .",
    "dissipation is expected when a material body undergoes a non uniform acceleration .",
    "the phenomenon is often discussed in the context of a resonant cavity where the amplification of vacuum field energy is enhanced due to a periodic motion of a boundary and the build - up of photons in the cavity . from this point of view",
    "the phenomenon , also called dynamical casimir effect , consists of the amplification of vacuum field energy as the periodic modulation of the cavity boundaries excites a particular mode of vacuum field , with the transformed state being squeezed .",
    "the number of photons in the mode ( if uncoupled to any other mode ) increases exponentially as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the amplitude of the modulation and @xmath75 depends on the geometry of the cavity and on the particular resonant mode @xcite . in practice the exponential growth is constrained due to the finite optical quality factor @xmath76 , with the growth saturating at times @xmath77 . typically , for cylindrical cavities with rectangular or circular sections , @xmath78 .",
    "therefore the number of produced photons is approximated as @xmath79 . for @xmath80 (",
    "about a few nm displacement in the ghz range ) and @xmath81 , a typical number of photons expected is on order of unity .",
    "the result is very sensitive to the value of @xmath82 , the photon number being @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "these estimations illustrate the difficulty of the observation of this phenomenon",
    ". the number of created photons could be much larger if , instead of considering a cavity with moving boundaries , one considers a cavity with time - dependent reflectivity .",
    "the effective length of the cavity could be changed by irradiating with fast laser pulses a thin semiconductor film contained in it @xcite .",
    "it has been recently shown , using a simplified model @xcite , that in this case one could reasonably get @xmath85 , but the heating due to the laser pulses and the generation of excitations in the semiconductor @xcite are an open issue for the current implementation of this scheme as in the mir experiment @xcite .",
    "li by means of controllable electromagnetic fields ( top picture ) .",

    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "the vacuum amplification takes place inside a resonant cavity where an array of mechanical resonators are coherently oscillating .",
    "these mechanical resonators of high frequency are available ( up to 3.1 ghz ) due to the recent development of the film bulk acoustic resonator ( fbar ) devices .",
    "the integral part of the fbar devices is a thin piezoelectric film made of aluminum nitride ( ain ) for which the mechanical frequency can be changed with a varying thickness @xcite .",
    "depending on the nature of two - level atoms , one could detect the progressive change in atomic population either by fluorescence ( photon detection ) or by field ionization procedure ( electron detection ) .",
    "the original scheme relies on the hyperfine splitting of @xmath87 whose transition frequency in the ground state is 228 mhz , which is the lowest among alkali atoms , thereby allowing a reasonable matching with the working frequency of available high - frequency mechanical nanoresonators . apart from the difficulty of fabricating an ensemble of mechanical resonators coherently driven at a well - defined frequency ( 456 mhz ) , the use of hyperfine splitting seems disadvantageous due to an extremely low stimulated emission rate .",
    "for a two - level atom , the stimulated emission rate is directly proportional to the spontaneous rate given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the matrix element for the dipole transition between _",
    "_ i__th and _ _ j__th states .",
    "for the two hyperfine ground states of li , the magnetic dipole interaction dominates the transition , which gives rise to an additional factor of @xmath90 , lowering the emission rate by @xmath91 compared to the usual electric dipole interaction .",
    "furthermore , the estimated power of casimir photons for @xmath92 is @xmath93w , too small to induce the hyperfine transition .    in order to maximize the atomic emission rate",
    ", one could consider an electric dipole transition with a larger matrix element .",
    "the most natural choice satisfying these criteria is the use of circular rydberg atoms @xcite having large electric dipole moment ( @xmath94 ) and relatively long lifetime ( @xmath95 ) @xcite , already employed in the studies of cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite and quantum information processing@xcite .",
    "the transition frequency can in principle be chosen at will by varying the principal quantum number up to @xmath96 @xcite , which provides a great tunability with a mechanical resonator .",
    "although the use of rydberg atoms greatly increases the stimulated emission rate , the number of photons generated inside the cavity is still too small to be measured through an appreciable change in atomic population .",
    "this issue can be overcome by exploiting an additional amplification procedure through super - radiance .",
    "the overall scheme is identical to the super - radiant maser system in the millimeter wave domain considered in @xcite . in super - radiance a single atom undergoing a transition",
    "triggers a subsequent emission on the neighboring atoms resulting in a large pulse whose lifetime is inversely proportional to the number of atoms present in the coherent volume .",
    "as long as the number of casimir photons produced inside a resonant cavity exceeds the number of spontaneously emitted photons during the atomic travel time across the cavity , it is possible to measure the triggering effect of the casimir photons on the super - radiant pulse through control of delay time , polarization , and phase @xcite . because the estimated number of casimir photons is very small however",
    ", the triggering effect may be dominated by the vacuum fluctuations or the presence of thermal photons as well . for this super - radiance scheme to be effective , the casimir photons must be the dominant triggering source .",
    "so far , we have built at dartmouth a @xmath86li atomic beam source to study optical pumping and detection of hyperfine states populations ( see fig .",
    "7 ) , which can be easily extended to rubidium atoms , the most natural candidate for the preparation of rydberg states in our scheme .",
    "we have described ongoing experimental efforts in casimir physics , with the goal of studying the interplay between _ pure _ quantum fluctuations and thermal effects , either in the form of thermal photons - always present in any finite temperature environment , or photons originating from the dissipative nature of non - uniformly accelerated motion of an object in quantum vacuum .",
    "the combination of strong signals at large distances and relatively simple parallelization makes the investigation of the casimir force in a cylinder - plane geometry quite attractive , allowing for discrimination between theoretical approaches .",
    "recent technological advances make possible the achievement of almost ideal parallelization in the parallel plane geometry , providing strong constraints on hypothetical yukawian forces .",
    "use of hyperfine or super - radiant rydberg atoms for the detection of the dynamical casimir effect will require a delicate balance in the parameter space , and yet it promises exciting insights into the dissipative nature of quantum vacuum .",
    "these combined efforts should lead towards a more comprehensive understanding of fluctuation and dissipation of quantum vacuum .",

    "<S> we report on current efforts to detect the thermal and dissipative contributions to the casimir force . for the thermal component , two experiments are in progress at dartmouth and at the institute laue langevin in grenoble . </S>",
    "<S> the first experiment will seek to detect the casimir force at the largest explorable distance using a cylinder - plane geometry which offers various advantages with respect to both sphere - plane and parallel plane geometries . </S>",
    "<S> in the second experiment , the casimir force in the parallel plane configuration is measured with a dedicated torsional balance , up to 10 @xmath0 m . </S>",
    "<S> parallelism of large surfaces , critical for this configuration , is maintained through the use of inclinometer technology already implemented at grenoble for the study of gravitationally bound states of ultracold neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> for the dissipative component of the casimir force , we discuss detection techniques based upon the use of hyperfine spectroscopy of ultracold atoms and rydberg atoms . </S>",
    "<S> although quite challenging , this triad of experimental efforts , if successful , will give us a better knowledge of the interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and of the nature of dissipation induced by motion of objects in quantum vacuum . </S>"
