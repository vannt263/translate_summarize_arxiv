    "since the discovery of carbon nanotubes @xcite , the peculiar electronic and mechanical properties of these structures have attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "experiments have also revealed that they can also be used to store hydrogen @xcite and other gases @xcite .",
    "many physicists expected that gases in nanotubes or nanotube bundles may display novel 1-dimensional ( 1d ) behavior as a consequence of the remarkable aspect ratio of the length of tubes to their radius .",
    "the group led by cole @xcite and other researchers @xcite have theoretically studied properties of gases in nanotubes or nanotube bundles .",
    "one of the most fantastic properties they found is specific heat of dilute gas inside single - walled carbon nanotubes ( swnt s ) as a functions of temperature : with temperature increasing it shows the thermal behavior changing from 1d , 2d , and 3d .",
    "however , there are still two question arisen : do 1d and 2d behaviors always exist for dilute gas inside swnt only if the temperature is low enough ? is classical statistical mechanics ( csm ) sufficient to deal with this problem ?    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we has given a brief answer to the first question .",
    "here we will exhibit the full calculations and continue to discuss the second question . in recent papers ,",
    "siber _ et al _ treat the specific heat of dilute he atoms adsorbed in interstitial channels and grooves of carbon nanotube bundles @xcite . here",
    "we partially follow their aprroach .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec.[coord ] , we give the expressions of the coordinates of carbon atoms in a unit cell of a swnt . in sec.[potential ] , we analytically calculate the potential of ne in a carbon nanotube . for example",
    ", we calculate the potential of ne in ( 20,20 ) tube . in sec.[statis ] , we list the related formula of thermodynamics in statistical mechanics to calculate the specific heat . in sec.[cvhigh ] , we calculate the specific heats of ne inside ( 20,20 ) at different temperatures without considering @xmath4 effects ( @xmath4 are defined in sec.[coord ] ) . in sec.[cvlow ] , we calculate the specific heats of ne inside ( 20,20 ) at low temperature . in sec.[classic ] , we discuss why we do not use csm to calculate the specific heat . in this section , we present a coarse method to estimate the characteristic temperature , below which the csm can not be used . in sec.[discuss ] , we discuss the reliability of our results and give brief conclusions .",
    "a swnt without two caps can be constructed by wrapping up a single sheet of graphite such that two equivalent sites of hexagonal lattice coincide @xcite . to describe the swnt",
    ", some characteristic vectors require introducing . as shown in fig.[fig1 ] , the chiral vector @xmath5 , which defines the relative location of two sites , is specified by a pair of integers @xmath6 which is called the index of the swnt and relates @xmath5 to two unit vectors @xmath7 and @xmath8 of graphite ( @xmath9 ) .",

    "the number @xmath16 of hexagons per unit cell of swnt is obtained as a function of @xmath17 and @xmath18 as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the greatest common divisor of ( @xmath21 ) and ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "there are @xmath23 carbon atoms in each unit cell of swnt because every hexagon contains two atoms . to denote the @xmath23 atoms",

    "when we deal with the thermal behavior of dilute ne in nanotube , we will begin with the free energy @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is temperature and @xmath72 is the partition function .",

    "moreover , the specific heat per atom is @xcite @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 .    in fig.[fig5 ] , the symbols  @xmath110 \" reflect @xmath111 varying with the temperature @xmath71 , which implies ne atoms inside ( 20,20 ) tube behave as the lattice gas @xcite at ultra low temperature ( specific heat is 0 ) and 2d gas at low temperature ( specific heat approaches 1 ) .",
    "there is no 1d gas inside ( 20,20 ) tube , which is quite different from our usual notion .",
    "at the sufficient high temperature , @xmath83 converge to the @xmath84 . if a carbon nanotube , for example ( 20 , 20 ) tube , just a geometric tube with diameter @xmath144 nm , the characteristic temperature @xmath145 k. we just need to use the csm if @xmath146 .",
    "however , here the carbon nanotube provides potential to ne . in the potential , it is difficult matter to calculate the characteristic temperature is not a simple matter .",
    "for example , consider some atoms in a harmonic potential @xmath147 .",
    "we can easily calculate the specific heat per atom @xmath148 ^ 2 $ ] @xcite .",
    "here we have set @xmath149 .",
    "we know @xmath150 if @xmath151 and this is the classical case .",
    "thus we can set @xmath152 ( in the whole form @xmath153 ) .",
    "above discussion suggests that @xmath0 depends on the potential .",
    "we propose a coarse method to obtain @xmath0 which is the least root of the following equation : @xmath154 the physical meanings of parameters in eq.([eq1 ] ) are shown in the fig.[rsm1 ] .",
    "for the potential @xmath147 in above example , @xmath155 , using eq.([eq1 ] ) we arrive at @xmath156 ( the whole form is @xmath157 ) . for ( 20,20 ) nanotube , the approximate potential is @xmath65 $ ] , with @xmath66  , @xmath67 k , and @xmath68  .",
    "we can numerical solve eq.([eq1 ] ) and give @xmath3 k. if @xmath146 ( e.g. @xmath158 k ) , the classical case is expected and csm is valid .",
    "but csm can not be used if @xmath2 ( e.g. @xmath159 k ) , especially @xmath160 k.    in fig.[fig4 ] we give results obtained from os and csm .",
    "the information shown in fig.[fig4 ] agrees with our coarse estimate to @xmath0 very well .",
    "therefore , using the cms is insufficient .",
    "it is necessary to consider the quantum mechanics . in other words ,",
    "quantum mechanics must be used when studying the behaviors of gases in the nanometer scale .",
    "we notice that the potential @xmath161 is a function of @xmath64 and @xmath162 , where @xmath163 are parameters of a carbon nanotube , and @xmath164 are two integers . under this symmetry",
    ", we must use a generalized bloch s theorem ( see appendix ) to find the eigenvalues of schrdinger equation .",
    "we can also obtain the secular equation of energies .",
    "although we have 16 pentium iv computers , but the data and computing time exceed our computers ability if we calculate the specific heat with temperature varying from 0 to 400 k. but , fortunately , we find that the variation of potential with @xmath4 is less than 30 k , much smaller than that with @xmath38 . in sec.[cvhigh ] , we neglect the effect of the variation of potential with @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , this effect can be neglected under high temperature in terms of intuition . at high temperature , the values of @xmath111 approach to that calculated from csm .",
    "we show them in fig.[rsmb1 ] , in which the triangles are values neglected the effect of @xmath4 and the line is the result calculated from csm considering the effect of @xmath4 .",
    "it suggests our intuition is reliable .",
    "we know the effect of @xmath4 is important under the low temperature . in sec.[cvlow ] , we consider this effect in detail . because the shape of @xmath161 is very sharp and deep with r ,",
    "the particles are confined in the bottom of @xmath112 at low temperature .",
    "thus we can consider the effect of @xmath4 but neglect the effect of @xmath38 at low temperature .",
    "therefore , we believe that we have grasped the main factors under at high and low temperature and our qualitative conclusions are reliable .    the interactions ( include the contribution from the polarization of the pi - electrons ) between ne and c atoms are intermolecular forces , van der waals type interactions .",
    "as the theoretical study , the simplest form of van der waals force is the lenard - jones potential .",
    "we believe that the eventual results based on the lenard - jones potential are qualitatively reasonable .",
    "maybe , many researchers @xcite use it because of the same reasons .",
    "indeed , the more detailed study needs to consider the gay - berne potential @xcite or other complex potentials .",
    "we are considering to overcome this difficult problem by using numerical simulations .",
    "it is necessary to notice that we just consider the dilute ne and the interactions between ne atoms are naturally neglected .",
    "therefore we do not describe the phase transition of ne in swnt s .",
    "if we intend to deal with the phase transition , we must include the interactions between ne atoms and use the methods of quantum field theory , such as the renormalization group approach @xcite , etc .    in conclusion",
    ", we calculate the specific heat of ne in ( 20,20 ) swnt at low and high temperature and find the dimensional crossover of thermal behavior in this system . especially , the dilute ne gas exhibits as 2d behavior at low temperature or 2d lattice behavior at ultra low temperature .",
    "the simple physical picture is that all atoms are confined on a shell blow a critical temperature .",
    "in sec.[cvhigh ] , we calculate the specific heat with neglecting the effect of @xmath4 ; and in sec.[cvlow ] , in fact , we neglect the effect of @xmath38 . in other words , we do not obtain the specific heats in a consistent way from low to high temperature .",
    "indeed , the potential @xmath161 is a function of @xmath64 and satisfies @xmath165 , where @xmath164 are two integers .",
    "if a potential satisfies this condition , it is called the spiral symmetric . under this spiral symmetry , we must use a generalized bloch s theorem to find the eigenvalues of schrdinger equation and then calculate the specific heat in a consistent way @xcite .",
    "above all , we go over traditional translational symmetry and bloch s theorem @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of a system with the translational symmetry is expressed as @xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath168 are integers .",
    "define translational operators @xmath169 , which act on a function @xmath170 as : @xmath171 it follows that @xmath172 and @xmath173f({\\bf r}+{\\bf r}_j)=h\\mathcal{j}({\\bf r}_j)f({\\bf r}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore @xmath174 is the set of conserved quantities . in this case",
    ", an eigenfunction of the hamiltonian must be an eigenfunction of the translational operators , i.e. , @xmath175 if @xmath176 .",
    "furthermore , the electron density must be periodic , i.e. , @xmath177 .",
    "it follows that @xmath178 but from eq.([b4 ] ) , we know @xmath179 the solution of eq.([b7 ] ) under the constraint eq.([b8 ] ) is @xmath180 .",
    "thus we have bloch s theorem : @xmath181    next , we will turn to the spiral symmetry and generalize the bloch s theorem .",
    "the hamiltonian with the spiral symmetry in cylindrical coordinates is expressed : @xmath182 @xmath183 where @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath129 .",
    "define vectors @xmath186 , @xmath187 in the space @xmath188 , and operators @xmath189 which act on a function @xmath190 as @xmath191 .",
