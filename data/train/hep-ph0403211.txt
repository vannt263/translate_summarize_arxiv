    "in virtue of parity violation the experiments have shown that all fermions emitted from decay processes are longitudinally polarized .",

    "so we could further consider that the lifetime of fermions in the lh helicity state and that in the rh helicity state should be different .",
    "namely , the lifetime asymmetry should exist in left - right handed polarized fermions .",
    "however , the experimental and theoretical study on the polarization or helicity of the initial fermions in decays has not yet been discussed fully in the literature . in a previous paper@xmath1}$ ] we have given a first discussion of the problem on lifetime asymmetry .",
    "in this paper we continue the study of this issue .",
    "the differences among spin states , helicity states and chirality states are emphasized and the lifetime asymmetry of polarized muons will be calculated concretely .",
    "in the standard model ( sm ) , all of fundamental fermions are divided into two classes , lh chirality state and rh chirality state , in order to describe the parity violation in weak interactions .",
    "the lh chirality state is different from the rh chirality state .",
    "the former is a su(2)-doublet state whereas the latter a su(2)-singlet state , hence they have different gauge transformations .",
    "especially , rh chirality states have zero weak isospin and are only present in neutral weak currents .",
    "therefore , only lh chirality states exist in charged weak currents .",
    "the interaction lagrangians for charged weak lepton current and charged weak quark current read , respectively @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the coupling constant corresponding to su(2 ) and the subscript @xmath4 denotes the lh chirality state . obviously , all fermions are in the lh chirality states while all antifermions are in the rh chirality states .",
    "for example , the weak interaction in muon decay is successfully described by four - fermion interaction hamiltonian .",
    "we denote the matrix element by @xmath5 where @xmath6 indicates a scalar , vector or tensor interaction , and @xmath7 indicate a right- or left - handed chirality of the electron or muon .",
    "the chiralities @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 are then determined by the values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "all coupling constants have been obtained entirely from experiments without any model assumption.@xmath14}$ ] the experiments on muon decay show @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 to be zero , and at least one of the two coupling , @xmath18 or @xmath19 , to be nonzero .",
    "the experiments on inverse muon decay provide a lower limit for pure @xmath20 interaction with @xmath21 .",
    "thus the measurements give a strong support to the sm which sets @xmath22 while all others being zero , and then indicate that the charged weak current is dominated by a coupling to left - handed chirality fermions .",
    "therefore , the negative muon decay can be written as @xmath23 and the matrix element ( 3 ) has the form @xmath24",
    "there exist three kinds of spinor wave functions , i.e. , the spin states , the helicity states and the chirality states .",
    "we will discuss the difference and the relation among them .",
    "the spin states are the plane wave solutions of dirac equation , and in momentum representation for a given four - momentum @xmath25 and mass @xmath9 , the positive energy solution and the so - called negative energy solution are respectively @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are pauli spin wave functions .",
    "the state with @xmath30 is spin up ( @xmath31 ) while the state with @xmath32 is spin down ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "they are eigenstates of operator , @xmath34 , with eigenvalues @xmath35 , namely @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the pauli - lubanski covariant spin vector and @xmath38 is the four - polarization vector in the form @xmath39 which is normalized @xmath40 , orthogonal to @xmath41 . in the rest frame",
    "@xmath38 reduces to @xmath42 . in application",
    "it is frequently necessary to evaluate spin sums in the form @xmath43 the @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the positive energy projection operator and the negative energy projection operator , @xmath46 respectively and @xmath47 are spin projection operators : @xmath48 the plus sign refers to @xmath30 and the minus sign to @xmath32 .",
    "one sees that the operator @xmath49 project out the positive energy states with spin up and @xmath50 the positive energy states with spin down , whereas the operator @xmath51 the negative energy states with spin down and @xmath52 the negative energy states with spin up in its rest frame .",

    "the state with @xmath61 is the rh helicity state while the state with @xmath62 is the lh helicity state .",

    "the polarization vector does not change its sign under the space inversion and so is called a pseudovector or an axial vector , like angular momentum .",
    "the helicity can only take the value of either @xmath74 or @xmath75 and has no meaning in its rest frame .",
    "but the degree of polarization can take any value between @xmath76 and @xmath74 and the value remains constant in different frame . in the spin states the polarization of fermions is described by polarization vector .",
    "it is the discrepancy between the helicity and the polarization vector that results in the spin state being different from the helicity state .",

    "( [ eq:9 ] ) that the property of vector @xmath77 is different from that of pseudovector @xmath73 .",

    "meanwhile , the importance of helicity state and its difference from spin state and chiral state were often confused or overlooked .",
    "our lesson and experience are just focused on the above crucial point before we are able to get rid of the constraint of covariant four spinor form .",
    "what we eventually realized is to discriminate two things : while a physical law like that reflected by the dirac equation is one thing , a phenomenon like a particle s velocity , its helicity as well as its decay lifetime is another thing .",
    "a law should be invariant under the lt , but a phenomenon needs not .",

    "in short , the information is not existing totally in the sense of objectiveness , it is created by the subject and object in common .    the measurements on muon decay used to be performed in its rest frame .",
    "it was realized that muons , formed by forward decay in flight of pions inside cyclotron , were stopped in a nuclear emulsion , sulphur , carbon , calcium or polyethylene target .",

    "so far the measurement of the lifetime of polarized muons in flight has not yet been found in literature .",
