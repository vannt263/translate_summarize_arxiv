    "rr lyrae variable stars ( rrl ) are among the most popular standard candles for measuring distances to old stellar populations , both within the galaxy and to other galaxies in the local group .",
    "common targets include galactic globular clusters , the galactic center , the magellanic clouds and the dwarf spheroidal companions of the galaxy , and even m31 and m33 and their companions .",
    "the distance scale adopted for the globular cluster system also defines the mean age and age distribution of that system .",
    "globular clusters ( gcs ) place strong constraints on the chronology of star formation and chemical evolution in the early galaxy . also",
    ", the age of the oldest gcs places a firm lower limit on the age of the universe , thus providing an important consistency check on studies determining fundamental cosmological parameters .",
    "clearly , an accurate calibration of the rr lyrae absolute magnitude , @xmath5 , is vitally important for many fields of astronomy .",
    "@xcite reviewed the status of this calibration after the results of the _ hipparcos _ astrometry satellite had been digested .",
    "they compared the results of numerous distance estimation techniques , and found encouraging evidence that the long - standing dichotomy between the long and short distance scales was at last yielding better consistency .",
    "still , evidence persisted that different techniques produced systematically different results .",
    "for example , their careful analysis of main - sequence fitting techniques consistently produced a distance scale about 0.1 mag brighter than the mean of other methods .",
    "they also demonstrated that the chief limitation of this technique was the restricted sample of subdwarf stars available with high quality parallaxes .",
    "until another astrometry satellite is launched , it seems unlikely this technique will undergo substantial improvement .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to explore and develop other techniques for calibrating the rrl luminosity .",
    "one technique still in its natal stages is white dwarf ( wd ) sequence fitting .",
    "wd fitting is analogous to main sequence ( ms ) fitting except that the cluster s wd cooling sequence is fit to local wds with trigonometric parallaxes ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and/or theoretical model cooling sequences ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "wds possess a number of advantages over ms stars which may result in more trustworthy fits .",
    "first , wd atmosphere models in this temperature range involve different physics from ms stars , some of which is simpler : there is no convection involved , and the opacities are dominated by hydrogen or helium .",
    "complexities in wd models such as core composition and crystalization should not produce significant luminosity differences between wds in globular clusters and the field at the temperature and mass range of interest .",
    "the models thus involve a different set of systematic uncertainties with respect to the ms models , and therefore provide a new and independent means for obtaining globular cluster distances .",
    "second , the luminosity of a wd is nearly independent of the star s initial , ms composition .",
    "thus the large number of disk wds near the sun are available as calibrators .",
    "the main source of observational uncertainty in wd fits involves wd masses , @xmath6 .",
    "the @xcite sequences indicate @xmath7 mag  @xmath8 at a given color @xcite .",
    "fortunately , gcs have a very narrow range of masses evolving off the ms feeding the wd track , and various arguments indicate that @xmath9 for gcs @xcite .",
    "this uncertainty translates into @xmath100.05 mag in distance modulus .",
    "unfortunately , wds are extremely faint , so wd fitting has not been pursued extensively .",
    "@xcite found the brightest wd in ngc  6397 , at @xmath11 mag , @xmath1010 mag fainter than the horizontal branch .",
    "accurate wd fits require reasonable photometry ( @xmath100.1 mag ) several magnitudes down the wd sequence , so very deep imaging is required .",
    "significant wd sequences have been uncovered in only a handful of globulars to date @xcite .",
    "most of these clusters have extremely red or blue horizontal branch ( hb ) stars , and contain few or no rrl .",
    "any estimates of @xmath5 based on these clusters require extrapolating the hb across the rr lyrae pulsation strip .",
    "this can be done with the aid of theoretical hb models , but at the cost of the assumptions and uncertainties inherent in those models .",
    "the exception , m4 , is rich in rrl , but suffers from a high foreground reddening which varies spatially across the cluster and which follows a non - standard reddening law @xcite .",
    "this complication translates into substantial uncertainty in any rrl luminosity calibration thus derived .    the nearest globular with both a low reddening and abundant rrl is m5 ( ngc  5904 ) .",
    "we have therefore undertaken a project to measure the distance to m5 using wd fitting , and thereby calibrate the luminosity of its rrl .",
    "this paper describes our deep imaging of m5 using the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , our photometric analysis procedure and methodology for detecting wds ( sec .",
    "[ sec_obs ] ) , and our distance analyses using both wd fitting ( sec .",
    "[ sec_wdfit ] ) and main sequence fitting ( sec . [ sec_msfit ] ) . in secs .",
    "[ sec_rrlmag ] and [ sec_mvrr ] , we combine these results with extensive photometry of the m5 rrl compiled from the literature to provide rrl luminosity calibrations in several forms .",
    "we discuss our results and how they might be improved upon in sec .",
    "[ sec_concl ] .",
    "images of a region in m5 were obtained using the _ wide field and planetary camera 2 _ ( wfpc2 ) aboard _ hst _ as part of program go-8310 .",
    "the wfpc2 region is located at equatorial coordinates @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( j2000 ) , about 200 arcsec north of the cluster center at a point providing a high surface density of white dwarfs with minimal crowding by bright cluster stars .",
    "images were obtained using the f555w and f814w filters during four visits to the cluster as described in table [ tab_visits ] .",
    "this table includes the date of each visit , the orbit number within the visit , the filter used , and the number and length of exposures obtained during the orbit .",
    "the telescope pointing was dithered slightly between orbits two and three of visits 1 , 2 , and 3 , and between each of the orbits of visit 4 .",
    "shorter exposures were included to provide photometry of brighter stars useful for photometric comparisons with ground based photometry . the total exposure times in f555w and f814w were 13,695 sec and 20,260 sec , respectively , obtained over fifteen spacecraft orbits .",
    "raw images and optimal calibration frames were downloaded and recalibrated `` on the fly '' from the canadian astronomical data centre .",
    "the resulting calibration employed improved bias and dark files compared with the original calibration provided by the space telescope science institute .",
    "rejection of cosmic rays was accomplished using the stsdas task crrej . in each orbit shown in table [ tab_visits ] ,",
    "cosmic rays were detected in the stack of three long - exposure images by iteratively rejecting deviant intensity values at each pixel location , with the rejection criterion becoming stricter in each iteration .",
    "we also tested for cosmic rays in pixels adjacent to known cosmic rays . for each orbit ,",
    "the result was a mask identifying the location of cosmic rays on each of the three images .",
    "the masked f555w images from all six orbits were then shifted and combined using montage2 @xcite to produce a high signal - to - noise image with the cosmic rays rejected .",
    "note that in this image , the pixels where cosmic rays were eliminated have a lower signal - to - noise than the pixels which enjoyed uncorrupted data values . in a typical mask for a single image",
    ", we found that @xmath106% of the pixel locations were affected by cosmic rays . using this cosmic ray rate",
    ", we performed a simple statistical model to determine the fraction of wfpc2 pixel locations affected , and to estimate the signal - to - noise degradation caused by cosmic rays to our combined image .",
    "about one third of the wfpc2 pixels were unaffected by cosmic rays , while @xmath1038% of the pixel locations suffered a cosmic ray hit in one of the stacked intensity values . in total , @xmath1098% of the wfpc2 pixels",
    "were affected by three or fewer cosmic rays , causing a signal - to - noise to drop of at most 9% relative to pixel locations with no cosmic rays .",
    "this indicates that the vast majority of the area surveyed has fairly uniform characteristics that should not affect significantly our detection of faint stars .",
    "the worst case encountered in the model was when seven cosmic rays hit a particular pixel location , leading to a 22% drop in signal - to - noise relative to unaffected pixels . however , such cases were rare , affecting only @xmath1020 pixels across the entire survey area .",
    "we conclude that the presence of cosmic rays has had minimal impact on the detection of faint stars .",
    "as we will show in the following section , detection incompleteness due to crowding is significantly more important .",
    "we used sextractor @xcite to find and classify sources on the final , combined f555w image .",
    "the resulting list of object positions was used as input to allframe @xcite to perform point spread function ( psf ) fitting photometry on the individual , cosmic ray - masked f555w and f814w frames .",
    "each frame was first multiplied by a geometric correction frame obtained from the _ hst _ archive to correct for distortions in the apparent area of pixels produced by the wfpc2 cameras .",
    "experimentation with the tunable parameters in allframe and sextractor was done to optimize extraction of the faint wd candidate stars in our frames . the high signal - to - noise _ hst _ psfs for f555w and f814w that were utilized in the reduction of _ hst _",
    "images by the cepheid distance scale key project team ( silbermann et al .",
    "1996 , kindly provided by peter stetson ) were applied to each of our 59 frames .",
    "positional transformations between each frame and a reference image were used by allframe to simultaneously iterate on the positions and magnitudes of each object supplied by sextractor .",
    "the result was profile - fitting photometry for approximately 8000 sources in each of the long exposure wf frames .",
    "we did not perform photometry on the pc images since the small area of sky covered by that chip would yield very few wd stars . besides using sextractor to find objects in the wfpc2 frames",
    ", we also retained the `` class '' parameter computed by sextractor . while not strictly a bayesian classification , the value of class is approximately the probability that any given object is stellar , with 1.0 representing definite unresolved sources , and 0.0 representing definite non - stellar sources .",
    "we will return to the use of this morphological information below , when we discuss cleaning the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "we then reapplied sextractor to find additional faint sources on the psf - subtracted images produced by allframe .",
    "however , inspection of the images showed that many detections were of residual light where the psf had been imperfectly subtracted from the undersampled profile of an object detected in the first application of sextractor .",
    "furthermore , a high fraction ( 79% ) of these objects were classified as non - stellar by sextractor . though we ran these additional objects through allframe to determine magnitudes for them , further tests ( see sec .",
    "[ sec_cmd_clean ] ) indicated that they would add to our data set many false detections and few stars upon which high - quality photometry could be done .",
    "therefore , we report magnitudes only for the objects detected in the first application of sextractor .",
    "we note that the second application of allframe photometry did help to improve the photometry of the stars found in the first pass by accounting for , at least approximately , the light from nearby , fainter objects .      at this point",
    ", we followed the procedure outlined by @xcite to obtain aperture corrections which convert our instrumental , psf - fitting photometry from allframe into the equivalent aperture magnitudes via a zeropoint offset .",
    "we then applied the @xcite transformation equations to convert our instrumental aperture magnitudes from the f555w and f814w filters into calibrated @xmath14 and @xmath15 photometry ( respectively ) on the scale of @xcite , which represents the work of the _ hst _ cepheid key project .",
    "we then corrected for a number of well - known photometric effects in the wfpc2 system .",
    "as recommended by the wfpc2 instrument team , time - dependent corrections for charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) effects were installed based on the prescription of @xcite , updated using the data available on his web site .",
    "the ccd dewar window throughput also changes as a function of time .",
    "after carefully examining the effect of adding these small ( @xmath160.002 to + 0.012 mag ) , photometric offsets , we determined that the main sequences in the three different wf chips were less aligned with the corrections than without , so we did not apply these corrections . had we applied these corrections , their effect would have been anyway small , with a maximum of + 0.007 mag in the @xmath14-band , and a maximum of + 0.006 mag in @xmath17 .",
    "table [ tab_phot ] contains data on all the objects detected on the three wf chips by the first application of sextractor .",
    "the first column contains an identification number generated by allframe , the second column indicates upon which chip the object fell ( wf2 , wf3 , or wf4 ) , and the next two columns indicate the object s @xmath18 and @xmath19 pixel coordinates on that chip .",
    "columns 58 show the @xmath14 and @xmath15 magnitudes and their errors ( specifically , the frame - to - frame standard error of the mean , propagated through the photometric transformation equations of @xcite ) .",
    "the remaining columns present the sextractor parameters describing the ellipticity of the object , its full - width at half - maximum in pixels , and the object s morphological `` class '' value .",
    "the electronic file contains data for 10,409 objects .",
    "figure [ fig_cmd]a shows the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for all objects listed in table [ tab_phot ] .",
    "the curves represent the log(g ) = 7.5 and 8.0 wd cooling tracks from @xcite , shifted to account for typical reddening and distance modulus values for m5 .",
    "these tracks are meant only to guide the eye in finding the cmd location of cluster wds , and are not used in our wd fitting analysis ( sec .",
    "[ sec_wdfit ] ) . clearly , the large number of objects spread throughout the middle and blue side of figure [ fig_cmd]a makes it difficult to determine whether wds are present .",
    "we employed the morphological `` class '' criterion of sextractor to statistically reject objects that did not have stellar profiles . after experimenting with morphology cuts , we found that keeping only objects with class @xmath20 0.75 gave the greatest reduction in non - stellar objects while retaining most stellar objects . the exact cut value did not matter greatly , and higher class values ( greater probability of the object being stellar ) gave similar results .",
    "the resulting cmd is presented in figure [ fig_cmd]b .",
    "we note that the number of blue objects scattered between the wd and ms regions in figure [ fig_cmd]b would be much higher had we included the objects detected in the second application of sextractor ( to the psf - subtracted image ) discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_cmd_phot ] .",
    "a cmd of these objects contains a much higher fraction of blue objects relative to ms objects than is seen in figure [ fig_cmd]b ( 29% and 2% , respectively ) , and only 12 objects fell near the @xcite wd tracks .",
    "the vast majority of these sources were faint objects in the wings of brighter stars that were found in the first application of sextractor .",
    "since our goal is to obtain the highest quality photometry possible , and does not require a high degree of completeness , our purposes are best served by omitting these stars from the cmd .    the cleaned cmd shown in figure",
    "[ fig_cmd]b has a narrow , well - defined main sequence extending from just above the ms turn - off to over eight magnitudes below the turn - off .",
    "a few dozen wd candidates can be seen in the region around the model cooling tracks .",
    "this number agrees with expectations calculated from the number of stars evolving off the msto in figure [ fig_cmd ] , by way of the evolution rate determined from isochrones @xcite and the wd cooling rate @xcite .",
    "such calculations are rough given the small number of stars involved and the uncertain degree of detection completeness suffered by the wd and msto stars . still , the agreement between the observed and expected number of wds in figure [ fig_cmd]b indicates that we are not missing a large fraction of the wds due to over - aggressive cleaning of the cmd .",
    "most of the blue objects scattered between the wd and ms regions in figure [ fig_cmd]b can be attributed to distant , unresolved galaxies . using statistics from the hubble deep fields",
    "@xcite , we expect there to be roughly 33 to 39 unresolved background galaxies with @xmath21 mag in our cmd .",
    "this number is slightly less than the number of blue objects seen in figure [ fig_cmd]b , suggesting that the latter may include some field stars located behind the cluster in the galactic halo .",
    "the errors presented in columns 6 and 8 of table [ tab_phot ] indicate the internal , random errors associated with our photometry .",
    "we determined typical error values for stars in specific regions of the cmd shown in figure [ fig_cmd]b by computing the median uncertainties in @xmath14 and @xmath17 within selected magnitude and color ranges . at @xmath22 mag ,",
    "the median errors in @xmath14 and @xmath17 are 0.015 and 0.019 mag , respectively .",
    "they gradually increase at fainter magnitudes , reaching 0.056 and 0.061 mag for stars at the lower end of the ms , and 0.051 and 0.098 mag in the wd region .",
    "the internal errors for stars brighter than @xmath22 mag increase to @xmath100.036 and @xmath100.047 mag because lower signal - to - noise photometry was included from a few short exposure wfpc2 images .    to obtain an estimate of the external , transformation - based errors in our photometry , we compared our final wfpc2 photometry with the m5 standard fields observed by @xcite .",
    "for the fifteen bright stars in common between the two datasets , we find offsets of @xmath23 and @xmath24 mag , with no correlation with color or magnitude . while the zeropoint differences in the magnitude scales are statistically significant , it is gratifying to find that the @xmath17 color scales are essentially identical .",
    "we note that these fifteen stars are among the brightest in our data set .",
    "they were derived from short exposure images and may not accurately represent the photometry of wd and lower ms stars , derived from the long - exposure images , about eight magnitudes fainter .",
    "since it is not evident which zeropoints are correct , we have chosen _ not _ to apply these magnitude offsets to our photometry .",
    "instead , we will quote our distances with and without these offsets .",
    "it is instructive to obtain a sense of the depth of our photometry in terms of the physical properties of low - luminosity stars .",
    "we estimate the mass of the faintest main sequence stars visible in our photometry by comparing with the isochrones of @xcite . a slight extrapolation below the low - mass limit of the isochrone with @xmath25 and age of 14.1 gyr suggests the ms stars at our photometric limit of @xmath26 mag have masses of about 0.14 @xmath27 .",
    "though our photometry is deep , we are not reaching the ms hydrogen burning limit , which is predicted by some models to be @xmath108 mag below the faintest ms stars in our data set . nor are we reaching the lower limit of the wd cooling sequence expected at @xmath28 mag , or the wd luminosity function jump created by the changing atmospheric opacity due to neutral hydrogen expected at @xmath29 mag @xcite .",
    "while our data is not suited to examining the transition between lower ms and brown dwarf stars or determining the age of m5 from its wd stars , it is well suited for its intended purpose : a distance estimate to m5 based on wd fitting .",
    "figure [ fig_cmd]b presents a distinct sequence of several dozen wd candidates running from @xmath30 mag to the limit of the photometry at @xmath31 27 mag .",
    "we zoom in on the wd region in figure [ fig_wdfit ] .",
    "we restrict our wd distance analysis to stars with @xmath32 mag to minimize bias due to incompleteness near the limit of our photometry , and to minimize uncertainty as the errorbars increase with magnitude .",
    "we inspected the f555w and f814w images at the locations of the 27 cluster wd candidates in figure [ fig_wdfit ] .",
    "most candidates are isolated and should not be subject to systematic photometry errors due to crowding .",
    "there are several marginal cases worth noting , however .",
    "the star at ( @xmath17 , @xmath14 ) = ( 0.32 , 25.10 ) is located near a brighter star whose diffraction spike probably compromises our photometry .",
    "the stars at ( 0.21 , 24.38 ) , ( + 0.27 , 25.12 ) , and perhaps ( 0.25 .",
    "25.26 ) may also have crowding - related errors .",
    "we placed less weight on these stars in our analysis as described below .",
    "@xcite determined a distance to the globular cluster 47  tuc by matching wfpc2 photometry of local wds which have known masses and trigonometric parallaxes to wfpc2 photometry of likely wds in 47  tuc . in order to avoid dependencies on the assumed photometric transformations , zoccali et al .",
    "compared the local and 47  tuc wd samples in the instrumental magnitude system , after incorporating the @xcite cte corrections .",
    "zoccali et al .",

    ", we made a small correction to their local wd instrumental magnitudes ( kindly provided by m. zoccali ) for the difference in cte corrections they used and the more updated cte corrections currently supplied by dolphin .",
    "we determined updated cte corrections for the field wds by downloading the wfpc2 observations from the _ hst _ archives , then measuring the wd fluxes and surrounding sky values for each frame .",
    "the cte corrections under the two dolphin prescriptions were computed and compared to each other .",
    "the difference in the two corrections only amounts to 1% , in the sense that the @xcite correction is 1% larger than the more modern correction , specifically 0.0013 mag compared to 0.0003 mag , for these particular wds .",
    "finally , we applied the @xcite photometric transforms to the field wds to put them on the same scale as our m5 wds .",

    "this narrow requirement for inclusion was chosen for this first iteration on determining the m5 wd distance both to avoid extrapolation and to omit stars with photometry possibly contaminated by crowding . to accomplish the fitting",
    ", we used gaussfit , a code for least squares and robust estimation @xcite , which allowed us to fully incorporate uncertainties in the colors and magnitudes , the covariance between color and magnitude , and the uncertainty in the slope of the fit to the field wd sequence .",
    "the resulting distance modulus was 14.70 @xmath35 0.12 mag . in a slightly different approach , using the same data but without the single most deviant ( brightest ) object , we simultaneously fit a single slope and two intercepts for the field wd and m5 wd data .",
    "this yielded a distance modulus of 14.85 @xmath35 0.32 mag .",
    "figure [ fig_wdfit]a presents the wd region of the cmd , including the calibrating field wds ( triangles ) and the m5 wds used ( open circles ) in these fits , and demonstrates why these two nearly identical procedures might give significantly different uncertainties .",
    "the error bars for the field wds are large due to the combined uncertainties in their photometry , trigonometric parallaxes , and the corrections required to transform them to the comparison mass of 0.53 m@xmath33 .",
    "the calibrating wds also appear to form a steeper sequence than the cluster wds .",
    "the steepness and scatter along the sequence is most likely due to small differences in mass ; either real mass differences in the case of the m5 wds , or small errors away from the corrected mass values for the calibrating wds .",
    "it is also possible that some of the m5 wds are he - atmophere wds , in which case they should be 0.02 to 0.07 mag bluer @xcite than the wd calibrating sequence .",
    "we iteratively improved on this preliminary wd distance for m5 by placing the calibrating wds back in the cmd ( see figure [ fig_wdfit]b ) and reselecting the individual wd candidates .",
    "this time , instead of selecting cluster wds based solely on their color , we selected wds based on both magnitude and color .",
    "specifically , we included in the fits all wd candidates whose 1-@xmath36 error ellipses in the cmd overlapped with the sequence defined by the local wd sample .",
    "this two - parameter cut had the effect of dropping the brightest wd candidate and including two other fainter wd candidates .",
    "figure [ fig_wdfit]b shows that it also selected against the stars with questionable photometry .",

    "these improved distances are within the errors of the distances derived initially , and are slightly preferred on sample - selection grounds .",
    "while the agreement of the two values is encouraging , the discrepancy in the uncertainties highlights the sensitivity of the results to the adopted fitting procedure . as a conservative compromise",

    "such problems are common in @xmath5 calibrations like ms fitting where the deep ms photometry and shallow time - series photometry of the rrl are often obtained by different researchers using different detectors , standard stars , etc .    light curves for rrl in m5 are presented in several studies , including brocato , castellani & ripepi ( 1996 , @xmath56 and @xmath14 magnitudes ) ; caputo et al .",

    ", we took the light curves of each star from their original source and recomputed the star s intensity - mean magnitude , @xmath58 , separately in each filter ( @xmath56 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath57 ) .",
    "this entailed converting the individual magnitude estimates in a light curve into intensity estimates , integrating under the phased light curve , and converting the resulting mean intensity back into a magnitude .",
    "we rejected any star with a phase gap large enough to bias the estimate of @xmath58 .",
    "the resulting intensity - mean values are shown in figure [ fig_rrlmag ] as a function of each star s pulsation period .",

    "differences of order 0.02 mag were found , but they appeared to reflect the sub - samples of stars involved more than systematic photometric differences .",
    "we therefore took the @xmath60 values at face value .",
    "if , for a given star , @xmath59 values were available from more than one study , we averaged the values together to get a mean value for the star . in this way , we compiled a list of 79 rrl including 53 rrab and 26 rrc .",
    "figure [ fig_rrlmag]b shows the @xmath61 value for each star plotted against the star s period .",

    "the error estimate reflects the observed scatter in the stellar magnitudes , while a systematic uncertainty of @xmath680.02 mag can be expected in the photometric zeropoint . for comparison , @xcite lists the hb magnitude of m5 to be 15.07 mag .",
    "the lower envelope of the distribution of the points in figure [ fig_rrlmag ] , which should correspond to the zero - age horizontal branch locus , is at @xmath69 mag .",
    "we compiled @xmath56-band data from the three sources listed above .",
    "there were no stars in common between the three studies , so no star - by - star analysis was possible and no systematic zero - point corrections were made .",
    "figure [ fig_rrlmag]a shows the @xmath70 value for each star plotted against the star s period .",
    "the statistics for rrab and rrc considered separately ( see table [ tab_rrlmag ] ) indicate that the rrc stars in m5 are significantly brighter than the rrab stars .",
    "the mean apparent @xmath56-band magnitude of the combined sample of rrl in m5 is @xmath71 mag . as for @xmath14 ,",
    "the error estimate reflects the observed scatter , while a systematic error of @xmath680.02 mag is possible in the photometric zeropoint .",
    "light curves in the @xmath15-band are available only from one source @xcite .",

    ", we fundamentalized the periods of the rrc stars ( log  @xmath72 = log  @xmath73 + 0.13 , @xcite ) , and performed a least squares fit to all the rrl data using an equation of the form @xmath74 line 1 of table [ tab_wasen ] presents the fitted coefficients and their uncertainties , the rms scatter of the points about the fit , and the number of points used in the fit .",
    "this relation may be subject to a systematic zeropoint uncertainty of @xmath680.02 mag .",

    "both @xcite and @xcite provided well - sampled light curves for small numbers of stars ( four and two , respectively ) calibrated to the cit standard system of @xcite .",
    "@xcite took the opposite approach , obtaining only 12 observations per star for 23 separate stars .",
    "this yields a larger sample of stars , but with increased scatter ( rms @xmath75 0.05 mag ) around a true mean relationship due to phase - sampling effects .",
    "also , the @xcite data are not directly calibrated to the @xcite standards , though the authors argue there should be no systematic offset .",
    "figure [ fig_rrlmag]d shows the @xmath76 value for each star plotted against the star s period , and table [ tab_rrlmag ] provides statistics .",
    "there is evidence for discrepancies in the photometric zeropoints of the three studies at the 0.050.10 mag level , though there are too few stars in common to determine any such shifts with accuracy .",
    "normally , the @xmath57-band luminosity of rrl is characterized as a function of period .",
    "the scatter in the @xcite data results in uncertainty in the period - dependence derived from figure [ fig_rrlmag]d . to reduce this uncertainty , we adopt the mean period - dependence ( gradient ) of the eight clusters presented in table 4 of @xcite , and fit it to the @xmath76 data for the four stars with complete light curves using an equation analogous to the one for @xmath77 above .",
    "line 2 of table [ tab_wasen ] shows the results of the fit .",
    "we estimate the systematic uncertainty in the zeropoint of this relation to be @xmath100.07 mag . clearly , well - sampled @xmath57-band light curves for many rrab and rrc in m5 are needed to ensure a definitive @xmath57-band luminosity calibration for m5 .",
    "to obtain a final calibration of the rr lyrae absolute magnitude , @xmath5 , we must combine our distance modulus and apparent magnitudes with interstellar extinction information . from the wd distance analysis",
    ", we obtained an apparent distance modulus of @xmath78 mag , while the main sequence fitting analysis yielded @xmath79 mag .",
    "we are encouraged by the agreement of the results relative to their formal errors .",
    "we combined the two results via a weighted mean , using the inverse - squared errors for the weights , to obtain a single estimate of the apparent distance modulus toward m5 : @xmath80 mag .",
    "clearly , the main sequence fit dominates the combined result .",
    "@xcite advocated the reddening value @xmath81 mag for m5 .",
    "we adopt this value along with a more conservative uncertainty of 0.01 mag , which we believe provides a more realistic assessment of the systematic zeropoint uncertainty in the reddening scale ( see sec .",
    "7.4 of schlegel et al .",
    "this leads to a true distance modulus of @xmath82 mag .",
    "we note that the main sequence fitting result is subject to a small systematic uncertainty due to the zeropoint disagreement between our photometry and that of @xcite .",
    "the wd value was obtained using photometry of the field and m5 wds on the _ hst _ instrumental system , so should not suffer from this uncertainty . if we shift our photometry to match stetson s calibration , the combined distance modulus becomes @xmath83 mag .",
    "using the relations of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 , their table 3 ) in conjunction with our adopted value of @xmath84 mag , we determine the interstellar extinction values to be @xmath85 mag , @xmath86 mag , and @xmath87 mag .",
    "we note that the @xmath15 filter referred to in @xcite has a longer effective wavelength than the kron - cousins @xmath15 filter , to which the _ hst _ photometric transformations are calibrated @xcite . using transmission curves of the ctio @xmath88 filters ,",
    "we obtain @xmath89 and therefore @xmath90 mag in the case of m5 .",
    "note that this relation yields @xmath91 , in good agreement with the kron - cousins reddening relation described by @xcite .",
    "we adopt an increased uncertainty in @xmath92 of 0.02 mag to reflect the uncertainty in the reddening relations .    combining these extinction values with the apparent magnitudes from table [ tab_rrlmag ] and the true distance modulus",
    ", we obtain the absolute magnitudes given in the last column of table [ tab_rrlmag ] , @xmath93 .",
    "we include separate values for rrab and rrc stars .",
    "the calibrations corresponding to lines 1 and 2 of table [ tab_wasen ] , @xmath94 are shown in lines 3 and 4 of that table , in which the quoted errors include the systematic uncertainties due to the distance modulus and to the photometric zeropoints discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_rrlmag ] .",
    "the @xmath93 values in table [ tab_rrlmag ] become 0.04 mag brighter if we adopt the @xcite photometric system .",
    "another approach to representing the luminosity of rr lyrae stars is through the wasenheit functions ( e.g. , kovacs & walker 2001 , cassisi et al . 2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "this reddening - free quantity is especially useful in regions where the reddening is high and varies on small spatial scales .",
    "our high quality distance modulus and rr lyrae photometry for m5 provide an opportunity to derive an empirical calibration of the wasenheit functions .",
    "this is of particular interest since theoretical calibrations have recently become available through the evolution and pulsation modeling of @xcite .",
    "additional empirical calibrations may provide useful feedback to the models .",
    "we follow the studies mentioned above in defining the wasenheit functions @xmath95 and @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the ratio of total absorption to color excess in the appropriate passbands .",
    "while both studies adopt @xmath98 , @xcite employ @xmath99 , while @xcite use 2.54 , and we obtain 2.39 from our analysis of the ctio @xmath88 filter transmission curves .",
    "we also define @xmath100 with @xmath101 for use with our compiled @xmath57-band data set .",
    "each of these apparent values can be converted to an absolute one via our true distance modulus , @xmath102 .",
    "figure [ fig_wasen ] shows the @xmath103 values for our compiled rrl data plotted as a function of fundamentalized pulsation period .",
    "the solid line in each panel indicates the least - squares fits to the data in the form @xmath104 the fitted coefficients and their errors are given in table [ tab_wasen ] along with the rms scatter of the points about the fit , the number of points in the fit , and the adopted value of @xmath97 .",
    "the error in the coefficient @xmath105 is a quadratic combination of the error in the fit ( typically 0.010.03 mag ) and the error in the m5 distance modulus ( 0.10 mag ) .",
    "the values of the @xmath105 coefficient would become 0.04 mag smaller if we employed the distance modulus appropriate to the @xcite photometric zeropoint .",
    "notice that in each panel of figure [ fig_wasen ] , the stars with complete light curves ( solid points ) cluster around the fitted line , while stars with phase gaps in their light curves ( open symbols ) are more often outliers .    in panels ( a ) and",
    "( b ) , the dashed lines indicate the relation predicted by @xcite for their model having metallicity ( @xmath106 ) and horizontal branch type ( + 0.11 ) closest to the observed values for m5 . for @xmath107 ,",
    "our slope is significantly steeper than the predictions ( 2.5@xmath36 ) , while our zeropoint is only 1.6@xmath36 brighter than the predictions owing to systematic uncertainty in the level of the points due to the distance modulus uncertainty .",
    "the star - to - star dispersion is also larger than predicted , suggesting that there may be more star - to - star variation in properties such as stellar mass than is expressed in the models .",
    "we note that the observational work of @xcite found a slope of 2.47 , in better agreement with the models .    for @xmath108",
    ", the agreement between our observations and predictions appears better ( see figure [ fig_wasen]b ) , with the slope and zeropoint deviating by 0.2@xmath36 and 0.6@xmath36 , respectively . if we adopt @xmath109 to match @xcite , the points in figure [ fig_wasen]b shift upward and the slope steepens , giving the fitted coefficients shown in line seven of table [ tab_wasen ] .",
    "still , the agreement is better than with @xmath107 , showing differences from the predictions by only 1.1@xmath36 and 1.3@xmath36 for the slope and zeropoint , respectively .",
    "the scatter is also smaller , in better agreement with the predictions .",
    "the slope of the observed rrl becomes steeper if we convert our intensity magnitudes to the static magnitudes used by the models @xcite .",
    "@xcite discuss the strengths and weaknesses of their models .",
    "they note that the slope predictions derive from the relation between pulsation period and stellar luminosity and effective temperature .",
    "these relatively well - established elements of the modeling should result in slope predictions that are reliable .",
    "meanwhile , the predicted zeropoints depend on elements of the models that are less constrained ( the luminosity of the horizontal branch models and the bolometric corrections ) , so are less secure .",
    "it appears that the input parameters to the models , or perhaps the models themselves , could be adjusted to provide steeper slopes and brighter zeropoints to provide a better match to our observations of m5 .",
    "we have presented deep _ hst _ observations of the globular cluster m5 .",
    "the data reach over eight magnitudes below the main sequence turn - off and include a number of cluster white dwarf stars . by fitting our deep main sequence to a sample of subdwarfs having trigonometric parallaxes",
    ", we obtain an apparent distance modulus of @xmath79 mag , in good agreement with other main sequence fitting solutions for m5 .",
    "if the true metallicity of m5 is different from the adopted value of [ fe / h ] = 1.11 dex , the distance modulus shifts systematically by 0.4 mag / dex .    we also described our approach for selecting a sample of wds with the best quality photometry , and for obtaining a distance estimate to the cluster based on comparison with field wds having trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "the resulting distance modulus , @xmath110 mag , is in good agreement with other estimates for m5 , indicating that our method is reliable .",
    "however , the uncertainty in our wd distance modulus is large compared with the uncertainties associated with more established methods like main sequence fitting .",
    "much of the uncertainty in our wd distance modulus is attributable to the extreme depth of the observations ( @xmath111 mag ) in the wd region , and the correspondingly low signal - to - noise of our wd magnitude and color measurements .",
    "newer instruments on _ hst _ provide better throughput than wfpc2 , so could provide higher signal - to - noise at this magnitude .",
    "we also note that @xmath17 does not offer the best wd sequence for distance estimation ; bluer filters and longer color baselines would result in a wd sequence with a shallower slope .",
    "however , the relatively low blue throughput of wfpc2 demanded that we work in the f814w ( `` @xmath15 '' ) filter for our study .",
    "another advantage the newer _ hst _ instruments have over wfpc2 is their superior spatial resolution , which would provide sextractor with more information to separate wds from critically resolved , blue background galaxies .",
    "three filter photometry would also help in this separation , as it would with separation of cluster wds from blue field subdwarf stars .",
    "finally , a second visit to m5 using wfpc2 or one of the advanced imagers on _ hst _ would provide both higher signal - to - noise magnitudes , and an opportunity to reject field stars and background galaxies using proper motion information @xcite .",
    "observations of additional fields in m5 would provide a larger sample of wds , which would also lead to an improved wd - based distance estimate .",
    "we combined our main sequence and wd results to obtain a best estimate for the true distance modulus of m5 : @xmath112 mag .",
    "this result is weighted strongly toward the main sequence fit result . using this in conjunction with a large sample of rr lyrae magnitudes compiled from the literature",
    ", we obtained a calibration for the rr lyrae absolute magnitude @xmath93 in the @xmath56 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath57 passbands ( see tables [ tab_rrlmag ] and [ tab_wasen ] ) .",
    "our value of @xmath113 mag is brighter than the value of @xmath114 mag advocated by @xcite for [ fe / h ] = 1.11 dex .",
    "this is consistent with their finding that main sequence fitting calibrations tend to be about 0.1 mag brighter than the average value derived from many independent techniques .",
    "the distance modulus obtained from our wd fit alone would yield @xmath5 farther from the @xcite value .",
    "we also presented period - luminosity calibrations in the form of reddening - free wasenheit functions .",
    "these are useful both for distance estimation to heavily reddened systems and for comparison with predictions of recent models that combine evolution and pulsation theories @xcite .",
    "our empirical calibration suggests that the current models predict a period dependence that may be too weak and a luminosity zeropoint that may be too faint",
    ". however , the systematic over - brightness of main sequence fitting @xcite tends to compensate , bringing the theoretical and observed zeropoints into closer agreement .",
    "we conclude that large aperture telescopes with blue - sensitive imagers will enable the wd fitting technique to become increasingly valuable in helping to refine the rr lyrae luminosity calibration , both for m5 and other globular clusters rich in rr lyrae stars .",

    "<S> we present deep @xmath0 photometry of stars in the globular cluster m5 ( ngc  5904 ) based on images taken with the _ hubble space telescope_. the resulting color - magnitude diagram reaches below @xmath1 mag , revealing the upper 23 magnitudes of the white dwarf cooling sequence , and main sequence stars eight magnitudes and more below the turn - off . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the main sequence to subdwarfs of known parallax to obtain a true distance modulus of @xmath2 mag . a second distance estimate based on fitting the cluster white dwarf sequence to field white dwarfs with known parallax yielded @xmath3 mag . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the nature of the difference between the two distance estimates and suggest approaches for reducing the uncertainty in white dwarf fitting estimates for future studies . </S>",
    "<S> we couple our distance estimates with extensive photometry of the cluster s rr lyrae variables to provide a calibration of the rr lyrae absolute magnitude yielding @xmath4 mag at [ fe / h ] = 1.11 dex . </S>",
    "<S> we provide another luminosity calibration in the form of reddening - free wasenheit functions . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of our calibrations with predictions based on recent models combining stellar evolution and pulsation theories shows encouraging agreement , and the existing differences may provide useful feedback to the models . </S>"
