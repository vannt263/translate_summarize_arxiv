    "the continuum emission from hii regions can originate from free - free emission from the ionized gas surrounding ob stars and/or by hot dust heated by nearby stars , while at higher wavelengths such as at 6  cm the radio continuum from such regions is dominated by free - free emission . @xcite measured a flux of 40.4@xmath290.48mjy for g75.78 + 0.34 at 6  cm from vla observations , which can be used to estimate the contribution of free - free emission to the 3.5 mm continuum under an assumption about the shape of the spectral energy distribution of g75.78 + 0.34 .",
    "following @xcite , if we assume a nearly flat spectrum typical of optically thin free - free emission , we would predict a flux of @xmath040mjy for the free - free emission at 3.5 mm and thus the contribution of hot dust would be @xmath080mjy , about two times larger than the contribution of the free - free emission . in the case of the excess at 3.5 mm being only due to dust emission , then the peak flux should increase for lower wavelengths , which is not observed for g75.78 + 0.34 as discussed by @xcite based on measurements of the peak fluxes at 3.5 mm and 2.7 mm ( 111ghz ) .",
    "nevertheless , the discussion above is based on the assumption that g75.78 + 0.34 presents a flat spectrum , which may not be a good approximation of the spectral energy distribution of the region as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "they show that g75.78 + 0.34 presents a spectral index @xmath30 , suggesting that this ultracompact hii is not optically thin , indicating a larger importance of the free - free emission to the millimetric continuum .",

    "they obtained a total flux of 4.73@xmath290.03jy at 20 cm , which is higher than those of the 3.5 mm emission ( 1.73jy ) , indicating that the millimetric continuum emission from this object is due to free - free emission in the ionized gas surrounding the o star .",
    "this conclusion is true , even we assume a negative spectral index of @xmath31 , typical for the high frequencies @xcite at optically thin regions .",
    "a comparison between our 3.5 mm image and the 6 cm continuum image presented by @xcite , for both hii regions , shows that the two images present similar morphologies , suggesting a same origin for the continuum emission .",
    "thus , from this comparison and from the discussion above , we conclude that the 3.5 mm continuum emission from both , g75.78 + 0.34 and g75.77 + 0.34 , ultracompact hii is dominated by free - free emission from the ionized gas surrounding the exciting stars . nevertheless , some contribution of dust emission can not be ruled out for g75.78 + 0.34 .",

    "a comparison of their co images with the hcn flux distributions ( figs .",
    "[ hcn0 - 1 ] , [ hcn2 - 1 ] and [ hcn1 - 1 ] ) shows that they present similar global morphology . in the case of g75.78 +",
    "0.34 we can also compare the hcn images with the co images presented by @xcite , using higher spatial resolution bima observations than those reached by @xcite .",
    "their image present two  jet - like \" structures , one to east of the ultracompact hii region and the other to north of it , similarly to those observed in the hcn emission , although the hcn jets are less extended than the co ones and present some knots of higher intensity levels ( more clearly seen in the f=21 image ) , which are not present in the co image .",
    "the similarity between these images suggests that the co and hcn traces the same physical properties .",
    "nevertheless , the smaller extension of the jets and the high emission knots in the hcn images indicate that its emission traces higher density structures than the ones traced by the co emission , in good agreement with previous studies , which found that the j=10 transition from the hcn molecule is a tracer of dense cores with densities in the range @xmath15 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "besides the hcn flux distribution , its emission origin is one of the most important questions in the study of molecular cores .",
    "the populations of the various molecular levels are determined by the physical parameters of the gas ( temperature , density , velocity ) and the intensity of each hyperfine component may be also affected by radiative transfer effects .",
    "thus , the hcn hyperfine line ratios can be used to investigate the physical properties of the emitting gas . in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) the predicted theoretical values for the hyperfine line ratios for hcn(j=10 ) are @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xcite . as observed in table 1 the intensity ratios ,",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 , differ from the predicted lte values for both hii regions . for g75.77 + 0.34",

    "differences between the intensity ratios observed and predicted are commonly reported in the literature and known as the hyperfine anomaly @xcite .",
    "two scenarios have been proposed to explain this anomaly .",
    "the thermal model developed by @xcite suggests that the overlap of the j=21 hyperfine transitions overpopulates the state j=1 , f=2 , and thus the line j=10 , f=21 grows relative to the other lines . with the growing temperature",
    ", the ratios @xmath36 and @xmath37 become smaller than the lte values .",
    "this model provides a reasonable explanation for the observed ratios in hot clouds .",
    "the second scenario , proposed by @xcite , suggests that the relative intensities of hcn hyperfine transitions are formed by scattering of the radiation emitted from the cloud core to the surrounding envelope .",
    "the optically - thick lines ( f=21 and f=11 ) are scattered more often than the optically - thin line ( f=01 ) , and thus the line f=01 is enhanced relative to the other lines .    the scattering scenario have been invoked to explain the intensity ratios observed in ultracompact hii regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and could explain the emission from g75.78 + 0.34 and g75.77 + 0.34 .",
    "this suggestion is supported by the distinct flux distributions observed for each hyperfine transition from both hii regions ( see figs.[hcn1 - 1 ] , [ hcn2 - 1 ] and [ hcn0 - 1 ] ) . for g75.78 + 0.34 ,",
    "the flux distribution for f=01 is the most concentrated , followed by f=11 and f=21 , for which the scattering of the radiation emitted from the cloud core is more important . in the case of g75.77 + 0.34 the @xmath37 is smaller than the predicted for lte , which favors the thermal model in which the intensity of f=21 grows relative to the other lines .",
    "thus , numerical models and higher spatial resolution line ratio maps are necessary to properly distinguish between both scenarios for both hii regions .      as discussed in sec.[hcn_flux ] , the hcn(j=10 ) and @xmath32co(j=10 ) flux distributions are similar for g75.78 + 0.34 . from the velocity channels ( figs.[channel0 - 1 ]",
    ", [ channel2 - 1 ] , [ channel1 - 1 ] ) we can investigate the kinematics of the hcn emitting gas and compare it with the co kinematics presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these works found bipolar molecular outflows associated with the ultracompact hii region , with the blueshifted emitting gas presenting sub - structures elongated to north and to east from the peak flux position and the redshifted gas being more elongated to south - west of it .",
    "a detailed analysis of the hcn velocity channels reveals that the blueshifted hcn emission is dominated by the two  jet - like \" structures described above.the peak of redshifted hcn emission is a bit displaced to south relative to the peak position of the blueshifted emission and the highest velocity channels present an additional structure extended to south - west .",
    "these kinematic components are similar to those observed in @xmath32co(j=10 ) indicating that at least part of the hcn emitting gas follow the bipolar molecular outflows observed in co.    in the case of g75.77 + 0.34 there are no velocity channel maps with similar resolution to ours for the co emission in the literature and thus a comparison between the hcn and co kinematics is not possible here .",
    "the flux distribution of all channel maps are similar , with exception of the highest velocity channels , which show three knots oriented to south - west of the position of the peak emission , indicating that dense molecular outflows are less important for this object than for the case of g75.78 + 0.34 .",
    "we analyzed 3.5  mm continuum and hcn(j=10 ) line emission from the hii regions g75.78 + 0.34 and g75.77 + 0.34 from interferometric observations obtained with the bima array in d configuration .",

    "the main results of this work are :    * the the 3.5  mm continuum emission is consistent with the free - free emission from the ionized gas from the hii regions .",
