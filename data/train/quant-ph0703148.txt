    "after their first experimental realization @xcite , bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) have stimulated an enormous amount of theoretical investigations .",
    "especially the recent progress in confining and manipulating becs @xcite affords an opportunity to realize a variety of quantum mechanical models experimentally .",
    "since a full many particle treatment of becs is only possible for a small number of atoms , such systems are mostly described in the celebrated mean - field approximation , which describes the system quite well for large particle numbers at low temperatures .",
    "most previous studies focused on relatively simple models like the two - mode system in order to investigate the correspondence between many particle and mean - field description @xcite .",
    "most interestingly , the mean - field description as a large particle number limit of many particle systems is formally related to the usual classical limit of quantum mechanics . in a number of recent papers consequences of the classical nature of the mean - field approximation",
    "are discussed and semiclassical aspects are introduced @xcite . for a two - mode system even the eigenenergies and eigenstates of the many particle system could be reconstructed approximately from the mean - field system in a wkb type manner with astonishing accuracy @xcite .",
    "recent experiments with a relatively small number of particles @xcite offer the opportunity to study the interplay of classical and genuine quantum behavior .    within the theory of quantum chaos systems with",
    "a periodic time dependence play an important role . despite their apparently academic character systems with a delta - type time dependence",
    "are of particular relevance .",
    "their prominence is not only due to their relatively simple handling in theory , but first of all to their typical behavior .",
    "therefore systems like the kicked rotor or the kicked top became standard models in this area @xcite .    in the present paper we focus on an @xmath1-particle bec in a double - well trap with a periodically kicked interaction strength . experimentally the particle interaction may be modulated via a feshbach resonance , a simpler realization , however , can be achieved by kicking the single particle tunneling coupling instead by varying the optical potential .",
    "as we will see later , these two systems are equivalent in the case of a symmetric double - well . in a two - mode approximation",
    "such a system can be described by a two - site bose - hubbard type hamiltonian . in the case of a symmetric trap",
    "this system is in fact a realization of a kicked top studied , e.g. , by haake _",
    "et al . _  in the context of quantum chaos @xcite . considering this bec context , the question if the kicked top could be realized experimentally @xcite can be answered in a novel way which offers the opportunity to study aspects of the system which were not investigated in the past .",
    "one of the most prominent features of the corresponding time independent system is the so called self - trapping effect @xcite . above a critical value of the interaction strength , the system properties change qualitatively and unbalanced solutions appear , favoring one of the wells . a careful discussion of this effect , the relation between mean - field and @xmath1-particle behavior as well as its control by external driving fields can be found in @xcite . in the many particle system self - trapping",
    "is suppressed by tunneling oscillations . the same effects are also present in the kicked system . in that case",
    "the dynamics of the many particle system is much richer .",
    "in fact a hole bunch of prominent features of quantum dynamical systems like coherent destruction of tunneling and chaos assisted tunneling can be found in this model .    in the following section we present the basic model and give a short review of the floquet formalism . in section [ sec_mf ]",
    "we investigate the mean - field dynamics and compare it to the much richer many particle dynamics in section [ sec_mp ] .",
    "we conclude the paper with a detailed discussion of the tunneling behavior .",
    "we focus on a two - site bose - hubbard system with the hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 are bosonic particle annihilation and creation operators for the @xmath5th mode , @xmath6 is the on - site energy difference , @xmath7 controls the single particle tunneling and @xmath8 the interaction strength . the hamiltonian commutes with the number operator @xmath9 so that the total number of particles @xmath1 is conserved .",
    "it is convenient to introduce angular momentum operators according to the schwinger representation @xmath10 which obey the @xmath11 commutation relations @xmath12={\\rm i}l_k$ ] , where @xmath13 and cyclic permutations .",
    "the angular momentum quantum number is equal to @xmath14 . in terms of these operators",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) assumes the form @xmath15    as already discussed in the introduction , we now consider a periodically kicked system , in particular the case of a kicked interaction strength @xmath16 i.e.  the time - periodic hamiltonian @xmath17 in the symmetric case @xmath18 this is in fact the hamiltonian of a kicked top @xcite .",
    "a similar system with kicked single particle tunneling coupling @xmath7 has been studied in @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the benefit of a kicked system is the enormous simplification of the dynamics .",
    "the mean - field approximation , for example , can be evaluated in closed form as outlined in section [ sec_mf ] .    since the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) is periodic in time , @xmath19 , it is useful to introduce the propagator over one period , the so called floquet - operator @xmath20\\ ] ] where the operator @xmath21 takes care of the right time order .",
    "the floquet - operator ( [ floq ] ) is by definition unitary and thus has unimodular eigenvalues @xmath22 the @xmath23 quasi - energies @xmath24 are the natural counterparts of the energies of time - independent systems .",
    "we choose @xmath24 in the first brillouin - zone @xmath25 .",
    "the eigenstates of the floquet - operator , the so called floquet - states @xmath26 , form an orthonormal basis of the hilbert space and obey @xmath27    for the @xmath0-type time dependence the floquet - operator factorizes @xmath28 similar expressions would be obtained by modulating the single particle tunneling coupling @xmath7 and the on - site energy difference @xmath6 with periodic @xmath0-kicks instead of the particle interaction @xmath8 . in this case",
    "one would arrive at a floquet - operator @xmath29 where the order of the two exponential factors of ( [ floq2 ] ) is switched .",
    "the stroboscopic dynamics induced by iterations of the floquet - operator , however , is not changed .    the additional symmetry ( in the symmetric case for @xmath18 )",
    "can be expressed via an invariance under rotations @xmath30 around the @xmath31-axis about @xmath32 .",
    "the floquet - operator commutes with @xmath33 , @xmath34 = 0,\\ ] ] and the floquet states can be separated into two symmetry classes , one even and one odd under the rotation @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath1 is even , the angular momentum quantum number @xmath35 is an integer .",
    "thus we have @xmath36 and the eigenvalues of @xmath33 are @xmath37 . equation ( [ k3_eigenwertgl ] ) can be reformulated according to @xmath38 where @xmath39 if @xmath1 is odd @xmath40 holds , since @xmath35 is half an integer .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath33 then are @xmath41 .",
    "this yields as well two classes of floquet states @xmath42 , which obey @xmath43 these two symmetry classes will be of importance for the tunneling process investigated in the following .",
    "the celebrated mean - field approximation can be achieved by replacing the field operators by complex numbers @xmath44 note , however , that the mapping ( [ k1_ersetzung ] ) is not well - defined , since complex numbers commute in contrast to operators .",
    "therefore , the operators should be rewritten in symmetrized form in @xmath3 and @xmath45 before the replacement ( [ k1_ersetzung ] ) is carried out @xcite . here",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) is already symmetric , however the number operator ( [ num ] ) appears as @xmath46 and the mean - field wave function is normalized according to @xmath47 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is in fact a classical limit of the system , equivalent to the limit @xmath48 , where the parameter @xmath49 takes over the role of an effective planck constant @xcite . in the case of the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) this leads to a hamiltonian function @xmath50 of the conjugate variables @xmath51 and @xmath52 which obey the classical canonical equations of motion @xmath53    the dynamics of such a system can be equivalently put in the form of a discrete gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , or discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation , in terms of the nonlinear matrix equation @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the population imbalance of the two wells .",
    "the dynamics described by this equation of motion conserves the norm of the wave function and can be conveniently visualized by a mapping onto the bloch sphere : similar to ( [ l ] ) , one can define the three quantities @xmath56 the components of the bloch vector @xmath57 .",
    "the norm of the bloch vector @xmath58 is determined by the normalization of the mean - field wave function .",
    "writing the gpe ( [ gpe ] ) in terms of the bloch vector yields the nonlinear bloch equations @xmath59 for the periodically kicked system ( [ h ] ) one can , as in the many particle case , define a floquet operator @xmath60 for the mean - field bloch vector . here again the floquet operator factorizes : for @xmath61 the dynamics is linear and can be solved in closed form .",
    "the resulting time evolution can be described by a matrix @xmath62 a rotation about the axis @xmath63 with frequency @xmath64 this rotation is followed by a kick , which conserves the @xmath65-component @xmath66 , described by the torsion matrix @xmath67 the full mean - field dynamics therefore reads @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 .    in the following numerical studies we will consider a symmetric system ( @xmath18 ) .",

    ", chaotic regions appear in the vicinity of the unstable fixed point .",
    "the two regular islands will be of special interest in the following , since they correspond to the famous self - trapping states of the non - kicked system as they are localized on the northern and southern hemisphere , respectively .",
    "unlike the non - kicked system , self - trapping occurs only in a certain regime , since increasing @xmath8 even further leads inevitably to global chaos .",

    "the critical value of the parameter @xmath8 for the occurrence of self - trapping , i.e.  the point of bifurcation of the prominent fixed point @xmath84 , can be calculated in dependence on the other system parameters by linearization . to guarantee stability of the fixed point @xmath81",
    "the interaction strength must obey the inequalities @xmath85 thus , for parameters @xmath86 , this fixed point is stable for @xmath87 .",

    "this yields @xmath190 in perfect agreement with the numerical propagation .    to achieve a better understanding of the behavior of the quasi - energies , especially crossing or avoided crossing scenarios in regions where the levels really get close to each other",
    ", one needs to examine their dependence on continuous variables , e.g. , the kick strength @xmath8 .",
    "of special interest is the role of the third chaotic state .",
    "one has to keep in mind , however , that the mean - field phase space structure changes by varying @xmath8 ; especially both of the regular islands are modified .",
    "at first we take a look at the tunneling time @xmath169 as a function of @xmath8 where we leave the number of particles @xmath184 fixed .",
    "calculated according to ( [ k4_tunnelzeit ] ) with the help of @xmath161 as a function of @xmath8 for a fixed number of @xmath181 particles , @xmath18 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 ; cdt : coherent destruction of tunneling divergences , cat : chaos assisted tunneling resonances , in the regions of the small gaps the two state approximation breaks down . ]",
    "this plot , shown in figure [ figure : tunnel_c_1 - 1_3 - 1_n_30 ] , provides similar features as seen for the @xmath1-dependence in figure [ figure : tunnelzeit_c_2_n_0_150 ] . for higher values of @xmath8 there",
    "exist the same kind of cat resonances as seen in the @xmath1 dependence above , where the tunneling period decreases by several orders of magnitude .",
    "they are due to avoided crossing scenarios of the quasi - energy levels , which shall be examined in more detail in the following .     for @xmath184 particles , @xmath18 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 as a function of @xmath8 ; @xmath171 tunneling doublet @xmath146 ; ( cdt ) : real crossing of @xmath146 inducing cdt ; ( cat ) : avoided crossing with a chaotic level inducing cat , see text for details . ]    in figure [ figure : kreuzung00 ] we show the quasi - energies over the interaction strength @xmath8 for @xmath184 particles ( note the cylindrical topology ; due to the definition of the quasi - energies @xmath191 and @xmath32 have to be identified on the @xmath192-axis ) .",
    "let us focus on the prominent resonance at @xmath193 corresponding to the region marked by cat in the figure .",
    "a magnification of this region is shown in figure [ figure : kreuzung1 ] .    ;",
    "the symmetry of the quasi - energy levels are denoted by @xmath194 ; one observes an avoided crossing of the quasi - energy levels with @xmath195-symmetry ; @xmath171 tunneling doublet @xmath146 . ]    here one of the levels of the doublet undergoes an avoided crossing with a chaotic third level @xmath172 ( since they belong to the same symmetry class ) .",
    "the splitting of the avoided crossing is in the same order of magnitude as the splitting of the tunneling doublet .",
    "hence , in an intermediate region the three states @xmath145 and @xmath175 all take part in a three state tunneling mechanism .",
    "the simple two state model breaks down here and the tunneling time can not be evaluated according to ( [ k4_tunnelzeit ] ) ( note the small gaps in the graph in figure [ figure : tunnel_c_1 - 1_3 - 1_n_30 ] ) . due to",
    "the strongly avoided crossing the splitting of the tunneling doublet increases , when the third state approaches , which causes a significant decrease of the tunneling time .",
    "an illustration of this stimulated tunneling process , cat , can be found in @xcite .    comparing figure [ figure : tunnel_c_1 - 1_3 - 1_n_30 ] and [ figure : kreuzung00 ]",
    "it becomes obvious that apart from these resonant avoided crossing events there is a large number of avoided crossings which have no significant influence on the tunneling period .",
    "the avoided crossing between the third level and one of the doublet levels has only a very small splitting in these cases , which has no influence on the tunneling period , since the quasi - energy doublet stays almost undistorted .    despite the cat resonance",
    "there is another structure in figure [ figure : tunnel_c_1 - 1_3 - 1_n_30 ] which attracts attention : while for small values of @xmath8 the tunneling period increases faster than exponential and shows an almost monotonic behavior , a sharp peak can be observed for @xmath196 which in fact is a true divergence .",
    "this phenomenon is known as `` coherent destruction of tunneling '' ( cdt ) @xcite . at these points in parameter space the two levels belonging to the tunneling doublet cross .",
    "since they have different parity such crossings are not forbidden .",
    "this zero splitting automatically leads to a divergence in the tunneling period .",
    "thus , the relatively high value of the tunneling period that can be observed in figure [ figure : tunnelzeit_c_2_n_0_150 ] for @xmath184 particles is due to the direct neighborhood to the cdt divergence in parameter space .",
    "a diverging tunneling time means in fact total suppression of the dynamical many particle tunneling and therefore a real self - trapping of the condensate not only in the mean - field approximation , but also in the full many particle regime .",
    "let us finally explore the whole parameter space available for a symmetric two - mode system .",
    "one system parameter is the interatomic interaction strength @xmath8 , the second parameter is the time scale of the system , which is given by the single particle tunneling coupling @xmath7 .",
    "both of the effects cdt and cat are governed by the behavior of the quasi - energies in dependence on the system parameters , which in turn is ruled by the symmetries of the system .",
    "these are mappings under which the eigenvalues and symmetry properties of @xmath197 are preserved ; for the floquet operator ( [ floq ] ) they are given by orthogonal matrices .",
    "therefore @xmath197 has codimension @xmath198 , which means that at least two system parameters have to be varied to enforce a degeneracy of two quasi - energies belonging to the same symmetry class @xcite .",
    "hence accidental degeneracies of such quasi - energy planes @xmath199 occur at most at isolated points in the parameter space spanned by @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "however , planes belonging to _ different _ symmetry classes , i.e.  having opposite parity , actually exhibit exact crossings which form a one dimensional manifold in the @xmath200-plane .",
    "thus , the quasi - energy planes @xmath199 cross along lines ( * ? ? ? * sect .",
    "these lines play an important role in the context of tunneling since the tunneling period @xmath169 diverges there .",
    "plotting @xmath169 as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath7 yields the `` tunneling landscape '' of the kicked double - well bec .",
    "figure [ figure : landsc0 ] shows @xmath201 in false color representation on a logarithmic scale .     over @xmath200 in false color representation on logarithmic scale ; @xmath184 particles , @xmath18 and @xmath75 .",
    "the sharp dark lines with reduced tunneling times represent cat regions whereas these with high values of the tunneling time represent cdt regions . ]",
    "one observes indeed a rich landscape with diversified sequences of ridges and valleys .",
    "the sharp lines with small values of the tunneling period ( dark blue ) correspond to the cat regions ; along these lines avoided crossings of the quasi - energy planes with significant splitting occur . on the other hand ,",
    "the sharp lines with high values of @xmath169 are actually lines of divergence since the quasi - energy planes intersect along these lines in parameter space .",
    "thus , they correspond to the cdt regions . in the upper left corner of the presented section of parameter space ,",
    "i.e. , for smaller values of @xmath8 and larger values of @xmath7 , regular dynamics prevails and almost no crossings of the quasi - energy planes take place .",
    "the consequence of this is a flat tunneling landscape area .",
    "the opposite holds in the chaotic regime ; here a larger number of cat resonances and cdt divergences occur .",
    "remarkable are the `` avoided crossings '' between both the ridges and the valleys of the landscape .",
    "one of these is shown in figure [ figure : landsc1 ] which is a magnification of figure [ figure : landsc0 ] .    ; avoided crossing of two cdt ridges , in the gap one observes a cat valley . ]",
    "a systematical feature at these crossings is the direct neighborhood of resonances and divergences which could already be observed in figure [ figure : tunnel_c_1 - 1_3 - 1_n_30 ] that is actually a cut through figure [ figure : landsc0 ] at @xmath74 .",
    "another interesting fact about this tunneling landscape is , that in principle the system can be tuned to the cdt regime by adjusting one parameter .",
    "thus for this kicked system real self - trapping is possible not only in the mean - field regime , but also for the full quantum system and the system can be tuned from enforced tunneling to this regime by rather slight variations of the parameters .",
    "this yields the possibility of a systematic and accurate population transfer between the two potential wells .",
    "in the present paper we investigated a two - mode bec with a periodically kicked interaction term in a many particle as well as in a mean - field description . this system is actually equivalent to the kicked top which is a standard example of quantum chaos . besides the new possible experimental realization of the kicked top",
    ", this new context sheds light on different aspects of the model .",
    "we showed that the tunneling oscillations of the many particle system which usually suppress the self - trapping effect show a rich spectrum of phenomena like coherent destruction of tunneling and chaos assisted tunneling .",
    "the sensitive parameter dependence of the tunneling behavior of the system offers an interesting tool for the manipulation of bose - einstein condensates ."
