    "shortest curves and graphs with given properties on surfaces have been much studied in the recent computational topology literature ; a lot of effort has been devoted towards efficient algorithms for finding shortest curves that simplify the topology of the surface , or shortest topological decompositions of surfaces  @xcite ( refer also to the recent surveys  @xcite ) .",
    "these objects provide `` canonical '' simplifications or decompositions of surfaces , which turn out to be crucial for algorithm design in the case of surface - embedded graphs , where making the graph planar is needed  @xcite , as well as for many purposes in computer graphics and mesh processing  @xcite .    in this article , we study inequalities that relate the size of a triangulated surface with the length of such shortest curves and graphs embedded thereon .",
    "the model parameter that we study is the notion of _ edge - width _ of an ( unweighted ) graph embedded on a surface  @xcite , that is , the length of a shortest closed walk in the graph that is non - contractible on the surface ( i.e. , can not be deformed to a single point on the surface ) .",
    "in particular we are interested in the following question : what is the largest possible edge - width , over all triangulations with @xmath2  triangles of an orientable surface of genus  @xmath1 without boundary ?",
    "it was known  @xcite that @xmath4 is an upper bound for the edge - width , and we prove that this bound is asymptotically tight , namely , that some combinatorial surfaces of arbitrarily large genus achieve this bound .",
    "we also study similar questions for other types of curves ( non - separating closed curves , null - homologous but non - contractible closed curves ) and for decompositions ( pants decompositions , and cut graphs with a prescribed combinatorial map ) , and give an algorithm to compute short pants decompositions .",
    "most of our results build upon or extend to a discrete setting some known theorems in _ riemannian systolic geometry _ , the archetype of which is an upper bound on the systole ( the length of a shortest non - contractible closed curve  a continuous version of the edge - width ) in terms of the square root of the area of a riemannian surface without boundary ( or more generally the @xmath5th root of the volume of an essential riemannian @xmath5-manifold ) .",
    "riemannian systolic geometry  @xcite was pioneered by loewner and pu  @xcite , reaching its maturity with the deep work of gromov  @xcite . in thurston",
    "s words , topology is naked and it _ dresses _ with geometric structures ; systolic geometry regards the lengths and areas of all those possible outfits . similarly , endowing a topological surface with a triangulation",
    "is a way to `` dress '' it and much of this paper leverages on comparing these two types of outfits .",
    "we always assume that the surface has _ no boundary _ , that the underlying graph of the combinatorial surface is a _ triangulation _ , and that its edges are _ unweighted _ ; the curves and graphs we seek remain on the edges of the triangulation .",
    "lifting any of these restrictions invalidates or significantly worsens our bounds .",
    "in many natural situations , such requirements hold , such as in geometric modeling and computer graphics , where triangular meshes of surfaces without boundary are typical and , in many cases , the triangles have bounded aspect ratio ( which immediately implies that our bounds apply , the constant in the @xmath6 notation depending on the aspect ratio ) .",
    "after the preliminaries ( section  [ s : prelim ] ) , we prove three independent results ( sections [ s : alfredo][s : eric ] ) , which are described and related to other works below .",
    "this paper is organized so as to showcase the more conceptual results before the more technical ones .",
    "indeed , the results of section  [ s : alfredo ] exemplify the strength of the connection with riemannian geometry , while the results in sections  [ s : arnaud ] and  [ s : eric ] are perhaps a bit more specific , but feature deeper algorithmic and combinatorial tools .",

    "these upper bounds are new , except for the non - contractible case , which was proved by hutchinson  @xcite with a worse constant in the @xmath6 notation .",
    "the optimality of these inequalities is also new .",
    "actually , hutchinson  @xcite had conjectured that the correct upper bound was @xmath7 ; przytycka and przytycki refuted her conjecture , building , in a series of papers  @xcite , examples that show a lower bound of @xmath8 .",
    "they conjectured in 1993  @xcite that the correct bound was @xmath4 ; here , we confirm this conjecture .    in appendix",
    "[ a : hd ] , we observe that the proofs of the results mentioned above extend to higher dimensions",
    ". however , the situation is not quite as symmetrical as in the two - dimensional case : it turns out that discrete systolic inequalities in terms of the number of vertices or facets imply continuous systolic inequalities , and that continuous systolic inequalities imply discrete systolic inequalities only in terms of the number of facets .",
    "this allows us to derive that a systolic inequality in terms of the number of facets holds for every triangulation of an essential manifold .",
    "as pointed out to us by a referee , slight variations of the results of section  [ s : alfredo ] and appendix  [ a : hd ] were simultaneously and independently discovered by ryan kowalick in his ph.d.thesis  @xcite .",

    "we can obtain a similar result in the case of polyhedral triangulations , namely , metric spaces obtained by gluing @xmath2  equilateral euclidean triangles with sides of unit length .",
    "we first note that an element of @xmath251 naturally corresponds to a polyhedral triangulation by gluing equilateral triangles of unit side length on the vertices .",
    "the notion of @xmath36-systole is defined similarly in this setting , and we now prove that theorem  [ t : gpy - cutgraphs ] implies an analogous result for polyhedral triangulations :    [ t : gpy - cutgraphs - polyhedral ] given strictly positive real numbers @xmath48 and  @xmath135 , and integers @xmath252 and  @xmath253 , there exist @xmath254 and @xmath255 such that , for any combinatorial map  @xmath36 of a cellular graph embedding with genus  @xmath1 , with probability at least @xmath256 , a polyhedral triangulation chosen uniformly at random from @xmath251 has @xmath36-systole at least @xmath249 .      [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     for ( ii ) and ( ii ) , the basic idea is to use a similar exchange argument as to prove  ( i ) , but we need a perturbation argument as well .",
    "specifically , let us temporarily perturb the crossing weights of the edges of  @xmath42 as follows : the weight of each edge  @xmath35 of  @xmath42 becomes  @xmath257 , where the @xmath258 s are real numbers that are linearly independent over  @xmath259 ( e.g. , independent and identically distributed random ) and strictly between @xmath260 and  @xmath261 .",
    "let @xmath162 be a shortest embedded graph with combinatorial map",
    "@xmath36 under this perturbed metric .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath162 is also a shortest embedding with combinatorial map @xmath36 under the unweighted metric : indeed , two cut graphs @xmath262 and  @xmath263 with respective ( integer ) lengths @xmath264 in the unweighted metric have respective lengths @xmath265 in the perturbed metric , since the perturbation increases the length of each edge by less than  @xmath261 .    we claim that either ( ii ) or  ( ii )  holds for this choice of  @xmath162 .",
    "assume that ( ii )  does not hold ; we prove that ( ii )  holds .",
    "so the region  @xmath266 of  @xmath99 between two parallel chords @xmath267 and  @xmath268 of  @xmath99 contains internal vertices ; without loss of generality ( by  ( i ) ) , assume that the region  @xmath266 contains no other chord in its interior .",
    "let @xmath269 and  @xmath270 be the two subpaths of the cut graph on the boundary of  @xmath266 .",
    "if @xmath269 and  @xmath270 have different lengths under the perturbed metric , e.g. , @xmath269 is shorter , then we can push the part of  @xmath270 to let it run along  @xmath269 and shorten the cut graph ( figure  [ f : count - schemas - detail-2](b ) ) , which is a contradiction .",
    "therefore , @xmath269 and  @xmath270 have the same length under the perturbed metric , which implies that they cross exactly the same set  @xmath271 of edges of  @xmath42 , since the weights are linearly independent over  @xmath259 .",
    "( we exclude from  @xmath271 the edges on the endpoints of  @xmath269 and  @xmath270 . )",

    "this concludes the proof of the claim .",
    "we now estimate the number of possible combinatorial maps for  @xmath272 , by `` splitting '' it into two connected plane graphs @xmath273 and @xmath274 , estimating all possibilities of choosing each of these graphs , and estimating the number of ways to combine them .",

    "since the chords are non - crossing and connect distinct sides of  @xmath99 , the pairs of sides connected by at least one chord form a subset of a triangulation of the polygon having one vertex per side of  @xmath99 . to describe  @xmath274",
    ", it therefore suffices to describe a triangulation of this polygon with at most @xmath278 edges , which makes @xmath279 possibilities , and to describe , for each of the @xmath280 edges of the triangulation , the number of parallel chords connecting the corresponding pair of sides .",
    "since there are at most @xmath281  chords , the number of possibilities for these numbers equals @xmath282 , which is the number of weak compositions of @xmath281 into @xmath283 parts , namely @xmath284 the inequality being standard ( or following from stirling s formula ) .",
    "finally , in how many ways can we combine given @xmath273 and  @xmath274 to form  @xmath272 ?",
    "let us first assume that ( ii )  holds ; the parallel chords joining the same pair of sides are consecutive , so choosing the position of a single chord fixes the position of the other chords parallel to it .",
    "therefore , given @xmath273 , we need to count in how many ways we can insert the @xmath15 vertices of  @xmath275 on  @xmath274 into  @xmath273 , and similarly the @xmath15 intervals where endpoints of chords can occur , respecting the cyclic ordering .",
    "after choosing the position of a distinguished vertex of  @xmath274 , we have to choose @xmath15 positions on the edges of the boundary of  @xmath273 , possibly with repetitions , which leaves us with @xmath285 possibilities . in case",
    "( ii ) holds , a very similar argument gives the same result .",
    "the claimed bound follows by multiplying the number of all possible choices above : there are @xmath286 choices for the distinguished half - edge of the outer face of  @xmath272 , @xmath277 choices for  @xmath273 , @xmath287 choices for  @xmath274 , and @xmath277 possibilities for combining @xmath273 and  @xmath274 .",

    "we report the results and open problems that we can derive by generalizing our techniques for surfaces .      to infer discrete systolic inequalities from the riemannian ones , the obvious approach is , as before , to start with a triangulated manifold @xmath327 and to endow  @xmath36 with a metric @xmath336 by deciding that each simplex of  @xmath86 is a regular euclidean simplex of volume one .",
    "( since the simplices are regular , we glue them by facewise isometries . ) hence , length and volume are naturally defined via the restriction to each euclidean simplex .",
    "following gromov  @xcite , we will call such a metric a _ piecewise riemannian metric_. unlike the 2-dimensional case , however , foundational work of kervaire  @xcite shows that in higher dimensions such a triangulated manifold is not always smoothable .",
