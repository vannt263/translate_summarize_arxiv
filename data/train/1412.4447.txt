    "secondly , a variational monte carlo study has been performed for the similar two - band model @xcite , where a nodal @xmath70-wave state is found to be more stable than the @xmath159 state for finite @xmath155 ( a - b sublattice energy offset ) .",
    "if that is the case , the gap will be nodal on the fermi surface and inconsistent with the experiment .",
    "thirdly , this mechanism relies on the peculiar features of the honeycomb lattice , so that it can not be applied to the @xmath4-form materials ( see section 5 ) , automatically implying that the pairing mechanisms of the two phases are different . and",
    "finally , it is again difficult to theoretically reproduce the @xmath2 enhancement in the lightly doped regime @xcite .    as for the nmr , since 1/@xmath162 measures i m @xmath163 in the @xmath164 limit , there is a possibility that the finite energy spin fluctuations that are not detected in the nmr may be responsible for superconductivity . on the other hand ,",
    "a more straightforward interpretation of course is that the spin fluctuation does not play a major role in the pairing . even if that is the case",
    ", @xmath159 pairing is still a tempting possibility as an explanation for seemingly contradicting observations .",
    "then , it would be interesting to look into the possibility of such pairing owing to fluctuations other than the spin fluctuation .",
    "such a possibility could be investigated in more realistic models which consider not only on - site but also off - site electron - electron interactions as well as more realistic band structures with more than just two bands .",
    "regarding the @xmath2 enhancement in the lightly doped regime , apart from the microscopic pairing mechanism , the system approaching the anderson localization may be playing some role in the enhancement of @xmath2 , as suggested by several authors @xcite .",
    "the anderson localization scenario may also account for the absence of the coherence peak @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the relatively high @xmath2 as well as the absence of the coherence peak holds even in the largely doped regime , where the localization effect is expected to be weak , so once again puzzles remain .",

    "<S> the parent compounds are band insulators with no discernible long - range ordered state . upon doping tiny amount of electrons , </S>",
    "<S> superconductivity emerges with several anomalous features beyond the conventional electron - phonon mechanism , which stimulate theoretical investigations . </S>",
