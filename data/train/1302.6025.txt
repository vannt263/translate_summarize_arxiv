    "recently , it has been shown that kaon photoproduction process provides an important tool for investigating missing resonances , the resonances predicted by constituent quark models but not observed yet by the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite .",
    "the relatively small decay widths to pion - nucleon channel are believed to be the reason behind this fact .",
    "however , certain constituent quark models @xcite predict that these resonances have larger decay widths to other channels , such as kaon - hyperon ones .",
    "thus , kaon photoproduction is well suited to shed more light on the existence of these missing resonances .",
    "whereas nucleon resonances have been intensively investigated by using kaon photoproduction , there has been no thorough study on hyperon resonances by means of this process .",
    "ideally , such a study should be performed by using the kaon - nucleon scattering , in which hyperon resonances propagate in the @xmath5-channel .",
    "furthermore , kaon - nucleon scattering experiment has become the main focus of recent experimental activities at jparc in japan @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in order to achieve an accuracy similar to that obtained in experiments using electromagnetic beams performed at jefferson lab , mami , and spring8 , one needs very intense kaon beam .",
    "moreover , it is widely understood that hadronic interaction is not as  clean  as the electromagnetic one . in view of this",
    ", kaon photoproduction could offer a complementary solution , since the hyperon resonance propagates in the @xmath6-channel and , therefore , the process is sensitive to certain observables at backward kaon scattering angles .",
    "more than a decade ago it was found that the second peak in the cross section of saphir data @xcite can be nicely reproduced by including a missing @xmath7 nucleon resonance in a covariant isobar model .",
    "an isobar model which includes this resonance and hadronic form factors was fitted to the saphir data .",
    "the form factor cut - off @xmath8 was allowed to vary during the fitting process and it was found that @xmath9 gev . although there is no tool to measure this form factor directly , since it is an off - shell form factor , such a small cut - off was considered to be unreasonably soft @xcite and the form factors were considered as an artificial mechanism required just to suppress the diverging born terms at high energies . instead of using this resonance and an artificial cut - off , ref .",
    "@xcite proposed to use @xmath4 and @xmath2 , which were claimed to have the same ability to suppress the born terms , while simultaneously to keep the form factor sufficiently `` hard '' .",
    "since the number of experimental data at present is almost one order of magnitude larger than the number when the claim was proposed , we believe that it is timely to check whether or not the @xmath4 and @xmath2 hyperon resonances are still able to help the model in improving the agreement with experimental data , while keeping the hadronic cut - off reasonably `` hard '' .",
    "it is the main purpose of the present paper to discuss the limitation of the claim .",
    "furthermore , it is also important to investigate the role of other hyperon resonances in kaon photoproduction . since at present",
    "the number of data becomes sufficiently large , while the corresponding error bars are considerably small , we believe that there are just few degrees of freedom left in the model .",
    "this is obviously in contrast to the former situation .    in section [ sec : model ]",

    "[ fig : feynman ] .",
    "a long standing problem in the isobar model is the inclusion of nucleon , kaon , and hyperon resonances .",
    "the number of resonances available from the pdg listing @xcite was considered as too large . in the past , the number of experimental data was very limited .",
    "using a few well known resonances one could explain all available data .",
    "in fact , the main topic of discussions in the past is how to constrain the number of resonances in the phenomenological models .",
    "however , the situation seems to change with the coming of precise experimental data from recent measurements in modern laboratories .",
    "these data include not only differential cross sections , but also single and double polarization observables that are very sensitive to the choice of resonances in the model .",
    "thus , the new data could provide a stringent constraint to the existing phenomenological models .",
    "in fact , the new data can shed more light on the existence of the missing resonances .    in this study",
    "we include all nucleon resonances in the pdg listing @xcite that have masses between the @xmath10 threshold ( 1.609 gev ) and 2.2 gev .",
    "the resonance spin is limited only up to 3/2 in order to simplify the formalism .",
    "in addition , we also include the @xmath18 state , which was found in ref .",
    "@xcite to have important contribution in the photoproduction of @xmath10 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "our recent study @xcite corroborates this finding . in the @xmath17-channel ,",
    "we use two vector mesons with different parities , i.e. the @xmath21 and @xmath22 , that have been shown to provide a significant suppression to the divergence of the born terms . as a starting point , we include two hyperon resonances in the @xmath6-channel , which were claimed by ref .  @xcite to provide also significant suppression , so that the hadronic form factor cut - off can be constrained to a reasonable value . furthermore , to account for hadronic structure in the hadronic vertices we include hadronic form factors in a gauge invariant fashion @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", we choose the dipole - type , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the cut - off parameter , @xmath25 is the squared of four - momentum of the off - shell intermediate particle with the corresponding mass @xmath26 .",
    "note that this form has been used in most analyses of the meson - nucleon scattering as well as meson photoproduction .",
    "clearly , the use of other types of form factor is also possible in this case and the effect of different hadronic form factors on the isobar model could become an important issue in kaon photoproduction @xcite .",
    "as a first step , we try to reproduce the claim in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. certain hyperon resonances can help to suppress the diverging born terms . to this end",
    "we fit a model consisting of the born terms , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 resonances . for the sake of brevity we call this born and resonance configuration as the standard configuration . using this standard configuration",
    "we fit the model to the saphir @xcite and new data and call the result as model a and b , respectively . in the next step we add the missing @xmath7 nucleon resonance @xcite into the two models and repeat the fitting process .",
    "having finished this step we continue to include the @xmath4 , @xmath2 in the standard configuration and repeat the fitting process .",
    "finally , we include the @xmath7 , @xmath4 , and @xmath2 in the model and fit to the saphir and new data as before .",
    "the complete result obtained from this procedure is given in table  [ tab : janssen ] in terms of the obtained @xmath30 , where @xmath31 indicates the number of degrees of freedom , i.e. @xmath32 .",
    "we also quote the result of ref .",
    "@xcite in table  [ tab : janssen ] for comparison .",
    "note that in order to maintain consistency with the claim of ref .",
    "@xcite , in all configurations we limit the hadronic form factor cut - off to be @xmath33 gev during the fitting process .",

    "the difference in the @xmath30 might originate from the error - bars used in the fitting process . in our calculation , we have also included systematic error - bars in addition to statistical ones .",
    "this is reflected by the fact that the obtained @xmath30 in model a is mostly smaller than those in ref .",
    "nevertheless , model a reveals an interesting fact , i.e. the use of the @xmath7 resonance to suppress the diverging born terms is more effective than the use of two hyperon resonances , the @xmath4 and @xmath2 , as suggested by ref .",
    "indeed , this phenomenon also appears when we use the new experimental data ( with more than 3500 data points ) as shown by model b in the fourth column of table  [ tab : janssen ] .        by comparing the results of model a and b in the third and fourth columns of table  [ tab : janssen ] , respectively , it is apparent that the resonance configuration suggested by table  [ tab : janssen ] is unable to produce a reasonable agreement with experimental data .",
    "furthermore , we can also clearly see that including the missing @xmath7 nucleon resonance as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite results in a significant reduction of @xmath30 .",
    "nevertheless , combining this resonance with @xmath4 and @xmath2 in the standard configuration will reduce the @xmath30 to 4.07 , which is still beyond a reasonable value for a good agreement between model calculation and experimental data .",
    "the reason for that is obviously displayed in fig .  [",
    "fig : dif1 ] , where we compare the calculated differential cross sections obtained from model a and b with the prediction of kaon - maid @xcite .",
    "presumably , more nucleon resonances are required to explain the structures , which can not be reproduced by both model a and b. this topic will be discussed in the next subsection , when we include the higher nucleon resonances , which are found to be important in the coupled - channels study @xcite .",

    "@xcite , the use of hadronic form factor in kaon - maid @xcite has led to an underprediction of differential cross section data at forward angles .",
    "near forward angles , where experimental data are still available , the situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dif2 ] .",
    "the problem is apparent in the case of kaon - maid , which originates from the extracted form factor cut - off .",
    "we notice that the background terms of kaon - maid is strongly suppressed by a very soft form factor , i.e. the dipole form factor given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dipole ] ) with @xmath36 gev .",
    "however , in the case of model a and b we obtain the relatively larger cut - offs . i.e. @xmath37 gev and 1.60 gev , respectively , which correspond to relatively harder form factors .",
    "thus , both models do not exhibit a problem at forward angles as in the case of kaon - maid , although we also notice that model a can not reproduce experimental data at this kinematics , since it was fitted to old saphir data @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dif2 ] we can see that the hard hadronic form factors in both models are represented by the increase of the cross section as the kaon angle @xmath38 approaches forward directions .    we conclude this subsection by emphasizing that to suppress the diverging born terms the use of the @xmath4 and @xmath2 hyperon resonances as suggested by ref .",
    "@xcite is less effective than the use of the missing @xmath7 nucleon resonance as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , it is true that the soft hadronic cut - off leads to a strong suppression of the cross section at forward directions .      from the discussion in the previous subsection it is obvious that the number of resonances must be increased for the purpose of explaining other structures appearing in the new data and , therefore , minimizing the @xmath3 .",
    "using the modified standard configuration we obtained the best @xmath39 ( see model b , the fourth column of table [ tab : janssen ] ) , which indicates a rather poor agreement between model calculation and experimental data . to this end , we will use the nucleon resonance configuration in the isobar model developed in our recent study @xcite , which is able to nicely reproduce the presently available data .",

    "<S> we have investigated the role of hyperon resonances in the kaon photoproduction process , @xmath0 , by using a covariant isobar model . to this end , new experimental data are used in the fitting process , whereas the old saphir 1998 data are also used for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the result indicates that the @xmath1 and @xmath2 hyperon resonances can significantly reduce the @xmath3 and , simultaneously , can increase the hadronic form factor cut - off in the background terms . </S>",
    "<S> this finding is different from the result of the previous studies , which showed that the @xmath4 was important for this purpose , instead of the @xmath1 . </S>"
