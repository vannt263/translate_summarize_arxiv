    "the quantum dynamics and the quantum control of multipartite quantum systems have attracted much attention due to their applications to quantum information protocols ( to perform logic gates and for the transport and the teleportation of information ) and to nanosciences ( control of small nanostructures ) .",
    "a key problem is the understanding of the dynamical processes associated with the whole multipartite quantum system .",
    "these processes have a consequence on each component of the system , and could induce decoherence and relaxation .",
    "( @xcite ) . in order to explore this problem",
    "we consider the interesting example of a multipartite quantum system represented by a spin chain , i.e. a set of @xmath0 @xmath1-spins two by two coupled in order to form an open line chain . in this paper",
    "we consider both the heisenberg and the ising model to describe the spin - spin interactions which are responsible for the `` cohesion '' of the chain .",
    "the dynamical processes on the spin chain are induced by ultra - short kicks on all spins .",
    "the subject concerning decoherence processes of regularly kicked spin chains has been studied by some authors @xcite . in these previous studies ,",
    "the kick processes are regular . in the present paper",
    ", we want to consider irregular trains of kicks ( the strengths and the delays of the different kicks are modified with respect to the time ) which can potentially induce richer dynamical behaviors of the spin chain . indeed in a previous paper @xcite , we have observed several interesting behaviors . in this previous study",
    "we have considered only irregular kicked spin ensembles without any coupling between the spins .",
    "we can not then consider this ensemble as a multipartite system ( no information is exchanged between the spins ) but only as a set of independent systems dephased during the evolution .",
    "a goal of this paper is the study of such a phenomenon for a spin chain where the coupling induces inner decoherence and entanglement processes .",
    "the motivation to study of irregularly kicked spin chains is that in some situations the primary train of kicks addressed to the spins , must go through an environment ( considered as classical in this paper ) before to reach the target spins .",
    "it can be disturbed by this environment , see fig .",
    "[ kickedspinbath2 ] .",
    "the disturbance can attenuate the kick strengths and/or delay the arrival kicks .",
    "since each of the kick trains can be irregular , the spins can feel different trains .",
    "the set of kick trains is called a kick bath since we can assimilate the model to a spin chain in contact with a kind of classical bath .",
    "the disturbances are described by different classical dynamical systems . in this paper , we consider some academic classical dynamics in order to try to understand the behavior of a spin chain submitted to a real environment in next analyses .    a goal of this paper is to interpret the origins of the different evolutions of a kicked spin chain coupled by heisenberg or ising models ( decoherence , relaxation and entanglement ) , but also to see the transmission of the disorder in a kicked spin chain .",
    "we see in @xcite that the disorder induces into the classical kick bath by the disturbance is transmitted to the spin chain by the kicks . in this paper",
    "we will see that this effect is also present when the spins into the chain are coupled . besides , the interaction parameter is the source of the disorder transmission along the spin chain .",
    "it allows a larger disorder into the spin chain .",
    "if there is some disorder which appears into the spin chain , which is in opposition with the interaction process , the spins begin to get entangled with their neighbors .",
    "this phenomenon conducts to a lost of the initial information of each spins . in contrast with these analyses , it is important to ask the question of the possibility of keeping some coherence , some order into the spin chain in spite of the kick disorder .",
    "all this analysis can be very difficult because of the interactions between the spins , the entanglement and the state superpositions .",
    "we have chosen to consider an analysis of the phenomenon based on a semi - classical model of the spins @xcite .",
    "this analysis is based on the spin husimi distribution @xcite which is the quasiprobability distribution of a quantum state onto the classical phase space .",
    "even if our analysis is based on a semi - classical model for the interpretations , all the simulations are performed with a quantum model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the spin chain models disturbed by the kicks used in this study .",
    "the next section is devoted to the general behavior of the kicked spin chain .",
    "we study the entropy , the coherence and the population in order to understand how the disorder is transmitted and its consequences on the spin chain with respect to the coupling .",
    "we will see that the ising - x coupling is the interaction which conduces to the most lost of initial information with a large decoherence . whereas the heisenberg interaction can conserve some coherence .",
