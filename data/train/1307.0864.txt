    "as is well known @xcite , a solenoid of infinite length will generate a perfectly uniform axial magnetic field everywhere inside of a cylindrical volume .",
    "as is also well known @xcite , an infinitely - long `` @xmath0 coil '' ( i.e. , a cylindrical coil with a continuous surface current @xmath1 , with the angle @xmath2 defined relative to the @xmath3-axis as shown in fig .  [ fig : cos_theta_coil_schematic ] ) , will generate a perfectly uniform transverse magnetic field ( along the @xmath4-direction in fig .",
    "[ fig : cos_theta_coil_schematic ] ) within a cylindrical volume . and",
    "indeed , experiments requiring a highly uniform magnetic field have generally employed discretized and finite - length solenoidal or @xmath0 coils for the generation of highly uniform axial or transverse magnetic fields .",
    "for example , experimental searches for non - zero permanent electric dipole moments , such as of the neutron and the @xmath5hg and @xmath6ra atoms , require highly uniform magnetic fields and past and future experiments @xcite have typically used highly - optimized @xmath0 or solenoidal coils . in these experiments ,",
    "the volume required by the @xmath0 and solenoidal cylindrical coil forms is , in general , significantly larger than the sensitive experimental volume over which the requirements on the field uniformity and/or field gradient must be satisfied .",
    "coil with a continuous surface current distribution @xmath7 .",
    "note that a coil with such a surface current distribution is also commonly referred to as a `` sine - phi '' coil @xcite , where the angle @xmath8 is the usual cylindrical coordinate . ]",
    "perhaps less well known or appreciated is the fact that a _",
    "finite - sized _ spherical coil with a continuous surface current @xmath9 , shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : spherical_coil_schematic ] , where @xmath10 are the usual spherical coordinates , will generate a perfectly uniform magnetic field along the sphere s @xmath11-axis within the spherical volume @xcite .",
    "although the technical challenges associated with the fabrication of an experimentally - realizable discretized spherical coil ( e.g. , precise wire placement , etc . ) may be more significant than those associated with the fabrication of solenoidal and discretized @xmath0 coils , we note that the potential appeal of a spherical coil is that even for the ( non - realistic ) case of continuous surface currents , a spherical coil of finite size will generate a perfectly uniform field , whereas the @xmath0 and solenoidal coils must be of infinite length .",
    "that is , a spherical coil does not suffer from any such `` finite - length '' effects  that are by definition present in finite - sized @xmath0 and solenoidal coils .",
    "therefore , we conjecture that the ratio of the fiducial volume ( i.e. , the volume over which the requirements on the field uniformity or field gradient must be satisfied ) to the total volume occupied by a spherical coil form will be larger than this ratio for @xmath0 and solenoidal coil forms . and , indeed , a new experimental search for the neutron electric dipole moment will employ a spherical coil @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge , detailed calculations of the off - axis field uniformity properties of a discretized spherical coil have not been presented in the literature .    .",
    "]    in the remainder of this paper we investigate this conjecture .",
    "we begin , in section [ sec : models ] , by describing our models for our calculations of the magnetic fields for these three coil types , including our methods for the calculation of the off - axis fields for the solenoidal and spherical coils .",
    "we then present the numerical results of our calculations in section [ sec : results ] , where we ultimately compare the ratios of the fiducial volume to the total volume occupied by each of the coil types for various requirements on the field uniformity or field gradient .",
    "finally , we conclude with a summary of our findings in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we emphasize that throughout this paper we are considering standard ( i.e. , non - optimized ) versions of the @xmath0 and solenoidal coils ( i.e. , truncated versions of the infinitely - long ideal coils ) .",
    "in this section we describe our numerical models for the calculation of the magnetic fields ( on- and off - axis ) from discretized and finite - sized @xmath0 , solenoidal , and spherical coils .",
    "note that our discretization of the ideal surface currents is such that we use a single point ( i.e. , zero radius ) line wire to approximate regions of equal integrated surface current .",
    "we describe our implementation of such for each of the coil types below .       coil .",
    "the thick lines indicate the rectangular current loops .",
    "note that this choice of a return path for the currents is not unique ; another well - known approach is to employ a `` saddle - shaped '' winding @xcite , in which the return wires are wound around the perimeters of the cylinder ends . ]",
    "a schematic diagram of our discretized and finite - length @xmath0 coil is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : cos_theta_coil_discretized ] . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the discretization of an infinitely - long continuous @xmath12 surface current distribution into line currents approximating the continuous surface current distribution ( obtained by apportioning the total integrated current from @xmath13 to @xmath14 into equal discrete parts ) is such that the line currents are spaced at equal intervals along the indicated @xmath15-axis .",
    "thus , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cos_theta_coil_discretized ] , our model consists of a cylindrical shell of radius @xmath16 and length @xmath17 , upon which are wound @xmath18 rectangular current loops , spaced at equal intervals @xmath19 along the @xmath15-axis at positions @xmath20 , @xmath21 ,  , @xmath22 .",
    "the line currents then flow in the @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) direction for @xmath25 @xmath26 along the length of the cylinder .",
    "our model then assumes a simple return path for the currents ( i.e. , straight line currents along the @xmath27 direction ) , such that our closed current loops are rectangular .",
    "thus , all of the rectangular current loops are of the same length @xmath17 along the axis of the cylindrical form ( i.e. , the @xmath28-axis ) , but are of different lengths along the @xmath29-axis , where these lengths are constrained by the cylindrical form to be @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes the @xmath32th loop s position along the @xmath15-axis .",
    "the calculations we present later have assumed @xmath18 even ; one could , of course , consider @xmath18 odd , with an additional wire located at @xmath33 , but this would not modify the symmetry of the problem .",
    "also , note that although our model does not include any connecting wires between adjacent current loops ( which are , of course , required if a @xmath0 is to be wound with a single wire ) , an actual @xmath0 coil can be wound in such a way so that the contributions to the field from the connecting wires carrying the current from , say , loop @xmath32 to loop @xmath34 to loop @xmath35 , etc .",
    "are largely cancelled by the return wire to the current source .",
    "it is then straightforward to calculate the magnetic field everywhere in space in rectangular coordinates via the biot - savart law .",
    "because the surface current distribution on an ideal solenoid is uniform in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath8 and @xmath28 ( with @xmath28 oriented the solenoid axis ) , such that @xmath36 , our model for a discretized and finite - length solenoidal coil consists of a cylindrical coil form of radius @xmath16 and length @xmath17 upon which are wound @xmath18 circular current loops of radius @xmath16 oriented in the indicated @xmath37-plane and spaced at equal intervals @xmath38 along the length of the cylinder . note that each of our discretized current loops is `` isolated '' ( i.e. , stand - alone circular loops , with no connecting wires ) , such that we do not attempt to account for the effects of a helical winding inherent to the winding of a solenoid with one continuous wire .",

    "we sum the power series until the contribution of the @xmath55th term is @xmath56 .",
    "the resulting @xmath57 and @xmath58 field components for each circular current loop are then converted to rectangular field components .",
    "the total field @xmath59 at observation point @xmath49 from all @xmath18 circular current loops comprising the discretized solenoidal coil is then simply the superposition of the rectangular field components from each of the current loops .          finally , a schematic diagram of our discretized spherical coil is shown in fig .",

    ", our model consists of a spherical form of radius @xmath60 upon which are wound @xmath18 circular current loops oriented in the @xmath37-plane .",
    "the discretization of the spherical coil s @xmath61 continuous surface current distribution into @xmath18 discrete line wires proceeds in an identical manner to how the discretization of a @xmath0 coil current is performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and is as follows .",
    "suppose we desire to divide the integral of the surface current , @xmath62 , into @xmath18 equal parts , with each part bounded by the angles @xmath63 $ ] for @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
