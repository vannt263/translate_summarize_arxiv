    "in recent years , there have been a number of experimental and theoretical studies  @xcite aimed at understanding the decay of light compound nuclei ( cn ) and dinuclear systems ( a@xmath5 @xmath7 60 ) formed through low energy heavy - ion reactions ( e@xmath2 @xmath7 10 mev / nucleon ) . in most of the reactions studied , the properties of the observed , fully energy damped yields have been successfully explained in terms of either a fusion - fission ( ff ) mechanism or a heavy - ion resonance behavior  @xcite .",
    "the strong resonance - like structures observed in elastic and inelastic excitation functions of @xmath8 mg + @xmath8 mg  @xcite and @xmath1si + @xmath1si scatterings  @xcite have been suggestive of the presence of shell stabilized , highly deformed configurations in the @xmath9cr and @xmath10ni n = z dinuclear systems , respectively  @xcite . the investigation of the structure of the doubly - magic @xmath10ni nucleus is particularly interesting , with the recent observation  @xcite in this system of deformed bands that may be the precursors of large deformation or superdeformation behavior in the a@xmath5 @xmath6 60 mass region  @xcite .    in a recent experiment using the eurogam phase ii @xmath11-ray spectrometer , we have investigated  @xcite the possibility of preferential population of highly deformed bands in the symmetric fission channel of the @xmath10ni@xmath12 cn , produced through the @xmath1si + @xmath1si reaction at e@xmath2 = 112 mev , which corresponds to the energy of the conjectured j@xmath13 = 38@xmath14 quasimolecular resonance  @xcite . some evidence for this behavior",

    "the present work involves the search for the possible occurence of highly deformed configurations of the @xmath10ni@xmath12 cn produced in the @xmath1si + @xmath1si reaction .",
    "light charged particles ( lcp ) emitted at the resonance energy  @xcite of e@xmath2 = 112 mev , and in - plane coincidences of the lcp s with both evaporation residues ( er ) and ff fragments have been measured .",
    "the lcp s emitted during the cn decay processes carry information on the underlying nuclear shapes and level densities .",
    "in particular , new information on nuclear structure far above the yrast line can be obtained from their study by a comparison with statistical model calculations  @xcite .",
    "the lcp s emitted from ff fragments may provide the deformation properties of these fragments .",
    "studies of nuclear shapes based on evaporated lcp spectra have evoked considerable interest and controversy  @xcite . for example , an extremely large deformation suggested in the decay of the @xmath15ni@xmath16 cn  @xcite , formed in the reaction @xmath4si + @xmath4si at e@xmath2 = 120 mev , was not supported by the statistical model analysis of nicolis and sarantites  @xcite .    in this paper we will focus on the lpc s found in coincidence with er s .",

    "the experiment was performed at the ires strasbourg vivitron tandem facility , using a 112 mev @xmath1si beam incident on a self - supported 180 @xmath17g/@xmath18 thick @xmath1si target prepared at ires .",
    "additional targets of natural @xmath19c , gold , and formvar were irradiated for calibration , background determination , and normalization purposes .",
    "the elemental compositions of the @xmath1si target was accurately determined at ires using rutherford back scattering ( rbs ) techniques with @xmath20h and @xmath21he beams provided by the 4 mv van de graaff accelerator  @xcite .",
    "the main target contaminants were c and o , each contributing less than 2@xmath22 to the total number of atoms in the target , and cu .",
    "because of the relatively low beam energy with respect to the barrier energy for cu , this contaminant is not expected to affect our results .",
    "the natural c target was used to obtain the background correction for this element .",
    "these corrections were found to be relatively small .",
    "both the heavy ions and their associated lcp s were detected using the icare charged particle multidetector array  @xcite .",
    "the heavy fragments ( er , quasi - elastic , deep - inelastic and ff fragments ) have been detected in 6 gas - silicon hybrid telescopes ( ic ) , each consisting of an ionization chamber , with a thin mylar entrance window , followed by a 500 @xmath17 m thick si(sb ) detector .",
    "the ic s were located at @xmath23 = -15@xmath24 , -20@xmath24 , -25@xmath24 , -30@xmath24 , -35@xmath24 , and -40@xmath24 in two distinct reaction planes ( for each plane , the positive and negative angles refer to the opposite and same side of the beam as the heavy - ion ic detector , respectively ) .",
    "the in - plane detection of coincident lcp s was done using four triple telescopes ( 40 @xmath17 m si , 300 @xmath17 m si , and 2 cm csi(tl ) ) placed at forward angles ( @xmath23 = + 15@xmath24 , + 25 @xmath24 , + 35@xmath24 , and + 45@xmath24 ) , 16 two elemental telescopes ( 40 @xmath17 m si , 2 cm csi(tl ) ) placed at forward and backward angles ( + 40@xmath24 @xmath7 @xmath23 @xmath7 + 115@xmath24 ) , and finally two other ic s telescopes placed at the most backward angles @xmath23 = + 130@xmath24 and + 150@xmath24 . the ic s were filled with isobutane and their pressures were kept at 30 torr at backward angles and 60 torr at forward angles , respectively , for detecting heavy fragments and light fragments .",
    "the acceptance of each telescope was defined by thick aluminium collimators .",
    "the calibration of the icare multidetector array was done using radioactive @xmath25th @xmath0-sources , a precision pulser , and elastic scattering of 112 mev @xmath1si from @xmath26au , @xmath1si , and @xmath19c targets in a standard manner .",
    "in addition , @xmath0-particles emitted in the @xmath19c(@xmath27o,@xmath21he)@xmath8mg@xmath12 reaction at e@xmath2(@xmath27o ) = 53 mev provide known @xmath0-particle energies from the decay of @xmath8 mg excited states thus allowing for the calibration of the backward angles detectors  @xcite .",

    "the dashed circular arcs , centered on the center of mass v@xmath33 and defined to visualize the maxima of particle velocity spectra , describe the bulk of data rather well as can be observed for instance for the proton energy spectra .",
    "they have radii very close to the coulomb velocities of @xmath0-particles and protons in the decay of @xmath10ni@xmath12 @xmath34 @xmath35fe + @xmath21he , and of @xmath10ni@xmath12 @xmath34 @xmath36co + @xmath20h , respectively .",
    "the agreement is apparently deteriorated for the @xmath0-particle spectra by the relatively large low - energy thresholds of the most backward - angle telescopes . despite these deviations ,",
    "the spectra can be understood by assuming a sequential evaporative process and successive emission sources starting with the thermally equilibrated @xmath10ni@xmath12 cn until the final source characterised by a complete freeze - out of the residual nucleus .",
    "the invariant cross section contours fall around the dashed circular arcs centered at the cn recoil velocity v@xmath37 = v@xmath33 , and represent the isotropic emission patterns to be expected for a fusion - evaporation mechanism after full - momentum transfer and complete fusion ( cf ) .",
    "lcp s emitted from direct reactions or from a pre - thermalization emission process would have manifested themselves as even stronger deviations from the dashed circular arcs , as shown at much higher bombarding energies , e(@xmath1si ) = 12.4 , 19.7 , and 30 mev / nucleon , for the @xmath1si + @xmath1si reaction  @xcite . in these early works",
    "@xcite only a few pre - equilibrium lcp s have been shown to be emitted prior to fusion at the lowest energy e(@xmath1si ) = 12.4 mev / nucleon  @xcite , therefore the absence of a pre - equilibrium component at the present energy e(@xmath1si ) of 4 mev / nucleon is expected .",

    "there is no bias due to direct or preequilibrium processes .",
    "thus we are confident that essentially all the emitted particle are associated with a statistical de - excitation process arising from a thermalized source such as the @xmath10ni cn .",
    "the energy spectra of these particles , presented thereafter , are also strongly supportive of this conclusion .",
    "typical exclusive energy spectra of the corresponding @xmath0-particles are shown in fig .  3 at the indicated angles ( from @xmath39 = + 40@xmath3 to @xmath39 = + 65@xmath3 ) for the @xmath1si + @xmath1si reaction at e@xmath2(@xmath1si ) = 112 mev .",
    "the measured @xmath0-particles are in coincidence with all er s ( 20 @xmath7 z @xmath7 25 ) identified in the ic detector located at @xmath38 = -15@xmath3 ( the ic s located at more backward angles have too low statistics for fusion - evaporation events to be used in the analysis ) .",
    "the spectral shapes of the coincident @xmath0-particles are very similar to inclusive energy spectra but without low - energy , non - maxwellian contributions , as shown in fig .",
    "all the spectra have maxwellian shapes with an exponential fall - off at high energy which reflects a relatively low temperature ( t@xmath40 @xmath6 [ 8e@xmath41/a@xmath5]@xmath43 = 3.1 mev ) of the decaying nucleus .",
    "the shape and high - energy slopes are also found to be essentially independent of angle in the c.m .",
    "these behaviors suggest , as for the velocity spectra , a statistical cn decay process .    the in - plane angular correlations of @xmath0-particles and protons ( measured in the -115@xmath3 @xmath7 @xmath39 @xmath7 + 115@xmath3 angular range ) in coincidence with all the er s ( 20 @xmath7 z @xmath7 25 ) , produced in the @xmath1si(112 mev ) + @xmath1si reaction ,",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "the angular correlations are peaked strongly on the opposite side of the er detector located at @xmath38 = -15@xmath3 with respect to the beam .",
    "this peaking is the result of the momentum conservation .",
    "the solid lines shown in the figure are the results of statistical model predictions for cf and equilibrium decay using the code cacarizo  @xcite , as discussed in the next section .",
    "the analysis of the data has been performed using cacarizo  @xcite , the monte carlo version of the statistical model code cascade  @xcite .",
    "the parameters needed for the statistical description , i.e. the nuclear level densities and the barrier transmission probabilities , are usually obtained from the study of evaporated light particle spectra . in recent years , it has been observed that statistical model calculations , using standard parameters , are unable to predict satisfactorily the shape of the evaporated @xmath0-particle energy spectra  @xcite with the measured average energies of the @xmath0-particles found to be much lower than the corresponding theoretical predictions . in the present calculations as well as in previous studies  @xcite ,",
    "the transmission coefficients of all competing evaporation channels , including n , p , and @xmath0 particle emission , are generated from published optical model parameters for spherical nuclei .",
    "several attempts have been made in the past few years to explain lcp energy anomaly either by changing the emission barrier or by using a spin - dependent level density .",
    "the change in the emission barriers and , correspondingly , the transmission probabilities affects the lower energy part of the calculated evaporation spectra . on the other hand",
    "the high - energy part of the spectra depends critically on the available phase space obtained from the level densities at high spin . in hot rotating nuclei formed in heavy - ion reactions ,",
    "the level density at higher angular momentum is spin dependent .",
    "the level density , @xmath44 , for a given angular momentum @xmath45 and energy @xmath46 is given by the well known fermi gas expression :    @xmath47^{1/2 } ) \\label{lev}\\ ] ]    where @xmath48 the level density parameter is constant and set equal to @xmath48 = a/8 mev@xmath30 ( a is the mass number ) , t is the  nuclear \" temperature , and @xmath49 is the pairing correction , e@xmath50 = @xmath51j(j+1 ) is the rotational energy , @xmath52 is the effective moment of inertia , @xmath53 = @xmath54ar@xmath55 = @xmath54a@xmath56r@xmath57 is the rigid body moment of inertia ( r@xmath58 is the radius parameter ) , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the deformability parameters defined in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the angular momentum distribution used in the statistical model calculations depends on diffusivity parameter @xmath49l and the critical angular momentum for fusion l@xmath61 .",
    "a fixed value of @xmath49l = 1@xmath62 is assumed for the calculations .",
    "the l@xmath61 values were deduced based on observed complete fusion cross section .",
    "these values are shown in table i for a number of systems with 46 @xmath7 @xmath63 @xmath7 60 . the same angular momenta value of l@xmath61 = 34@xmath62 is found for both the @xmath1si + @xmath1si  @xcite and @xmath4si + @xmath4si  @xcite fusion reactions . otherwise we have used the cascade parameters for the nickel isotopes ( see table 8 of ref .",
    "the only parameters adjusted in the calculations were those directly associated with the system deformation , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the so - called deformability parameters .",
    "in the present analysis we have chosen to follow the procedure proposed by huizenga and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "no attempt was made to modify the transmission coefficients since it has been shown that the effective barrier heights are fairly insensitive to the nuclear deformation  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , by changing the deformability parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 one can simulate the spin - dependent level density  @xcite .",
    "the cacarizo calculations have been performed using two sets of input parameters : one with a standard set of the rotating liquid drop model  @xcite ( rldm ) ( parameter * set a * ) , consistent with the deformation of the finite - range rotating liquid drop model  @xcite ( frldm ) , and another with a spin - dependent moment of inertia and larger values for the deformability parameters ( parameter * set b * ) .",
    "the rldm parameter * set a * with small values given to deformability parameters ( @xmath59 = 7.6 x 10@xmath64 and @xmath60 = 6.7 x 10@xmath65 ) produces a yrast line very close to the frldm predictions , as shown for example for the neighbouring @xmath66cu nucleus in ref .",

    ".  @xcite ) .",
    "the final values of the deformability parameters , @xmath59 = 1.2 x 10@xmath67 and @xmath60 = 1.1 x 10@xmath68 given in table i for the parameter * set b * , yield a significant lowering of the corresponding frldm yrast line .",
    "they have been chosen in order to reproduce the exclusive data rather than the inclusive data ( although they have almost identical spectral shapes especially in the high - energy region ) , the latter being possibly influenced for low - energy lcp s by small non - statistical components resulting from inelastic collisions or breakup processes that are not accounted for in the statistical model calculations .    the dashed lines in fig .",
    "3 show the predictions of cacarizo for @xmath1si + @xmath1si using the parameter * set a * consistent with frldm deformation  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the average energies of the measured @xmath0-particle spectra are lower than those predicted by these statistical model calculations .",
    "the same observation can be made in fig .  5 for the inclusive @xmath4si + @xmath4si data",
    "@xcite which have been analysed with the same parameters as used for the @xmath1si + @xmath1si reaction ( the corresponding inclusive @xmath1si + @xmath1si data are also displayed in fig .  6 for the sake of comparison ) .",
    "the solid lines of figs .  3 , 5 and 6 show the predictions of cacarizo using the increased values of the deformability parameters ( see parameter * set b * given in table i ) .",
    "the agreement is considerably improved .",
    "for instance in figs .",
    "3 the shapes of the exclusive @xmath0-particle energy spectra are very well reproduced for @xmath1si + @xmath1si with parameter * set b * ( solid lines ) including the deformation effects . furthermore and despite the fact that , for the inclusive @xmath0-particle spectra of the @xmath1si + @xmath1si reactions of fig .",
    "6 , there appears to be an excess of yield in the subbarrier energy data , the chosen parametrization of the moment of inertia does also a fairly good job .",
    "it may be mentionned that in the case of protons , as they carry away less angular momentum than @xmath0-particles , their calculated energy spectra do not shift as the spin - dependent parametrization of the moment of inertia is introduced .",
    "the statistical model results using the two parameter sets reproduce equally well the experimental velocity spectra and angular correlations .",
    "the statistical model calculations displayed for protons on figs . 1 , 2 , and 4 have been performed with parameter * set b * ( solid lines of fig.4 ) including the deformation effects ( calculations with parameter * set a * are not displayed ) .",
    "the deformability parameters for the other systems , given in table i , were extracted using the same approach of fitting procedures  @xcite that was employed in the present work for the @xmath1si + @xmath1si and @xmath4si + @xmath4si reactions .",
    "the cacarizo predictions shown in figs .",
    "1 and 2 , also performed with the parameter * set b * given in table i , reproduce the maxima of the inclusive and exclusive invariant cross sections quite well .",
    "this confirms that most of the yields have a statistical origin .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental alpha - to - proton ratio r@xmath69 = 0.40 @xmath70 0.06 which value is better predicted by calculations using parameter * set b * ( r@xmath71 = 0.39 ) than calculations using parameter * set a * ( r@xmath72 = 0.48 ) .",
    "parameter * set a * overestimate the alpha - to - proton ratio mainly because of first chance @xmath0-particle .",
    "parameter * set b * allows the emission of more nucleons in the cascade and the average emission step for @xmath0-particles occurs later in the cascade .",
    "thus the velocity plots , the spectral shapes , the angular correlations and relative cross sections of @xmath0-particle and proton emission are all reproduced correctly . on the other hand",
    ", the discrepancies observed at the most negative angles ( between @xmath39 = -30@xmath24 and -110@xmath24 ) of the in - plane angular correlations of fig .",
    "4 , for protons and even more for @xmath0-particles , are sometimes difficult to be understood as already stressed in refs .",
    "the same disagreement is present with the calculations using parameter * set a*. however , it is seen that the shapes of the experimental angular correlations are well reproduced by the statistical theory for the positive angles , although a very small shift of @xmath49@xmath39 = 10 - 15@xmath3 may improve the comparison .",
    "in addition , it is interesting to note that for the @xmath4si + @xmath4si reaction the relative multiplicities of nucleons and @xmath0-particles deduced from the experimental data  @xcite ( m@xmath73 = 0.469@xmath700.035 , m@xmath74 = 0.343@xmath700.035 , and m@xmath75 = 0.188@xmath700.035 ) are in better agreement with the calculations using the parameter * set b * ( m@xmath76 = 0.484 , m@xmath77 = 0.312 , and m@xmath78 = 0.204 ) than those using the parameter * set a * ( m@xmath79 = 0.459 , m@xmath80 = 0.293 , and m@xmath81 = 0.248 ) .    as a whole ,",
    "the present statistical model calculations describe rather well all the measured observables for both the @xmath1si + @xmath1si and @xmath4si + @xmath4si reactions , in contrast to other recent studies which have needed extra dynamical effects in the evaporative processes  @xcite .    in order to better appreciate the magnitude of the possible deformation effects which are suggested by our choice statistical model approach",
