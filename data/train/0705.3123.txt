    "the behavior of turbulent systems is fairly well understood from numerical simulations of the navier - stokes equations but a deep analytical understanding of fully developed turbulence based on these equations is still lacking ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a fully developed turbulent state is obtained when the reynolds number of the flow grows towards infinity which for instance can be realized in the limit of vanishing viscosity .",
    "this limit of the navier - stokes equations is known to be singular and when the viscosity is identically zero the system is usually termed the euler equations ( without external forcing ) which are believed to exhibit a singularity in a finite time .",
    "direct numerical simulations of the navier - stokes equations at high reynolds numbers are generally very cumbersome and in the last decades shell models of turbulence have become strong alternatives to direct simulations @xcite . indeed , using shell model approaches",
    "one easily simulates reynolds numbers of the order from @xmath0 up to @xmath1 .",
    "shells models provide excellent agreement with statistical experimental data , such as structure functions , probability distribution functions , etc @xcite .",
    "in contrast shell models generally fail to provide knowledge about geometrical structures as these models are too purely resolved in fourier space .    in this paper",
    "we take our starting point in shell models with relatively few shells in the euler case of vanishing viscosity and no external forcing",
    ". this might not be a very realistic case for a real fluid flow but we are nevertheless able to solve the shell model exactly in this limit . in the case of three shells",
    "we find the full dynamical solutions in terms of jacobi elliptic functions .",
    "we furthermore show that the solutions are stable as is confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "in addition , we find that no other solutions are possible meaning that the goy shell model with three shells is here shown to be fully integrable . if we consider this system as a low - dimensional version of the euler equations ( possessing the same basic structure and symmetries as the real euler equations ) , our results lead to the interesting conclusion that despite the driving there are no finite time singularities for such a system .    it is well known that the goy shell model possesses a period three symmetry @xcite . we therefore attack the model with six and nine shells and find again analytical solutions is term of jacobi elliptic functions .",
    "we obtain the interesting results that some of these periodic solutions are unstable whereas others are stable .",
    "this observation is very much related to previous studies on periodic solutions in the goy model @xcite , in other turbulent systems @xcite and in the kuramoto - shivashinsky equation @xcite .",
    "kawahara and kida identified periodic orbits in plane couette flow @xcite and van veen and kida have looked for periodic orbits in a symmetry reduced models of fully developed turbulence @xcite .",
    "toh and itano @xcite and walaffe @xcite have identified periodic structures in channel flows and eckhardt et al has studied pipe flows @xcite . the kuramoto - shivashinsky system is a field equation that does not model a turbulent fluid but nevertheless possesses chaotic states developed from non - linear mode interactions . ref .",
    "@xcite identified a multitude of unstable periodic solution in the ks equation .",
    "however , frisch and co - workers found that the phase space of the ks equations contains small isolated areas which include stable periodic solutions @xcite .",
    "it is nevertheless believed that a chaotic attractor of a large dimension in a high - dimentional space can be though of as composed of an ordered infinity of unstable periodic orbits (  hopf s last hope \" , see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed long unstable periodic orbits have been obtained for the goy model subjected to forcing and viscosity @xcite thus supporting this picture of a strange attractor .",
    "our results therefore bridge these observations by finding exact analytical periodic solutions to the unforced goy model which appear both to be stable and unstable .",
    "it is important to note that our analytical solutions possess a phase freedom so our results define a continuous infinity of exact solutions for the goy model . since we shall show ( see appendix a ) that for infinitely many shells a kolmogorov solution is obtained , this means that the periodic solutions are physically important and constitute a non - trivial part of the phase space .",
    "we also note that one can obtains similar jacobi type solutions for the sabra shell model @xcite although the specific recursion relations for the amplitudes of the jacobi elliptic functions possess different conjugations ( see appendix b ) . for the sabra model self - similar quasi - soliton solutions",
    "have been identified in ref .",
    "@xcite .    when a small forcing term is added we find that some but not all of the stable solutions become unstable .",
    "numerically we observe that the dynamics either becomes chaotic on a strange attractor in the 12-dimensional space or quasiperiodic with a regular time evolution .",
    "the transition can be driven by varying the initial condition in the sixth shell and we show numerically examples of such transitions .",
    "in this section we shall find solutions to the goy - model with three shells for the cases with no forcing where the phases are constant , and where the phases are variable .",
    "this model is integrable .",
    "further , we also consider the model with ( an imaginary ) force , and find a solution .",
    "the main point in this investigation is that it will serve as a warm up exercise for the solution with an arbitrary number of shells given in the next section with further details in appendix a.      the goy model is a rough approximation to the navier - stokes equations and is formulated on a discrete set of @xmath2-values , @xmath3 . in term of a complex fourier mode , @xmath4 , of the velocity field the model reads @xmath5 with suitable boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 is an external , constant forcing ( here on the first mode ) and @xmath7 is the kinematic viscosity . from these equations we have energy @xmath8 as well as helicity @xmath9 ( for 3d where @xmath10 ) and enstrophy @xmath11 ( for 2d where @xmath12 ) conservations @xcite .",
    "the mathematics of the three shell case has been studied before @xcite in a reduced version of 2d mhd with interactions between only three wave vectors .",
    "the structure of these equations is the same as the three - shell goy model discussed below .",
    "however , the physics of the model in ref .",
    "@xcite is in 2d and is not the same as the goy model , where we can study different dimensions via different conservation laws .",
    "initially , we shall for simplicity solve the three - shell model without any force or viscosity ( i.e. @xmath13 ) and with constant phases of the velocity functions @xmath4 .",
    "it is then easy to see that the sum of these constant phases must be @xmath14 .",
    "therefore we replace @xmath15 by @xmath16 , and take the new @xmath15 as well as @xmath17 and @xmath18 to be real .",
    "the three - shell equations then become @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 from these equations we have energy conservation as well as helicity ( 3d ) or enstrophy ( 2d ) conservations . however , the three - shell model has two other conservation laws . combining ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) we easily find , @xmath22 here @xmath23 is a constant which is determined by the initial conditions . in a similar manner",
    "we obtain from eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 is again a constant determined by the initial conditions .",
    "thus , @xmath26 we note that @xmath27 is the total energy .",
    "the conservation laws ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) imply that the three shell model with constant phases and no forcing is completely integrable ( see eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) below ) .",
    "hence there is no chaotic behavior .",
    "later we shall show that even if a constant imaginary forcing is included , the model is fully integrable .",
    "from ( [ 2 ] ) we have @xmath28 by means of eqs .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) we can express @xmath15 and @xmath18 in terms of @xmath17 and eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) then gives @xmath29 this solution is thus in general an elliptic integral . if we substitute . ]",
    "@xmath30 , where cn is the jacobi elliptic function , we obtain @xmath31 where the modulus of the jacobi elliptic function is given by @xmath32 also , cn@xmath33 is the inverse jacobi function .",
    "the jacobi functions depend on the elliptic integrals ( @xmath34 ) @xmath35 by use of the conservation laws eqs .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) we can easily find the other @xmath36s , @xmath37 where we reintroduced the phase in @xmath15 , and @xmath38 here we used that the jacobi elliptic functions satisfy @xmath39 and their derivatives satisfy @xmath40 these relations clearly shows the intimate connection between the jacobi elliptic functions and the three - shell model . in the next sections we shall see that this remark can be generalized to an arbitrary number of shells .    as to the integrability of three - shell model , one can argue geometrically as follows : since the total energy is conserved , the time evolution is confined to the surface of a sphere in @xmath41 .",
    "now take any one of the other two conserved quantities eqs.([4],[5 ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to a cylinder along the @xmath18-axis with elliptical cross section .",
    "the intersection between this cylinder and the sphere gives then the line along which the time evolution can proceed .",
    "the second conserved quantity could limit everything to points , but it does not do so , because it is not linearly independent of the other two .",
    "so this is then the geometrical origin of the solutions in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "we mention that the elliptic functions can be defined by ( see @xcite ) @xmath42 they have product representations and fourier expansions @xmath43 @xmath44 and @xmath45 here @xmath46 and @xmath47 . the constants @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be obtained from the hypergeometric function @xmath50 the hypergeometric function @xmath51 is analytic in the plane cut from from @xmath52 to @xmath53 . since @xmath54 depends on @xmath55 through eq .",
    "( [ k^2 ] ) all results can be analytically continued in the cut plane from 2d to 3d .",
    "it should be noted that for small @xmath2 the fourier expansions in practice only contain very few terms , since @xmath56 is small .",
    "this also applied when @xmath2 is not so small .",
    "for example , if @xmath57 , then @xmath58 and hence @xmath59 , so @xmath60 is fast decreasing .",
    "however , when @xmath2 approaches 1 , a large number of terms are needed in the fourier transforms because in this case @xmath56 is not small .",
    "this follows because @xmath56 can be expressed in terms of @xmath2 by the formula @xmath61    in the case @xmath62 , i.e. @xmath63 , the solution ( [ master ] ) does not give an oscillating solution any longer .",
    "instead one obtains @xmath64 in this case @xmath65 , and obviously an infinite number of fourier modes are needed to produce the exponentially decreasing behavior ( [ exp ] ) . from eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) one can easily obtain @xmath15 by use of the conservation law and ( [ 5 ] ) , @xmath66 thus , at @xmath67 all the energy has gone to the @xmath68mode .    in three dimensions @xmath69 is positive , whereas in two dimension this quantity is negative . from ( [ k^2 ] ) it then follows that @xmath70 in 3d , whereas @xmath71 in 2d if @xmath72 .",
    "the jacobi elliptic functions can be continued to negative @xmath54 , so this does not pose any problem .",
    "the continued functions are given by @xmath73 for @xmath74 these functions are continuous .    the solutions ( [ n1])-([n3 ] ) simplify if @xmath75 and @xmath76 . from ( [ k^2 ] )",
    "we see that in this case @xmath77 , and @xmath78 here @xmath79 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we show these exact solutions by direct numerical integration of the goy model with three shells ( with specific initial conditions ) . note the familiar behavior of the jacobi elliptic functions .",
    "two different values of the parameter @xmath55 are shown in order to vary the elliptic functions parameter @xmath80 .",
    "the solutions are stable and the numerical integrations can proceed indefinitely .",
    "we also mention that if @xmath81 , corresponding to @xmath82 , sn and cn become sin and cos , respectively , and dn approaches the constant one . from eq .",

    "( [ modulus ] ) in the square bracket to get @xmath89 from which we get @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a constant .",
    "we see that if the phases are constants , i.e. @xmath92 , their sum must be @xmath93 mod @xmath94 ( i.e. @xmath95 , ... ) , as already used in the previous subsection .    from the cosine in ( [ 300 ] ) we can compute the sine and insert it in eqs .",
    "( [ modulus ] ) . by this procedure",
    "we arrive at @xmath96 in this equation we have inserted a positive square root , corresponding to a positive sine . since the left hand sides of the eqs .",
    "( [ 600 ] ) can also be negative in some range of @xmath97 values , it follows that for such values of @xmath97 a negative sign should be chosen for in front of the square roots in eqs .",
    "( [ 600 ] ) , corresponding to negative values of the sine . in order not to make the notation too clumsy we do not indicate this explicitly .",
    "further from eq .",

    "( [ 600 ] ) we obtain for example for @xmath101 the equation of motion , @xmath102 this is again an elliptic type of integral .",
    "however , it is slightly more complicated than the solutions considered in the previous subsection .    inside the square root",
    "we have a polynomial of third degree in @xmath103 .",
    "if we introduce the zeros of this polynomial , this is the prototype of an integral which can be inverted by the use of theta functions @xcite .",
    "however , instead of seeking the most general solution , in the following we shall study only a limited range of parameters corresponding to a limited range of the initial values of the @xmath36s .    to obtain a relatively simple solution we must remember that the jacobi elliptic functions are not really independent , as is seen from eq . ( [ dependence ] ) .",
    "therefore one could attempt to make an ansatz in such a manner that inside the square root we have three squares of elliptic functions , which requires @xmath104 with a suitable choice of the @xmath105 and @xmath106 constants the square root in eq .",
    "( [ 800 ] ) could then produce the product @xmath107 to be matched by the derivative in the numerator , @xmath108 ( see eq .",
    "( [ derivative ] ) ) .    instead of proceeding from the integral ( [ 800 ] )",
    "it is actually easier to insert the ansatz ( [ ansatz1 ] ) directly in the equations of motion ( [ 600 ] ) .",
    "this gives a number of algebraic equations .",
    "when we differentiate the functions ( [ ansatz1 ] ) in order to insert them on the left hand sides in ( [ 600 ] ) we get a result proportional to @xmath109 with @xmath110 by use of eqs .",

    "one can study this question in general by first solving for @xmath120 in terms of @xmath121 by use of eq .",
    "( [ condition1 ] ) , and ( [ condition3 ] ) then becomes a second order equation which gives @xmath122 in terms of @xmath123 . in this way we obtain @xmath124 @xmath125 as well as @xmath126 the last restriction",

    "( [ nn ] ) we see that the ansatz ( [ ansatz1 ] ) is valid only when cosine of the sum of the initial phases is equal to plus / minus one , i.e. @xmath127 this does not mean that the phases at later times are restricted in this way .",
    "the requirements ( [ emil]),([emil2 ] ) and ( [ nn ] ) do not give acceptable ( real ) results for all values of @xmath123 and @xmath128 , since we need to ensure that in ( [ nn ] ) @xmath129 and that the square root in ( [ emil2 ] ) should be real .",
    "let us therefore give a numerical example where the results are good .",
    "we have found that if @xmath130 ( 3d , with the often used value @xmath131 ) and @xmath132 the following values are completely consistent ( the square root is real ! ) , @xmath133 for initial values of the phases and the @xmath100s which are not covered by the ansatz ( [ ansatz1 ] ) one must go back to the standard elliptic integral ( [ 800 ] ) , and treat it in other ways than done here .",
    "the solution ( [ ansatz1 ] ) can be used to obtain an integral representation for the phases .",
    "we can insert the cosine from eq .",
    "( [ 300 ] ) in the equations of motion for the phases ( [ phase ] ) , and we get @xmath134 with similar expressions for the other phases .    it should also be mentioned that it is possible to take into account the viscosity terms in the equations for the phases .",
    "the result is @xmath135 with similar expressions for the other phases .",
    "unfortunately we have not been able to solve for the modulus @xmath136 when viscosity is included .",
    "in conclusion we have seen that if the phases are allowed to vary , this situation gives rize to the new solutions ( [ ansatz1 ] ) .",
    "so , although the phases do not appear in the energy and other conserved quantities and one might therefore consider them unphysical , this is not true because of their dynamical importance . as the phases are allowed to vary",
    "continuously this indeed outlines an infinity of exact periodic solutions to the goy models with three shells .",
    "we shall now consider the case where a constant force ( @xmath6 is taken to be imaginary , @xmath137 ) is included in the first shell , so that ( [ 1 ] ) reads @xmath138 whereas the other two equations ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) are unchanged .",
    "for this reason we derive like in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) @xmath139 however , eq . ( [ 5 ] )",

    "we observe the interesting phenomenon that the dn - function undergoes a period doubling when the value of the forcing is changed .",
    "we were however not able to identify a series of period doubling eventually leading into a chaotic state .",

    "the shell model without viscosity and forcing @xmath162 is satisfied exactly by the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) , because by direct insertion we get @xmath163 and using that the @xmath156s are defined mod 3 in the index we get @xmath164 which shows that the @xmath156s cancel out on both sides of eq .",
    "the @xmath165s should therefore satisfy @xmath166 this can be rewritten as a recursion relation @xmath167    we have not succeeded in showing that this relation always has a solution .",

    "the goy model has been modified by changing the order of the complex conjugates of the velocity amplitudes resulting in the sabra model @xcite .",
    "we have checked that the jacobi elliptic functions are also exact solutions to this model .",
    "one can derive recursion relations like eqs .",
    "( [ c3]),([c4]),([c5 ] ) which have a similar structure but the conjugations and a sign appear differently .",
    "this is discussed in some details in appendix b.    in order to study the stability of the solutions further , we have initiated the integration with the exact solutions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] but with the addition of a small force . as is seen form the simulation ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) , the solution starts out to be stable , looking very similar to the exact solution , however in the long run also become unstable and chaotic .",
    "nevertheless , we have observed numerically that the existence of this transition depends very much on the value of the added forcing @xmath6 .",
    "for some values of @xmath6 , the solutions remain stable although slightly changed away from the exact solutions . for other values of @xmath6",
    "we observe the scenario depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "we shall not elaborate further on these transitions in the present paper .",
    "it is well known for the goy shell model that at the parameter value @xmath200 the enstrophy @xmath201 is a conserved quantity .",
    "this point therefore corresponds to two - dimensional turbulence with a forward cascade of enstrophy and an inverse cascade of energy @xcite .",
    "we have therefore also looked for exact solutions to the goy model with six shells at this point and by using @xmath131 and @xmath200 we obtain as before from eqs .",
    "( [ c3 ] ) , ( [ c4 ] ) and ( [ c5 ] ) by use of nsolve in mathematica the following real solutions : @xmath202 with the following relations between the amplitudes @xmath122 and @xmath123 @xmath203 and the elliptic parameter @xmath2 determined by : @xmath204 of these four solutions to the 2d analogy for turbulence we have found numerically that number one , three and four on the list are unstable whereas number two is stable . as examples of this we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] some of the solutions , the ones corresponding to the second and the fourth in the list .",
    "as compared to the 3d case , we observe that the solutions in fig . [ fig:7]b become unstable even faster and that they clearly behave very chaotically .    in appendix a , we present solutions for the case of nine shells .",
    "furthermore , we derive a general recursion relation which allows to solve the @xmath198 coefficients for any number of shells .",
    "if the number of shell goes to infinity one can see from these recursion relations that the only scaling law solution behaves like @xmath205 as expected from the kolmogorov theory @xcite .",
    "we end this section by pointing out that the solutions based on the ansatz ( [ ansatz5 ] ) are special .",
    "presumably the general recursion relations ( [ recursion ] ) for the amplitudes of the jacobi functions can have more general solutions , where the constant phases could also enter the recursions . in any case",
    ", the solutions that we found represent an infinite set of solutions , since the continuous parameters @xmath206 can vary freely . alternatively , an analysis of eqs .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) , ( [ recursion ] ) shows that the free parameters are @xmath207 and @xmath123 .",
    "since these quantities in general are complex , this represents an @xmath208-continuous set of parameters .",
    "we have derived a series of exact analytical solutions to the goy shell model in the absence of forcing and viscosity . in this model",
    "a shell couples to nearest and next - nearest neighbor shells and the very construction of these couplings directly suggest that the solutions should be formulated in terms of jacobi elliptic functions .",
    "we have presented closed form jacobi solutions in the case of three shells at which point the goy model is completely integrable and possesses a continuous infinity of stable solutions .",
    "we have further derived exact recursion relations for the amplitudes of the elliptic functions in case of 6 , 9 , 12 etc shells which is related to the period three symmetry of the goy model .",
    "some of these solutions are stable and others are unstable . in the last cases the trajectories lie on chaotic energy surfaces .",
    "this picture of an infinity of solutions , some either periodic or quasi - periodic and others chaotic is common for hamiltonian systems where the trajectories will move on surfaces of constant energy .",
    "our results therefore complement the picture presented for the goy model with forcing and viscosity obtained in @xcite where long periodic unstable solutions are found embedded in the large dimensional phase space of the dynamics of a goy model with many shells . in this limit of many shells",
    "we have found solutions that behave according to the kolmogorov scaling theory for energy spectra , which shows the physical relevance of our periodic solutions .",
    "indeed , we have also observed that adding a small force , thus destroying the hamiltonian property of the system , changes the solutions . some of them are destabilized but some might remain periodic even when a force is added .",
    "the case of a forced goy model is closer to a realistic system for turbulence and it is for future research to investigate how our solutions might be relevant for a turbulent state when a true energy cascade over many scales is present .",
    "we are very grateful for discussions with leo kadanoff on shell models with few shells , which initiated this work .",
    "also we really appreciate the many very constructive comments by bruno eckhardt .",
    "in this appendix we shall discuss the case of nine shells . following the same procedure as in the main text",
    "we obtain ( the equations for @xmath209 are the same as before , but for completeness we include the @xmath210 eq .",
    "( [ c3 ] ) below ) : @xmath211 @xmath212 and @xmath213 and @xmath214 and @xmath215 as well as @xmath216 these coupled equations can be solved using the simple mathematica program ( @xmath217 ) @xmath218 , \\label{program}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the notation is @xmath219 one obtains 32 solutions , some of which are complex , and some which leads to @xmath220 .",
    "only seven of these solutions are acceptable .",
    "the reader who is interested in the actual numbers should just run the above program . increased accuracy",
    "can be obtained by putting @xmath221 at the end of the square bracket in ( [ program ] ) , where @xmath222 is the number of wanted decimals .    for the @xmath190s we can also obtain in general recursion relations by use of eq .",
    "( [ recursion ] ) . defining @xmath223 if @xmath224 mod(3),@xmath225 if @xmath226 mod(3 ) and @xmath227 if @xmath210 mod(3 ) , we obtain for @xmath228 @xmath229 where we defined @xmath230 . here",
    "( @xmath231 ) @xmath232 in addition there are two `` stop - equations '' : suppose we stop at the number of shells @xmath233 , then we must satisfy that @xmath234 and @xmath235 , which lead to the two equations @xmath236 and @xmath237 by means of eqs .",
    "( [ ka ] ) , ( [ kb ] ) and ( [ kc ] ) it is easy to write down the relevant equations for any number of shells .",
    "the remaining problem is the numerical solution of these equations .",
    "we are not able to show the existence of acceptable solutions in general , but have checked that they exist for six and nine shells .    in case with an infinite number of shells , @xmath238 , the `` stop - equations '' ( [ kb ] ) and ( [ kc ] ) should of course not be applied",
    "so we are left only with eq .",
    "( [ ka ] ) . if we make the ansatz @xmath239 , then the only solution is @xmath240 which is fully consistent with the kolmogorov theory for turbulence . the first term in eq . ( [ ka ] )",
