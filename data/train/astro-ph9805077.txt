    "the low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) gx3540 ( = 4u172834 ) is a well - known x - ray burster ( e.g. basinska et al .",
    "1984 ) which has been classified as an atoll source based on _ exosat _ data ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) . despite its detection in both soft and hard x - ray bands ,",
    "its orbital period is still unknown .",
    "hri and infrared observations , grindlay & hertz ( 1981 ) claimed the association of gx3540 with a heavily reddened globular cluster .",
    "however , the existence of this cluster was not confirmed by later infrared observations ( van paradijs & isaacman 1989 ) .",
    "apart from the bursting activities , gx3540 also exhibits complex behaviour on short time scales .",
    "quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) at 363 hz ( 2.75 ms ) during the burst itself were recently discovered by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) ( strohmayer , zhang & swank 1996 ; strohmayer et al .",
    "1996a ; 1996b ) providing the first evidence for a millisecond spin period in lmxb .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of these temporal and spectral characteristics can be found in strohmayer et al .",
    "gx3540 is likely to be a typical lmxb and can be considered as a burster involving a rapidly rotating neutron star .    however , with no optical or infrared counterpart having yet been determined , because of the high extinction in this direction as well as the presumably large distance , there are few constraints on the nature or evolutionary state of gx3540 .",
    "we therefore decided to exploit the long - term monitoring capabilities of the asm on both the _ ariel 5 _ and _ rxte _ satellites in order to study the x - ray behaviour of this source on timescales of weeks to months . in this way",
    "we could search for long - term ( super - orbital ) periods similar to those seen in other bright lmxbs , such as cyg x2 and x182030 ( e.g. smale & lochner 1992 ) , and which might be related to either the accretion geometry , disc or neutron star properties .",
    "the all sky monitor ( asm ) ( levine et al . 1996 ) on board the _ rxte _ ( bradt , rothschild & swank 1993 ) consists of three wide - angle shadow cameras equipped with proportional counters that provide regular and almost continuous intensity measurements of most bright x - ray sources in three different energy bands ( 1.53 , 35 and 512 kev ) .",
    "the time resolution allows the asm to cover 80@xmath1 of the sky every 90 minutes .",
    "combined with a 40@xmath1 duty cycle ( levine et al .",
    "1996 ) , any given source is usually scanned 510 times per day .",
    "both individual dwell and one - day average light curves are made available via the www by the _",
    "asm team . here",
    ", we use the dwell data in studying the detailed long - term light curve of gx3540 .    in this analysis",
    ", we used 6550 measurements of gx3540 which were made by the _",
    "asm from 1996 february to 1998 february ( see fig .",
    "1a ) .",
    "the _ ariel 5 _ asm experiment ( holt 1976 ) consisted of a pair of x - ray pinhole cameras with position sensitive proportional counters ( 36 kev ) that covered 75% of the sky during each orbit ( @xmath0100mins ) . from the archival heasarc _ ariel 5 _ database , we obtained 2142 data points on gx3540 spanning the period from october 1974 to march 1980 ( see fig .",
    "the _ rxte _ asm light curve of gx3540 ( fig .",
    "1a ) shows substantial flaring activity , with count rates peaking at @xmath0 26 asm counts s@xmath2 . in order to search for periodic phenomena in the data set , we used two different methods : the lomb - scargle periodogram ( lomb 1976 ; scargle 1982 ) and phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ; stellingwerf 1978 ) . the lomb - scargle periodogram is a modification of the discrete fourier transform which is generalized to the case of uneven spacing .",
    "however , it is most sensitive in those cases where any modulation present is sinusoidal .",
    "pdm is suitable even where the data is non - sinusoidal and works by dividing the data into phase bins and minimizing the dispersion within the bins .",
    "the deepest minimum relates to the period of the strongest modulation .    by applying the lomb - scargle periodogram to the _ rxte _ asm data ,",
    "a distinct peak is found at 71.7 days .",
    "we determined the uncertainties on this period by generating 10,000 artificial data sets with the same variance , amplitude and period as the true data .",
    "the distribution in the resulting peaks leads to an error in the true period of @xmath0 0.5 d ( 1@xmath3 ) . in fig .",
    "1b ( _ upper panel _ ) we plotted the 99% significance level .",
    "this is determined by generating noise data sets with the same time intervals and variance as the true data and then performing the lomb - scargle periodogram on the resulting data sets .",
    "the peak power in each periodogram ( which must be purely due to noise ) was then recorded .",
    "this was also repeated 10,000 times for good statistics .",
    "we conclude that our peak at 71.7 days is highly significant .",
    "this result is also independently confirmed by the pdm analysis ( fig .",
    "1b , _ lower panel _ ) .",
    "we note , however , that the deepest minimum occurs at @xmath0 117 days , but this is due to observation gaps in the _ rxte _ asm light curve ( fig .",
    "the folded light curve of our _ rxte _ asm data on the period of 71.7 days is shown in fig .",
    "1c ; phase zero is defined by the first data point .",
    "the _ ariel 5 _ asm data do not show the variation as clearly as the _ rxte _ asm data , but some modulation can be discerned .",
    "we note that there are various data gaps which will affect the window function .",
    "both the lomb - scargle periodogram and pdm ( fig .",
    "2b , _ upper and middle panels _ ) show a peak near 365 days , which is due to the yearly variation in the count rate from solar x - ray scattering or fluorescing from the earth s atmosphere ( priedhorsky , terrell & holt 1983 ) .",
    "the second strongest peak is at 63 @xmath4 0.1 days ( 1-@xmath3 level ) and lies well above the 99% confidence level .",
    "the window function is also shown ( fig . 2b , _ lower panel _ ) to indicate the alias periods that would be induced by the yearly variation and observation gaps .",
    "2c shows the folded light curve of the _ ariel 5 _ asm data on the period of 63 days , where phase zero is defined by the first data point .",
    "we also analysed the data from the _ vela 5b _ xc ( conner , evans & belian 1969 ) which monitored the sky from 1969 may to 1979 june in the 312 kev band .",
    "however , due to the low sensitivity of this instrument , no variability was detectable .",
    "we have detected a 71.7 @xmath4 0.5d periodicity in the _ rxte _ asm light curve and a 63 @xmath4 0.1d periodicity in the _ ariel 5 _ asm light curve of the lmxb gx3540 .",
    "such a long period modulation has hitherto been rather uncommon in lmxb . from the long - term variability survey carried out by smale & lochner ( 1992 ) using _ vela 5b _ , only 3 out of 16 lmxbs ( x182030 , x191605 , cyg x2 ) were found to have long - term periods . in particular ,",
    "x182030 and x191605 have periods of 176 days and 199 days , respectively , while recent observations by _ rxte _ asm confirm the long - term period of @xmath078 days in cyg x2 ( wijnands et al .",
    "these long - term periods are designated _ superorbital _ , as the orbital periods are known for all three objects ( 11.3mins , 50mins and 9.8d , respectively ) . in massive x - ray binaries , super - orbital periods are more common .",
    "cyg x1 , ss433 , lmcx4 , her x1 and several other sources all have super - orbital periods in the range of 30300 days ( e.g. priedhorsky & holt 1987 ) .",
    "the cause of these super - orbital periods is still a subject of debate , and possible explanations include the precession of a tilted accretion disk , neutron star precession , mass transfer feedback and triple systems ( see priedhorsky & holt 1987 and schwarzenberg - czerny 1992 for more details ) .    in the case of lmxbs",
    "the _ super - orbital _ period is much more rare and there is a large spread in values of the ratio of super - orbital to orbital periods . for x182030 , x191605 and cyg x2 ,",
    "the ratio is 22100 , 5750 and 8 respectively , whereas in massive systems it is in the range of 10 to 100 ( see e.g. wijers & pringle 1998 )",
    ". the long - term variation in lmxbs may instead be due to radiation driven warped accretion discs ( e.g. wijers & pringle 1998 ) or a disc instability in the system ( priedhorsky & holt 1987 ; dubus et al .",
    ".    many orbital periods of bright galactic sources ( including gx3540 ) remain unknown mainly due to the heavy optical extinction and/or crowded regions . while the known orbital periods of lmxbs range from 11mins to @xmath010d , cygx2 and x092163 actually have long orbital periods ( @xmath010 days ) .",
    "we note that the _ rxte _ asm light curves of cyg x2 ( fig .",
    "3a ) and gx3540 are rather similar .",
    "this similarity is enhanced by our analysis of the much more extensive _ rxte _",
    "asm database of cyg x2 that is available now .",
    "the lomb - scargle periodogram shows a 69 @xmath4 0.4d period ( fig .",
    "3b ) in addition to the already noted @xmath078d period ( wijnands et al .",
    "3c shows the folded light curve of cyg x2 with a period of 69 days , where phase zero is defined by the first data point . a recent study of gx1 + 4 by chakrabarty & roche ( 1997 )",
    "has suggested that the orbital period of this source may exceed 100 days or even 260 days .",
    "however , since any orbital modulation should be uniquely stable , we conclude that our periods of 63d and 72d found for gx3540 are `` super - orbital '' and _ not _ orbital .",
    "further optical / infrared campaigns are needed to reveal its orbital period and to make further progress in this area .",
    "we are grateful to guillaume dubus for useful comments on the discussion section .",
    "this paper utilizies quick - look results provided by the _ asm / rxte _ team and data obtained through the heasarc online service of nasa / gsfc ."
