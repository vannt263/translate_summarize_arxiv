    "the study of flavor - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) interactions has been playing an important role in testing the standard model ( sm ) and probing new physics beyond the sm . as the most massive fermion in the sm",
    ", the top quark is naturally regarded to be more sensitive to new physics than other fermions . in the sm , due to the gim mechanism",
    ", the top quark fcnc interactions are absent at tree level and extremely small at loop levels . in some new physics models beyond the sm",
    "the top quark fcnc may be significantly enhanced .",
    "searching for the top quark fcnc would be a good probe for new physics .",
    "intensive activities to explore the top quark fcnc couplings have been undertaken in recent years .",
    "on the experimental side , the cdf and d0 collaborations have reported interesting bounds on the fcnc top quark decays @xcite from run 1 experiment and will tighten the bounds from the on - going run 2 experiment . on the theoretical side , various fcnc top quark decays and top - charm associated productions at high energy colliders were extensively studied in the sm @xcite , the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) @xcite and other new physics models @xcite .",
    "these studies showed that the sm predictions for such top quark fcnc processes are far below the detectable level and the mssm can enhance them by several orders to make them potentially accessible at future collider experiments @xcite .    due to its rather clean environment",
    ", the next generation linear collider ( nlc ) will be an ideal machine to probe new physics .",
    "in such a collider , in addition to @xmath0 collision , we can also realize @xmath2 collision and @xmath1 collision with the photon beams generated by the backward compton scattering of incident electron- and laser - beams @xcite . the susy induced",
    "top - charm fcnc will give rise to various processes at the nlc , i.e. , the top - charm associated productions via @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions as well as the top quark rare decays @xmath3 ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) .",
    "it is noticable that some of these processes , like the top - charm associated productions in @xmath2 or @xmath1 collision , have not been studied in the framework of the mssm .",
    "the production in @xmath2 collision may be more important than in @xmath0 collision studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "the reason is twofold .",
    "firstly , the process @xmath8 is a good probe of new physics because it is essentially free of any sm irreducible background @xcite .",
    "secondly , unlike the process @xmath9 , which is @xmath10-channel suppressed in high energy collisions , there are @xmath11- and @xmath12-channel contributions to @xmath8 and thus its cross section may be much larger at the nlc .",
    "it is also noticable that all these fcnc processes at the nlc involve the same part of the parameter space of the mssm .",
    "involves more parameters , we do not include it in our analysis .",
    "] therefore , it is necessary to perform a comparative analysis for all these processes to find out which process is best to probe the top quark fcnc .",
    "this is the aim of this article .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the mixing between top - squark and charm - squark and derive the fcnc interaction lagrangian in susy - qcd . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the @xmath13 productions in @xmath2 and @xmath1 colllisions induced by such fcnc susy - qcd interactions .",
    "numerical results for these productions at the nlc are given in sec .",
    "iv , with the comparison to @xmath13 production in @xmath0 collision and various fcnc top quark decays .",
    "finally , a brief discussion and conclusion can be found in sec . v.",
    "many popular susy models predict the flavor mixings of sfermions . for the squark sector , despite of the possible strong constraints on the down type squark flavor mixings from the low - energy experimental data , limit could enhance the fcnc @xmath14 decays by several orders @xcite and will face tests in the on - going @xmath14-factory experiments . ]",
    "the mixings between top - squark and charm - squark are subject to no strong low - energy constraints @xcite .",
    "such a mixing between top - squark and charm - squark is well motivated in low - energy supergravity models ( sugra ) @xcite . in these models",
    "squark mass matrices are diagonalized simultaneously as with the quark matrices at the planck scale .",
    "but when the terms evolve down to low energy , this diagonality is violated by radiative corrections .",
    "due to large top quark mass , at low energy it is found @xcite that the mixing between top - squark and charm - squark may be significant .",
    "note that only @xmath15 mixes with top - squark while @xmath16 does not in the approximation of neglecting charm quark mass .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the mixing between @xmath15 and @xmath17 is most likely to be large , which is proportional to a sum of some soft masses .    motivated by the above arguments , in our analysis we assume the existence of the mixing between @xmath15 and @xmath17 and parameterize the mixing as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the soft mass parameter for left - handed squark of third ( second ) generation and @xmath21 is a dimensionless parameter representing the mixing strength .",
    "@xmath21 can be calculated in terms of other parameters in a given model like msugra @xcite .",
    "but in our calculation we retain it as a free parameter in the range of @xmath22 @xcite .    considering the mixing between @xmath17 and @xmath23 and neglecting the mixing between @xmath15 and @xmath16 , we obtain the @xmath24 mass - square matrix in the basis @xmath25 : @xmath26 where @xmath27",
    ", @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the soft - breaking mass term for right - handed top - squark .",
    "@xmath31 is the coefficient of the trilinear term @xmath32 in soft - breaking terms , @xmath33 is the mixing mass parameter between @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the superpotential and @xmath36 is ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets .    the mass - square matrix in eq.([smass1 ] )",
    "can be diagonalized by a @xmath37 unitary matrix @xmath38 , which rotates the interaction eigenstates ( @xmath17 , @xmath23 , @xmath39 ) into mass eigenstates @xmath40 .",
    "such a rotation results in the fcnc in both the weak interaction sector and the strong susy - qcd sector . of course",
    ", the latter will be dominant .",
    "so in our analysis we only consider the fcnc in susy - qcd sector , given by @xmath41 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 .",
    "the susy - qcd fcnc in eq.([fcnc ] ) will induce the top - charm associated production in @xmath2 collision , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "throughout our calculations the charge conjugate production channel , i.e. , the production of @xmath43 , has also been included . neglecting the charm quark mass , the amplitude of this process",
    "is given by @xmath44 with @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 here @xmath48 denote the momentum of incoming photons and @xmath49 the momentum of outgoing top and charm quarks .",
    "the coefficients @xmath50 can be obtained by a straightforward calculation of the diagrams shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : feyman1 ] and their expressions are presented in the appendix .",
    "we checked that our results satisfy the ward identity , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we also checked that all ultraviolet divergences canceled in our results due to the unitary of @xmath38 , which is essentially guaranteed by the renormalizability of the mssm .",
    "note that when @xmath11 or @xmath12 approaches 0 , which is physically permitted , @xmath50 tend to be very large .",
    "indeed , this is the advantage of such a process over @xmath53 which has only @xmath10-channel contribution and thus is suppressed at high energy colliders .",
    "the @xmath54 production in @xmath1 collision proceeds through the process @xmath55 , where the @xmath56-beam is generated by the backward compton scattering of incident electron- and laser - beam and the @xmath57 is radiated from @xmath58 beam .",
    "the subprocess @xmath59 has the same feynman diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyman1 ] . in our calculation",
    "we use the weizs@xmath60cker - williams approximation @xcite which treats @xmath57 from @xmath58 beam as a real photon .",
    "thus the process can be approximated by the simpler fusion reaction @xmath61 and its cross section is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the probability of finding a photon with a fraction @xmath64 of energy @xmath65 in an ultrarelativistic electron and is given by @xcite @xmath66 note that there are also intermediate @xmath6-boson contribution for the process @xmath67 .",
    "however , such contributions are suppressed by the probability function of finding a @xmath6-boson in an ultrarelativistic electron @xcite and can be safely neglected .    for both @xmath2 collider and @xmath68 collider ,",
    "the photon beams are generated by the backward compton scattering of incident electron- and laser - beams just before the interaction point .",
    "the events number is obtained by convoluting the cross section with the photon beam luminosity distribution . for @xmath2 collider the events number",
    "is obtained by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the photon beam luminosity distribution and @xmath71 , with @xmath72 being the energy - square of @xmath73 collison , is defined as the effective cross section of @xmath74 . in optimum case",
    ", it can be written as@xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the energy spectrum of the back - scattered photon for unpolarized initial electrons and laser photon beams given by @xmath77 the definitions of parameters @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 can be found in @xcite . in our numerical calculation , we choose @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "for the @xmath84 collider the effective cross section of @xmath85 is defined as @xmath86    the process @xmath9 and the top quark rare decays @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) were already calculated in the literature . here for comparison we recalculated all of them .",
    "the lengthy expressions are not presented here .",
    "the relevant susy parameters all the top - charm productions and top quark rare decays are @xmath21 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath19 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 . to find out typical magnitudes of these processes , we scan over these susy parameters by requiring @xmath94 , @xmath95 gev@xcite , @xmath96 gev @xcite , @xmath97 tev and restricting other soft mass parameters to be of sub - tev scale .",
    "our scan results are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : scan1 ] and  [ fig : scan2 ] . for the productions one sees that the typical values are @xmath98 fb and @xmath99 fb and in optimum cases @xmath100 fb and @xmath101 fb . while for the process @xmath9",
    ", the cross section can only reach @xmath102 fb , one order of magnitude lower than that of @xmath8 and comparable with that of @xmath103 .",
    "the reason for this , as we pointed out before , is due to the @xmath11-channel enhancement for @xmath8 and @xmath10-channel suppression for @xmath9 . for the top quark",
    "rare decays we see that the optimum values are @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , which agree with previous results @xcite .    comparing with predictions in other models , such as r - parity violating model @xcite and the type iii two higgs doublet model@xcite",
    ", we find that the optimum value of @xmath107 in susy - qcd is larger .",
    "note that our results for @xmath108 are quite different from those in ref.@xcite where the optimum value of @xmath109 can reach @xmath110 fb .",
    "the reason for the difference is that in ref .",
    "@xcite a non - unitary flavor changing matrix is used . during our scan",
    ", we find that , only in case of a light top - squark with mass of @xmath111 gev and a large mass splitting of a few hundreds gev in squark spectrum can relative large cross sections of these processes be obtained .",
    "this is due to a gim - like cancellation which occurs in the limit of degenerate squark masses as a result of the unitarity of the rotation matrix @xmath38 .",
    "the sm and mssm predictions for the top - charm fcnc processes are summarized in table i. note that since the sm prediction for the process @xmath112 has not been done in the literature , the sm value shown in the table is calculated by us .",
    "this is an arduous work .",
    "there are 66 diagrams contributing @xmath113 in @xmath114 gauge and often the contribution from a single box diagram can be decomposed into dozens of terms . in order to avoid artificial error , we use formcalc@xcite in our calculations . from table",
    "i , we see that the mssm can enhance the cross section of top - charm associated production processes by several orders .",
    "table 1 : theoretical predictions for the top - quark fcnc processes .",
    "susy - qcd predictions are the maximum values .",
    "the collider energy is @xmath115 gev for productions .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the behaviours of the sm cross sections versus the collider energy are shown in fig .",
    "[ sm ] for three different production processes .",
    "we see that the cross section of @xmath116 drops quickly with the increase of collider energy due to the @xmath10-channel suppression .",
    "let us focus on the most important process @xmath117 and study some of its features .",
    "for example we fix @xmath118 and @xmath119 gev , and choose @xmath120 gev , @xmath121 gev for scenario i ( relatively light squarks for the third - family ) and @xmath122 gev , @xmath123 gev for scenario ii ( relatively heavy squarks for the third - family ) .",
    "the cross section of @xmath8 as a function of @xmath21 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma - del ] .",
    "this figure shows that the cross section is enhanced dramatically with the increase of @xmath21 .",
    "clearly this is due to the fact that large @xmath21 will not only enhance the mixing between top - squark and charm - squark but also enlarge the mass splitting between the squarks . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma - x ] we show the dependence of @xmath124 on @xmath125 .",
    "we see that @xmath124 increases as @xmath125 gets large .",
    "the reason is that large @xmath125 enhances the mass splitting between the top - squarks and thus lead to a weak cancellation between different feynman diagrams .",
    "the dependence of @xmath124 on @xmath126 and @xmath127 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma - mg ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma - s ] , respectively . fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma - mg ] shows that the cross section drops when gluino becomes heavier , showing the decoupling effect of the mssm .    from figs .",
    "[ fig : sigma - del]-[fig : sigma - s ] one finds that the cross section in scenario i is always larger than that in scenario ii .",
    "the reason is that scenario i has the relative light squarks for the third - family which lead to a larger mass splitting in squark spectrum .",
    "we have performed a comparative analysis for the susy - induced top - charm fcnc processes at the nlc .",
    "these processes include the top - charm associated productions via @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions as well as the top quark rare decays @xmath3 ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) , all of which involve the same susy parameters .    in the production channels the @xmath13 production in @xmath2 collision",
    "was found to occur at a much higher rate than @xmath0 or @xmath1 collision . in some part of parameter space ,",
    "the production rate of @xmath8 can reach @xmath128 fb .",
    "this means we may have @xmath129 events each year for the designed luminosity of @xmath130 fb@xmath131/year at the nlc . since the sm value of the production rate is completely negligible , the observation of such @xmath132 events would be a robust indirect evidence of susy .",
    "note that in practical experimental searches of such @xmath132 events , a careful study of backgrounds is needed . to efficiently suppress the backgrounds ,",
    "the signal events may be hurt by @xmath133 or more @xcite .",
    "using polarization at a linear collider can help to suppress the background , as analyzed in the second reference of @xcite .    in the rare decay channels",
    "the @xmath134 was found to have the largest branching ratio which can reach @xmath135 , in agreement with previous studies .",
    "although @xmath136 @xmath137 events could be produced at the nlc each year , studies @xcite showed that the sensitivity to such rare decays can only reach @xmath138 .",
    "so the mssm prediction for the branching ratio of @xmath135 is too low to be accessible at the nlc unless the designed luminosity can be further upgraded .",
    "therefore , we conclude that , to probe the susy - induced fcnc top quark interactions at the nlc , @xmath13 production in @xmath2 collision is the best channel .    note that in our analysis we assumed flavor mixing occurs between @xmath15 and @xmath17 , which is favored in sugra models .",
    "other kinds of mixings like the mixing between @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite may also be of phenomenological interest .",
    "however , we believe our conclusion will be quite model - independent since our results reflect the basic features of the processes .",
    "we thank kaoru hagiwara and tao han for very helpful discussions . this work is supported by young outstanding foundation of academia sinica .",
