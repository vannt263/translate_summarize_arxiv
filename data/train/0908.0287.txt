    "from the release of the first studies by cobe @xcite on cmbr fluctuations in 1994 , cosmology started a period of precision measurements that have re - shaped the subject .",
    "an important role in the current understanding of the cosmological model is played by inflation @xcite ; the so called earlier stage after the big bang where the universe expands at a quasi exponential rate . although inflationary models have proven to be a very successful tool for cosmology ,",
    "nobody knows why this period started .",
    "we only know how this finished , evolving in a strong non - adiabatic and out - of - equilibrium phase , called _",
    "reheating_. because inflation started at times as early as @xmath0 , it is not difficult to believe that inflation is a natural output coming from a grand unified theory ( gut ) holding at planck scale .",
    "so , we have no any idea of how inflation started , because we can not say anything about such a theory",
    ". however , t hooft @xcite proposed a crucial feature for that theory : it has to be holographic .",
    "the idea of holography is the following : if we want to reconcile quantum mechanics with gravity , we have to assume that the observable degrees of freedom of the universe are projections coming from a two - dimensional surface , where the information is stored . during many years",
    "there has been interest in the relation between holography and string theory @xcite . the seminal work of bekenstein @xcite ( see also @xcite ) on the universal upper bound on the entropy - energy ratio for bounded systems suggested the idea of a holographic universal ( hp ) principle that can be applied to cosmology .",
    "in this context , fischler and susskind @xcite proposed a holographic principle and studied its consequences for the standard model of cosmology . from that time",
    "there has been a lot of work that attempts to refine the original proposal of fischler and susskind ( fs ) .",
    "this search has tried to come up with a hp which does not conflict with inflation and cosmology in general . in @xcite",
    "works on this line can be found . because the fs proposal was based on adiabatic evolution and failed for closed friedman - robertson - walker ` cosmologies ' , the interest was both extend the study to non - adiabatic evolution ( as reheating after inflation ) and try to include the closed case .",
    "the current understanding based on these studies implies that this universal principle does not constraint inflation . in ref.@xcite",
    "the authors propose to replace the hp by the generalized second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the same idea was developed in @xcite , where the authors explicitly discussed the problems of the fs proposal applied to inflationary models .",
    "more recently , the subject has turned into its implication in dark energy models . in @xcite",
    "the author proposed a cosmological model where dark energy can be accommodated within an holographic principle , not only explaining the order of magnitude of dark energy but also its equation of state @xcite . in general , holography has been used mainly in attempts to adequately formulate an hp in cosmology .",
    "however , because the hp must be considered a universal principle of a higher status than inflation , in this work i look for a solution to the problem considering a different point of view : an attempt to derive inflation from the hp .",
    "this is so because we expect the hp , to come from a ( so far unknown ) gut theory , and then i will analyze if this new point of view may constraint any inflationary model . from this declaration of principles , it is clear that we do not find the current beliefs very informative because inflation and the hp are considered ( almost ) independent processes .",
    "a first approach to this goal was presented in @xcite , where i proposed a model where inflation emerges from the saturation of the hp in a closed frw universe .",
    "the analysis was made taken care of being thermodynamically consistent , as was stressed in @xcite in connection to the work of rama @xcite .",
    "similar thoughts has been suggested recently in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "i study a model where inflation can be interpreted as a response to protect the violation of the hp _ a la _ fs , taking care of the role of the curvature , and considering the non - adiabatic process of reheating after inflation .",
    "i discuss the case of a closed universe , which is apparently weakly favored by observations @xcite , with both radiation and a real scalar field @xmath1 . at early times",
    "i found that an imminent violation of the hp forces the system to saturate it through a period of exponential growth of the scale factor . also , i discuss the possibility to explain additional exponential expansions phases like the one observed now .    the results of a numerical integration of the evolution from inflation to the present are shown in figure 1 . the key ingredient to have an additional phase of accelerated expansion",
    "is reheating .",
    "the extremely efficient transfer of energy from the scalar field to radiation enables us to obtain a radiation - dominated phase with a vanishing small ( but not zero ) relic of @xmath2 fields .",
    "the mechanisms through which this relic can be produced has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "this relic does not confront observations because the universe remains almost flat ( until very small redshift ) and during matter domination , it is subdominant ; however , it can dominate the matter contributions for @xmath3 .",
    "the holographic principle of fishler and susskind is reviewed in section ii .",
    "i present the model in section iii and develop the formulae to treat reheating in section iv .",
    "the effect of protection of the hp is discussed in section v , and the possibilities to have another phase of accelerated expansion is discussed in section vi using the effect of plasma masses .",
    "the paper ends with a discussion .",
    "let us assume a closed homogeneous isotropic universe with metric @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the azimuthal angle of @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the solid angle parametrizing the two - sphere at fixed @xmath5 .",
    "the particle horizon is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a reference initial time . because integral ( [ horiz ] ) may diverge at small @xmath10 , a natural choice is to take @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the angle @xmath12 determines the coordinate size of the horizon , which defines a bounded area and volume .",
    "because the entropy density @xmath13 is constant , the entropy area ratio gives @xmath14 as the universe evolves , ratio ( [ s / a ] ) increases and the system reaches a stage of saturation and later , a violation of holographic principle @xcite . for example , for a universe filled with non - relativistic matter , @xmath15 so for its maximal expansion @xmath16 ratio ( [ s / a ] ) becomes violated .",
    "i model the universe as filled with both , a single scalar field - inflaton @xmath2 - and a fluid of relativistic particles with energy density @xmath17 . assuming a homogeneous field with a slowly - time - dependent equation of state @xmath18 , where @xmath19 we can write the friedman equation as @xmath20 ,   \\label{hubble}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the scale factor and the hubble parameter in an arbitrary reference time @xmath23 ( often taken to be the present time ) . also , we have defined the following parameters : the density parameter @xmath24 for the @xmath25 component with initial energy density @xmath26 ; the critical density @xmath27 , the equivalent energy density due to curvature @xmath28 ; and the planck mass @xmath29gev .",
    "because i am considering a pressure density ratio in the range @xmath30 , this implies that at some time @xmath31 the first term in the square brackets of ( [ hubble ] ) will dominate over the other contributions , starting a period of ` inflationary expansion ' ( if we also have @xmath32 ) .",
    "this exponential expansion leads to a process of ` flattening ' of the universe due to the screening of the curvature term .",
    "the authors of @xcite used the latter effect to obtain an apparent spatially flat frw universe by using a closed one .",
    "if we extend the evolution to the present ( i.e. , at @xmath23 ) , the evolution of the system leads to a total density parameter @xmath33 because @xmath34 when we evaluate it today .",
    "globally , the effect agrees with the results of @xcite , which to solve the violation problem of the hp bound for a closed universe , introduced an ` exotic fluid ' - as the inflaton here - as an extra matter component .",
    "however , the presence of this component leads to a period of non - adiabatic evolution @xcite , so the equations of motion must be corrected to consider entropy production during the reheating process . the simplest way to do that is to consider - as a first approximation - the perturbative regime of reheating which was described by adding a friction term to the inflaton equation of motion @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "i have taken into account the most efficient energy transfer possible , based on the main results of the modern reheating theory @xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite kaloper and linde concluded that the proposal of fischler and susskind does not confront inflation , because it eliminates the entropy produced inside the light cone during reheating .",
    "this means that their hp is valid during adiabatic expansion . to extend the analysis through the particle creation process",
    ", we have to learn how to compute ratio ( [ s / a ] ) in a non - adiabatic stage , i.e. , during reheating .",
    "i consider the simplest model of reheating , which is based on the born approximation @xcite . here",
    ", the inflaton evolves according to @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the rate of particle production , and the evolution of the relativistic particles created is described by @xmath37 equations ( [ ieom ] ) and ( [ reom ] ) explicitly show the non - adiabatic nature of the process . if , as usual , we define the energy density and pressure by @xmath38 we can write the equation of state during the rapid oscillations phase of @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath39 as a temporal average during an oscillation by @xmath40 where @xmath41 , so @xmath42 in the special case @xmath43 ( a quadratic potential ) , this equation describes the decay of a massive particle .",
    "a solution of this equation is @xmath44 ,   \\label{eq4}\\ ] ] where subscript @xmath25 indicates the epoch when the coherent oscillations around the minimum of the potential @xmath45 begins , and @xmath46 is the vacuum energy at that time . if the produced particles are thermalized , we can use the expression for the entropy of radiation @xmath47 which combined with the equality @xmath48 , valid for relativistic particles and eq.([eq6 ] ) , enables us to write a relation between the energy density and the entropy @xmath49 for @xmath50 , the universe is dominated by @xmath2 particles and , according to eq.([hubble ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) , it evolves as a matter - dominated universe @xmath51",
    ". an approximated solution of ( [ reom ] ) is @xmath52 , \\ ] ] which implies that , initially @xmath17 increases from  @xmath53 to @xmath54 , and after that it decreases as @xmath55 ( see figure 1 ) . from ( [ eq9 ] )",
    "we find that the entropy grows as @xmath56 .",
    "this means that @xmath57 ( which appears in front of ( [ s / a ] ) ) is no longer constant , and has to be replaced by a function varying as @xmath58 @xmath59@xcite .",
    "let us assume that the universe starts in a radiation dominated era @xmath60 at a time near the beginning of inflation , say @xmath0 . as was discussed in section ii",
    ", such a universe will evolve towards an imminent violation of the hp .",
    "in fact , during this phase eq.([hubble ] ) can be written as @xmath61 from which we obtain the solution @xmath62 where @xmath63 . by inserting ( [ sol1 ] ) in ( [",
    "s / a ] ) , we find that the hp is violated as @xmath64 .",
    "note that in this form , the bound ( [ s / a ] ) is violated also as @xmath65 .",
    "this particular problem is solved by the arguments displayed under eq.([horiz ] ) . because @xmath66 , then it is possible to write the solution ( [ sol1 ] ) as @xmath67 , solving the hp bound ( [ s / a ] ) as @xmath65 .",
    "however , the violation in the future ( @xmath68 ) remains .",
    "now , let us follow the evolution of both ( [ s / a ] ) and ( [ hubble ] ) during the transit from radiation domination to the inflationary phase .",
    "if we assume at planck time @xmath69 that @xmath70 , then we can expect after certain time say @xmath71 , to enter an inflationary phase .",
    "in fact , because @xmath72 with @xmath30 decays more slowly than @xmath73and @xmath74 , the former dominates .",
    "if we consider the beginning of inflation when @xmath75 becomes comparable to @xmath76 , this implies that at the time @xmath77 we have @xmath78 for @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) , respectively .",
    "after @xmath75 becomes greater than @xmath81 , this component dominates the matter content in the universe and makes it inflationary in the sense that @xmath82 . here",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath83 ( [ hubble ] ) becomes nearly constant , and the coordinate size of the horizon ( [ horiz ] ) behaves like @xmath84 reaching an asymptotic constant value proportional to @xmath85 . because the scale factor grows nearly exponentially , the hp bound ( [ s / a ] ) starts to decrease , avoiding the violation in the future .",
    "a numerical integration of the system is shown in fig .",
    "specifically we plot the entropy bound ( [ s / a ] ) together with the energy density of both radiation and the inflaton field .",
    "as is shown in the figure , before the onset of inflation , the entropy bound is not saturated however this evolves towards saturation .",
    "once the violation of the bound is imminent , inflation starts modifying the evolution avoiding the violation . in this way",
    ", the appearance of inflation saves the violation of the hp in the future .",
    "for example , in the @xmath79 case , the scale factor can be written as @xmath86 ^{-2}$ ] , which behaves much like an exponential growth .",
    "the early radiation dominated phase is not necessary at all to demonstrate the role of the hp in inflating the universe .",
    "in fact , we can start the universe with a bound @xmath87 saturated at the planck era ; this time with @xmath88 .",
    "+    to solve the cosmological problems , inflation must last around @xmath89 e - folds .",
    "this means @xmath90 .",
    "this growth makes the curvature term irrelevant for the subsequent analysis , although it was fundamental at the beginning .",
    "for example , if we assume that inflation begins when @xmath91 in eq.([hubble ] ) , then after the @xmath89 @xmath92-folding we have in eq.([hubble ] ) @xmath93 , making the universe very flat . after this 60 e - folding of inflation ,",
    "particle creation starts . during this phase",
    "the formulae derived in section iv are valid , and the expression for the hp bound has to be replaced by @xmath94 which decreases more slowly than in the previous phase . because the curvature term has fallen more than @xmath95 orders of magnitude from the beginning of inflation , it seems difficult to repeat a similar argument to explain the current accelerated expansion .",
    "this possibility is discussed in the next section .",
    "after the 60 @xmath92-folding of inflation , bound ( [ s / a ] ) has fallen to a negligible small value making impossible the existence of hp saturation for another period .",
    "however , we have seen that after reheating the universe becomes radiation - dominated , and we can consider a small relic of the inflation field , which enables us to have another accelerated period .",
    "this possibility is open if the inflaton energy density does not fall more than 120 orders of magnitude during reheating . to get a viable observational model we have to consider the process of reheating once the parametric resonant phase @xcite has finished . in this new context , the study of reheating is clearly different from the standard scenario ; now the universe not only has the contribution of the coherent oscillations of the inflaton field but also the particles created during preheating .",
    "therefore , our problem is to find a mechanism that not only allows to avoid that the field inflaton decays completely , but also take into account the presence of particles created in the previous phase .",
    "in ref.@xcite i proposed a way to obtain this incomplete decay of the inflaton field . in that scenario we assumed that during the process of preheating the inflaton decay products scattered and thermalize to form a thermal background @xcite .",
    "this thermalized particle species acquires a plasma mass @xmath96 of the order of @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the typical coupling governing the particle interaction .",
    "the presence of thermal masses imply that the inflaton zero mode can not decay into light states if its mass @xmath99 is smaller than about @xmath97 .",
    "if we expressed the inflaton zero - temperature decay width as @xmath100 , at finite temperature it becomes @xmath101 the system of equations to be solved is then @xmath102 when the plasma mass @xmath103 becomes comparable to the inflaton mass @xmath99 , the temperature reaches the value @xmath104 , remaining constant for a while , indicating that particle creation stopped ; @xmath105 . at this time @xmath106 stays constant and",
    "@xmath107 decays as @xmath108 .",
    "based on observations , we have some good evidence of acceleration for @xmath109 and some preliminary evidence of deceleration for @xmath110 @xcite . if we assume that @xmath111 at @xmath112 , we can explain the current acceleration of the universe using the same field that drove inflation .",
    "because at small redshift the curvature could be relevant , we found for @xmath3 the field @xmath2 makes the universe look flat , although closed .",
    "the evolution through the matter domination to the present is very similar to what is shown in figure 1 .",
    "i have developed a consistent observational model based on the holographic principle which explains the role of inflation .",
    "it uses the hp as a relevant principle for inflation and leads to a scenario where it is possible to explain the current observation of accelerated expansion . in this way",
    "it reduces the amount of scalar fields needed to explain inflation and the dark energy .",
    "if reheating is efficient enough to change the relative weight of energy densities , it can also explain the coincidence problem .",
    "i have not used a particular potential form , using instead the inflaton equation of state as the relevant object of study . after reheating",
    ", the universe becomes radiation - dominated at @xmath113 , and the inflaton energy density remains constant during all this period , making the model consistent with nucleosynthesis and making it behave similarly to the @xmath114cdm model .",
    "a better mechanism to stopped the inflaton decay is a matter of current research @xcite , that can be adopted by our model .",
    "the main idea to get the inflation relic domination after @xmath115 , and its main quality  that of connect inflation and the dark energy with holographic properties of the universe  are of sufficient interest to deserve further study .",
    "the author wishes to thank s. del campo for valuable discussions ."
