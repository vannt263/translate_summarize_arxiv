    "the basis of the casimir effect is that introduction of a conductor into a previously empty space modifies the electromagnetic spectrum , and thus the zero - point energy .",
    "we can study this effect using the mode sum generating function @xmath0 where @xmath1 labels the modes , @xmath2 is a mode frequency for the disturbed system , and @xmath3 is a frequency cutoff .",
    "previous work @xcite has established that the mode generating function for a general spectrum of a three - dimensional system can be expanded in powers of @xmath3 in the form @xmath4 the leading terms are local quantities : the contribution is a sum over values defined for each point in space .",
    "specifically , @xmath5 is the speed of light , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are pure numbers , @xmath8 is the volume of the region , @xmath9 is the surface area of the object , @xmath10 is the surface integral of a linear combination of the surface curvatures , and @xmath11 ( the kac number ) is the surface integral of a quadratic combination of the surface curvatures . in the last term @xmath12 ( the casimir term )",
    "is a coefficient that depends inversely on a length scale that characterizes the size of the object .",
    "it is shape dependent in a way that has not been well characterized .",
    "the specific problem we study is the change @xmath13 caused by the introduction of a thin conducting surface into an initially empty space . for this problem",
    "the expansion ( [ modegenerate ] ) considerably simplifies : for empty space we have only the leading term , and since the surface does not change the volume in which the modes exist , the first term cancels out in the difference ; the third term vanishes because the surface integral is over both the inside and outside of the same surface , with oppositely directed surface elements . for electromagnetism",
    "the second term vanishes too : in the cases that have been treated previously @xcite this occurs because the `` transverse magnetic '' and `` transverse electric '' modes make opposite contributions , but balian and duplantier @xcite ( bd ) have given an argument that indicates this is a general property .",
    "the result is that the limit @xmath14 can be taken .",
    "we define the kac number @xcite @xmath15 which represents the number of modes that are created by the introduction of the object , and the casimir term @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the mode frequencies before the introduction of the conductor .",
    "thus the change in the zero - point energy is @xmath18 .",
    "the casimir term is nonlocal ( i.e. it can not be calculated as a sum of contributions from separate parts ) ; it has hitherto been known only for a few special geometries ( sphere @xcite , circular cylinder @xcite , and cylinder of elliptic cross - section @xcite ) .",
    "balian and duplantier ( bd ) @xcite have given an approach to the casimir problem that allows calculation of @xmath11 and @xmath12 for general closed conducting surfaces with bounded curvature .",
    "in this paper we will comment on their method , and use it to enrich the literature with some examples .",
    "for case of a fixed frequency , maxwell s equations can be reduced to the inhomogeneous helmholtz equation @xmath19 subject to the constraint that the field be solenoidal @xmath20 for all @xmath21 in the region .",
    "the mode frequencies @xmath2 for a finite region enclosed by a perfect conductor are those that allow a solution to these equations with no sources inside the region , subject to the boundary conditions @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a unit vector perpendicular to the surface and @xmath24 is any point on the surface .",
    "the corresponding mode fields @xmath25 form a complete orthonormal basis for the representation of solenoidal fields within the region .",
    "then in particular @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the unit tensor and @xmath28 denotes the dyadic product . for general frequency @xmath29",
    "we now consider the matrix @xmath30 regarded as a function of @xmath21 , @xmath31 satisfies the inhomogeneous helmholtz equation @xmath32 and inherits from @xmath33 the property @xmath34 and the conditions that @xmath35 and @xmath36 when @xmath21 is on the boundary .",
    "then @xmath37 is the magnetic field at @xmath21 caused by a magnetic dipole @xmath38 at @xmath24 in the presence of the conductor : it is the green function for that problem .",
    "we similarly define @xmath39 for the space in the absence of the conductor .",
    "we can see from eq.([defgamma ] ) that there is divergent response to the presence of an oscillating magnetic dipole at the resonant frequencies , as would be expected on physical grounds .",
    "regarding @xmath29 as a complex - valued variable , the green function has simple poles at the mode frequencies and is analytic elsewhere .",
    "integrating @xmath40 over all space turns ( [ defgamma ] ) to a sum of simple poles with residue @xmath41 . for @xmath29 with a small positive imaginary part this reduces to a set of delta functions @xmath42 from which the mode sum generating function can be constructed .",
    "the argument can be repeated for the region exterior to the conductor and for the whole space in the absence of the conductor , leading to the definition @xmath43\\ ] ] where the integral is over all space , so that this contains both the interior and exterior modes , and subtracts out the modes for empty space .",
    "it has the property @xmath44\\ ] ] and thus @xcite @xmath45 which motivates the further discussion of @xmath46 .      in the absence of boundaries the magnetic field due to an oscillating magnetic dipole",
    "is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the green function for the scalar helmholtz equation .",
    "when there is a conducting surface present , a surface current @xmath50 is induced which gives rise to a new magnetic field @xmath51 .",
    "thus we are led to define another green function @xmath52 @xmath53 where the integral is over the surface of the conductor , and in the second line we introduce the convention that the `` repeated index '' @xmath24 implies an integration over the surface .",
    "the surface current completely represents the effect of the conducting surface , so that the total field can be regarded as the combination of the field due to the source alone and to the field created by the induced currents , as if the fields were propagating in free space : @xmath54 note that @xmath55 depends implicitly on the location @xmath56 and orientation @xmath57 of the source .",
    "the surface provides perfect screening : when the source is inside , there are no fields outside .",
    "the tangential components of @xmath58 can be discontinuous across the boundary , due to the presence of @xmath55 .",
    "bd observe that we can use this to determine @xmath55 in the form @xmath59 here @xmath23 is directed outwards when the source is within the surface , and inwards when the source is outside .",
    "this gives a local relationship between @xmath60 and @xmath33 .",
    "the field @xmath61 is the total field due to all currents except the surface current at @xmath21 ( this exclusion is the origin of the factor of @xmath62 ) .",
    "it is defined as follows : for @xmath21 close to the surface ( at distance @xmath63 from it ) , we imagine using the first version of ( [ defm ] ) to calculate @xmath64 , but exclude from the surface integral a small region near @xmath21 that is significantly larger than @xmath63 .",
    "this part of @xmath65 is continuous as @xmath21 moves through the surface .",
    "the excluded region contributes a field that is discontinuous at the surface .",
    "the surface current ( [ defsurfacecurrent ] ) is chosen so that @xmath66 and the part of @xmath64 just computed are canceled for @xmath21 just outside the surface . in taking the limit that @xmath21 is on the surface ,",
    "the size of the `` small region '' can go to zero ; the magnetic field @xmath61 is after all the result of doing the integral ( [ defm ] ) over the whole surface .    substituting eq.([currentview ] ) gives an integral equation for @xmath55 : @xmath67 where @xmath68 describes how the magnetic field created by a current at @xmath24 induces a current at @xmath21 , and @xmath69 is the part of the surface current that is directly due to the presence of the magnetic dipole @xmath38 at @xmath24 .",
    "the useful feature of ( [ jeq ] ) is that it turns a set of three - dimensional partial differential equations for fields with three components into an integral equation for a two - component vector field living on a two - dimensional surface .",
    "this makes the numerical study of the problem greatly simpler .      the integral equation ( [ jeq ] )",
    "can be given a formal solution by repeatedly substituting it into itself , giving an expansion @xmath70 this leads to a corresponding expansion for @xmath46 @xmath71    the usual route to solving the electromagnetism problem we are considering is to find a set of fields satisfying maxwell s equations away from the boundary , then impose the boundary conditions ( [ boundary ] ) that enforce continuity of some components of the field , and only at the end ( if ever ) consider the discontinuous components that correspond to the surface currents and charges .",
    "bd reverse the process and find the surface currents first .",
    "the usual boundary conditions do not play an explicit role .    in defense of bd s approach",
    ", we observe that induction of surface currents is how the conducting surface screens the electromagnetic field , and that it necessarily establishes these currents on a local basis .",
    "bd s approach is the way that nature solves the problem .    to convince oneself that we are studying the same problem , it is useful to consider the case of spherical geometry .",
    "suppose that bd s boundary condition is not finding the correct solution .",
    "then there is a solution to maxwell s equations that has vanishing tangential components of the magnetic field at the surface , but nonzero radial magnetic field . since @xmath72 is a solution to the scalar wave equation",
    ", the surface components determine this quantity everywhere outside , in the form @xmath73 .",
    "it is then readily shown @xcite that for general @xmath29 this implies nonzero tangential components of the magnetic field , contrary to our starting assumption .",
    "although an example is less than a proof , the point is that tangential and normal components of the magnetic field are related to each other , and even in the special case of spherical geometry we can not have one without the other .",
    "the expansion ( [ jexpansion ] ) has the virtue that it turns a problem to be solved ( [ jeq ] ) into an expansion to be evaluated : the explicit form of the right - hand side of ( [ jexpansion ] ) is known .",
    "yet if we had been interested in the currents and fields at a particular frequency the expansion would be a terrible idea .",
    "the source emits electromagnetic waves which are scattered on every encounter with the surface , and the mode frequencies emerge from the coherence of many such scatterings , giving a divergent response @xmath55 .",
    "this would appear in this representation as a consequence of the failure of the expansion to converge . however , the expansion works fine for the intended application : when we chose the contour for eq.([nocontour ] ) to lie along the imaginary frequency axis ( and then closing at infinity ) , the various green functions have exponential decrease with distance and the sum is rapidly convergent .",
    "it will turn out that just the first nonvanishing term is a good approximation .    now returning to the evaluation of ( [ nocontour ] ) using ( [ defphi ] )",
    ", the leading term of ( [ gammaexpansion ] ) cancels .",
    "this could be anticipated from ( [ modegenerate ] ) , because the surface being introduced does not change the volume . for the remaining terms of ( [ gammaexpansion ] ) ,",
    "bd show that the three - dimensional integral in ( [ defphi ] ) can be done analytically to give @xmath74 where the symbol @xmath75 represents the trace over the resulting product as well as surface integrals over the variables @xmath76 , all of which are on the surface .",
    "this expression can be interpreted as a sum over all closed paths of @xmath77 sites .",
    "the sum resembles the expansion of a logarithm .",
    "a similar expression has appeared in the evaluations of the casimir energy for geometries that allow separation of variables @xcite .    on physical grounds , the poles of @xmath78",
    "should all be for real @xmath29 .",
    "then the integrand for ( [ nocontour ] ) is analytic in the upper half - plane .",
    "this allows us to choose a path of integration that goes along the imaginary @xmath29 axis to large values and then returns to the real axis along an arc at large @xmath79 .",
    "writing @xmath80 , we find that @xmath81 and @xmath82 have no imaginary part on the @xmath83 axis . combining ( [ defk ] ) , ( [ defm ] ) , and ( [ defgreen0 ] ) , the explicit form of @xmath81 is @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the outward normal to the surface at @xmath87 .    despite the singularity at @xmath88 , the integral of this expression",
    "is not divergent , because in that limit both @xmath89 and @xmath90 are tangent to the surface and thus perpendicular to @xmath86 ; then @xmath91 is vanishing like @xmath92 , leaving an integrable @xmath93 singularity .    for every closed path of sites on the surface ,",
    "there is a corresponding one in which the sites are traversed in reversed order .",
    "physically we might expect these paths to have related values , but the dependence of @xmath81 on @xmath89 suggests that reversing the path will reverse the sign of each factor in ( [ defphi1 ] ) , leading to a cancellation when there is an odd number of sites . for this reason only the even @xmath77 terms need be considered . since @xmath81 is not symmetric under exchange of labels , the perfect cancellation of odd - numbered terms is not obvious ; however , we believe it holds",
    ".    bd give a slightly different argument for the vanishing of the @xmath94 with @xmath77 odd .",
    "having calculated the casimir term using the magnetic green function , they calculate it again using the electric green function , and find that the odd terms appear with reversed sign . however , these must agree , since knowledge of the magnetic fields completely determines the electric fields . thus the odd terms must vanish .",
    "the frequency derivative that appears in the definition of @xmath94 gives @xmath77 terms that differ only in the labeling ( and thus are numerically equal ) , in which one of the @xmath81 factors is replaced by @xmath95    when @xmath29 has a large positive imaginary part , @xmath81 is exponentially small except when @xmath96 is small .",
    "these implies that for large @xmath79 , @xmath97 ( and higher - order @xmath98 ) vanishes for large @xmath29 , while @xmath99 takes on a constant value that can be calculated by the surface integral over a combination of the principle curvatures @xmath100 of the surface ( the explicit expression is given below ) .    according to ( [ kacnumber ] ) and ( [ nocontour ] ) ,",
    "the kac number is given by @xmath101 the integrand is analytic in the upper half - plane , so we can choose the contour that goes from the origin along the imaginary @xmath29 axis , and then returns to the real axis along an arc at large @xmath79 .",
    "the integrand is real on the first part of the contour and thus makes no contribution ; it is @xmath102 on the arc , which leads to the conclusion @xmath103 .",
    "it is significant that the integral exists , because this implies that we can take the limit @xmath14 in eq.([modegenerate ] ) : in the expansion of @xmath104 in powers of @xmath3 , the first three terms vanish . in contrast",
    ", a scalar field theory would surely have a nonvanishing second term , implying a contribution to the surface tension coming from vacuum fluctuations of the field @xcite .    in the large @xmath83 limit the only contribution to ( [ explicitk ] ) comes from small separations , so that @xmath105 can be calculated from the curvature elements of the surface .",
    "explicitly , @xmath106 the second term reduces to the gauss - bonnet integral , which is a topological invariant : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the genus of the surface ( @xmath109 for singly connected surfaces ; @xmath110 for the torus ) .",
    "we observe that ( [ kacnumberresult ] ) is positive for all singly connected surfaces : the introduction of a conducting surface slightly increases the number of modes . the expression is also positive for surfaces of genus 1 , however this includes zero - frequency modes that represent a magnetic field that threads the space , which properly do not belong in the kac number .    the casimir term can be evaluated using the same contour . using ( [ casimirnumber ] ) and ( [ nocontour ] ) , @xmath111 the addition of @xmath105 to the integrand does not change the integral along the real @xmath29 axis , because it is adding a real number and we only need the imaginary part ; however , upon changing the contour to the imaginary @xmath29 ( real @xmath83 ) axis , it eliminates the contribution from the arc at large @xmath79 .",
    "since @xmath112 approaches @xmath113 at large @xmath83 , the addition makes the remaining integral convergent .    for @xmath80 ,",
    "the tensors @xmath81 are real .",
    "there are an even number of these in every term of @xmath78 , and they are decreasing functions of @xmath83 . then it is expected that each of the @xmath114 will be negative valued . however , the integral of @xmath115 is usually positive , with the consequence that the casimir term will be positive .",
    "the known exception to this rule are long cylinders , where the @xmath83 integral of @xmath115 is small .    by means of the argument",
    "just presented , bd have reduced the determination of the kac number and the casimir term to the evaluation of some multiple integrals over known integrands . in section",
    "iii we will use these to determine the properties of some smooth surfaces .",
    "we note that the bd paper goes beyond these results to discuss many other things , including the case of finite temperature , surfaces with sharp creases , and to verify that the expressions are consistent with the results for the parallel planes , cylinder , and sphere geometries calculated by other approaches .",
    "routes to the calculation of the casimir interaction between objects have been given previously@xcite .",
    "we believe these all develop along the same lines , differing mainly in notation and in how the authors propose to turn their formal results into numerical values .",
    "we note that the self - interaction case is slightly more complicated that the case of interaction between separate objects in that it needs the subtraction of @xmath116 that appears in eq .",
    "( [ casimirresult ] ) .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath98 ( eq.([defphi1 ] ) ) requires @xmath77 integrals over the surface ; the result ( [ casimirresult ] ) is the integral over @xmath83 of the sum of the @xmath114 .",
    "these integrals are sufficiently complicated to defy analytic treatment , which is undoubtedly why bd s method has attracted so little attention .",
    "however , they are tractable as numerical integrals .    a surface integral of a function @xmath117 can be written as an integral over the solid angle and estimated ( `` monte carlo integration''@xcite ) as an average over a large set of unit vectors @xmath118 chosen randomly with uniform distribution of orientations @xmath119 where @xmath120 represents an integral over solid angles and @xmath121 is the weight function that translates solid angle into surface area , given by @xmath122 then we can use ( [ defmc ] ) to calculate the area of the surface @xmath123 and the kac number @xmath124    evaluation of the @xmath98 requires a little more care , however .",
    "the integrands are exponentially small when @xmath125 , and are strongly peaked near the cases where all the points are close to each other .",
    "evaluation of the @xmath77-fold surface integrals by choosing @xmath77 uncorrelated directions @xmath126 will give many small values and a few very large ones ; the average ( [ defmc ] ) will not have good statistics , especially when @xmath83 is large .",
    "the resolution of this problem@xcite is choose the random vectors @xmath126 from a joint distribution that emphasizes the small separation case , with a corresponding weight function @xmath127 .",
    "this can be viewed as a change in variables in the integration .",
    "for example , consider the integral @xmath128 in the first form , the integrand becomes arbitrarily large , and evaluating it by choosing uniformly distributed @xmath129 is not going to work well ; in the second form randomly sampling @xmath130 and @xmath131 is not a uniform distribution on the sphere , but the integrand is bounded ( now regarding the @xmath132 to be part of the integrand ) .",
    "consider first @xmath99 . according to ( [ defphi1 ] ) ,",
    "( [ explicitk ] ) , and ( [ explicitderk ] ) it has the form @xmath133 the integrand appears to be divergent for @xmath134 ( that is , when @xmath135 and @xmath136 are close to each other ) ; however , in this limit @xmath89 almost lies in the surface and thus is nearly perpendicular to the surface normals @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "the result is that the integrand is bounded .",
    "calling the integrand @xmath139 , the integral can be rewritten as an integral over solid angles @xmath140 where in the second equation we have written @xmath141 in terms of the spherical angles relative to the direction @xmath142 .",
    "the second form of the integral suggests that we can evaluate it by averaging over @xmath143 randomly and uniformly distributed ( thus making the factor @xmath144 part of the integrand ) ; however , the integrand is exponentially small for @xmath145 , so that only the region of small @xmath146 is important .",
    "this is equivalent to the region of small @xmath131 , since @xmath147 in this limit .",
    "therefore we replace @xmath131 by a new variable @xmath148 defined by @xmath149 which has the features that @xmath150 corresponds to @xmath151 , @xmath152 corresponds to @xmath153 , and for @xmath154 , @xmath155 means @xmath156 ( and thus @xmath131 small and @xmath157 ) .",
    "it follows from these properties that changing variables from @xmath131 to @xmath148 gives a new integral for which the integrand makes significant contribution over about half the range of integration .",
    "randomly sampling @xmath148 and @xmath130 involves averaging many numbers of about the same size , where randomly samply @xmath131 and @xmath130 would be the average of a few very large numbers and many small ones .    calculating the other @xmath98 benefits from this same idea , because in the large @xmath83 limit the contribution is dominated by the configurations for which all of the @xmath118 are close to each other .",
    "the casimir term is an interaction between different parts of a surface ( rather than a sum of local contributions , like the kac number ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath158 is a length which in some way characterizes the size of the object , but it does not seem to be related to the obvious metrics , such as the ratio of volume to area or the root - mean - square separation of points on the surface or the surface integral of the average curvature .",
    "we give examples for various shapes in the next section ; we find that the leading term @xmath159 usually is the most important contribution , so that the casimir term is almost the result of a pairwise interaction between points on the object .",
    "the explicit form for the casimir term given by bd is sufficiently complicated that it is difficult to anticipate what features of a surface contribute to it .",
    "this led us to construct a geometric quantity @xmath160 that is similar to @xmath161 over a wide range of geometries .",
    "the effect of the tensor @xmath162 ( [ defk ] ) vanishes when the surfaces at @xmath21 and @xmath24 belong to the same plane , because in this case the field created by the current at @xmath24 is perpendicular to the surface at @xmath21 and thus induces no surface current in response .",
    "this counteracts the large interaction between nearby points that might be expected .",
    "these observations suggest that curvature of the surface is important to the casimir term .",
    "we have constructed a representation capturing these properties in the form of a double integral over the surface of an integrand that depends on the separation @xmath146 of point pairs . to get the right scaling with size , the integrand must scale as @xmath163 .",
    "the example of ( [ phi2calc1 ] ) suggests one way to avoid a divergence of the integral at small @xmath146 is to have a numerator with four powers of factors such as @xmath164 .",
    "symmetry and the requirement that parallel planes attract leave few choices , and the only one that works at all well is @xmath165 the prefactor has been chosen to match the numerical results for @xmath161 in the case of a sphere of radius @xmath166 : @xmath167 .",
    "but it works reasonably well for other geometries : for parallel planes with separation @xmath168 the value of @xmath169 , to be compared with the casimir interaction @xmath170 . for the infinite cylinder ,",
    "the value of @xmath171 per unit length is zero ( as is @xmath159 ) , while the casimir term per unit length is small and negative .",
    "we ascribe no physical meaning to @xmath160 beyond that just given ; it is just a geometrical quantity .",
    "however , it is a lot easier to calculate than @xmath161 .",
    "in this section we report the numerical results for some simple shapes : ellipsoid of revolution , circular cylinder with hemispherical caps , torus , a `` drum '' ( parallel circular disks joined with part of a torus ) , and a `` cube '' with rounded corners and edges .    for comparison please recall that for a sphere of radius @xmath166 the kac number is @xmath172 and the casimir term is @xmath173 , and for an infinite cylinder of radius @xmath166 the kac number per unit length is @xmath174 and the casimir term per unit length is @xmath175 .",
    "the interaction energy per unit area of parallel planes with separation @xmath168 is given by a casimir term @xmath176 .",
    "we believe the numerical values to be accurate to the number of places given . in most cases @xmath177 is the dominant term , though we note again that for the infinite cylinder @xmath178 , so that the higher order terms are necessarily relevant .",
    "we have calculated @xmath159 , @xmath179 , and @xmath180 for all geometries , but supressed the reporting of @xmath180 when it turned out to be negligibly small .",
    "for the case of the sphere , we find @xmath181 .",
    "although this agrees well with the accepted value , we note that it is also an easier calculation than most that we report , since the radius and curvature are constant .",
