    "the nature of current accelerated expansion of the universe is one of the mysterious and interesting topics in cosmology @xcite . in order to interpret this expansion ,",
    "some various candidates have been proposed by many authors , such as cosmological constant idea @xcite , dark energy models @xcite , ( exotic substance with large negative pressure @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the dark energy density ) ) and modified gravities like lovelock gravity @xcite , brane world cosmology @xcite , scalar - tensor theories @xcite and also the so - called @xmath0 gravity theories @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , amongst the nonlinear modifications of einstein gravity , @xmath0 models seem to provide an interpretation to dark energy , the hierarchy problem @xcite , the four cosmological phases @xcite , the power law early - time inflation @xcite , late - time cosmic accelerated expansion @xcite , singularity problem arising in the strong gravity regime @xcite , rotation curves of spiral galaxies @xcite and detection of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "in addition , when one considers @xmath0 theory as a modification of general relativity , it is quite natural to ask about black hole existence in this theory .",
    "furthermore , it is notable that viable modifications in gravity should pass all sorts of tests from the large scale structure of the galaxy and cluster dynamics to the solar system tests .",
    "hence , many different models of @xmath0 theory with various motivations have been proposed ( see @xcite and references therein for more details ) .    moreover , regarding einstein gravity , one can find a large number of exact spherically symmetric solutions .",
    "one of important works in the modified theories of gravity is obtaining the static spherically symmetric solutions , a requirement usually referred to as spatial isotropy and time independence .",
    "therefore , the most widely explored exact solutions in @xmath0 gravity are the spherically symmetric solutions .",
    "spherically symmetric solutions of @xmath0 gravity have been studied before @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some of interesting black objects with various geometry have been investigated in @xmath0 gravity , for e.g. , static and rotating black hole / string solutions , magnetic string and so on @xcite .",

    "( [ sol1 ] ) and ( [ sol2 ] ) for @xmath29 and @xmath30 with arbitrary @xmath31 lead to the following solutions @xmath32 @xmath33    after some cumbersome manipulation we obtain @xmath34 \\frac{\\lambda ^{2}}{9 } \\label{riem2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which confirm that there is a singularity at @xmath35 .",
    "the position of the black hole event horizon is determined as a largest root of @xmath36 .",
    "( [ ric1 ] ) and ( [ riem2 ] ) show that the curvature scalars are asymptotically finite and related to the cosmological constant .",
    "but we can not redefine a unique effective cosmological constant for whole curvature scalars with an arbitrary @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , we could not state these solutions are asymptotically ( a)ds with an effective cosmological constant .",
    "nevertheless , the asymptotic behavior of the solutions are near to ( a)ds solutions .    here , we give a brief discussion about the stability of the mentioned @xmath0 model .",

    "furthermore , it has been shown that @xmath40 is related to the the effective mass of the dynamical field of the ricci scalar @xcite .",
    "therefore , the positive effective mass , a requirement usually referred to as the dk stability criterion , leads to the stable dynamical field @xcite .",
    "in addition , one can discuss other instability criteria of the asymptotically lifshitz spacetimes considered in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have employed the initial value problem to investigate the stability of such spacetimes .",
    "we will investigate other instability criteria for the future works and in this paper , we consider dk stability . in order to check the dk stability criterion",
    ", we should calculate the second derivative of the @xmath0 function with respect to the ricci scalar for this specific model @xmath41    the positivity of @xmath42 depends on the model parameters . in order to study the stability , we plot @xmath42 in fig .",
    "this figure shows that one may obtain stable solution for special values of @xmath31 for negative cosmological constant . in other words",
    ", we can set free parameters to obtain positive @xmath42 .",
    "it is notable to mention that since eq .",
    "( [ fe ] ) is a trivial relation for obtained solutions , we are not allowed to use the conformal transformation to discuss about the dynamic of the solutions .",

    "it may be considered a scale invariant fixed point that do not exhibit galilean symmetry with the metric of the corresponding gravity duals @xcite .",
    "these metrics exhibit an anisotropic scale - invariant field theories in which time and space scale differently @xmath43 which is characterized by the so - called dynamical exponent @xmath44 .",
    "one may obtain the standard scaling behavior of conformal invariant systems for @xmath45 .",
    "in other words , for @xmath46 , it corresponds to relativistic invariance ( the scaling is isotropic ) . also for arbitrary values of @xmath44",
    ", one can say that the system has lifshitz scaling . in some literature",
    "a special solution was found , which corresponds to the asymptotically lifshitz black hole with various dynamical exponents @xcite .",

    "( [ met1 ] ) is asymptotically lifshitz spacetime provided one apply the following transformation@xmath48 in other word , asymptotically lifshitz metric ( [ alifmet ] ) ( with the mentioned @xmath0 model ) leads to the following metric function @xmath49 where @xmath50    it is notable that the generic solution eqs .",

    "we have obtained some interesting solutions for different values of free parameter , @xmath6 , and studied the geometrical properties of the solutions .",
    "we have investigated the analogy between obtained solutions with @xmath10-dimensional solutions of einstein-@xmath53 gravity in the presence of a nonlinear source , namely power maxwell invariant ( where @xmath54 denotes its nonlinearity parameter ) .",

    "finally , we should remark that obtained solutions are interesting because of the following three main reasons : ( i ) both the geometry of the horizon(s ) and asymptotic behavior of the solutions depend on the values of free parameter @xmath6 , ( ii ) starting from pure @xmath0 gravity and extract the solutions of einstein-@xmath1-power maxwell invariant theory , ( iii ) obtained solutions are , exactly , the same as asymptotically lifshitz black holes , provided the transformation between them are chosen suitably .",

    ", we should consider @xmath71 or @xmath72 ( in other words : @xmath73 ) .",
    "in general , considering the metric ( 2 ) with @xmath74 , one can show that the curvature scalars diverge at @xmath35 with arbitrary @xmath75 .",
    "in addition , curvature scalars diverge at spatial infinity for @xmath76 . to avoid non - physical singularity ,",
    "we restrict our discussions for @xmath77 and hence we only consider @xmath78 branch ( for a discussion about the essential singularity at infinity , we refer the reader to ref .",
