    "the analysis of other charged rotating spacetimes in higher dimensions might be interesting , as well .",
    "this includes black hole solutions with horizons of spherical topology , such as the supersymmetric spacetimes @xcite or the charged rotating black holes in einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory @xcite , but also spacetimes with a different horizon topology .",
    "+ in black ring spacetimes , for instance , the equations of motion could be separated only in special cases corresponding to geodesics on the two rotational axes , or zero energy null geodesics @xcite .",
    "consequently , the geodesic motion was studied analytically as well as numerically @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in contrast to myers - perry black hole spacetimes , there are stable bound orbits in black ring spacetimes @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent analysis @xcite revealed , that such ring space - times may possess chaotic bound orbits . it should be interesting to see whether chaotic motion will also appear in further higher - dimensional spacetimes .",

    "<S> we present the complete set of analytical solutions of the geodesic equation in the general five - dimensional myers - perry spacetime in terms of the weierstrass @xmath0- , @xmath1- and @xmath2-functions . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the underlying polynomials in the polar and radial equations , which depend on the parameters of the metric and the conserved quantities of a test particle , and characterize the motion by their zeros . </S>",
    "<S> we exemplify the efficiency of the analytical method on the basis of the explicit construction of test particle orbits and by addressing observables in this spacetime . </S>"
