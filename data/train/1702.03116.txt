    "in this work , we studied the @xmath0 little string theories that are engineered from type iia / iib ns5-branes probing the @xmath1 alf space .",
    "the string dualities map the ns5-branes and the @xmath1-type alf space to the ns5-d6-o6 and ns5-on@xmath7-d6 brane systems , from which we derived the 6d effective gauge theories .",

    ", we found the fugacity map from the associated 5-brane web diagrams and confirmed the agreements between the susy partition functions for @xmath238 .    by decompactifying either direction in the 5-brane web diagrams ,",
    "the t - duality is reduced to the duality between the 6d @xmath1 conformal matter theory and the 5d affine @xmath94-type quiver gauge theory , or between the 6d @xmath239-type quiver gauge theory and the 5d orthosympletic circular quiver theory .",
    "this comes from the fact that our lsts are extensions of those two 6d @xmath0 scfts .",
    "consequently , our susy partition functions also confirmed the 5d/6d dualities studied in @xcite as byproducts .    one interesting and challenging future direction would be to study the little string theories engineered from type iia / iib ns5-branes on the @xmath240-type alf spaces .",
    "the effective gauge theories for the type iib ns5-branes are the affine @xmath241 gauge theories according to the douglas - moore construction @xcite , for which most results in section  [ subsec : iib - gauge ] can be easily extended .",
