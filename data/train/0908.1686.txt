    "the discrimination or identification of quantum states has been a constant subject of study . in recent years",
    ", the interest for this matter has been renewed due to the potential possibility of encoding and transmitting information using quantum systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , the current progress in experimental techniques has led to physical implementations of quantum information protocols aimed at identifying or discriminating quantum states @xcite .",
    "a particular strategy for discriminating among quantum states is the so called _ unambiguous state discrimination _ @xcite .",
    "this permits identifying conclusively states belonging to a set of linearly independent states @xcite with a success probability different from one .",
    "this strategy is based on the concatenation of a unitary transformation and two projective measurements .",
    "the unitary transformation acts onto both the primary system , which encodes the states to be discriminated , and an ancillary system .",
    "this transformation is designed in such a way that a measurement on the ancillary system projects with a given probability the primary system onto one of several possible mutually orthogonal states .",
    "thereby , a measurement of the primary system leads to the perfect identification of the state @xcite .",
    "unambiguous state discrimination has been proposed as basis for quantum key sharing @xcite and as a tool for improving the quality of several quantum protocols when implemented via partially entangled states such as quantum teleportation @xcite , dense coding @xcite , and entanglement swapping @xcite , concentration @xcite , and generation @xcite .",
    "unambiguous state discrimination can also be viewed as a probabilistic conclusive mapping connecting a set of initial states with non - vanishing inner products with a set of final states with vanishing inner products .",
    "one can think in a more general process consisting in a probabilistic conclusive mapping which connects two sets corresponding to initial and final states , each of them with different inner products .",
    "this general mapping is the subject of this article .",
    "recently , the mapping between sets of non - orthogonal states has been connected to the control of quantum state preparation , entanglement modification @xcite , and interference in the quantum eraser @xcite . in our study",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the case of sets of two states and we allow different a priori probabilities of the two initial states . the complex nature of the inner product between them is also taken into account .",
    "we find conditions that guarantee the existence of the mapping and we optimize its success probability .",
    "the mathematical treatment of the problem suggests to consider three different cases , which have to be analyzed separately .",
    "these cases are classified according to conditions satisfied by the absolute values and phases of the involved inner products .",
    "one of the analyzed situations corresponds to a scheme of optimal _ non - orthogonal quantum state preparation _ by starting from an orthonormal basis .",
    "we explore some applications of the mapping to quantum information theory , such as quantum deleting and quantum cloning .",
    "we compare the optimal success probability of our scheme with the one obtained via an alternative scheme using the unambiguous quantum state discrimination .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section [ section2 ] we introduce the mapping and we classify three possible solutions , which are analyzed in detail in three subsections . in section [ sectiona ]",
    "we compare this with the alternative scheme . in section [ application ]",
    "we discuss some possible applications of the mapping , and finally in section [ summary ] we summarize our results .",
    "let us consider a primary quantum system @xmath0 described by a two - dimensional hilbert space @xmath1 .",
    "this system is prepared randomly in one of the states @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , with probability @xmath4 , and then it is delivered to a third party .",
    "this third party has a complete knowledge of the states @xmath5 and its a priory probabilities , but it does not known the actual state in which the system is .",
    "the task of this party is to map the states @xmath5 onto the final states @xmath6 , where the initial inner product @xmath7 is in general different from the inner product @xmath8 .",
    "the mapping must be implemented conclusively , that is , it must be known with certainty when it has been perfectly carried out , and without revealing the initial state of the primary system @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the mapping must achieve the highest possible success probability .    in order to implement the mapping we consider an ancillary quantum system @xmath9 described by a hilbert space @xmath10 spanned by the orthogonal states",
    "this allows by means of a joint unitary transformation and a measurement process to project indirectly states @xmath5 onto states @xmath6 in a probabilistic way .",
    "we assume that there exists the joint unitary operator @xmath12 such that    @xmath13    [ transformation ]    where the ancillary system @xmath9 is initially prepared in a known , arbitrary state @xmath14 . since the states @xmath11 are orthonormal , a measurement of the ancilla on this basis projects the initial state @xmath2 onto the state @xmath15 with probability @xmath16 or onto the state @xmath17 with probability @xmath18 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "thus , the total success probability @xmath19 of mapping the set of states @xmath5 onto the set of states @xmath6 is given by @xmath20 analogously , the total success probability @xmath21 of mapping the set of states @xmath5 onto the states @xmath22 is @xmath23 .",
    "we have denoted the inner product @xmath24 by @xmath25 . in this way",
    ", the mapping enables us to transform a pair of states with a given inner product @xmath26 into a new pair of states with an inner product @xmath27 fixed in advance .",
    "we could have chosen @xmath28 , but our aim is to study the most general situation where @xmath29 .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that if the process @xmath30 is successful , then the probability that the system @xmath0 is in @xmath15 is @xmath31 our study centers in the optimization of the success probability @xmath19 , however , a particular application of this scheme could require to focus on the probabilities @xmath32 instead of @xmath19 . for instance , the requirement of that @xmath33 imposes conditions that not necessarily optimize @xmath19 .",
    "the unitarity of @xmath12 constrains the values of the complex parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath25 through the equations    @xmath34    [ c ]    we resort to a polar decomposition of each inner product , that is , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . eqs .",

    "we note that the roles of @xmath27 and @xmath25 are similar , this means that the desired inner product could be codified indistinctly in the outcome sets @xmath6 or @xmath22 .",
    "a general analysis of the eqs . ( [ c ] ) leads us to distinguish three cases , which we shall study separately .",
    "in the first case we assume that all constrains ( [ subeqc ] ) are satisfied . in the second one , we lift one of the constrains ( [ const2 ] ) by assuming @xmath40 , which implies that @xmath41 , so that one of the conditions ( [ const3 ] ) do not hold . in the third case",

    "according to these inequalities it is not possible to get inner products smaller than the initial @xmath58 in both outcomes .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with the impossibility of the @xmath59 deterministic cloning process , since in this case we would have @xmath60 for @xmath61 , which implies @xmath62 for @xmath61 , being in contradiction with eqs .",
    "( [ abg ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", we have to stress that according to the conditions ( [ abg ] ) it is permitted that @xmath63 , this is , the absolute value of an inner product can be deterministically increased .",
    "this is a remarkable result when the phase of the outcome inner product it is not relevant .",
    "we notice that the phases @xmath64 and @xmath65 can not be equal , as follows from the conditions ( [ const3 ] ) .",

    "this effect can be visualized in the particular case in which @xmath80 , with @xmath81 . assuming a maclaurin serie of @xmath75 up to first order in @xmath82 we obtain @xmath83 where the plus ( minus ) sign has to be considered when @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) . from this expression",
    "it is clear that the success probability could be increased or decreased depending on the sign of @xmath86 and on @xmath65 through the function @xmath87 .",
