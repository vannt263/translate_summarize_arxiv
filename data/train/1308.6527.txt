    "density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite has become a powerful tool for physicists and chemists to describe the electronic structure of atoms , molecules , and solids . while being exact in theory , practical applications of dft rely on approximations of the exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional . the local spin density approximation ( lsd ) @xcite is in most cases too crude an approximation for the study of molecular systems .",
    "functionals based on the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite allow for a more accurate description of the inhomogeneous electron densities of molecules but also turn out not to be accurate enough in many cases .",

    "while this orbital based estimate can not be expected to eliminate all self - interaction for many - electron systems , it may improve the accuracy of approximate functionals .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to test the accuracy of pz - sic for a few commonly used functionals when applied to molecules .",
    "errors in the energy due to approximation of the xc - functional stem from both an incomplete cancellation of the electron self - interaction and an inaccurate description of the inter - electronic interaction .",
    "the accuracy of the pz - sic does , therefore , depend on the functional approximation it is used with . from earlier studies ,",
    "it was concluded that pz - sic often overcorrects errors in calculated observables of many - electron systems such as equilibrium bond lengths and atomization energy .",

    "the effective potential will not be the same for all orbitals and this places sic outside the domain of kohn - sham dft .",
    "it can be treated as a true kohn - sham functional by means of the optimized effective potential method ( oep ) @xcite , but in many applications the functional is treated in the generalized kohn - sham framework , i.e. , the energy is minimized with respect to variation of the orbitals , resulting in different potentials for each one of them .",
    "analytical gradients of the energy of sic functionals have been derived @xcite and can be used in a direct minimization of the energy .",
    "the efficiency can be improved by an additional step in the iterative minimization . before the orbitals are altered according to the energy gradient , the unitary transformation that minimizes the sic energy terms is found .",
    "by such a ` unitary optimization ' the convergence rate can be greatly improved  @xcite .",

    "the bond length decreases for sic/2 and agrees better with the reference value , but then increases for pbe+sic , while hardly changing for blyp+sic . for the functionals studied here , the gga+sic/2 barriers give the best results , being more accurate than the hybrid functionals . for this reaction , in contrast to the hydrogen barriers ,",
    "different results are obtained when using real orbitals . here",
    ", the bond length is larger and the barrier height is slightly lower than for complex orbitals .",
    "these three barriers describe bond breaking situations and are underestimated by the uncorrected functionals .",
    "the ammonia inversion is qualitatively different , as bonds merely rearrange and their lengths at equilibrium and saddle point do not differ significantly .",
    "the calculated bond lengths in the planar configuration are elongated by less than 2 pm compared to the equilibrium structure @xcite .",
    "the inversion barrier calculated with the uncorrected functionals is in good agreement with the reference , but the bonds are predicted to be too long .",
    "the bond length decreases and the barrier increases with sic for lsd , but for the gga functionals the barrier is lowered and becomes underestimated . using real orbitals , on the other hand , the barrier increases strongly .",
    "this qualitatively different effect of sic can be explained by the structure of the ` lone pair , ' as was done for the methyl radical . for the planar molecule ,",
    "the orbitals of both spins look very similar to those in figure [ fig : ch3_orbitals ] . for the complex orbitals , spin up and spin down orbitals",
    "are rotated with respect to each other by 120@xmath30 . in the real case ,",
    "the spin - up and spin - down orbitals are symmetric with respect to reflection through the plane . as for , this configuration of the real orbitals is higher in energy than that of the complex orbitals , which explains the large difference in the predicted energy barrier .        as for the atomization energy , the errors in the calculated reaction barriers",
    "can be analyzed in greater detail by comparison of the errors in total energy of the species involved .",
    "figure [ fig : total_energy_saddle ] shows the error per electron of the total energy of the saddle point structure ( * s * ) , the separated reactants ( * r * ) and that of the separated atoms ( * a * ) , calculated using pbe , pbe+sic/2 , and pbe+sic .",
    "points on the dashed line correspond to a perfect description of the total energy , the vertical difference between neighboring points corresponds to deviations in the atomization energy ( a - r ) and energy barrier ( r - s ) .    for the systems ,",
    "the pbe energy of the hydrogen atoms is quite accurate and the saddle point energy is only slightly underestimated .",
    "the underestimation of both the barrier height and atomization energy originates mainly from an inaccurate description of the hydrogen molecule .",
    "when sic is applied , the energy of the atom is lowered insignificantly and the energy of the molecule is raised slightly , making both total and atomization energy of the molecule less accurate .",
    "however , pbe+sic introduces a large error at the saddle point , which cancels the error in the molecule . for sic/2 ,",
    "the errors introduced are less well balanced and the barrier is still underestimated .",
    "the barrier is severely underestimated by the pbe functional stemming from equally large errors of opposite sign in the reactants and saddle point structure .",
    "the energy of the saddle point is predicted accurately by pbe+sic .",
    "each optimized orbital is to great extent localized at one of the hydrogen atoms and neighboring orbitals are of opposite spin . in such a configuration ,",
    "most of the exchange - correlation energy can be expected to be self - interaction energy , in which case pz - sic usually performs well . in this case",
    "the barrier is improved by sic , but as the energy of the hydrogen molecule is too high , a still significant error in the barrier remains .    for the atomic reference of hfh and , both the error in the total energy and the change when applying sic are dominated by the heavy atoms .",
    "the reduction of the error by sic is smaller for the hf molecule than for the atoms , thus making the binding energy less accurate compared to pbe .",
    "the error in the saddle point energy is increased and exceeds that of the reactants . here ,",
    "half sic gives a better cancellation of error than both pbe and pbe+sic .",
    "for the molecules , the effect is smaller and the barrier height changes only slightly .    for the reaction",
    ", we have calculated the energy along a path connecting the saddle point and the reactants .",
    "for a number of distances @xmath31 , the bond length of the fragment was relaxed . in figure",
    "[ fig : h3_relaxed ] , the relaxed energy of the lsd and pbe functionals is shown for several separations of the fragments .",
    "the leftmost points correspond to the bond length and energy barrier of the saddle point .",
    "increasing values of @xmath31 describe the separation into a hydrogen atom and a molecule . in lsd ,",
    "the combined system has lower energy than the separated fragments for all separations , the energy barrier is negative and is predicted to be a stable molecule . lsd+sic/2 and lsd+sic increase the energy and predict a reaction barrier .",
    "the height is however still underestimated and at intermediate distances , a system more stable than the reactants is found . in pbe ,",
    "no intermediate configuration is more stable than the reactants , but the energy difference is globally underestimated .",
    "pbe+sic agrees well with the ci results while the pbe0 hybrid does not describe the system as well .",
    "however , as shown in figure [ fig : total_energy_saddle ] the improved description by the pbe+sic functional results only from a better cancellation of errors and not from a better description of the system .",
    "the results presented here on the energetics of small molecules provide insight into both the strengths and the shortcomings of the perdew - zunger self - interaction correction .",
    "the qualitatively wrong equilibrium structure of predicted by pbe is corrected by sic . in the case of the radical",
    ", sic had been found to predict an incorrect geometry , but in the present study this was shown to be an artifact of a restriction to real orbitals .",
    "this molecule and the potential energy surface emphasize the importance of using sic with gga functionals to obtain more accurate results , as had already been shown in a study of the total energy of atoms  @xcite .",
    "however , not all gga functionals are suited for the application of sic .",
    "the molecule is found to be unstable when sic is applied to the blyp functional and the errors in total energy are large and unsystematic for the rest of the molecules in the test set as well as the isolated atoms .",
    "analysis of the total energy revealed that for pbe+sic , the errors per electron in the atomic systems are reduced and show less fluctuations than that of the molecules , resulting in an unsystematic effect on the atomization energy .",
    "the perdew - zunger sic does not in general result in an overcorrection when applied to pbe , as the predicted total energy is still too high .",
    "however , an overcorrection in calculated atomization energy is usually observed which can be improved by scaling the sic . the simple scaling scheme of using a constant factor of one - half for all orbitals when applied with pbe reduces the mean error in atomization energy to less than that of the pbe0 hybrid functional , but still gives significant absolute errors . for systems with only a few electrons",
    ", this half - sic approximation does not perform better than full sic in calculations of energy barriers .",
    "more flexible scaling @xcite where full sic is retained for one - electron systems or isolated orbitals could work better for such systems .",
    "these scaling schemes have so far only been used in combination with real orbitals and their performances would need to be reassessed using complex orbitals .",
