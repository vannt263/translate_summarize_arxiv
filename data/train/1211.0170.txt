    "we incorporate the fact that as time evolves more data is available for the identification of dupire s volatility surface .",
    "thus we develop an _ online _ approach to the ill - posed problem of the local volatility surface calibration .",
    "such surface is characterized by a non - negative two - variable function @xmath0 of the time to expiration @xmath1 and the strike price @xmath2 .    in what follows",
    ", we consider that the local volatility surfaces are indexed by the observed underlying asset price @xmath3 .",
    "the reason for that stems from the fact that if we try to use information of prices observed on different dates , there is no financial or economical reason for the volatility surface to stay exactly the same .",
    "thus , in principle we may have different volatility surfaces , although such change may be small .",
    "let us quickly review the standard black - scholes setting and dupire s local volatility model . recall that an option or derivative is a contract whose value depends on the value of an underlying stock or index .",

    "it is well known @xcite that , by setting the current time as @xmath8 , the value @xmath9 of an european call option with strike @xmath2 and expiration @xmath10 satisfies :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the difference between the continuously compounded interest and dividend rates of the underlying asset . in what follows",

    "the inverse problem of local volatility calibration , as it was tackled in previous works @xcite , consists in given option prices @xmath9 , find an element @xmath20 of @xmath17 such that @xmath21 in the least - square sense below .",

    "in contrast , in the present work we explore the dependence of the local volatility surface on the observed asset price in order to incorporate different option price surfaces in the same procedure of tikhonov regularization . more precisely , we consider the map @xmath25 \\mapsto c(s , a(s ) ) \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the solution of ( [ dup1 ] ) with @xmath27 and @xmath28 . moreover , @xmath29 maps @xmath30 $ ] to @xmath31 in a well - behaved way .    in this context",

    "this new setting allows incorporating more data into the calibration problem , leading to an online tikhonov regularization .",
    "we prove that the so - called direct problem is well - posed , i.e. , the forward operator satisfies key regularity properties .",
    "this framework generalizes in a nontrivial way the structure used in previous works @xcite since it requires the introduction of more tools , in particular that of bochner spaces .",
    "secondly , in this setting , we develop a convergence analysis in a general context , based on convex regularization tools .",
