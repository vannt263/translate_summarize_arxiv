    "the numerical solution of the helmholtz equation by the finite element method or related schemes in the regime of large wave numbers is still among the most challenging tasks of computational partial differential equations .",
    "the highly oscillatory nature of the solution plus a wave number dependent pollution effect puts very restrictive assumptions on the smallness of the underlying mesh .",
    "typically , this condition is much stronger than the minimal requirement for a meaningful representation of highly oscillatory functions from approximation theory , that is , to have at least @xmath7 degrees of freedom per wave length and coordinate direction .",
    "the wave number dependent preasymptotic effect denoted as pollution or numerical dispersion is well understood by now and many attempts have been made to overcome or at least reduce it ; see @xcite among many others .",
    "however , for many standard methods , this is not possible in 2d or 3d @xcite .",
    "a breakthrough in this context is the work of melenk and sauter @xcite .",
    "it shows that for certain model helmholtz problems , the pollution effect can be suppressed in principle by simply coupling the polynomial degree @xmath8 of the galerkin finite element space to the wave number @xmath0 via the relation @xmath9 . under this moderate assumption ,",
    "the method is stable and quasi - optimal if the mesh size @xmath3 satisfies @xmath10 ( plus certain adaptive refinement towards non - smooth geometric features ) .",
    "it is worth noting that this result does not require the analyticity of the solution but only @xmath11-regularity and , thus , partially explains the common sense that higher - order methods are less sensitive to pollution .",
    "however , for less regular solutions as they appear for the scattering of waves from non - smooth objects or inhomogeneities of the material , the result is not directly applicable and the existence of a pollution - free discretization scheme remained open .",
    "scale - dependent preasymptotic effects are also observed in simpler diffusion problems with highly oscillatory diffusion tensor and numerical homogenization provides techniques to avoid those effects .",
    "numerical homogenization ( or upscaling ) refers to a class of multiscale methods for the efficient approximation on coarse meshes that do not resolve the coefficient oscillations .",
    "a novel method for this problem was recently introduced in @xcite and further generalized in @xcite .",
    "the method is based on localizable orthogonal decompositions ( lod ) into a low - dimensional coarse space ( where we are looking for the approximation ) and a high - dimensional remainder space .",
    "some selectable quasi - interpolation operator serves as the basis of the decompositions .",
    "the coarse space is spanned by some precomputable basis functions with local support .",
    "the method provides text book convergence independent of the variations of the coefficient and without any preasymptotic effects under fairly general assumptions on the diffusion coefficient ; periodicity or scale separation are not required .",
    "this paper adapts the multiscale method of @xcite to cure pollution in the numerical approximation of the helmholtz problem . to deal with the lack of hermitivity we will propose a petrov - galerkin version of the method ( although this is not essential ) . we will construct a finite - dimensional trial space and corresponding test space for the approximation of the unknown solution @xmath12 .",
    "the trial and test spaces are generated from standard mesh - based finite elements by local subscale correction .",
    "the precomputation of the correction involves the solution of @xmath13 coercive cell problems on localized subdomains of size @xmath2 ; @xmath3 being the mesh size and @xmath4 being the adjustable oversampling parameter .",
    "if the data of the problem ( domain , boundary condition , force term ) allows for polynomial - in-@xmath0 bounds of the solution operator and if the mesh size and the oversampling parameter of the method are such that the resolution condition @xmath14 and the oversampling condition @xmath15 are satisfied , then the method is stable .",
    "if , moreover , @xmath16 then the method satisfies the error estimate @xmath17 with some generic constant @xmath18 of @xmath0 . for a fairly large class of helmholtz problems , including the acoustic scattering from convex non - smooth objects , this result shows that pollution effects can be suppressed under the quasi - minimal resolution condition @xmath19 at the price of a moderate increase of the inter - element communication , i.e. , logarithmic - in-@xmath0 oversampling . using a terminology from finite difference methods",
    ", this means that the stencil is moderately enlarged .",
    "the complexity overhead due to oversampling is comparable with that of @xcite , where instead of increasing the inter - element communication , the number of degrees of freedom per element is increased via the polynomial degree which is coupled to @xmath20 in a similar way .",
    "while @xcite shows that pollution can not be avoided with a fixed stencil , the result shows that already a logarithmic - in-@xmath0 growths of the stencil can suffice to eliminate pollution .",
    "although the result is constructive , its practical relevance for actual computations is not immediately clear in any case .",
    "the multiscale method presented in this paper requires the precomputation of local cell problems on a finer scale of numerical resolution .",
    "the suitable choice of this fine scale depends on the stability properties of the problem in the same way as standard finite element methods do . however , the local cell problems are independent and , though being helmholtz problems , they are somewhat simpler because they are essentially low - frequency when compared to the characteristic length scale of the cell .",
    "still , the worst - case ( serial ) complexity of the method can exceed the cost of a direct numerical simulation on the global fine scale .",
    "we expect a significant gain with respect to computational complexity in the following cases :    * the precomputation can be reused several times , e.g. , if the problem ( with the same geometric setting and wave number ) has to be solved for a large number of force terms or incident wave directions in the context of parameter studies , coupled problems or inverse problems .",
    "* the ( local ) periodicity of the computational mesh can be exploited so that the number of local problems can be reduced drastically .",
    "we also expect that the redundancy of the local problems can be exploited in rather general unstructured meshes by modern techniques of model order reduction @xcite .",
    "however , this possibility requires a careful algorithmic design and error analysis which are beyond the scope of this paper and remain a future perspective of the method .",
    "a similar statement applies to the case of heterogeneous media .",
    "this application and the generalization of the method are very natural and straight forward . though this case",
    "is not yet covered , previous work @xcite plus the analysis of this paper strongly indicate the potential of the method to treat high oscillations or jumps in the pde coefficients and the pollution effect in one stroke .    the remaining part of the paper is outlined as follows .",
    "section  [ s : model ] defines the model helmholtz problem and recalls some of its fundamental properties .",
    "section  [ s : pre ] introduces standard finite element spaces and corresponding quasi - interpolation operators that will be the basis for the derivation of a prototypical multiscale method in section  [ s : omd ] .",
    "sections  [ s : loc ] and [ s : fine ] will then turn this ideal approach into a feasible method including a rigorous stability and error analysis .",
    "finally , section  [ s : numexp ] illustrate the performance of the method and one of its variants in numerical experiments .",

    "<S> we introduce a new petrov - galerkin multiscale method for the numerical approximation of the helmholtz equation with large wave number @xmath0 in bounded domains in @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the discrete trial and test spaces are generated from standard mesh - based finite elements by local subscale correction in the spirit of numerical homogenization . </S>",
    "<S> the precomputation of the correction involves the solution of coercive cell problems on localized subdomains of size @xmath2 ; @xmath3 being the mesh size and @xmath4 being the oversampling parameter . if the mesh size and the oversampling parameter are such that @xmath5 and @xmath6 fall below some generic constants and if the cell problems are solved sufficiently accurate on some finer scale of discretization , then the method is stable and its error is proportional to @xmath3 ; pollution effects are eliminated in this regime . </S>"
