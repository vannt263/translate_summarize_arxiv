    "in this work , we consider the quark and gluon parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in nuclei at small values of bjorken @xmath0 and their reduction as compared with the incoherent sum of the nucleon pdfs because of the phenomenon of nuclear shadowing .",
    "most of experimental information on nuclear pdfs comes from inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) with nuclear targets which measures the nuclear structure function @xmath2 . for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , which is called nuclear shadowing [",
    "@xmath5 is the isoscalar nucleon structure function and @xmath6 is the number of nucleons ] .",
    "because of the factorization theorem for dis ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which relates @xmath2 to nuclear parton distributions @xmath7",
    "( @xmath8 is the parton flavor ) , nuclear shadowing is also present in nuclear pdfs , @xmath9 for @xmath3 , where @xmath10 is the pdf of the free nucleon .",
    "this finds evidence in the results of the global fits that extract nuclear pdfs from various data on hard scattering with nuclei  @xcite .",
    "nuclear pdfs at small @xmath0 play an important role in the phenomenology of hard scattering with nuclei .",
    "their knowledge is required for the evaluation and interpretation of hard phenomena in proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , in real photon - nucleus interactions in ultraperipheral collisions at the lhc  @xcite , and in lepton - nucleus scattering at the future electron - ion collider ( eic )  @xcite .",
    "in addition , nuclear pdfs at small @xmath0 are needed for the quantitative estimation of the onset of saturation in ultra high energy interactions with nuclei , which can be studied at the lhc and the eic .",
    "a comparison of the results of the global fits for nuclear pdfs obtained by various groups  @xcite shows significant discrepancies in the predictions for nuclear pdfs at small @xmath0 ( uncertainties of individuals fits at small @xmath0 are also very large  @xcite ) .",
    "the main reason for this is that the global fits are predominantly based on fixed - target data that do not cover the small-@xmath0 region ( by requiring that @xmath11 gev@xmath12 is sufficient for the applicability of the factorization theorem , one limits @xmath13 ) .",
    "in addition , the gluon nuclear pdf is determined indirectly from the scaling violations using the very limited data .",
    "therefore , the extrapolation of the obtained nuclear pdfs to the low values of bjorken @xmath0 that will be probed at the lhc and the eic is essentially uncontrolled . an alternative to the global fits",
    "is provided by the approaches that attempt to predict nuclear shadowing for nuclear pdfs using the high - energy dynamics of the strong interactions .",
    "we use the so - called leading twist theory of nuclear shadowing  @xcite .",
    "it combines the technique used by gribov to derive nuclear shadowing for the total hadron - deuteron cross section at high energies  @xcite and the qcd factorization theorems for inclusive  @xcite and diffractive  @xcite dis .",
    "the numerical predictions employ the results of the leading twist qcd analyses of hard diffraction in lepton - proton dis at hera  @xcite .",
    "although in the leading twist approach the hard probe interacts with one parton of the nucleus , in the target rest frame , nuclear shadowing appears as the effect of multiple interactions of the projectile ( virtual photon ) with several ( all ) nucleons of the target .",
    "the interaction with @xmath14 nucleons is related in a model - independent way to the diffractive pdfs of the nucleon .",
    "the account of the interaction with @xmath15 nucleons is model - dependent and sensitive to the underlying dynamics of the hard diffraction .",
    "the recent hera data  @xcite revealed that the energy dependence of the hard diffraction in dis ( dependence on the light - cone fraction @xmath16 ) is close to that of the soft processes .",
    "this indicates that the hard diffraction in dis is dominated by large - size hadron - like configurations in the photon wave function .",
    "this observation allows us to improve the treatment of the contribution to nuclear shadowing coming from the interactions with @xmath17 nucleons as compared to the simplified quasi - eikonal approximation used in our earlier papers  @xcite by taking into account the presence of both point - like and hadron - like configurations in the virtual photon .",
    "the goal of the present letter is to present a new , improved treatment of such multiple interactions and to update predictions for nuclear shadowing in nuclear pdfs .",
    "we emphasize that the presence of the small - size ( point - like ) configurations and , in general , configurations of different transverse sizes that interact with different cross sections ( we call such configurations color or cross section fluctuations ) is much more important for the virtual photon than for hadronic projectiles .",
    "our letter is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lt_theory ] , we briefly review the leading twist theory of nuclear shadowing and present a new formalism for the treatment of the multiple interactions of the virtual photon with the nucleons of the nuclear target , which is based on the concept of color ( cross section ) fluctuations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cfa ] , we show that the complete treatment of color fluctuations can be well approximated by the so - called color fluctuation approximation . in sec .  [",
    "sec : predictions ] , we present updated predictions for the effect of nuclear shadowing in nuclear parton distributions .",
    "we focus on the predictions for heavy nuclei at small @xmath0 since modifications of the predictions for light nuclei ( where the @xmath14 term dominates ) are rather small .",
    "our results are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "the phenomenon of nuclear shadowing is fairly well - understood : in the target rest frame , nuclear shadowing arises as the result of multiple interactions of the projectile ( virtual photon ) with several nucleons of the nuclear target .",
    "the number of the interactions increases with decreasing bjorken @xmath0 , which is a result of the space - picture of the strong interactions , see e.g. , ref .  @xcite . at sufficiently high energies ( small bjorken @xmath0 )",
    ", the virtual photon can interact with all the nucleons of the target that are located in the photon s path .",
    "the graphs that contribute to the nuclear structure function @xmath2 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : master1 ] , where we used the optical theorem to relate the imaginary part of the @xmath18 forward scattering amplitude to the nuclear structure function . in the figure , graphs @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 correspond to the interaction with one , two , and three nucleons of the nuclear target , respectively .",

    "the calculation of the contribution of graph @xmath20 , @xmath24 , is fairly straightforward , but lengthy  @xcite .",
    "the detailed derivation , including the effect of the real part of the diffractive amplitude , is given in ref .",
    "here we present the final result for @xmath24 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the nucleon diffractive structure function measured in hard @xmath27 inclusive diffraction ; @xmath28 is the nuclear density ; @xmath29 is the ratio of the real to imaginary parts of the @xmath27 diffractive amplitude ; @xmath30 gev@xmath31 is the slope of the @xmath32 dependence of the diffractive @xmath33 cross section ; @xmath16 is the light - cone fraction of the nucleon momentum carried by the pomeron ( see the discussion below ) ; @xmath34 is the nucleon mass .    the nuclear density @xmath28 depends on the transverse coordinate ( impact parameter ) , @xmath35 , and the longitudinal coordinates , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , of the interacting nucleons .",

    "the derivation of the expressions for @xmath53 and @xmath54 is general and model - independent : the only simplifying approximations are the neglect of nucleon correlations in the nuclear wave function and of the @xmath32 dependence of the elementary diffractive @xmath55 amplitude .",

    "<S> the leading twist theory of nuclear shadowing predicts the shadowing correction to nuclear parton distributions at small @xmath0 by connecting it to the leading twist hard diffraction in electron - nucleon scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainties of the predictions are related to the shadowing effects resulting from the interaction of the hard probe with @xmath1 nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the pattern of hard diffraction observed at hera allows one to reduce these uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a new approach to the treatment of these multiple interactions , which is based on the concept of the color fluctuations and accounts for the presence of both point - like and hadron - like configurations in the virtual photon wave function . using the developed framework </S>",
    "<S> , we update our predictions for the leading twist nuclear shadowing in nuclear parton distributions of heavy nuclei at small @xmath0 . </S>"
