    "scattering amplitudes are physical observables that describe scattering processes of elementary particles .",
    "the standard perturbative expansion is based on the method of feynman diagrams . in last two decades",
    "there has been a huge progress on alternative approaches , driven by the idea that the amplitude should be fully determined by the on - shell data with no need to access the off - shell physics .",
    "this effort has lead to amazing discoveries that have uncover many surprising properties and dualities of amplitudes in gauge theories and gravity .",
    "one of the most important breakthroughs in this field was the discovery of the bcfw recursion relations @xcite that allow us to reconstruct the on - shell amplitudes recursively from most primitive amplitudes .",
    "they are applicable in many field theories , however , in some cases like effective field theories they can not be used .",
    "effective field theories play important role in theoretical physics .",
    "one particularly important example is the @xmath0 non - linear sigma model which describes the low - energy dynamics of the massless goldstone bosons corresponding to the chiral symmetry breaking @xmath1 . in the low energy qcd",
    "they are associated with the octet of pseudoscalar mesons and the model provides leading order predictions of interactions of pions and kaons that dominate hadronic world at lowest energies .",
    "it is also a starting point for many extensions or alternatives of electroweak standard model .    in this short note",
    "we find the recursion relations for all tree - level amplitudes of goldstone bosons in the @xmath0 non - linear sigma model .",
    "the importance of this result is two - fold : ( i ) it shows that the bcfw - like recursion relations can be applicable to much larger class of theories than expected before .",
    "this might also help to understand better properties of the theory invisible otherwise .",
    "it also tells us that the @xmath0 non - linear sigma model despite being an effective ( and therefore non - renormalizable ) field theory behaves in some cases similar to renormalizable theories .",
    "( ii ) it provides an effective tool for leading order ( tree - level ) calculations of amplitudes with many external pions which might be important for low energy particle phenomenology . more detailed description together with other results will be presented in @xcite .",
    "let us consider an @xmath2-pt on - shell scattering amplitude of massless particles , and denote @xmath3 the generators of the lie algebra of corresponding global symmetry group @xmath4 .",
    "if at tree - level each feynman diagram carries a single trace @xmath5 , we can decompose the full amplitude @xmath6 into sectors with the same group factor , @xmath7 where the sum is over all non - cyclic permutations .",
    "for each _ stripped _",
    "amplitude @xmath8 we have a natural ordering of momenta @xmath9 and a single term @xmath10 generates all the other by trivial relabeling . at the loop level we can define analogous object in the planar limit but in the general case this simple decomposition is not possible due to terms with multiple traces .    in 2004",
    "britto , cachazo , feng and witten ( bcfw ) @xcite found a recursive construction of tree - level on - shell amplitudes .",
    "the stripped amplitude @xmath11 is a gauge invariant object and one can try to fully reconstruct it from its poles . because of the ordering the only poles that can appear are of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 for some @xmath14,@xmath15 . on the pole the amplitude factorizes into two pieces , @xmath16{6pt}{0.65pt}}}}1})\\,.\\label{fact}\\ ] ]",

    "note that the shifted momenta remain on - shell and still satisfy momentum conservation .",
    "the original amplitude @xmath8 becomes a meromorphic function @xmath25 with only simple poles and if it vanishes for @xmath26 we can use cauchy theorem to reconstruct it , @xmath27 where @xmath28 are poles of @xmath25 , @xmath29 located in @xmath30 .",

    "according to ( [ fact ] ) @xmath34 is a product of two lower point amplitudes with shifted momenta and the cauchy theorem ( [ cauchy ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath35 where the sum is over all poles @xmath36 and @xmath37{6pt}{0.65pt}}}}1}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the physical case we set @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 in ( [ bcfw ] ) are lower point amplitudes , @xmath41 and therefore we can reconstruct @xmath25 recursively from simple on - shell amplitudes not using the off - shell physics at any step .",
    "bcfw recursion relations were originally found for yang - mills theory @xcite , and proven to work in gravity @xcite .",
    "there are many works showing validity in other theories ( e.g. for coupling to matter see @xcite ) .",
    "if the amplitude @xmath25 is constant or grows for large @xmath20 , the prescription ( [ cauchy ] ) can not be used directly .",
    "the constant behavior was studied e.g. in @xcite on the cases of @xmath42 and yukawa theory . in the generic situation of a power behavior @xmath43 for @xmath26",
    "we can use the following formula @xcite @xmath44 which reconstructs the amplitude in terms of its residues and its values at additional points @xmath45 different from @xmath28 .",
    "this is a generalization of formula first written in this context in @xcite and further discussed in @xcite where @xmath45 are chosen to be roots of @xmath25 .",
    "the other option is to use the all - line shift , i.e. deforming all external momenta .",
    "this was inspired by the work by risager @xcite and recently used for studying the on - shell constructibility of generic renormalizable theories in @xcite .",
    "this approach will be useful for our purpose .",
    "the lagrangian of the @xmath0 non - linear sigma model can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a constant and @xmath48 . in the most common exponential parametrization @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath3s are generators of @xmath0 lie algebra normalized according to @xmath51 .",
    "note that for @xmath52 , ( [ lagr ] ) is a leading @xmath53 term in the lagrangian for the chiral perturbation theory @xcite , which provides a systematic effective field theory description for low energy qcd with two massless quarks . in this case",
    "@xmath54 represent the pion triplet .    for calculations of on - shell scattering amplitudes within this model we use stripped amplitudes @xmath55 .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lagr ] ) contains only terms with the even number of @xmath56 , therefore @xmath57 and only @xmath58 are non - vanishing .",
    "it is easy to show that it makes no difference whether we use @xmath0 or @xmath59 symmetry group because the @xmath60 piece decouples @xcite . for our purpose",
    "it is convenient to use cayley parametrization of @xmath59 non - linear sigma model , @xmath61 plugging for @xmath62 into ( [ lagr ] ) we get an infinite tower of terms with two derivatives and an arbitrary number of @xmath56 .",
    "this is common for any parametrization , however , in this parametrization , the stripped feynman rule for the interaction vertex is particularly simple , @xmath63 it is easy to see that the shifted amplitudes @xmath64 for @xmath26 . without additional information on the values at two points @xmath45 the relation ( [ subtr ] ) can not be used .",
    "therefore , we will follow different strategy to determine @xmath25 recursively .",
    "let us define a semi - on - shell current @xmath65 as a matrix element of the field @xmath66 between vacuum and the @xmath2-particle state @xmath67 .",
    "the momentum @xmath68 attached to @xmath66 is off - shell satisfying @xmath69 . at the tree - level",
    "the current can be written as a sum of stripped currents @xmath70 as @xmath71 the on - shell amplitude @xmath72 can be extracted from @xmath73 by means of the lsz formulas @xmath74 the one particle states are normalized according to @xmath75 .",

    "the current @xmath84 is obviously a homogeneous function of momenta of degree 0 .",
    "it is not cyclic because there is a special off - shell momentum @xmath68 .",
    "note , however , @xmath84 is unphysical object and can be different in different parametrizations . from now on we will use only cayley parametrization where it has interesting properties under the re - scaling of all even or all odd on - shell momenta .",
    "namely for @xmath85 : @xmath86 we postpone the detailed discussion to @xcite .",
    "the proof is by induction using berends - giele recursion relations @xcite which are more suitable for this purpose than the analysis of feynman diagrams used to show scaling properties of yang - mills theory and gravity in @xcite .",
    "the scaling properties ( [ scaleodd ] ) and ( [ scaleeven ] ) are our guide for finding recursion relations for @xmath87 .",
    "let us define the complex deformation of the current @xmath88 : @xmath89 i.e. the momenta are shifted according to @xmath90 note that the momentum conservation is hold because the off - shell momentum @xmath91 becomes also shifted .",
    "in the limit @xmath92 using ( [ scaleeven ] ) we get @xmath93 on the other hand for @xmath26 we get as a consequence of homogeneity and ( [ scaleodd ] ) the current @xmath88 vanishes like @xmath94 and we can use the standard bcfw recursion relations to reconstruct it from its poles .",
    "the singularities of the physical current @xmath95 are determined by condition @xmath96 which implies the following condition for the poles of @xmath88 @xmath97 where @xmath98 is even and we have decomposed @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 is the sum of even and odd momenta respectively between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath102 for @xmath103 we find two solutions of ( [ polesz ] ) , namely @xmath104 for the special case of three - particle pole , @xmath105 , either @xmath106 or @xmath107 . for the first case @xmath108 and the corresponding residue",

    "contains a current @xmath87 on the right hand side and therefore we can not express it using lower point currents .",
    "the solution to this problem is to use two extra relations .",
    "the first is the residue theorem : because of the asymptotic behavior ( [ largez ] ) the residue at infinity vanishes and the sum of all residues is zero , @xmath128 while the second one is the scaling property ( [ zeroz ] ) for @xmath92 together with ( [ recursion ] ) @xmath129 denoting @xmath130 and solving for @xmath131 from ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) in terms of all other residues we can rewrite ( [ recursion ] ) in the form @xmath132\\,,\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum is over all solutions of ( [ polesz ] ) with the exception of @xmath133 .",

    ": we construct the amplitude recursively from the 4pt formula via bcfw while ( [ berends ] ) uses critically the lagrangian and the infinite tower of terms in the expansion of ( [ lagr ] ) .",
    "we found the recursion relations for on - shell scattering amplitudes of goldstone bosons in the @xmath0 non - linear sigma model .",
    "we defined a semi - on - shell current @xmath84 and used the berends - giele recursion relations to prove its special scaling properties .",
    "this allowed us to apply a particular all - line shift together with bcfw construction to find the current recursively from the simplest three - point case .",
    "the on - shell amplitude was then obtained from a trivial limit when the off - shell momentum in @xmath84 became on - shell .",
    "the existence of such recursion relations for effective theory gives an evidence that on - shell methods can be used for much larger classes of theories than has been considered so far .",
    "it also shows that this theory is very special and deeper understanding of all its properties is still missing . for future directions",
    ", it would be interesting to see if the construction can be re - formulated purely in terms of on - shell scattering amplitudes not using the semi - on - shell current .",
    "next possibility is to focus on loop amplitudes .",
