    "we show that a simple , yet previously overlooked , mechanism may give rise to a substantial velocity dispersion in the proton component of gamma - ray burst fireballs .",
    "namely , in grb fireballs in which neutron decoupling occurs , large center of mass energy collisions between decoupled neutrons and protons will induce a velocity dispersion in the proton component . for certain fireball parameters",
    "the timescale for re - thermalization of these protons is longer than the dynamical timescale , and so the protons will retain their acquired dispersion .",
    "this has consequences for the dynamics of the fireball . since the ultra - relativistic proton shell",
    "is directly tied to gamma - ray photon production @xcite , the distribution of proton energy can affect the dynamics of photon emission .",
    "in the internal shock grb model the @xmath0-ray photons are produced through internal multiple - shock collisions involving the protons .",
    "the efficiency for the conversion of shock kinetic energy to photon energy increases with increasing relative shock velocities @xcite .",
    "in addition , the energetic proton shock produces particle cascades leading to multi - tev neutrino emission @xcite .",
    "therefore , both photon and neutrino radiation may be affected by the process discussed here .",
    "more basically , the process we discuss here represents a new aspect of our understanding of the evolution of homogeneous relativistic fireballs .",
    "the standard picture holds that a thermal plasma undergoes an initial acceleration phase , lasting until the energy in relativistic particles is transferred to the kinetic energy of protons , or , in the case of extremely baryon - dilute plasmas , until the plasma becomes optically thin to photons @xcite .",
    "following the acceleration phase a coasting phase ensues . in the coasting phase",
    "the baryons are assumed thermal with typically low temperatures , @xmath1 , in the plasma rest frame .",
    "recently it has been recognized that in fireballs satisfying certain initial conditions the neutrons will dynamically decouple @xcite from the expanding @xmath2/photon / proton plasma .",
    "there is an interesting connection between this decoupling and the net number of electrons per baryon , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the electron fraction , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the number densities of positrons and electrons respectively , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the number densities of neutrons and protons .",
    "the connection is that when conditions near the fireball source lead to a low @xmath4 in the outflow , substantial differences between the final neutron and proton lorentz factors are possible @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate a second connection : when the electron fraction in the fireball is low , high energy collisions between decoupled neutrons and protons induce a velocity dispersion in the protons and that these `` hot protons '' are not re - thermalized .",
    "the sensitivity of this effect to @xmath4 in the fireball is interesting because , in analogy to type ii supernovae , the electron fraction may mirror weak physics in the central engine @xcite .",
    "the essential features of the physics of baryon flow in relativistic fireballs are obtained by considering a two component [ ( i ) @xmath9/photon / proton and ( ii ) neutron ] homogeneous fireball with initial radius , temperature , and electron fraction @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively . in terms of these quantities the entropy per baryon in units of @xmath12 is @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the ratio of total energy to rest mass in the fireball .",
    "a central issue for grbs is the `` baryon loading problem '' , the statement that @xmath15 must be large in order to get the fireball moving with a high lorentz factor .    for relativistic fireballs ( @xmath16 a few ) , numerical and analytic work show that to first approximation the fireball evolves as @xcite @xmath17 here @xmath0 is the lorentz factor of the fireball .",
    "these relations follow from entropy and energy conservation and are violated at the beginning and end of the fireball s evolution ( see below ) . in terms of the time @xmath18 as measured by an observer comoving with the plasma , the lorentz factor and temperature evolve as @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 characterizes the fireball source size .",

    ") observations of time variability in grbs give the constraint @xmath21 , while the smallest proposed grb sources are solar mass scale compact objects with @xmath22 .",
    "particles in the plasma suffer a 4-acceleration with magnitude gamma @xmath23 .",
    "neutrons have such a small magnetic dipole moment that they are essentially only coupled to the accelerating plasma via strong scatterings with protons ( near the decoupling point @xmath24 ) where @xmath25 is the thomson cross section . to an excellent approximation ,",
    "then , the neutron - proton collision timescale in terms of the comoving proton number density @xmath26 in the plasma rest frame is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the relative neutron proton velocity .",
    "apart from small corrections stemming from inelastic nucleon - nucleon scatterings , entropy is conserved throughout the acceleration of the fireball .",
    "this implies @xmath29 except for the brief period when the electron / positron pairs annihilate and transfer their entropy to the photons .",

    "it is difficult to analytically estimate @xmath44 , but as most inelastic nucleon - nucleon collisions occur near the decoupling point , it is presumably of order @xmath46 . in the numerical examples we present below",
    ", neutrino energy loss is estimated and is found to be small enough so as not to alter the qualitative picture presented here .",
    "subsequent to neutron decoupling , protons will undergo collisions with decoupled neutrons .",
    "the first requirement for the presence of a `` hot '' proton component is that some of these collisions are high energy collisions .",
    "if in the lab frame a proton and neutron have lorentz factors @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively , then the @xmath0 of the neutron as seen by the proton is @xmath49 a high energy neutron - proton collision implies then : @xmath50 this condition is intendend only as a rough guide for the fireball parameters needed to drive the proton component hot .    for reasonable fireball parameters",
    "it is difficult to attain substantial @xmath51 unless @xmath52 .",
    "it has been argued that a low electron fraction will naturally be obtained in many of the proposed grb environments @xcite .",
    "in addition , in calculations of grbs arising from neutron star mergers @xmath53 has been estimated @xcite .",
    "it is not clear if such low electron fractions are also obtained , for example , in the collapsar model for grb central engines @xcite .",
    "protons undergoing collisions with neutrons will lose energy to the background photons and electrons . whether or not these protons re - thermalize with the plasma depends on their thermalization timescale @xmath54 .",
    "the protons will remain `` cool '' ( _ i.e. , _ well coupled and thermal ) if @xmath55 , where the last inequality holds near and after decoupling .",
    "if the opposite case holds , @xmath56 , the protons could keep the velocity dispersion they acquire through collisions with neutrons ( _ i.e. _ become `` hot '' ) .",
    "there are two energy loss mechanisms for protons with a velocity relative to the background plasma .",
    "the first is proton - electron scattering .",

    "the relations derived above imply that decoupling occurs at a temperature @xmath61 , with @xmath62 .",
    "this clearly implies that decoupling occurs after @xmath2 annihilation . noting that the ionization electron number density is @xmath63 , and noting that typical kinetic energies of protons relative to the plasma are of the order of a few gev , we see that the thermalization timescale via proton / electron scattering is @xmath64    ref .",
    "@xcite made the observation that a pion - induced electromagnetic cascade may lead to an increase in the number density of electrons and positrons in the fireball .",
    "the greatest this increase could be occurs when all of the pion mass ( minus neutrino losses ) goes into @xmath65 pairs and when , in addition , the processes creating @xmath65 pairs are sufficiently rapid that they come into equilibrium with electron / positron pair annihilation .    by considering this limiting case",
    ", one finds that a pion - induced electromagnetic cascade can delay the onset of a dispersion in the proton component ( _ i.e. _ make @xmath66 ) only for very small electron fractions , @xmath67 .",
    "( the number 4 appearing in parentheses here arises from requiring that a large center of mass energy collision is needed to drive a proton dispersion and is explained in more detail below ) .",
    "therefore , a pion induced electromagnetic cascade has little or no leverage in delaying the development of a dispersion in the protons for moderate electron fractions .",
    "the second energy loss mechanism for protons arises because , when the protons acquire a dispersion , the electrons must rearrange themselves in order to preserve charge neutrality .",
    "this rearrangement , on its own , has a negligible effect on the proton dispersion because of the smallness of the ratio of the electron to proton mass .",
    "however , compton scattering following this rearrangement can be a source of energy loss for the protons .",
    "in other words , runaway protons may be viewed as being tightly paired with electrons via the coulomb force , and the proton loses energy not only at the rate given in eq .",
    "[ tautherm1 ] , but in addition at the rate at which the electron to which it is coupled loses energy to the background photons via thomson / compton drag :    @xmath68    with @xmath69 the photon energy density , giving , @xmath70 the total thermalization timescale is given by @xmath71    a hot proton component arises , then , if neutron decoupling occurs , and at the end of the fireball s acceleration phase @xmath72 .",
    "applying the simple picture given above for the evolution of the fireball gives the second condition for a hot proton component : @xmath73    in fact , the fireball is still accelerating for fireball radius values greater than @xmath74 ( @xcite , and see below ) .",
    "this implies that the temperature during the acceleration phase becomes lower than @xmath75 and , hence , that the condition for the development of a hot proton component is somewhat weaker than that given above .    in fig .",
    "1 we illustrate the decrease in degree of thermalization with increasing initial @xmath76 for a proton moving relative to a background plasma and losing energy via the the processes described in eqs .",
    "[ tautherm1 ] and [ tautherm2 ] .",
    "( i.e. to different plasma temperatures ) at @xmath77 cm .",
    "the different values of @xmath78 are given next to the curves.,width=288 ]      in addition to the requirement of charge neutrality leading to proton energy loss via electron compton scattering , there are other collisionless processes that may affect the dynamics of the protons .",
    "indeed , the proton and electron plasma frequencies are comparable to or larger than the collision frequencies after decoupling , @xmath79 with @xmath80 and @xmath81 the proton and electron plasma frequencies .",
    "the post decoupling proton dispersed fireball may provide fertile and novel ground for the study of plasma instabilities .",
    "in particular , the protons may be subject to an analog of the two - stream instability because of collisionally produced bumps in the proton distribution function at the bulk plasma and near the mean neutron component velocities .",
    "the plasma may also be subject to velocity space anisotropy - driven electromagnetic instabilities as the transverse velocity freezes out during the expansion of the fireball .",
    "relevant for the present work , it has been shown that magnetic trapping can saturate these instabilities at substantial ion anisotropies @xcite , and that they are moderately stabilized by relativistic effects @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of the saturation level of the proton anisotropy in this system would be interesting because lower saturation levels imply less dispersion reduction due to adiabatic cooling of the tranverse momenta . in the presence of a magnetic field , either generated by the central engine or created through instabilities , other instabilities , involving ,",
    "for example , ion - cyclotron waves , may operate .",
    "instabilities may play an important role in the setting of the proton distribution function .",
    "they are not expected to alter our result of a dispersion in the proton component , because for the closely related system of counter - streaming ion beams they are well studied and a substantial reduction in an initial dispersion is not seen @xcite .",
    "these instabilities have also been studied in the regime where collisions are important , and in this case counter - streaming ion beams take , as expected , a few collision timescales to slow @xcite .",
    "however , studies of the coupling between plasma instabilities and the hydrodynamic evolution of the protons in the peculiar high photon entropy / small dynamic timescale environment characteristic of grb fireballs have apparently not been done , and may give interesting and unexpected results .",
    "the fact that plasma instabilities play a role during the acceleration phase of some relativistic fireballs is quite interesting , because the previous picture was that collisional processes are sufficient to describe the early evolution in the absence of central engine - generated magnetic fields .    a diagram illustrating the various influences on the proton distribution function , including the trend toward a smoother distribution function resulting from plasma instabilities , is shown in fig .",

    "we find @xmath87 and @xmath88 implying a dispersion in the proton component of @xmath89 .",

    "the dot dashed line is for case ( i ) , where baryons are assumed coupled to the plasma ; the dashed line is for case ( ii ) , where neutron velocities are described by a velocity distribution function and where neutrons are allowed to decouple while protons are assumed frozen into the plasma ; and the solid line is for case ( iii ) , where neutrons and protons are both allowed to decouple . note the change in scale between the upper and lower figures.,width=288 ]    to illustrate the effects discussed here we present results for the case where ( i ) protons and neutrons are assumed coupled to and thermalized with the plasma ; ( ii ) a distribution function is used to describe the neutrons but the protons are assumed coupled to and thermalized with the @xmath97photon plasma ( the agreement between the final proton lorentz factors in this case and the simple estimate given by eq .",

    "perhaps the most striking feature of this calculation is the increase in lorentz factor of the highest energy protons as the protons acquire a dispersion . because energy conservation implies that the mean lorentz factor of the protons is unchanged between cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) ( modulo changes in the net energy carried by the neutrons and pions due to the protons acquiring a velocity dispersion ) the difference in final lorentz factors between cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) provides a measure of the proton dispersion .",
