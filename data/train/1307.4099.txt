    "they found that a companion star with a mass above 3.5 m@xmath13 could be ruled out including luminous red giants and almost all helium stars .    in all non - merging scenarios",
    "a wind from the companion star would be expected .",
    "the density of this wind depends on the geometry of the mass transfer , as well as of the mass loss rate of the companion and the wind speed .",
    "if the wind is ionized and dense enough , it could reveal itself in the form of narrow emission lines before being overtaken by the supernova blast wave , just as in narrow - line core - collapse supernovae , sne  iin .",
    "if hydrogen dominates the wind , h@xmath8 would be emitted ( e.g. , cumming et al .",

    "the mass lost from the companion could in that case be close to neutral .",
    "patat et al . (",

    "chugai ( 2008 ) has reanalyzed the data for sn 2006x and concludes that the spectral features patat et al .",
    "see may not be circumstellar but rather a geometrical effect .",
    "the latter could be supported by the likely absence ( crotts & yourdon 2008 ) rather than presence ( wang et al .",
    "2008 ) of circumstellar dust around sn 2006x , as well as absence of radio emission two years after the explosion ( chandra et al .",

    "although , the fraction of sne  ia showing a prominent csm interaction is pretty low , @xmath120.1 - 1% ( dilday et al .",

    "an alternative to nova - like shells ( dilday et al .",
    "2012 ) is that the csm structure is formed by a merger of a white dwarf with the core of a massive asymptotic giant branch companion , ending their common envelope phase and ejecting multiple shells ( soker et al .",

    "2012 ) implies an extremely low mass loss rate from the progenitor system of sn  2011fe . while there are indeed single degenerate scenarios where very low csm densities are expected ( e.g. , di stefano et al . 2011 , justham 2011 ) , a possible problem for the single degenerate explanation for sn  2011fe is the lack of signatures from a companion ( shappee et al .",
    "2013a ) .    some recent sne",

    "see also the comprehensive study by tanaka et al .",
    "we summarize our results and discussions for both early and late phases in sect .",
    "to obtain an upper limit on the density of the putative circumstellar gas around sn 2000cx and other sne  ia , we have modeled the line emission in a way similar to c96 and lc97 , although with some important refinements .",
    "we assume that the supernova ejecta have a density profile of @xmath36 ( like in the w7 model of nomoto et al . 1984 ) , and that the ejecta interact with the wind of a binary companion which has a density profile of @xmath37 . very early , i.e. , during the first few hours after explosion , the radius of the outermost supernova ejecta is comparable to the presumed binary separation , and the ejecta expand into an asymmetric environment .",
    "but already after @xmath19 day the interaction between the ejecta and the wind occurs sufficiently far away from the center of explosion and the center of wind emission to justify that the interaction can be treated as point - symmetric . for simplicity , we will assume a spherically symmetric situation .",
    "the assumption of power - law density distributions for the ejecta and the wind makes it possible to use similarity solutions for the expansion and structure of the interaction region ( chevalier 1982a ) .",
    "this is obviously a simplification since the wind structure close to the white dwarf is uncertain , and the density profile of the outer ejecta may be quite different from @xmath36 early on ( e.g. , branch et al .",
    "1985 ) , possibly closer to an exponential fall - off ( dwarkadas & chevalier 1998 ) .",
    "ideally , one should therefore model the interaction of the ejecta with the circumstellar gas numerically rather than using similarity solutions .",
    "however , considering that we are only interested in the evolution after @xmath19 day , when the inner region of the wind has been overtaken , and part of the outer ejecta has been shocked , we have followed the method of c96 to use similarity solutions to describe the expansion and structure of the interaction region .",
    "we start our calculations at @xmath38  day after explosion , and at this epoch we assume that the maximum velocity of the ejecta is @xmath39 .",
    "this is higher than in c96 , but corresponds better to the fastest ejecta in explosion models ( see , e.g. , branch et al .",
    "1985 ) , as well as the highest velocity seen in ca  ii for sne  1984a , 1990n , 2001el ( m05 ) and sn  2003du ( stanishev et al . , 2007 )",
    "about 10 days before maximum , @xmath40 ( see also sect .",
    "3.3 and the compilation of high - velocity features in sn  ia by mazzali et al .",
    "note the difference in time zero in our models , and in general for supernova light curves which normally refers to @xmath29-band maximum which occurs @xmath41 days after the explosion . with the adopted slopes of the ejecta and the circumstellar gas , the fall - off of the maximum ejecta velocity conforms to @xmath42 , according to the similarity solutions of chevalier ( 1982a ) . at 1 day ,",
    "the velocities of the circumstellar shock and the reverse shock going into the ejecta are @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the ionizing radiation from the interaction region is composed of free - free emission from the shocked ejecta and circumstellar gas , and comptonized photospheric radiation in the shocked gas .",
    "the situation is thus similar to that discussed by fransson ( 1984 ) and lundqvist & fransson ( 1988 ) for sne  1979c and 1980k , and by fransson et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for sn  1993j .",
    "the main difference is that the expected wind density for sn  ia progenitors is lower than for these core - collapse sne , which all had wind densities in excess of @xmath45 ( lundqvist & fransson 1988 ; fransson & bjrnsson 1998 ) . here",
    ", @xmath46 is the wind velocity in units of @xmath47 .",
    "it is also likely that the structure of the outer ejecta in core - collapse sne have steeper density profiles than sne  ia , and therefore a slower deceleration of the shocks and a different structure of the shocked gas ( chevalier 1982a ) .",
    "the result is a higher expected temperature of the reverse shock in sn  ia , which in combination with the lower wind density means that the reverse shock will not be radiative for sne  ia in our scenario even for the highest mass loss rates in our grid ( @xmath45 ) already at @xmath19 day ; the closest we get is @xmath48 . because @xmath49 in our model ( cf .",
    "fransson et al . 1996 ) no cool shell of shocked ejecta will form .",
    "if inverse compton scattering in the shocked ejecta is important for the highest wind densities ( see below ) , a cool shell could form early on .",
    "we note that gerardy et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in their models for sn  2003du assumed that the supernova may encounter very dense circumstellar material immediately after the explosion , and that the density of the circumstellar gas could be high enough for the forward and reverse shocks to become radiative .",
    "however , as they do not quantify possible emission of ionizing radiation and how it could affect unshocked circumstellar gas further away from the supernova , we can not compare the results . in our scenario , the radiation from the reverse shock will reach the circumstellar gas unattenuated , making the reverse shock emission more important for the ionization of the wind at energies below @xmath22  kev than the free - free radiation from the circumstellar shock ( see below ) , and we have omitted the latter in our models .",
    "cumming et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and lc97 assumed a constant density and temperature of the shocked gas . we instead take the density and temperature structures of the reverse shock from similarity solutions ( chevalier 1982a ) , and use these to calculate the free - free emission from the shocked gas . as in c96",
    "we note that the shocked ejecta are likely to be composed of c and o rather than h and he , which gives a higher temperature .",
    "for equal number densities of c and o , @xmath50 , the temperature increase is a factor @xmath51 compared to solar abundances . with the parameters chosen in our models , the temperature of the reverse shock evolves as @xmath52  k , where @xmath53 is the time in days since the explosion .",
    "the heavier elements also boost the free - free emissivity , @xmath54 , for a given temperature .",
    "the combined effect of temperature increase and boost in @xmath54 compared to a wind of solar abundance can be exemplified by a case with @xmath50 and @xmath55  k ( valid just behind the shock front at @xmath56  days , i.e. , somewhat later than the observed epoch of sn 1992a , see below ) .",
    "the corresponding temperature for the solar abundance composition would be @xmath57  k. taking the temperature difference into account , @xmath58 is a factor of @xmath59 higher for the metal - rich ejecta .",
    "this obviously affects the derived value for the mass loss rate from x - ray observations ( see below ) .    as in c96 and lc97",
    "we take the finite time scale of electron - ion equilibration in the shocked gas into account .",
    "we have simulated this by calculating models where the electron temperature , @xmath60 , is a factor of 2 lower than @xmath61 .",
    "unequal electron and ion temperatures are more likely in our current models than in the models in c96 since we now use a higher , and more realistic , shock velocity . assuming pure coulomb collisions and @xmath62 ( cf . above ) , electron - ion equilibration in the shocked ejecta occurs for a wind described by a mass loss rate of @xmath63 . poorly known plasma instabilities may give electron - ion equilibration also for lower mass loss rates , and we have therefore calculated models with @xmath64 ( @xmath65 being the ion temperature ) also for low mass loss rates .",
    "in c96 and lc97 it was assumed that the reverse shock was the sole source of ionizing radiation ( apart from a weak preionization by the white dwarf ) .",
    "it was argued that the shock breakout and subsequent photospheric emission were inefficient in ionizing the wind .",
    "however , model calculations by blinnikov & sorokina ( 2000 ) show that there may be a phase of ionizing radiation from the photosphere for a few days within the first @xmath22 days after the explosion .",
    "in some of our models we have therefore included the results of blinnikov & sorokina ( 2001 ) , and in particular their w7jzl155.ph model , which is an updated version of the w7jz.ph model in blinnikov & sorokina ( 2000 ) .",
    "these models use the w7 model of nomoto et al .",
    "( 1984 ) as input , and have a peak in far - uv emission between days @xmath66 .",
    "for the original models ( blinnikov & sorokina 2000 ) we found that the photospheric emission was strong and actually dominates the ionization of the wind after @xmath67 days in our models . including an updated uv line list ,",
    "the models of blinnikov & sorokina ( 2001 ) predict less far - uv emission so that it becomes less important for the ionization of the wind . still , the emission from the photosphere is important for models with low wind densities .",
    "for example , the luminosity of ionizing photons emitted from the photosphere in the w7jzl155.ph model at 5  days is @xmath68  s@xmath21 , whereas the luminosity of ionizing photons at the same epoch from the reverse shock for a model with @xmath69 and @xmath64 is @xmath70  s@xmath21 .",
    "it is obvious that the photospheric emission has to be modeled in even greater detail to investigate its far - uv emission as it could be important for the ionization of the surrounding medium , in particular if the circumstellar gas would reside far out from the explosion site as in the shell model for sn  2006x proposed by patat et al .",
    "( 2007b ) .",
    "in such a case the photospheric emission would be the sole ionizing source .    in the models of blinnikov & sorokina the photospheric spectrum falls steeply with photon energy above the ionization threshold of hydrogen , and is unimportant at x - ray energies .",
    "the photons emitted from the photosphere will , however , be boosted in energy by interaction with the hot electrons in the shocked ejecta and circumstellar gas .",
    "the shocked circumstellar gas is unlikely to have equal ion and electron temperatures , but it seems reasonable to assume that the electron temperature can attain a temperature of order @xmath71 k , just as indicated for sn  1993j ( fransson et al .",
    "1996 ) , especially for models in the upper range of the values for @xmath72 we have considered . as long as this is true , the free - free emission from the circumstellar shock is unimportant for the ionization radiation compared to that from the reverse shock ( because of the , in our scenario , @xmath73 larger mass of shocked ejecta compared to shocked circumstellar gas as well as @xmath74 times higher density ) , but for our assumed ejecta velocity and density structures of the wind and ejecta , the optical depth to electron scattering in the shocked circumstellar gas is @xmath75 , and this may create an important power - law tail to the photospheric spectrum ( cf .",
    "fransson et al . 1996 ) , especially at early times . here",
    "@xmath76 is the mass loss rate of the wind in units of @xmath77 . for lower values of @xmath72 coulomb heating may not be enough to heat the shocked wind up to @xmath71 k which will reduce the importance of inverse compton scattering rapidly .",
    "the free - free emission from the shocked circumstellar gas could in such cases instead become more important as it would increase in strength at energies below @xmath19 kev . early on , inverse compton scattering of the shocked ejecta may also be important , i.e. , when the shocked ejecta are heated up to @xmath78 k. however , already at 10 days , the shocked ejecta temperature has fallen below @xmath71 k , and the electron temperature may be even lower ( cf . above ) .",
    "considering the uncertainty of the temperature of the forward shock , we have omitted the ionizing radiation from the circumstellar shock .",

    "we have chosen this epoch since it corresponds to the epoch of observation for sn  1992a ( schlegel & petre 1993 ) . because the spectrum is dominated by free - free emission , the emitted spectrum has the dependence @xmath89 . at energies below @xmath67  kev absorption in the circumstellar gas becomes important , but the @xmath90 dependence holds also for the observed flux down to roughly half a kev at this epoch . in fig .  1 we have included the observed upper limit derived for sn  1992a ( schlegel & petre 1993 ) .",

    "this is substantially higher than derived by schlegel & petre ( 1993 ) who obtained @xmath92 .",
    "a reason for the discrepancy between our result and that of schlegel & petre , except for our updated estimate of the x - ray spectrum , is that schlegel & petre used the time since supernova maximum , instead of the time since explosion in their luminosity estimate .",
    "their limit is therefore clearly too low if the reverse shock dominates the ionizing radiation .",
    "a point of caution here is that inverse compton scattering could be important if the electrons of the shocked circumstellar gas are hot enough . for @xmath93 , the optical depth in the shocked circumstellar gas @xmath94 .",
    "depending on the electron temperature , this may be enough to affect our estimated upper limit of @xmath95 for sn 1992a . including only the free - free emission from the reverse shock",
    "thus gives a conservative limit .",
    "the model presented here for the ionizing radiation from the reverse shock was also included in the analysis of the x - ray observations of the normal sn  ia  2002bo by hughes et al . ( 2007 ) , along with modeling only assuming coulomb heating of the electrons in the shocked gas .",
    "the observed upper limit to the x - ray emission from sn  2002bo was found to correspond to @xmath96 , i.e. , slightly higher than our limit for sn  1992a .",
    "the ionizing radiation produced by the shocked gas ionizes and heats the unshocked circumstellar gas .",
    "we have used an updated version of our time dependent photoionization code described in lundqvist & fransson ( 1996 ) , to calculate the temperature and ionization structure of this gas . as in c96",

    "we only considered models with @xmath64 for the reverse shock .    assuming that free - free emission from the reverse shock dominates the ionization of the circumstellar gas , the ionized part of the wind will be confined to a volume set by the shock radius , @xmath102 , and an outer  strmgren \" radius , @xmath103 , which is only a few times larger than @xmath102",
    "the situation looks like that depicted in fig . 1 of lundqvist & fransson ( 1988 ) .",

    "the ionized region is slightly larger for models with the softer spectrum in @xmath112 models compared to model with @xmath64 .",
    "the reason is that a slightly larger number of ionizing photons at lower energies are produced in the @xmath112 models .",
    "these photons are also more easily absorbed by the circumstellar gas as x - ray cross sections of ions decrease with photon energy .",
    "the main difference between models with different values of @xmath95 is that @xmath113 increases with increasing @xmath95 .",
    "for example , at 10 days @xmath114 for @xmath115 and @xmath64 .     as a function of time from the explosion .",

    "figure 2 shows the evolution of the wind temperature , weighted with the h@xmath8 luminosity .",
    "as one can see , this temperature remains within @xmath118 k for all our @xmath64 models .",
    "we use this finding below when estimating the wind density around sn  2000cx .",

    "the reason is the higher x - ray cross section of the metals compared to hydrogen .",
    "allowing for a photospheric contribution to the ionization of the circumstellar gas , the situation could change significantly .",
    "the main change is that photospheric emission is independent of the wind density , and that models with low values of @xmath95 become significantly more ionized .",

    "any changes in these velocities with time ( up to + 7 days ) are difficult to disentangle from the data presented in thomas et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , although there may be a hint that at least the ir feature may recede marginally .",
    "thomas et al . ( 2004 ) modelled the hv features assuming both spherical and nonspherical distributions of the absorbing material .",
    "their best fit was obtained assuming both spherical symmetry and an elongated feature along the line of sight with a maximum optical depth at @xmath210 ( cf .",
    "their fig .  9 ) .",
    "interestingly enough , leonard et al .",
    "( 2000 ) reported continuum polarization of @xmath211 for this supernova at + 2 days , which could in fact signal an aspherical scattering surface .",
    "we have used our data to extend the study of hv ca  ii absorption in sn 2000cx to @xmath212 days . as for our data of sn 2001el presented in m05",
    "we decided to normalize the continuum by a first order polynomial fit around the profile of interest to better trace the line wings .",
    "the normalized spectra are shown in fig .",
    "14 where the solid line is for the ir triplet , and the dashed line for the h&k lines .",
    "the velocities are with respect to the bluest components of the multiplets as discussed for the data of thomas et al .",
    "( 2004 ) above .    for the h&k lines we find that the ca  ii absorption reaches out to @xmath213 , and for ir lines at least out to @xmath214 .",
    "there is also an absorption feature in the ir lines reaching @xmath215 which , however , does not appear to be present in the h&k lines .",
    "furthermore , it can be expected that the h&k lines have a higher optical depth ( e.g. , mihalas 1978 ) and are present at a higher velocity than the ir lines as they originate from a lower level of the ca  ii ion and have larger oscillator strengths .",
    "in fact , the hv h&k lines have been observed to show wings extending to much higher velocities than the ir lines at least in sne 1990n and 2001el ( for details see m05 ) .",
    "however , this behavior could also be due to the h&k profile blending with other lines ( e.g. , kasen et al .",
    "2003 ) , and therefore a full nlte analysis would be needed to be conclusive for sn 2000cx . also , the ca  ii line absorption shown by sn 2000cx is much weaker than the one seen in sne  1990n and 2001el , making an estimate of the maximum velocity less accurate .",
    "in contrast to the behavior shown by , e.g. , sn 2001el ( m05 ) , it appears that in sn 2000cx the maximum ca  ii velocities at @xmath212 days are similar to the maximum velocites at @xmath216 days . in general , a decreasing maximum velocity of the ca  ii absorption would be expected simply because the column density of the ejecta decreases with time as @xmath217 , and disregarding abundance and ionization effects , the most dilute gas will become optically thin faster . for the outer ejecta",
    ", the density falls off quickly with radius ( cf .",
    "3.1 ) so a receding blue edge of the ir triplet could fit into a picture where the outermost ejecta become progressively optically thinner in ca  ii . the constant maximum ca  ii velocity of sn 2000cx could indicate that the structure of the absorbing gas is more shell - like than in sn 2001el , although we reiterate that conclusions from the weaker absorption in sn 2000cx must be drawn with caution .",
    "in section 3.1.2 we derived upper limits for the h@xmath8 line fluxes ( see table 2 ) . adopting an extinction of @xmath191=0.08 and a distance of 33 mpc for sn2000cx",
    ", these flux limits correspond to line luminosities of @xmath218 = 1.3 , 2.1 , 2.4 , and 3.7 @xmath152 10@xmath219 erg  s@xmath21 for the first epoch observation and wind speed of 10 , 50 , 100 , and 200 @xmath26 , respectively . for the second and third epoch observations , respectively , the upper limits for a 10 @xmath26 wind are 1.4 and 0.50 @xmath152 10@xmath219 erg  s@xmath21 , and for a 50 @xmath26 wind they are 2.2 and 0.77 @xmath152 10@xmath219 erg  s@xmath21 . for the fourth epoch observations our upper limits correspond to @xmath218 = 2.1 , 2.7 , 3.2 , and 4.8 @xmath152 10@xmath220 erg  s@xmath21 for the wind speeds of 10 , 50 , 100 , and 200 @xmath26 , respectively . in these estimates we have assumed a luminosity - weighted temperature of h@xmath8 emitting gas of @xmath158 k. from fig . 2",
    "one can see that this is a reasonable assumption since the temperature remains within @xmath118 k for all our @xmath64 models after @xmath74 days .",
    "the difference is small for models with @xmath124 .",
    "table 2 also gives upper limits for he  i  @xmath221 and he  ii  @xmath222 for the first two epochs using the same luminosity - weighted temperature .",
    "for the he  ii line , this temperature is an underestimate , but as discussed below , this does not affect our conclusions .",
    "figure 3 shows that for the earliest epoch , the limit on @xmath95 from h@xmath8 for a normal he / h abundance of the csm and @xmath223 is @xmath224 .",
    "should the wind be more helium - rich or faster , we can not place any limit on @xmath3 , neither from h@xmath8 nor he  i  @xmath221 and he  ii  @xmath222 , although the latter line comes close to the detection limit for @xmath225 for @xmath226 and @xmath223 .",
    "an even more promising helium - line to look for seems to be he  i  @xmath126 .",
    "this line could , however , not be covered by the uves observations .",
    "turning to the later epochs , we note no improvement in terms of the limit on @xmath3 from h@xmath8 , except for 85 days post explosion , for which we find the limit @xmath227 in case of @xmath228 and @xmath223 . for @xmath229 ( and @xmath228 ) , the limit goes up @xmath230 , and for still higher @xmath3 the limit goes beyond @xmath231 . for @xmath232 and @xmath223 the limit is @xmath233 . in the most favorable case of our models ,",
    "the limit on @xmath3 is thus @xmath227 ( for a normal he / h - ratio as well as slow wind ( @xmath223 ) .",
    "a more helium - rich wind degrades the limit somewhat , whereas a faster wind moves the limit on @xmath3 upwards quickly .",
    "the limit is also prone to systematic uncertainties , in particular the assumptions for the ionizing spectrum , as well as the assumption of a smooth , spherically distribution of the csm .",
    "how these effects affect the limit of @xmath3 was discussed in some detail in c96 .    [",

    "no such lines were detected .",
    "we have made detailed time dependent photoionization models for the possible circumstellar matter to interpret these non - detections .",
    "the best limit was obtained from h@xmath8 , and we put a limit on the mass loss rate from the progenitor system of @xmath227 in case of @xmath228 and @xmath223 , where @xmath46 is the wind speed in @xmath2 .",
    "these limits are sensitive to gas outside a few @xmath234  cm from the supernova .",
    "possible circumstellar matter closer to the supernova would have been swept up before our observations .",
    "the limit is slightly higher than that we found for sn  2001el ( m05 ) for which we derived @xmath235 , but similar to what c96 found for sn 1994d .",
    "however , the model for sn 1994d assumed a much slower circumstellar shock and applying the model used in this paper to the cumming et al .",
    "study of sn 1994d would increase their limit substantially .",
    "the h@xmath8 based upper limits on circumstellar matter around sne ia described in m05 for sn  2001el and here for sn  2000cx are the most sensitive so far .",
    "these results , together with the previous observational work on sn  1994d ( c96 ) disfavour a symbiotic star in the upper mass loss rate regime ( so called mira type systems ) from being the likely progenitor scenario for these sne .",
    "this is in accordance with the models of hachisu et al .",
    "( 1999a , 1999b ) , which do not indicate a mass loss rate of the binary companion in the symbiotic scenario higher than @xmath1210@xmath236 @xmath99 .",
    "stronger mass loss would initiate a powerful ( although dilute ) wind from the white dwarf that would clear the surroundings of the white dwarf , and that may even strip off some of the envelope of the companion .",
    "the white dwarf wind with its possible stripping effect , in combination with the orbital motion of the stars , is likely to create an asymmetric csm .",
    "effects of a more disk - like structure of the denser parts of the csm , and how this connects to our spherically symmetric models , are discussed by c96 in general , lower values of @xmath237 should be possible to trace in an asymmetric scenario , although uncertainties due the inclination angle and the flatness of the dense part of the csm would also be introduced .",
    "however , to push the upper limits down to the @xmath12 10@xmath236 @xmath99 level a much more nearby ( @xmath238 mpc ) sn ia needs to be observed even earlier ( @xmath239 days before the maximum light ) than our first epoch observation of sn  2001el ( m05 ) .",
    "similar , or even lower limits on @xmath237 can be obtained from x - ray , and especially radio observations ( e.g. , eck et al .",
    "2002 ) , but such observations can not disentangle the elemental composition of the gas in the same direct way as optical observations can do . the most constraining radio limit so far is that of @xmath12 10@xmath240 @xmath99 for the nearby sn  2011fe ( chomiuk et al .",
    "2012 ) which essentially rules out all likely single degenerate progenitor systems .",
    "one should , however , keep in mind that also sn  2006x was radio silent , which was used by chugai ( 2008 ) to argue for a mass loss rate below @xmath12 10@xmath241 @xmath99 for the progenitor system for that supernova , despite it possibly having circumstellar gas ( patat et al .",
    "the main problem with x - rays and radio limits , as well as the method used in this paper , is that they probe circumstellar gas through ongoing shock interaction .",
    "circumstellar gas in shell - like structures far away from the explosion site are better probed by the absorption - line method ( e.g. , patat et al .",
    "2007b ) , though a disk - like csm may be missed if the line - of - sight is not in the disk plane .",
    "for nearby sne",
    "ia it seems imperative that both high - resolution spectroscopy as early as possible and up to the first @xmath242 days should be performed , as well as continued radio monitoring for several years .",
    "sn  2011fe may provide a good testbed for such investigations . somewhat discouraging for the latter",
    "is that no sne  ia has been detected in radio , despite many of them having been nearby , as well as observed over a range of times since explosion ( eck et al . 2002 ) .",
    "for example , sn  1937c and sn  1972a did not show any radio emission at ages 48.7 and @xmath243 years , respectively",
    ". it could be that circumstellar shells in some cases are so far out that one has to wait until the remnant phase to see increased shock interaction ( chiotellis et al .",
    "the obvious exceptions are members of the sn 2002ic like supernovae .",
    "a particularly interesting case is ptf 11kx ( dilday et al .",
    "2012 ) with its circumstellar interaction turning on after maximum light .",
    "for this case , inverse compton scattering in the shocked gas should be less important than if interaction would have started immediately after the explosion .",
    "our models should therefore be applicable to this supernova after the circumstellar shock had formed .      in the insets of figs .",
    "11 and 12 , models with @xmath134 and @xmath244 were compared with late time spectra of sne  2000cx and 1998bu , respectively . from these insets",
    "it is obvious that @xmath244 of solar abundance material with a velocity of @xmath34 should have been seen in both sn  1998bu and sn  2000cx .",
    "our calculations give a lower limit on the amount of solar abundance material of @xmath245 that would not escape detection in late h@xmath8 spectra of the two supernovae .",
    "a similar limit was obtained by m05 for the late emission of sn 2001el , and leonard ( 2007 ) finds @xmath246 for sne  2005am and 2005cf using our models . as discussed in m05 , the limits we obtain for the @xmath34 solar abundance material in all those five supernovae should be conservative limits .",
    "the limit on sn  2011fe by shappee et al .",
    "( 2013b ) is even lower , @xmath247 , and rests on an extrapolation of our model simulations to masses below @xmath134 .",

    "the ablated mass is in most models below 0.01 m@xmath13 , and the observational signature would obviously in this case not be hydrogen lines , but lines from other elements .",
    "figure 5 shows that lines from o  i and ca  ii are promising probes .",
    "there is also the possibility that all the five sne  ia with a maximum of @xmath120.01 - 0.03 m@xmath13 hydrogen - rich gas , like very likely sn  2011fe ( shappee et al . 2013b ) , stem from double degenerate systems .",

    "the h@xmath8 emission emerges unattenuated , i.e. , electron scattering and line transfer are unimportant . to make even more accurate predictions of possible hydrogen / helium line emission we should use nebular emission models with a larger line list to test this , in conjunction with hydro simulations like those of pan et al .",

    "<S> we present predictions for hydrogen and helium emission line luminosities from circumstellar matter around type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) using time dependent photoionization modeling . </S>",
    "<S> early high - resolution eso / vlt optical echelle spectra of the sn  ia 2000cx were taken before and up to @xmath0 days after maximum to probe the existence of such narrow emission lines from the supernova . </S>",
    "<S> we detect no such lines , and from our modeling place an upper limit on the mass loss rate for the putative wind from the progenitor system , @xmath1 , assuming a speed of @xmath2 and solar abundances for the wind . </S>",
    "<S> if the wind would be helium - enriched and/or faster , the upper limit on @xmath3 could be significantly higher . in the helium - enriched case , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the best line to constrain the mass loss would be he  i  @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to confirming the details of interstellar na  i and ca  ii absorption towards sn  2000cx as discussed by patat et al . </S>",
    "<S> , we also find evidence for 6613.56    diffuse interstellar band ( dib ) absorption in the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss measurements of the x - ray emission from the interaction between the supernova ejecta and the wind and we re - evaluate observations of sn 1992a obtained @xmath5 days after maximum by schlegel & petre . </S>",
    "<S> we find an upper limit of @xmath6 which is significantly higher than that estimated by schlegel & petre . </S>",
    "<S> these results , together with the previous observational work on the normal sne  ia 1994d and 2001el , disfavour a symbiotic star in the upper mass loss rate regime ( so called mira type systems ) from being the likely progenitor scenario for these sne . </S>",
    "<S> our model calculations are general , and can also be used for the subclass of sne  ia that do show circumstellar interaction , e.g. , the recent ptf 11kx . to constrain hydrogen in late time spectra , </S>",
    "<S> we present eso / vlt and eso / ntt optical and infrared observations of sne  ia 1998bu and 2000cx in the nebular phase , @xmath7 days after maximum . </S>",
    "<S> we see no signs of hydrogen line emission in sne  1998bu and 2000cx at these epochs , and from the absence of h@xmath8 with a width of the order @xmath9 , we argue from modeling that the mass of such hydrogen - rich gas must be @xmath10 for both supernovae . comparing similar upper limits with recent models of pan et al . </S>",
    "<S> , it seems hydrogen - rich donors with a separation of @xmath115 times the radius of the donor may be ruled out for the five sne  ia  1998bu , 2000cx , 2001el , 2005am and 2005cf . </S>",
    "<S> larger separation , helium - rich donors , or a double - degenerate origin for these supernovae seems more likely . </S>",
    "<S> our models have also been used to put the limit on hydrogen - rich gas in the recent sn 2011fe , and for this supernova , a double - degenerate origin seems likely .    </S>",
