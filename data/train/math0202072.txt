    "in recent years cosmologists have taken a renewed interest in multiply connected 3-manifolds as possible models for the universe @xcite , motivated by upcoming opportunities to determine the topology of the real universe using satellite measurements of the microwave background @xcite and galaxy catalogs @xcite .",
    "cosmologists initially focused on closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds , favored by the low observed matter density in the universe , as well as the more easily understood flat 3-manifolds .",
    "but since 1998 it has become clear that the modest amount of matter in the universe ( 30% ) is complemented by a large amount of exotic energy ( 70% ) .",
    "this extra energy implies that the observable universe is approximately flat , or perhaps slightly spherical @xcite .",
    "cosmologists have therefore shifted their interest from hyperbolic 3-manifolds to flat and spherical ones . beyond the data",
    "s very slight preference for a spherical universe , the cosmologists new interest in multiply connected spherical 3-manifolds ( spherical spaceforms ) is due to the fact that the volume of a spherical 3-manifold decreases as the topology gets more complicated , unlike hyperbolic 3-manifolds whose volumes increase as the topology gets more complicated .",
    "thus even though both hyperbolic and spherical 3-manifolds are consistent with an approximately flat observable universe , the spherical topologies would be more easily detectable observationally @xcite .    to understand and simulate microwave background measurements in a multiply connected spherical universe",
    ", cosmologists must first understand the density fluctuations in the primordial plasma ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "such density fluctuations are expressed as linear combinations of the eigenmodes ( eigenfunctions ) of the laplacian , just as the vibration of a drumhead may be expressed as a linear combination of the drumhead s eigenmodes .",
    "but unlike mathematicians studies of isospectrality @xcite , where the spectrum was the primary object of interest ( `` can you hear the shape of a lens space ? '' ) and the eigenmodes were secondary , the cosmologists research puts the eigenmodes at center stage .",
    "more specifically , for each wave number @xmath0 ( corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath1 ) , the cosmologists want an explicit orthonormal basis for the corresponding space of eigenmodes .",
    "the present paper provides such an eigenbasis for all lens spaces ( theorem 2 , section [ sectionlensspaces ] ) and prism spaces ( theorem 3 , section [ sectionprismspaces ] ) .",
    "the determination of the eigenmodes of a lens space ( resp .",
    "prism space ) is elementary and constructive .",
    "visualize such a manifold as the 3-sphere @xmath2 under the action of a cyclic ( resp .",
    "binary dihedral ) group @xmath3 of covering transformations .",
    "the key to simplicity is to choose a coordinate system that respects the covering transformations @xmath3 .",
    "a _ toroidal coordinate system _ meets our needs perfectly ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 be the usual coordinates in @xmath8 , so the 3-sphere @xmath2 is defined by @xmath9 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 parameterize the 3-sphere as @xmath13 for @xmath14 for each fixed value of @xmath15 ,",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath12 coordinates sweep out a torus . taken together ,",
    "these tori almost fill @xmath2 .",
    "the exceptions occur at the endpoints @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where the stack of tori collapses to the circles @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the coordinates @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are everywhere orthogonal to each other .",
    "thus the metric on the 3-sphere may be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 the laplacian is just the divergence of the gradient of a function @xmath22 , and the divergence is , in turn , just the `` net outflow per unit volume '' .",
    "so by visualizing the small volume element @xmath23 we may write down the laplacian for any orthogonal coordinate system as @xmath24 with no calculation required . in the present case , substituting ( [ hvalues ] ) into ( [ generallaplacian ] ) gives the laplacian in toroidal coordinates @xmath25",
    "the wave number @xmath0 parameterizes the eigenmodes of the laplacian on the 3-sphere @xmath2 .",
    "each integer wave number @xmath26 corresponds to an eigenvalue @xmath27 with multiplicity @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the helmholtz equation thus takes the form @xmath29 we will look for solutions that factor as @xmath30 we have no _ a priori _ guarantee that all solutions must take this form , but in section [ basissection ] we ll see that the number of independent solutions of this form does indeed equal the dimension @xmath28 of the full eigenspace .",
    "substituting the expression ( [ toruslaplacian ] ) for @xmath31 and the factorization ( [ factorization ] ) of @xmath22 into the helmholtz equation ( [ helmholtzequation ] ) gives @xmath32 multiplying through by @xmath33 isolates the @xmath34 and @xmath35 factors @xmath36 the expressions in @xmath34 and @xmath35 must each be constant , and to allow a periodic solution the constants must be negative , @xmath37 the solutions are the usual circular harmonics @xmath38 and @xmath39 by convention , nonnegative @xmath40 indicates @xmath41 while negative @xmath40 indicates @xmath42 , and similarly for @xmath43 .    substituting ( [ thetaequation ] ) and ( [ phiequation ] ) into the helmholtz equation ( [ separatedvariables ] ) reduces it to a second order ordinary differential equation for @xmath44 @xmath45 for integers @xmath0 , @xmath40 , and @xmath43 satisfying @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( mod 2 ) , equation ( [ radialequation ] ) is a close relative of the jacobi equation and admits the solution @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the jacobi polynomial @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    "substituting the expressions for @xmath44 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 from ( [ radialsolution ] ) , ( [ thetasolution ] ) , and ( [ phisolution ] ) gives the eigenmode @xmath52 where as usual the choice of @xmath41 or @xmath42 ( resp .",

    "multiplied together , these factors express @xmath66 as a homogeneous degree @xmath0 harmonic polynomial in @xmath67 coordinates .",
