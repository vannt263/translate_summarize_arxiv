    "theoretical models constructed to understand physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) ( most notably string theory ) frequently imply the existence of extra dimensions . it has been a particular challenge in phenomenology to understand how these extra dimensions would be realized and manifested in our observable @xmath2 dimensional world . the number , shape and size of these dimensions , as well as the particles allowed to propagate in them give rise to several different models , all having different phenomenological implications .",
    "we will be considering universal extra dimensions ( ued ) where the sm fields propagate in all the extra dimensions .",
    "for toroidal compactification , this would imply a tower of kaluza - klein ( kk ) particles for every sm particle , each carrying kk number .",
    "momentum conservation in the extra dimensions implies kk number conservation .",
    "however , the requirement of obtaining the proper sm chiral modes at low energies leads to constraints on the possible compactification geometries .",
    "an example for @xmath3 is the orbifold @xmath4 where the @xmath5 projects out half of the zero modes , leaving only sm fields .",
    "additionally , this breaks translation invariance along the extra dimensions , so kk number is no longer conserved .",
    "a residual symmetry , kk - parity , is still present and it is sufficient to ensure the stability of the lightest kk particle ( lkp ) .",
    "it also ensures that kk particles are always produced in pairs , allowing for good agreement between theory and experiment for small values of the compactification scale , of the order of a few hundred gev  @xcite .",
    "the stability of the lkp allows for an interesting candidate for dark matter ( dm )  @xcite .",
    "the lkp is expected to be weakly interacting and electrically neutral if it is to be considered a candidate for dark matter .",
    "the usual candidate is @xmath6 , the kk partner of the hypercharge gauge boson . for @xmath7  tev ,",
    "@xmath6 gives excellent agreement with the observed relic density .",
    "there have been many further analyses of the relic density in ued , including a more proper treatment of coannihilation effects , and the impact of the inclusion of second kk level resonances  @xcite .    however , most of these studies ignore the gravitational sector",
    ". we shall mostly work within the context of one extra dimension .",
    "the gravitons couple extremely weakly and therefore are generally considered to be unimportant for collider studies .",
    "cosmologically , however , they can have a significant effect  , and they can also be a candidate for the lkp  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in investigating the inclusion of the graviton tower in the scenario with @xmath6 as the lkp .",
    "the gravitons do not evolve thermally , and have very long lifetimes , so if they are present , we expect them to decay to the lkp sometime after big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "the preservation of the light element abundances sets a bound on the amount of energy that can be released in a decay  @xcite .",
    "secondly , since the gravitons decay ultimately into the lkp , we expect the relic density to increase .",
    "therefore , the mass of the lkp consistent with the observed relic density is lowered . additionally ,",
    "if any of the gravitons decay after matter domination , we have to consider the effects of non - thermalized photons released in the decays on the spectrum of the diffuse photon flux ( dpf )  @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review the standard calculation for relic density .",
    "section 3 reiterates the calculation for the density of gravitons presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , emphasizing the points relevant for our analysis . in section 4",
    ", we analyze the lifetimes for the decay of the graviton tower and study its implication on the diffuse photon spectrum .",
    "section 5 goes over the constraints on the energy released in the decay of the kk gravitons to the lkp . in section 6",
    ", we combine the above results with the standard relic density calculation .",
    "our goal is to analyze the effect of the gravitons on the predicted mass of the lkp consistent with the known dark matter density .",
    "we will show that , in fact , almost any value of @xmath8 lower than the one obtained in the absence of gravitons would be allowed , provided the reheating temperature , @xmath9 , is large enough .",
    "for the calculation of the relic density of @xmath6 , we ignore complicating factors such as coannihilation and second kk level resonance effects  @xcite .",
    "since these effects can be parameterized in the effective cross - section , we present the effect the graviton tower will have on the mass of the lkp without the gravitons , @xmath10 , and note that as @xmath11 increases , the contribution due to the graviton tower becomes large , and should be included in any precise calculation of @xmath8 .",
    "we also find that all the gravitons , except for @xmath0 , decay right after bbn . at these early times , the electromagnetic bbn constraints are very weak",
    ". however it has been shown that at small lifetimes , the hadronic constraints are very stringent  @xcite . therefore ,",
    "including constraints from both hadronic and electromagnetic decays , requiring consistency with bbn light element predictions , we find a stringent limit on the mass difference between @xmath12 and the lkp mass , @xmath13 . since the @xmath0 is long - lived , we also derive another constraint on the mass difference such that the observed spectrum of the dpf is not destroyed . comparing the two constraints",
    ", we find that there exists a region of parameter space where both constraints are satisfied and which gives mass differences of the same order of magnitude as that obtained by radiative loop corrections to @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "additionally , we observe that if experimental evidence for ued is found , and the relic density induced by standard interactions of the kk modes is found to be lower than the one observed experimentally , the reheating temperature may be determined by assuming that the graviton kk modes provide the contribution necessary to achieve consistency between theory and experiment .",
    "alternatively , including the possibility of other unobserved exotic particles contributing to the relic density , an upper bound on the reheating temperature is obtained .",
    "let us start by recalling the computation of the density of thermal relics .",

    "( [ eq : yx ] ) enables the determination of the relic density and also the value of @xmath33 as a function of @xmath34 .",
    "the ratio of the mass to the freeze - out temperature , @xmath35 is approximately given by @xmath36 and can be solved iteratively , with @xmath37 and @xmath38 tev .",
    "as calculated in @xcite , for @xmath6 as the lkp , without including co - annihilation  , the non - relativistic approximation is : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote a summation over the fourth power of the hypercharges of fermions and bosons produced in the annihilation of @xmath6 respectively .",

    "this analysis is more complicated but a rough estimate may be obtained by assuming independent towers of kk modes for each extra dimension , @xmath48 .",
    "the current relic energy density then is simply given by @xmath49 .",
    "we will however restrict ourselves to one extra dimension in most of our numerical work .    as emphasized in the introduction ,",
    "the above derivation for the density of @xmath6 ignores the contribution of the kk modes of the gravitons , which may become relevant for sufficiently large values of the reheating temperature @xmath9 .",
    "after reheating , except for gravitons , all other particles are initially in equilibrium and follow the pattern described in the previous section .",
    "after dilution of their density due to inflation , the gravitons are produced mainly in collisions involving gauge bosons , either in the initial or the final state , with cross - sections proportional to @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the relevant gauge coupling . since their density is so small ,",
    "they are never in equilibrium and further we can ignore graviton annihilation processes to first order . because the decay times for gravitons are of the order of @xmath52 s , the gravitons produced in the early universe are still present when the lkp freezes out . as the universe cools down further",

    "it should also be noted that here we assumed that all the photons produced in the decay of the gravitons did not thermalize and are available to distort the spectrum now .",

    "the electromagnetic showers produced by the decay of @xmath108 can create and destroy light elements . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "this sets constraints on the lifetime @xmath109 of the unstable @xmath1 as well as on @xmath110 , the energy released per background photon in the decay .",
    "the dependence on @xmath109 can be understood by looking at the characteristic energy scales in the initially produced photon spectrum .",
    "the primary photon created in the decay interacts with the background and creates an em cascade .",
    "the fastest interactions are pair production and inverse compton scattering .",
    "these processes rapidly redistribute the energy and the non - thermal photons reach a quasi - static equilibrium ( qse ) .",
    "the zeroth order qse photon spectrum depends inversely on the temperature of the background plasma .",
    "if we make the _ uniform decay _ approximation , i.e. all particles decay at @xmath111 , this corresponds to a cut - off energy of @xmath112  @xcite .",
    "therefore higher energy photo - erosion processes occur for longer lifetime values .",
    "we can understand the @xmath110 dependance of photodestruction and secondary production in a similar way . in the limit of small @xmath110 , the decaying particle does not influence the light element abundances . beyond this trivial case , we can again use the uniform decay approximation to gain some insights . as long as a reaction can take place ( @xmath113 , the threshold energy for a reaction , @xmath114 ) , a typical shower photon has energy :    @xmath115    therefore , the number of such photons per decay is @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the energy released in each decay .",
    "thus , the non - thermal photon density is :    @xmath118    these photons then further thermalize as well as cause photodestruction of particles to yield other species of particles .",
    "therefore the dependence of the fractional change in the abundance of a particle is proportional to @xmath110 and inversely proportional to @xmath119 and therefore to @xmath109 .",
    "detailed numerical work gives a complicated but weak constraint on @xmath110 for getting the correct light element abundances for small lifetimes .",

    "similarly , hadrons produced in the decays can scatter off photons , electrons and , more importantly , background nuclei .",
    "scattering off photons and electrons just causes them to lose energy , but the nuclei become more energetic and cause `` hadronic showers '' .",
    "additionally if inelastic scattering occurs , the background nuclei get dissociated and the light element abundances are changed . due to the multitude of possible interactions , these are a lot more complicated to analyze than the purely electromagnetic case . previously it had always been assumed that since the branching ratio into hadrons is small , the effect would also be negligible .",
    "however detailed numerical work @xcite shows that in fact at early times , the constraints due to hadronic processes are much stronger then those due to electromagnetic processes .    as can be seen from eq .",

    "the bounds at these relatively early decay times depend strongly on the branching ratio of the decay of the gravitons into hadrons .",

    ". if most of the decay is into leptons , then the bounds on @xmath126 may be significantly weaker .",
    "a preferential decay into leptons could happen if , for any given tower , the kk leptons are very close in mass to the kk hypercharge gauge bosons , while the kk quarks are heavier ( see appendix  [ appendixb ] for calculation of the graviton decay widths into fermions )",
    ". this would be the result one would obtain if including only the radiative corrections to the kk particle masses computed in ref .  @xcite . since this is very model dependent , we will again use the most constrained case of @xmath127 tev .",
    "hence , both for early and late time decays we will use a conservative bound for the energy released per background photon , @xmath128 tev , in our numerical work .",
    "observe that while strong violations of this bound will certainly induce strong effects on the light element abundances , and therefore are ruled out , small violations of this bound are still possible due to the fact that we used very conservative limits on the energy released .",
    "one loop effects introduce corrections of two forms , constant ( independent of @xmath24 ) and proportional to @xmath24 ( bulk and boundary correction terms)@xcite .",
