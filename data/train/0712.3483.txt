    "the origin of large - scale magnetic fields is still a poorly understood subject as much as the origin of the primordial spectrum of the density contrast was unclear almost two score years ago when the first attempts of understanding the origin of large - scale structure actually begun .",
    "the first observational evidence of the existence of large - scale magnetic fields in our galaxy goes back to the work of hiltner @xcite and hall @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the problem , in itself , has many facets which can be summarized as follows :    * observational evidence of the existence of large - scale magnetic fields is indisputable from a number of different observations ranging from faraday rotation to synchrotron emission ; * objects of different sizes ( and different evolutionary histories ) possess sizable magnetic fields in the @xmath5 g range : a striking example of this statement are , for instance , spiral galaxies , elliptical galaxies and a class of x - ray bright abell clusters ; * theoretical evidence of the mechanism responsible of the degree of magnetization of the present universe is still under active discussion .",
    "we have a rather plausible control of the dynamics of electromagnetic fields in plasmas : since the pioneering work of alfvn @xcite the various descriptions of weakly coupled plasmas have been tested both in astrophysical systems and , most importantly , laboratory experiments @xcite . various plasma descriptions ( covering different branches of the spectrum of plasma excitations )",
    "allow to predict instabilities in terrestrial tokamaks .",
    "an example of successful ( but not unique ) framework is the one - fluid plasma theory which , under some circumstances , reduces to the well known magnetohrdrodynamics ( mhd in what follows ) .",
    "all the astrophysical attempts for the justification of large scale magnetic fields rest on the assumption that , at some time prior to galaxy formation , appropriate initial conditions for the mhd evolution should be present .",
    "while this point of view is shared by the whole community , opinions vary as far as the real primordial nature of magnetic fields is concerned . for informative reviews on this broad",
    "subject the interested reader may usefully consult the publications reported in @xcite ( see also @xcite for more observational aspects of large - scale magnetization ) .",
    "theoretical diatribes can not decide wether or not large - scale magnetic fields are a cosmic relic .",
    "it is more rewarding , in our opinion , to apply occam s razor and pose a more modest but yet experimentally answerable question : were large - scale magnetic fields present prior to matter - radiation equality ?",
    "the latter question is answerable since , as it will be specifically shown , the effects of large - scale magnetic fields can be read - off from the properties of cmb observables .    in recent years",
    "diverse data sets seem to conspire towards a sort of paradigm which is customarily employed in the interpretation of cosmological data . this paradigm is often dubbed as @xmath6cdm lore where @xmath6 stands for the dark - energy component ( parametrized as a cosmological constant ) and cdm stands for the cold dark matter component .",
    "the data sets supporting this general view range from the cmb data to the large - scale structure data @xcite and , finally , to the type ia supernova data in their various incarnations @xcite ( see also @xcite for weak lensing data ) .",
    "the combined analysis of these three classes of data support the @xmath6cdm paradigm .",
    "a primordial spectrum of adiabatic perturbations , present for typical wavelengths larger than the hubble radius prior to hydrogen recombination and after matter - radiation equality , is the main responsible for the normalization of the cmb temperature autocorrelations ( tt correlations in what follows ) .",
    "the cross - correlations between temperature and polarization ( te correlations in what follows ) lead to a typical anticorrelation peak @xcite which is often quoted as the golden signature of the predominant adiabaticity of the cmb initial conditions .",
    "the polarization autocorrelations ( ee correlations in what follows ) have been partially observed by the wmap experiment itself @xcite as well as by other terrestrial arrays .",
    "the viability of the @xmath6cdm paradigm is customarily completed by the addition of various parameters whose explicit determination can either confirm or improve the pure @xmath6cdm scenario . among these models we can mention , just as an example , the addition of a tensor component , the inclusion of a specific form of the barotropic index for the dark energy component ( different from the one of a pure cosmological constant ) , the search for specific corrections in the scalar power spectrum motivated , with various degrees of theoretical accuracy , by the ( yet unknown ) physics of the planck energy scale ( see , for instance , some of the analyses reported in @xcite ) .",
    "there is the hope that the unprecedented accuracy of the data of the planck explorer mission @xcite will allow to rule in ( or rule out ) some of these theoretical possibilities.cdm scenario can be confronted with the foreseeable sensitivities of the high and low frequency instruments embarked on the planck spacecraft .",
    "see , for instance , @xcite . ]",
    "the aim of this paper is to complement the @xmath6cdm paradigm with the presence of a pre - decoupling magnetic field ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "such a completion is not only motivated theoretically but also observationally : since we do observe large - scale magnetic fields later on , it is plausible to posit , as falsifiable hypothesis , their existence also prior to equality .",
    "definite answers to such a question will come , in this context , by confronting the completion of the @xmath6cdm paradigm with all the available cosmological data in the same way as , for instance , a pristine tensor contribution to the cmb anisotropies can be constrained by adding , in the parameter estimation , a stochastic background of long - wavelength gravitons . in this investigation one of the first goals of the program",
    "will be reached : a dedicated numerical approach for the magnetized cmb observables will be constructed . without this step",
    "sound strategies of parameter estimation will be forlorn .",
    "this step is often rather straightforward in different cases since all the available codes contemplate , for instance , the inclusion of tensor modes or the inclusion of a peculiar barotropic index for the dark energy component .",
    "however the latter statement does not apply to the case of large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "the analysis of the interplay between large - scale magnetic fields and cmb observables might be traced back to the pioneering works of zeldovich @xcite and harrison @xcite . in recent years",
    "it has been understood that large - scale magnetic fields may affect the vector and tensor modes of the geometry and may also affect , indirectly , the cmb polarization @xcite ( see , for instance , @xcite for a topical review on this subject ) .",
    "the main obstacle to a systematic analysis of the current data in the light of a magnetized component is represented by our lack of understanding of the close relationship between the large - scale magnetic fields and the _ scalar _ modes of the geometry .",
    "indeed , as explicitly suggested by observations , the inhomogeneities in the cmb temperature and polarization can be attributed to curvature perturbations .",
    "an impasse then seems to arise .",
    "the vector and tensor modes induced by large - scale magnetic fields are very small at large length scales ( i.e. small multipoles ) .",
    "it is thus rather hard to imagine the possibility of including the magnetic field contribution as an appropriate fit parameter in an extended version of the @xmath6cdm paradigm if the effects of magnetic fields on the scalar modes of the geometry are unknown .    a theoretical framework for the analysis of scalar modes of the geometry and large - scale magnetic fields has been recently developed in a series of papers ranging from the accurate determinations of adiabatic initial conditions in the presence of a scalar mode of the geometry @xcite , to the extension of the tight - coupling expansion @xcite and to the semi - analytical calculation of temperature autocorrelations @xcite .",
    "one of the aims of the present paper is to translate into a dedicated numerical approach all the theoretical understanding of the interplay between the scalar modes of the geometry and the large scale magnetic fields that has been pursued , through various steps , in @xcite .",
    "the cmb effects related to the scalar modes of the geometry are the most difficult ones already in the absence of large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "the complication comes from the physical observation that the density contrasts of the various species do not couple to the tensor and the vector modes but they do couple to the scalar modes of the geometry .",
    "conversely the curvature perturbations are the source of the evolution of the density contrasts for photons , for baryons and for the cdm species . in the magnetized case",
    "this occurrence is even more acute since large - scale magnetic fields and plasma effects propagate both at the level of the boltzmann hierarchy and at the level of the perturbed einstein equations .",
    "the approach studied in the present investigation is based on a faithful mhd description of the pre - decoupling plasma .",
    "more refined descriptions of the high frequency branch of the spectrum of plasma excitations ( valid for frequencies comparable with the electron plasma frequency ) must reproduce anyway the approach described here when the typical length - scales and dynamical times are , respectively , much larger than the debye length and much larger than the inverse of the plasma frequency @xcite .",
    "the plasma will not only be populated by an electromagnetic component but also by fluctuations of the geometry which should be treated relativistically since their typical wavelengths , at the onset of the numerical calculation , will be much larger than the hubble radius at the corresponding epoch .",
    "the description of the scalar modes of the geometry will be formulated in the peculiar language of the synchronous coordinate system .",
    "one of the first codes developed for the analysis of cmb anisotropies is cosmics @xcite .",
    "the cmbfast @xcite code is based originally on cosmics and in many respects it can be said that cosmics is the ancestor of cmbfast . as in cosmics , also in cmbfast the dynamical evolution across equality and decoupling is followed in the synchronous coordinate system .",
    "the synchronous approach carries necessarily a possible ambiguity on the complete removal of the gauge freedom .",
    "it is actually known since the early eighties @xcite that , in the synchronous gauge , the coordinate system is only fixed up to a pair of space - dependent integration constants .",
    "the remaining gauge freedom must be removed from the initial conditions of the boltzmann hierarchy to avoid the dangerous presence of spurious ( i.e. gauge ) modes . the way to handle this potentially annoying problem resides in the ability of treating the same problem also in contiguous gauges where the gauge parameters are completely fixed .",
    "an example of this technique is the longitudinal gauge @xcite ( see also @xcite ) which has been also exploited for this purpose in the absence of magnetic fields .",
    "this will also be the path followed in the present analysis ( see also @xcite ) by including consistently the effects due to the global magnetization of the plasma .",
    "finally , in the present study the scalar vector and tensor modes are separated on the basis of their transformation properties under three - dimensional rotations @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "there exist approaches which are fully covariant @xcite and which have been also applied to the case of large - scale magnetic fields @xcite without leading , however , to any explicit estimate either of the sachs - wolfe plateau or of the temperature autocorrelations in the doppler region as reported in @xcite .    with these specifications in mind , our code is based on cmbfast with integration along the line of sight .",
    "the main difference stems from the consistent introduction of a magnetized component both al the level of the initial conditions and at the level of the dynamical equations .",
    "this choice has been also dictated by the fact that the wmap collaboration used also cmbfast for the analysis of the observational data .",
    "it is plausible to think that this numerical approach can be also effective throughout the next decade for the analysis of forthcoming data like the ones of the planck explorer @xcite .",
    "the plan of our paper is therefore the following . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we will review the main evolution equations to be integrated .",
    "particular attention will be given to the way large - scale magnetic fields are included in the pre - equality and pre - decoupling physics . in section [ sec3 ] a theory of the magnetized initial conditions",
    "will be formulated when the dominant source of curvature inhomogeneities is the standard adiabatic mode .",
    "section [ sec4 ] is devoted to the calculation of temperature autocorrelations .",
    "the results on the polarization observables are collected in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "the distinctive features introduced in the angular power spectra by the presence of large - scale magnetic fields will be further scrutinized in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "section [ sec7 ] contains our concluding remarks . in the appendix we collected auxiliary material on the longitudinal gauge description sticking , however , only to those themes that are germane to our calculations",
    "below the temperature of neutrino decoupling , the content of the plasma is formed both by neutral species and charged species .",
    "the neutral species are cold dark matter ( cdm in what follows ) , neutrinos ( which will be taken to be massless ) and photons .",
    "the charged species are baryons and electrons .",
    "the three observational data sets ( i.e. cmb anisotropies @xcite , large - scale structure @xcite and type ia supernovae @xcite ) suggest , that a cosmological constant term should also be added .",
    "the pivotal @xmath6cdm lore is then delicately improved by positing , already prior to equality , that the primeval plasma is effectively magnetized .",
    "neutral species are indirectly affected by the presence of large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "in fact , magnetic fields gravitate and contribute both to the hamiltonian and momentum constraints as well as to the dynamical evolution of the gravitational inhomogeneities .",
    "the evolution of the charged species will be followed using mhd @xcite generalized to the situation where the geometry is dynamical and where gravitational inhomogeneities are also simultaneously present .",
    "the adoption of this scheme is dictated by the typical hierarchy of the coulomb and thompson scatterings .",
    "the position of the first doppler peak implies , in a @xmath6cdm framework , that the background geometry is spatially flat . the inclusion of spatial curvature amounts to an overall shift of the tt power spectra and hence to a change in the position of the first peak .",
    "the line element can then be written , in the conformal time coordinate @xmath7 , as : @xmath8,\\qquad a(\\tau ) d\\tau = dt ,   \\qquad { \\mathcal h } = \\frac{a'}{a } = a h. \\label{line}\\ ] ] in eq .",

    "<S> large - scale magnetic fields affect the scalar modes of the geometry whose ultimate effect is to determine the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb in what follows ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the first time , a consistent numerical approach to the magnetized cmb anisotropies is pursued with the aim of assessing the angular power spectra of temperature and polarization when the scalar modes of the geometry and a stochastic background of inhomogeneous magnetic fields are simultaneously present in the plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the effects related to the magnetized nature of the plasma are taken into account both at the level of the dynamical equations and at the level of the initial conditions of the einstein - boltzmann hierarchy . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature and polarization observables are exploited to infer the peculiar signatures of a pre - equality magnetic field . using the extrapolated best fit to the three year wmap data the increase and distortions of the first seven peaks in the tt autocorrelations </S>",
    "<S> are monitored for different values of the regularized magnetic field intensity and for the physical range of spectral indices . </S>",
    "<S> similar analyses are also conducted for the first few anticorrelation ( and corrrelation ) peaks of the te power spectra . </S>",
