    "[ sec : propagator ]    in this section , we briefly review the propagator matrix that appears in the amplitude for massless gauge bosons @xcite . we then show that the propagator matrix for an @xmath0-point amplitude with up to three massive particles ( assuming that the remaining @xmath11 particles are flavor - preserving ) is identical to that for an amplitude with all massless particles . like the latter , therefore , it has rank @xmath7 .",
    "this in turn suggests the possibility of finding a chy representation in terms of a sum over the @xmath7 solutions of the scattering equations for these amplitudes .",

    "= 10.0 cm    more generally , we can define the propagator matrix for a gauge theory amplitude with particles other than gluons by using group theory relations to rewrite the color factors in terms of a half - ladder basis ( for example , see ref .",
    "@xcite for amplitudes with a pair of particles in the fundamental representation ) . now consider an @xmath0-point amplitude with up to three massive particles , with masses @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , where the remaining @xmath26 particles are flavor - preserving . each of the individual cubic diagrams contributing to the sum ( [ cubicdecomposition ] ) can be viewed as a skeleton with three massive lines meeting at a vertex fleshed out with branches of massless lines emanating from each of the massive lines and from other massless lines ; an example is shown in fig .  1 .",

    "since the @xmath19 propagator matrix for amplitudes with massless particles has rank @xmath7 as a consequence of momentum conservation @xcite , the same is true for the propagator matrix for amplitudes with up to three massive particles .",

    "on the other hand , if there are four or more massive particles in the amplitude , the rank of the propagator matrix will generally be larger than @xmath7 .",
    "for example , the amplitude for four massive particles , one of which is flavor - preserving , has a @xmath31 propagator matrix with non - vanishing determinant , and thus rank two .",
    "[ sec : scattering ]    in order to obtain chy representations for amplitudes with massive particles , we first need the appropriate scattering equations . in this section",

    "[ deltaconstraint ] furthermore , when the constraints ( [ deltaconstraint ] ) are satisfied , the three sums _ a=1^n f_a , _",
    "a=1^n _ a f_a , _ a=1^n _",
    "a^2 f_a vanish identically ( , before imposing @xmath36 ) , which implies that only @xmath11 of the massive scattering equations ( [ massivescatt ] ) are independent .",

    "since @xmath35 vanishes in the remaining equations ( for @xmath38 ) , they are identical to the scattering equations for massless particles , and hence have the same set of @xmath7 solutions , when expressed in terms of the kinematic invariants ( [ invariants ] )",
    ". this will be crucial in the remainder of this paper .",
    "finally , we show that the massive scattering equations ( [ massivescatt ] ) are precisely the equations that arise if one regards the massive particles as massless particles in a higher - dimensional space .",
    "in particular , the momentum @xmath39 for a massless particle in @xmath40 dimensions can be written k_a  =   ( k_a | _ a ) where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the components of momentum in @xmath43- and @xmath44-dimensional subspaces respectively . and @xmath41 , but an all - plus metric for the internal components @xmath42 . ]",
    "we will refer to @xmath42 as the _ internal momentum _ of a particle ; the mass of the particle in @xmath43 dimensions is given by @xmath45 .",

    "if @xmath46 , then momentum conservation in the internal space requires @xmath47 ( for some choice of signs ) , which is too restrictive for our purposes . if @xmath48 , however , there is no constraint on the masses of the particles",
    ".    it must be stressed , however , that by no means can every massive amplitude be obtained from the dimensional reduction of a massless amplitude because momentum conservation ( including conservation of internal momentum ) must hold at each vertex of a diagram , placing severe constraints on the masses of the intermediate particles in any given diagram .",
    "a simple example will suffice to explain the difficulty .",
    "consider the four - point amplitude involving @xmath49 , @xmath43 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . since the @xmath51 is flavor- and therefore mass - preserving , conservation of momentum at any vertex involving the @xmath51 implies that @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the internal momentum for @xmath49 , @xmath43 , or @xmath50 .",
    "together with overall internal momentum conservation ( @xmath54 ) , this implies that @xmath55 , which implies that the @xmath56 must be massless .",
    "for the amplitudes considered in this paper , however , with ( up to ) three massive particles , and the remaining ( massless ) particles flavor - preserving , internal momentum conservation at each vertex involving a massless ( @xmath57 ) flavor - conserving particle holds automatically , and internal momentum conservation at the vertex involving the three massive particles , @xmath58 , is easily satisfied for appropriate choices of @xmath53 .",
    "[ sec : double ]    in this section , we show that the propagator matrix ( [ propagatormatrix ] ) for an amplitude with up to three massive particles can be written as a sum over the solutions of the scattering equations ( [ massivescatt ] ) .",

    "[ sec : scattering ] that kinematically we can regard the scattering of @xmath0 particles ( up to three of them massive and the rest flavor - preserving ) in @xmath43 dimensions as the scattering of @xmath0 massless particles in @xmath59 dimensions , with the same propagator matrix .",
    "next , recall that cachazo , he , and yuan @xcite demonstrated that the entries of the propagator matrix for massless amplitudes can be interpreted as double - partial amplitudes of a theory of massless scalar particles transforming in the adjoint of the color group @xmath60 and presented a compact formula for computing them .",

    "define the nonsingular matrix @xmath64 by removing rows @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , and columns @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , and let @xmath71 be its signed determinant . the combination  ( ) [ detphi ] where @xmath72 , was then shown to be independent of the choices of removed rows and columns .",
    "chy then demonstrated that the entries of the propagator matrix can be computed using m ( 1 n | 1 n )  =   [ doublepartialk ] where the sum is over the @xmath7 solutions of the scattering equations ( [ kscatt ] ) .",
    "now we need to rewrite in terms of @xmath43-dimensional quantities .",
    "since @xmath73 is independent of the choices of removed rows and columns , we can choose to remove the rows and columns associated with the massive particles ( 1 , 2 , and @xmath0 ) .",
    "since the remaining rows and columns correspond to massless particles ( with @xmath74 ) , the numerators in @xmath75 are given by @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which are precisely the set of kinematic invariants ( [ invariants ] ) .",
    "this implies that ",
    "( )  =    ( ) . provided that the determinant is expressed in terms of the invariants ( [ invariants ] ) .",
    "furthermore , as we saw in sec .",
    "[ sec : scattering ] , the massless scattering equations in @xmath59 dimensions ( [ kscatt ] ) are precisely equivalent to the massive scattering equations in @xmath43 dimensions ( [ massivescatt ] ) , and therefore have the same solutions .",
    "thus , the propagator matrix for the massive amplitude is given by m ( 1 n | 1 n )  =   [ doublepartialk ] where the sum is over the solutions of the scattering equations ( [ massivescatt ] ) .",

    "hence , for an amplitude with up to three massive particles is the same as that for massless amplitudes , as we already saw in sec .",
    "[ sec : propagator ] .",
    "[ sec : gauge ]    in this section , we demonstrate that various gauge theory amplitudes involving up to three massive particles can be expressed , like those for massless particles , as a sum over the @xmath7 solutions of the scattering equations",

    "it is apparent that color - kinematic dual numerators @xmath83 can be used to construct e ( )  =   _ s_n-2 [ enum ] so that implies that are equivalent .",
    "the novelty of the chy approach , however , is in providing an alternative definition for @xmath84 in terms of the pfaffian of a matrix , so that yields the gauge theory amplitudes directly without resort to feynman diagrams .",
    "one first defines a @xmath85 matrix ( )  =   (    cc a & -c^t + c & b +    ) [ defpsi ] where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 are the @xmath61 submatrices a_ab =    , & ab ; +   0 , & a = b ;     b_ab =    , & ab ; +   0 , & a = b ;     c_ab =    , & ab ; + -_ca , & a = b .

    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the resulting `` reduced pfaffian '' is independent ( when the scattering equations are satisfied ) of the choice of rows and columns deleted , but for our purposes ( in order to make manifest the mass independence of the result ) it will prove advantageous to choose ones corresponding to two of the massive particles .",
    "we therefore define @xmath90 as the matrix obtained by deleting the 1st and @xmath0th rows and columns from @xmath89 , in which case the chy prescription is e ( )  =   _ 1,n ( ) .",
