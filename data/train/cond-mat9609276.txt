    "it is well known that the three dimensional ( 3d ) isotropic anderson model exhibits a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) : increasing the disorder of the random potential site energies causes the wave functions to localize .",

    "accurately , the transfer - matrix method ( tmm ) together with the one - parameter finite - size scaling hypothesis applied to quasi-1d bars has been used with much success in the past .",
    "@xcite recently , the _ anisotropic _ anderson model has received much attention in connection with the anisotropic transport properties of the high @xmath4 cuprates and a possible contradiction to the scaling theory of localization was mentioned@xcite supported by a diagrammatic analysis .",
    "@xcite however , recent tmm studies@xcite show that the one - parameter scaling theory is still valid and further that an mit exists even for strong hopping anisotropy @xmath5 .",
    "the values of the critical disorder in the band center were found to follow a power law @xmath6 independent of the orientation of the quasi-1d bar .",
    "@xmath7 was argued to be independent of the strength of the anisotropy .    here , we shall study the problem of anderson localization by a different method : we focus our attention directly on the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian . in an infinite system",
    "the wave functions are expected to be localized on the insulating side and extended on the metallic side even arbitrarily close to the transition . as first suggested by aoki@xcite the fractal nature of the critical eigenstates can connect these discrepant characteristics . indeed , large fluctuations of the wave functions have been observed numerically which dominate  at least at small length scales  the character of the states and invalidate the simple notions of exponentially localized or homogeneously extended states .",
    "approaching the transition these fluctuations increase and at the critical disorder they are expected to occur on all length scales .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that such wave functions are multifractal entities . to characterize the eigenstates of the isotropic anderson model",
    "the singularity spectrum @xmath8 has been used successfully.@xcite a _ characteristic spectrum _",
    "@xmath9 was shown to determine the mobility edge independent of the microscopic details of the sample.@xcite further , around its maximum , @xmath9 agrees well with an analytical result of wegner@xcite based on a nonlinear @xmath10 model calculation .",
    "near the critical disorder @xmath1 , characteristic changes of @xmath8 were observed when the system size was increased.@xcite these distinguish the localized and the extended character of the states and therefore allow us to determine the transition directly from multifractal properties of eigenstates .",

    "hence , for @xmath26 we recover the isotropic 3d case and @xmath27 corresponds to @xmath28 independent planes or @xmath29 independent chains .",
    "the direction with normal ( reduced ) transfer integral is called the parallel ( perpendicular ) direction .    the lanczos algorithm,@xcite which is well suited for the diagonalization of sparse matrices ,",
    "allows us to solve the eigenvalue equation @xmath30 for system sizes up to @xmath31 , yielding eigenvalue / eigenvector pairs in a requested energy range .",
    "we use state - of - the - art workstations and a parallel computer with 128 powerpc processors .",
    "it takes about 11 hours to diagonalize the anderson hamiltonian with @xmath32 on the parallel machine using 8 processors .",
    "the workstations need about 35 hours for the same calculation .",
    "since we also have to perform a statistical averaging over different disorder configurations , we have restricted the systematic investigations to sizes up to @xmath32 . in order to allow a direct comparison with the results of refs .",
    ", we restrict our study to the states in the center of the band such that @xmath33 . numerically this is the worst case because of the high density of states there which requires a very large tridiagonal matrix in the lanczos algorithm to determine the eigenvalues .",
    "fractal measures are widely used in physics to characterize objects such as percolating clusters , random walks , and random surfaces .",
    "@xcite the common geometric feature of such point sets is the self - similarity : parts of the set are similar to the whole , at least in a statistical sense .",
    "however , for fluctuating physical quantities such as the probability amplitude of an eigenstate @xmath34 of the anderson model , the appropriate concept is given by the multifractal measures : if the mentioned fluctuations are statistically the same on every length scale , i.e. , if all the moments of the investigated quantity are self similar , the object is ( statistically ) self - affine and is called a multifractal .    a characteristic property of multifractals is their singularity spectrum @xmath8.@xcite let us briefly describe an algorithm to determine this quantity , based on the standard box counting procedure : we consider a volume @xmath35 in our @xmath36 dimensional space which contains the support of the physical variable , i.e. , all points where the variable is defined .",
    "we cover it with a number of  boxes  of linear size @xmath37 .",
    "the actual shape of the boxes is not important , they may be spheres as well .",
    "next , we determine the contents @xmath38 of each box @xmath39 by summing or integrating the investigated quantity over the part of the support inside the box . for a self - affine object one",

    "a multifractal object consists of a ( infinite ) number of subsets @xmath43 with different fractal dimensions .    in the present work",
    "we shall use an equivalent but numerically more convenient algorithm to compute the singularity spectrum .",
    "our physical quantity is again the probability amplitude of eigenstates . considering the normalized @xmath47th moments of the box probability",
    "@xmath48 it is possible to find@xcite a parametric expression of @xmath8 such that @xmath49 we plot the sums in ( [ f_von_alpha ] ) versus @xmath50 and observe multifractal behavior if and only if the data may be well fitted by straight lines .",
    "the slope from the linear regression procedure used in the fit gives @xmath51 and @xmath44 .",

    ", @xmath8 is a nonnegative , convex function with @xmath52 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath8 at @xmath53 equals the dimension of the support , i.e. , the fractal dimension @xmath54 of the subset of points where the investigated quantity is not zero . for our wave functions @xmath55 because they are nowhere exactly zero .",

    "d_-dimensional support .",
    "( i ) a uniform distribution is represented by the single point @xmath62 in the singularity spectrum , because @xmath63 for every point of the support .",
    "( ii ) with increasing localization the spectrum becomes wider and an extremely localized distribution with measure @xmath20 at one point and @xmath64 elsewhere has a spectrum which consists of two points only : @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "this is because the box around the maximum has contents @xmath20 for each @xmath67 , so @xmath44 is @xmath64 for this single point while all other points have @xmath68 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : typ_spec ] we show two typical singularity spectra of 3d wave functions corresponding to a localized and an extended wave function .",
    "the tendency towards the 2 limiting cases can be seen for these two examples already : the extended state has a narrow @xmath8 curve close to @xmath69 while the localized wave function is represented by a very wide spectrum with larger @xmath70 and smaller @xmath60 .",
    "as has been shown in refs .   by the tmm , the anisotropic anderson model still exhibits a mit for all @xmath72 in the band center @xmath33 and , by the general arguments given above , we expect the wave functions at the transition point to be multifractals just as in the isotropic case . as a check we have computed various eigenstates close to the proposed@xcite critical disorders @xmath1 for system sizes up to @xmath32 . in fig .",

    "we find even for very strong anisotropies @xmath74 that the sums in eq .",
    "( [ f_von_alpha ] ) , plotted versus @xmath75 are linear .",
    "therefore , we do find multifractal behavior of the wave functions close to the critical disorder for the anisotropic anderson model .",
    "every singularity spectrum is characteristic only for the particular configuration of the site energies .",
    "but for a given set of parameters @xmath76 the different @xmath8 curves fluctuate around one singularity spectrum . in order to suppress these statistical fluctuations we average the spectra obtained from @xmath77 to @xmath78 eigenstates close to @xmath33 for 12 realizations of the random site energies .",
    "the averaged spectrum is thus characteristic for the set of parameters @xmath76 and will be used in the next sections to compute the critical disorder @xmath1 as a function of the anisotropy @xmath5 .      in the isotropic case",
    "characteristic singularity spectrum _",
    "@xmath9 was found previously@xcite at all points of the mobility edge independent of the microscopic details of the system such as the probability distribution of the site energies .",
    "the region close to the maximum of @xmath9 is described well by an analytical result of wegner@xcite from the @xmath79 expansion of the non - linear @xmath10 model , i.e. , @xmath80 as a hypothesis we shall now assume that this characteristic spectrum determines the transition even in the case of anisotropic hopping .",
    "this hypothesis is certainly valid in the limit @xmath81 but needs further support for larger anisotropies .",
    "we find that for each anisotropy @xmath5 there exists a corresponding @xmath82 such that the eigenstates are characterized by @xmath83 .",
    "identifying @xmath84 gives us an estimate for the @xmath5 dependence of the critical disorder .",
    "note that since the singularity spectrum should be independent of the system size at the transition point , it is sufficient to investigate small systems .",
    "we have used systems with @xmath85 for the results presented in this section .      assuming the validity of @xmath83 we find a crossover between two power laws in the @xmath5 dependence of the critical disorder : @xmath86 for @xmath87 and @xmath88 for @xmath89 as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : wcaebenen ] .",
    "this does not agree with the results of ref .  , where @xmath90 has been calculated within the self - consistent theory of localization and where the single power law @xmath91 has been deduced from the tmm data .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : wcaketten ] the results for @xmath71 for weakly coupled chains are shown . using @xmath83",
    "we find @xmath92 which is very similar to the tmm data@xcite @xmath93 .",
    "the difference becomes significant only for very large @xmath94 .",
    "the exponent @xmath95 was obtained from a fit of the tmm data over the whole @xmath5 range . for large @xmath5",
    "the authors of ref .   get @xmath96 .",
    "this is consistent with the result of ref .  .",
    "we have shown in the last section , that the assumption of the characteristic @xmath83 leads to large differences in the estimates of @xmath1 between the tmm results @xcite and our results based on the multifractal analysis .",
    "thus we will now use a more direct method to estimate @xmath71 from the multifractal properties of the eigenstates . from the isotropic case it is known@xcite that multifractal behavior",
    "is found not only directly at the critical disorder @xmath1 but also close to the transition .",
    "the reason is the finite sample size which is much smaller than the characteristic length scales of the states close to @xmath1 . in this range",
    "the exponential decay or uniformly extended character of the wave function is masked by large fluctuations and it is not obvious to which side of the mit a given state belongs . due to the relatively small sample size the system is very sensitive to its boundary .",
    "correspondingly , a characteristic change in the singularity spectrum is observed when the system size is increased .",
    "this change can be evaluated to distinguish the localized or extended character of the wave function . for an extended state",
    "the @xmath8 curve becomes narrower and the maximum position is shifted towards smaller values of @xmath44 , approaching the value 3 .",
    "the opposite behavior is found for a localized state .",
    "thus the spectra tend towards the extreme cases discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - multi ] .",
    "indeed we expect these limiting cases , namely @xmath69 for the metallic side and @xmath97 and @xmath98 for the insulating side , to be reached for infinitely large system size for any disorder except @xmath1 .",
    "only directly at the transition the wave functions are multifractal , the fluctuations are the same on all length scales , and @xmath8 is independent of the system size .",
    "this makes is feasible to determine the critical disorder by analyzing the system - size dependence of the singularity spectra.@xcite      we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : fvonw02 ] an example of weakly coupled planes with @xmath99 .",
    "the above described different behaviors of the spectra can be seen . for @xmath100 , a larger system size results in a narrower @xmath8 curve which is characteristic for extended states . on the other hand ,",
    "the increase in the system size for @xmath101 yields a widening of the spectrum indicating localized states . the singularity spectrum for @xmath102 is least effected by the change of the system size and we thus conclude a critical disorder @xmath103 .",
    "considering the error bars , the @xmath8 curve for @xmath1 equals the characteristic spectrum @xmath83 of the isotropic case . for moderate anisotropies",
    "@xmath104 this confirms the hypothesis of a characteristic @xmath83 .    visual observation of the system - size dependence of the @xmath8 curves is not well suited for a systematic search for the transition .",
    "a better method is to focus attention to special points of the spectra such as the position @xmath70 of the maximum and the information dimension @xmath105 .",
    "an increase of the system size causes a decreasing @xmath70 and a increasing @xmath60 for extended states and the opposite tendency for localized states@xcite as described in sec .",
    "[ sec - multi ] . a constant behavior of @xmath70 and @xmath60 versus system size indicates @xmath1 .",
    "following ref .",
    "we have parameterized the system - size dependence by @xmath106 which has been found to give a nearly linear behavior of @xmath70 and @xmath60 thus distinguishing their tendencies more clearly.@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : sys04 ] we find a constant behavior at the same value of the disorder for both quantities and we conclude @xmath107 .    for very weakly coupled planes we get significantly larger values of @xmath1 than in sec .",
    "[ sec - res - us ] .",
    "the new values are close to , but slightly larger than the tmm data@xcite as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : wcaebenen ] .",
    "our data follow @xmath108 which confirms the exponent @xmath90 derived analytically.@xcite we therefore conclude that @xmath83 is no longer characteristic for the eigenstates at the mit for weakly coupled planes with @xmath109 . in our present analysis",
    "we find wider singularity spectra which is a sign of a tendency towards localization .",
    "an eigenstate at the transition for very strong anisotropy @xmath74 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : awf01 ] .",
    "the probability amplitude is concentrated to a few planes perpendicular to the direction with reduced transfer .",
    "this coincides with the observation that the localization length is smaller by a factor @xmath110 in the perpendicular direction compared with the parallel one.@xcite in the mentioned planes the wave function looks like a fractal with holes and islands of different sizes , very similar to the critical eigenstates of the isotropic system .",
    "it may well be that the cubic boxes used in the box - counting procedure for the multifractal analysis can not appropriately measure this fractal , because most box sizes exceed the number of planes on which the wave functions are concentrated .",
    "therefore it is possible that the deviations of @xmath82 from @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : wcaebenen ] are an artefact of the analysis .",
    "the results for the @xmath71 dependence of weakly coupled chains are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wcaketten ] .",
    "they are in reasonable agreement with the tmm data , @xcite although we can not reproduce the exponent@xcite @xmath96 .",
    "the differences between @xmath1 and @xmath82 are not as large as in the other case and the multifractal properties of the critical states are therefore similar to those of the isotropic system .",
    "the transport properties are determined by the localization properties of the states . at @xmath111",
    "localized states can not contribute to charge transfer and we have insulating behavior . on the other hand ,",
    "extended states yield metallic behavior .",
    "the kubo formula following from fermi s golden rule provides a connection of the electrical conductivity and the electronic states @xmath112 .",
    "let us consider an electrical ac field with frequency @xmath113 in @xmath114 direction on an sample with volume @xmath13 .",
    "we assume a half - filled band at @xmath111 such that all states with @xmath115 are occupied while all others are unoccupied . a configuration average because of the random site energies is denoted by @xmath116 .",
    "neglecting prefactors the real part @xmath10 of the conductivity is given by@xcite @xmath117    in order to compute this quantity it is necessary to know all eigenvalues and all eigenstates .",
    "we use the standard householder algorithm to diagonalize the hamiltonian ( [ hand ] ) .",
    "we average over 90 to 150 configurations to suppress the large statistical fluctuations of @xmath10 .",
    "this limits the treatable linear system size to @xmath118 . as a consequence we encounter strong finite - size effects for @xmath119 .",
    "the small number of eigenenergies in the ordered limit is not smeared out sufficiently by the disorder to yield a smooth density of states @xmath120 as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ne ] for @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "we also note that the density of states for larger disorder values and @xmath123 agrees with that of the respective 1d or 2d system within the uncertainty due to fluctuations . however , the transport behavior of the states is completely different : in 1d and 2d there is no mit ( @xmath124 ) while 3d systems exhibit an mit even for very strong anisotropy as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec - res ] .",
    "because the characteristic length scales of the wave functions exceed the system size it is a priori not clear whether the localization behavior of the states has any measurable influence on the computed conductivity .",
    "suppose there is no such influence , then the matrix elements @xmath125 are all be equal and the conductivity is given by the @xmath126-weighted joint density of states @xmath127 .",
    "we compare @xmath10 and @xmath128 for weakly coupled planes with , e.g. @xmath121 and @xmath122 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpe01+uniform ] . the peak structure for this small disorder is a again finite size effect reflecting the peaks of @xmath129 .",
    "the positions of the minima of @xmath130 are the same as expected from the joint density of states but the minima are much more pronounced .",
    "the reason for this behavior is the strong localization of the states for energies with low @xmath129 similar to the localization in the band tails ; the latter causes the decrease of @xmath10 at higher energies .",
    "thus despite the small system size the conductivity is highly influenced by localization effects .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : l_gamma ] we present the conductivity computed for the two nonequivalent directions : parallel ( a ) , ( c ) and perpendicular ( b ) , ( d ) to the planes and chains , respectively . for strong anisotropy",
    "the wave functions are concentrated to a few chains or planes as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : awf01 ] .",
    "consequently , the conductivity is drastically reduced in the perpendicular direction . for @xmath122",
    "the maximum of @xmath10 is reached at small energies because the most extended eigenstates appear in the band center .",
    "this causes the ( small ) peak for @xmath121 . for strong disorder @xmath131",
    "all eigenstates are strongly localized and the perpendicular conductivity is nearly negligible . for the parallel conductivity we find an increase if the anisotropy becomes stronger . here , the transport is not handicapped by the anisotropic localization of the wave functions .",
    "the increase is relatively small for the planes and considerable for the chains .",
    "a good argument to explain this difference is the form of the density of states which yields a higher amount of possibly transitions for the energies around the position of the maximum of @xmath130 for the second .",
    "the parallel conductivity at @xmath131 is relatively small but considerable in a large energy range which reflects the disorder widened energy band .",
    "we note that the conductivities for a very strong anisotropy @xmath74 are nearly equal to those of @xmath122 in the parallel direction and again negligible in the perpendicular direction .",
    "in the present work we have studied the localization behavior of eigenfunctions and transport properties of the anderson model with anisotropic hopping .",
    "as expected from the general argument for the fractal nature of wave functions at the metal - insulator transition , multifractal eigenstates were found even for strong anisotropy .",
    "the multifractal description holds not only directly at the transition but also close to it due to the small system sizes considered . as a first estimate for the critical disorder @xmath1 we determined that @xmath82 where the states show the characteristic singularity spectrum @xmath9 which indicates the mit in the isotropic case . but especially for weakly coupled planes the computed anisotropy dependence of the critical disorder differs remarkably from the tmm results .",
    "@xcite we also analyzed the system - size dependences of the singularity spectra to determine the mit .",
    "the observed @xmath71 agree reasonably well with the tmm data.@xcite therefore we conclude that the  characteristic spectrum  is no longer valid if the anisotropy becomes strong .",
    "this is surprising because @xmath83 was independent of the microscopic details of the isotropic system for the 3d case .",
    "the spectrum at @xmath1 for weakly coupled planes is wider than @xmath83 .",
    "this coincides with the observed concentration of the probability amplitude to only a few planes perpendicular to the direction with reduced hopping for large anisotropy .",
    "we have also studied the ac conductivity of small anisotropic samples using kubo s formula . in this case",
    "the treatable system sizes are very small because all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian are needed .",

    "this is a pure localization effect . for",
    "the used small system size @xmath118 it is surprising that this can be observed , because the characteristic length scales are much larger for nearly all of the states . another",
