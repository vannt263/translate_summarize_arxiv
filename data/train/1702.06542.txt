    "because of the high surface gravities ( log @xmath1 ) of white dwarfs , heavy elements sink out of their photosphere on timescales much shorter than their cooling ages @xcite .",
    "this process of gravitational settling leads to stratified atmospheres with outer layers purely composed of the lightest elements , h or he .",
    "however 25 to 50 percent of all white dwarfs also show photospheric contamination by trace metal species ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the now widely accepted explanation for the origin of these metals is accretion of tidally disrupted planetesimals @xcite .",
    "white dwarf classification is purely based on spectroscopic appearance with the two main classes being spectra dominated by balmer lines ( called da ) and those dominated by he i absorption ( called db ) .",
    "in most white dwarfs the element dominating the spectroscopic appearance ( h or he ) also corresponds to the main component of the star s atmosphere . in both magnitude",
    "limited and volume limited samples @xmath2 per cent of white dwarfs have h atmospheres with the remaining @xmath3 per cent having he ones @xcite .",
    "several detailed spectroscopic studies have shown that a significant fraction of he atmosphere white dwarfs also show h@xmath4 absorption @xcite . in this article",
    "we refer to these stars as he+h white dwarfs or he+h+z white dwarfs , if also metals are detected .",
    "similarly , stars with no detectable h are referred to as he and he+z white dwarfs .",
    "in contrast to metal contamination , the origin of h in he - atmosphere white dwarfs is still under discussion .",
    "most recently @xcite ( @xcite , from here on kk15 ) carried out a comprehensive analysis of 1107 he white dwarfs , ultimately stating that the atmospheric composition of he+h white dwarfs is most likely the result of convective mixing of a primordial h layer .",
    "in other words , kk15 argued that he+h white dwarfs begin their life with relatively thin h layers which get progressively diluted by the underlying he envelope as the stars cool and develop increasingly deep convection zones .    a handful of he - atmosphere white dwarfs are known to have exceptionally high h abundance .",
    "one outstanding example is the metal polluted white dwarf gd16 ( also known as hs0146 + 1847 , @xcite ) which , despite showing a spectrum dominated by h absorption , has actually a he atmosphere with a large h component and metal contamination . to date",
    ", only three similar white dwarfs have been discovered , all of which are also metal polluted ( gd362 , pg1225@xmath5079 , and sdssj124231.07 + 522626.6 , see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) . here",
    "we report new spectroscopy of gd16 , and the discovery of an additional white dwarf with similar properties and name , gd17 ( also known as sdssj014934.45 + 240046.75 ) .",
    "we present a detailed study of the atmospheric composition of gd16 and gd17 , and discuss the nature of the accreted material . @xcite and @xcite showed that the excess abundance of accreted o in gd61 and sdssj1242 + 5226 could be linked to ongoing ( or recent ) accretion of water - bearing planetary debris which would also explain the exceptional h content .",
    "however h never diffuses down in the atmosphere of white dwarfs , and could , therefore , be a detectable record of past accretion episodes of water - bearing planetesimals long after the metals associated with this event have diffused out of sight . in order to explore this hypothesis",
    "we analyse the sample of he white dwarfs examined by kk15 exploring the correlation between the presence of trace h and metal pollution .",
    "independent on whether the currently detected accretion event is dry ( e.g. @xcite ) or wet ( e.g. @xcite ) , the detection of metals is an unambiguous signpost for the presence of planetary systems at these white dwarfs .",
    "we find that the incidence of h in metal polluted white dwarfs ( i.e. he+h+z ) is far higher than in their metal - free counterparts ( he+h ) .",
    "this statistically significant result , combined with the unusual composition of gd16 and gd17 strongly suggests that a significant number of he+h+z white dwarfs have acquired at least some of their atmospheric h via accretion of water - bearing planetary remnants .",
    "gd17 was first identified from the inspection of its sdss spectrum ( fig.[gd17_sdss ] ) by @xcite and independently by @xcite .",
    "the sdss spectrum does not contain any he i absorption , but the asymmetric shape of h@xmath6 suggests an unusual atmospheric composition .",
    "we obtained additional optical spectra of gd17 on 2013 september 4 at the mmt observatory on mt .",
    "hopkins ( az ) . the star was observed using the blue channel spectrograph facility instrument and the echellette grating , providing simultaneous coverage over 3100@xmath57200 . in practice ,",
    "the bluest order has a blaze function that is difficult to correct , and therefore the shortest usable wavelength range is 3200@xmath53300 .",
    "gd17 was placed on a @xmath7 slit for seven integrations of 1200s each , yielding a total on - source time of 140min .",
    "a resolving power of @xmath8 was measured from the full width at half maximum of the oi 5577  sky line .",
    "the spectrophotometric standard star bd+284211 was observed in a similar manner , as were henear comparison lamps for wavelength calibration .",
    "the data were reduced manually using the echelle package within iraf .",
    "a bias frame was subtracted from each exposure , and individual , order - separated spectra were extracted from each resulting frame .",
    "no correction was made for scattered light , nor was flatfielding performed ; the available lamps produce insufficient signal in the bluest three orders . the bright standard was extracted and used as a reference to extract the arc lamp and science target , as the latter were difficult to trace in the highest and lowest orders , especially near their edges .",
    "the science target data were extracted using a median sky subtraction , variance weighting , and a cleaning algorithm for outliers ( e.g.  cosmic rays ) .",
    "the extracted spectral orders for gd17 were wavelength calibrated using the comparison lamp data , and relative flux calibration was performed by comparing the standard star observations with the spectrophotometric database , and thereby removing the instrument response . a final spectrum for each echellette order was created via a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) weighted average of individual spectra .",
    "a combined spectrum was obtained joining all orders together and averaging the flux in the overlapping regions .",
    "new optical observations of gd16 were obtained at the vlt observatory on 2014 october 20 with the x - shooter spectrograph @xcite in stare mode , in photometric conditions using a @xmath7 slit aperture for the uvb arm and @xmath9 for the vis arm .",
    "we acquired a single exposure of 1221s and 1255s for the uvb and vis arm respectively ( fig.[gd17_sdss ] ) . using a sky line at 8060 we measure a full width at half maximum of 1.01 corresponding to a resolving power of @xmath10 at this wavelength .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the standard procedures within the reflex reduction tool developed by eso .",
    "the spectral data in the nir arm had s / n @xmath11 5 and was thus insufficient for analysis .",
    "@xcite found that no satisfactory fit of the balmer lines could be achieved using pure h atmosphere models , which led to the realization that gd16 has a he dominated atmosphere . in cool",

    "we adopt these parameters as the starting point for analysing the x - shooter spectrum of gd16 .",
    "fixing log@xmath1 = 8.0 , we calculated a grid of model atmospheres with @xmath13 and the ca and h abundances as free parameters . in order to achieve a good fit",
    ", we had to adjust the line broadening parameters and assume a particularly weak neutral he to h interaction .",

    "three of these stars ( gd16 , gd362 and pg1225@xmath5079 ) also have dusty debris discs detected in the infrared @xcite .",
    "the fact that the five he atmosphere white dwarfs with the highest h content known to date are all showing the signature of the ongoing or recent accretion of rocky planetary remnants invites the speculation that the h in these white dwarfs could have been delivered alongside the metal pollutants .",

    "this star shows o abundance significantly in excess to what is expected for the accretion of rocky material , i.e. common metal oxides .",
    "the accretion of water - bearing bodies also provide an explanation for the large h content of this white dwarf @xcite .",
    "in contrast , gd362 does not show any detectable o absorption lines , and the upper limits on the o abundance reveal that the debris causing the currently observable metal pollution could not have had a significant water component @xcite .",
    "similarly neither gd16 nor gd17 show detectable o lines in their spectra , but our upper limits on the o abundance for these two stars are less constraining than those found for gd362 ( table[gd16_mass ] ) .",
    "however h never diffuses out of the atmospheres of white dwarfs , in contrast to metals which disappear from sight on timescales of @xmath56 yr .",
    "even though the metals currently in the atmosphere of these stars do not contain any water , h may be a relic of past accretion events .",
    "@xcite already proposed that the unusually abundant h in the the atmosphere of gd362 , could be the result of accretion of water - bearing debris . @xcite",
    "further extended this idea suggesting that , the pattern of h abundances in cool metal polluted white dwarfs is likely a reflection of the diversity of water content in extrasolar planetesimals .",
    "in accordance with this hypothesis we speculate that the h in gd16 and gd17 , and potentially in he atmosphere white dwarfs in general could be a lasting record of water accretion , independently of the detection of o.",
    "without reliable detection of an o excess , the presence of trace h in a single he atmosphere white dwarf ( even in exceptional cases like gd16 and gd17 ) does not , on its own , represent evidence of accretion of water - bearing debris . in order to assess whether trace h in he atmosphere white dwarfs is an indicator of water accretion it is therefore necessary to look at the overall population of he atmosphere white dwarfs .",
    "we closely examined the sample of sdss he white dwarfs analysed by kk15 . in their study , kk15 excluded spectra with s / n @xmath57 and all objects with peculiarities , such as stars with low mass companions , stars with he ii lines ( do ) and obviously magnetic stars .",

    "this is in agreement with other previous studies that similarly opposed ism accretion as the most likely h delivery mechanism @xcite .",
    "kk15 concluded that the h present in he+h white dwarfs is most likely primordial and accretion plays no significant role .",
    "in other words kk15 suggested that he+h white dwarfs begin their lives with relatively thin h layers which become diluted by the underlying he envelope as the stars cool and develop deeper convection zones .",
    "however , from a closer analysis of the he white dwarfs sample considered by kk15 , we find some evidence that can not be explained by the primordial origin of h. in the primordial h scenario , he+h white dwarfs formed with the same mass of h that we measure today . indeed",
    ", in order to explain the range of h masses measured for he+h white dwarfs , kk15 concluded that they must form with h layers ranging from the thick h envelopes of das to ultra thin h - layers with masses as low as @xmath63@xmath64  and that all stars with @xmath65@xmath64  will eventually evolve into he+h white dwarfs .",
    "in other words , as white dwarfs cool they should simply move horizontally from right to left in fig.[h_mass_plot ] .",
    "however the observed distribution of he+h white dwarfs , in the temperature range where both h and he are detectable ( the area in between the red curves in fig.[h_mass_plot ] ) , is significantly inhomogeneous with most objects clustering close to the lower detection limit ( solid red line ) . stars with large amounts of h in their he envelopes such as gd16 , gd17 , and gd362 are clearly exceptional . under the assumption",
    "that all h in these stars is primordial , this distribution implies that the prior stellar evolution of white dwarfs leads preferentially to the formation of thick h layers ( and so h - atmosphere white dwarfs ) , or to thin h layers with masses in the range @xmath66@xmath64 , but only rarely to layers of intermediate thickness .",
    "kk15 attempted to explain the origin of all he+h white dwarfs with a single mechanism .",
    "here we suggest as an alternative scenario : the existence of an additional mechanism which contributes to the formation of he+h white dwarfs .",
    "about 10@xmath512 per cent of the he white dwarfs examined by kk15 are also contaminated by traces of ca .",
    "today the standard model for atmospheric metals in white dwarfs is accretion of rocky planetesimals @xcite .",
    "these heavy elements are therefore not related to stellar evolution .",
    "we investigated the correlation between the presence of h and that of ca in the he white dwarfs in kk15 sample .",
    "the detectability of ca lines drops significantly with increasing @xmath13 , we therefore limited our analysis to white dwarfs with @xmath13@xmath67k ( 729 objects ) .",
    "we found a marked difference in the incidence of h in he+z white dwarfs compared to metal - free he white dwarfs which becomes apparent when comparing two ratios :    @xmath68    @xmath69    we find @xmath70 per cent ( the same value found by kk15 for the entire sample with @xmath13@xmath5923000k ) , and @xmath71 per cent .",
    "the standard error for a proportion is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the measured proportion and @xmath74 the number of measurements ( i.e. @xmath75 for @xmath76 , and @xmath77 for @xmath78 ) .",
    "for our two independent samples we obtain @xmath79 and @xmath80 . at face value",
    "this suggests that the measured difference in the fractions of white dwarfs with h is highly significant .",
    "the average s / n for the metal - free sample and the metal polluted sample are 21.0 and 21.6 respectively and , therefore , any bias caused by the detectability of h at different s / n would affect @xmath81 and @xmath82 in similar ways . we also find no significant difference in the temperature distributions of the two samples reinforcing that h should be equally detectable for both groups of stars .",
    "we evaluate the significance of the difference between @xmath81 and @xmath82 by performing the appropriate statistical test for the two independent samples . given the null hypothesis that the two proportions are equal i.e. @xmath83 , we can use our best estimate of the total fraction of systems with h as our best estimate for both samples , i.e. @xmath84 the standard error for the difference of two independent samples is then @xmath85 @xmath86    @xmath87    and the corresponding test statistic @xmath88 is @xmath89 from equation 3 we find @xmath90 implying that we can reject the null hypothesis at a @xmath91 significance level . in other words , under the assumption that h is equally common in metal - polluted he white dwarfs than in metal - free ones , the observed ratios would have less than one in a million chance of occurring . in the primordial h or ism accretion hypothesis",
    ", no correlation should exist between the presence of h and accretion of metals ( in this case ca ) from an external source .",
    "the most likely explanation for what we observe is therefore that a significant fraction of the h detected in he+h+z white dwarfs must have the same origin as the metals , i.e. accretion of planetary debris .",
    "three main theories have been put forward to explain the origin of trace h in he atmosphere white dwarfs : accretion from the ism @xcite , convective mixing of a primordial thin h layer ( @xcite ; kk15 ) and accretion of water - bearing debris @xcite . in their comprehensive analysis of",
    "he white dwarfs @xcite concluded that the primordial h hypothesis can not explain the entire range of @xmath92 observed in he+h white dwarfs , unless a mechanism of non - complete mixing of h in the convective zone is invoked .",
    "they further argued that ism accretion could also provide a plausible explanation , but this would require h accretion to be effective for some he+h white dwarfs , and not for other stars with similar temperatures and cooling ages .",
    "the more recent work by kk15 showed that no correlation could be found between @xmath92 and either height of the white dwarfs above the galactic plane or their cooling ages , which led kk15 to rule out the ism accretion theory and strongly favour the primordial h hypothesis . in the water accretion scenario ,",
    "h is delivered onto the white dwarf ( as water or bound in hydrated minerals ) , together with various metal species as a result of the tidal disruption of asteroids , comets and possibly even planets @xcite .",
    "hydrogen can in principle occur in compounds other than water , for example ammonia ( nh@xmath93 ) and methane ( ch@xmath94 ) which are also common in our solar system . however , solar system bodies which contain these compounds are also known to harbour far larger amounts of water .",
    "furthermore , it has become increasingly clear that most metal - polluted white dwarfs accrete volatile - depleted material , with very low mass fractions of c and seemingly devoid of n @xcite ; with the only noticeable exception of wd1425 + 540 @xcite .",
    "previous studies examining evidence of water accretion onto white dwarfs relied on detection of o in the atmosphere of these objects , a key diagnostic which can be directly related to ongoing or recent accretion of water ( @xcite , see section [ atm_h ] ) . because of the low resolution and limited s / n of the sdss spectra , ca is the only metal detected in most of the he+h+z white dwarfs in the kk15 sample and , in the absence of o detections , no direct proof of ongoing or recent water accretion is possible",
    ". however , h never diffuses out of the atmosphere of white dwarfs and could therefore be a lasting record of water accretion long after all metals have diffused out . for individual white dwarfs it is not possible to claim that the currently observable metal pollution and the trace h result from the accretion of the same body , but the presence of metals undeniably shows that the star hosts a planetary system and is accreting rocky remnants .",
    "looking at the population of he atmosphere white dwarfs , we showed that the incidence of h is strongly correlated with the presence of metals ( section [ incidence ] ) .",
    "we demonstrated that white dwarfs which host rocky planetary systems are statistically much more likely to have trace h compared to metal - free white dwarfs .",
    "we therefore propose that the majority of he+h+z white dwarfs are likely to have accreted at least some fraction of their @xmath95 , at some point during their cooling age , in the form of water or hydrated minerals in rocky planetesimal ( e.g. as detected in gd61 , @xcite ) , or comets @xcite .",
    "@xcite quantitatively estimated the mass fraction of water in the debris accreted by white dwarfs , by comparing the summed mass accretion rates of heavy elements with that of h in a volume - limited sample of he white dwarfs .",
    "@xcite concluded that , on average both across the sample and over time , water makes up less than one per cent of the mass of the material accreted by white dwarfs . assuming all h in the atmosphere of the he+h+z white dwarfs in the kk15 sample is the result of water accretion , the upper limit of accreted water mass for these stars ranges between @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "adopting the same statistical approach used by @xcite , on average , these masses only correspond to @xmath98 per cent of the mass of metals accreted by these stars .",
    "therefore our analysis supports that of @xcite .",
    "one limitation of the analysis presented by @xcite is that their sample was limited to white dwarfs with cooling ages @xmath99yr .",
    "water accretion is most likely not a continuous event : while large amounts of h may be accumulated at once as the result of the tidal disruption of one large water - rich planetesimal in the solar system ( e.g. ceres ) , multiple accretion events of small bodies ( e.g. small asteroids and comets , @xcite ) can gradually contribute to the h mass over the entire cooling age of the white dwarfs .",
    "this naturally explains why the outliers with the highest @xmath95 are all relatively cool and old white dwarfs .",
    "applying the analysis of @xcite only to the small sample of cool @xmath95 outliers , i.e. gd16 , gd17 , gd362 , pg1225@xmath5079 and sdssj1242 + 5226 ( tables[gd16_abb],[gd16_mass ] ) , we find that , on average , the water - to - metal mass fraction in these stars is @xmath100 per cent .",
    "of course applying this type of analysis to only five stars can only provide a weakly constrained upper limit .",
    "nonetheless the water - to - metal mass fraction found is much higher than the @xmath101 per cent we calculate for the kk15 sample and from the one per cent found by @xcite , which underlines once more the peculiar nature of these white dwarfs . assuming that these five stars accreted h at some point during their cooling age ( like we showed is a likely scenario for most he+h+z white dwarfs ) , some detail of their accretion history must set them apart from the rest of the white dwarfs in the sample .",
    "it is possible that these stars hosted particularly water - rich planetary systems , which , in turn , would also explain why only a handful of these outliers have been discovered to date .",
    "assuming @xmath95 has a planetary origin , these stars accreted up to @xmath102 of water , a mass close to the upper limit of the total water content of earth ( estimated to be between 0.06 and 2 per cent by mass , @xcite ) .",
    "accretion of the entire @xmath95 in a single event would imply large and very water rich parent bodies , i.e. entire planets or moons ejected from their orbits @xcite .",
    "these peculiar white dwarfs are older than the majority of the other stars examined by both kk15 and @xcite , so , alternatively , their large atmospheric h content could potentially be the result of slow accumulation over their long cooling ages . in this case",
    "we would expect more of these h - rich he atmosphere white dwarfs particularly at low temperatures .",
    "however once metals have completely diffused out of their atmospheres , the spectrum of these stars would only show h absorption and these white dwarfs could easily not be recognised . on the other hand , to date , hundreds of metal polluted white dwarfs with @xmath13@xmath103k ( dzs ) are known , the vast majority of which have , at most , only minor amounts of h in their atmospheres @xcite .",
    "independently of the specific delivery scenario we propose that gd16 , gd17 and by analogy gd362 , pg1225@xmath5079 and sdssj1242 + 5226 likely owe at least part of their exceptional h content to accretion of water - bearing debris over their cooling age .",
    "to date four he - atmosphere white dwarfs are known to have exceptionally high amounts of h in their atmosphere , all of which also show significant metal pollution .",
    "here we reported the discovery of a new member of this group , the white dwarf gd17 and compared it with the archetypal example of the class , gd16 .",
    "our analysis of newly acquired spectroscopy of gd16 and gd17 revealed that the h contents in the atmosphere of these stars are some of the highest measured among all he atmosphere white dwarfs . unlike metal pollutants h never diffuses out of the atmosphere of a white dwarf and can therefore be a lasting tracer of water accretion .",
    "independently of their specific accretion history we conclude that gd16 , gd17 and by analogy the other stars in this class ( i.e. gd362 , pg1225@xmath5079 and sdssj1242 + 5226 ) likely owe at least part of their exceptional h content to accretion of water - bearing debris .",
    "we investigated the idea of h delivery via accretion of water - bearing debris by comparing the incidence of h in he and he+z white dwarfs from the sample analysed by @xcite .",
    "we rejected with @xmath91 significance the hypothesis that h is equally common in he and he+z white dwarfs , and find that trace h is present in 61 per cent of the metal polluted white dwarfs in our sample and in only 32 per cent of the metal - free ones .",
    "our analysis indicates that accretion of water - bearing bodies likely represents a significant contribution for the h content of he+h white dwarfs and , though rare compared to dry material , some amount of water must be present in most planetary systems which harbour rocky bodies .",
    "the research leading to these results has received funding from the european research council under the european union s seventh framework programme ( fp/2007 - 2013 ) / erc grant agreement n. 320964 ( wdtracer ) . based on observations made with eso telescopes at the paranal observatory under programme",
