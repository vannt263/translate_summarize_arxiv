    "in this paper , we study homeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms of one - manifolds , i.e. , @xmath9 $ ] , or @xmath10 . for convenience , we will always assume they are orientation - preserving .",
    "from a dynamical standpoint , a homeomorphism of the line is not very interesting .",
    "it will have some closed ( possibly empty ) set of fixed points , on the complement of which points wander to the left or to the right .",
    "the dynamics of a homeomorphism of the circle _ is _ interesting ; this theory is due to poincar .",
    "he defined a quantity called the _ rotation number _ @xmath11 of a homeomorphism @xmath12 , and showed that this quantity contains valuable dynamical information about @xmath12 .",
    "namely , if @xmath13 is zero ( rational ) , @xmath12 has fixed ( periodic ) points . on the other hand , if @xmath13 is irrational , @xmath12 is topologically semi - conjugate to a rotation of the circle by the angle @xmath13 . in this situation",
    "there are two sub - possibilities : ( 1 ) @xmath12 is in fact conjugate to a rotation , so its dynamics is minimal ( every orbit is dense ) , or ( 2 ) there is a cantor set on which @xmath12 is minimal , the complement of which consists of `` wandering intervals '' that never return to themselves .",
    "see @xcite for more information .",
    "a homeomorphism of a manifold @xmath0 can be viewed as giving an action of @xmath14 on @xmath0 , via @xmath15 . in this light , it is natural to consider actions of other groups , such as abelian groups , or more generally nilpotent groups .",
    "formally , by an _ action _ of @xmath1 on @xmath0 we mean a homomorphism @xmath16 , the group of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of @xmath0 .",
    "( we deal only with discrete groups in this paper , so continuity of @xmath17 is not an issue . )",
    "we say the action is _ faithful _ if @xmath17 is one - to - one .    for example , one can get faithful @xmath18 actions on @xmath10 ( resp .",
    "@xmath19 ) by taking @xmath20 rationally independent rotations ( resp .",
    "translations ) .",
    "notice that these actions will be minimal for any @xmath21 on @xmath10 , and for any @xmath22 on @xmath19 .",
    "there is a close interplay between group actions on the circle and on the line .",
    "first , given an abelian action on the circle with a _ global fixed point _ ( point fixed by the whole group ) , one can remove the fixed point , and what remains is an action on the line .",
    "conversely , given an action on @xmath19 we can add a point at infinity to get an action on @xmath10 .    more interestingly ,",
    "suppose we are given @xmath20 commuting homeomorphisms @xmath23 of the line .",
    "it turns out that if there are no global fixed points for the action of @xmath23 , then some @xmath24 must have no fixed points .",
    "we can quotient @xmath19 by the action of @xmath24 , yielding a circle .",
    "since the other homeomorphisms commute with @xmath24 , they induce homeomorphisms @xmath25 of the quotient circle @xmath26 .",
    "thus , an action of @xmath18 on @xmath19 with no global fixed points yields an action of @xmath27 on @xmath10 .",
    "the converse is also true : given an action of @xmath27 on @xmath28 , we can lift it to a group of @xmath29 homeomorphisms of @xmath19 commuting with translation by one , giving a @xmath18 action on @xmath19 .",
    "it is a folklore theorem that any finitely - generated torsion - free nilpotent group admits faithful actions by homeomorphisms of the line ( and hence also the circle ) .",
    "this is equivalent to the fact that such a group admits left - invariant total orders @xcite .",
    "explicitly , following farb and franks we can construct actions of these groups as follows .",
    "malcev s work @xcite ( see also @xcite ) shows that every finitely - generated torsion - free nilpotent group @xmath1 embeds in some @xmath30 .",
    "thus , to define an action of @xmath1 by homeomorphisms of the line , we need only define an action of @xmath31 .",
    "we take lower - triangular matrices because they are convenient in the following way : the standard action of @xmath31 on @xmath18 ( on the left ) preserves the lexicographic order on @xmath18 .",
    "it is possible to choose a collection of disjoint open subintervals of @xmath19 with dense union in @xmath19 , indexed by @xmath18 and with the property that @xmath32 is to the left of @xmath33 if and only if @xmath34 in the lexicographic order .",
    "we can define an action of @xmath31 on @xmath35 by letting @xmath36",
    "send @xmath37 to @xmath38 , say in an affine way .",
    "since we chose the @xmath37 to have dense union in @xmath19 , these maps extend uniquely to homeomorphisms of the line .    in the examples of nilpotent actions we have seen so far ,",
    "there have been two basic types of behavior .",
    "one is minimality , as in at least one irrational rotation of the circle or at least two independent translations of the line .",
    "the other is discrete intervals with dense union being permuted in some way .",
    "this was the case for the general construction of nilpotent actions we gave , and the reader can check it also holds for any single homeomorphism of a one - manifold not conjugate to an irrational rotation of the circle .",
    "our main result says that these two behaviors , in some combination , are all we can see for nilpotent actions on one - manifolds .",
    "theoremstructuretheorem [ structuretheorem ]",
    "let @xmath0 be a one - manifold , and @xmath39 be a finitely - generated virtually nilpotent group .",
    "there exist ( countably many ) open sets @xmath40 and @xmath41 such that the following hold :    * @xmath42 unless @xmath43 , and @xmath44 for all @xmath45 . *",
    "each @xmath40 and @xmath41 is @xmath1-invariant .",
    "* let @xmath3 be the open intervals comprising @xmath40 .",
    "for any @xmath46 , there exists @xmath47 such that @xmath48 . if @xmath49 , then @xmath50 . * for any @xmath51 , the action of @xmath1 on @xmath41 is minimal . if @xmath52 and the action of @xmath1 on @xmath10 is minimal , @xmath1 is abelian .",
    "if some @xmath41 is composed of open intervals @xmath4 then the group @xmath53 is abelian .",
    "* @xmath54 is dense .    in figure 1 , we show an example of what this could look like for an action of the heisenberg group @xmath55 = h \\text { and } [ f , h ] = [ g , h ] = id\\rangle$ ] on @xmath19 .",
    "the action of @xmath12 is by translation , as shown .",
    "the elements @xmath56 and @xmath57 act minimally on the wavy intervals , while in the other intervals , @xmath57 acts trivially and a @xmath56-orbit is depicted . for this action , there is only one @xmath58 and only one @xmath59 , as shown .",
    "note that the action of @xmath60 on @xmath59 is _ not _ abelian , but its restriction to any of the intervals in @xmath59 is .",
    "there two key nontrivial assertions in our theorem , which depend on fact that finitely - generated virtually nilpotent groups have polynomial _ growth _ ( see below for the definition ) .",
    "the first is that , on a @xmath1-invariant interval on which the action is minimal , the action is abelian .",
    "this assertion holds for any finitely - generated group of sub - exponential growth .",
    "however , it is not true for solvable groups . for instance , consider the group of homeomorphisms of @xmath19 generated by @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this action is minimal : the orbit of @xmath63 contains every dyadic rational . but clearly , the group is not abelian .",
    "the second nontrivial assertion is that , in regions where the action is not minimal , there are no dense orbits .",
    "this fails in general for groups not having polynomial growth .",
    "grigorchuk - maki gave an example of a group @xmath1 of intermediate ( super - polynomial , sub - exponential ) growth acting faithfully by homeomorphisms of the line .",
    "this group action has dense orbits , but also has ( a dense set of ) orbits that are not dense .",
    "we show three of these orbits in figure 2 .",
    "all the dots of a given size lie in the same orbit ; for clarity , we have shown only part of the densest orbit .            this second assertion is proved for finitely - generated virtually nilpotent groups by an inductive procedure , looking at finer and finer intervals .",
    "the procedure must end after finitely many steps , since these groups have polynomial growth , and each time we restrict to a finer interval the growth degree becomes smaller .",
    "the inductive procedure yielding the desired intervals is a conjugacy invariant : if we have two topologically conjugate actions of a finitely - generated virtually nilpotent group @xmath1 , then the structure of the intervals we get will agree .",
    "we have the following immediate corollary :    let @xmath0 be a 1-manifold , and @xmath1 a",
    "finitely - generated virtually nilpotent group .",
    "two actions @xmath64 are conjugate if and only if there is a homeomorphism of @xmath0 sending @xmath65 and @xmath66 to @xmath67 and @xmath68 and intertwining the @xmath17 and @xmath69 actions of @xmath1 on these intervals .",
    "in particular , the action of @xmath1 on @xmath66 by @xmath17 and the action of @xmath1 on @xmath68 by @xmath69 are conjugate groups of translations whose elements must have the same translation numbers relative to each other .",
    "let @xmath0 be a manifold , and @xmath71 a homeomorphism .",
    "it is natural to ask , what is the smoothest diffeomorphism of @xmath0 topologically conjugate to @xmath12 ? on surfaces , it is easy to construct homeomorphisms not conjugate to @xmath5 diffeomorphisms .",
    "for example , let @xmath12 have a fixed point @xmath72 , and rotate points faster and faster as one approaches @xmath72 , with the amount of rotation tending to infinity .",
    "no matter what conjugacy one applies , there will still be a `` bad '' point with infinitely fast rotation , so the result will not be a @xmath5 diffeomorphism .",
    "in fact , harrison @xcite has shown the following : on any @xmath20-manifold ( @xmath73 or @xmath74 ) , there exist",
    "@xmath75 diffeomorphisms not conjugate to @xmath76 diffeomorphisms for any real numbers @xmath77 ( if these are not integers , the fractional parts are interpreted as hlder exponents ) .",
    "she shows moreover that if @xmath0 is compact , such _",
    "unsmoothable _ diffeomorphisms are dense in @xmath78 in the @xmath70 topology .    in dimension one",
    "the possibilities for dynamics , and correspondingly for unsmoothability , are much more limited .",
    "the line @xmath19 is particularly simple : as we have seen , a homeomorphism @xmath79 is characterized by its set of fixed points and the direction points in @xmath80 move .",
    "one can easily check , using this , that any homeomorphism of @xmath19 is topologically conjugate to a @xmath81 diffeomorphism ; one simply needs to use gentle enough `` bump functions '' in the intervals of @xmath80 .",
    "the circle @xmath10 is not quite so simple , since there can be nontrivial recurrence . from the point of view of smoothability",
    ", there are two possibilities .",
    "the first is that the homeomorphism @xmath82 either has rational rotation number or is conjugate to an irrational rotation . in this case",
    ", @xmath12 is conjugate to a @xmath81 diffeomorphism of @xmath10 .",
    "the second is that @xmath12 is semi - conjugate , but not conjugate , to an irrational rotation ( i.e. , it has an exceptional minimal set ) . in this case , by the following theorem of denjoy , @xmath12 can not be topologically conjugated to @xmath83 :    if @xmath82 is a @xmath83 diffeomorphism with irrational rotation number @xmath84 , then @xmath12 is topologically conjugate to the rotation @xmath85 .    in this paper",
    ", we show that a homeomorphism of the second type is still always conjugate to a @xmath6 diffeomorphism for any @xmath86 .",
    "thus there is a threshold of regularity for circle diffeomorphisms ; one class of diffeomorphisms can be smoothed only up to this threshold , while the other can be smoothed past it .",
    "more generally , we prove the following , with the help of theorem [ structuretheorem ] :    [ smoothability ] let @xmath0 be a 1-manifold , and let @xmath39 be a finitely - generated , virtually nilpotent subgroup .",
    "then there exists a homeomorphism @xmath87 such that @xmath88 for any @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the degree of polynomial growth of @xmath1 .",
    "this result strengthens the following theorem of farb and franks :    let @xmath0 be a 1-manifold . every finitely - generated , torsion - free nilpotent group is isomorphic to a subgroup of @xmath91 .",
    "farb and franks s theorem says that for finitely - generated torsion - free nilpotent groups there _ exist _ faithful actions ; our theorem says that _ every _ action can be conjugated to @xmath5 ( and a little more ) .",
    "the following comes easily from our theorem :    [ corollary ] let @xmath92 be finitely - generated and virtually nilpotent . given any fixed generating set for @xmath1 , it is possible to conjugate @xmath1 to a subgroup of @xmath93 such that the generators are as @xmath5 close to rotations as desired .",
    "the same is true for @xmath94 , with `` rotations '' replaced by `` the identity . ''",
    "this gives another method for proving theorem b from @xcite .      in this section",
    ", we explore the extent to which our theorem is sharp .",
    "we first observe that we can not in general conjugate the group action to @xmath95 , even if @xmath96 .",
    "to see this , take a homeomorphism @xmath12 of the circle with exceptional minimal set .",
    "lift @xmath12 to a homeomorphism @xmath97 commuting with translation by 1 , @xmath98 .",
    "the group generated by @xmath99 and @xmath98 can not be conjugated to @xmath95 .",
    "next , we note that our theorem can not be strengthened to include the class of solvable groups .",
    "it is shown in and that there exist actions of the baumslag - solitar group @xmath100 on @xmath10 which can not be conjugated to @xmath5 .",
    "this example makes use of the fact that @xmath101 is exponentially distorted ( see below ) in @xmath102 .",
    "bonatti , monteverde , navas , and rivas @xcite give a large class of solvable examples ( including this one ) that can not be conjugated to @xmath5 .    by gromov",
    "s theorem @xcite , our results apply to any group of polynomial growth",
    ". it would be interesting to understand actions of groups with sub - exponential growth .",
    "in particular , it seems natural to ask :    is the grigorchuk - maki group action on the line conjugate to a @xmath5 action ?",
    "navas @xcite has shown that it is _ semi - conjugate _ to a @xmath5 action : by adding `` buffer '' regions on which the action is trivial , he constructs a faithful @xmath5 action of this group .",
    "another necessary assumption in our results is finite generation of the group .",
    "it is easy to construct uncountable abelian groups of homeomorphisms of @xmath19 which are not conjugate to lipschitz , let alone @xmath5 . on the other hand",
    ", a remarkable result of deroin , kleptsyn , and navas @xcite says that any countable group of homeomorphisms in dimension one is conjugate to a group of bi - lipschitz homeomorphisms .",
    "this leads us to the following question :    if @xmath0 is a 1-manifold , and @xmath39 is a countable nilpotent ( or even abelian ) subgroup , is @xmath1 conjugate to a subgroup of @xmath91 ?",
    "a final line of questions involves the optimal regularity for finitely - generated nilpotent actions .",
    "we show in this paper that any finitely - generated virtually nilpotent subgroup @xmath39 is conjugate to a subgroup of @xmath103 for any @xmath104 less than the degree of polynomial growth of @xmath1 .",
    "this leaves open the following questions ( the first one due to navas ) :    for a finitely - generated virtually nilpotent group @xmath1 , what is the smoothest faithful action of @xmath1 on [ 0 , 1 ] ? what is the least smoothable action ?",
    "let @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) be the group of @xmath107 upper - triangular matrices with 1s on the diagonal .",
    "farb and franks exhibited a @xmath5 action of this group on @xmath108 $ ] ; castro , jorquera , and navas @xcite showed that this action can be smoothed to any differentiability class less than @xmath109 ( and subsequently navas @xcite showed @xmath109 is not possible ) .",
    "note that the group @xmath105 has growth degree @xmath110 , so @xmath111 .",
    "thus , for these groups one can always achieve greater smoothness than our results suggest .",
    "in fact , jorquera @xcite showed that there exist groups of arbitrarily high nilpotence degree that embed in @xmath112)$ ] for any @xmath86 .",
    "* acknowledgments .",
    "* i would like to thank andrs navas for referring me to several important articles , including the one of cantwell - conlon and the one of guelman - liousse , for pointing out corollary [ corollary ] and its relation to his article @xcite , and for his enthusiasm for this research .",

    "i am grateful for the support of uri shapira and a fellowship at the technion from the lady davis foundation .",
    "the next two results are involved in showing that , for nilpotent group actions , minimal implies abelian .",
    "the following proposition is easy .",

    "the reader can check , with the interval lengths as we have defined them , together with equation ( 1 ) , that we do get a uniform bound on the @xmath222 norm of @xmath316 on @xmath3 .",

    "this is because whenever @xmath338 or @xmath339 is large we will have @xmath340 and @xmath341 .",
    "obviously , the sine and cosine functions in the numerator have magnitude at most 1 , so we only need to consider their coefficients as we vary @xmath51 and @xmath280 , these being ( disregarding a factor of @xmath342 ) @xmath343 and @xmath344 . we claim that there exists a constant @xmath290 such that these are both bounded above by @xmath345 for all @xmath45 .              as before , for large @xmath338 or @xmath339 , @xmath358 is close to 1 , so we can disregard it .",
