    "if nature is supersymmetric at the tev scale , the weakness of gravity can be naturally understood and a highly successful prediction for the weak mixing angle results . for well over 20 years , theorists have examined the possible forms of supersymmetric electroweak theories , and experimentalists have pondered how superpartners may be discovered .",
    "although we talk of a minimal supersymmetric standard model , the mssm , it is not clear that this model is preferred over others .",
    "below we examine the stages required to supersymmetrize the known gauge interactions , and argue for a new simple phenomenological framework .",
    "the first stage is to place the known elementary particles into multiplets of supersymmetry .",
    "the quarks and leptons of the standard model @xmath10 are placed in chiral multiplets @xmath11 , implying that spin zero squarks and sleptons are expected at the weak scale , while the @xmath12 and electroweak gauge bosons are placed in vector multiplets of supersymmetry , leading to spin 1/2 gluinos , winos and photinos .",
    "the next stage is to supersymmetrize the higgs boson of the standard model .",
    "if it is placed in a single chiral multiplet , the corresponding higgsino leads to gauge anomalies , and this single higgs multiplet is not able to give masses to both the up quarks and the down quarks .",
    "the minimal possibility is two higgs chiral multiplets @xmath13 .",
    "the quark and lepton interactions with the higgs are described by the superpotential @xmath14 the supersymmetric interactions contain both yukawa couplings between the fermions and scalars , and quartic interactions between the scalars .",
    "similarly , the supersymmetric gauge interactions involve yukawa and quartic type interactions , but no new parameters are needed beyond those of the standard model .",
    "few would doubt that any supersymmetric electroweak theory in 4 dimensions must contain this minimal set of interactions .",
    "the real question is : what else is needed ?",
    "the most glaring omission is the breaking of supersymmetry .",
    "it is possible to remain agnostic about the fundamental origin of supersymmetry breaking : one can simply assume that in the tev scale effective theory the breaking is described by a set of operators that do not spoil the controlled radiative behaviour of supersymmetric theories @xcite .",
    "in practice this means that gaugino masses and scalar mass terms can be added by hand , together with a certain set of bilinear and trilinear scalar interactions , one for each term in the superpotential .",
    "one can leave the origin of these `` soft '' operators to the future .",
    "although this sounds like a cheat , from the viewpoint of phenomenology at the electroweak scale it certainly is nt : the effective theory allows for the most general possible case , and hence provides the ideal tool for testing the idea of weak scale supersymmetry , without needing to know anything about the origin of supersymmetry breaking at shorter distances .",
    "supersymmetry breaking can trigger electroweak symmetry breaking as a heavy top quark effect : the large top quark yukawa coupling provides a controlled , negative radiative correction to the mass squared parameter for the higgs boson @xmath15 .",
    "the theory as it stands has a physical higgs boson mass that is lighter than the mass of the @xmath16 boson in tree approximation .",
    "this is not necessarily a problem , since radiative corrections to the higgs mass from the top squark may be large .",
    "the basic supersymmetrization described above , with the superpotential of ( [ eq : w ] ) can not be the whole story , since it has three very clear conflicts with data .",
    "* the only unknown parameters of the higgs potential are the two soft mass squared parameters , @xmath17 . there are no values for these parameters that lead to stable , non - zero vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) for both higgs doublets , as is required to give masses to all the quarks and charged leptons .",
    "even if this problem is solved , the theory possesses two particles which are clearly experimentally excluded .    *",
    "the interactions of ( [ eq : w ] ) are invariant under a global peccei ",
    "quinn symmetry @xcite , that is spontaneously broken by the vevs of @xmath18 leading to an electroweak axion @xcite .",
    "this axion is excluded , for example by k meson decays and astrophysics .",
    "* the theory possesses two integrally charged dirac fermions : the charginos . in the limit that the two higgs vevs are equal and the supersymmetry breaking gaugino mass terms",
    "are ignored these two fermions are degenerate and have a mass @xmath19 . allowing the vevs to differ and",
    "introducing gaugino mass terms removes the degeneracy , so that one of the charginos becomes heavier than @xmath19 and the other lighter .",
    "radiative corrections are small , and this light chargino is excluded by the lep experiments .",
    "is it possible to be agnostic about how these two particles get heavy ? can we study an effective field theory where we simply add by hand an axion mass and a mass for the light chargino ?",
    "the situation would then be very similar to supersymmetry breaking , and we could postpone worrying about the origin of such masses . for the chargino the answer is no : such a mass term breaks supersymmetry in a way that damages the radiative structure of the theory .",
    "one must address the origin of the light chargino mass via fully supersymmetric interactions at the weak scale .",
    "however , for the axion mass the answer is yes : experiment requires only a small axion mass , and a small axion mass can be added without doing violence to the theory .",
    "it is this observation that leads us to a new framework for weak scale supersymmetry .",
    "explicit breaking of the peccei ",
    "quinn symmetry may originate from scales far above the electroweak scale , even at the planck scale , or it may occur very weakly at the tev scale . either way , we need not address this physics to pursue the phenomenology of supersymmetry at the electroweak scale . a small soft breaking of peccei ",
    "quinn symmetry is analogous to soft breaking of supersymmetry .",
    "as far as the weak scale effective theory is concerned , the only consequence is the appearance of an axion mass .    in section",
    "ii we present the theoretical framework that incorporates this idea , and compare it to standard supersymmetric electroweak theories . in section iii the higgs potential is studied and a vacuum is found where a @xmath0 parameter of order the supersymmetry breaking scale is geneerated  a result obtained earlier by ciafaloni and pomarol @xcite .",
    "the scalar and fermion spectrum of the higgs sector is also discussed .",
    "limits on our theory from lep experiments , other terrestrial experiments and from astrophysical observations are studied in sections iv , v and vi , respectively .",
    "cosmological signals from bbn and cmb eras are discussed in section vii , as well as lsp dark matter . in section viii",
    "we discuss signatures at future colliders and draw conclusions in section ix .",
    "the basic supersymmetrization discussed above is very economical .",
    "the supersymmetric gauge interactions and the supersymmetric yukawa interactions of ( [ eq : w ] ) involve the same number of parameters as their non - supersymmetric counterparts in the standard model .",
    "supersymmetry breaking is described in a phenomenological way by adding the most general set of soft operators : gaugino masses , scalar masses and a trilinear scalar interactions for each term in ( [ eq : w ] ) .",
    "these @xmath20 terms , and the gaugino masses , imply that the theory has no @xmath21 symmetry , but there are other global symmetries .",
    "there are 7 chiral multiplets of differing form and ( [ eq : w ] ) possesses 3 interactions , so the theory possesses 4 flavour symmetric @xmath22 symmetries : gauged hypercharge , together with the global baryon number , @xmath23 , lepton number , @xmath24 , and peccei  quinn , @xmath25 , symmetries .",
    "indeed , given the field content , the basic supersymmetrization is the most general softly broken supersymmetric theory with these symmetries .",
    "the mssm provides an economical solution to the three problems , discussed in the introduction , of the basic supersymmetrization .",
    "no new fields are added , but the most general set of @xmath25 breaking interactions are added @xmath26 together with the soft supersymmetry breaking interaction @xmath27 the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath23 are real , and we have chosen to write the physical phase in the superpotential so that the scalar potential is real .",
    "all three problems are solved : the soft mass term allows a stable vacuum with both vevs non - zero , the chargino mass is proportional to @xmath0 and the axion mass is proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "however , the parameter @xmath0 introduces its own problem .",
    "the whole idea of having supersymmetry at the weak scale is to trigger electroweak symmetry breaking from supersymmetry breaking . but @xmath0 gives the higgs bosons a supersymmetric mass . since @xmath0 is allowed by the symmetries of the theory , what stops it from being huge ?",
    "why should it have anything to do with the mass parameters appearing in the supersymmetry breaking interactions ?",
    "in certain theories it is possible to understand that @xmath0 is itself triggered by supersymmetry breaking , and the fact that it happens to be supersymmetric is essentially accidental @xcite .",
    "however , this applies to a restricted set of theories of supersymmetry breaking , and in general the mystery of why @xmath0 is comparable in size to the soft parameters is a failing of the mssm .",
    "the obvious solution to the @xmath0 problem is to promote @xmath0 to a chiral superfield , @xmath2 , which is a singlet under the known gauge interactions .",
    "the desired mass parameter then results when supersymmetry breaking triggers @xmath2 to have a vev of order the supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "the immediate problem is that this reintroduces an electroweak axion . to give the axion a mass a second supersymmetric interaction",
    "is needed , so that the next - to - minimal model ( nmssm ) is described by the superpotential @xmath28 and the soft operators @xmath29 which together contain 7 real parameters .",
    "this theory is also completely realistic : there is a stable electroweak symmetry breaking vacuum with the chargino mass deriving from the @xmath30 interaction and the axion mass from the @xmath31 interaction .",
    "however , the parameter space of this theory is significantly larger than that of the mssm  it is not even possible to remove phases from the higgs potential .",
    "we construct a theory where the @xmath0 parameter is again promoted to a singlet chiral superfield @xmath2 , but introduce an alternative symmetry structure . at the weak scale the u(1 )",
    "pq symmetry is only an approximate symmetry , with small explicit breaking in addition to that from the qcd anomaly .",
    "this explicit breaking could arise at some high mass scale , @xmath32 , much larger than the weak interaction scale @xmath33 , such that the renormalizable interactions below @xmath32 , both supersymmetric and supersymmetry breaking , possess u(1 ) pq symmetry as an accidental symmetry of the low energy theory .",
    "the renormalizable superpotential is then the most general allowed by the pq symmetry , so that the operators @xmath34 are all forbidden .",
    "all pq breaking is suppressed by inverse powers of the large mass scale @xmath32 .",
    "alternatively , the pq breaking could arise as a very small effect in the renormalizable interactions , such as @xmath35 or @xmath31 . either way",
    ", we assume that at the weak scale the explicit pq symmetry breaking is small enough that its only relevance to data is to give a mass to the axion .",
    "the resulting theory is described by the superpotential @xmath36 together with the soft operators @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mass squared of the pseudo - goldstone boson @xmath3 , and is taken positive and much smaller than the scale of supersymmetry breaking , and without loss of generality @xmath39 and @xmath40 are taken real . in the limit that @xmath41 , @xmath3 becomes the axion and laboratory data and astrophysical constraints require that the axion decay constant , and therefore the @xmath42 vev , be larger than @xmath43 gev . for the higgs doublets to be at the weak scale",
    "we need @xmath44 : we recover the mssm with the @xmath0 problem . in our theory",
    "we take @xmath45 kev , so that the laboratory and astrophysical constraints are avoided .",
    "this mass is large enough that the strong cp problem is not solved , so we do not refer to @xmath3 as the axion .",
    "the superpotential ( [ eq : deltaw ] ) , with @xmath0 parameter promoted to a dynamical field , was studied by ciafaloni ",
    "pomarol @xcite .",
    "they were motivated by the twin problems of the @xmath0 problem and the doublet ",
    "triplet splitting of grand unified theories .",
    "in addition to @xmath46 , our theory has 5 parameters in the electroweak sector ( those in ( [ eq : deltaw ] , [ eq : deltav ] ) ) , which is intermediate between the mssm ( the 3 parameters of ( [ eq : wmssm ] , [ eq : vmssm ] ) ) and the nmssm ( the 7 parameters of ( [ eq : wnmssm ] , [ eq : vnmssm ] ) ) .",
    "however , one of our parameters , @xmath4 , is small and does not enter into the physics of neutralinos or charginos .",
    "for electroweak symmetry breaking we only have 4 parameters .",
    "in fact , in this paper we study the case that @xmath47 is also irrelevantly small , since this gives the desired potential minimization , reducing our parameters to 3  the same as the mssm . although we do not pursue it in this paper , a further reduction in the parameter space of our theory",
    "is possible .",
    "if we assume universality of the trilinear @xmath20 parameters , then the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath48 are not new but are the same as parameters already introduced in the basic supersymmetrization .",
    "this is not true of the @xmath23 and @xmath49 parameters of the mssm , since the interaction is bilinear not trilinear . in this case ,",
    "our theory possesses a single new parameter for electroweak symmetry breaking , beyond those of the basic supersymmetrization .",
    "there are many models that lead to our framework at the electroweak scale , and hence to the phenomenology discussed later .",
    "although we remain agnostic about the physics that leads to @xmath4 in later sections , it may be useful to give explicit examples here .",
    "the continuous u(1 ) pq symmetry may be absent at high energies and appear as an accidental symmetry of the renormalizable interactions , just as in the case of lepton number symmetry . consider the most general superpotential under a @xmath50 symmetry and @xmath51 @xmath21 symmetry , with superfield charges shown in table  [ tab : pqrcharge ] .",

    "the u(1 ) pq symmetry appears because of the absence of @xmath55 operators in the superpotential , and is broken by the dimension 5 operator @xmath56_f$ ] and a soft supersymmetry breaking interaction @xmath57 , where @xmath32 is a large mass scale .",
    "these explicit breaking operators give rise to the mass of the pseudo - goldstone boson .",

    "we will later find that @xmath62 is significantly larger than @xmath33 , so that @xmath4 originates dominantly from the supersymmetry breaking operator @xmath63 : m_g 10 .",
    "[ eq : mglim ] thus , @xmath4 is expected to be heavy enough to satisfy laboratory and astrophysical constraints , when the global pq symmetry is broken at the planck scale .",
    "the other class of examples that falls into our effective theory has a u(1 ) pq symmetry at high energies that is weakly broken .",

    "a realistic mass for the goldstone boson can be obtained , while other corrections to the scalar potential are negligable .",

    "we choose to focus on the latter case , since it will allow us to study the maximum possible range of @xmath4 . for @xmath98 mev , the constraint from @xmath99 decays requires @xmath100 tev , or @xmath101 .",

    "in fact , small @xmath39 by itself is not sufficient : if @xmath103 is of order @xmath66 , then @xmath107 becomes large and @xmath108 becomes small .",

    "an initial condition with small @xmath109 can be set by e.g. , gauge mediation @xcite , or possibly by gaugino mediation , and hence we consider that this is quite a plausible assumption .    in this limit",

    "the conditions on the parameters of the theory for successful electroweak symmetry breaking are the following : from ( [ eq : approxbeta ] ) and ( [ eq : approxmz ] ) , @xmath117 given the vev of @xmath42 ( [ eq : approxvs ] ) , the minimization equations ( [ eq : min - h1 ] , [ eq : min - h2 ] ) do not have a solution if the inequalities ( [ eq : ewsbconda ] ) are not satisfied .",

    "if this region is found to be allowed , then we note that the cosmological bound ( [ eq : sinonumber ] ) is close to being saturated .",
    "hence it may be that the @xmath403 is first diluted by a very large amount , and then brought back to an appropriate order by the @xmath388 process .",

    "quinn symmetry is spontaneously broken , and global cosmic strings are formed .",
    "but the energy density of the strings is very small , and there is no significant impact on the density perturbation .",
    "as the temperature drops further , the mass of the goldstone boson becomes important , and domain walls bounded by strings are formed . if there is only one vacuum , the walls and strings shrink and eventually vanish .",
    "otherwise , the energy density of the walls dominates the universe , and causes a cosmological problem .",
    "the number of vacua depends on how the mass of the goldstone boson is generated .",
    "since we assume that the mass is due to explicit breaking of the symmetry at high - energy scale , domain walls are not a problem of the low - energy effective theory , but are an issue for model building at high energy .    in case the mass of the goldstone boson is due to the dimension-5 operator @xmath56_f$ ] , the @xmath50 pq symmetry is spontaneously broken , and there are four distinct vacua . however , the mod 4 pq symmetry is not an exact symmetry , but is broken by the qcd anomaly , and hence the four vacua are not degenerate .",

    "from an experimental point of view , our theory differs from the mssm in two important ways .",
    "firstly the @xmath0 parameter is not a free parameter , but is determined by the pseudoscalar mass @xmath201 and @xmath95 ( [ eq : mupred ] ) . secondly , there are light states @xmath420 that lie dominantly in the singlet superfield , @xmath2 , and have interactions proportional to the small coupling @xmath39 .",
    "these small couplings imply that the rates for direct production of these states at colliders will be very small .",
    "hence only the superpartners and higgs states of the mssm will be directly produced , and furthermore , for any given point in parameter space , the production rates will be identical to those of the mssm .",
    "of course the point in parameter space is now constrained by the prediction for @xmath0 .",
    "the question then becomes : do the cascade decays of superpartners and higgs bosons lead to different signals in our theory compared to the mssm ?    if @xmath147 is as small as @xmath421 , then the scalar states @xmath3 and @xmath162 are unlikely to be produced in the cascade decays sufficiently often to yield an observable signal . for example , the decay rate of @xmath422 is suppressed by @xmath215 , and is generically smaller than that of @xmath423 .",

    "thus , @xmath426 are emitted only through the decay of the nlsp .",
    "an immediate consequence is that one extra decay process is always involved in the cascade decay leading to the lsp , and thus the missing ( transverse ) energy is generically degraded relative to the observed ( transverse ) energy .",

    "<S> the @xmath0 parameter of the mssm is replaced by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a singlet field , and the axion becomes a heavy pseudoscalar , @xmath3 , by adding a mass , @xmath4 , by hand . </S>",

    "<S> three models for the explicit pq breaking are given ; but the utility of this framework is that the predictions for all physics at the electroweak scale are independent of the particular model for pq breaking . </S>",
    "<S> this framework leads to a theory similar to the mssm , except that @xmath0 is predicted by the ciafaloni  </S>",
    "<S> pomarol relation , and there are light , weakly - coupled states that lie dominantly in the superfield @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the production and cascade decay of superpartners at colliders occurs as in the mssm , except that there is one extra stage of the cascade chain , with the next - to - lsp decaying to its `` superpartner '' and @xmath5 , dramatically altering the collider signatures for supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the framework is compatible with terrestrial experiments and astrophysical observations for a wide range of @xmath4 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath3 is as light as possible , @xmath7 , it can have interesting effects on the radiation energy density during the cosmological eras of nucleosynthesis and acoustic oscillations , leading to predictions for @xmath8 and @xmath9 different from 3 . </S>"
