    "the slowing down of the transition rate has , indeed , been found .",

    "the latter point should be very essential in any investigations of measurement problems .",
    "the quantum - mechanical description of the measurement device would allow us to study thoroughly the measurement process without explicit use of the projection postulate , or introducing different phenomenological terms in quantum evolution of the measured system .",

    "the solid line correspond to @xmath177 and the dashed line to @xmath224 .",
    "that the width of the energy distribution increases very strongly with @xmath179 , so that @xmath89 is almost flat for @xmath225 . in fact , the same strong broadening of the energy distribution takes place for @xmath102 .",
    "the described above measurement effects can be partially interpreted in terms of broadening of the level @xmath7 induced by the detector .",
    "one can expect that this broadening would always lead to spreading of the energy distribution . on the other hand",
    ", its influence on the decay rate depends whether the levels @xmath7 and @xmath55 are aligned or not . if @xmath101 the broadening of the level @xmath7 destroys the resonant - tunneling condition , so that the decay to continuum slows down . however ,",

    ", these arguments are not working at very short times , when the decay rate slows down even for @xmath102 , as shown in fig .",
    "in general , such intuitive arguments , based only on the level broadening can not explain all features of the energy distribution @xmath89 , especially if the coupling of the level @xmath55 with the reservoir is weak . in this case the energy distribution , given by eqs .",
    "( [ dd1 ] ) shows rather unusual dependence on the decoherence rate , @xmath179 , generated by the detector .",
    "let us take , for instance , @xmath226 , @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "the corresponding energy distribution @xmath180 is shown in fig .  8 for @xmath177 ( the solid line ) , @xmath229 ( the dashed line ) and @xmath209 ( the dashed - dot line ) .    the energy distribution @xmath89 as given by eq .",
    "( [ dd1 ] ) for @xmath226 , @xmath227 , and @xmath228 .",
    "the solid line correspond to @xmath177 the dashed line to @xmath229 , and the dashed - dot line to @xmath209 .    if there is no measurement ( @xmath177 ) the energy distribution @xmath89 is strongly peaked near @xmath7 , whereas the second peak , at @xmath230 , is almost invisible . yet , by switching the detector on , the second peak increases with @xmath179 .",
    "in fact , both peaks are equally pronounced already for @xmath224 .",
    "then , for @xmath231 the second peak becomes a dominant one ( the dashed - dot line ) , whereas the first peak practically disappears .",
    "thus we found that continuous monitoring of an electron in a double - dot system , weakly coupled with a reservoir changes completely the intensity of spectral lines .",
    "this can be partially interpreted in the following way .",
    "consider first the case of no measurement , @xmath177 .",
    "then a small coupling with the reservoir ( @xmath67 ) can not essentially affect the eigenstates of the system .",
    "these are close to @xmath103 , providing that these levels are strongly detuned .",
    "therefore the peak in the energy distribution of the tunneling electron lies near @xmath7 , since the electron occupies this level .",
    "however , if we switch on the detector , it would decohere the electron inside the double - dot , before it tunnels to the reservoir .",
    "this means that electron tends to be equally distributed between the dots . yet",
    "the second dot is directly coupled with the reservoir , whereas the first dot is not , ( fig .",
    "4 ) . as a result",
    ", the energy distribution would display the peak near @xmath55 .",
    "we presented detailed quantum - mechanical analyses of a decayed quantum system under continuous monitoring .",
    "as an example we considered an electron tunneling from a discrete level of quantum dot to the empty reservoir .",
    "the essential point in our analysis is a full quantum mechanical account of the macroscopic ( mesoscopic ) detector .",
    "this allowed us to investigate quantum zeno effect as generated by the schrdinger evolution of the entire system , without invoking the projection postulate .",
    "in contrast with the previous treatments , which concentrate only on the time - evolution , we analyzed here the complementary energy distribution of the decayed system , as well .",
    "the results of our analysis clearly demonstrate that the evolution of a decayed system under continuous monitoring is crucially related to the energy dependence of the density of states in the reservoir and the tunneling amplitude . if these quantities are weakly dependent on the energy , a pure exponential decay of the quantum system takes place . in this case",
    "the measurement does not affect the decay rate .",
    "yet , the energy distribution of the electron in the reservoir becomes strongly broadened . as a result ,",
    "the corresponding line - width is no more given by the inverse decay time .",
    "in the case of strong energy dependence of the density of states ( or of the tunneling amplitude ) the situation is different . as an example we considered the lorentzian component in the density of states of the width greater than the tunneling amplitude . in this case",
    "the decay is not an exponential one for small times .",
    "but it becomes exponential when the time increases .",
    "nevertheless , in contrast with the previous case the measurement affects the decay rate , even in the exponential regime .",
    "the effect , however , depends on displacement between the initial state energy and the mid - energy of the lorentzian density of states . if these energies are close to each other , we obtain the expected zeno effect , i.e. the slowing down of the decay rate at any time . yet , in the opposite case , when the displacement of these energies is larger than the lorentzian width , the measurement induces an acceleration of the decay rate in the regime of the exponential decay ( the anti - zeno effect ) . at small times",
    ", however , the measurement always slows down the decay rate .    with respect to the energy distribution of the tunneling particle , the measurement always generates strong broadening .",
    "however , for very narrow lorentzian shape of the density of states ( the lorentzian width is smaller than the tunneling amplitude ) the effect of the measurement is more peculiar .",
    "this takes place where the displacement between the initial energy and the lorentzian mid - energy is large .",
    "then , if there is no measurement , the energy distribution peaks near the initial state energy , whereas the second peak ( near the lorentzian center ) is very weak .",
    "however , when the measurement is switched on , the peak at the initial energy disappears with the increase of decoherence , generated by the detector . on the other hand , the second peak near the lorentzian mid - energy arises .",
    "all these results were obtained without taking into account the coupling of the fermionic quantum dots to the radiation or to the phonon fields .",
    "in fact , in a weak coupling regime our treatment can be extended to this case .",
    "yet , we do not expect any essential modification of the results obtained in this paper .",
    "the strong coupling regime , however , needs a special consideration .",
    "our analysis shows different effects generated by continuous measurement .",
    "all of them were obtained solely from the time - dependent schrdinger equation applied to the entire system .",
    "moreover , it looks that some of these effects might be in a contradiction with the projection postulate , which leads to the slowing of the decay rate .",
    "yet , this this point deserves special investigation on the level of the macroscopic description of the measuring device .",
    "it would involve a proper definition of the measurement time , needed for application of the projection postulate .",
    "although we are not coming to this point in our paper , we nevertheless consider our analysis as a necessary step for a better understanding of the measurement problem and the nature of the projection postulate .",
