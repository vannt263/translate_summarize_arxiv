    "there is a lot of interest in the study of the nature of dark energy , responsible for the acceleration of the cosmic expansion @xcite , and which is expected to have strange properties , like negative pressure and violates the strong energy condition .",
    "the current acceleration of the universe is realized when the parameter of equation of state ( eos ) @xmath10 , is such that @xmath11 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath12 corresponds to quintessence region where the expansion of the universe is accelerated , @xmath13 , but not super - accelerated @xmath14 .",
    "when @xmath15 , the universe is in a phantom region , which usually ends by finite - time future singularities @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently brevik et al analyse the possibility of whether there can be a turbulence micro - structure superimposed on the dark fluid @xcite .",
    "in such situation , in order to maintain the macroscopic isotropic , attention is attached to the isotropic version of turbulence .",
    "an important aspect of this issue is that turbulence implies a loss of kinetic energy , changing it into heat . at macroscopic level , this turbulence is often treated as bulk viscosity .",
    "so , at microscopic level , within turbulence consideration , the length scale associated with the macroscopic viscosity may be replaced by the kolmogorov microlength scale , conventionally denoted by @xmath16 @xcite . in that paper , authors assumed homogeneous equation of state and studied the influence of the turbulence on the evolution of the universe , mainly , in it dark sector .    in this paper , the goal remains the same , of studying the effects of the turbulence , but assuming inhomogeneous equation of state .",
    "we assume the eos @xmath17 in which @xmath18 and @xmath19 depend linearly on time .",
    "we also consider in this paper an oscillating @xmath18 .",
    "this particular king of eos is one alternative amongst a variety of possibilities , proposed to cope with the general dark energy problem @xcite , and developed for various purposes in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "following the same steps of @xcite we include the turbulence effect by adding a constant _ fraction _ , denoted @xmath20 , to the laminar ordinary energy density in the first equation of frw .",
    "then , we perform a perturbative analysis to the first order , assuming @xmath20 to be a small quantity and the correction term to @xmath18 and @xmath19 have been found . other interesting feature of considering this inhomogeneous eos is that it generalizes the brevik s results @xcite , at least , when frw equations with the fraction @xmath20 of the energy as turbulence energy are assumed .",
    "moreover , instead of only considering the above perturbative treatment , we also consider the total dark energy contribution as a laminar part plus a turbulence energy part .",
    "then , we study the stability of the system .",
    "the existence of an attractor critical point is investigated which should correspond to the stability of the system . within the assumption that the dynamics of the system essentially depends on the evolution of the turbulence and the radiation , we find that stability corresponds to a decreasing turbulence energy density and an increasing radiation energy density .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section @xmath21 , we present the kolmogorov s isotropic turbulence within inhomogeneous eos .",
    "section @xmath22 is devoted to the study of turbulence effects as a fraction of the energy in the frw equations , and this , for various assumptions of parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we investigate the stability of the system in the section @xmath23 where turbulence is assumed as an additive component to the total dark fluid .",
    "we present the conclusion in section @xmath24 .",
    "a most effect of the turbulence is the loss of kinetic energy into heat .",
    "as it is shown in @xcite , the macroscopic bulk viscosity may be substituted by the microscopic shear , from which the kolmogorov is directly proportional to @xmath25 and inversely proportional to @xmath26 where @xmath27 means the kinematic microscopic shear viscosity and @xmath28 the dissipation per unit of mass . by considering @xmath29 the external scale of the turbulence ,",
    "whereby @xmath30 denotes the corresponding wave number and assuming that the large eddies move with a little dissipation of energy . according to the second hypothesis of kolmogorov , in an isotropic region the motion is entirely by the friction and inertia @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is a continuous flux of energy transferred by the dissipation @xmath28 . by denoting the size of an eddy by @xmath31 and",
    "@xmath32 the corresponding wave number .",
    "the equilibrium range for the wave number for which all the flow is lost is @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath34 characterizes the typical velocity of an eddy of size @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the internal reynolds number gets the form re@xmath35 . for increasing values of @xmath36 , re@xmath37 decreases .",
    "when re@xmath38 , dissipation becomes important , corresponding to the condition which implies the kolmogorov length . for large values of reynolds number the quantities @xmath30 and @xmath39",
    "are completely separated and there exists an inertial subrange characterized by @xmath40 , where the fluid behaves like a non - viscous fluid @xcite . in the inertial subrange",
    "the formula of the spectral energy density is @xmath41 with @xmath42 being the kolmogorov constant .",
    "the total energy density can be calculated by integrating over all wave numbers @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we just focus our attention to the empirical decay law of the isotropic turbulence . based on grid experiments in wind and water tunnels , the mean kinetic energy @xmath43 decays as @xmath44 @xcite , as well as the theoretical treatment in @xcite .",
    "let us consider now the classical equation of motion for a viscous fluid @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the mass density and @xmath47 the momentum flux density tensor @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the shear viscosity @xcite .",
    "making use of the mean of this equation , and notifying that @xmath50 in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence , we get @xmath51 where @xmath19 is the variable cosmological constant , @xmath18 a variable parameter of equation of state , and @xmath52 is the effective pressure which takes into account that the thermodynamical pressure is augmented by a term @xmath53 associated with the turbulent energy density @xmath54 , meaning that @xmath55 designates a mean quantity .",
    "let us now consider this fluid in a cosmological setting . as usual in turbulence theory we may start by decomposing the fluid velocity @xmath56 into a mean component @xmath57 and a fluctuating component @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "on the other hand , in a comoving reference frame @xmath60 , so that we can simply replace @xmath58 with @xmath56 . requiring only the turbulence part of the cosmic fluid , far from the non - viscous ( non - turbulence ) part , one can from now adopt the notation for which the non - viscous terms are subscripted by zero . thus eq .  ( [ ainamon8 ] )",
    "is rewritten as @xmath61 the turbulence energy in the comoving frame can be view as a nonrelativistic quantity , and the total energy density can be written as @xmath62 let us look for the cosmological equations when a constant fraction @xmath20 of the energy exists in form of turbulence energy , and assume that the energy at initial time @xmath63 can be written as @xmath64 from this , we see that @xmath20 can be interpreted as the ratio between the turbulence energy and the total energy at @xmath63 , @xmath65 since the rest mass is completely incorporated in the total energy , the condition @xmath66 is required @xcite .",
    "therefore , for @xmath67 it is necessary @xmath68 decaying with time as @xmath69 , according to the time evolution of the ordinary turbulence @xcite .",

    "let us reconsider the expression ( [ 1hubbleosci ] ) .",
    "note that if @xmath154 , the denominator can be zero , which implies a cosmological singularity .",
    "however , if @xmath155 , singularity can not occur .",
    "it appears that both big rip and little rip may appear in dark energy within turbulence consideration .",
    "this kind of results has been found recently by brevik et al @xcite but not within oscillating inhomogeneous eos .",

    "in general the interaction terms @xmath167 , @xmath168 , are functions of the hubble parameter energy density @xmath169 .",
    "one obtains the critical points by equating the equations in ( [ firstsystem ] ) to zero .",
    "next , we will perturb the equations up to first order around the critical points and analyse their stability .",
    "only the stable critical point will be taken into account , i.e , the critical points for which all the eigenvalues of jacobian matrix are negative .",
    "these points are interpreted as attractor solutions of the dynamical system .    in this paper",
    "we will be restricted to pure physical situation .",
    "because of the turbulence , the kinetic energy changes into heat and the heat then becomes radiation .",
    "therefore , the interaction essential occurs between the turbulence and the radiation .",
    "consequently , we may set the interaction term @xmath170 to zero .",
    "as well known , we can make use of the value of eos of radiation ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "since the total content of the universe has to conserve , one gets @xmath172 . in such a situation ,",
    "since dark energy is assumed to not interact with the radiation , or the turbulence , one can consider its related parameter of equation of motion @xmath173 as constant and more precisely about @xmath174 .",

    "this choice of the sign of @xmath183 and @xmath184 is purely cosmological since as the turbulence contributes as a type of dark fluid , its pressure has to be negative in order to insure the acceleration of the universe and a necessary condition for this is assuming @xmath183 and @xmath184 as negative constants .",
    "the system presents two realistic critical points : a)@xmath185 $ ] and b ) @xmath186 $ ] .",
    "the first critical point correspond to the situation where the kinetic energy of the turbulence is still conserved , i.e , there is any change of the kinetic energy into heat .",
