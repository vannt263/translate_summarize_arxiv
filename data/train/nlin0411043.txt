    "domain walls are localized structures typical of spatially extended systems with broken phase invariance , where two or more homogeneous states with different phases occupy different patches , the walls being defects connecting two of such states or domains .",
    "two different types of walls can exist in systems described by a complex order parameter , namely ising and bloch walls , which differ in the way the phase changes between the two domains as the wall is crossed : an ising wall is characterized by a discontinuous variation of the field phase across the wall , whereas in a bloch wall the phase angle rotates continuously accross the wall . as this rotation can occur in two different senses bloch walls are chiral .",
    "( contrarily , the ising wall is not chiral . )",
    "alternatively , the order parameter is null at the core of an ising wall , while in a bloch wall the order parameter does not vanish at any point . for this reason ,",
    "ising and bloch walls are often referred to as dark and grey solitons , respectively .",
    "when the system dynamics does not derive from a potential other crucial difference between ising and bloch walls refers to their dynamics : ising walls are stationary ( static ) , while bloch walls move with a velocity related to their chirality .",
    "both types of domain walls may exist in different parameter regions , and in this case they bifurcate one into another via a nonequilibrium ising - bloch ( ib ) transition @xcite , which can be interpreted as a bifurcation of the wall chirality @xcite .",
    "the ib transition has been found in systems of very different nature , such as nematic liquid crystals @xcite or reaction  diffusion systems @xcite . in the optical context , the phenomenon has been predicted to occur in type i @xcite and type ii @xcite optical parametric oscillators ; from the experimental point of view it is to be mentioned a related study @xcite where larionova _ et al _ have analysed the dynamics of two - dimensional phase domains in a photorefractive oscillator in a degenerate four  wave mixing configuration : _ _ within the same ( closed ) wall they found both bloch  type and ising  type segments .",
    "they did not observe , however , the nonequilibrium ib transition , probably because of the 2d character of their system , which complicates the dynamics of domain walls with curvature effects .",
    "in fact the first experimental observation of the nonequilibrium ib transition in optics has been confirmed very recently in the ( transversely ) one  dimensional version of the same device @xcite .",
    "the possibility of domain walls as stable states has a particular interest in nonlinear optical systems , given the potential use of localized structures in all  optical signal processing .",
    "in nonlinear optical cavities , the structures develop in the transverse plane , perpendicular to the resonator axis , and can be controlled by external parameters @xcite .",
    "optical systems with a kerr nonlinearity have been shown to exhibit a rich spatio ",
    "temporal dynamics , see @xcite and references therein for details . concerning the nonequilibrium ising ",
    "bloch transition , the kerr cavity , consisting of an optical resonator filled with a kerr medium and driven by a external coherent field , is a good candidate for exhibiting it , as this system presents the basic requirement of broken phase invariance . the original model proposed by lugiato and lefever @xcite",
    "was later extended in @xcite to include the vector character of the light fields , what allows to describe instabilities of the light polarization state .",
    "this work was extended in @xcite where the case of elliptically polarized input was considered and in @xcite where two dimensional domain walls in the form of dark - ring solitons were studied .",
    "recently these works were generalized by considering the possibility of dichroism and/or birefringence in the optical cavity for the two linear polarization components @xcite .",
    "it was shown that large enough cavity anisotropy or birefringence substantially modifies the dynamics of the system .",
    "in particular , they allow for the polarization instability to rule pattern formation in self - focusing kerr cavities , something that does not occur in isotropic cavities ( without birefringence or dichroism ) @xcite",
    ". moreover , as the polarization instability can be subcritical for large enough dichroism or birefringence @xcite bright cavity solitons can exist , which in this case are polarization solitons @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was also shown that in the limit of large anisotropy ( when the losses of the two polarization components are very different in magnitude ) , the dynamics of the system can be described by a single order parameter obeying a universal equation , namely the parametrically  driven , damped nonlinear schrdinger equation ( pdnlse ) . for our purposes",
    "the recent prediction @xcite that the pdnlse contains an ib transition and that ising and bloch domain walls can connect either spatially uniform or patterned states is of special relevance .",
    "this equation has been derived in different contexts ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , in the optical context , the pdnlse has been shown to describe ( apart from the anisotropic kerr resonator @xcite ) the degenerate optical parametric oscillator @xcite and optical fibre loops with parametric amplification @xcite .    however , despite the generality of the results obtained in @xcite , their applicability to the kerr cavity is strictly valid only in the case of strong anisotropy , a very restrictive condition . in this paper",

    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "the system considered in this paper is an optical resonator with plane mirrors filled with an isotropic @xmath0 medium of self - focusing type and driven by a spatially homogeneous linearly polarized coherent field of amplitude @xmath1 ( taken real without loss of generality ) that propagates along the resonator axis @xmath2 .",
    "the resonator is anisotropic ( dichroic ) , _",
    "i.e. _ , the two intracavity field polarization components @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( parallel and orthogonal to the input field , respectively ) experience different linear losses ( with associated cavity linewidths @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively ) .",
    "in order to avoid curvature effects that strongly influence domain wall dynamics , we assume a transversely 1d problem ( that can be experimentally achieved with a slab waveguide geometry that confines the fields along one transverse dimension ( say @xmath7 ) , or with rectangular slits placed in appropriate planes @xcite ) .",
    "the adimensional model equations for such a system in the mean field limit read @xcite:@xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are normalized cavity detunings ( @xmath11 is the angular frequency of the input field and @xmath12 are the frequencies of the cavity longitudinal modes with polarization parallel and orthogonal to the input closest to @xmath11 ) , @xmath13 is the cavity anisotropy parameter ; @xmath14 accounts for diffraction ( the transverse spatial coordinate @xmath15 is normalized to the diffraction coefficient ) and @xmath16 is time normalized to @xmath17 .",
    "finally , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the maker and terhune coefficients , which verify @xmath20 for isotropic media @xcite , which we consider . for details on the normalizations",
    "see @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the pattern formation properties of this model have been studied for @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we extended the model to the anisotropic cavity ( @xmath23 ) first considering the plane  wave model ( no diffraction ) @xcite and then considering pattern formation @xcite , where we concentrated in the limit of large cavity anisotropy and demonstrated that the pdnlse describes the system in this limit .",
    "later , in @xcite we studied patern formation and localized structures due to birefringence ( @xmath24 ) .    in the following ,",
    "the case @xmath25 ( no birefringence ) is considered .",
    "also we restrict the study to the case when the nonlinear material is a liquid ( e.g. , @xmath26 ) , for which @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "this makes that our results could apply , e.g. , to cells of liquid crystal in the isotropic phase ( nematic liquid crystals , which have a much larger nonlinearity , are not covered by our analysis as they are _ anisotropic _ nonlinear media ) .",
    "most relevant for our study are the symmetries supported by eqs .",
    "( [ modelo1],[modelo2 ] ) .",
    "in particular the term @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ modelo1 ] ) completely breaks the phase symmetry of field @xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless , the model still supports the discrete symmetry @xmath30 .",
    "( note that the four - wave mixing term -the one multiplied by @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ modelo2])- breaks the continuous phase symmetry . )",
    "this symmetry means that whenever a state @xmath32 is a solution of the system , another solution @xmath33 exists as well that is dynamically equivalent ( has the same dynamical properties like stability , etc . ) to the former .",
    "as @xmath3 and @xmath4 correspond to the two orthogonal components of the light electric field vector , the above symmetry relates two equivalent solutions having opposite helicity , appart from a different polarization ellipse orientation .",
    "this symmetry thus opens the possibility of exciting domain walls that join asymptotically two of such symmetric states . on the other hand , the reflection @xmath34 and translation @xmath35 invariances of the problem",
    "imply that if a bloch wall of given chirality exists , another , equivalent one of opposite chirality also exists , and both move in opposite directions @xcite .",
    "the existence conditions and dynamic behaviour of domain walls , the main subject of this article , is strongly related with the stability properties of the homogeneous solutions connected by the walls . in the system described by eqs .",
    "( [ modelo1 ] ) and ( [ modelo2 ] ) , these solutions have been analyzed in @xcite , and we review here the main results .    according to the polarization state of the intracavity field two kinds of steady homogeneous solutions are possible : ( i ) the _ linearly polarized state _ , with intensities @xmath36 and @xmath37 given by the solutions of @xmath38 i_{0 } , \\label{linhom}%\\ ] ] and ( ii ) the _ elliptically polarized state _ , with intensities determined by @xmath39 ^{2},\\label{pol.hom.1}\\\\ i_{1 }   &   = \\delta-\\mathcal{a}i_{0}\\pm\\sqrt{\\left (   \\frac{\\mathcal{b}}{2}% i_{0}\\right )   ^{2}-1}. \\label{pol.hom.2}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the linearly polarized solution eq .",
    "( [ linhom ] ) shows a multivalued character when @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the elliptically polarized solution eq .",
    "( [ pol.hom.1 ] ) was analyzed in detail in @xcite and can be a multivalued function as well .",
    "the cavity anisotropy parameter @xmath41 plays an important role on the character of the polarization instability ( i.e. , the bifurcation affecting the linearly polarized solution that sets the onset of eliptically polarized emission ) , as shown in @xcite .",
    "in particular the polarization instability can become subcritical for @xmath42 ( the exact value at which this occurs depends on the detuning value ) whenever @xmath43 . in this case",
    "bright cavity solitons can be supported by the system at low pumpings @xcite .",
    "more important for the present study is the fact that for large @xmath41 the anisotropic kerr cavity model can be reduced to a pdnlse , which exhibits an ib transition @xcite .",
    "this implies that the anisotropic kerr cavity will exhibit the same phenomenon for large enough @xmath41 . in order to test the universality of this phenomenon",
    "we investigate here a cavity with moderate anisotropy and take @xmath44 for definiteness .",
    "we note that for this value of @xmath41 the model can not be rigorously reduced to a pdnlse and then some extra features can be expected .",
    "the stability of the linearly polarized solution ( [ linhom ] ) against space - dependent perturbations was analyzed in @xcite , where analytical expressions for the different boundaries and wavenumber of the emerging patterns were obtained . in fig .",
    "1 the stability of the different solutions is shown on the plane @xmath45 , which are the only free parameters . in the figure ,",
    "the linearly polarized solution ( [ linhom ] ) is stable below curve @xmath46 , which corresponds to the polarization instability . above this curve",
    "the linearly polarized state is no more a stable solution and gives rise to the elliptically polarized solution ( [ pol.hom.1],[pol.hom.2 ] ) . in its turn",
    ", this last solution exists above line @xmath47 , i.e. , there is a domain of coexistence between the linearly and elliptically polarized solutions , marked in the figure as bs , between lines @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we consider now the existence of pattern forming instabilities of the elliptically polarized solution ( [ pol.hom.1],[pol.hom.2 ] ) , which are of relevance for the analysis of the dynamics of domain walls performed below . following the usual procedure",
    ", we consider perturbations of the homogeneous solutions in the form @xmath48 , and re@xmath49 signals a bifurcation . unlike the case of the linearly polarized solution @xcite , the stability analysis is now quite involved and analytic expressions can not be obtained .",
    "instead , we perform a numerical analysis of the eigenvalues @xmath50 to determine the instability boundaries .    the pattern formation instability boundary affecting the elliptically polarized solution ( [ pol.hom.1],[pol.hom.2 ] ) corresponds to the piecewise curve ( with dashed and dotted segments ) joining the points @xmath51 .",
    "beyond this line ( shadowed area ) , the elliptically polarized solution is modulationaly unstable .    the complex form of this boundary follows from the dependence of the real part of the largest eigenvalue with the wavenumber of the perturbation . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the real part of the eigenvalue ( solid line ) evaluated for parameters corresponding to point ( b ) in fig . 1 shows two maxima at different wavenumbers .",
    "depending on the parameter setting the threshold is minimum for the smallest wavenumber ( dashed lines @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) or for the largest wavenumber ( dotted lines @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) .",
    "consequently , the points denoted by @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the figure correspond to codimension-2 points , where the instability is reached at two different wavenumbers simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , the imaginary part of the eigenvalue is null in the first cases ( dashed lines @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) , thus corresponding to the emergence of stationary patterns , but non null in the second cases ( dotted lines @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) , see fig .",
    "2 , thus corresponding to a hopf bifurcation that gives rise to the appearance of dynamic patterns whose amplitude oscillates in time . finally ,",
    "as stated , the region marked with in fig .",
    "1 denotes the domain of coexistence between linearly and elliptically polarized states .",
    "when this coexistence is bistable and one of the states ( the elliptically polarized state in this case ) is spatially modulated ( shadowed region ) , bright cavity solitons can be also excited @xcite .",
    "we performed the numerical integration of eqs .",
    "( [ modelo1 ] ) and ( [ modelo2 ] ) with a split  step algorithm , for @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath25 , and @xmath44 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were used that impose an even number of walls in the transverse domain . a spatial grid of 2048 points was used and the temporal step was lowered down to @xmath59 in order to otain @xmath60independent results . as an initial condition , two walls were placed symmetrically with respect to the center of the integration window .",
    "several integration region lengths @xmath61 were investigated .",
    "results shown here correspond to the choice @xmath62 , which ensured enough spatial separation between the two walls in order to avoid their mutual interaction during the initial stage of the evolution .",
    "for some parameter settings the walls reached a static configuration after a transient , having fixed their position across the transverse plane . in such cases it was assessed that walls were ising ones by verifying that the complex field @xmath4 was zero at the wall core .",
    "for other parameter values walls reached a moving configuration and were identified as bloch walls as there was no point in the transverse plane where the complex field @xmath4 was zero .",
    "note that the following analysis of the results refers to the cross polarized component @xmath4 that is the one in which domain walls can be clearly identified as dark solitons @xcite as walls join two domains where the values of @xmath4 have opposite signs ( phases ) as discussed .",
    "figure 1 summarizes our numerical findings . for low values of both pump @xmath1 and detuning @xmath63 ( inside the region labeled `` ising '' , delimited by the solid lines joining points @xmath64 , and line @xmath47 ) stable ising walls are found .",
    "these ising walls connect homogeneous states in most of this region , except in the thin white areas at the right of the dashed line @xmath53 and the dotted line @xmath55 , where they connect patterned states , in agreement with the linear stability analysis discussed above . by increasing the pump or the detuning from this region we observe ib transitions , marked with solid lines",
    "@xmath65 , where ising walls are replaced by bloch walls .",
    "beforme commenting the differences between the various ising  bloch transition lines ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) ,",
    "let us comment about what happens in the small region above line @xmath54 , where the behaviour is somewhat anomalous . in the small domain between this line and the dark  grey shadowed area marked as `` ''",
    "the walls are unstable , and the single pattern supported by the system are rolls .",
    "then , strictly speaking , the domain `` '' extends until the line @xmath54 .",
    "if we have let this domain without including it in the `` '' domain is just because in it a very long transient behaviour in the dynamics of the walls is observed until walls eventually dissapear and the system develops a spatially periodic state .",
    "this behaviour ( longest transient ) is in contrast with what happens in the `` '' domain , where domain walls dissapear sharply .    at the right of the point @xmath69 , when increasing the pump , two different regimes can be clearly distinguished , depending on detuning . for small detunings the transition",
    "is denoted by @xmath66 in fig . 1 ( continuous line ) , and in this case the bloch walls ( that exist inside the `` triangle '' @xmath70 ) connect homogeneous states . for the chosen values of the parameters ,",
    "this regime exists up to @xmath71 for larger detunings , the transition is mainly ruled by the pattern forming instability experienced by the domains joined by the walls ( @xmath67 in fig . 1 , represented by continuous curve ) .",
    "note that , for moderate detunings ( in the center of the plot ) , the @xmath72 and pattern forming boundaries are nearly coincident . in this case",
    "the bloch walls always connect patterned states .",
    "finally , for small pump but large detunings , another region @xmath68 of bloch walls is found ( right side of the curve @xmath73 ) .",
    "the bloch walls in this region move with a extremelly small , random velocity , similarly to what happens in the pdnlse without diffusion or saturation terms @xcite .",
    "an example of a bloch wall corresponding to the transition @xmath66 , obtained for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , is shown in fig .",
    "3 . in fig .",
    "3(a ) the intensity distribution in transverse space near the core of the wall is given , and in fig .",
    "3(b ) we show the corresponding phase  portrait ( i.e. , a plot of the real versus the imaginary part of the field ) .",
    "both pictures are alternative representations where the bloch character of the wall is evidenced : the intensity at the wall core is small , but non null , fig .",
    "3(a ) , and a smooth variation of the phase between the domains separated by the wall is appreciated in the parametric plot in fig .",
    "for these parameters , the homogeneous solutions which constitute the domains connected by the wall are modulationally stable .",
    "as stated in the introduction , an essential feature of bloch walls in nonvariational systems is that , contrary to ising walls , they move in the transverse plane , with a velocity that depends on the parameters . for a fixed value of the detuning @xmath76",
    ", the dependence of the wall velocity with the pump is shown in fig .",
    "4 . for this particular value of the detuning , in the region where the background solutions are modulationally unstable",
    ", the walls no more exist as commented , since spatial modulations of the background grow and fill completely the transverse space leading eventually to a roll pattern .",
    "let us now describe the dynamic behaviour of bloch walls .",
    "as stated in the previous section the use of periodic boundary conditions forces that the number of domain walls that can exist within the integration window be an even number , two is the minimum . on",
    "the other hand bloch walls move with a velocity whose sign depends on their chirality . then two situations are possible , namely , that the two bloch walls have either the same or different chiralities ( notice that the _ sign _ of the chirality of the bloch walls is fixed by the initial conditions ) . when the chiralities are the same , the two bloch walls move along parallel paths and no interaction between them appears ( at least when their movement is regular : when it is highly irregular the chirality of the walls can change independently of each other @xcite ) .",
    "contrarily , when the chiralities are opposite the paths followed by the two bloch walls intersect and a collision occurs . as a result",
    "a new localized structure may appear and a bound state is formed .",
    "this bound state is a cavity soliton different from a wall .",
    "although a detailed study of these objects falls outide the scope of the present work , and without trying to be exhaustive in their characterization , we just note that two different behaviours of the new cavity soliton have been identified .    for small detunings ( i.e. inside the triangle @xmath70 above the region @xmath66 in fig .",
    "1 ) , after the collision the positions of the walls delimiting the cavity soliton perform small amplitude antiphase periodic oscillations , as shown in fig .",
    "4 ; hence the cavity soliton performs a breathing dynamics , remaining constant its position in the transverse plane .    for higher detunings ( above the region @xmath67 )",
    "bound states are also formed as a result of the interaction , but their dynamics is different . in these cases , after the collision one wall is dragged by the other and the resulting bound state drifts with the velocity of one of the original bloch walls as shown in fig .",
    "5 .    finally , we note that near but below the boundary @xmath54 , the walls do not form bound states after the interaction , but instead bounce and exchange their chiralities . such behaviour is shown in fig .",
    "although it is difficult to determine the origin of these behaviours after a collision is produced , the reason for these different behaviours is very likely linked to the different dynamics of the patterned state that the walls connect , whose complicated spatio  temporal dynamics depends on the parameter set . in the next section , where we concentrate in the dynamic behaviour of isolated bloch walls ,",
    "we give some clues on how the pattern dynamics affects the wall behaviour .",
    "in the small detuning regime , bloch walls behave in a regular manner and the motion occurs at a constant velocity as in the case shown in fig . 7 . for higher detunings",
    "however , the wall dynamics shows features which are characteristic of excitable systems .",
    "the wall motion is in fact regular only close to the @xmath67 transition , which nearly coincides with the pattern formation boundary , see fig .",
    "1 . for higher pump values , wall dynamics is characterized by an irregular behaviour of the wall position .",
    "we report next several numerical examples of such irregular motion , obtained for @xmath77 and different values of the detuning @xmath63 .    in fig .",
    "8 , a bursting phenomenon ( the appearance of almost periodic oscillations during time intervals of arbitrary duration ) , is observed both in the wall position , fig .",
    "8(a ) , and chirality , fig .",
    "8(b ) , for @xmath78 .",
    "( we used the definition of chirality @xmath79 @xcite where @xmath80 denotes the point where the wall intensity @xmath81 is at its minimum ) . after experiencing several bursts",
    ", the wall velocity turns to be constant again , but in this case with a chirality of opposite sign with respect to the initial one . during the steady motion , the chirality takes a very small value , @xmath82 , and consequently the change in sign is not appreciated in fig .",
    "8(a ) , owing to the scale imposed by the bursting events .",
    "however , this change is manifested in fig .",
    "8(b ) as a change in the sign of the wall velocity .",
    "the number of bursts and final chirality depends in general on the parameter values and initial conditions , such as the amplitude and relative position of the walls .",
    "a slight increase in the detuning leads to a qualitatively different behaviour , namely a spiking in the wall position .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "9 , obtained for @xmath83 . in this case",
    "the bursts appear periodically in time , in the form of spikes .",
    "the intensity distribution of the bloch wall during the spiking regime is shown in fig .",
    "the wall connects two patterned states with different spatial distributions .",
    "the pattern on the right side of the wall in fig .",
    "10 is spatially harmonic , contains a single spatial frequency , while the pattern of the left side of the wall is bi - periodic , and both a fundamental and a small amplitude second spatial harmonic are present .",
    "this particular structure of the domain walls has been observed in all the numerical simulations in the irregular regime , and seems to be at the root of the complex behaviour exhibited by the wall dynamics .",
    "these numerical results suggest that the complex dynamic behaviour of bloch walls is related with secondary instabilities of the extended roll patterns which form the domains at both sides of the wall .",
    "in particular , numerics show that bursting and spiking of the wall position always develop in coincidence with the appearance of a second spatial frequency in the intensity of the roll pattern forming one of the domains . to check this statement , eqs .",
    "( [ modelo1 ] ) and ( [ modelo2 ] ) were integrated in the absence of walls , and the spatial distribution of roll patterns was studied .",
    "a summary of results is given in fig .",
    "11 , corresponding to roll patterns obtained for a fixed value of the pump @xmath77 and for different detunings , in accordance with figs .",
    "the distributions shown in figs .",

    "<S> bloch walls can show regular or irregular temporal behaviour , in particular , bursting and spiking . </S>",
    "<S> these phenomena are interpreted in terms of the spatio - temporal dynamics of the extended patterns connected by the wall , which display complex dynamical behaviour as well . </S>",
    "<S> domain wall interaction , including the formation of bound states is also addressed . </S>"
