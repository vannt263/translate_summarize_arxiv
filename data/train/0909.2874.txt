    "this system has served as a workforce model to study synchronization because it allows analysis of the network influence without detailed specification of the properties of the dynamical units .",
    "for example , using a stability function @xmath17 that is independent of the network structure @xcite , the condition for a synchronous state @xmath18 to be linearly stable is @xmath19 for @xmath20 , where @xmath21 are the non - identically zero eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix @xmath22 defined by @xmath23 ( see _ materials and methods _ ) .",
    "thus , the smaller the normalized spread of the eigenvalues in the complex plane , which we quantify using @xmath24 the more synchronizable the network will generally be .",
    "another measure of synchronizability is the coupling cost @xmath25 at the synchronization threshold @xmath26 , whose minimization is equivalent to the condition @xmath27 which is also equivalent to the condition @xmath28 .",
    "this condition constrains all the eigenvalues to be real , even though the networks can be directed and directed networks have complex eigenvalues in general .",
    "condition  * [ optimal ] * is also equivalent to the maximization of the range of @xmath29 that allows for stable synchronization as well as to the maximization of dynamical robustness , in that it can achieve the fastest exponential convergence to synchronization ( see _ materials and methods _ ) .",
    "( this may relate , for example , to the finding that heterogeneous distribution of links , which tend to make the distribution of @xmath30 s heterogeneous , leads to longer transients to synchronization in ecological network models with strong couplings @xcite . )",
    "we emphasize that the equivalence of these conditions holds for a wide variety of possible stability functions , including those for which the region defined by @xmath31 may be finite or semi- infinite , or have multiple disconnected components .",
    "having the maximum range , minimum coupling cost , and maximum dynamical robustness , the networks satisfying eq .  *",
    "[ optimal ] * are called the optimal networks for synchronization .",
    "similar results can be derived for networks of non - identical units , in which the functions @xmath10 and @xmath32 are possibly different for different nodes , and this more general case will be discussed below .",
    "a surprising consequence of having these optimal synchronization properties is the quantization of the number of links in the networks .",
    "we find , for example , that for binary interaction networks ( i.e. , @xmath33 ) satisfying condition   * [ optimal ] * , the number of links @xmath34 is quantized to multiples of @xmath35 .",
    "that is , @xmath36 this follows from the identity @xmath37 , combined with the fact that condition  * [ optimal ] * constrains the real eigenvalue @xmath38 further to be an integer for networks with integer - valued interactions ( see supporting information , section 1 ) .",
    "consequently , any network with @xmath39 strictly between these quantized values must have @xmath40 , and hence can not be optimal .",
    "what is then the minimum @xmath41 for all such networks with a given @xmath39 ? we denote this minimum by @xmath42 .",
    "based on our analysis of all networks with @xmath43 , we conjecture that the condition to achieve this minimum is that the laplacian eigenvalues ( counting multiplicity ) have the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the integer satisfying @xmath46 .",
    "note that , analogously to eq .  *",
    "[ quantization ] * for @xmath47 , this condition asserts that the eigenvalues are not only real but also integer for any @xmath39 .",
    "this leads to our prediction that @xmath48 which is expected to be valid for binary interaction networks with arbitrary number of nodes and links . indeed , fig .",

    "starting from the ( optimal ) fully connected network [ with @xmath52 at the right end of the curve @xmath53 , any initial link deletion necessarily makes synchronization more difficult .",
    "further deletions , however , can make it easier , bringing the networks back to optimal periodically as a function of @xmath39 at the cusp points and eventually leading to ( optimal ) directed spanning trees with @xmath54 ( see supporting video ) .",
    "the optimization of synchronization at these cusp points is analogous to the optimization of the dynamical range of excitable networks at the critical points of phase transitions @xcite .",
    "similar cusps are also observed for the laplacian eigenvalues of a structurally perturbed optimal network as a function of the perturbation ( see supporting information , section 2 ) .",
    "note that , although the cost @xmath55 generally depends on @xmath39 , it is actually independent of @xmath39 for optimal networks of given size @xmath3 because the synchronization threshold @xmath56 compensates for any change in @xmath39 .",

    "all other networks with the same @xmath39 and @xmath3 are represented by points directly above that point .",
    "the evolution of one such network by rewiring links under pressure to optimize synchronizability can be visualized as a vertical descent from a point above the landscape toward a point on the landscape that minimizes @xmath41 ( red arrow in fig .",
    "[ quantization]_b _ ) .",
    "the sharp valleys are observed along the lines @xmath47 , and therefore correspond to the cusp points in fig .",
    "[ quantization]_a_. because two adjacent points on the landscape may include networks that do not have similar structures , it is surprising that one can actually move from one point to the next often by a simple structural modification ( see supporting video ) . indeed , moving in the direction of the @xmath39-coordinate can be achieved by simply adding or removing a link that induces the smallest increase or largest decrease in @xmath41 . along the line @xmath47 , an optimal network can be `` grown '' and kept optimal , by adding a node and connecting any @xmath45 existing nodes to the new node ( see supporting information , section 3 ) .",
    "the flexibility of choosing new links in this construction strongly suggests that optimal networks can have arbitrarily complex connectivity structures as the network size grows .",
    "another interesting landscape appears when we compute the cost @xmath64 as a function of @xmath39 and @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ quantization]_c _ ) based on condition  * [ eqn : ev]*. in this landscape , optimal networks lie along the lines of discontinuity , resulting from the discontinuous change in @xmath67 that occurs when @xmath39 changes from @xmath68 to @xmath69 and defines a saw - tooth function along the @xmath39-coordinate .",
    "note that for optimal networks , the cost @xmath64 is independent of @xmath39 , as mentioned above , but increases linearly with @xmath3 and can be expressed as @xmath70 , where @xmath65 is the coupling cost for a network of two coupled units .",
    "a different but potentially related structure is the roughness of the time horizon considered in the synchronization of parallel processing units in distributed computing @xcite .",
    "while the presentation above focused on networks of identical units , the main results also hold true for networks of non - identical units . adopting the framework of ref .",
    "@xcite and developing further analysis for networks of one - dimensional maps , we show in supporting information ( section 4 ) that complete synchronization is possible even for non - identical units .",
    "moreover , we show that this is possible only for networks satisfying eq .  *",
    "[ optimal ] * in addition to the condition that the laplacian matrix @xmath22 is diagonalizable . since any such networks",
    "must also exhibit the same quantization expressed in eq .  *",
    "[ quantization ] * , we also expect cusps similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ quantization ] . for each quantized number of links @xmath69",
    ", we can show that there is a network that can synchronize completely despite the heterogeneity of the dynamical units .",
    "therefore , for both identical _ and _ non - identical units , condition  * [ eqn : ev ] * can be used to systematically construct examples of suboptimal networks that can be made optimal by either adding or removing links .",
    "interestingly , the exact same quantization effect described above for binary interaction networks is also observed when we allow for negative interactions and interpret @xmath71 as the _ net _ number of links . to see this",
    ", we use a generalization of the complement network , which we define for a given constant @xmath72 to be the network with adjacency matrix @xmath73 given by @xmath74 ( this includes the special case @xmath75 , which for undirected unweighted networks corresponds to the previously studied case of complement graphs @xcite . ) the transformation from a network to its complement maps @xmath39 to @xmath76 , @xmath30 to @xmath77 , @xmath41 to @xmath78 , and thus an optimal network to another optimal network when @xmath79 ( see _ materials and methods _ ) .",
    "this also establishes a mapping between networks capable of complete synchronization of non - identical units , since the laplacian matrix for such a network remains diagonalizable under the transformation ( see supporting information , section 4 ) .",
    "the condition on @xmath80 avoids ( nonsynchronizable ) networks having eigenvalues with negative real part as an artifact of the transformation .",
    "we argue that this generalized complement transformation is a powerful tool in analyzing networks with negative interactions because it reduces problems involving negative interactions to those involving only positive interactions when we choose @xmath81 .    as an example of quantization with negative interactions",
    ", we consider the class of networks for which @xmath82 and assume that @xmath83 have positive real parts to ensure that the network can synchronize .",
    "mapping these networks under the complement transformation with @xmath75 , we obtain positive interaction networks with @xmath84 .",

    "our simulated annealing shows , however , that many optimal networks ( i.e. , with @xmath85 ) have negative interactions , as illustrated by an example in fig .",
    "[ exampleoptimal ] .",
    "in addition , complete synchronization of non - identical units is possible in the presence of negative interactions ( see supporting information , section 4 ) .",
    "these networks provide clear and systematic examples of negative interactions that improve synchronization , as removing negative interactions from any such network would in general push @xmath39 off the quantized values ( @xmath47 ) and make the network suboptimal .    the quantization of @xmath39 and the shape of the synchronization landscape , though they were identical for the two examples above , do depend critically on the constraints imposed on the interactions .",

    "an optimal network can be constructed for any number of links @xmath94 ( e.g. , the hierarchical networks in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which implies that @xmath59 is identically zero in this particular case .    to demonstrate that the synchronization enhancement by negative interactions goes much beyond the realm of optimal networks , we propose a simple algorithm for assigning strength @xmath2 to directional links in an arbitrary network with all link strengths initially equal to @xmath1 .",
    "our strategy is based on the observation that the in - degree distribution is a main factor determining synchronizability  @xcite , where the in - degree ( or the total input strength ) of node @xmath7 is defined to be @xmath95 . since heterogeneity in the in - degree",
    "distribution tends to inhibit synchronization @xcite , here we use negative interactions to compensate for positive interactions and to homogenize the in - degree distribution . for a given network",
    ", we first choose randomly a node with the smallest in - degree and change the strength of each out - link of that node to @xmath2 , unless it makes the in - degree of the target node smaller than the mean in - degree of the original network .",
    "we keep strength @xmath1 for the other out - links , as well as all the in - links .",

    "the synchronization enhancement was indeed accompanied by the homogenization of the in - degree distribution ( see supporting information , section 5 ) .",
    "the use of negative directional interactions in our algorithm suggests that the enhancement is partly due to link directionality ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an enhancement method purely based on link directionality ) , which generally plays an important role in synchronization ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , negative strength of interactions alone can also produce similar enhancement in random scale - free networks when they are assigned to bidirectional links between hubs ( see supporting information , section 6 ) .     improving synchronization with negative interactions .",

    "even though negative interactions and link removals by themselves tend to destabilize synchronous states , we have shown that they can compensate for other instabilities , such as those resulting from a  forbidden \" number of interactions or from a heterogeneous in - degree distribution .",
    "this establishes an unexpected relation between network synchronization and recent work on metabolic networks , where locally deleterious perturbations have been found to generate similar compensatory effects that are globally beneficial in the presence of other deleterious perturbations @xcite .",
    "for example , the removal of a metabolic reaction  or , equivalently , of its enzyme - coding gene(s )  can often be partially or totally compensated by the targeted removal of a second metabolic reaction .",
    "that is , the inactivation of specific metabolic reactions can improve the performance of defective or sub - optimally operating metabolic networks , and in some cases it can even rescue cells that would be nonviable otherwise @xcite .",
    "other research has shown that similar reaction inactivation occurs spontaneously for cells evolved to optimize specific metabolic objectives @xcite .",
    "these apparently disparate examples share the common property that the collective dynamics is controlled , and in fact enhanced , by _ constraining _ rather than augmenting the underlying network . such network - based control , including the conditionally positive impact of otherwise detrimental interactions and constraints , is most likely not unique to these contexts .    in neuronal networks , for example",
    ", inhibitory interactions have been predicted to facilitate synchronous bursting @xcite .",
    "even more compelling , it has been established for both animal @xcite and human @xcite cerebral cortices that the density of synapses first increases and then decreases during early brain development , suggesting a positive role played by link removal also in neuronal networks .",
    "more generally , we expect that the eigenvalue spectrum analysis that lead to our conclusions will help investigate analogous behavior in yet other classes of network processes governed by spectral properties , such as epidemic spreading @xcite and cascading failures @xcite .",
    "taken together , the highly structured characteristics revealed by the synchronization landscape explain why the characterization of the network properties that govern synchronization has been so elusive .",
    "numerous previous studies performed under comparable conditions have sometimes led to apparently conflicting conclusions about the role played by specific network structural properties such as randomness , betweenness centrality , and degree distribution @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that at least part of these disagreements can be attributed to the sensitive dependence of the synchronization properties on the specific combination of nodes and links , as clearly illustrated by the non - monotonic , periodic structure of cusps exhibited by the synchronization landscape .",
    "we suggest that insights provided by these findings will illuminate the design principles and evolution mechanisms of both natural and engineered networks in which synchronization is functionally important  @xcite .",
    "the stability analysis can be carried out using a master stability approach based on linearizing eq .   * [ maineqn ] * around synchronous states @xcite .",
    "we apply a coordinate transformation to reduce the laplacian matrix @xmath22 to its jordan canonical form and decompose the variational equations into components along the corresponding eigenspaces @xcite .",
    "this leads to a master stability equation , @xmath99 \\mathbf{y},\\ ] ] where @xmath100 for the eigenspace corresponding to @xmath30 .",
    "the stability function @xmath101 is the maximum lyapunov exponent for the solution @xmath102 of eq .  *",
    "[ mse]*. the @xmath5 are not required to be nonnegative and , since the derivation of @xmath101 is based on a jordan form , @xmath22 is not required to be diagonalizable either  @xcite .",
    "geometrically , the stability condition is that all the ( possibly complex ) numbers @xmath103 lie in the region @xmath104 of the complex plane .",
    "since @xmath101 is generally positive on the left side of the imaginary axis , we consider only the networks whose laplacian eigenvalues have nonnegative real part , which ensures that complete synchronization is possible .      for a given stability function @xmath101 , a network satisfying condition  * [ optimal ] * has the maximum rate of exponential convergence to synchronization among all networks .",
    "this is so under the assumption that there is a physical limit @xmath105 to the coupling strength of individual links , @xmath106 , and that the stability function @xmath101 is continuous and monotonically increasing with respect to the distance from the real axis , which appears to hold true for all known examples of @xmath101 in the literature  @xcite .",
    "from the limit on coupling strengths , it follows that the real part of @xmath107 is bounded by a constant @xmath108 , which , combined with the assumption on @xmath101 , implies that the exponential rate of convergence is completely determined by the value of @xmath101 in the interval @xmath109 $ ] on the real axis . in this interval",
    "@xmath101 has a global minimum at some @xmath110 , and thus @xmath111 is the maximum possible rate of exponential convergence . if the network satisfies condition  * [ optimal ] * , all perturbation eigenmodes converge at the maximum rate @xmath112 when we choose @xmath113 . in contrast , if the network violates condition  * [ optimal ] * , there must be at least one eigenvalue @xmath114 such that @xmath115 [ excluding the exceptional situation where multiple values of @xmath116 fall precisely on multiple global minima of @xmath101 ] , resulting in an eigenmode that converges at a slower rate @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , although optimal networks may suffer from initially slower convergence to synchronization that is polynomial in time @xcite , the long - term convergence rate is dominated by @xmath112 and is faster than for any other network .",

    "the ratio between the deviations in the two cases is then @xmath123 and , in particular , is less than @xmath124 for sufficiently large @xmath125 , implying that the deviation will eventually become smaller for the optimal network .",

    "this result follows from the relation @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the characteristic polynomial of the matrix @xmath22 and @xmath131 is the @xmath132 identity matrix .",

    "the first method is fast and is based on node degrees , similarly to the algorithm used in the main text for assigning negative directional interactions . in order to create negative interactions preferentially between nodes of large degrees , we first order the bidirectional links according to the product of the degrees of the two nodes connected by each link , from high to low values .",
    "going through all the links in this order , we change the strength of each bidirectional link from @xmath1 to @xmath2 if the degrees of the two adjacent nodes do not fall below a constant , chosen here arbitrarily to be 1.7 times the mean degree of the initial network .",
    "we applied this procedure to random scale - free networks with minimum degree 5 , generated by the configuration model .",

    "denoting by @xmath325 and @xmath326 the smallest and largest non - identically zero eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix @xmath22 , respectively , we measure synchronization enhancement by the relative decrease in the ratio @xmath323 , a standard measure of synchronization widely adopted for undirected networks  @xcite . figure  [ figs4]_c _ shows that our method does produce significant enhancement for @xmath97 less than about 5 ( bottom curve ) , and that the more heterogeneous the initial degree distribution ( smaller @xmath97 ) , the more effective the algorithm .",
    "the second algorithm is slower but more effective , and it is based on the observation that the largest eigenvalue @xmath326 is typically the one responsible for poor synchronizability in the undirected networks with heterogeneous degree distribution considered here  @xcite . at each step of this algorithm , we use the first - order approximation  @xcite for each bidirectional link to estimate the change in @xmath326 that would be caused by changing the strength of that link from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "we then choose a link with the largest predicted reduction in @xmath326 and make its strength @xmath2 . repeating this until the fraction of links with negative strength reaches a prescribed threshold ( chosen here arbitrarily to be 0.2 )",
    ", we obtain a sequence of candidate networks for improved synchronization here , a similar algorithm can be conceived to increase @xmath325 or to simultaneously optimize @xmath325 and @xmath326 . ] . from these networks",
    "we choose one with the smallest ratio @xmath323 as the output of the algorithm .",
    "figure  [ figs4]_b _ shows the change in the degree distribution before and after applying this algorithm to random scale - free networks with minimum degree 5 for @xmath321 and @xmath324 , generated by the configuration model . for both values of @xmath97 , we notice a significant drop in the fraction of high - degree nodes ( green arrows ) , accompanied by the appearance of nodes with degree less than the minimum degree of the initial network ( blue arrow ) .",
    "this change appears to be responsible for the reduction of @xmath323 by as much as about 65% , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figs4]_c _ ( top curve ) .",
    "note that the synchronization enhancement achieved by this method is consistently larger than the first method based on link degrees ( bottom curve ) .",

    "<S> these three expectations , however , are all false because they ignore the possibility of compensatory structural effects . for example , removing a link from a globally connected network makes it less likely to synchronize , but targeted removal of additional links can enhance synchronization @xcite . </S>",
