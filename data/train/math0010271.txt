    "we study such faces in  4 .    in  3",
    "we show that a general face of the spectral scale provides spectral information for linear combinations of the defining @xmath10 s and certain cut ",

    "a corner of a convex planar set is a point on the boundary that admits more than one tangent line of support .",
    "the natural generalization of this notion in higher dimensions is a face that admits more than one hyperplane of support , i.e. , a face of degree @xmath111 for some @xmath112 .",
    "we call such faces * sharp faces * since they generalize sharp ( i.e. , nondifferentiable ) corners on the boundary of a 2 dimensional convex set",
    ".    our main result on this topic can be described as follows . in two dimensions ,",
    "a corner of a convex set admits precisely two tangent lines of support with linearly independent normal vectors . in higher dimensions",
    ", there can be much wider variation and a new phenomenon occurs .",
    "specifically , in the case of a spectral scale formed by a single operator , a tangent line of support for a face of the spectral scale is determined by real numbers @xmath28 and @xmath38 , where @xmath113 . in the general case",
    "where there are @xmath0 @xmath10 s , the hyperplanes of the support for a sharp face are determined by a sequence @xmath114 of spectral pairs and real numbers @xmath115 .",
    "for example , suppose @xmath66 is a sharp face which is contained in hyperplanes of the form @xmath116 and @xmath117 , where the spectral pairs @xmath118 and @xmath119 are linearly independent .",
    "if @xmath120 and @xmath121 , then , just as in two dimensions , the interval @xmath122 lies in a gap in the spectrum of @xmath37 . on the other hand if @xmath123 is a linearly independent set , then something new occurs . in this case",
    ", there is a projection @xmath124 that commutes with @xmath125 and @xmath126 and such that @xmath127 if there are @xmath111 hyperplanes containing @xmath66 , with linearly independent vectors @xmath128 , then the projection @xmath124 commutes with each @xmath129 and the compression of each @xmath129 to @xmath124 is a scalar .",
    "next , we observe in  5 that if @xmath130 for the sharp face @xmath66 of the previous paragraph , then the projection @xmath124 commutes with each @xmath10 and so @xmath124 is a nontrivial central projection in @xmath12 . put colloquially , if we can `` wobble '' a sharp face in all @xmath0 `` @xmath29directions '' , then the center of @xmath12 is not trivial .  6 is devoted to showing that if @xmath8 has a countable number of extreme points , then @xmath12 is abelian .",
    "as noted in the introduction , one can `` see '' if @xmath12 is abelian from the shape of the spectral scale in the finite dimensional case , but the situation in infinite dimensions is much more complicated . in this section we present several examples that illustrate this point .",
    "other examples of the spectral scale in @xmath131 were presented in @xcite at the end of  1 .",
    "examples for which @xmath12 is finite dimensional and noncommutative appear in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we begin with an example where @xmath12 is abelian and @xmath8 has a countable number of extreme points .",
    "let @xmath53 denote the diagonal operator on @xmath132 defined by @xmath133 , and let @xmath2 be the von neumann algebra generated by @xmath53 and the identity ( so that @xmath134 ) . also , define a trace @xmath3 on @xmath2 by @xmath135 .",
    "since the spectrum of @xmath53 is exactly @xmath136 together with 0 , it is countable . by theorem 2.2",
    "the spectral scale of @xmath137 is a 2 dimensional , convex , compact set with upper boundary curve consisting of line segments with decreasing slopes  specifically the slopes @xmath136 .",

    "as the next example shows , even if @xmath12 is abelian and all linear combinations of @xmath138 have countable spectrum , @xmath8 may still have uncountably many extreme points .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath3 be as in example 1.1 and select positive real sequences @xmath139 and @xmath140 , each of which converges to 0 , and such that the sequence @xmath141 takes on every rational value between 0 and infinity . also , let @xmath142 and @xmath143 denote the corresponding diagonal operators in @xmath144 . since the two sequences converge to 0",
    ", every linear combination of @xmath142 and @xmath143 is compact . in particular",
    ", each linear combination of @xmath142 and @xmath143 has countable spectrum .    to see that @xmath8 has an uncountable number of extreme points , fix an irrational number @xmath145 , write @xmath146 and consider the operator @xmath147 . observe that @xmath148 thus , if we write @xmath149 then @xmath150 is the projection onto the subspace of @xmath151 spanned by the corresponding standard basis vectors and we have @xmath152 hence , if @xmath153 and we write @xmath154 , then @xmath155 , @xmath156 and so @xmath157    hence there are an uncountable number of spectral projections of this form and therefore by part @xmath158 of theorem 0.2 , the set of extreme points of @xmath8 is uncountable .",
    "as the next two examples show , it is not always  obvious \" from the geometry of b whether or not @xmath12 is abelian .",
    "finding a condition on @xmath8 that is necessary and sufficient for commutativity of @xmath12 is one of the major unsolved problems in the theory .",
    "the pictures of the spectral scales in these examples are rather complicated .",
    "the details are much clearer in color . to view the pictures ,",
    "go to    http://www.math.psu.edu/anderson/pictures .",
    "suppose that @xmath159 , @xmath142 is multiplication by @xmath160 , @xmath143 is the projection determined by the characteristic function of the interval @xmath161 $ ] and the trace @xmath3 is integration .",
    "thus , in this case @xmath12 is abelian .",
    "the spectral scale for these operators resembles two bed sheets , tied at their corners and billowing outwards from one another .",
    "the coinciding edges of the bed sheets form the borders of 4 two dimensional faces with parabolic boundaries that meet at the corners of the bed sheets .",
    "these faces have the same shape as the spectral scale for multiplication by @xmath160 .",
    "( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* end of  1 ) ) .",
    "thus , the spectral scale of @xmath142 is visible in @xmath8 .",
    "the spectral scale of @xmath143 ( which is just a parallelogram ) is also visible as the convex hull of the corners of the bed sheets .",
    "now let us consider a non  commutative example .",
    "put @xmath162 and write @xmath163 where @xmath164 is multiplication by @xmath160 on @xmath161 $ ] .",
    "thus , @xmath142 is still multiplication by @xmath160 on @xmath165 $ ] , but the projection @xmath143 now does not commute with @xmath142 . in this case",
    "the spectral scale is quite similar to the scale in the previous example , although the `` billowing '' of the bed sheets is more pronounced .",
    "so , based on this evidence , there does not seem to be an obvious visual method for determining when @xmath12 is abelian in the infinite dimensional case .",
    "how should one describe a face @xmath66 of a convex set @xmath80 in @xmath5 ? assuming that we have already some description of @xmath80 , it is natural to add some conditions to that description in order to distinguish the points of @xmath66 from the other points of @xmath80 .",
    "the most natural conditions , from the convexity viewpoint , should be expressed in terms of linear functionals .",
    "e.g. @xmath166 . this only works if the linear functional @xmath104 exposes the face @xmath66 .",
    "many faces are not exposed , so how can we describe them in some systematic way using linear functionals ?",
    "the answer to that question is to use more than one linear functional via the recursive process described in this section .",
    "we begin by reviewing some of the standard notions in the theory of convexity and then present some general results that will be used in the sequel .",
