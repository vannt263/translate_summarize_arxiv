    "the theory of strong interactions , qcd , contains many specific predictions regarding the space - time evolution of high energy coherent processes .",
    "a review describing the many interesting qualitative results that have been obtained in this rapidly developing field is provided in ref .",
    "the aim of this paper is to use a specific example of a completely calculable process to demonstrate the general properties of space - time evolution of hard exclusive processes in qcd . in particular",
    ", we consider a process in which a high momentum ( @xmath16 500 gev ) pion undergoes a coherent interaction with a nucleus in such a way that the final state consists of two jets ( jj ) ( formed by a @xmath0 pair ) moving at high transverse relative momentum greater than about 2 or 3 gev . the process of two - jet production was first discussed for both photon and pion projectiles interacting with a nucleon target @xcite , and ref .",
    "@xcite introduced the possibility of using this process to probe the nuclear filtering of small color dipoles .",
    "estimates of ref .",
    "@xcite found that for heavy nuclei , nuclear filtering causes the exclusive dijet production to decrease exponentially as @xmath8 increases .",
    "hence an overall increase of the total diffractive cross sections was suggested as a good signature of the nuclear filtering of small size configurations@xcite . in @xcite",
    "we presented the first application of qcd to the process of dijet production at large @xmath2 by generalizing qcd factorization theorems , predicted a nuclear dependence which is qualitatively different from that suggested in @xcite , and a @xmath2 dependence which differs by a power of @xmath8 from @xcite and qualitatively from that discussed in @xcite .",
    "we also argued that this process can be used to directly measure the behavior of the @xmath0 component of the pion s light cone wave function for large values of @xmath17 .",
    "if one wishes to describe hard diffractive processes , it is important to realize that the effective number of bare particles in the light cone wave function of the projectile depends strongly on the longitudinal distances involved . if these distances are small , and the process involves high momentum transfer , ( as occurs in computing hadron electromagnetic form factors ) the main contribution originates from the fock component of the hadron wave function containing the minimal number of constituents . on the contrary , if the longitudinal distances are sufficiently large , the minimal fock component ( a @xmath0 pair in our case ) will develop additional components such as @xmath0 pairs and gluons .",
    "thus for those processes in which infinite longitudinal distances are involved , the number of partons in the light cone wave function of the projectile would always be infinite .",
    "for processes initiated by a spatially small colorless dipole , using the qcd factorization theorem allows one to trace the origin of wee partons ( carrying a small fraction of the momenta ) as arising from the space - time evolution of the projectile s minimal fock component , and to include these effects in the ( skewed ) parton distribution of the target .",
    "we now discuss the basic physics of the dijet production process .",
    "the selection of the final state to be a @xmath0 pair plus the nuclear ground state causes the @xmath0 component of the pion wave function to dominate the reaction process . at very high beam momenta ,",
    "the pion breaks up into a @xmath0 pair with large @xmath17 well before hitting the nucleus .",
    "the dominance of this starting point is verified in the present work .",
    "note also the crucial feature that for values of @xmath18 which are not very small , so that the leading twist approximation is valid for the small dipole - target interaction , a spatially small wave packet of quarks and gluons remains small as it moves through the target .",
    "this leads to a dominance of the effects of large transverse momenta , and allows the factorization of the hard physics from the soft physics .",
    "on the other hand , for very small values of @xmath18 , the packet lives so long that it would expand to a normal hadronic size causing the initial state interaction to become similar to the soft one .",
    "moreover , a rapid increase of pqcd amplitudes with energy leads to the violation of qcd evolution equation at rather small values of @xmath18 , and to the disappearance of the characteristic physics of the interaction of a small dipole .",
    "thus qcd predicts different calculable dependencies of the cross section of the diffractive dijet production on atomic number , on @xmath2 and @xmath10 in different regions of the @xmath19 , @xmath20 plane .",
    "thus two large parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 are present , and this feature will enable us to demonstrate the dominance of feynman diagrams of a very few specific topologies , and to evaluate them . the result of calculations can be represented in the form of a generalized qcd factorization theorem , valid for the set of feynman diagrams corresponding to the leading power of @xmath21 and the minimal power of @xmath23 and @xmath3 at fixed values of @xmath24 .",
    "our calculation relies heavily on the well - known theoretical observation that amplitudes of many high energy processes ( such as that in the parton model , multi - peripheral processes and those involving the pomeron ) are dominated by ladder diagrams @xcite .",
    "this property has been proved using the approximation of including the terms of lowest order @xmath3 and all powers in @xmath25 @xcite and/or   @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the dominance of ladder diagrams makes it possible to absorb the effects of the leading terms in @xmath27 and @xmath20 into the dipole - target interaction , and/or into the target s skewed parton distributions .",
    "furthermore , one may classify and analyze those diagrams of leading power of @xmath3 which are relevant for the pion transition into two jets .",
    "this leads to a selection rule : the @xmath28-channel exchanges with vacuum quantum numbers ( positive charge parity ) should dominate .",
    "thus we will calculate an amplitude which is symmetric under the transposition @xmath29 .",
    "negative charge parity contributions ( such as effects of the odderon ) are neglected .",
    "there is another group of correction terms of the form @xmath30 which arises from radiative effects in the pion wave function .",
    "the ladder structure of the dominant diagrams makes it possible to include these terms into qcd evolution of pion wave function and structure functions of the target will not change the structure of formulas deduced by considering skeleton diagrams calculated within the approximation of keeping leading powers of @xmath3 ; their only influence is to introduce the effects of evolution in @xmath8 into the relevant parton distributions and into high @xmath31 behavior of the pion wave function . indeed , our theoretical analysis heavily relies upon specific properties of skewed parton distributions and of minimal fock component of pion wave function .",
    "note also that , for small values of @xmath18 , and large values of @xmath32 , the skewed parton distribution of a target nucleon or nucleus is calculable in qcd using the appropriate evolution equation and initial diagonal parton densities @xcite . to simplify the calculations and especially the separation of the scales , we use an axial light - cone gauge , which reduces to the @xmath33 gauge , in the target rest frame .",
    "this gives a high @xmath2 behaviour of fermion propagator and hard gluon exchange amplitude which have no infrared singularities . in this gauge ,",
    "unphysical degrees of freedom are removed from the light cone pion wave function at least within the leading log approximation .",
    "consequently , the separation of momentum scales can be easily made .",
    "on the contrary , in the gauge used in @xcite the separation of scales and therefore derivation of the qcd evolution equation , although correct , is complicated by the need to account for the cancellation of the infrared divergences .",
    "we want to stress that in the calculation of amplitudes of hard diffractive processes in the gauge where fermion propagators are infrared divergent one , should first remove infrared divergences and only then consider partons in the non - perturbative wave function to be on - mass - shell .",
    "these technical considerations lead to some simple results for situations , such as ours , in which the momentum transfer to the target nucleus is very small ( almost zero for forward scattering ) . in this case",
    ", the dominant source of high momentum must be the gluonic interactions between the pion s quark and anti - quark .",
    "this is also justified in the present work .",
    "because @xmath2 is large , the quark and anti - quark must be at small separations ",
    "the virtual state of the pion is a point - like - configuration@xcite .",
    "but the coherent interactions of a color neutral point - like configuration are suppressed ( at fixed @xmath34 , @xmath13 ) , for the processes which involve small transfers of momentum to the target , by the cancellation of gluonic emission from the quark and anti - quark @xcite and /or from the @xmath35 state .- see the discussion in the section ii.d .",
    "furthermore , the strength of the interaction with the target is proportional to the square of the transverse separation distance between the quark and anti - quark .",
    "thus the interaction with the nucleus is very rare , and the pion is most likely to interact with only one nucleon .",
    "the result is that in this process the initial @xmath36 and the final @xmath0 pair do not get absorbed by the target , as would typically occur in a low momentum transfer process .",
    "thus initial and final state interactions are suppressed and color transparency unambiguously follows . as the values of @xmath18 are decreased , the qualitative physics changes gradually .",
    "the increase of the effective size of the small color - dipole leads to the increase of the influence of initial state interactions , and to a contribution of nuclear shadowing which enters at leading twist . for even smaller values of @xmath18 ,",
    "the leading twist approximation breaks down .",
    "our treatment of the reaction process in terms of a separate wave function and interaction pieces provides a new example of how the qcd factorization theorem works for high energy processes involving two large variables : @xmath37 @xcite . for this coherent process",
    ", the forward scattering amplitude is almost proportional to the number of nucleons , @xmath38 , and the cross section varies as @xmath39 .",
    "the forward angular distribution is difficult to observe , so one integrates the angular distribution , and the @xmath39 variation becomes @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath41 is the slope of the @xmath28 dependence of the cross section of a hard diffractive process as determined by data for electroproduction of vector mesons .",
    "this very rapid variation represents a prediction of a very strong enhancement which occurs via the suppression of those interaction processes which usually reduce the cross section .",
    "our interest in this curious process has been renewed recently by exciting experimental progress @xcite .",
    "three key predictions of our paper @xcite are confirmed by the e791 data :    * the result from the e-791 experiment comparing pt and c targets that the coherent cross section for small momentum transfer to the nucleus varies as @xmath42 , is close to our predictions , see section v. this variation is much stronger than seen in soft diffraction of pions by nuclei @xmath43@xcite , which is qualitatively different from the behavior @xmath44 suggested in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this a - dependence is somewhat more rapid than that predicted by color transparency theory for @xmath45 . for moderately large values of @xmath38 , small effects discussed in sect .",
    "v tend to increase the @xmath38 dependence .",
    "this may be understood as a result of the experimental trigger not excluding a small but calculable admixture of the effects of nuclear disintegration processes which lead to similar dependence of cross section on @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , it is an unusual feature@xcite of the present process that final state interactions of the point - like configuration tend to increase the @xmath38-dependence .",
    "v also contains a discussion of the changes of the a - dependence due to the effects of nuclear shadowing on the gluon density .",
    "* the dependence of the cross section @xmath46 on the fraction of momentum @xmath10 carried by one of the jets is consistent with our prediction .",
    "* the cross section @xmath47 falls as @xmath48 with @xmath49 for @xmath50gev and as @xmath51 for @xmath52 gev .",
    "this should be compared to the prediction of @xmath53 @xcite . for smaller values of @xmath2 soft qcd phenomena , such as production of @xmath54 jets",
    ", should be important .",
    "see the discussion in sect .",
    "[ 3jets ] .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to rederive and confirm our earlier theoretical results with a more extensive analysis .",
    "the derivation of our leading term@xcite directly from qcd by generalizing a qcd factorization theorem of ref .",
    "@xcite was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , and this is explained more fully now .",
    "but here we go further by verifying the assumption that the point - like - configuration is indeed formed well before the projectile reaches the nucleus . in the derivation",
    "we shall explain that several different amplitudes , which seem to be of the same or lower order in @xmath3 as the leading one described above really are very small after proper account of the suppression of radiation collinear to pion momentum direction .",
    "we also update our study of the leading multiple - scattering correction , which is positive because the strength of the final state interaction decreases with decreasing size of the dipole @xcite , and we study the most important competing electromagnetic process .",
    "some specific features of the experimental extraction of the coherent part of the cross section are also explained .",
    "still another feature involves the soft interaction between the dipole and the target .",
    "this was at first derived to be proportional to the gluon density of the nucleus@xcite .",
    "however , there is a non - zero momentum transfer to the nucleus , so it is actually the skewed gluon density that enters .",
    "the skewedness of gluon distribution in the nuclear target leads to a small , calculable correction to the predicted a dependence @xcite and absolute value @xcite which changes the detailed nature of our results but not the qualitative features .",
    "our main results are summarized by the following formula , valid in the leading log approximation , for the differential cross section of diffractive dijet production by nuclei : @xmath55 \\frac{f_{a}(x_{1},x_{2},\\beta s , k_{1t}^2 ) } { k_1 ^ 2 k_2 ^ 2 } \\right)^2 } , \\label{unint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where by definition @xmath56 is the transverse distance between the pion s quark and anti - quark , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 can be denoted as the unintegrated skewed nuclear gluon density ) , @xmath60 are four momenta of two exchanged gluons , ( see fig .  1 ) , and @xmath61 .    here @xmath62 is the renormalization factor for the quark green function @xmath63 in the hard regime where @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",

    "the actual distances involved in the largest contributions is one of subjects investigated here",
    ".    equation  ( [ unint ] ) is derived in two steps .",
    "first we demonstrate the dominance of the feynman diagrams of fig .  1 and then evaluate these diagrams .",
    "the factorization of the hard perturbative qcd part , related to the pion wave function , and @xmath0 pair arising from softer qcd , described by skewed parton distributions ( the dominance of the diagrams of fig .",
    "1 ) is another form of the qcd factorization theorem derived in @xcite for diffractive vector meson production in deep inelastic scattering dis .",
    "the end point contribution - the feynman mechanism -(@xmath70 ) is suppressed as compared to the leading term by a set of factors : one power of @xmath71 , the square of the sudakov - type form factor , by a form factor @xmath6 ( which accounts for the very small probability to find a pion with @xmath72 and @xmath73 at _ average _ distances without a gluon field ) and by the overlap integral with final state .",
    "a detailed analysis of the end point contribution will be subject of a separate publication .",
    "it follows from qcd factorization theorems that the amplitude of hard processes can be represented as the convolution of the non - perturbative pion wave function and hard amplitude @xmath74 .",
    "the virtualities of all particles in the @xmath75 cuts of the amplitude @xmath74 are large .",

    "1 ) by analyzing different contributions of many diagrams . a more general proof will be given elsewhere . in the leading @xmath81 and @xmath82",

    "it is necessary to discuss the kinematic and dynamic limitations of our analysis .",
    "we require high beam energies so that the point - like configuration remains small as it passes through the nucleus , and we also require that @xmath2 be large enough so that the @xmath0 pair actually be in a point - like configuration .",
    "this situation corresponds to @xmath93 being held fixed for large values of @xmath8 . for the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath94 gev , and @xmath95 , so @xmath96 .",
    "there is another kinematic limit in which @xmath8 is fixed and @xmath21 goes to @xmath97 . at sufficiently small values of @xmath98 ,",
    "less than about @xmath99 the situation is very different because the @xmath0 dipole system is scattered by the collective gluon field of the nucleus .",
    "nuclear modifications ( enhancement ) of the nuclear gluon density actually occurs at larger values of @xmath98 corresponding to @xmath100 ( where @xmath101 fm is the mean inter - nucleon distance in nuclei@xcite ) .",
    "but for values such that @xmath102 the nuclear gluon field is expected to be shadowed , leading to a gradual disappearance of color transparency ( at a fixed scale ( @xmath8 ) ) .",
    "this is the onset of perturbative color opacity @xcite . at even smaller values of @xmath98",
    "a new phenomenon has been predicted  the violation of the qcd factorization theorem @xcite .",
    "our present analysis is not concerned with this region of extremely small @xmath98 .",
    "another interesting phenomenon is the possibility of probing the decomposition of quark distribution amplitude in terms of gegenbauer polynomials at sufficiently large values of @xmath8 .",
    "some general features of our analysis appear in several different sections , so it is worthwhile to discuss these here .",
    "the calculations of several amplitudes are simplified by the use of a general theorem . in the leading order in @xmath103 ,",
    "the interaction of the @xmath0 occurs via the exchange of a two - gluon ladder with the target .",
    "it is important to note that the interaction of the @xmath0 pair with the target via the exchange of a larger number of gluons is suppressed by powers of @xmath103 .",
    "the proof of this statement follows @xcite and heavily uses ward identities .",
    "( to visualize the similarity with the situation considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is instructive to neglect the effects of the odderon contribution , which is in any case small .",
    "accounting for symmetry of amplitude on the transposition : @xmath29 gives the possibility to consider the amplitude for the process @xmath104 , and to repeat the reasoning of @xcite by parametrizing the momenta of exchanged gluons along dijet total momentum . )",
    "the qcd factorization theorem @xcite predicts also that the interaction with the target via @xmath28-channel exchange by @xmath0 pair ( which is expressed in terms of the skewed quark distribution ) is not small at @xmath105 and moderate @xmath2 where gluon distribution is not large @xcite . at smaller @xmath106 and @xmath107 where the gluon distribution is large , as a result of @xmath18 and @xmath32 evolution",
    ", this term is a small correction to the exchange of the two - gluon ladder , see eq .",
    "( [ eq:1.27 ] ) .",
    "so in this paper , we shall neglect this term .",
    "the two gluons are vector particles ( bosons ) in a color singlet state , so the dominant two - gluon exchange amplitude occurs in a channel which has positive charge and spatial parity , and is therefore even under crossing symmetry . given this even amplitude , and the condition that we consider high energies @xmath108 and fixed small values of the momentum transfer @xmath28 to the target , we may use the dispersion relation over invariant energy @xmath21 at fixed @xmath28 and fixed momenta of two jets to reconstruct full amplitude via the amplitude cut over intermediate states in s and u channels . in difference from the amplitudes of hard diffractive meson production , the amplitude for dijet production may have an imaginary part which varies with @xmath109 also . at the same time , within the approximations made here , the cut amplitude coincides with the imaginary part of the full amplitude .",
    "furthermore , the relation discussed below makes it possible to reconstruct the real part of the amplitude from the imaginary part . for an amplitude corresponding to a slowly growing total cross section ( @xmath110 )",
    "the relation is @xcite = 2 [ real ] .",
    "this means that we may simply calculate the imaginary parts of any contribution to the scattering amplitude , as a function of @xmath21 and @xmath111 , with the full amplitude obtainable from eq.([real ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude , @xmath112 varies rather slowly with @xmath113 , leading to a small value of @xmath114 .",
    "thus @xmath112 dominates in the sum of diagrams .",
    "the possibility of considering only the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude simplifies the calculations enormously .",
    "the relevant intermediate states are almost on the energy - shell ( virtuality of quark , anti - quark , gluon @xmath77 ) and one can use conservation of four - momentum to relate the momentum of the relevant intermediate states to that of the initial state .",
    "there is another enormous simplification which is related to the issue of gauge invariance .",
    "the pion wave function is not gauge invariant , but the s , u cut parts of the amplitude @xmath115 , for two gluons in a color singlet state , are calculable in terms of amplitudes of sub - processes where only one gluon is off mass shell . for such amplitudes",
    "the ward identities@xcite the conservation of color current have the same form as the conservation of electromagnetic current in qed . in qed",
    "the current conservation identity has long been used to simplify calculations of high energy reactions@xcite .",
    "we will often use the ward identities@xcite to extend the qed method to treat various contributions to our process . to be able to separate soft and hard scales one need to account for the cancellation of infrared divergences introduced by using the light - cone gauge @xmath116 @xcite . instead of accounting for this cancellation as in @xcite",
    "we choose different gauges for the description of parton distributions in a nucleon , and for the amplitude pion fragmentation .",
    "this is legitimate within the region of applicability of leading log approximations . within the chosen gauge ,",
    "the hard gluon exchange amplitude and fermion propagator have no infrared divergence .",
    "note also that after demonstrating the factorization of the hard qcd amplitude from the soft qcd amplitude , we may and will approximate the soft part of the pion wave function by a system of free @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , we stress that this approximation is dangerous for evaluating the pieces of amplitudes dominated by soft physics especially if propagators contain infrared divergences . in that case",
    ", this approximation violates ward identities and the energy - momentum conservation law .",
    "additional common features arise from considering the relevant kinematics . in all of the two - gluon exchange diagrams we consider , figs .  1 - 12",
    ", the target nucleon of momentum @xmath117 emits a gluon of momentum @xmath118 and absorbs one of momentum @xmath119 .",
    "conservation of four - momentum gives k_1-k_2=p - p=p_f - p _ , in which @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the final momenta of the target and the dijet .",
    "taking the dot product of the above with @xmath122 , for the large pion beam momentum relevant here , leads to the relation : x_1-x_2=m_f^2-m_^22 p_p= m_f^2-m_^2 , [ diff1]where x_1,2,[x1x2]and where @xmath123 is the mass of the final 2jet system : @xmath124 . within the parton model approximation x_2>0 , [ x2 ] except",
    "the region of very small @xmath125 denoted the wee parton region . in the parton model",
    "this condition follows from the requirement that a parton knocked out of a nucleon should be kinematically separated from the rest of the target .",
    "otherwise the amplitude should be suppressed by a power of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this suppression disappears at sufficiently high energies for which the parton wave function of a target develops wee partons .",
    "another important consequence of the positivity of `` mass''@xmath126 of partons in intermediate states eq .",
    "( [ x2 ] ) is that the fraction @xmath11 of the pion s ( + ) momentum carried by exchanged gluons should satisfy the condition : 1>>0 , [ x3 ] for our kinematics .",
    "the restriction @xmath127 can be justified within the leading @xmath128 approximation only .",
    "the results ( [ diff1],[x2],[x3 ] ) are significant because they will be used in the evaluation of other diagrams .",
    "in particular the condition ( [ x2 ] ) is not fulfilled for the diagrams in which the transverse momenta of quarks within the pion wave function are significantly smaller than the observed transverse momenta of jets .",
    "this means that the quarks in the pion must have very high transverse momentum to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ x2 ] ) . in this case , the quarks are closely separated and we may consider the configuration to be a point - like configuration . such a restriction is operative in the kinematics for which the target wave function has no wee partons , i.e. for sufficiently large @xmath98 . on the contrary , for sufficiently small values of @xmath98 , the sign of @xmath125 becomes unimportant because the amplitude does not depend on the sign of wee parton momentum .",
    "it is also worth emphasizing that the dominance of small size configurations in the projectile pion , so important to our analysis , is closely related to the renormalizable nature of qcd .",
    "this renormalizability implies , as extensively discussed below , that the selection of large transverse momentum final - state jets leads to a selection of the large transverse momenta of the quarks in the pion wave function , and also to some increase of transverse momenta of the exchanged gluons .",
    "one also needs to realize that the emissions in the in - state and absorptions in the out - state combine in calculating the usual parton density to produce the renormalized parton density .",
    "thus it is necessary to guarantee suppression of gluon radiation collinear to the pion direction in the initial , intermediate , and final states .",
    "otherwise an exclusive process will be additionally suppressed by powers of the sudakov type form factor .",
    "this is a stringent condition which suppresses the contribution of all other diagrams except that of fig .  1 because for small values of @xmath98 , the time and longitudinal distance intervals ( @xmath129 ) are easily long enough to accommodate the radiation of a gluon .",
    "if a pion is in a spatially small quark - gluon component , collinear radiation is suppressed because color is highly localized in the plane transverse to the pion momentum . as a result ( similar to the case of meson production by longitudinally",
    "polarized photons ) there is no sudakov form factor type suppression for such processes @xcite . note also that according to the qcd factorization theorem a pion in a small size configuration consists of @xmath0 pair accompanied by a coherent , relatively soft gluon field which follows the valence quarks without violation of coherence .",
    "this gluon field is included in the skewed gluon distribution .",
    "consider now the impact of the above - mentioned condition for the interactions of a pion in a large size @xmath0 configuration .",
    "the @xmath72 , @xmath73 and gluons which start off far apart must end up with a q@xmath73 pair close together in a final state without collinearly moving gluons . in this case , the @xmath72 and @xmath73 must undergo a high momentum transfer without emitting gluons collinear to the pion direction .",
    "but such processes are well known to be exponentially suppressed by double logarithmic sudakov - type form factors . only in the case of a compact @xmath0 pair , of a transverse size commensurate with the virtuality of a gluon bremsstrahlung",
    ", would the gluon radiation be small . a related suppression , evaluated in sect .",
    "iii is the very small probability @xmath6 of finding a pion with @xmath72 and @xmath73 at _ average _ distances without a gluon field , if the probe has a resolution @xmath130 .",
    "note that under these conditions , in the typical parton configuration , gluons are experimentally observed to carry about @xmath131 of the pion momentum .",
    "another example is pion scattering by a high momentum gluon field of a target . in the intermediate state",
    "there should be a strong collinear radiation along the pion direction because the color charge strongly changes its direction of motion , and there is no color charge nearby to compensate for this emission .",
    "this is similar to the effect of filling a gap in the case of color unconnected hard processes like higgs production via @xmath132 in hadron - hadron collisions @xcite .    in considering hard exclusive processes",
    ", one needs to address the problem of the end point contributions  the so called feynman mechanism .",
    "we find that due to the color neutrality of the pion and the effect of target recoil , the amplitude for this mechanism is suppressed by a factor @xmath133 as compared with that of the perturbative qcd mechanism .",
    "the contribution of the feynman mechanism is also suppressed by powers of the sudakov - type form factor and by the form factor @xmath6 .    in previous papers@xcite",
    "we have emphasized that the amplitude we computed in 1993 is calculable using perturbative qcd .",
    "however , there are five other types of contributions which occur at the same order of @xmath3 .",

    "another contribution to @xmath136 arises from the sum of feynman diagrams in which the gluon exchange between the @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the beam occurs during the interaction with the target , see figs .  8 ,  9 , and 10 .",
    "the naive expectation is that such terms , which amount to having a gluon exchanged during the very short interaction time characteristic of the two gluon exchange process occurring at high energies , must be very small indeed .",
    "the intent of this sub - section is to use the analytic properties of the scattering amplitude to show that @xmath136 is negligible .",

    "this suppression is the only way to resolve an evident contradiction : the kinematic restriction on the final state discussed above forbids radiation collinear to the pion momentum , but such radiation naturally arises in a hard collision , or from the presence of a significant gluon admixture in the non - perturbative pion wave function when nonperturbative q@xmath73 and more complicated configurations propagate large and increasing with energy longitudinal distances .",
    "it is convenient to represent this suppression as a product of two factors : @xmath341 . the first factor accounts for the well understood suppression of the collinear initial state radiation in the scattering of a target gluon off a low @xmath31 quark . remember that by definition a non - perturbative pion wave function does not include a pqcd high momentum tail .",

    "we restrict ourselves by the contribution of diagrams enhanced by the large factor @xmath2 from the vertex of quark(antiquark)- photon interaction .",
    "dominance of photon interaction with external quark lines in the pion fragmentation into 2 jets is another form of the qcd factorization theorem which properly accounts for the conservation of the e.m .",
    "current and the gauge invariance of qcd . on the contrary @xcite interacting particles",
    "are put on mass shell before the separation of scales and the cancellations between different photon attachments has been taken into account .",
    "these approximations have problems with the conservation of the e.m.current and the renormalization group in qcd .",
    "the ratio of electromagnetic and strong amplitudes is given by @xmath540 using @xmath541 gev@xmath126 ( the smallest value measured in @xcite z / a=1/2 , @xmath542 gev , @xmath543 ( this is 1/4 of the value of ref .",

    "we may safely ignore this effect for the energy range of ref .",
    "@xcite , or any contemplated fixed target experiment . at collider energies",
    ", it will be possible to measure jets of much larger values of transverse momentum , so any complete theoretical analysis should account for this electromagnetic interaction .    for a heavy nuclei target another electromagnetic process @xmath544 in the amplitude",
    "gives a contribution .",
    "this is a dijet production due to the two - photon exchange , a version of fig .  8 in which the exchanged gluons are replaced by exchanged photons . for small transverse momenta of quarks @xmath545 in the pion wave function ,",
    "this contribution is suppressed as the power of @xmath21 in the amplitude .",
    "this is because , in the calculation of the imaginary part of the diagram , @xmath546 for the exchanged photon is given by @xmath547 except for a very narrow region of @xmath10 near @xmath548 , which is suppressed by the decrease of the pion wave function .",
    "thus @xmath549 and according to our previous arguments , this contribution should be very small . for large @xmath346 this contribution may also be expressed in terms of the same pion wave function as in the case of the two - gluon exchange .",
    "it is easy to estimate this em amplitude obtained from the two - photon exchange : @xmath550 here @xmath551 is electric charge of quark ( anti - quark ) in the units of the electric charge of electron .",
    "the lower limit of integration over @xmath281 is @xmath552 thus the contribution of this term to the cross section should have the same @xmath10 and @xmath294 dependence as the two - gluon exchange term , but with a much faster z dependence ( @xmath553 ) .",
    "this term is negligible also .",
    "the use of the experimentally measured @xcite value of @xmath554 ( recall eq .",
    "( [ param ] ) ) leads to    @xmath555    the typical usual nuclear dependence of the soft diffractive processes observed in the high energy processes is @xmath556 or @xmath557 .",
    "the use of a glauber approximation with a typical hadronic cross section for the final system tends to predict the a dependence as @xmath558 .",
    "an account of color fluctuations @xcite predicts @xmath556 , in agreement with the fnal data @xcite which would give    @xmath559    thus color transparency causes a factor of 10 enhancement !",
    "this seems to be the huge effect of color transparency that many of us have been hoping to find .",
    "it is also true that , as noted in the introduction , that the @xmath2 and @xmath10 dependence of the cross section @xcite is in accord with our prediction .",
    "all of this looks very good , but it is necessary to provide some words of caution .",
    "our analysis was related to a nuclear coherent process involving a @xmath0 final state .",
    "if the experimental signal is significantly contaminated by incoherent nuclear effects or by @xmath54 final states , our analysis might not be applicable .",
    "however , the experimental @xcite extraction of the coherent peak using the @xmath509 dependence of the amplitude , and the measurement of the two - jet ( as opposed to three - jet ) cross section seem very secure to us , except for the small correction discussed in sect .",
    "v. another worry is that the color transparency effect seen in ref .",
    "@xcite seems to start for values of @xmath1 near 1 gev .",
    "these are lower than suggested in ref .",
    "these earlier predictions used modeling of non - perturbative effects , and such modeling may be necessary to guess the lowest values of @xmath2 for which color transparency would occur . the reasoning of the present paper uses perturbative qcd , which becomes more reliable as @xmath2 increases",
    "this is because the competing amplitudes @xmath560 are decreased relative to @xmath80 by a factor of @xmath142 ( @xmath561 for @xmath562 gev ) or @xmath563 .",
    "a coherent sum of the sub - dominant amplitudes could provide a significant correction to our dominant pure amplitude .",
    "however , the observed falloff of the cross section with @xmath2 , combined with the @xmath10 and @xmath38 dependence , does provide very strong evidence for color transparency .",
    "it is worth noting similarities and differences between the process we discuss in this paper and another factorizable process , that of hard exclusive electroproduction of mesons @xcite .",
    "both processes allow a simple geometric interpretation in the transverse coordinate representation : a convolution of the initial wave short - distance wave function , @xmath564 , the dipole - target cross section , @xmath565 , and the final wave function @xmath566 .",
    "however , in the case of the vector meson production , the @xmath32 dependence of the longitudinal photon wave function at small @xmath426 causes the final vector meson wave function to be evaluated at @xmath567 . in the case of the pion dijet diffraction",
    "the pion wave function enters at small values of @xmath568 .",
    "if color transparency has been correctly observed in the @xmath569 ( ground state ) , there would be many implications .",
    "the spectacular enhancement of the cross section would be a novel effect .",
    "the point - like configurations would be proved to exist .",
    "this would be one more verification of the concept and implications of the idea of color .",
    "furthermore , the definitive proof of the existence of color transparency means that we now have available a new effective tool to investigate microscopic hadron , nuclear structure at hundreds of gev energy range . at lower energies of a ten s of gev color transparency is masked to some extent by the diffusion of a spatially small quark - gluon wave package to the normal hadronic size @xcite .",
    "still it is possible that previous experiments @xcite showing hints @xcite of color transparency ( for a review see ref  @xcite ) probably do show color transparency .",
    "efforts @xcite to observe color transparency at jefferson laboratory , and at hermes(desy ) should be increased .",
    "the electron - ion collider would provide numerous possibilities for studying color transparency both in di- , tri - jet coherent production as well as in exclusive processes .",
    "the observation of ct confirms the idea that the life span of the perturbative phase can be increased by the large lorentz factor associated with high energy beams . a challenging problem would be to explore this idea to observe the perturbative phase in a `` macroscopic '' volume .",
    "one manifestation of this would be the production of huge blob  like configurations of huskyons @xcite .",
    "these different configurations have wildly different interactions with a nucleus @xcite , so that the nucleon in the nucleus can be very different from a free nucleon .",
    "more generally , the idea that a nucleon is a composite object is emphasized by these findings .",
    "some configurations of the nucleon interact very strongly with the surrounding nucleons ; some interact very weakly .",
    "this means that the nucleon in the nucleus can be very different from a free nucleon .",
    "this leads to an entirely new view of the nucleus , one in which the nucleus is made out of oscillating , pulsating , vibrating , color singlet , composite objects .",
    "the technical purpose of this paper has been to show how to apply leading - order perturbative qcd to computing the scattering amplitude for the coherent processes : @xmath570 and @xmath571 .",
    "the high momentum component of the pion wave function , computable in perturbation theory , is an essential element of the amplitude .",
    "the dominance of the amplitude of the @xmath80 term of eq .",
    "( [ t1r ] ) is obtained by showing that the corrections to it , which at first glance seem to be of the same order in the coupling constant , are vanishingly small .",
    "this vanishing , obtained using arguments based on analyticity , causality , and current conservation , is equivalent to the verification of a specific space - time description of the event : the pion produces its point - like component at distances well before the target .",
    "furthermore , for the conditions of the experiment @xcite studied here , the competing electromagnetic production process is shown to yield a negligible effect .",
    "it seems that perturbative qcd can be applied to the coherent nuclear production of high - relative momentum dijets by high energy pions .",
    "it therefore seems interesting to consider similar reactions involving other projectiles such as photons , kaons , and protons .",
    "the observations of the coherent photoproduction of the @xmath572 from nuclear targets has long been known@xcite to have an a dependence which is very similar to that observed here , but the authors of @xcite did not interpret it as color transparency phenomenon .",
    "later on h1 and zeus detectors at hera investigated exclusive photoproduction of the @xmath573 meson from a proton target .",
    "the striking qualitative predictions for this process based on the qcd factorization theorem , such as energy and t dependence , are in accordance with the data ; for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "thus now there exist serious reasons to believe that color transparency phenomenon has been observed in the combination of coherent photoproduction of @xmath572 from nuclei(fnal ) and from the nucleon ( hera ) .",
    "our present theory can be used for kaon projectiles with little modification . because the kaon has a smaller size than the pion",
    ", we expect that the amplitude for a kaon - induced process should be somewhat larger than that of the pion induced process discussed here . the same analysis should be applicable to the photoproduction of high @xmath2 @xmath175 pair of light quarks .",
    "it is important here that the contribution of bare photon coupling to the @xmath0 is proportional to quark s bare mass and is negligible for forward scattering @xcite .",
    "the contribution of a target gluon with @xmath574 discussed in @xcite is suppressed by sudakov and @xmath6 form factors discussed above .",
    "however , the pqcd physics of light quarks will be masked to some extent by another striking prediction of qcd , which is the enhancement of the diffractive production of charmed dijets because of a large bare mass of charmed quarks .",
    "the study of high energy coherent production of jet systems from nuclear targets seems to be a very productive way to investigate both perturbative qcd and microscopic nuclear structure by exploring the diverse effects of color transparency .",
    "such studies in the region of hundreds of gev seem ideally suited for the non - destructive investigation of a microscopic hadron , and nuclear structure",
    ". it may be possible to remove a piece of hadron ( @xmath0 pair .. ) or to implant ( strangeness in the center of a nucleus ... ) without destruction of a target .",
    "such investigations resemble modern methods of surgery which avoid cutting muscles .",
    "so it seems appropriate to name this new field of investigations as micro - surgery of a hadron , or of a nucleus .",
