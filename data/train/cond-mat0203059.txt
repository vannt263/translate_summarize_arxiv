    "the potential may be written as    @xmath32    for @xmath33 , this potential is an asymmetric well , with different limiting value of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",

    "one may distinguish situations between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "in the former case , there is a discrete part in the energy spectrum as well as a continuous one , while the latter leads to only continuous part .",
    "the solution@xcite is as follows .",

    "thus there is discrete part if    @xmath51    the continuous spectrum may be divided into two parts . for    @xmath52",
    "the energy is given by    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the momentum in @xmath42 direction , @xmath55 .",
    "the corresponding wavefunction is    @xmath56    with    @xmath57 @xmath58 this wavefunction vanishes exponentially for @xmath59 when @xmath60 , and bounded from above when @xmath61 . for @xmath62 ,",
    "the opposite is true .",
    "the inequality ( [ ec1 ] ) is equivalent to    @xmath63    if the parameters are such that the inequality ( [ ce2 ] ) is replaced by    @xmath64    then there is another type of continuous energy spectrum .",
    "the wavefunctions are nonvanishing but bounded as @xmath65 .",
    "they describe overbarrier motion .",
    "the energy is still given by eq.([ener ] ) , but the corresponding wavefunctions are    @xmath66    where    @xmath67    the above results are valid for @xmath39 . when @xmath40 , an analytical continuation can be performed@xcite . and",
    "it was found that there is no discrete part in the spectrum , the wavefunctions and energy are of the same form as that for @xmath39 , but now valid for this region of parameters .",
    "in the weak inhomogeneity limit @xmath68 where @xmath18 is the linear size of the sample , @xmath69 for not very weak field . then the potential well ( given by eq.([pot2 ] ) ) is deep enough to host many discrete levels , which are reminiscence of the landau levels .",
    "recall that low energy states dominate in the cooperon propagator , the continuous part(with energies higher than the barrier height ) gives negligible contribution , thus only the discrete part of the spectrum is important in the cooperon .",
    "it can be shown that in this limit , inhomogeneity brings a correction of order @xmath70 to the usual uniform field weak - localization magnetoresistance .",
    "and the dephasing time has the same form with the situation of a uniform field .",
    "the opposite limit , @xmath71 , which we will focus on , is more interesting .    assuming the field described by eq.([field ] ) can be realized in experiment , let s show that for realistic parameters it is possible to have the discrete part of the spectrum absent in the strong inhomogeneity limit . for @xmath72 , @xmath73 if @xmath3 is in tesla , thus up to @xmath74 , one can take @xmath75 as a small quantity",
    ". then we check if the discrete part of the spectrum exists in this limit .",
    "the criterion for its existence is @xmath76 .",
    "since @xmath77 , one has @xmath78 . for a system with @xmath79",
    ", this gives @xmath80 .",
    "thus the inequality for the existence of discrete levels does not hold in this situation .",
    "one therefore concludes there is no discrete part in the spectrum . in this limit ,",
    "@xmath81,\\ ] ]    and the cooperon propagator is    @xmath82 } ,   \\label{coop}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the integral should be done under the constraint    @xmath83 \\ll 1,\\ ] ]    or    @xmath84    as it is a condition for the perturbation theory .",
    "before proceeding , we need to discuss the boundary condition .",
    "if we use the wavefunctions eq.([wf1 ] ) and ( [ wf2 ] ) in their present form , then the cooperon propagator constructed naively in eq.([coop ] ) does not satisfy the zero amplitude boundary condition    @xmath85    the boundary condition in @xmath86 direction can be taken care of in the same way as in the uniform field case , where the plane wave wavefunctions are replaced by their linear combinations , and @xmath87 takes only some discrete allowed values .",
    "the boundary condition in the @xmath42 direction can be dealt with in the same manner .",
    "we note that from eq.([ener ] ) , the eigenstates with @xmath54 and @xmath88 are degenerate , thus a linear combination of them is also an eigenstate .",
    "the new eigenstate can be constructed as    @xmath89    which are required to satisfy the boundary condition    @xmath90    as in the case of uniform field , only some discrete @xmath91 will be allowed .",
    "thus the continuous part of the spectrum becomes again discrete in this boundary condition .",
    "the integration over momentum will be replaced by summation over these discrete allowed values .",
    "we note that the dispersion relation is not altered in the construction eq.([cons ] ) .    introducing the dimensionless momenta @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and going to time domain",
    ", we find    @xmath96(t'-t)\\right\\ } \\label{coop2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99(t'-t)\\right\\}.\\ ] ] we see that the magnetic field results in a characteristic time scale beyond which the cooperoon propagator or the interference effect is no longer important . therefore    @xmath100    which leads to eq.([dep2 ] ) .",
    "thus the dephasing rate depends quadratically on the field amplitude in the strong inhomogeneity limit . in this calculation",
    ", we see that the dependence of @xmath101 on @xmath3 is a result of the nature of corresponding single particle motion . from eq.([pot2 ] ) , when @xmath75 is large , the potential well is deep enough to accommodate many bound states with discrete levels(which are reminiscence of landau levels ) .",
    "dominant contribution to the cooperon is from these low lying levels which results in linear dependence .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath75 is small , the potential well can be so shallow that discrete level does not appear , and the particle executes overbarrier motion which is nearly free with continuous spectrum .",
    "when this part of spectrum is dominant in the cooperon , the dephasing rate is a quadratic function of the field amplitude .",
    "the quadratic dependence implies that the electrons are more slowly dephased compared with in the uniform field case , where the dependence is linear .",
    "physically this is because for a given diffusion time , electrons in this regime can visit a larger area than the constrained motion . since the magnetic field is nonzero only in a limited region , the phase change accumulated during this time is smaller than that of the uniform case .",
    "so the electron has to wander for a longer time before it gets dephased .",
    "therefore the constrained motion of single particle leads to linear dephasing rate dependence on field amplitude , and nearly free overbarrier motion to quadratic .",
    "eq.([dep2 ] ) is obtained in the limit of small @xmath75 , which may be realized with tiny @xmath1 and small @xmath3 .",
    "more realistic for experimental observation is situation with moderate @xmath1 . in this case",
    ", one expects a crossover from the linear(uniform limit ) to quadratic(inhomogeneity limit ) dependence .",
    "this point can be illustrated in the following way .",
    "consider the electron which has diffused for a time @xmath102 .",
    "if @xmath103 , the inhomogeneity is not noticed by the electron .",
    "if during this time the electron has already been dephased , @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the dephasing time in the uniform field(given by eq.([dep1 ] ) ) , then the inhomogeneity is not important at all .",
    "when @xmath102 is beyond this time scale , the inhomogeneity effect enters .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath1 , there is a crossover field implied by    @xmath106    which yields    @xmath107    this is equivalent to saying that the inhomogeneity effect enters when @xmath108 .    on the other hand , if we can adjust the width @xmath1 , then for a given @xmath3 , there is a crossover length scale @xmath109 ,    @xmath110    which is the magnetic length for a uniform field .",
    "in passing on , let s mention that from eq.([coop2 ] ) , one can see that the magnetoconductance is proportional to @xmath111 in this small @xmath75 limit . in the large @xmath75 limit",
    ", a logarithmic dependence is expected as in the uniform field case .",
    "these can also be established by qualitative argument of khmelnitskii@xcite .",
    "a monte carlo algorithm has been developed to simulate the dephasing process . in order to be consistent with",
    "that implied by eq . ( 1 ) , the simulations will be semiclassical in nature .",
    "trajectories will be used and the only quantum mechanical effect will be in the phases . in this approach ,",
    "a particle performs random walk in a square lattice .",
    "the value of the perpendicular field is assigned to a dual lattice .",
    "we trace all the closed loops that are formed .",
    "once a loop is formed , all the inner points are picked up(for technical details , see [ 17 ] ) , and we calculate and record the phase change @xmath112 due to this loop",
    ". then the trajectory of this loop is erased , and the particle continues the random walk .",
    "the phase accumulated this way is    @xmath113    whose average is zero since the loop has equal possibility to be clockwise and counter - clockwise .",
    "then    @xmath114    the random walk stops as soon as    @xmath115    and we specify the time(total number of random walk steps ) that has been spent to reach this as the dephasing time .",
    "an ensemble of such walks are performed and the dephasing time is averaged . in the simulations , the mean free path @xmath116 and the flux quantum @xmath117 have been set to 1 , so that    @xmath118    where @xmath119 runs over all the inner points in the dual lattice of loop @xmath120 .",
    "several features make this simulation of qualitative nature .",
    "first , the criterion eq.([cri ] ) is a qualitative one .",
    "secondly , in the simulation , the impurities are assumed to be on regular lattice sites , with the mean free path as lattice constant .",
    "thirdly , sometimes we choose the field not necessarily the original one , but qualitatively the same .",
    "however , essential physics is not lost despite of its qualitative nature , and this simulation is very efficient in uncovering _ dependence _ of the dephasing time on the field amplitude , which is particularly appropriate for situations where the field modulation is complicated so that it is difficult to make progress with analytical approaches .    as a check of the algorithm",
    ", we have simulated the uniform field case .",
    "excellent linearity in the plot of dephasing rate against @xmath3 is observed , in agreement with eq.([dep1 ] ) . for comparison with the modulated field we studied in the previous section ,",
    "the simulation is performed with the following field    @xmath121    which is qualitatively the same as eq.(1 ) .",
    "the results plotted in fig.([fig1 ] ) show a clear linear dependence for large @xmath1 , and a crossover from linear to quadratic dependence for moderate @xmath1 .",
    "the boundary is set at @xmath122 in this simulation .",
    "trajectories which touch the boundary are excluded .",
    "the results are obtained by averaging over @xmath123 random walks .",
    "when the inhomogeneity effect enters , fluctuations become significant in the result .",
    "this is because there are extreme trajectories that wander for a long time in the zero field region .",
    "however , by recording not only the average but also the standard deviation , we are able to get an estimation @xmath124 for the exponent in the inhomogeneous limit , in agreement with eq.([dep2 ] ) . thus the numerics support analytical results .",
    "the qualitative feature of the results , linear dependence in weak inhomogeneity limit and quadratic in strong inhomogeneity limit , may be more general .",
    "consider the situation with magnetic field modulated periodically in one direction with zero mean .",
    "while the weak inhomogeneity limit is easy to understand , we shall focus on the opposite limit to discuss possible quadratic dependence of @xmath125 on @xmath3 .    assume the magnetic - field profile is such that nearest neighbor stripes of width @xmath1 have the same magnitude but opposite sign .",
    "consider the phase change of a closed loop due to this magnetic field . since the field is periodic with zero mean ,",
    "what is important for the magnetic flux is the ratio of linear size of the loop with the width of one stripe , @xmath126 .",
    "if this ratio is an even integer , then the net flux is zero . if it is an odd integer , then the flux is equal to that piercing through a single stripe . in general this ratio",
    "may fluctuates , however it is clear that the average flux is proportional to @xmath127 .",
    "demanding the phase change due to this flux to be 1 , one obtains eq.([dep2 ] ) , with probably an additional numerical coefficient .    for a general magnetic field periodic in one direction ,",
    "the corresponding schr@xmath12dinger equation is often difficult to solve analytically .",
    "for example , for @xmath128 , one can choose @xmath129 .",
    "then the resulting schr@xmath12dinger equation is a whittaker - hill equation whose solution may be reduced to three - term recurrence relations@xcite , but an explicit analytical result for the spectrum is not known",
    ". however some insight can be gained by analyzing the structure of energy spectrum . in general , if the magnetic field is @xmath130 , in the landau gauge @xmath131 . separating variables in the wavefunction , the electron motion in @xmath42 direction",
    "is described by a schr@xmath12dinger equation with potential    @xmath132 ^ 2,\\ ] ]    which is also a periodic function . for given @xmath87 , this potential is bounded from above as that described by eq.([pot2 ] ) .",
    "the profile of this potential is a series of potential wells joining with each other .",
    "the energy spectra of electrons in a family of such modulated magnetic fields are calculated by ibrahim and peeters@xcite . for electron energy",
    "less than the barrier height , the wavefunctions in neighboring wells overlap and spread .",
    "so the discrete levels in single wells now form minibands due to the periodic structure .",
    "when @xmath3 and @xmath1 are large , the barrier can be quite high , and states in these minibands dominate in the cooperon propagator . according to the experience in dealing with the previous case , the dephasing rate is expected to be a linear function of @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath3 and @xmath1 are small , however , the potential well is not deep enough to support these minibands , and dominant contribution is expected from nearly free overbarrier motion , which leads to a quadratic dependence .    to examine these considerations ,",
    "computer simulations are performed for the following field    @xmath133    the results are shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the curves show much resemblance to that in fig.[fig1 ] , and a crossover from linear to quadratic dependence is evident .",
    "there are also some differences which will be noted here .",
    "first , for a given @xmath1 , the crossover field @xmath134 is smaller in the field ( [ fdq2 ] ) than in ( [ fdq1 ] ) , which suggests when @xmath3 is small , electron in the field ( [ fdq2 ] ) is more quickly dephased than in the field ( [ fdq1 ] ) .",
    "this may look strange at first sight , since the field ( [ fdq2 ] ) has zero mean , one may expect the electrons in this field are more slowly dephased .",
    "however , this result can be understood by noticing what enters is the variance of the phase instead of the average , and the field ( [ fdq2 ] ) is nonzero everywhere in the plane .",
    "another difference is in the field ( [ fdq2 ] ) there is broader crossover region .",
    "this is associated with the fact that , in the periodic situation , states with energy lower than the barrier height are not really bound states .",
    "they share some feature of the plane waves according to bloch s theorem . as discussed previously , this feature has the tendency of leading to a quadratic dependence .",
    "when @xmath1 is moderate , the barrier is not very high for many values of @xmath87",
    ". then these states can be dominant in the cooperon , resulting in a broad crossover region .",
    "= 7.25 cm    numerical experiments are also performed for situations with some other magnetic field modulations , for example , that with circular symmetry , or periodic in both directions .",
    "similar crossover behaviors have been observed .",
    "these simulations as well as the qualitative understanding of the origin of the dependences , suggest that the crossover from a linear to quadratic dependence in the dephasing rate on field amplitude can be quite general . for situations where the corresponding single particle potential is bounded from above , the particle motion can exhibit both bound and free nature , leading to a crossover from linear to quadratic dependence .",
    "we have studied the dephasing time of disordered two - dimensional electron gas in modulated magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "it is shown that in the weak inhomogeneity limit , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the linear size of the sample , @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "this happens when the bound states with discrete spectrum of the corresponding schr@xmath12dinger equation dominate in the cooperon propagator .",
    "while in the strong inhomogeneity limit , the dependence is quadratic @xmath135 . in this case ,",
    "the nearly free overbarrier motion gives dominant contribution to cooperon . in the intermediate regime ,",
    "a crossover between these two limiting situations occurs at @xmath136 .",
