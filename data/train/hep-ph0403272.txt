    "the executed experiments of the neutrino oscillation have made it certain that the neutrinos have the very small , but finite masses @xcite .",
    "the recent kamland experiment gave us the more precise information about the neutrino mass matrix @xcite .",
    "although the neutrino oscillation experiments are not able to determine the magnitudes themselves of the neutrino masses , the recent results of wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) imposed the upper bound of the sum of the neutrino masses @xcite . since the neutrinos have no masses in the standard model , it is an urgent issue that we extend the standard model and build the model where the neutrinos naturally have the very small masses in comparison with the other leptons and quarks .",
    "it is expected that the smallness of the neutrino masses is explained by the majorana type mass , which only neutrinos among quarks and leptons are able to have .",
    "the majorana mass terms have the noticeable feature that they violate the lepton number , which is conserved at the tree level in the standard model",
    ". a few types of models of the majorana neutrinos are proposed .",
    "the seesaw model @xcite , the @xmath0 triplet higgs model @xcite , and the zee model @xcite are the three typical models where the standard model is minimally extended to induce the majorana masses of the neutrinos within the framework of the @xmath2 gauge theory .",
    "in this paper we focus on the @xmath0 triplet higgs model .",
    "especially , we introduce the model which is built in the framework of the large extra dimension and can naturally explain the smallness of the neutrino masses by the `` shining '' mechanism @xcite .",
    "we live in one brane and the lepton number is violated in the distant other brane .",
    "a messenger field informs us of the lepton number violation in the other brane .",
    "since the messenger field spreads out in the extra dimensions , the density of the field is diluted , which is called the `` shining '' mechanism .",
    "since we are informed of the only tiny lepton number violation , the very small neutrino masses are naturally induced in our brane .",
    "furthermore , based on the t hooft s naturalness condition , the tiny lepton number violation , that is , the very small neutrino mass , is stabilized under the quantum corrections . in this paper",
    "we adopt the 4-dimensional effective theory in our brane of the @xmath0 triplet higgs model in the large extra dimension .",
    "it is also noticed that the @xmath0 triplet higgs model must not induce the dangerous pseudo majoron which is inconsistent with the accelerator experiments as the cern lep , and the model is constrained from the observation of the @xmath1 parameter in the lep @xcite .",
    "the lepton flavor violation in this model is analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the baryon number in the present universe is well known to be @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the baryon number density and @xmath5 is the entropy density .",
    "some scenarios where the baryon number is dynamically generated from vanishing initial baryon number , @xmath6 , are proposed .",
    "the gut scenario @xcite , the electroweak scenario @xcite , the fukugita - yanagida scenario @xcite , and the affleck - dine scenario @xcite are proposed as the typical scenarios of the baryogenesis .",
    "the gut and electroweak scenarios have already been almost ruled out .",
    "it is often mentioned that these scenarios of the baryogenesis have a double - edged behaver , that is , the scenarios of the baryogenesis simultaneously have a potential to erase the existing baryon number .",
    "especially , while the mass models of the majorana neutrinos have a potential to generate the baryon number through the leptogenesis as in the fukugita - yanagida scenario , these models simultaneously have a potential to erase arbitrary initial lepton and therefore baryon numbers .",
    "there exist the sphaleron - anomaly processes which create and annihilate the baryon in an equal amount as that of the lepton in the standard model @xcite .",
    "when the the sphaleron - anomaly processes and the lepton number violating processes in the mass models of the majorana neutrinos are simultaneously in equilibrium , the arbitrary initial baryon and lepton numbers are actually washed out . since the sphaleron - anomaly processes are in equilibrium at the large region of temperature between 100 gev and @xmath7 gev , whether the lepton number violating processes are in equilibrium or not in the region handles the fate of the cosmological baryon number .",
    "in this paper , we assume that the primordial baryon number is generated by some unknown mechanism at the very early universe and require that the primordial baryon number is not washed out in the mass models of the majorana neutrinos where the baryon number is never generated .",
    "the situation where the baryon number is never generated via leptogenesis in the majorana mass models is typically realized when we assume that the lepton sector has no cp violation because of the sakharov s three conditions @xcite .",
    "although we assume no cp violation in the following analyses , the results of this paper are valid as long as the mass models of the majorana neutrinos are not able to generate the present baryon number .",
    "actually , it is shown that even if the @xmath0 triplet higgs model , which we use in this paper , has cp violation in the lepton sector , the baryon number can not be generated @xcite .",
    "the leptogenesis in the other extended triplet higgs models is analyzed in @xcite . in order to generate the baryon number via leptogenesis",
    ", two triplet higgs fields must be introduced .",
    "the similar analyses are carried out in the gut scenario @xcite and in the fukugita - yanagida scenario @xcite .    in order to escape from washing out of the baryon number in the mass models of the majorana neutrinos ,",
    "it is necessary that the lepton number violating processes are out of equilibrium .",
    "an out - of - equilibrium process means that the reaction rate of a process is smaller than the hubble parameter at that time . in order to violate the lepton number explicitly in the @xmath0 triplet higgs model ,",
    "two kinds of interactions must be newly introduced . at first sight , it is not clear whether both of the two kinds of interactions must be out of equilibrium or either of the two kinds of interactions must be out of equilibrium in order to protect the primordial baryon number .",
    "the answer we obtain in this paper is that if either of the two kinds of interactions is out of equilibrium , the primordial baryon number is not washed out .",
    "if either of the two kinds of interactions is out of equilibrium , the lepton number is considered not to be explicitly broken and an approximately preserved global @xmath8 charge which contains the lepton number exists . thus the primordial baryon number is protected in proportion to the initial value of the approximate @xmath8 charge .",
    "it is the first purpose in this paper that we can concretely estimate the condition to protect the primordial baryon number by solving the boltzmann equation in the @xmath0 triplet higgs model .",
    "we next analyze whether the @xmath0 triplet higgs model can simultaneously satisfy the obtained condition to protect baryon number and the results of the neutrino oscillation experiments or not .",
    "we further require that the model satisfies the results of wmap and the constraints on the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "it is the second purpose in this paper that we require that the model satisfies all the above conditions and obtain the allowed region of the parameters in the model .",
    "the similar analyses are carried out in the seesaw model @xcite and in the zee model @xcite .",

    "when the neutral triplet higgs field @xmath21 gets the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , the interactions in ( [ lld ] ) , whose mass dimension is four , induce the majorana mass terms of the neutrinos , which explicitly violate the lepton number .",
    "however when we assign the triplet higgs fields with the lepton number @xmath22 , none of the interactions in the model violate the lepton number at the symmetric phase where the neutral triplet higgs field has no vev , that is , the lepton number is not explicitly violated .",
    "in the broken phase , neutrinos acquire majorana masses via the spontaneous breakdown of the lepton number , which in turn means that a majoron , which is inconsistent with the accelerator experiments as lep , appears .",

    "we introduce the @xmath0 triplet higgs model where the smallness of the neutrino masses is naturally explained by the shining mechanism in the large extra dimension . in order to violate the lepton number explicitly , which is the source of the majorana mass terms , we need to introduce the two kind of the interactions in addition to the ones in the standard model .",
    "it is a first fruitful consequence that we can obtain the condition ( [ tencon ] ) that the primordial baryon number is not washed out by solving the boltzmann equations in the model .",
    "we find that in order to protect the primordial baryon number , either of the two kind of the interactions , both of which are needed to violate the lepton number explicitly , must be out of equilibrium under the in - equilibrium sphaleron - anomaly processes .",
    "the condition to protect the primordial baryon number is easily extended into the case that the differences of the three lepton flavors are taken into account .",
    "it is a second fruitful consequence that we can obtain the allowed region where the condition to protect the primordial baryon number , the results of the neutrino oscillation experiments and wmap , and the constraints on the @xmath1 parameter are all satisfied in the model .",
    "a typical allowed region is shown in fig .",
    "[ asfig ] .",
    "we find that if both of the coupling constant @xmath29 and @xmath15 are large , the existing baryon number is washed out and when both of @xmath29 and @xmath15 are small , the mass differences which are induced from the neutrino mass matrix are too small to explain the observed neutrino oscillations . in this model ,",
    "the constraints on the @xmath1 parameter give the upper bounds on the coupling constant @xmath29 for the fixed triplet higgs masses .",

    "we first make comment on the pre - existing approximately conserved charge .",
    "we actually obtain the approximately conserved charges , @xmath466 or @xmath467 .",
    "the primordial baryon number is protected in proportion to the initial value of the conserved charge .",
    "can we naturally expect that the initial amount of the conserved charge exists in the early universe ?",
    "we recall that in the @xmath102 gut , the initial value of the conserved charge @xmath468 is naturally assumed to be zero , which regrettably leads to the washing out of the baryon number by the in - equilibrium sphaleron processes .",
    "the difference between the case we examine and the case of @xmath102 gut is that in the former case the conserved charge is approximate one , while in the latter case the conserved charge is exact one .",
    "so there is no reason why an approximately conserved charge is not generated by the unknown mechanism at the very early universe .",
    "we finally enumerate the remaining problems and the analyses which have not been carried out yet in this paper .",
    "the first problem is that we have omitted all four body processes such as @xmath469 or @xmath470 , where @xmath471 is the lepton and @xmath472 is the higgs field .",
    "although we expect that the rates of the four body processes are much smaller than those of the three body processes , the four body processes should be taken into account for the exactness .",
    "the second problem is that the analyses containing cp violation are not carried out .",
    "we have dealt in the restricted parameter region where there are no cp violation in the lepton sector of the models in order to focus on the feature that the baryon number is washed out in the majorana neutrino mass models .",
    "if we try to investigate the feature more generally and more exactly , the analyses containing the cp violation should be carried out . however , even if the @xmath0 triplet higgs model which has the only one triplet higgs field contains cp violation in the lepton sector , the baryon number can not be generated .",
    "hence the condition to protect the primordial baryon number which we obtain in this paper is valid in the case that the model contains the cp violation . on the other hand ,",
    "since majorana neutrino mass matrix generally has one kobayashi - maskawa phase and two majorana phases , the analyses of the results of the neutrino oscillation experiments might be slightly changed .",
