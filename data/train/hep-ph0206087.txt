    "the fermionic sector of the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particle physics is described by 13 renormalized parameters ( 6 quark masses , 3 charged lepton masses , 3 ckm mixing angles , and one cp violation phase ) .",
    "obviously , these parameters are not arbitrary , but exhibit relations which can only be understood when going beyond the sm .",
    "one possibility to obtain realistic quark masses and ckm mixing angles in an extension of the sm is to introduce flavor symmetries that are sequentially broken . at the first glance ,",
    "the hierarchical mass spectra of the quarks and the charged leptons actually suggest underlying non - abelian flavor symmetry groups acting on the first and second generations only",
    ". however , in the light of recent atmospheric @xcite and solar @xcite neutrino experimental results , it seems to be difficult to extend this idea to the neutrinos .",
    "especially , the result that , among the different possible solutions of the solar neutrino problem , the mikheyev  smirnov  wolfenstein ( msw ) @xcite large mixing angle ( lma ) solution is the presently preferred one @xcite , draws a picture of the involved flavor symmetries and their breaking mechanisms that differs remarkably from the early approaches , which have been applied to the quark sector . in the `` standard '' parameterization",
    ", the msw lma solution implies that we have a _",
    "bilarge _ mixing scenario in the lepton sector in which the solar mixing angle @xmath0 is large , but not necessarily close to maximal , the atmospheric mixing angle @xmath1 is nearly maximal , and the reactor mixing angle @xmath2 is small .",
    "clearly , this is in sharp contrast to the quark sector in which all mixing angles are small @xcite and it indicates that the flavor symmetries act on the third generation too .    by assuming only an abelian u(1 ) flavor symmetry , one obtains that the atmospheric mixing angle may be large , but",
    "can not be enforced to be nearly maximal @xcite .",
    "therefore , a natural close to maximal @xmath4-@xmath5-mixing can be interpreted as a strong hint for some underlying non - abelian flavor symmetry acting on the second and third generations @xcite .",
    "neutrino mass models which give large or maximal solar and atmospheric mixing angles by putting the second and third generations of the leptons into the regular representation of the symmetric group @xmath6 @xcite or into the irreducible two - dimensional representation of the symmetric group @xmath7 @xcite are , in general , plagued with a fine - tuning problem in the charged lepton sector , since they tend to predict the muon and tau masses to be of the same order of magnitude , _",
    "i.e. _ , they lack providing an understanding of the hierarchical mass spectrum in the charged lepton sector . a recently proposed model based on an su(3 ) flavor symmetry @xcite gives approximately bimaximal leptonic mixing as well as a successful description of the charged fermion masses , but predicts the presently disfavored msw low mass ( low ) or vacuum oscillation ( vac ) solution of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "similarly , the highly predictive models of flavor democracy @xcite yield large solar and atmospheric mixing angles , but fit the low or vac solution rather than the msw lma solution @xcite . in grand unified theory model building",
    ", it seems that the msw lma solution with a normal hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum is more natural than with an inverted one @xcite ( for a recent phenomenological analysis of minimal schemes for the msw lma solution with inverted hierarchical neutrino mass spectra , see , _ e.g. _ , ref.@xcite ) . also from empirical lepton and quark mass spectra analyses a normal hierarchical ( or inverse hierarchical ) neutrino mass spectrum seems to be rather plausible @xcite",
    ". a comparably simple way of generating the msw lma solution with normal hierarchical neutrino mass spectra is , _",
    "e.g. _ , provided by models based on single right - handed neutrino dominance @xcite .    in a previous letter @xcite",
    ", we introduced a model for bilarge leptonic mixing based on higher - dimensional operators , using the froggatt ",
    "nielsen mechanism , and abelian horizontal flavor symmetries of continuous and discrete types . in this paper",
    ", we consider a modified and extended version of this model and we explicitly demonstrate the _ vacuum alignment mechanism _ , which produces a nearly maximal atmospheric mixing angle @xmath1 as well as a large , but not close to maximal , solar mixing angle @xmath0 , as required by the msw lma solution .",
    "simultaneously , the vacuum alignment mechanism generates a strictly hierarchical charged lepton mass spectrum thus resolving the fine - tuning problem many realistic models , which seek to predict the msw lma solution , are suffering from . furthermore , this model gives a small mixing of the first and second generations of the charged leptons , which is comparable with the mixing of the quarks , whereas the mixing among the neutrinos is essentially bimaximal @xcite .",
    "the actual leptonic mixing angles are then a result of combining the contributions coming from both the charged leptons and the neutrinos ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) .",
    "thus , the model predicts the relation @xmath8 between the solar mixing angle @xmath0 and the reactor mixing angle @xmath2 , which is non - zero and lies in the range of the quark mixing angles .",
    "note that our study assumes that there are three neutrino flavors , and therefore , three neutrino flavor states @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and also three neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "furthermore , it assumes that all @xmath13 violation phases are equal to zero .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : rep_con ] , we introduce the representation content of our model including u(1 ) charges and discrete symmetries .",
    "the multi - scalar potential of the model is then analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec : scalar_pot ] , where we explicitly demonstrate the vacuum alignment mechanism .",
    "next , in secs .  [",
    "sec : yukawa_cl ] and [ sec : yukawa_n ] , the yukawa interactions of the charged leptons and neutrinos , respectively , are investigated and discussed , which lead to the mass matrices of the corresponding particles . in sec .",

    "are briefly studied in sec .",

    "[ sec : s&c ] , we present a summary as well as our conclusions . in addition",
    ", we present in the appendix a scheme for how to transform any given @xmath15 unitary matrix to the `` standard '' parameterization form of the particle data group @xcite .",
    "let us consider an extension of the sm in which the lepton masses are generated by higher - dimensional operators @xcite via the froggatt ",
    "nielsen mechanism @xcite .",
    "( a classification of effective neutrino mass operators has been given in ref.@xcite . ) since we are mainly concerned with the question of whether there is a possible naturally maximal @xmath4-@xmath5-mixing in the msw lma solution or not , for which the properties of the quarks are seemingly irrelevant , we will , for simplicity and without loss of generality , omit the quark sector in our further discussion .",
    "for a recent related study including also the quark sector , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs.@xcite . in a self - explanatory notation , we will denote the lepton doublets as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , and the right - handed charged leptons as @xmath18 , where @xmath17 .",
    "the part of the scalar sector , which carries non - zero sm quantum numbers , consists of two higgs doublets @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath19 couples to the neutrinos and @xmath20 to the charged leptons .",
    "this can be achieved by assuming , _",
    "e.g. _ , a discrete @xmath21 symmetry under which @xmath20 and @xmath22 ( @xmath10 ) are odd and @xmath19 and the rest of the sm fields are even .",
    "the masses of the charged leptons arise through the mixing with additional heavy right - handed charged fermions , which all have masses of the order of magnitude of some characteristic mass scale @xmath23 . apart from some general prescriptions of their transformations under the flavor symmetries , which will be introduced below",
    ", it is not necessary to explicitly present the fundamental theory of these additional ( or extra ) charged fermions .",
    "this is in contrast to the neutrino sector , which we will extend by five additional heavy sm singlet dirac neutrinos @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the neutrinos @xmath27 and @xmath28 are supposed to have masses of the same order @xmath23 as the charged intermediate froggatt ",
    "nielsen states , whereas @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 all have masses of the order of magnitude of some relevant high ( unification ) mass scale @xmath29 .",
    "while @xmath29 takes the role of some seesaw scale @xcite ( and it is therefore responsible for the smallness of the neutrino masses ) , @xmath23 can be as low as several tev @xcite . in order to obtain the structures of the lepton mass matrices from an underlying symmetry principle in the context of a renormalizable field theory",
    ", we will furthermore extend the scalar sector by additional sm singlet scalar fields @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 and we will assign these fields gauged horizontal u(1 ) charges @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 as follows : @xmath36 in the rest of the paper , it will always be understood that the higgs doublets @xmath19 and @xmath20 are total singlet under transformations of other additional symmetries .",
    "note that the charges @xmath33 and @xmath34 are anomalous .",
    "however , it is known that anomalous u(1 ) charges may arise in effective field theories from strings .",
    "then , the cancellation of the anomalies must be accomplished by the green  schwarz mechanism @xcite .    the first generation of the charged leptons is distinguished from the second and third generations if we require for @xmath37 , where the integer @xmath38 obeys @xmath39 , invariance of the lagrangian under transformation of the following @xmath40 symmetry : @xmath41 where we assume that the fields @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are singlets under transformation of the symmetry @xmath42 . in addition , the symmetry @xmath42 forbids the fields @xmath43 to participate in the leading order mass terms for the neutrinos .",
    "furthermore , the permutation symmetries @xmath44 are responsible for generating a naturally maximal atmospheric mixing angle , since they establish exact degeneracies of the yukawa couplings in the leptonic 2 - 3-subsector",
    ". these permutation symmetries also play a crucial role in the scalar sector in which they restrict some of the couplings in the multi - scalar potential to be exactly degenerate ( at tree level ) , which means that degenerate vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) can emerge after spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) .",
    "this so - called vacuum alignment mechanism can work if we assume the discrete symmetries @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are some integers .",
    "for the symmetry @xmath49 we additionally require that the froggatt ",
    "nielsen states with non - zero hypercharge can only be multiplied by factors @xmath50 , where @xmath38 is an integer multiple of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , or @xmath48 , and that the differences @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 are sufficiently large .",
    "the only fermion with non - vanishing hypercharge that transforms differently is the right - handed electron @xmath54 .",
    "these symmetries restrict the allowed combinations of the scalar fields in the higher - dimensional lepton mass operators as well as in the renormalizable terms of the multi - scalar potential .",
    "thus , possibly dangerous terms in the multi - scalar potential can be forbidden , which could otherwise spoil the vacuum alignment mechanism .    at this stage , it is appropriate to point out some implications concerning the nature of the discrete symmetries .",
    "it has been found that relations between yukawa couplings established by standard discrete symmetries can only remain unbroken by quantum gravity corrections if the discrete symmetries are gauged @xcite .",
    "these `` discrete gauge symmetries '' appear in continuum theories when a gauge symmetry group @xmath55 is broken to a discrete symmetry subgroup @xmath56 . since acceptable continuous gauge theories have to be free from chiral anomalies , one obtains discrete anomaly cancellation conditions , which strongly constrain the massless fermion content of the theory @xcite . at a more fundamental level , this implies for our model that the permutation symmetries must actually be gauged , since the relations , which are based on them , will prove to be crucial for obtaining essentially strict maximal atmospheric mixing .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that in @xmath57-theory , one expects the discrete symmetries to be always anomaly - free @xcite .",
    "from the most general two - higgs doublet potential of the fields @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( for an extensive review on electroweak higgs potentials , see , _ e.g. _ , ref.@xcite ) we conclude that , in presence of the @xmath21 symmetry , which distinguishes between @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : rep_con ] ) , each of these fields appears only to the second or fourth power in the multi - scalar potential .",
    "hence , in any renormalizable terms of the multi - scalar potential , which mix @xmath19 or @xmath20 with the sm singlet scalar fields , the higgs doublets are only allowed to appear in terms of their absolute squares @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "next , since the higgs doublets carry zero @xmath60 and @xmath35 charges and are @xmath61-singlets , where @xmath62 , there exists a range of parameters in the multi - scalar potential for which the standard two - higgs electroweak symmetry breaking is possible .",
    "furthermore , this implies that we can , without loss of generality , separate the sm singlet scalar part from the higgs - doublet part in the multi - scalar potential by formally absorbing the absolute squares of the vevs @xmath63 and @xmath64 into the coupling constants of the mixed terms .",
    "then , since the vacuum alignment mechanism of the sm singlet fields is independent from the details of the higgs doublet physics , we can in what follows discard the effects of the higgs doublets and fully concentrate on the properties of the sm singlet scalar fields .",
    "the symmetry @xmath67 requires that the fields @xmath65 and @xmath66 enter the renormalizable interactions of the scalar fields only in terms of the operators @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . the product @xmath70 has the u(1 ) charge structure @xmath71 , implying that the only renormalizable interaction in the scalar potential , which involves this product , is actually @xmath72 .",
    "we can assume that both of the fields @xmath65 and @xmath66 finally develop non - vanishing vevs with magnitudes @xmath73 and @xmath74 that are not too large . since the fields @xmath65 and @xmath66 are singlets under transformations of all the permutation symmetries @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , they will have no effect on the relative alignment of the rest of the scalar fields , because they enter the corresponding interactions only in terms of the absolute squares @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "for this reason we will , without loss of generality , discard the terms in the scalar potential which involve the fields @xmath65 and @xmath66 in our considerations .    from the assignment of the u(1 ) charges @xmath79 , and @xmath35 and the symmetry @xmath67 ( which does not permute any of the fields ) it follows that any renormalizable term in the scalar potential which involves the sm singlet fields @xmath80 , or @xmath32 can only be allowed if these fields appear in one of the following combinations : @xmath81 where `` @xmath82 '' ( @xmath83 ) denotes some linear combination of the fields @xmath84 and @xmath85 . among the products in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2fold ] ) only the product @xmath86 transforms non - trivially under the symmetry @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , since the fields @xmath87 are @xmath42-singlets , we observe that the fields @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which carry a non - zero @xmath42-charge , can only appear either in the combination @xmath90 or in the combination @xmath91 .",
    "however , the latter combination is forbidden by @xmath92-invariance .      as in sec .  [",
    "sec : phi9and10 ] , we can assume that the field @xmath32 finally develops a non - vanishing vev with a magnitude @xmath93 that is not too large .",
    "except for the combination @xmath86 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2fold ] ) all scalar interactions involve an equal number ( 0 , 1 , or 2 ) of the fields @xmath32 and its adjoint @xmath94 , which can then be paired to the absolute square @xmath95 .",
    "since the interaction @xmath96 is forbidden by the symmetries @xmath42 and @xmath67 and @xmath32 is a total singlet under transformations of the discrete symmetries @xmath97 , all terms which involve the absolute square @xmath95 will have no influence on the relative alignment of the rest of the scalar fields .",
    "for this reason we can , without loss of generality , omit the terms in the scalar potential which involve @xmath95 in our considerations .      from the u(1 )",
    "charge assignment we conclude that only an even number of the fields @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( or their complex conjugates ) can participate in the scalar interactions .",
    "let us now especially consider the operator @xmath100 ( or equivalently its complex conjugate ) . under application of each of the symmetries @xmath101 and @xmath102 the operator @xmath100 changes sign .",
    "therefore , the symmetry @xmath101 requires this operator to couple to one of the fields taken from the set @xmath103 .",
    "simultaneously , the symmetry @xmath102 requires this operator to couple only to fields taken from the extended set @xmath104 .",
    "both conditions can only be fulfilled if the operator @xmath100 couples to the field @xmath98 or its complex conjugate , but not to the operator products @xmath105 , or @xmath106 .",
    "since the product @xmath100 carries the u(1 ) charges @xmath107 , the operator @xmath100 can only couple to some linear combination of the operators @xmath108 and @xmath109 . as a consequence ,",
