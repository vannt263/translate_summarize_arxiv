    "quantum chromodynamics and asymptotic freedom@xcite predict the existence of a new state of matter@xcite , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , at exceedingly high temperatures and energy densities similar to the ones that characterized the first few microseconds after the big bang .",
    "the quest for such a deconfined state of qcd has led to the highly successful program at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and will be an integral part of the program at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "recent theoretical developments have improved our understanding of the complex many - body dynamics in high energy nuclear collisions .",
    "comparison between data and theory is suggestive of the creation of a deconfined state of qcd with energy density on the order of 100 times normal nuclear matter density . for a review of the rhic experimental results see@xcite .",
    "an economical description of the bulk particle production in @xmath1 reactions can be achieved in the framework of the thermal model .",
    "all measured particle ratios at midrapidity from the @xmath2  gev @xmath3 runs at rhic are well reproduced with @xmath4  mev and @xmath5  mev , respectively@xcite .",
    "such approach , while instructive , does not carry information about the dynamical evolution prior to freeze - out . constraining the initial conditions , relevant at the early stages of relativistic heavy ion collisions ,",
    "requires the development and application of microscopic models",
    ".    _ relativistic hydrodynamics . _",
    "differential particle distributions at low @xmath0 can be calculated in the framework of relativistic hydrodynamics@xcite , which assumes local thermal equilibrium and solves the energy - momentum and current conservation @xmath6 additional constraints , necessary to determine the system eq .",
    "( [ hydro ] ) , include , for example , ideal hydrodynamics and equation of state @xmath7 or a boost invariant bjorken model .",
    "good description of the @xmath8  gev hadron spectra for @xmath9 can be obtained .",
    "however , the elliptic flow @xmath10 of massive hadrons was shown to be much more sensitive to the choice of equation of state ( eos ) with first order phase transition ( preferred ) versus hadronic eos@xcite .",
    "traces of early partonic thermalization , as suggested by hydrodynamics , can also be found in the in the mean @xmath0 fluctuations versus centrality@xcite .",
    "recent hydrodynamic simulations have employed initial conditions motivated by gluon saturation phenomenology@xcite . in @xmath1 reaction",
    "this approach alleviates the problem with the transverse energy and the parton number in such models .",
    "however , it leaves an open question for @xmath11 reactions where the hydrodynamic description is not applicable .    _ parton coalescence .",
    "_ another microscopic approach to low and moderate @xmath0 hadroproduction is the covariant boltzmann transport@xcite .",
    "the theory was shown to be applicable not only in @xmath1 but also in @xmath11 reactions@xcite and has provided a good description of the rapidity density of hadrons @xmath12 and their transverse momentum distributions .",
    "the output of a partonic transport can be incorporated in the coalescence / recombination models that convolute the quark wigner functions with the meson and baryon wavefunctions@xcite .",
    "these predict scaling properties of the elliptic flow @xmath10@xcite @xmath13 at intermediate transverse momenta and enhanced baryon to meson ratios such as @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the energy loss of quarks and gluons plays an important role in the generation of the elliptic flow at the partonic level@xcite .",
    "it also suppresses the perturbative high @xmath0 hadron production and thus extends the region of possible non - perturbative contribution for baryons@xcite .",
    "coalescence models have been used to calculate the expected charm meson transverse momentum distributions and the charm meson and baryon elliptic flow@xcite .",
    "in the nuclear environment , modifications to the qcd factorization approach@xcite arise from the elastic , inelastic and coherent multiple scattering .",
    "these can be systematically incorporated in to the perturbative formalism@xcite . for @xmath16 , @xmath11 and @xmath1",
    "reactions their effect on experimental observables is summarized in table  1 .",
    "the relative importance of these distinct contributions in the different kinematic and density regimes is yet to be determined .",
    "[ table1 ]    elastic scattering leads to a cronin enhancement and a small broadening of the away side correlation function @xmath17 .",
    "these have been discussed in@xcite .",
    "_ coherent power corrections . _ a class of corrections that can be naturally incorporated in the perturbative qcd factorization approach is associated with the power suppressed @xmath18 contributions . the higher twist terms are typically neglected in reactions with `` elementary '' nucleons for @xmath19  gev@xmath20 . however , in the presence of nuclear matter such corrections can be enhanced by the large nuclear size @xmath21 .    the effective longitudinal interaction length probed by the virtual meson of momentum @xmath22",

( [ shift ] )",
    "@xmath33 is the physical mass of the quark in the final state .    in ref .",
    "@xcite next - to - leading order global analysis of the nuclear parton distributions ( npdfs ) was shown to strongly disfavor more than @xmath34 gluon shadowing .",
    "this result also suggests that the observed attenuation in the structure functions is a result of multiple final state scattering since any dynamical mechanism will predict an effect twice as large for gluons when compared to quarks , @xmath35 .",
    "application to nuclear shadowing in the dis structure function @xmath36 is shown in the left panel of fig .  1 .",
    "the coherent nuclear enhanced power corrections in single and double inclusive hadron production in @xmath11 reactions have been evaluated in@xcite .",

    "the most efficient mechanism that modifies the large transverse momentum hadroproduction in the presence of a hot and dense quark - gluon plasma is the medium induced gluon bremsstrahlung@xcite .",
    "it leads to strong suppression of high-@xmath0 particles , known as jet quenching .",
    "non - abelian energy loss was also shown to be an effective attenuation mechanism in cold nuclear matter@xcite .",
