    "let @xmath1 satisfy and have no discontinuities of the second kind .",
    "then the family of distributions in @xmath36 of the solutions to sdes satisfies the ldp with the speed function @xmath37 and the good rate function equal to @xmath38 for @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 otherwise .",
    "theorem [ t1 ] has the form very similar to the classical wentzel ",
    "freidlin theorem ( @xcite , chapter 3 ,  2 ) , which establishes ldp in a much more general setting , for multidimensional markov processes that may contain both diffusive and jump parts .",
    "however , the wentzel ",
    "freidlin approach substantially exploits the  continuity of infinitesimal characteristics of the process .",
    "the natural question arises : to which extent the continuity assumption can be relaxed in this theory . in @xcite , the ldp was established for multidimensional diffusions with unit diffusion matrix and drift coefficients discontinuous along a given hyperplane ; see also @xcite for some other results in this direction . in @xcite , this result , in the one - dimensional setting , is extended to the case of piecewise smooth drift and diffusion coefficients with one common discontinuity point .",
    "the technique in the aforementioned papers is based on the analysis of the joint distribution of the process itself and its occupation time in the half - space above the discontinuity point ( surface ) and is hardly applicable when the structure of the discontinuity sets for the coefficients is more complicated . in @xcite , the ldp for a one - dimensional sde with zero drift coefficient",
    "was established under a very mild regularity condition on @xmath19 : for the latter , it was only assumed that its discontinuity set has zero lebesgue measure .",
    "extension of this result to the case of nonzero drift coefficient is far from being trivial . in @xcite ,",
    "such an extension was provided , but the assumption therein that @xmath42 possesses a  bounded derivative is definitely too restrictive . in this paper , we summarize the studies from @xcite and @xcite ; note that the assumption on @xmath19 in the current paper is slightly stronger than in  @xcite.=1    we note that our main result , theorem [ t1 ] , well illustrates the relation of the ldp with discontinuous coefficients to the classical wentzel ",
    "freidlin theory : the rate function in this theorem is given in a classical form , but with the properly modified coefficients .",
    "the heuristics of this modification is clearly seen .",
    "namely , thanks to ( ii ) , the rate functional @xmath43 is lower semicontinuous ; see section [ s22 ] .",
    "assertion ( i ) corresponds to the fact that , in the case @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the family @xmath18 with @xmath44 weakly converges to the constant function equal to @xmath45 .",
    "we interpret the limiting function as the solution to the ode @xmath46 , and note that a similar ode for @xmath47 may fail to have a solution at all .",
    "recall that a family @xmath17 is called _ exponentially tight _ with the speed function @xmath48 if for each @xmath49 , there exists a compact set @xmath50 such that @xmath51 for an exponentially tight family , the ldp is equivalent to the _ weak _ ldp ; the latter by definition means that the upper bound holds for all _ compact _ sets  @xmath52 , whereas the lower bound still holds for all open sets @xmath53 .",
    "an equivalent formulation of the weak ldp is the following : for each @xmath54 , @xmath55where @xmath56 denotes the open ball with center @xmath45 and radius @xmath57 .",
    "to prove , we will use a certain extension of the _ contraction principle _ , which in its classical form ( e.g. , @xcite , section 3.1 , and @xcite , section 4.2.1 ) states the ldp for a family @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a family of random elements in a polish space @xmath60 that satisfies an ldp with a good rate function @xmath61 , and",
    "@xmath62 is a _ continuous _ mapping .",
    "the rate function for @xmath18 in this case has the form @xmath63 in the sequel , we use two different representations of our particular family @xmath18 as an image of certain family whose ldp is well understood ; however , the functions @xmath52 in these representations fail to be continuous .",

    "in fact , lemma [ l1 ] says that for an arbitrary image of a family @xmath90 , one part of an ldp ( the upper bound ) holds with one rate function , whereas the other part ( the lower bound ) holds with another rate function .",
    "this is our reason to call and the _ upper _ and the _ lower _ _ semicontraction principles_. to prove , it suffices to verify the inequalities @xmath91 we refer to @xcite for a more discussion and an example where the pair of semicontraction principles do not provide an ldp .      in this section , we prove directly that the functional @xmath43 specified in theorem  [ t1 ] is lower semicontinuous , that is , it is indeed a rate functional .",
    "this will explain the particular choice of the modified functions @xmath92 .",
    "in addition , this will simplify the proofs , where we will use the representation for @xmath93 presented further .    define @xmath94 then @xmath95 , if it is finite , can be represented as @xmath96 + { 1\\over2}\\int_0^t { \\bar a^2(f_t)\\over\\bar\\sigma^{2}(f_t)}\\ , dt \\nonumber \\\\ & { } = : i_1(f)+i_2(f)+i_3(f).\\label{repi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the function @xmath97 is continuous ; hence , the functional @xmath98 is just continuous .",
    "the function @xmath99 is lower semicontinuous by the choice of @xmath22 ; thus , the functional @xmath100 is lower semicontinuous .",
