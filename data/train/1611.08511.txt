    "the supersymmetrized ( susy ) standard model ( sm ) , _ e.g. _ , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , has for a long time intrigued particle theorists in that it is free of the scalar field quadratic divergences that plague non - supersymmetric theories @xcite .",

    "we see that the total production cross section for @xmath181  gev at lhc14 are in the @xmath21020  fb range . by moving up to @xmath211  gev , the cross section drops by about an order of magnitude to about @xmath212  fb . at @xmath213  tev",

    "the total cross sections are in the @xmath216  fb range .",

    "[ fig : bft1]_a _ ) , we show the expected top squark branching fractions versus @xmath136 along the top squark model line .",
    "the branching fractions are from isajet  @xcite . in the plot",
    ", the black curve denotes @xmath218 where for our model line @xmath4 is the lighter , mainly higgsino - like , chargino .",
    "this mode occurs at the @xmath219 rate and is rather model independent ( within the context of natural susy with light higgsinos ) .",
    "the @xmath4 further decays via 3-body mode into @xmath220 where @xmath127 is the higgsino - like lsp .",
    "since @xmath221 ( and @xmath222 ) are @xmath22320  gev , most of the decay energy goes into making the @xmath127 rest mass and is undetected .",
    "the @xmath224 energy is rather soft leading to a few soft tracks .",
    "thus , both the @xmath4 and @xmath225 are only quasi - visible .",
    "meanwhile , the @xmath44-jet from @xmath2 decay may be quite hard , typically in the hundreds of gev .",
    "the red and blue curves denote the @xmath226 and @xmath227 respectively .",
    "both these branching fractions come in at the 2025% level thus covering the bulk of the remaining decays . while the @xmath127 is invisible ( it presumably comprises a portion of the dark matter ) ,",
    "again the @xmath225 and @xmath4 are quasi - visible .",
    "meanwhile , the top quarks are produced at large @xmath228 and also their rest mass leads to energetic decay products .",
    "in addition , there is a non - negligible decay rate @xmath229 where @xmath230 is bino - like and yields visible decays .",
    "these decays occur at the few percent level .",
    "furthermore , @xmath170 decays into wino - like @xmath231 and @xmath232 can occur but at the sub - percent level .",
    "the dip in branching fractions at the center of the plot is due to turn on of @xmath233 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bft1]_b _ ) , we show the same branching fractions versus @xmath25 along the model line .",
    "the branching fractions are again seen to be rather model independent except for @xmath234 ( in the excluded range ) where the decays into top - quarks become kinematically forbidden .",
    "the branching fractions in this plot are double - valued since certain top squark mass values can occur for both large positive and large negative values of @xmath136 .",
    "these mainly affect the tiny branching fractions into wino - like electroweakinos .",
    "the most direct implication of naturalness is the existence of light higgsinos of mass @xmath235300  gev , the lighter the better .",
    "given these expectations on @xmath26 , the lhc lower bound @xmath21  gev applies and we expect top squarks to lie in the mass range @xmath1813000  gev at little cost to naturalness . this mass range is consistent with expectations from comparing the predicted @xmath37 to its measured value .",
    "then , the highly scrutinized @xmath236 degeneracy rarely if ever applies and we expect instead a rather large @xmath237 mass difference . in this case , the top squark branching fraction predictions from sec .  [ sec : prod ] are rather robust : they result over a huge range of nuhm2 parameter space and also under the natural general mirage mediation parameter space found in ref .",
    "we would then expect , quite generally , the following collider signatures to obtain :    a. @xmath238 ,    b. @xmath239 ,    c. @xmath240 . these signatures should be accompanied by the usual initial state radiation plus perhaps additional semi - soft tracks from associated light higgsino @xmath4 and @xmath225 decays .",
    "the first signal channel a. includes rather hard @xmath44-jets plus hard @xmath241 and should be plagued by backgrounds including @xmath242 production where @xmath243 .",
    "one might create distributions using the @xmath244 variable applied to the @xmath9 final state to try to extract a kinematic upper edge which could yield an estimate of the top squark mass .    for signal channel b. , we expect a hard @xmath245-jet along with a hard @xmath44-jet and @xmath241 .",
    "this channel would include @xmath9 along with an added @xmath246 where in the case of hadronic @xmath247 decays , the @xmath247 mass may be reconstructed .",
    "the dominant backgrounds would include @xmath248 production , @xmath249 production and @xmath250 production where @xmath251 and @xmath252 , single top production and @xmath253 production .",
    "this `` mixed top - squark decay channel '' has previously been emphasized by graesser and shelton@xcite .",
    "signal channel c. contains a hard @xmath248 pair plus large @xmath241 .",
    "major backgrounds would include @xmath254 production .",
    "the hard @xmath245-jets may benefit from a top - tagger@xcite .",
    "a credible semi - simplified model could be presented in the @xmath25 vs. @xmath255 mass plane where the several dominant decay branching fractions would be allowed to take place .",
    "physically , this is what is expected to happen and one would then include the dominant mixed decay mode where one @xmath170 decays to @xmath256 while the other decays to @xmath3 .    finally , we comment on indirect searches for top squarks at the lhc . since @xmath2573  tev is predicted in the radiatively - driven natural susy , one may expect that its signature can be probed indirectly via the precise measurements of the higgs decay branching ratios , as top squarks affect the @xmath258 and @xmath259 decay channels at one - loop level . as it turns out , however , the deviations of these decay branches from the sm prediction are too small to be detected even at the hl - lhc @xcite .",
    "this observation again leads to the conclusion that future colliders such as ilc or an energy upgraded lhc are required for a thorough coverage of ( just the top - squark sector of ) natural susy .",
    "in this paper we have re - examined the phenomenology of top squarks expected from natural susy . we first noted that older expectations of very light top squarks based on requiring small @xmath260 are technically flawed in that they neglect the contribution of @xmath58 to its own running . by properly including this contribution",
    ", then the @xmath100 measure reduces to @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath125 requires light higgsinos @xmath261300  gev while much heavier top squarks @xmath2623  tev are allowed at little cost to naturalness . in the latter case , the radiative corrections to @xmath58 aid in driving it from large unnatural high scale values to natural values at the weak scale",
    " a situation known as radiatively - driven natural susy or rns . for the case of bg naturalness ,",
    "if @xmath104 is evaluated in multi - soft - parameter effective theories , then one obtains an overestimate of fine - tuning as compared to the calculation for a more fundamental theory wherein the soft terms are all correlated . in the latter case , @xmath104 reduces to @xmath28 .    using @xmath28",
    ", it is found that current lhc top squark search constraints have probed only a fraction of the allowed @xmath25 vs. @xmath32 parameter plane .",
    "the compressed region , which has been heavily searched , admits few or no solutions .",
    "further , values of @xmath38  gev lead to typically large deviations in @xmath37 .",
    "top squark production and decay rates are calculated in natural susy and lead to comparable mixtures of @xmath241 plus @xmath263 , @xmath248 and @xmath264 signatures .",
    "it is emphasized that a semi - simplified model containing the major admissible final states would be most helpful to truly constrain the natural susy parameter space or to discover top squarks .",
    "nonetheless , plenty of perfectly natural susy solutions exist with @xmath25 values well beyond the reach of hl - lhc",
    ". to probe the entire expected natural susy top squark parameter space will likely require an energy upgrade of lhc to the @xmath2733  tev regime . to this end , in fig .",
    "[ fig : bar ] , we show the current exclusion limit on top squark masses from atlas / cms for a light @xmath265200  gev .",
    "we also show the hl - lhc projected reach and exclusion limits for 3000 fb@xmath186 of integrated luminosity @xcite along with the projected reach of future @xmath208 colliders with @xmath266 and 100 tev@xcite .",
    "in contrast to common notions , the display shows that hl - lhc has a very limited reach for natural susy in the top - squark pair production channel .",
    "even if no top - squark signal is seen at hl - lhc , then there will be little impact on excluding natural susy ( other channels such as same - sign diboson or soft dilepton plus jets appear more lucrative to hl - lhc)@xcite .",
    "however , an energy upgrade to he - lhc with @xmath266 tev will have a @xmath185 discovery reach to @xmath267 tev and a 95% cl exclusion reach to 4 tev .",
    "such a reach will either discover or exclude natural susy in the top squark sector .",
    "we also show the snowmass projected reach@xcite for top - squark pairs for a 100 tev collider .",
    "such a machine is projected to probe up to @xmath268 tev .",
    "this reach probes beyond a 33 tev machine only further into unnatural regions of parameter space .",

    "<S> in supersymmetric models with radiatively - driven naturalness and light higgsinos , the top squarks may lie in the 0.53  tev range and thus only a fraction of natural parameter space is accessible to lhc searches . </S>",

    "<S> we note that the branching fraction for @xmath0 decay favors top squarks much heavier than 500  gev . </S>",
    "<S> such a range of top - squark mass values is in contrast to previous expectations where @xmath1  gev had been considered natural . in radiative natural susy , </S>",
