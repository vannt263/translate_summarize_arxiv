    "a total of 14 initial he - core pre - wd models with stellar masses between @xmath73 and @xmath74 were computed for initial orbital periods at the beginning of the roche lobe phase in the range @xmath75 to @xmath76 d.      a complete description of the results presented in this section can be found in crsico et al .",

    "our results are in good agreement with the predictions of the stability analysis carried out by jeffery & saio ( 2013 ) . at @xmath88",
    "k there is also a non - negligible contribution to mode driving due to the he - he@xmath89 and h - h@xmath89 partial ionization zones ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively ) .",
    "the blue edge for @xmath92 modes ( not shown ) is slightly ( @xmath93 k ) hotter than the @xmath83 blue edge .",
    "the location of the blue edges does not depend on the prescription for the mlt theory of convection adopted in the equilibrium models .",
    "this is at variance with what happens in the case of elmvs ( see the next section ) .",
    "the blue edge of radial modes is substantially cooler ( @xmath94 k ) than for nonradial modes .",
    "our computations seem to account for the existence of some of the known pre - elmvs , including the observed ranges of excited periods . however , our analysis is not able to predict pulsations in three pulsating objects ( the hottest ones , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this is directly related to the he abundance ( @xmath95 ) at the driving region .",
    "higher he abundances at the envelope of our models would be required in order to the blue edge be hotter , as to include these three stars within the instability domain .",
    "this could be achieved by adopting different masses for the initial donor star in the original binary system , that could led to low - mass pre - wd models with different he abundances at their envelopes .",
    "this issue will be explored in a future study .",
    "when we take into account the action of element diffusion ( due to gravitational settling and chemical and thermal diffusion ) , @xmath95 decreases rapidly at the driving region by virtue of gravitational settling , and thus the instability region ( not shown ) in the @xmath82 plane becomes much narrower than in the case of non diffusion , so that none of the observed pulsating pre - elmv stars is within that region .",
    "this important result suggests that _ element diffusion could not be operative in the pre - wd stage_. several factors could be playing a role to prevent the effects of element diffusion , namely stellar winds and/or stellar rotation .",
    "this interesting topic has been recently addressed by istrate & fontaine ( these proceedings ) , who found that rotational mixing is indeed able to suppress the effects of element diffusion .",
    "we have analyzed the stability properties of about 7000 stellar models of he - core , low - mass wds with h - pure atmospheres taking into account three different prescriptions for the mlt theory of convection ( ml1 , ml2 , ml3 ; see tassoul et al .",
    "1990 for their definitions ) and covering a range of effective temperatures of @xmath96 k and a range of stellar masses of @xmath97 . for each model , we assessed the pulsation stability of radial ( @xmath98 ) and nonradial ( @xmath99 ) @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes with periods from a range @xmath100 s for the sequence with @xmath101 , up to a range of periods of @xmath102 s for the sequence of with @xmath103 .",
    "full details of these calculations are given in crsico & althaus ( 2016 ) .",

    "[ fig2 ] the spectroscopic hr diagram for our low - mass he - core wd evolutionary tracks ( final cooling branches ) , along with the location of the seven known elmvs ( red circles ) , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 have been computed with 1d model atmospheres after 3d corrections .",
    "the instability domain of @xmath83 @xmath0 modes due to the @xmath84 mechanism acting at the h - h@xmath89 partial ionization region is emphasized with a gray region bounded by a dashed blue line corresponding to the blue edge of the instability domain .",
    "our results are in good agreement with those of crsico et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and van grootel et al .",
    "some short - period @xmath0 modes are destabilized mainly by the @xmath104 mechanism due to stable nuclear burning at the basis of the h envelope , particularly for model sequences with @xmath105 ( see crsico & althaus 2014a for details ) .",
    "the blue edge of the instability domain in the @xmath106 plane is hotter for higher stellar mass and larger convective efficiency .",
    "the ml2 and ml3 versions of the mlt theory of convection are the only ones that correctly account for the location of the seven known elmv stars .",
    "there is no dependence of the blue edge of @xmath1 modes on the harmonic degree . in the case of @xmath0 modes",
    ", we found a weak sensitivity of the blue edge with @xmath107 .",
    "finally , the blue edges corresponding to radial and nonradial @xmath1 modes are somewhat ( @xmath108 k ) hotter than the blue edges of @xmath0 modes .",
    "we compared the ranges of unstable mode periods predicted by our stability analysis with the ranges of periods observed in the elmv stars .",
    "we generally found an excellent agreement .",

    "the next step is to start exploiting the period spectra of these stars with asteroseismological analysis .",
