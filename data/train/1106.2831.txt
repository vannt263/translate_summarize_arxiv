    "the study of black hole thermodynamics has been an intensely active subject for the past few decades . the fact that such objects emit hawking radiation",
    "has been at the heart of recent developments concerning the paradox of information loss . whilst hawking s calculations indicated that emitted radiation was thermal @xcite , recent arguments have suggested that there are in fact correlations between emitted quanta which can carry away information and therefore preserve unitarity .",
    "the tunneling method of parikh and wilczek @xcite , in particular , has been an important milestone on this particular journey .",
    "there are several puzzling issues which remain , even if the information paradox is resolved , which pertain to the nature of the entropy on the horizon - and its corresponding microstates .",
    "such questions would hopefully be answered by a quantum theory of gravity , however even within string theory such questions are often difficult to pose unless we include supersymmetry .",
    "one particular class of stringy models that may be exactly solvable are those of dilaton gravity in @xmath4 dimensions in the type 0 string @xcite .",
    "such a string only contains bosonic degrees of freedom due to the non - chiral projection acting on the two - dimensional superstring .",
    "it has long been known that charged ( asymptotically flat ) black hole solutions exist in this theory , and its relative simplicity means that it is a good toy model for many of our current conjectures regarding black hole information loss . because the theory arises from a truncation of the full superstring , and one can also use it to test matrix models @xcite .    in this note we will be interested in the thermodynamic geometry of such a black hole configuration , in particular we wish to understand whether a phase transition should be expected at a critical value of the entropy as proposed in @xcite .",
    "we begin by briefly recapitulating the black hole solution before moving on to a discussion of information metrics and different bases in which they are defined .",
    "it has long been known that the low energy effective action for the type @xmath5 theory , with a single non - zero rr flux term and no tachyon , can be written as follows @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a cosmological constant term depending on the string length , and @xmath8 is a constant coming from the gauge field via @xmath9 . denoting the coordinates by @xmath10 we find there is a black hole solution corresponding to the following ; @xmath11 where the function @xmath12 has the following form @xmath13 with @xmath14 corresponding to the mass of the black hole .",
    "the event horizon exists as the solution to @xmath15 and the temperature is given by the usual expression @xmath16 using the wkb approximation , one can argue that hawking radiation arises from quantum tunneling of particles through the event horizon .",
    "a simple calculation then yields the following result for the temperature @xmath17 and therefore one can use the standard thermodynamic relation @xmath18 combined with ( [ eq : master ] ) to determine the entropy , which becomes @xmath19 given the entropy of the system , one can then express the mass ( in the fixed charge ensemble ) as a function of the entropy and the charge @xmath20 allowing us to derive the following thermodynamic variables @xmath21 the expression for the specific heat is interesting because it implies that ( in physically acceptable regions ) the specific heat is _ positive _ which is in stark contrast to most black hole solutions .",
    "this suggests that the black hole is thermodynamically stable , and suggests that the canonical ensemble is valid .",
    "the temperature of the solution is also bounded from above by @xmath22 which corresponds to the hagedorn temperature @xmath23 .",
    "it is believed that one can analytically continue to temperatures greater than @xmath23 using t - duality , in which case one simply studies the black hole solution in type @xmath24 at @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the expectation is that there will then be a phase transition occurring at the hagedorn temperature , which separates these two distinct phases .",
    "however it is not clear whether one can study fluctuations through this point .",
    "note that the non - zero charge allows for the existence of an extremal black hole solution , which can be found by demanding both @xmath26 , which has a mass @xmath27 and zero - temperature ( as expected for an extremal solution ) .",
    "positivity of the extremal mass therefore imposes an upper bound on the flux such that @xmath28",
    ".      in davies paradigm  @xcite , one can see that the specific heat ( [ eq : thermo_variables ] ) does not diverge , therefore a phase transition is not expected .",
    "however if one makes a legendre transformation to work in the fixed potential ensemble , then the specific heat can be written in the form @xmath29 which diverges at @xmath30 , therefore one may expect a phase transition at this value of the entropy .",
    "such phase transitions are commonly studied in the condensed matter community , but less so in the black hole community .",
    "since this value is independent of any other variables , one may expect something unusual occur at @xmath31 in the fixed charge ensemble but this is actually not the case .",
    "all the thermodynamic variables are continuous through the curve @xmath31 .     , of the 0a black hole .",
    "the singular limit of the theory is the entropy cutoff , @xmath32 , which corresponds to the divergence of @xmath33 . ]",
    "one may also be concerned that we are not in einstein frame , therefore the concept of a gravitational phase transition may be ill defined . however because our black hole solution is asymptotically flat , we can use the results of @xcite to show that this is not the case .    in the following section we will study the black hole thermodynamics using information geometry , which involves the construction of a metric using the thermodynamic variables .",
    "one can then construct invariants from the metric , which should be insensitive to the thermodynamic ensemble under consideration .",
    "information geometry  @xcite is the study of probability and information by way of differential geometry . in this note",
    "we focus in particular on the fisher type  @xcite of information geometry in that the hessian matrix of the second derivatives of the energy , or alternatively the entropy , can be regarded as a riemannian metric on the space of thermodynamical states .",
    "when energy is used as a potential this metric is called the weinhold metric  @xcite , when the entropy is used it is called the ruppeiner metric  @xcite .    historically ruppeiner proposed in 1979 a geometrical way of studying thermodynamics of equilibrium systems . in his theory certain aspects of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics of the system under consideration are encoded in a single geometrical object , namely the metric describing its thermodynamic state space . the distance on this space is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the so - called ruppeiner metric defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the system s internal energy ( mass in our study ) , @xmath38 is an entropy function of the thermodynamic system one wishes to consider and @xmath39 stand for other extensive variables , or mechanically conserved charges of the system in our application .",
    "the minus sign in the definition is due to concavity of the entropy function .",
    "it was observed by ruppeiner that in thermodynamic fluctuation theory the riemannian curvature of the ruppeiner metric measures the complexity of the underlying statistical mechanical model , i.e. it is flat for the ideal gas whereas any curvature singularities are a signal of critical behavior .",
    "the ruppeiner theory has been applied to numerous systems and yielded significant results , for details see  @xcite .",
    "ruppeiner originally developed his theory in the context of thermodynamic fluctuation theory , for systems in canonical ensembles .",
    "the ruppeiner metric is conformally related to the weinhold metric through @xmath40 where @xmath41 is thermodynamic temperature of the system .",
    "it is worth noting that some flat ruppeiner geometries can be accounted for by the flatness theorem  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , whenever the entropy function takes the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 otherwise the ruppeiner metric is degenerate .",
    "this theorem is , however , not applicable to our study because of the form of the entropy .",
    "the ruppeiner method is not only usable for determining the underlying statistical mechanic model of the system , but also detecting its critical behavior .",
    "incidentally it is consistent with the so - called _ poincar _ s linear series method for analyzing stability in non - extensive systems .",
    "this method is simple owing to the fact that it utilizes only a few thermodynamic functions such as the fundamental relations in order to study / analyze ( in)stabilities .",
    "this method can thus be applied to bhs although they are non - extensive systems .",
    "there have been some compelling results  @xcite but we will not dwell on this as it is outside the scope of our present work",
    ".    applications of this type of information geometry to black holes can be found in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this method has also been applied to exotic systems such as the hot qcd model  @xcite .",
    "an alternate approach known as geometrothermodynamics ( gtd ) @xcite has been devoted to constructing legendre invariant information metrics , which also appears to yield useful information about the black hole state space .",
    "this approach ensures that the form of the thermodynamic potential does not dictate the phase space structure of the black hole . in this paper",
    "we will apply it to the study of the 0a black hole thermodynamics .",
    "majority of black holes have negative specific heats ( which are characteristics of self - gravitating systems ) and are described microcanonically . in spite of this",
    "we have found that the ruppeiner geometry of black holes is often surprisingly simple and elegant .",
    "furthermore some findings are physically suggestive in particular for ultra - spinning myers - perry black holes , in which the onset of ultra - spinning instability is detected by the singularity of the ruppeiner curvature  @xcite .",
    "it is natural to work in the fixed charge ensemble , since this implies that the black hole solution is in thermal _ and _ electrical equilibrium with the surrounding heat bath .",
    "@xmath44 which ensures that we obtain the correct temperature for the black hole system .",
    "the weinhold analysis can then be determined by identifying the mass of the black hole with the internal energy .",
    "the weinhold analysis then follows by determining the fluctuations of the mass due to changes in the entropy - charge phase space , allowing one to construct a thermodynamic metric from the corresponding hessian .",
    "note that when @xmath45 , the term proportional to @xmath46 in the definition of the mass will vanish ( [ eq : thermo_variables ] ) and therefore our two - parameter system reduces to a one - parameter system .",
    "physically one sees that @xmath47 vanishes at @xmath45 , therefore there is no source for the electric charge . for physical solutions",
    "we must then ensure @xmath48 .",
    "the line element for the weinhold metric can be written in the form @xmath49 which is conformally flat ( as expected for a two - dimensional metric ) . to see this in detail",
    "first define the new variable @xmath50 to eliminate the cross - terms in the metric , allowing us to work in the @xmath51 basis . then define a new variable @xmath52 which immediately implies @xmath53 note that the entire line element vanishes when @xmath54 which corresponds to @xmath55",
    "this will give rise to a singularity in the curvature invariant , however this does not imply a phase transition .",
    "this singular point marks the break - down of the classical theory of thermodynamic fluctuations , in much the same way as we expect the scale factor singularity in frw cosmology to correspond to a break - down of the classical description of space - time .",
    "we propose that @xmath56 is actually the minimum ( classical ) entropy one can associate to this black hole system , and therefore physical entropy satisfies @xmath57 . furthermore note that the weinhold metric has lorentzian signature with @xmath58 symmetry .",
    "the metrics in eq .",
    "( [ eq : weinhold ] , [ eq : weinhold_flat ] ) allow us to construct the weinhold curvature invariants @xmath59 which are both singular at the solution @xmath56 indicating that this is indeed a singular point of the thermodynamic metric .",
    "we can transform the metric in eq .",
    "( [ eq : weinhold_flat ] ) into a manifestly flat form ( in this case minkowskian metric ) in order to study the state space of this bh and compare it to that of other bhs studied elsewhere . we first write it in rindler form ( @xmath60 ) where we obtain @xmath61 and then we transform this to minkowski form using the hyperbolic transformations @xmath62 the opening of the wedge embedded in this minkowskian null cone is given by @xmath63 with the definition of @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : taudef ] ) we write this as a function of the entropy @xmath65 because the entropy has a cutoff limit at @xmath66 we see that @xmath67 diverges which implies that @xmath68 .",
    "this becomes the singular limit for the 0a bh instead of @xmath69 for black holes we have studied previously .",
    "indeed one can see that the @xmath70 function is imaginary for @xmath71 , and only becomes real ( and smoothly increasing ) for physical entropy satisfying @xmath57 .    .",
    "]    to study the physical fluctuations , however , one must work in the ruppeiner geometry since the ruppeiner scalar curvature is a measure of the correlation length of the system .",
    "the metric can be calculated to give @xmath72 which again has an apparent singularity as @xmath54 where the thermodynamic description breaks down .",
    "the corresponding ruppeiner curvature invariant becomes @xmath73 which blows up at @xmath31 and also @xmath74 , which is the extremal limit of the black hole .",
    "there are many other approaches to information geometry which one could consider .",
    "let us therefore examine the gtd approach @xcite where the metric is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 which is legendre invariant .",
    "the corresponding weinhold invariant for this metric becomes @xmath77 - 2q^2\\ln(s)+8s^2\\ln(s/4\\pi ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & q^2(q^2 - 10s)\\ln(s/4\\pi)^2 - 4q^2s\\ln(s/4\\pi)^3\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which appears to diverge along the curve spanned by @xmath78 , which we denote by the solution @xmath79 .",
    "we argue that this is not a physical value for the entropy because @xmath80 and there would be no black hole .",
    "however this is only an apparent singularity in the curvature invariant , and one can show that @xmath81 is in fact finite along this curve .",
    "the only _ real _ divergence of the above invariant is again at @xmath31 .",
    "we compute the ruppeiner invariant in the usual manner @xmath82 where we have defined @xmath83 which , like before , has divergences only at @xmath84 .    there are , however , a large class of legendre invariant metrics available ( in this basis ) and we should consider that they may lead to different results .",
    "two common metrics can be parametrized as follows @xmath85 where the first metric corresponds to @xmath86 and the second one to @xmath87 .",
    "the ruppeiner curvature invariant can be computed in both cases with the result @xmath88 ^ 3 } \\left((q^2 - 4s)^2 -16 s^2",
    "\\ln(s/4\\pi ) \\right ) \\\\ & + & \\frac{64\\pi^2}{k^2\\ln(s/4\\pi)[q^2 - 4s+2q^2 \\ln(s/4\\pi)]^3 } \\left(q^2 + 6s+4\\ln(s/4\\pi)(q^2 + 2s+2s\\ln(s/4\\pi ) ) \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ r^{\\epsilon=0}_r & = & \\frac{32 \\pi^2}{k^2 q^2 } \\frac{(q^2 - 4s)^2 + 16s^2 \\ln(4\\pi)+4s(-4s\\ln(s)+q^2\\ln(s/4\\pi)[s+2\\ln(s/4\\pi)])}{(q^2 - 4s)^3 \\ln(s/4\\pi)^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which only has singularities at @xmath89 .",
    "this is interesting because the singularity at @xmath56 has been removed in this picture      the weinhold method is useful because the hessian is easily calculated , but does it contain all the information about the theory ?",
    "let us consider this question by working directly with the ruppeiner analysis , where the information metric can be considered as the pull - back of the entropy function to a manifold spanned by _",
    "physical _ observables @xmath90 .",
    "indeed this is the form of the metric as first proposed by ruppeiner from thermodynamic fluctuation theory .",
    "the entropy clearly takes the form @xmath91 where @xmath92 $ ] is the lambert - w function , which we will often employ as short - hand notation in what follows .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the extremal solution occurs when @xmath93 , corresponding to the condition @xmath94 which is identical to @xmath95 .",
    "the ruppeiner metric in this case is determined via the hessian @xmath96 and the scalar curvatures are shown to be of the form @xmath97{(16\\pi m-5kq^2)(8\\pi m -kq^2)+2kq^2w[z](16\\pi m-4kq^2+kq^2w[z])}}{w[z](1+w[z])(8\\pi mq-2kq^3+kq^3w[z])^2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{2kq^2[8\\pi m -3kq^2]}{w[z](1+w[z])(8\\pi mq-2kq^3+kq^3w[z])^2 } \\nonumber \\\\ r_w & = & -\\frac{4k \\pi q^2}{(8\\pi m-2k q^2 + kq^2 w[z])^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the ruppeiner invariant has a single divergence at @xmath98 as expected .",
    "the weinhold invariant appears to diverge at @xmath99 but the ruppeiner invariant remains finite at this value .",
    "one can actually identify @xmath100 with @xmath56 in the weinhold picture , which we believe to be a cut - off for the entropy , therefore the ruppeiner invariant is insensitive to this value .",
    "this suggests that the black hole must have mass greater than @xmath101 for the classical theory to be valid .",
    "let us now consider what happens to the gtd theory in the ruppeiner analysis . in this case",
    "the metric takes the form @xmath102 which results in the ruppeiner curvature invariant @xmath103 + \\frac{kq^2}{\\pi}w[z]^2 + \\frac{8 km q^2(kq^2 - 12 m \\pi)}{(8m\\pi -2kq^2+kq^2 w[z])^2 } \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{4 m^3 \\pi } \\frac{(16 m^2 \\pi^2 - 6mk\\pi q^2+k^2q^4)}{(8\\pi m -2kq^2+kq^2 w[z])}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we again employ the short handed notation for the lambert function .",
    "this invariant does not have a non - trivial divergence , which is somewhat troubling because we expect the solution to diverge at extremality .",
    "let us summarize the results in the following table , where we list all the divergences of the ruppeiner invariant .",
    ".divergences of ruppeiner invariant [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     without a detailed analysis one would simply conclude that in the weinhold analysis there was a possible phase transition at @xmath31 , however we believe that the classical thermodynamic picture breaks down at this value , rather than suggesting the appearance of a phase transition .",
    "the underlying physics behind such a cut - off is not apparently clear because the thermodynamic observables are smoothly varying functions .",
    "however the fact that there is no additional dependence on the charge suggests that @xmath56 is a fundamental scale of the theory , and the notion of equilibrium fluctuations breaks down at this point .    in the ruppeiner analysis",
    "only the physical divergences seem to appear ie there are no signs of divergent behaviour at @xmath56 .",
    "however the gtd approach does not include the extremal case , suggesting that only the ruppeiner invariant in the ruppeiner analysis is capable of computing all the relevant physical information .",
    "the @xmath104 gtd description ( in the weinhold analysis ) also only selects this singular point .",
    "in this note we have considered the case of possible phase transitions in the @xmath105 black hole solution using information geometry .",
    "the potential phase transition in the fixed potential ensemble turns out to be associated with a singularity in the description of the thermodynamic geometry , where the line element vanishes .",
    "we interpret this as a ( hard ) cut - off for the entropy of the black hole , which must satisfy @xmath57 in the physical domain - although we do not have a compelling thermodynamic explanation for its existence .",
    "we believe that this singularity represents the break - down of equilibrium thermodynamics , rather than indicating a phase transition .",
    "the distance between equilibrium fluctuations is squeezed as we approach the @xmath56 curve , until it becomes ill defined precisely at @xmath31 indicating that all fluctuations exist at the same singular point .",
    "moreover we compared and contrasted several approaches to the problem in an attempt to understand which curvature invariants contain the physical information about the thermodynamic ensemble .",
    "our results suggest that one should work predominantly with the ruppeiner analysis , since the invariants in the weinhold analysis tend to pick out all divergences - which may not all correspond to phase transitions .",
    "indeed this is natural from the perspective of equilibrium thermodynamic fluctuation theory .",
    "furthermore the ruppeiner invariant , in the ruppeiner analysis , captures the physically relevant divergences ( including the extremal point ) .",
    "our results are preliminary and more detailed comparison of the two approaches is likely to yield better understanding of the power of contact geometry",
    ". it would also be useful to understand the physical relevance of the sign of the curvature invariant , since this should also tell us something useful about the microstates of the black hole theory .",
