    "the phenomena of neutrino oscillation from several experiments have shown that neutrinos have a very small but non - zero masses , see @xcite for review .",
    "for instance , measures from solar neutrino analysis supplemented by kamland estimate @xmath2 ev@xmath3 @xcite , and experiments of atmospheric neutrino oscillation by super - kamiokande show @xmath4 ev@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , oscillation experiments do not give us precision to the absolute scale of neutrino masses , since the measures of @xmath5 and @xmath6 lead us to two different possible scenarios of mass hierarchies , which are known as normal hierarchy ( nh ) and the inverted hierarchy ( ih ) , characterized respectively by the positive and negative sign of the quantity @xmath6 . however , there is still a third possibility of the neutrino mass hierarchy , the so - called degenerate hierarchy ( dh ) , where the masses of the neutrinos are much larger than the differences between them , so all three active neutrinos share the same mass .",
    "see @xcite for a general discussions about neutrino mass hierarchies , and @xcite for cosmological constraints on neutrino mass hierarchies .",
    "massive neutrinos play an important role on the dynamics of the universe , modifying some important cosmological information like the formation of the large scale structure , big bang nucleosynthesis , and cmb anisotropies ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "planck collaboration @xcite within a @xmath7cdm model has measured the total neutrino mass , @xmath8 ev ( from cmb alone ) , and the effective number of neutrino species , @xmath9 at 2@xmath10 confidence level ( cl ) .",
    "an extended @xmath7cdm model has provided @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "forecast on neutrinos from core space mission are reported in @xcite .",
    "further , the estimations on the mass of neutrinos have also been carried out in a series of others pioneer works @xcite .",
    "additionally , cosmological consequences of the massive neutrinos have been investigated in the context of @xmath12 gravity @xcite , holographic dark energy @xcite , scalar field models @xcite , and coupled dark energy @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate how different neutrino mass hierarchical ( or the ordering of the neutrino masses ) scenarios can correlate with the other cosmological parameters in presence of dynamical dark energy ( de ) models . since there are dozens of different dark energy models @xcite , in this work we consider three general parametric models for de , namely the chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization , the logarithmic model , and the jassal - bagla - padmanabhan ( jbp ) parametric model .",
    "the dynamical models of de have been recently constrained from other observational perspectives @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the dynamical dark energy models and their perturbation equations .",
    "section [ sec - data ] describes the observational data that we employ in our analysis . in section [ results ]",
    "we discuss the results of our analysis for all models .",
    "finally , we close our work in section [ conclusions ] with a short summary of the whole work .",
    "let us consider a spatially flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe which is filled with photons ( @xmath13 ) , neutrinos ( @xmath14 ) , baryons ( @xmath15 ) , dark matter ( @xmath16 ) , and dark energy ( @xmath17 ) fluids .",
    "the friedmann s equations in such a universe can be written as    @xmath18    where @xmath19 s and @xmath20 s ( @xmath21 ) are respectively the energy density and the pressure of the @xmath22 component of the fluid .",
    "moreover , we also consider that the fluid components do not interact with other .",
    "in other words , each component is conserved separately , that means the balance equation reads    @xmath23    now , if the dark energy is of dynamical nature , then its evolution is governed by the following equation    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the present value of @xmath26 .",
    "thus , from eq .",
    "( [ evol - eqn ] ) it is evident that if @xmath27 is specified , one can understand the possible evolution of the de in the flrw universe . in our study",
    "we mainly concentrate on three dynamical de models , namely ( i ) the cpl parametrization @xcite , ( iii ) the logarithmic parametrization @xcite , and the ( ii ) jbp parametrization @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we specify the basic equations that describe the evolution and dynamics of the dark energy components under such parametrizations .",
    "a simple parameterization was introduced in @xcite to investigate the possible dynamical aspects of de    @xmath28    where @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the free parameters of the model and physically @xmath31 , i.e. , it is the present value of the de density and @xmath32 .",
    "the same notation is maintained for the next two models .",
    "now , for this parametrization the de evolution is described by    @xmath33    where @xmath34 , i.e. the current value of de density .",
    "let us recall another parametrization intrdouced by efstathiou @xcite in which the equation of state ( eos ) is characterized by a logarithmic law    @xmath35    and the de for this eos evolves as @xmath36 and commonly this parametrization is known as logarithmic parametrization .",
    "let us introduce another de parametrization    @xmath37    where the de evolves as @xmath38 this parametrization is known as the jbp parametrization .",
    "let us now review in a nutshell the linear perturbation equations .",
    "the most general scalar mode perturbation is defined by the following metric @xcite    @xmath39 dx^i dx^j.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , we follow @xcite , and let us adopt the synchronous gauge , i.e. @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "the energy and momentum conservation equations for the @xmath22 component of the fluid in the synchronous gauge are given by @xmath43 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to conformal time , @xmath44 is the conformal hubble function , the quantities @xmath10 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , are respectively the shear , density perturbation , velocity pertubation .",
    "the de perturbations can be written as @xmath47\\,,\\\\ \\theta'_{de } & = - \\mathcal{h } ( 1- 3c^2_s)\\theta_{de } + \\frac{c^2_s}{1+w_{de}}\\ , k^2\\ , \\delta_{de}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where for simplicity we considered @xmath48 . here ,",
    "@xmath49 , is the physical sound speed in the rest frame . in order to avoid the unphysical sound speed we assume @xmath50 . since the baryons , dark matter ,",
    "photons and massive neutrinos are conserved independently , so the perturbation equations for each component follow the standard evolution described in @xcite .",

    "now , looking at the de properties for this model , we have that @xmath30 is non - null at @xmath53 1.2 @xmath10 cl in dh scheme which is characterized by a variation of @xmath30 defined to be @xmath54 .",

    "it is seen from table [ tab : cpl ] that for three different scenarios of mass hierarchies , the observational data return almost similar fit on it .",
    "another important point is the variation on the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "it is known that there is a tension at 3.3@xmath10 on the measures of @xmath1 performed independently by planck collaboration @xcite and the local measurements by riess et al .",
    "@xcite within the @xmath7cdm framework km / s / mpc @xcite that is about 3@xmath10 deviations from the local constraints given by @xmath56 km / s / mpc @xcite . ] .",
    "however , one can note that the constraints on @xmath1 from nh and ih schemes can accommodate the local measurements at 68% cl @xcite .",
    "thus , the cpl model within nh and ih can also serve as a candidate to assuage that current tension in this context .",
    "however , within dh scheme , the model can relieve the tension into the direction as measured by the latest planck mission @xcite .",
    "the constraint on @xmath1 differs from each other , considering nh , or ih and dh up to 2@xmath10 cl .",
    "thus , the determination of a mass hierarchy can be quite relevant and deterministic in order to impose constraints on @xmath1 , since a displacement up to 95% cl or more may be noted .",
    "it is important to remember that we are taking @xmath57 , in order to investigate the effects of each individual mass hierarchy , and we are not taking @xmath58 free , in order to investigate the possibility of some extra species .",
    "moreover , it is also well known that the tension on the measuremnet of @xmath1 from the local measurement can be reconciled due to already known correlation between the extra relativistic degrees of freedom and @xmath1 .",
    "here , we note that the tension on @xmath1 can be relieved in the direction of local measurements from @xcite , if one considers the nh / ih scheme , or in the direction of planck measurements @xcite via dh scheme , in presence of the cpl model without any possibility of extra degrees of freedom @xmath59 an important feature in the context of dynamical de models .",
    "it has also been shown that the tension can be alleviated from a constant eos that could go beyond ` @xmath60 ' at 68% cl @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : contour - log ] shows the one - dimensional marginalized distribution , and 68% , 95% cl regions for some selected parameters of the logarithmic model . similar to the cpl model here we note that both the nh and ih schemes return similar constraints on the dynamics of the model , and no significant variations on the free parameters of this model have been found for these two neutrino mass hierarchies .",
    "we note that @xmath61 @xmath62 0.499 ev , 0.860 ev , and 0.512 ev at 95% cl for nh , ih , and dh , respectively .",
    "the dh scheme shows considerable shifts on the constraints on the model parameters .",
    "we can note , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , on the best fit values when compared dh to nh ( ih ) , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : contour - jbp ] shows the one - dimensional marginalized distribution , and 68% , 95% cl regions for some selected parameters of the jbp model . following the same trend as observed in the other two dynamic de models , we found that in the nh and ih schemes , jbp model does not present significant variations on the baseline of the paremeters , while the dh scheme shows some different observational results in comapared to nh and ih schemes .",
    "we can assume that this is a general case , and nh and ih return almost the same observational constraints on dynamic de models .",
    "in the jbp context , we note @xmath65 0.499 ev , 0.81 ev , and 0.364 ev at 95% cl for nh , ih , and dh , respectively . here",
    ", we note that @xmath66 and @xmath67 , comparing dh to nh ( ih ) , respectively .",
    "we can see that the variations for jbp are positive and in contrary to the cpl and logarithmic parameterizations .",
    "the jbp model also presents greater variations on the parameters that describe the properties of the dark energy , in particularly for @xmath30 .",
    "analogously the discussion on the tension in the measurement of @xmath1 remains same for both logarithmic and jbp models as in cpl model .",
    "here , we have the similar constraints on @xmath1 for both the logarithmic and jbp models , within the three schemes of mass hierarchy",
    ". therefore , these models can also assuage the tension on @xmath1 in presence of three different neutrino mass hierarchies .",
    "finally , figures [ fig : wz1 ] , [ fig : wz2 ] , and [ fig : wz3 ] show the qualitative evolution of the eos at 1@xmath10 cl respectively for cpl , logarithmic , and jbp models , influenced by the neutrino mass hierarchy schemes . in the three figures ,",
    "the gray shaded region indicates the 1@xmath10 uncertainty region from nh .",
    "the lines in green , and blue represent the borders at 1@xmath10 cl for ih , and dh , respectively .",
    "the solid , dotted , and dashed black lines respectively represent the best fit curves of the eos of de for nh , ih , and dh .",
    "evidently , we can see that the dynamics depends on the neutrino mass hierarchies .",
    "as expected , for all three dynamical de models , both nh and ih return a similar dynamics for the eos ( the dotted and solid curves are very close to each other as seen from figures [ fig : wz1 ] , [ fig : wz2 ] , and [ fig : wz3 ] ) , with a predominance for a quintessence behavior than the phantom behavior , although the possibility of phantom behavior can not be excluded in strict sense ( in fact cpl and jbp show a clear indication on phantom behavior ) .",
    "the dh forecast opens a longer interval for @xmath27 , with a possibility for a phantom or quintessence dynamics , but the phantom behavior is much dominant than its quintessence behavior as seen from the figures .",
    "therefore , based on the analysis performed in three well known and most used dynamical de models , in general , one can assume that different choices for the neutrino mass hierarchy can return different properties in de , and this might be considered as an opening direction to closely look into other dark energy models .",
    "the presence of massive neutrinos is an essential piece in the dynamics of the universe , and it is known that their properties can correlate in different ways with other cosmological parameters . in this work we have measured the effects of massive neutrinos via three different neutrino hierarchies , namely nh , ih , and dh , on the cosmological scenarios where de offers a dynamical character .",
    "we consider three well known and most used dynamical de models represented by cpl , logarithmic and jbp parametrizations .",
    "the models have been constrained using the most current observational data from cmb , snia , bao , rsd , wl , cc , and @xmath1 . from the combined analysis of these observational data , we have found that nh and ih return very similar constraints over the entire baseline parameters of the models while in contrast , the dh scheme significantly differs both from nh and ih , where in general the deviations on the cosmological parameters exceed 1@xmath10 cl .",
    "so , it is clearly evident that the mass hierarchy is relevant and deterministic in order to impose constraints on the de properties .",
    "additionally , we also found that the models can also aleviate the tension on @xmath1 with an effective number of active neutrino species @xmath57 .",
    "since the dynamic properties of the de may depend effectively on a given mass hierarchy , thus the determination of mass scheme from future neutrino experiments can have important consequences on a possible dynamical character of the dark energy .",
