    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the best - motivated extensions of the standard model ( sm )  @xcite .",
    "there have been numerous studies of strategies by which superpartners may be discovered at the lhc .",
    "the susy reach of the lhc is usually expressed in terms of the masses of coloured gluinos and squarks , expected to be the most copiously produced sparticles  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the focus has shifted to how well sparticle properties can be determined at the lhc , with the most attention being paid to sparticle masses , the underlying motivation being that knowledge of the sparticle spectrum will lead us to the mechanism by which sm superpartners acquire their masses .",
    "the problem , of course , is that it is not possible to construct mass peaks because every susy event ( in @xmath17-parity conserving susy models that we focus upon in this paper ) includes two undetected neutralinos ( @xmath18 ) , which we take to be the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "the variable @xmath19 constructed from transverse energy ( @xmath20 ) provides a rough measure of the mass of the lighter of gluinos / squarks  @xcite .",
    "the end point of the same flavour , opposite - sign dilepton mass spectrum , first mentioned in  ref.@xcite , yields a precise measurement of the _ mass difference _ , @xmath21 , between neutralinos .",
    "hinchliffe , paige and collaborators  @xcite pioneered systematic studies of the information that may be gleaned from end - points of a variety of mass distributions in lhc event samples with cuts to select out susy events over sm backgrounds , and showed that ( modulo some discrete ambiguities ) in favourable cases with two - body decay cascades , it is sometimes possible to also construct the masses , rather than just mass differences : in this connection , see also ref .",
    "since then , other techniques have been suggested to obtain sparticle masses .",
    "these include the use of the @xmath9 variable  @xcite , its cousins @xmath22 and related variables  @xcite , as well as their generalization to asymmetric decays  @xcite , the so - called matrix element method  @xcite , the presence of kinematic cusps in distributions  @xcite , or through multi - lepton channels  @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a new way of measuring masses for the case of event topologies with one step cascade decays of the type : @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the parent particles ( squarks in our analysis ) initially produced in the hard scattering , @xmath25s are the invisible ( lightest susy particles , lsp ) daughters of @xmath24 , while each @xmath26 manifests itself as a jet in the detector .",
    "none of the existing mass measurement methods allow for a separate determination of both the parent and daughter masses from just the process ( [ eq : cdec ] ) .",
    "for instance , the much - studied @xmath9 method yields a measure of @xmath27 which , only if @xmath28 , provides a measurement of the parent mass @xcite . if more complicated decay chains @xcite or several production processes @xcite are accessible , it may be possible to extract the individual parent and daughter masses .",
    "the method presented here offers an alternative way of determining @xmath29 ( also in the regime @xmath28 ) from the dijet invariant mass distribution , and relies on completely distinct kinematical features from the standard @xmath9 procedure .    in our analysis",
    ", we assume that the daughter lsp is a bino - like neutralino @xmath18 , while the parent is a right squark , which dominantly decay via @xmath30 .",
    "would dominantly decay to charged or neutral winos .",
    "since the sm daughters of the chargino decays would be very soft , the analysis we describe for @xmath31 would then apply to @xmath32 . ]",
    "thus our signal from right squark pair production is exactly two hard jets , no isolated leptons or photons , together with missing transverse energy ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "it has been pointed out  @xcite , and since confirmed @xcite that sm backgrounds to this signal can be controlled by requiring acollinear jets , even without the use of @xmath33 .",
    "if gluinos are marginally heavier than squarks , they decay to squarks and an undetectably soft jet , so that @xmath34 production then adds to the squark dijet signal .",
    "if gluinos are light enough so that squarks dominantly decay to gluinos , we do not have the dijet plus @xmath33 signal , and our analysis does not apply . aside from our assumption about the mass ordering between gluinos and squarks and @xmath35",
    ", we endeavor to leave our analysis as model - independent as possible , and at the same time realistic in that we include all complications due to contamination from other susy processes and sm background .",
    "we will see below that in addition to yielding @xmath8 our analysis may also serve to approximately constrain @xmath36 .",
    "the cross section for pair production of @xmath31 is determined by susy qcd just in terms of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , independent of the details of any model . for the mass ordering of interest to us , the decay @xmath38 is kinematically suppressed , so that right squarks dominantly decay to the ( bino - like ) lsp .",
    "susy contamination to the acollinear dijet signal is , of course , model - dependent . for definiteness , we assume gaugino mass unification at the gut scale , take @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and use the scalar mass unification condition @xmath41 as a guide to the slepton mass .",
    "these choices have little effect on the right squark signal other than restricting the gluino to be not much heavier than the squark , since otherwise the slepton becomes too light .",
    "we use isajet v7.78  @xcite for our simulation of the susy signal at the lhc .",

    "when the gluino is heavier than the squark the @xmath68 decay channel opens up , and @xmath34 events can pass the @xmath69 cut if the @xmath70 forms a very soft jet , below the jet @xmath20 threshold .",

    "one reduces the relevance of @xmath91 contamination . while the subtraction of the @xmath92 background is not as simple as for the background from @xmath93 production , we may expect that the @xmath89 signal can be measured in a control region ( such as the dijet + 1 lepton channel ) and then extrapolated to the signal region ( dijet + 0 leptons ) . in our analysis , just as for the @xmath93 background , we assume that we can use alpgen @xcite to simulate and subsequently subtract the @xmath92 background from the total di - jet sample , but include the corresponding statistical uncertainty in the evaluation of @xmath94 when performing our fits to extract sparticle masses",

    "although we include _ all _ susy events in this sample , about 40% ( @xmath102% ) of the events come from squark pair production in frame ( _ a _ ) where the gluino - squark mass gap , @xmath103 , is just 17  gev , ( in frame ( _ b _ ) with @xmath104  gev ) with the bulk of the remaining events arising from @xmath105 pair production . in the former case , although squark production seems to be subdominant , we should remember that the gluino decays into a squark and a ( very soft ) jet , so that these contaminating @xmath106 events have very similar kinematics as squark - pair events .",
    "hence @xmath106 events do not interfere with our strategy to extract the squark mass and , in fact , help in that they increase the signal sample that we can use .",
    "the gluino production is suppressed and @xmath107 remains the only viable signal . ]",
    "the gray scale on the scatter plot shows how the events are distributed by invariant mass .",
    "we see that the bulk of events with low invariant dijet mass @xmath5 have small values of @xmath108 and ( because of the @xmath4 cut ) correspondingly large values of @xmath109 .",
    "this is not surprising since ( except when both jets are very forward ) our jet cone algorithm generally requires the jets to have a spatial angular separation between them , and precludes the smallest invariant masses if @xmath108 is also sizeable .",
    "despite the fact that @xmath53 is soft , these events readily satisfy the @xmath110 requirement because @xmath5 is also small .",
    "relative to these events with the lowest values of @xmath5 , events with somewhat larger dijet masses are possible if _ either _ @xmath108 or the space angle between the jets is increased . if @xmath5 becomes larger because @xmath108 is increased , the @xmath110 cut is still satisfied .",
    "however , events with increased values of @xmath5 due to a larger angular separation but where @xmath108 remains small have smaller values of @xmath110 , and so a reduced efficiency for passing the @xmath111 cut .",
    "we emphasize that _ without the @xmath4 cut _ these `` intermediate @xmath5 events '' would also be obtained for smaller values of @xmath109 and correspondingly larger values of @xmath108 that would readily satisfy @xmath112 .",
    "finally , events with large values of @xmath108 close to the @xmath113 line naturally tend to have high values of dijet masses ( as evidenced by the lack of dark points in this region of the scatter plot ) as well as of @xmath110 . of course",
    ", events with exactly back - to - back jets are _ always _ eliminated by the @xmath110 cut ( and also the @xmath114 cut ) , which is why this cut is an efficient veto against qcd dijet events .    to recap ,",
    "these qualitative arguments suggest that , compared to events with very small or relatively large values of @xmath5 , events with intermediate values of dijet invariant mass are less likely to satisfy a hard cut on @xmath4 simultaneously with the requirement @xmath115 .",
    "the dip in the di - jet invariant mass distribution near @xmath116  gev in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter](_a _ ) is a manifestation of exactly this feature .",
    "this deficit of intermediate events , as we will see below , which plays an important role in the extraction of @xmath8 from the di - jet data , does not show up in the 1  tev case in frame ( _ b _ ) . to better understand this",

    "we show that with @xmath117 , high mass events with large opening angle between the jets , as well as low mass events with a small opening angle between the jets readily satisfy that @xmath112 requirement .",
    "we find , however , that intermediate mass events where the second jet is roughly perpendicular to the hard jet ( in the squark cm frame ) _ can never _ satisfy the @xmath110 cut if @xmath118 .",
    "although our analysis in the appendix neglects events from @xmath34 production for which the kinematics is slightly different because of the soft jet from gluino decay , and also any qcd radiation , it nevertheless confirms the general features that we inferred from our qualitative arguments of this section .",
    "more importantly , it fixes the lower limit on @xmath4 in order for the dip to become apparent in the @xmath5 distribution to be @xmath119 if @xmath120 .",
    "we now understand why we do not see a corresponding dip in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] ( _ b _ )  the @xmath7  gev cut is not hard enough , and the would - be dip region is populated by events with not - so - large values of @xmath109 , and concomitantly larger values of @xmath108 that then pass the @xmath121 cut .",
    "indeed , we have verified that by hardening the @xmath4 cut to 1  tev we recover the dip also in this case .",
    "we have not shown this because the event rate then becomes too small ; _",
    "i.e. _ despite the appearance of the dip the reduced event rate does not lead to any improvement in the determination of @xmath8 , at least for an integrated luminosity of 100  fb@xmath6 .",

    "we will see below that the squark mass can be extracted with greater precision if the integrated luminosity is sufficient for the implementation of a large enough @xmath4 cut so that the dip structure in the di - jet mass distribution ( which is very sensitive to @xmath8 ) is clearly evident .",

    "the virtual almost - on - shell - squark then decays via @xmath137 and the fit is almost unaffected because events from squark decays to gluinos can not be kinematically distinguished from events with squarks decaying to the lsp . however , as the gluino - squark mass difference increases , ( 1 )  gluino decays of squarks become more significant and begin eating into the branching fraction for lsp decays , and ( 2 )  the quark daughter of the squark becomes harder and so more likely to be detected .",
    "indeed , if all @xmath138 decays would be vetoed by our jet - multiplicity cut , all that would happen would be a loss of statistics , causing the ellipse to widen , and ultimately open up , for lower values of @xmath36 .",

    "these effects combine and together lead to an increase of @xmath131 .",

    "clearly , the di - jet mass method is inapplicable if the squark is much heavier than the gluino , since then the di - jet signal from squark production is very small . in this regime , @xmath9 is clearly superior as it potentially offers the possibility of determining both @xmath36 and @xmath155 . * if @xmath163 , and the integrated luminosity of the lhc is large enough to enable us to utilize the dip structure in the @xmath5 mass distribution , the two procedures yield the same information ( _ i.e. _ a measure of @xmath8 if @xmath164 ) , and with comparable precision .",
    "the di - jet mass distribution also offers the possibility of constraining @xmath36 .",
    "this can then be compared with a direct determination of @xmath36 from the independent multi - jet event sample using , for instance , @xmath165 .",
    "consistency of the gluino mass obtained from these _ independent _ data samples would bolster the case that the new physics is indeed supersymmetry . * in our analysis",
    ", we have assumed that the squarks that lead to di - jet events ( mostly @xmath166 and @xmath167 for msugra ) are essentially degenerate in mass .",
    "if these had a small but significant mass splitting , the shape of the @xmath5 distribution would likely be distorted and we would extract some sort of averaged mass .",
    "the @xmath9 analysis , on the other hand , relies on an end - point ( which the mass splitting may smear ) and would yield the larger of the squark masses . * our method for extracting",
    "@xmath8 relies only on the jet energies and angles , whereas @xmath9 also requires @xmath33 .",
    "while the jet energy scale is likely to be the largest experimental systematic uncertainty for mass extraction from the @xmath5 distribution , the @xmath9 procedure relies on the entire detector , and so is likely to have different experimental systematics .",
    "we have proposed a new way to determine the squark mass using templates to fit the _ shape _ of the invariant mass distribution of acollinear dijet events at the lhc .",
    "standard model backgrounds are suppressed by cuts on @xmath168 , @xmath169 and veto of isolated leptons .",
    "our analysis is independent of many details of the underlying model , and requires only that at least some types of squarks have a large branching ratio for direct decays to the lsp .",
    "it yields a measure of the squark mass if @xmath170 .",
    "while the signal may have sizable @xmath33 , imposing a @xmath33 cut does not lead to a qualitative improvement on the precision with which the squark mass is determined .",
    "we emphasize that the squark mass is determined by a fit to only the shape of the signal di - jet invariant mass spectrum .",
    "if @xmath171 , the signal may also get a significant contribution from @xmath34 production which , like squark pair production , is fixed by susy qcd in terms of just @xmath8 and @xmath36 .",
    "we do not make use of the magnitude of the signal which would depend on model - dependent branching fractions for squark and gluino decay .",
    "indeed , the gluino contamination and/or the dependence of the squark @xmath20 spectrum on @xmath36 also allows us to constrain @xmath36 , albeit with considerably lower precision than @xmath8 .    as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : sqmass ] and in more detail in the appendix , the cuts on @xmath110 and @xmath4 serve a dual role . aside from background reduction , with appropriate choices",
    "@xmath112 ( the natural value to discriminate the signal from mismeasured qcd di - jet events ) and @xmath172 cuts , we have shown that signal events with intermediate values of @xmath5 pass the cuts with reduced efficiency compared to events with high and low di - jet masses .",
    "the resulting dip structure in the di - jet mass distribution ( see the inset in fig .  [ fig : scatter]_a _ ) is very sensitive to the value of @xmath8 , and so increases the precision with which the squark mass can be extracted if the integrated luminosity is high enough to allow the implementation of a hard enough cut on @xmath4 .",
    "we have performed two case studies , each with the gluino just slightly heavier than the squark , to investigate the precision with which it is possible to extract the squark mass from the dijet distribution .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] .",
    "we see that for the @xmath96  gev case for which the dip structure in the di - jet mass distribution should be visible in lhc experiments with an integrated luminosity of 100  fb@xmath6 , the squark mass is constrained to lie between 630 - 690  gev at @xmath134 , while for a 1  tev squark for which the 100  fb@xmath6 is not sufficient to utilize the dip structure , the corresponding range is 935 - 1040  gev .",
    "we find that in the former case the precision that we obtain is essentially the same as that we would obtain using @xmath9 , but the systematics of the two measurements are quite different .",
    "the method that we have proposed using the analysis of di - jet events from supersymmetry to determine the squark mass can be generalized to other beyond the sm theories and used to determine the characteristic heavy particle mass .",
    "the invariant mass construction relies only on kinematical cuts , the assumption of a low mass of the stable ( invisible ) particle and a large enough branching ratio for the two body decay of the heavy particle into a jet and the invisible lighter particle .",

    "events with an azimuthal angle separation @xmath114 larger ( smaller ) than 1.5 are depicted by stars ( dots ) . the points cluster at high @xmath5 values ( @xmath224 ) , as expected , since the squark boost causes the @xmath221 distribution to peak at @xmath225 .",
