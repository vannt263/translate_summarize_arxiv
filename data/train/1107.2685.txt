    "our sun has an eleven - year magnetic activity cycle , which is thought to be sustained by the dynamo motion of internal ionized plasma , i.e. , a transformation of kinetic energy to magnetic energy @xcite .",
    "our understanding of the solar dynamo has significantly improved during the past fifty years , and some kinematic studies can now reproduce solar magnetic features such as equatorward migration of sunspots and poleward migration of the magnetic field . the most important mechanism of the solar dynamo is the @xmath1 effect , the bending of pre - existing poloidal magnetic fields by differential rotation and the generation of toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "thus , the distribution of the differential rotation in the convection zone is a significant factor for the solar dynamo . using helioseismology",

    "this means that the angular velocity difference @xmath0 increases and the relative difference @xmath6 decreases with increases in the stellar rotation rate @xmath2 .    in this paper , we investigate differential rotation in rapidly rotating stars using a mean field framework .",
    "our study is based on the work of @xcite , in which he suggests the importance of the role of the subadiabatic layer below the convection zone in order to maintain a non - taylor - proudman state in the sun .",
    "the aim of this paper is to use a mean field model to analyze firstly the dependence of the morphology of differential rotation on stellar angular velocity , and secondly the physical process which determines the observable angular velocity difference @xmath7 . according to our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first work which systematically discusses the application of rempel s ( 2005b ) solar model to stars .",
    "other research adopts another approach to the use of mean field models for the analysis of differential rotation in rapidly - rotating stars . in these studies ,",
    "the non - taylor - proudman state is sustained by anisotropy of turbulent thermal conduction .",

    "[ rapid ] shows the results of our calculations which correspond to cases 1 - 5 in table [ param ] .",

    "we call it the non - taylor - proudman parameter ( hereafter the ntp parameter ) , which is expressed as @xmath132 where @xmath2 is the angular velocity of the radiative zone .",
    "when the ntp parameter is zero , differential rotation is in the taylor - proudman state .",
    "conversely , differential rotation is far from the taylor - proudman state with a large absolute value of the ntp parameter .",
    "the value of the ntp parameter with various stellar angular velocities is shown in fig .",
    "the ntp monotonically decreases with increases in stellar angular velocity .",
    "these results indicate that with large stellar angular velocity values , differential rotation approaches the taylor - proudman state .",
    "these results are counter - intuitive , however , since we do not expect differential rotation to approach the taylor - proudman state with increasing stellar angular velocity values , since the @xmath38 effect , which is a driver of the deviation from the taylor - proudman state , is proportional to stellar angular velocity @xmath2 .",
    "these are the most significant findings of this paper , so hereafter in this section we discuss these unexpected results .",
    "we next discuss the temperature difference between the equator and the pole at the base of the convection zone ( @xmath133 ) .",

    "although the temperature difference monotonously increases with larger stellar angular velocity values , it is not enough to make the rotational profile largely deviate from the taylor - proudman state .",

    "( [ therm01 ] ) : @xmath137 the inertial term and the diffusion term are neglected here .",
    "this equation indicates that , for a given value of the ntp , we need an entropy gradient proportional to @xmath138 .",

    "the latitudinal entropy gradient in rapidly rotating stars is so small that differential rotation stays close to the taylor - proudman state . in our model",
    ", meridional flow generates latitudinal entropy gradient at the base of the convection zone .",

    "the reason why differential rotation in rapidly rotation stars is close to the taylor - proudman state is that meridional flow does not become fast with large stellar angular velocity values .",
    "we interpret the result that the speed of meridional flow does not depend on stellar angular velocity in our model as follows .",
    "with large values of stellar angular velocity , more angular momentum is transported by the @xmath38-effect ( note that the @xmath38-effect is proportional to @xmath2 in equation ( [ amp_lambda ] ) ) , so meridional flow obtains more energy from differential rotation .",
    "the energy gain does not result in an increase in speed because of the associated enhancement of the coriolis force , which bends the meridional flow in the longitudinal direction .",
    "another explanation is possible in terms of angular momentum transport .",
    "the angular momentum fluxes from both meridional flow and the reynolds stress ( @xmath38 effect ) must be balanced in a steady state .",
    "the former is proportional to @xmath141 and the latter is proportional to @xmath2 , where @xmath142 is the amplitude of meridional flow .",
    "therefore , meridional flow does not depend on stellar angular velocity @xcite .",
    "our results ( fig . [ vari_some ] ) indicate that with a larger stellar angular velocity ( case 2 ) , the above mechanism does not generate fast meridional flow .",

    "note that the difference between the values of the ntp parameters with an adiabatic and those with a superadiabatic convection zone decreases as the stellar angular velocity increases , since the generation of entropy gradient by the subadiabtic layer becomes ineffective with a larger stellar angular velocity .",
    "we have investigated differential rotation in rapidly rotating stars using a mean field model .",
    "this work is significant because it can be used as a base for further research on stellar activity cycles , which are most likely caused by the dynamo action of differential rotation in the stellar convection zone .",
    "first , we investigated the morphology of differential rotation in rapidly rotating stars .",
    "although more angular momentum is transported by convection with larger stellar angular velocity , the coriolis force is stronger than in the solar case , so meridional flow does not be fast . in our model , meridional flow generates latitudinal entropy gradient in the subadiabatically stratified overshoot region . since the meridional flow is not fast , the entropy gradient is insufficient to move differential rotation far from the taylor - proudman state in rapidly rotating stars . as a result ,",
    "the differential rotation of stars with large stellar angular velocity is close to the taylor - proudman state .",
    "the temperature difference between latitudes is probably controlled by two important factors , i.e. , the subadiabatic layer below the convection zone and anisotropic heat transport caused by turbulence and rotation .",
    "we suggest that the former is important in slow rotators like the sun , and the latter in rapid rotators . the subadiabatic - layer effect is included in our model , while anisotropic heat transport is not .",
    "we found that the effect of the subadiabatic layer can generate a temperature difference @xmath164 in the solar case , which moderately increases with higher rotation speeds , and @xmath165 in case @xmath166 .",
    "the three - dimensional simulations by @xcite include a self - consistent calculation of anisotropy of turbulent thermal transport but not the subadiabatic layer at the bottom boundary . in their calculation",
    "@xmath135 is most likely smaller than @xmath167 in the solar case , since they can not reproduce the solar differential rotation only with anisotropy of thermal transport .",
    "also , @xmath168 in case @xmath169 , which is larger than the case with the subadiabatic layer .",
    "we speculate that anisotropic heat transport becomes more significant in rapidly rotating stars .",
    "there is also a possibility that our calculated entropy gradient at the base of the convection zone can be used as a boundary condition for a self - consistent three dimensional simulation of stellar convection @xcite .",
    "note that differential rotation in rapidly rotating stars in is not in the taylor - proudman state when anisotropy of turbulent thermal conductivity is included .",
    "a future study of the simultaneous effects of the attached subadiabatic layer beneath convection zone and anisotoropy of the turbulent thermal conductivity on stellar differential rotation would provide a better understanding of stellar differential rotation .",
    "next , we investigated angular velocity difference at the surface .",
    "the @xmath38 effect causes spatial difference in the rotation profile , while turbulent viscosity reduces the difference .",
    "angular velocity difference @xmath0 is determined in eq .",
    "( [ deltaomega ] ) , which is then used to investigate differential rotation in rapidly rotating stars .",
    "since stellar rotation is close to the taylor - proudman state , and the radiative core is rotating rigidly , differential rotation is concentrated at low latitudes with large stellar angular velocity .",
    "this concentration leads to a small @xmath151 in eq .",
    "( [ deltaomega ] ) .",
    "therefore , only at low latitudes our model is consistent with stellar observations .",
    "our conclusions are as follows : ( 1 ) differential rotation approaches the taylor - proudman state when stellar rotation is faster than solar rotation .",
    "( 2 ) entropy gradient generated by the attached subadiabatic layer beneath the convection zone becomes relatively small with a large stellar angular velocity .",
    "( 3 ) turbulent viscosity and turbulent angular momentum transport determine the spatial difference of angular velocity @xmath0 . ( 4 ) the results of our mean field model can explain observations of stellar differential rotation .",
    "our future work will focus on the stellar mhd dynamo .",
    "several investigations have been conducted on the stellar dynamo using a kinematic dynamo framework . since , under such a framework",
    ", only the magnetic induction equation is solved using a given velocity field , solving a linear equation , such analysis does not give sufficient information on the strength of the dynamo - generated stellar magnetic field . to obtain the full amplitude of the stellar magnetic field ,",
    "the feedback to the velocity field is required , i.e. , an mhd framework . adopting a similar approach to @xcite",
    ", we can use the results of this paper to investigate the strength of the stellar magnetic field .",
    "recent observations of the strength of the magnetic field generated by stellar differential rotation have been conducted using spectroscopy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a comparison of these observations and numerical calculations of the stellar dynamo could give new insight into the stellar magnetic field .",
    "finally , our stellar mhd dynamo study would also contribute to the understanding of recent investigations into stellar magnetic cyclic activity periods @xcite .",
