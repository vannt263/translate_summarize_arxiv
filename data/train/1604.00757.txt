    "a striking and important example of the phenomenon which completely alters the conditions for propagation of the electromagnetical waves through a medium is the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite-@xcite which consist in making the medium transparent for a pulse resonant with some atomic transition by switching on a strong field resonant with two unpopulated levels .",
    "generic eit scheme consists of a gas comprised of three - level atoms in so - called @xmath0 configuration that are driven by a strong control field and a weak probe one on separate transition .",
    "if the frequencies of probe and control fields are in two - photon resonance the atoms are driven into a dark - state that is decoupled from the light fields .",
    "this mechanism creates the transparency window in the absorption spectrum of the probe field irradiating the medium , and the steep normal dispersion at the center of the dip of the absorption and results in significant reduction of the group velocity of the signal and enhancement of nonlinear interaction . by admitting the control fields to adiabatically change in time it has become possible to dynamically change the optical properties of the medium while the probe pulse travels inside it @xcite",
    "; in particular one can not only reduce the pulse group velocity but even stop the pulse by switching the control field off . by switching it again",
    "one can release the stored pulse , preserving the phase relations . during the last twenty years or so",
    ", eit and other related to its phenomena were studied both theoretically and experimentally and more and more sophisticated variation of atomic configurations and coupling fields have been considered @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a tripod - type four - level configuration , the classical analog of which will be considered in this paper , consists of three ground levels coupled with one upper level . even at a first glance",
    "one can see that this configuration , due to an additional unpopulated long - living lower state coupled by control or second signal beam with upper state , is richer than generic @xmath0 scheme and gives an opportunity to study different new aspect of pulse propagation .",
    "we will focus on the situation of one signal coupling populated ground level with the upper level and two strong control fields coupled with two low - lying empty levels .",
    "this medium exhibits in general two transparency windows of different widths and different slopes of normal dispersion curve @xcite , what means that the group velocity in the two windows can be different . extensive studies of possibilities of stopping , performing manipulations on stored classical light in order to obtain the desired properties of the released pulse or pulses were done by one raczyski _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "medium of atoms in tripod configuration , due to high degree of controllability , may also play the role of a light - controlled beam - splitting system in the time domain , allows one to realize the hong - ou - mandel interference , one - and two - qubit gates , working on atomic excitations due to stores polarized photons and processes time entangled pulses ( light bins ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "recently the storage of a signal in metamaterial has been demonstrated @xcite .",

    "our paper is a contribution to this area .",
    "some aspects of the atom - field interaction can be described by classical theory so we attempt to present the classical systems that mimic tripod configuration and explore the signal storage in such media .",
    "as it was pointed out , tripod scheme allows one to perform manipulations on the signal pulse stopped in the medium , and after some time to release it in one or more parts , preserving information of the incident field , including its amplitude , phase and polarization stage . a classical scheme that mimics tripod has been investigated recently by bai _",
    "et al _ @xcite in the context of double eit and plasmon - induced transparency @xcite , but all these papers considered two weak propagating fields coupling populated low - lying levels in the medium dressed by one control beam .",
    "studies of eit in metamaterials of plasmonic tripod system has also been performed by xu _",

    "we investigate the eit in classical tripod medium built of three rlc circuits coupled by two capacitances with electric resistors and alternating voltage source , or alternatively by several metal strips .",
    "our model could be practically realized using planar complementary metamaterials in which generic eit was sucesfully demonstrated by li _",

    "is discussed and the means of control over the medium dispersion are explained .",
