    "spectroscopic observations with the space - based observatories in soft x - ray and extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) regions provide valuable diagnostic means for understandings of the astrophysical hot plasma .",
    "the soft x - ray and euv regions contain rich emission lines that can be used for determinations of plasma properties and element abundances over a wide temperature range  ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) .",
    "the emissions are mainly from l - shell transitions of abundant astrophysical elements and m - shell transitions of iron ions .",
    "the most abundant element  fe , shows a forest - like emission lines at the soft x - ray and euv regions in the solar and stellar observations .",
    "so the spectral analyses of l - shell iron ions received strong attentions for astronomers and physicians .",
    "however , the emissions lines mainly span 618   ( @xmath1 , here @xmath2 is main quantum number ) and 100350   ( @xmath3 ) regions .",
    "so previous space observatories , e.g. _ skylab _ ( covering 649   ) , solar euv rocket telescope and spectrograph ( serts , 170450   ) , extreme ultraviolet explore ( _ euve _ , covering 70760   with a resolution of @xmath4=0.42.5  )@xcite , and solar ultraviolet measurements of emitted radiation ( sumer , covering 5001610   with resolution power of @xmath5  =  1900040000 ) instrument on soho mission etc . , probe into the universe in the two wavelength ranges .",
    "however , the spectra between 4090   has received a scant attention even in solar measurements .",
    "though the new generation of space mission of _ chandra x - ray observatory _ covers wavelength range of 1.2176 with higher resolution of @xmath00.06@xcite , most researches focus on observations below @xmath035 provided by high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) ( with @xmath4=0.012 and 0.023 ) on _ chandra _ and reflected grating spectrometer ( rgs ) ( with @xmath4=0.05 ) on _ xmm - newton _ @xcite .",
    "this is due to the spectral region is spanned by @xmath6 transition lines of highly charge iron ions .",
    "the region of 4090 contains more lines than currently identified , as graphically illustrated by _",
    "spectra of capella @xcite and procyon ( raassen et al .",
    "2002 ) observed with low energy transmission grating spectrometer ( letgs ) .",
    "those unresolvable weak lines form the pseudo - continuum emissions , and raise the  background \" level for strong features , and increase the uncertainty to their interpretation .",
    "contribution to these unidentified lines may come from l - shell ions of magnesium , silicon , sulfur , argon , calcium , iron and nickel .",
    "nevertheless , the uncertainties of wavelength and cross section of excitation , ionization and recombination are more significant for l - shell ions than k - shell ions of above listed elements .",
    "the associated uncertainties greatly impede our efforts to fully understand astrophysical x - ray sources , such as the shape of emission measure distribution , element abundances , and spatial structures . so laboratory studies , using , for example , electron - beam ion traps ( ebit ) , storage rings , tokamaks , and intense laser pulses , are very necessary to provide accurate atomic data that can be incorporated into astrophysical spectral synthesis codes .",
    "the interaction of intense , sub - picosecond laser pulses with solid targets allows the generation of hot plasmas with a temperature between 50  ev and 1  kev , which is the typical temperature range of stellar coronae , and a density of @xmath7@xmath8  @xmath9 .",
    "the laser plasma is one of ground x - ray and euv sources .",
    "this type plasma plays an important role in various fields of research such as astrophysics , inertial confinement fusion , etc ( lindl et al .",
    "2004 ) . its x - ray and euv radiation can be used to determine plasma conditions and micro - processes .",
    "for example the density can be obtained from line broadening effects , and the temperature can be estimated from satellites of h - like ly@xmath10 and he - like resonance ( 1s2p  @xmath11p@xmath121s@xmath13  @xmath11s@xmath14 ) lines .",
    "the well controlled laser plasma can also be used to benchmark the kinetic codes @xcite , and simulate some astrophysical phenomena .",
    "recently , many efforts have been made in laboratories to provide accurate atomic data and validate the simulation codes . @xcite and other groups @xcite investigated the x - ray emissions of k - shell ions of argon , using the intense pulsed laser , electron beam ion traps ( ebit ) and tokamaks .",
    "independent methods such as thomson scattering and infrared interferometer measurement for temperature and density , have been used to benchmark the @xmath15 and @xmath16 constrained by spectroscopy , and a good agreement is obtained .",
    "lepson et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2005 ) further investigated the soft x - ray emissions of l - shell ions of argon ( 2050   ) and sulfur ( 2075 ) using the lawrence livermore ebit - i and ebit - ii , and graphically illustrated larger uncertainties in available atomic data .",
    "@xcite measured emissions of sulfur in wavelength range of 190400   by beam - foil spectroscopy in the heavy ion research facility at lanzhou .    in this paper , the experimental setup and the calibration for the soft x - ray and euv spectrometer are described in sect .  2 .",
    "results and discussions are presented in sect .",
    "3 . in this section ,",
    "the soft x - ray spectra of highly charged silicon ions , modelling to the spectra , and the comparison between the present calculation and the kelly database are described in detail .",
    "finally , the conclusions is outlined in sect .",
    "the experiment was carried out using the xtreme light ii ( xl - ii ) laser system at the institute of physics ( iop ) , chinese academy of sciences ( peng et al .",
    "2004 , li et al .",
    "the laser system has an output energy up to 650mj in 30fs pulses at 796  nm .",
    "the laser beam was focused by an @xmath17 lens to a dimension of @xmath026@xmath1824  @xmath19 m on the surface of a planner target , which is consist of three materials including copper , plastic and silicon as shown by the left - top panel of fig .  1 .",
    "the copper is used for collimation , while the plastic is used for wavelength calibration in the selected wavelength range . a grazing - incidence flat field grating spectrometer with varied spacing grating ( average groove density is 1200  @xmath20/mm ) , was adopted to disperse the radiation .",
    "a cooled ccd camera ( running at -24  @xmath21c ) is used for readout of the spectrograph .",
    "the ccd chip has 2048@xmath18512  pixels with each of @xmath013.5@xmath1813.5  @xmath19m@xmath13 and thus , the ccd total surface area is about 28@xmath187  mm@xmath13 .",
    "the detail description refers to the work of liu et al .",
    "the spectrometer can cover soft x - ray and extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) region ( 40400   ) by sliding the ccd camera along the dispersion plane . in the present single setting ,",
    "the wavelength coverage is 40180   , which is the shortest wavelength range covered by the designed spectrometer .",
    "the spectral resolution is about @xmath220.3 over 4090   .",
    "figure 1 shows the experimental layout .",
    "the laser beam with energy of 90  mj and pulse duration of 200  fs was focused onto the target in direction of 45@xmath21 to the target normal , with intensity of @xmath23  w / cm@xmath13 .",
    "firstly , the focused laser irradiates the plastic . as shown by the ccd spectral image in fig.1 , there is a slight rotation between pixel rows and the dispersion direction .",
    "a program is compiled to correct this rotational misalignment before summing over the pixel channels .",
    "additionally , a clear discrete band is observed in direction being perpendicular to the grating dispersion .",
    "this is due to the toroidal mirror placed before the entrance slit .",
    "so the spectra in pixel region of 60260 is selected in summing over the pixel channels .    in order to obtain the dispersion function of the present spectrometer ,",
    "14 well - known lines from highly charged carbon , nitrogen and oxygen ions , and their higher order diffraction covering the whole wavelength range of interest are used , as shown by symbols in fig .  2 .",
    "peak centroids of these emission lines are determined through gaussian fit , which can describe the observed line shape satisfactorily as shown by the inset in fig .  2 .",
    "a full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath03.54.5 pixels is found , corresponding to @xmath250.30.4   .",
    "the measured line width ( @xmath03.5@xmath1813.5=47  @xmath19 m , with each pixel size of 13.5  @xmath19 m ) reflects the width of entrance slit of 50  @xmath19 m .",
    "the wavelength values of the calibration lines were adopted from nist database and the website http://www.pa.uky.edu/@xmath26peter / atomic/. a parabolic polynomial is used to represent the pixel ( @xmath27)-wavelength ( @xmath28 ) relation [ see fig .  2 ] .",
    "the calibration uncertainty is estimated to be 0.11   [ rms value ] over the range of 40180   .",
    "multi - measurements and calibrations reveal that the calibration parameters hold constant .",
    "when the focused laser irradiate on the solid target , rich emission lines are observed , as shown in below image of fig .  1 .",
    "in this work , we pay special attention on the soft x - ray emission spectra in the wavelength range of 4090   , as labelled out by white region in fig .",
    "1 . 10 separate measurements were performed with each measurement of 4 continuous laser pulses irradiating on the target and 30  s accumulation . using the calibration parameters",
    ", we scale all the measurements . fig .",
    "3 illustrates the averaged spectrum and its best - fitting in wavelength range of 4090   . in this region ,",
    "emission lines are dominated by @xmath1 transition lines of si  vi ",
    "si  xii ions .",
    "we separately analyze the 10 spectra , and accurately determine the wavelengths for 53 prominent lines .",
    "a statistical accuracy of 0.005   is obtained for those strong and blend - free lines , as listed in the second column of table 1 .    based upon the theoretical wavelengths and relative line intensities [ explained in the next subsection ] , we identified these emission lines .",
    "the identified wavelength values are partially from our recent calculations  @xcite , nist database and kelly database  @xcite . in the third subsection",
    ", the detailed comparison of the present calculation and the kelly database is given . from table 1 ,",
    "the differences between the measurements and available database are within 0.1   for most emission lines , whereas differences up to 0.3   also appears for some emission lines .",
    "this reveals that detailed structure calculations for l - shell silicon ions by inclusion of large configuration interactions and relativistic effects are necessary .      in soft x - ray region ,",
    "forest - like lines from l - shell ions generally group together or blend each other when the broadening from spectrometers has been considered , as in this case .",
    "besides , large discrepancies of line wavelengths between measurements and calculations have been demonstrated for highly charged sulfur ( @xmath00.3   ) and argon ( @xmath00.1   ) ions .",
    "so the predictions of line intensities are necessary for the line identification .",
    "collisional - radiative ( cr ) models for highly charged si  vi ",
    "si  xii ions are constructed to simulate the experimental spectrum .",
    "the atomic data used to calculate the line intensities , are generated with the flexible atomic code ( fac ) provided by @xcite . a fully relativistic approach based on dirac equation",
    "is used throughout the entire package .",
    "energy levels , transition rates of e1 , e2 , m1 , and m2 types , and electron impact excitation strengths have been revaluated for si  ix  si  xi in our recent work @xcite .",
    "782 , 878 , 312 , 560 , 320 , 350 and 40 energy levels , have been included in predictions of line intensities for si  vi ",
    "si  xii , respectively .",
    "these levels belongs to not only singly excited configurations , but also some doubly excited configurations for accounting for configuration interaction effect as fully as possible .",
    "all possible @xmath29 ( 22 ) and @xmath30 ( 23 , 24 , and 25 ) decay rates , excitations and de - excitations among levels mentioned above have been considered in the present simulation work .",
    "the theoretical spectra have been computed in the steady state equilibrium .",
    "the set of cr equations are solved by normalizing the total level populations of each charge state to 1 .",
    "the theoretical spectrum for each charge stage is calculated at a density of 1.0@xmath1810@xmath31@xmath9 and temperatures of maximum fraction in ionization equilibrium of mazzotta et al .",
    "the calculated line intensities are fold by gaussian profile with fwhm of 0.3   being comparable to the experimental resolution .",
    "the theoretical spectra are normalized by the measured values at 80.353   , 71.425   , 62.052   , 55.569   , 50.278   , 47.670   and 44.135   for si  vi ",
    "si  xii , respectively . as shown in fig .  4",
    ", the simulation satisfactorily reproduces the experimental spectra of highly charged silicon ions .",
    "different color curves indicate the spectra of different charge states . by the comparison ,",
    "most prominent emission lines are identified as given in table 1 .",
    "since the broadening from the entrance slit , the measured line width is about 0.30.4   .",
    "many emission lines of l - shell ions grouped together , as illustrated by the spectra of si  xi ( dashed and/or dotted curves ) in fig .",
    "5-(a ) , so that the line identification is very difficult . in thus case , we usually assign the largest contribution to the emission peak . for example",
    ", we assign the peaks at 46.403 and 47.670   to the @xmath32@xmath33 ( 46.399   ) and @xmath34@xmath35 ( 47.653   ) transitions of si  xi , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that at the density of the laser plasma , more than half an ion s total level population can be in excited levels , and even in doubly excited levels , other than the ground level .",
    "so many lines excited from lowest lying excited levels can be observed , e.g. lines at 46.403   of si  xi , 49.828   of si  x , 55.950   of si  ix etc . due to the high - density effect ,",
    "the spectra of laser plasma is more complicate than the spectra in low density plasmas such as the astrophysical , electron beam ion trap , and tokamak plasmas . in fig .",
    "5-(b ) , we show the spectrum of si  xi at high ( 1.0@xmath1810@xmath31@xmath9 , blue - solid curve ) and low ( 1.0@xmath1810@xmath36@xmath9 , red - solid curve ) electron densities .",
    "the emission line intensities around 47.67   are greatly suppressed , whereas the line intensities around 46.403   are enhanced at the low - density plasma .",
    "this is due to that the emission lines around 47.67   are from higher excited level of @xmath37 configuration . in case of the low - density plasma",
    ", the level population is mainly in the ground level .      based upon the normalization for each charge states [ see caption of fig .  4 ]",
    ", we compare present spectra with the results from kelly database  @xcite . for lines at 46.403 and 49.343",
    " of si  xi , present calculation shows a better agreement with the measurement [ see fig .  4 ] .",
    "moreover , kelly predicted a stronger si  xi line at 50.517   than the present calculation , which blends with an emission line at 50.278   of si  x. by multi - gaussian component fitting , contribution from the two features can be estimated in the measurement at the peak position of 50.50   as listed in table 1 .",
    "the blending results into two peaks around 50.5   in the sum spectrum [ see fig .  6 ] of kelly .",
    "another strong si  xi line at 52.296   is predicted in kelly work , which helps our identification for the peak at 52.291   in the measurement .",
    "however , this emission line is missed in our calculation .    for peak at 51.796   ,",
    "present calculation is higher than the measurement by 30% , whereas kelly database misses lines at this peak position . for the peak at 53.736  ",
    ", the two predictions agree with each other , and well agree with the measurements [ see fig .  4 ] .",
    "kelly predicts a strong line at 54.599   of si  x , which is two times of the present prediction .",
    "the present value is comparable with the measured intensity at 54.705   .",
    "so we assign the emission line to si  x ( 54.599   ) .    for peak around 55.034 , 55.379 , 55.567 , and 55.950   ,",
    "present calculation predicts 4 si  ix lines with intensities being agreement with the measurement .",
    "contributions from a group weak si  x lines ( around 55.969   ) compensates the difference between experiment and prediction of si  ix at the peak of 55.950   .",
    "kelly database further predicts a si  x line ( 55.096   ) at the peak of 55.034   , which results a large deviation at the peak at 55.034   . for the peak at 55.567 and 55.950   ,",
    "kelly s values are lower than the measurement by @xmath040% , and no other weak blending . for the peak at 59.088   kelly and this work predict a strong line at 59.004   . another important contribution from si  ix line at 58.906   is estimated in this work , whereas kelly predicts another line of si  viii ( 58.885   ) being higher than present value by factors .",
    "the two work predict a strong si  vii line close to the peak position ( 59.088   ) , which results into the large difference between the sum spectra and the measurement at this wavelength [ see fig .",
    "6 ] .    for the peaks at 61.256 and 62.052   , kelly and present works predict two si  viii lines ( see table 1 ) with intensities being agreement with the measurements [ see fig .",
    "however , kelly further shows a considerable contribution from si  x and si  vii at the peak of 61.256   , which results into the sum intensity is higher than the experiment value by @xmath060% . for peaks at 62.993 , 63.377 , 63.762 , and 64.482   ,",

    "whereas , the peak intensities at 65.977 and 67.418   are satisfactorily reproduced in the present work , yet kelly misses the contribution around 65.977   and overestimates the contribution around 67.418   and 72.389   by a factor up to @xmath01.0 .",
    "for the peaks at 68.294 , 69.734 , 70.129 , and 71.953   , the two calculations predict line intensities of si  vii being consistent with the measurements [ see fig .  4 ] .",
    "however , considerable contribution from si  viii ( 69.790   @xmath38@xmath39 ) is predicted in kelly database , which results into the sum intensity is greatly higher than the measured value . for the peaks at 73.136 , 73.394 and 75.160",

    "the observed line - width is @xmath00.30.4   over the wavelength range of 40180   , which is due to the broadening from entrance slit with width of 50  @xmath19 m . using well - known lines of highly charged carbon ,",

    "calculations at different electron densities , indicate that the spectra of the dense plasma are more complicate than the spectra from thin plasmas such as astrophysical , electron beam ion trap and tokamak plasmas .",
