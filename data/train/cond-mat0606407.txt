    "the interplay between charge quantization and superconductivity offers the possibility to study macroscopic quantum phenomena in small - capacitance josephson junction circuits .",
    "one of the most extensively studied devices in this context is the cooper pair transistor ( cpt ) , which consists of two josephson junctions in series , with a gate capacitively coupled to the small island formed between the two junctions .",
    "such single island circuits are fundamental building blocks for quantum electronic circuits based on the number - phase uncertainty of the cooper pair condensate , and have been the object of growing interest due to their potential to realize new types of quantum limited measurements and solid state quantum bits .",
    "essential for all these applications is the ability to inhibit the excitation of quasiparticles which give rise to dissipation ( noise ) , and thereby decoherence . for the cpt",
    "this means that the charge parity of the island must be well controlled , so that quasiparticles , or single unpaired electrons , are not transferred to or from the cpt island .",
    "here we study the cpt in a tunable high frequency electrodynamic environment , where the dc current - voltage characteristic ( ivc ) of the cpt exhibits a coulomb blockade of cooper pair tunneling . by tuning the impedance of the environment ,",
    "we demonstrate how the parity of the island is controlled by the environment .",
    "cpts have been most extensively studied in a high frequency environment with low impedance , @xmath3 , where the gate voltage modulates the critical current flowing through the device . at low temperature and in the absence of quasiparticle excitations ,",
    "this modulation should be periodic in gate voltage with period @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the gate capacitance .",
    "@xmath6-periodic modulation is a clear sign that charge transport through the device is due to cooper pairs , which do not change the parity of the island .",
    "however , in many experiments this parity effect is spoiled by the transfer of quasiparticles to or from the island , resulting in an @xmath2-periodic gate modulation , or modified @xmath6-periodic modulation , as the unpaired electron occupies the island .",
    "for applications like the coherent control of a quantum bit , these quasiparticles have to be avoided , and several experimental studies have been carried out in order to understand and control this parity effect .",
    "normal metal leads , or small normal metal  traps \" , contacting the superconducting source and drain close to the tunnel junctions are thought to help bring long - lifetime out - of - equilibrium quasiparticles into thermal equilibrium , and thereby enhance the parity effect  @xcite .",
    "however , in many experiments where no traps were used , a parity effect was demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the lifetime of the unpaired quasiparticle on the island could be dramatically reduced by fabricating the island of the cpt with a larger superconducting energy gap than that of the source - drain .    here",
    "we present an experimental study of the cpt in a high impedance environment , @xmath7 , where far less experimental work has been done due to the difficulty in constructing such an environment . in a high impedance environment ,",
    "the ivc of the cpt shows not a supercurrent , but rather a coulomb blockade of cooper pair tunneling .",
    "the coulomb blockade is modulated with the gate voltage and , in the absence of quasiparticles , this modulation is @xmath6-periodic .",
    "previously , the high impedance environment has been achieved with small on - chip resistors ( @xmath8 ) located close to the cpt , which have enabled the observation of a coulomb blockade of cooper pair tunneling with @xmath6-periodic dependence on the gate charge  @xcite .",
    "more recently , one - dimensional squid arrays have been used to bias a cpt  @xcite which is the technique used in the present study .",
    "the great advantage of the squid array bias is that the impedance of the environment can be tuned _ in situ _",
    ", without affecting the cpt .",
    "in this way the role of fluctuations due to the environment can be easily identified .    in this article",
    "we study the ivc of the cpt as the environment impedance is changed over many orders of magnitude . starting from a superconducting - like ivc at low impedance , a well defined coulomb blockade of cooper pair tunneling with a back - bending ivc develops as the impedance of the environment",
    "is increased .",
    "this back - bending ivc is due to the coherent tunneling of single cooper pairs and is a clear indication that @xmath7 .",
    "we show that the gate voltage dependence of the ivc changes from @xmath2-periodic to @xmath6-periodic as the environment impedance is increased .",
    "the high impedance environment suppresses quasiparticle tunneling rates , thereby restoring the even parity of the island .",
    "these observations indicate new approaches for controlling out - of - equilibrium quasiparticles in superconducting quantum circuits .",

    "four arrays , each consisting of 70 squids in series , connect the cpt to the bias and measurement circuitry . the squids are designed to have two identical junctions in order to suppress the josephson coupling in the array as low as possible .",
    "the nominal area of each junction in a squid is 0.03  @xmath10m@xmath11 , and the loop area is 0.18  @xmath10m@xmath11 .",
    "each cpt junction has a nominal area of 0.01 - 0.02  @xmath10m@xmath11 . to provide an effective high impedance environment",
    ", the arrays have to be located close to the cpt , so as to avoid the shunting capacitance of the leads .",
    "the squid arrays have high impedance due to the josephson inductance of the squid @xmath12 , which becomes infinite as the critical current of the squid , @xmath13 , is suppressed to zero with an external magnetic flux .",
    "this inductance is also non - linear , as it depends on the phase across the squid , and therefore a linear circuit model can not give a complete description of the electrodynamics of these arrays .",
    "however , for current much less than the critical current , a linear approximation can be made , which shows that the infinite array behaves like a transmission line with a gap , or region of frequency where no propagating modes exist .",
    "a finite array will have a set of discrete modes , and for arrays such as the ones used in this study , the lowest frequency mode has @xmath14  ghz  @xcite .",
    "the impedance of arrays such as these has not yet been systematically characterized due to the very high frequencies involved .",
    "however , we have shown that these arrays do provide an environment which induces a coulomb blockade of cooper pair tunneling and bloch oscillations in a single josephson junction  @xcite .",
    "as the magnetic flux through the squid loops is increased , the arrays undergo a quantum phase transition  @xcite where the measured zero bias resistance of the array increases several orders of magnitude ( 50  k@xmath15g@xmath1 ) .",
    "a key aspect of this type of experiments is that the arrays can be tuned in this transition region to a point where they provide a high enough impedance at high frequencies , while not having too large @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath16 becomes too large , the input offset current of the voltage amplifier will inhibit the measurement of the differential voltage across the cpt .",
    "the chip with the arrays and cpt is bonded to a printed circuit board with connectors , which is mounted in a rf - tight box on a dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of 15  mk .",
    "the cryostat leads are twisted constatan pairs , which act as rather good microwave filters attenuating 35  db / ghz up to 2  ghz , above which a background level of -80  db is measured with an open cryostat .",
    "additional room temperature rc filters were used to suppress lower frequency noise when necessary .",
    "no microwave filters between the sample and twisted pairs were implemented in these measurements . however , in the high impedance case , the arrays themselves are good filters , protecting the cpt from electromagnetic fluctuations coming from the bias side of the arrays .",

    "the value of these rates can not be inferred from the stability analysis alone  @xcite . for @xmath131",
    "the effective island charge will most often be even , hence the measured voltage of the cpt will be minimal near @xmath121 ( see fig .",
    "the effects of poisoning will not be noticed on the long time scale of the experiment and one observes a stable 2@xmath2-periodic modulation of transport . in the opposite case @xmath132 near @xmath121 ,",
    "the decay of the odd state is much slower than that of the even state .",
    "the effective island charge will be predominantly odd and the measured average voltage , instead of taking a minimum value , will reach a local maximum , that eventually may become equal to the maxima found at @xmath133 ( see fig .",

    "this is in agreement with several other experiments on cpts with @xmath124 in low impedance environments  @xcite .",
    "we also note that the observed @xmath2-periodicity excludes that @xmath114 is large compared @xmath135 .",
    "if @xmath136 , we would have found overlapping regions of stable even parity near @xmath121 , rather than regions of fluctuating parity and the resulting dependence of critical voltage on gate voltage would have been @xmath6-periodic in the low impedance case .",
    "we finally comment on the effect of finite temperature .",
    "the energy difference @xmath114 depends on temperature @xmath110 . for the islands used in this experiment , the characteristic crossover temperature @xmath137 where @xmath138 can be estimated to be approximately 250  mk .",
    "the temperature @xmath110 appearing in the expression for @xmath114 does not necessarily correspond to the cryostat temperature , and could be an effective temperature , describing the fluctuations in the environment .",
    "previous analysis of single junctions ivcs biased by similar arrays  @xcite showed an effective noise temperature approximately 150  mk , which would result in @xmath139 in agreement with our conclusions above .",
    "a second effect of thermal fluctuations is that they mix states of different parity whose energy difference is @xmath140 . on the level of the stability diagrams",
    "this means that the lines separating stability regions of different parity smear into strips whose width is @xmath141 .",
    "for the low impedance case this has drastic effects , even at low bias , because it leads to broadening of the parity fluctuation regions near @xmath121 thereby enhancing the @xmath2-periodic gate modulation .",
    "for high impedance the even parity stability region has a gap with respect to the bias voltage , therefore thermal fluctuations do not effect the @xmath6-periodicity as long as @xmath142 .",
    "the fact that parity stability is robust against fluctuations for small bias voltage in a high impedance environment is directly connected with the inelastic nature of tunneling in this limit .",
    "this inelasticity is at the origin of the bias voltage gap and leads to an exponential suppression of quasiparticle tunneling at low bias voltage .",
