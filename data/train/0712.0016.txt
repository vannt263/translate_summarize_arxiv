    "the two major new particles expected at colliders are dark matter and the higgs boson .",
    "while some models are now ruled out at energies accessible to bottom and charm factories , it is by no means proven that these _ can not _ be light .",
    "in fact there exist many attractive models containing light higgses , for instance supersymmetric models which solve the @xmath1 problem via an extended higgs sector.@xcite furthermore the problem of light dark matter and light higgses are related , as light dark matter particle @xmath2 , in its simplest incarnation , requires a new light particle @xmath3 with @xmath4 to serve as an @xmath5-channel annihilation mediator . a promising possibility for @xmath3",
    "is that it is a pseudo - scalar higgs , which can be naturally light due to new symmetries which can protect its small mass.@xcite in order to ensure discovery , we should look everywhere that is practical for solutions to these problems , and @xmath6- and @xmath7-factories can perform an important set of new - particle searches .    apart from the dark matter question , in the mssm it was rigorously shown that an extremely light neutralino is experimentally unconstrained if one drops the assumption of gaugino unification , and the requirement that the neutralino relic density be equal to the dark matter relic density.@xcite for instance , the dark matter problem could be solved in another manner , such as with the qcd axion , rendering the neutralino an insignificant contributor to the relic density of the universe .",
    "in dark matter searches , the error on the mass of dark matter is @xmath8 gev at the lhc in the best studies using optimistic models with large cross sections .",
    "gev for the dark matter mass . as this mass is brought closer to zero , the resolution on it at the lhc worsens . ]",
    "ultimately this is due to the resolution of the hadronic calorimeter , since to determine the mass scale , a missing energy event at the lhc can either use the missing transverse momentum , which is a hadronic observable@xcite or if purely leptonic observables exist , one can use the changes in slopes and shapes as a function of overall mass scale , which are only weakly correlated.@xcite    the only truly fundamental limit on the mass of dark matter comes from the cosmic microwave background , which tells us the fraction of the universe that was non - relativistic at the time that photons decoupled , a measurement which includes dark matter .",
    "dark matter must have been non - relativistic at a temperature of about @xmath9 ev , therefore the smallest possible mass consistent with the standard cosmological model is about 0.3 ev .",
    "this means that bottom and charm factories are capable of exploring 10 orders of magnitude in the dark matter mass .",
    "the lhc can expand to the range 5 gev ",
    "1 tev , but has no precision below approximately 4 gev .",
    "we feel that the most compelling motivation for dark matter searches at bottom and charm factories is the demonstrable wisdom of a model independent approach .",
    "indeed , the reason @xmath10 gev was ignored for so long is due to heavy reliance on models . in particular the minimal supersymmetric standard model can not support dark matter this light because it would require another charged or colored particle to be lighter than other limits .",
    "the secondary particle is necessary to get the annihilation cross section large enough .",
    "nearly all models which can not support light dark matter can not do so because of limits on _",
    "particles other than the dark matter candidate itself_. trivial extensions of these models can generically support light dark matter by adding a mediator which is mostly singlet under the standard model .",
    "several models demonstrate this explicitly.@xcite        the most minimal model possible for dark matter is to add only the dark matter candidate @xmath2",
    "itself.@xcite however these models generate very heavy dark matter candidates , outside the reach of @xmath6- and @xmath7- factories .    the second most minimal models adds the mediator @xmath3 as well , which is flavor neutral and couples both to the standard model and dark matter .",
    "these are the models testable at @xmath6- and @xmath7- factories .",
    "@xmath3 can be a new gauge boson as proposed in refs.@xcite , or a scalar as proposed in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath3 is a vector , it is necessarily anomalous , so building a consistent model requires even more matter than the @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "we are not aware of any such model in the literature .",
    "this is not because it is impossible , but rather because the resulting models are ugly , requiring several symmetry breaking scales and associated higgses , as well as extra matter to cancel anomalies . if @xmath3 is a scalar , it can only couple to standard model fermions by mixing with the higgs bosons due to gauge invariance , making its couplings proportional to mass . in the author",
    "s opinion , a scalar or pseudo - scalar is a more natural candidate for @xmath3 . though as we will see in the next section , a vector @xmath3 may be easier to discover .    treating the relic density as a constraint",
    ", acceptable models are achieved for ( at least ) two values of the dark matter mass as a function of the mediator s mass , @xmath11 , as can be seen in fig.[omegah2mx ] this is because the process controlling the annihilation of dark matter in the early universe is an @xmath5-channel annihilation diagram , rather than t - channel diagrams . in order for a t - channel diagram to dominate the annihilation ,",
    "the new particle in the t - channel must be charged or colored .",
    "gev , annihilation to neutral higgses or z - bosons is kinematically disallowed .",
    "] this occurs in the mssm ( e.g. `` stau co - annihilation '' ) and generates one of the most promising regions of parameter space .",
    "there is experimental evidence that dark matter may be light from the integral satellite@xcite , which has detected an anomalously large population of positrons in the galactic center , as suggested in ref.@xcite . if this is from dark matter annihilation , it requires @xmath12 mev.@xcite    another source of evidence is from the dama annual modulation signal . as shown in ref.@xcite ,",
    "this is consistent with light dark matter due to the lower threshold of sodium , as compared to heavier elements such as gallium ( cdms ) and xenon ( xenon ) .",
    "there are two major modes of discovery for light dark matter : invisible meson decay@xcite and radiative decay@xcite .",
    "these are described respectively in the following subsections .          in invisible meson decay",
    ", one can make a _ nave _ calculation of the branching ratio for a meson .",
    "one can get an order of magnitude estimate for the annihilation cross section using @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the relic density for species @xmath15 relative to the critical density @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the hubble constant , and @xmath18 is the thermally averaged annihilation cross section of the dm into standard model particles . using the central value of the wmap  @xcite result for @xmath19 , we can invert this equation and solve for the required annihilation cross section for light relics @xmath20 the velocity @xmath21 appearing here is the mller velocity , which we approximate by the relative velocity in the center - of - mass frame , @xmath22 , using @xmath23 .",
    "the approximate temperature at freeze - out is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mass of the dm and @xmath26 is an expansion parameter evaluated at the freeze - out temperature that is @xmath27 depending on the model . by approximating that @xmath28",
    "we can remove the kinematic velocity factor , assuming that the per - particle energy is given by the average energy of the gas @xmath29 .",
    "we can expand @xmath30 in the velocity at freeze - out to separate @xmath5-wave and @xmath31-wave components , @xmath32 . since the dark matter annihilates through the u - boson and",
    "not the meson we re interested in , the freeze - out may in general occur at a different energy than the invisibly - decaying meson mass .",
    "therefore we also remove the extra @xmath33 term and solve for @xmath6 in the @xmath31-wave case .",
    "these manipulations remove the kinematic factors of the initial state , giving us a cross section that essentially assumes the dark matter is massless with respect to our invisibly - decaying meson ; that the meson mass is much larger than the center - of - mass energy at freeze - out .    for these assumptions with @xmath34 at freeze - out",
    "we have : @xmath35    the invisible branching ratio of a hadron can then be estimated by assuming that the time - reversed reaction is the same , @xmath36 .",
    "since the meson decays by the meson mixing with the @xmath3 boson , @xmath31-wave suppression factors are not reintroduced for the reverse reaction .",
    "we assume that the dm mediator is not flavor changing and that annihilation occurs in the @xmath5 channel .",
    "therefore , the best - motivated hadrons to have an invisible width are same - flavor quark - antiquark bound states ( quarkonia ) with narrow widths .",
    "the invisible width of a hadron composed dominantly of @xmath37 is given approximately by : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the hadronic form factor ( wave function at the origin ) for the state @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the hadron s mass . here",
    "we ignore final state kinematic and spin factors .",
    "we can predict an approximate expectation for the branching ratios for narrow states . some of the most promising are shown in table [ brs ] :",
    ".estimated branching ratios for the narrowest mesons .",
    "the two columns correspond to the assumption that the dark matter annihilation in the early universe occurs in either the @xmath5-wave or @xmath31-wave .",
    "neutrino branching ratios are from ref.@xcite .",
    "all mesons have a branching ratio ( even if tiny ) to neutrinos . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     branching ratios for scalars and pseudo - scalars tend to be smaller since those states are wider .",
    "we emphasize again that this is only an order - of - magnitude calculation .",
    "a more precise calculation requires inclusion of kinematic and spin factors , as well as consideration of which fermions the mediator @xmath3 couples to .",
    "furthermore , the freeze - out of light dark matter occurs in the middle of the qcd phase transition , and is much more sensitive to uncertainties due to qcd than heavier dark matter .",
    "this kind of dark matter is also annihilating through a narrow pole , which must be treated carefully.@xcite narrow poles arise due to the @xmath3 boson itself , as well as numerous qcd resonances .",

    "we show the branching ratio of @xmath66 and @xmath42 into @xmath67 in the nmssm.@xcite the relevance of these plots for dark matter are that the @xmath43 may decay into the neutralino if the bino mass @xmath68 is decreased to make this mode kinematically allowed ( without affecting this branching ratio ) .",
    "this can be done such that it is compatible with all collider constraints including @xmath69 as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "these branching ratios have little to do with the model assumptions of the nmssm and can be parameterized only with @xmath70 and @xmath71 : @xmath72 so that experimentally , the only thing one needs worry about is that @xmath73 is small enough that the mode is kinematically allowed , and any limit can be interpreted in the @xmath74 vs. @xmath73 plane .",
    "this covers a vast array of model space including any model with a light higgs having some singlet admixture .",
    "such higgses appear in refs.@xcite",
    "likewise , the existence of light higgses can completely destroy the observability of standard model higgs signals at the lhc via decays such as @xmath75 if it is dominant , where @xmath76 is a sm - like higgs and @xmath77 is a lighter , mostly - singlet higgs .",
    "even if substantial backgrounds at the lhc can be overcome , the lhc will be unable to get a precise measurement of the lighter @xmath77 mass .",
    "if @xmath77 decays to @xmath78 the missing energy makes the mass measurement imprecise .",
    "if the @xmath77 decays to charm , strange , or gluons this renders the dominant higgs decay entirely hadronic , and likely unobservable at the lhc due to hadronic backgrounds .",
    "by contrast , bottom and charm factories can obtain precise measurements of the mass via the energy of a recoiling photon in the process @xmath79.@xcite the @xmath77 may have branching fractions to both standard model matter and dark matter .",
    "the mode @xmath80 was first suggested by wilczek.@xcite this mode is subject to significant radiative and threshold corrections , a comprehensive list of which can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was vigorously pursued until about 1995 , when it became clear that the lep accelerator , searching for sm or mssm higgses in the higgsstrahlung modes @xmath81 and @xmath82 was superior .",
    "the best measurements on the upsilon were made by cleo,@xcite however these remain about a factor of 10 away from being sensitive to a standard model higgs .",
    "existing data can reach the sensitivity required , as cleo and belle have approximately 20 times more data collected than that used in these limits .",
    "it will be necessary to reach and exceed the standard model limits to have sensitivity to higgses with some singlet admixture .",
    "the lep measurements told us that no new particles with masses below @xmath53 have a significant coupling to the @xmath83 .",
    "however , they tell us little about particles which have small coupling to the @xmath83 , and can not rule out the existence of light particles .",
    "particles with small @xmath83 coupling are still allowed and can have interesting couplings to higgses and fermions .",
    "it is perhaps surprising that a light higgs could still exist at low energies , and be compatible with all existing direct and indirect limits .",
    "however numerous studies have borne this out in a variety of models .",
    "all relevant experimental limits have been checked and light higgses remain consistent with them .",
    "some examples are : in the context of the two higgs doublet model , @xmath84 ( the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ) was examined@xcite , as well as br@xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , br@xmath88 , br@xmath89@xcite . in the context of the nmssm ,",
    "br@xmath90@xcite was examined and found to be compatible .",
    "we should note also that there is experimental evidence that this decay exists , from considerations of the excess seen at lep near @xmath91 gev , fine tuning in the nmssm,@xcite , as well as some anomalous events at the hypercp experiment which seem to indicate a @xmath92 mev pseudo - scalar decaying to muons@xcite that can be verified using radiative decays .    to allow a higgs to be light",
    ", one must reduce its coupling to the @xmath83 boson . in the mssm this is proportional to @xmath93 for the cp - even state , and zero ( at tree level ) for the cp - odd state .",
    "thus , by tuning the higgs mixing angle @xmath94 to be close to the ratio of the vacuum expectation values @xmath95 , this can be achieved . in the mssm ,",
    "however , the relationships among masses , @xmath94 , and @xmath71 is too constrained to allow only one of the higgses to be lighter than @xmath53 while simultaneously satisfying the higgsstrahlung constraints . basically , one of the cp - even higgses has a mass related to the cp - odd higgs , and the other is related to @xmath53 .",
    "so one can not bring the @xmath17 light while simultaneously keeping the @xmath47 heavy .",
    "the @xmath47 becomes light as well , and generates a large cross section for @xmath96 .",
    "this difficulty comes from the fact that there is not enough freedom in the higgs mass matrices , and as such is a theoretical constraint caused by one s assumptions , and not experimental proof that there is no light higgs . in models with more higgs particles or more freedom in the higgs self - couplings ,",
    "the @xmath97 coupling is more complex , and can be made small .",
    "the expansion of the higgs sector in this manner is well motivated from the need to break any extra gauge symmetries such as a @xmath98@xcite or @xmath99 , or to solve the mssm s",
    "@xmath1 problem.@xcite such particles may also generically be associated with susy breaking .    in a more general two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , small coupling to the @xmath83 can be achieved with light higgses because @xmath71 and @xmath94 are essentially free parameters .",
    "there remains some interesting parameter space in the 2hdm accessible at @xmath6- and @xmath7- factories , but it is small.@xcite    finally there now exists `` gauge - phobic higgs '' models in which electroweak symmetry breaking occurs by a combination of an elementary higgs and breaking by by boundary conditions in an extra dimension.@xcite in such models , the higgses become decoupled from the @xmath83 .",
    "their mass again becomes a free parameter and can be light , depending on how much of the symmetry breaking occurs due to the higgs and how much due to the extra dimension .",
    "as the @xmath6-factories come to the end of their lives , much attention has been given to possible runs off the @xmath100 resonance .",
    "this is an extremely promising idea .",
    "a small amount ( e.g. weeks to months ) of run time at a different energy may provide powerful physics results .",
    "spending that same time on the @xmath100 will provide only a negligible improvement over the already precise flavor physics results returned by these machines .",
    "the promising options for future runs are on the @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath66 .",
    "we have argued for the @xmath101 due to the existence of the radiative decay @xmath104 , has this decay mode also , as used in the invisible @xmath42 search by cleo@xcite , however the pions are softer and more difficult to reconstruct . ] which can be used as a powerful constraint to remove backgrounds for invisible searches@xcite and higgs searches@xcite .",
    "in addition to the cleo data collected in the 1990 s , belle has already collected 2.9 fb@xmath105@xcite on the @xmath101 .",
    "no new studies have yet been published on the radiative decays @xmath106 or @xmath107 . to improve on the capabilities of the cleo datasets",
    "when searching for rare decays , it is necessary to further reject backgrounds .",
    "the single photon signal itself ( ignoring the rest of the event ) has sizeable backgrounds from direct production of 3-body final states @xmath108 which is a background to @xmath109 .",
    "this argument was presented for @xmath110 in ref.@xcite , but holds just as well for other fermions . due to the high luminosity ,",
    "babar and belle have higher photon backgrounds in general than cleo did .",
