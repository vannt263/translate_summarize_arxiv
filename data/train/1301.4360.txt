    "bandwidth - sharing policies as introduced by massouli & roberts  @xcite dynamically distribute network resources among a changing population of users .",
    "processor sharing is an example of such a  policy and assumes a single resource .",
    "bandwidth - sharing networks are of great research and practical interest . along with the basic application in telecommunications media , e.g. internet congestion control",
    ", they also have recently been suggested as a tool in analyzing problems in road traffic  @xcite .",
    "the main issues in bandwidth - sharing related research are stability conditions and performance evaluation .",
    "a variety of results regarding the first topic may be found in de veciana _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , bonald & massouli @xcite , mo & walrand @xcite , massouli @xcite , bramson @xcite , gromoll & williams @xcite , and chiang _",
    "_ @xcite . as for the second topic , for special combinations of network topologies and bandwidth - sharing policies ,",
    "the network stationary distribution may be shown to be of a product form insensitive to the flow size distribution , see bonald _ et al .",
    "however , in general , approximation methods must be used , which is the subject matter of the present paper .",
    "fundamental papers on fluid limit approximations for bandwidth sharing - networks are kelly & williams @xcite and gromoll & williams @xcite , some more results on fluid and diffusion approximations are to be found in borst _",
    "@xcite , kang _",
    "_ @xcite and ye & yao @xcite . the latter works ignore the fact that generally in practice the maximum service rate of an individual user is constrained , as has been pointed out by roberts @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "ayesta & mandjes @xcite were the first to deal with fluid and diffusion approximations of bandwidth - sharing networks with rate limitations .",
    "they consider two specific settings first without rate constraints , and then they truncate the capacity constraints at the rate maxima . reed & zwart @xcite develop a different approach in the context of general bandwidth - sharing networks .",
    "they incorporate the rate constraints into the network utility maximization procedure that defines bandwidth allocations .",
    "thus , users operating below the maximal rate are allowed to take up the bandwidth that is not used by other rate constrained users , and bandwidth allocations are pareto optimal .",
    "another interesting feature of this work is the scaling regime .",
    "in contrast to the papers mentioned above , which mostly focus on the large - time properties of networks with fixed - order parameters , reed & zwart view networks on a fixed - time scale letting arrival rates and capacities grow large .",
    "this large capacity scaling reflects the fact that overall network capacity and individual user rate constraints may be of different orders of magnitude .",
    "for example , it is common that internet providers set download speed limitations for individual users which are typically measured in megabits per second , while network capacities are measured in gigabits or terabits per second .",
    "the framework of @xcite is rather comprehensive . in particular",
    ", it allows abandonments of flows : each flow knows how long it can stay in the system and abandons as soon as its service is finished or its patience time expires , whichever happens earlier .",
    "the present paper builds upon @xcite by relaxing its stochastic assumptions : we assume general distribution for interarrival times and general joint distribution for the size and patience time of a flow ( in particular , the flow size and patience time are allowed to be dependent ) , while @xcite assumes a markovian setting with independent arrivals , flow sizes and patience times .",
    "we study the behavior of bandwidth - sharing networks in terms of measure - valued processes that are called state descriptors and that keep track of residual flow sizes and residual patience times .",
    "the first main result of the paper is a fluid limit theorem ( it generalizes the fluid limit result of  @xcite to non - markovian stochastic assumptions ) .",
    "we propose a  fluid model , or a formal deterministic approximation of the stochastic bandwidth - sharing model , and show that the scaled state descriptors are tight with all weak limit points a.s . solving the fluid model equation .",
    "we provide a sufficient condition for the fluid model to have a unique solution , which converts tightness of the scaled state descriptors into convergence to this fluid model solution . in the sense of techniques used in the proofs ,",
    "this part of the paper is closely related to previous work on bandwidth - sharing @xcite , processor - sharing with impatience @xcite , and bandwidth - sharing in overload @xcite .",
    "the rate constraints play a crucial role in adopting these techniques .",
    "for example , the proof of convergence to fluid model solutions in @xcite requires an additional assumption of overload to eliminate problems at zero .",
    "however , in our case , due to the rate constraints , the network never empties , and the load conditions become irrelevant .    our second main result , which is a new type of result for bandwidth - sharing networks , is convergence of the scaled network stationary distribution to the fixed point of the fluid model , provided the fixed point is unique .",
    "there is a similar result by kang & ramanan @xcite for a call center model , but the techniques of  @xcite are different than ours . applying the approach of borst _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , we prove that in many cases the fixed point can be found by solving an optimization problem with a strictly concave objective function and a polyhedral constraint set , and thus is unique and computable in polynomial time .",
    "we also construct an example with multiple fixed points , which is a feature that is distinctive from earlier cited works . besides proving new results for the particular model of bandwidth - sharing",
    ", we also suggest new ideas and believe that they can be adjusted to other models , too .",
    "in particular , we derive equations for asymptotic bounds for fluid model solutions ( see  theorem  [ th : stable_fixed_point ] ) that can be solved for a wide class of networks , and then asymptotic stability of the fixed point can be shown .",
    "another interesting idea is that , in the stationary regime , the properties of a network depend on newly arriving flows only , since all initial flows are gone after some point ( see  lemma  [ lem : stat_no_atoms ] ) . throughout this part of the paper ,",
    "we assume poisson arrivals , since that guarantees existence of a unique stationary distribution .",
    "poisson arrivals also imply @xmath0 bounds that are exploited heavily in the proofs .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : stochastic_model ] describes the stochastic bandwidth - sharing model , and section  [ sec : fluid_model ] introduces its deterministic analogue , the fluid model .",
    "also section  [ sec : fluid_model ] states sufficient conditions for a fluid model solution to be unique , and for a fixed fluid model solution to be unique and asymptotically stable .",
