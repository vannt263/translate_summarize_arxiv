    "it is long known that strong convective storms , such as supercell thunderstorms are powerful sources of infrasound @xcite .",
    "detailed observations of convective storm generated infrasound @xcite provides that at least two different group of infrasonic signals could be identified .",
    "the first group , with characteristic period about @xmath0 s , has been found to be in strong connection with proto - tornadic structures , funnel clouds and tornadoes .",
    "based on coincident radar measurements of tornados , which show strong relationship between funnel diameter and infrasound frequency , it is usually supposed that these infrasound waves are generated by radial vibrations of the funnel core @xcite .",
    "the second group of infrasound signals has the periods from @xmath1 to @xmath2 s. usually the emission appears about 1 hour before observation of tornado .",
    "these waves are not related with tornado itself and are caused by convective processes that precedes tornado formation .",
    "the acoustic power radiated by convective storm system could be as high as @xmath3 watts @xcite .",
    "although several reasonable mechanisms have been suggested to explain this acoustic radiation , the physical mechanism of the process remains unexplained @xcite .",
    "broad and smooth spectrum of the observed infrasound radiation indicates that turbulence is one of the promising sources of the radiation .",
    "lighthill s acoustic analogy @xcite represents the basis for understanding of the generation of sound by turbulent flows . in this approach",
    "the flow is assumed to be known and the sound field is calculated as a small by - product of the flow . according to this theory in the case of uniform background thermodynamic parameters interaction of turbulent vortices provides quadrupole source of sound .",
    "the acoustic power of the source was estimated by proudman @xcite . but",
    "usage of this estimation for the infrasound radiation from convective storms usually leads to the underestimation of the acoustic power @xcite .",
    "it is also well known that any kind of inhomogeneity of the background flow , such as stratification , shear of the background velocity profile and temperature fluctuations leads to appearance of additional ( mainly dipole ) sources of sound @xcite .",
    "resent developments in this direction led to the formulation of the generalized acoustic analogy @xcite that implies : ( i ) dividing the the flow variables into their mean and fluctuating parts ; ( ii ) substracting out the equation for the mean flow ; ( iii ) collecting all the linear terms on one side of equations and the nonlinear terms on the other side ; ( iv ) treating the latter terms as as known source of sound .    in the presented paper we consider acoustic radiation from turbulent convection taking into account mentioned above effects of stratification , inhomogeneity of velocity profile and temperature fluctuations .",
    "performed analysis shows that for the typical parameters of supercell storms the dipole radiation related to temperature inhomogeneities is at least of the same order as radiation of lighthill s quadrupole source .",
    "it is also shown that the source related to stratification could have valuable contribution whereas some other sources are shown to be very inefficient .",

    "existence of the latest one is known to be necessary for the formation of the strongest convective storm systems , supercell storms @xcite . however , as it will be shown below none of these flows can have valuable direct influence on the infrasound generation .",
    "next step of the study in the framework of mentioned above generalized acoustic analogy is derivation of the linear equation for acoustic wave propagation .",
    "taking into account eq .",
    "( [ eq:216 ] ) linearized continuity , euler and state equations can be written as @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are perturbations of velocity , density and pressure respectively ; @xmath43 is convective derivative ; and @xmath44 .    combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq:31])-([eq:35 ] ) for perturbation of total enthalpy @xmath45 we obtain following equation @xmath46 where @xmath47 is so - called third order linear wave operator @xmath48 and @xmath49 is sound velocity and @xmath50 .",
    "operators similar to @xmath47 are well known in jet noise theory @xcite .",
    "obtained linear equation describes not only the acoustic wave propagation but it also describes the instability wave solutions that are usually associated with large scale turbulent structures and continuous spectrum solutions that are related to `` fine - grained '' turbulent motions @xcite . in the presence of any kind of inhomogeneity ( in the case under consideration all the background variables depend on vertical coordinate @xmath11 ) linear coupling between these perturbations is possible , and in principle acoustic waves can be generated by both instability waves and continuous spectrum perturbations .",
    "but in the case of low mach number ( @xmath51 ) flows both kind of perturbations are very inefficient sources of sound . the acoustic power is proportional to @xmath52 and @xmath53 for instability waves and continuous spectrum perturbations respectively @xcite . in the last expression @xmath54",
    "is the ratio of length scales of energy containing vortices and background velocity inhomogeneity ( @xmath55 ) . in the case of supercell thunderstorm @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    ", therefore both linear mechanisms have negligible acoustic output and attention should be payed to sources of sound related to nonlinear terms and entropy fluctuations that will be studied in the next section .",
    "propagation of infrasound in the atmosphere was intensively studied by different authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) and will not be considered in this paper .",
    "for obtaining the sources of acoustic waves generated by turbulent convection we follow standard technique of acoustic analogy . dividing the flow variables into their mean and fluctuating parts keeping the nonlinear terms in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:31])-([eq:34 ] ) , and noting that in general in the flow there can exist entropy fluctuations , so replacing eq .",

    "( [ eq:42 ] ) all the nonlinear terms containing @xmath65 has been omitted , due to the fact that these terms are known to be much weaker sources of sound then the terms containing @xmath66 in the low mach number flows @xcite .",
    "all the sources presented in eq .",
    "( [ eq:42 ] ) are well known in aeroacoustics . consequently , we do not repeat calculations of acoustic power ( i.e. , acoustic energy generated in a unit time ) of each source term and adopt well known results @xcite for the problem under consideration . the main idea of mentioned methods of acoustic power calculations",
    "is the following : in the low mach number flows convective propagation effects have minor influence on sound generation process and therefore all the terms containing @xmath67 on the left hand side of eq . ( [ eq:42 ] ) can be neglected .",
    "this circumstance allows one to obtain simple estimations of acoustic power of the sources .    in the absence of background flow ( @xmath68 ) the first term @xmath69 reduces to the lighthill s quadrupole source @xcite .",

    "@xcite to estimate acoustic power of supercell storm .",

    "m / s , @xmath77 m and @xmath78 , we obtain @xmath79 , i.e. , the power of this source is weaker then acoustic power of lighthill s quadrupole source , but in principle considered dipole source could have valuable contribution to the total acoustic power .",
    "the source term @xmath80 is related to inhomogeneity of updraft velocity .",
    "it is dipole source similar to @xmath73 .",
    "corresponding acoustic power @xmath81 is negligibly small in comparison with @xmath82 for low mach number flows ( for supercell storms @xmath83 ) .",
    "the last term @xmath84 is caused by entropy fluctuations .",
    "the most strong acoustic source of this kind is so - called thermo acoustical source @xcite that is related to small scale inhomogeneities of background density ( and therefore temperature ) fluctuations , that produce dipole source .",
    "the physics of this kind of acoustic radiation is the following : `` hot spots '' or `` entropy inhomogeneities '' behave as scattering centers at which dynamic pressure fluctuations are converted directly into sound .",
    "the acoustic power @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the rms of temperature fluctuations .",
    "taking for supercell storm @xcite @xmath87 m / s ; @xmath88k and @xmath89 k we see that for the typical parameters of supercell storm the dipole radiation related to temperature inhomogeneities is at least of the same order as radiation of lighthill s quadrupole source .    in the considered model no attention",
    "was payed to the horizontal wind with vertical shear and rotation of the updraft flow .",
    "these assumptions allow us to obtain relatively simple equations .",
    "these flows could not make valuable changes in the acoustic output estimations .",
    "indeed , consideration of the wind and rotation can lead to appearance in the right hand side of eq .",

    "we study dry atmosphere and therefore influence of humidity on the sound generation in the convective storms has not been considered .",
    "we intend to study this influence in the future .",
