    "breaking detailed balance due to the presence of unbalanced forces acting on a system causes rectification of thermal fluctuations and leads to new dynamical behaviors , very different from those observed in equilibrium situations  @xcite .",
    "typical realizations of rectified motion include the transport of particles under the action of unbiased forces of optical  @xcite , mechanical  @xcite , or chemical  @xcite origin .",
    "hence , the implications of rectification has attracted the interest of researchers in a variety of fields , ranging from biology to nanoscience , due to its relevance in the transport and motion at small scales  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the behavior of such small engines , referred to as brownian ratchets , have been deeply studied and several models that capture some of their main features have been proposed  @xcite .    given the small size of rectifying elements , it is likely that their motion takes place close to boundaries or in confined environments .",
    "nevertheless , ratchet models usually assume that rectification develops in an unbound medium .",
    "since rectification develops as an interplay associated to how a particle experiences local forces while it explores the space around it , confinement plays an important role because it significantly reduces the number of allowed states of the rectifying elements .",
    "this restriction can be understood as an effective change of the entropy of the brownian ratchet as it displaces along the confined environment  @xcite .",
    "the relevance of entropic barriers to promote entropic transport  @xcite in confined environments has been recognized in a variety of situations that include molecular transport in zeolites  @xcite , ionic channels  @xcite , or in microfluidic devices  @xcite , where their shape explains , for example , the magnitude of the rectifying electric signal observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "in fact , spatially varying geometric constraints provide themselves an alternative means to rectify thermal fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "modulations in the available explored region lead to gradients in the system effective free energy , by inducing a local bias in its diffusion that can promote a macroscopic net velocity for aperiodic channel profiles  @xcite or due to applied alternating fields  @xcite    we will analyze the interplay between rectification and confinement , and will characterize the new features associated to confined brownian ratchets ( cbr ) .",
    "we show that the presence of strong cooperative rectification  @xcite between both may lead to rectification even when none of them can rectify the particle current on their own .",
    "such an interplay strongly affects particle motion . to understand the mutual influence between both rectifying sources",
    ", we will analyze three different ratchet models , namely the flashing ratchet , the two - level ratchet and a thermal ratchet . in the first two cases ,",
    "the equilibrium is broken by the energy injected in the system through the intrinsic ratchet mechanism as it happens in the case of molecular motors . in the third one ,",

    "the conformational changes of the molecular motors introduce an additional scale that will compete with rectification and geometrical confinement .",
    "infinitely - processive molecular motors remain always attached to the filament along which they displace and are affected by the geometrical restrictions only while displacing along the filament ; accordingly , we choose channel - independent binding rates @xmath83 . on the contrary ,",
    "highly non - processive molecular motors detach frequently from the biofilament and diffuse away ; an effect we account for considering a channel - driven binding rate , @xmath84 .",

    "since molecular motors can jump between two internal states , the corresponding expression for the overall free energy drop , @xmath46 , must be generalized to account for these internal changes .",
    "accordingly , the overall free energy drop must be identified from a two dimensional particle flux , a treatment that we leave for a future study .",

    "therefore , rectification in a periodic thermal ratchet , quantified by @xmath98 , can only develop from an interplay between the enthalpic and temperature variations  @xcite .",
    "although both the flashing and the thermal ratchet are characterized by a multiplicative noise , their different physical origin is at the basis of this different response . for the thermal ratchet the spatial inhomogeneity affects both the amplitude of the fluctuations and the local equilibrium distribution while for the flashing ratchet the noise amplitude is regarded as an effective coarse - graining of a molecular mechanism that is decoupled from the underlying equilibrium properties of the brownian particle .",

    "in this paper we have analyzed the motion of brownian ratchets in confined media .",
    "we have shown that the interplay between the intrinsic ratchet motion and the geometrically - induced rectification gives rise to a variety of dynamical behaviors not observed in the absence of the geometrical confinement .",
    "a novel effect , named cooperative rectification , arises as the net result of the overlap between the dynamic induced by the ratchet and the confinement and it is responsible for the onset of net currents even when neither the ratchet nor the geometrical constraint can rectify per se .",
    "the dynamics of the particles can be analyzed by means of the fick - jacobs equation .",
    "such an approach has allowed to identify two parameters , namely the entropic barrier @xmath76 an the free energy drop @xmath46 , that govern the overall dynamics of cbrs .",
    "on one hand , @xmath46 controls the onset of the cooperative rectification when @xmath175 .",
    "then , cooperative rectification leads to a net current whose sign is determined by @xmath46 . on the other hand , @xmath76 accounts for the relevance of confinement in the overall dynamics when @xmath176 .",
    "we have discussed when entropic confinement affects the rectification of a brownian ratchet by contrasting physically different ratchet mechanisms .",
    "in particular , in the analysis of brownian rectification induced by an inhomogeneous temperature profile we have clarified the relevance of the underlying mechanism breaking detailed balance . for a flashing ratchet the second moment of the longitudinal velocity of a cbr differs from the second moment associated to its transverse velocity while such an intrinsic anisotropy is lacking for the thermal ratchet . as a result ,",
    "confined thermal ratchets can rectify only if there is an interplay between the asymmetric enthalpic potential and temperature gradients .",
    "comparing the cases of a flashing ratchet and a two - state model of a molecular motor we conclude that the novel mechanism we describe is qualitatively robust with respect to the details of the brownian ratchet .",
    "however , the specificity of the rectification can affect both the quantitative response of a brownian ratchet to confinement and , in some cases , even affect the qualitative behavior observed ; e.g. velocity inversion can be observed increasing @xmath76 for processive molecular motors in a symmetric channel while velocity inversion is never observed for non - processive motors .",
    "the fick - jacobs approach has provided insight to understand these qualitative differences .",
    "we have always assumed that the confining channel and the ratchet potential have the same period . if both components have different periodicities , or if one of them show irregularities ( that can emerge , for example , from experimental defects in the channel build up ) , one can still account for the mismatch between the ratchet potential and the channel corrugation by considering that the phase shift @xmath64 , rather than having a well defined value , is characterized by a uniform distribution .",
    "the results reported show that , in this situation a net current persists except for the fully symmetric geometry .",
    "for asymmetric , intrinsically rectifying ratchets , we have seen that cbrs are very sensitive to corrugation and that the geometrical constraints strongly affect their motion . controlling the corrugation of the channel",
    "one can enhance significantly the net brownian ratchet velocity or can induce velocity inversion for all the brownian ratchet models considered . therefore , confinement provides a means to control particle motion at small scales .",
    "since particles with different sizes show a differential sensitivity to the geometrical constraints , it is possible to use channel corrugation to segregate brownian ratchets of different sizes , or even trap particles .",
    "therefore , cbrs offer new venues to particle control at small scales .",
