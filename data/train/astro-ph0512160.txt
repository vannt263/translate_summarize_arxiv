    "the large - scale velocity field provides a significant source of information on the distribution of mass fluctuations in the universe .",
    "moreover , the relation between peculiar velocities and mass is simple , providing a direct indication of the distribution of mass independent of assumptions about the bias factor of different galaxy types .",
    "large scales flows have been addressed both theoretically ( regs & geller 1989 , bothun et al .",
    "1990 , hiotelis 2001 ) and observationally ( dekel 1999 , cecarrelli et al .",
    "2005 , for a review see strauss & willick 1995 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the dynamical behavior of objects near regions of high density contrast can be described by the spherical infall model ( regs & geller 1989 ) with a collapsing streaming motion whose amplitude depends only on the distance to the local density maximum ( diaferio & geller 1997 ) . the predictions from the spherical infall model are often used for cluster mass estimates ( _ e.g. _ diaferio 1999 ) .",
    "gunn ( 1978 ) and peebles ( 1976 , 1980 ) derived a linear approximation to the infall velocity induced by an isotropic mass concentration described by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the average density inside a radius @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the background density .",
    "the infall velocity @xmath9 is then given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hubble constant and @xmath12 is the cosmological density parameter .",
    "yahil ( 1985 ) provides a non - linear approximation to the exact solution of the infall velocity : @xmath13^{0.25 } } ; \\label{yahil}\\ ] ] however , this equation is not accompanied by a published derivation .",
    "regs & geller ( 1989 ) , assume that clusters are spherically symmetric and obtain a solution for the non - linear infall velocity of the system as an expansion series , which is accurate before orbit crossing takes place and for @xmath14 .",
    "they also quote that this solution is inadequate for large density enhancements . therefore ,",
    "neither their calculations nor eqs . [ vlin ] or [ yahil ] , are expected to hold in or near cluster centres , or more generally in virialised regions . in order to overcome this problem , croft , dalton & efstathiou ( 1999 ) -hereafter , cde- choose to truncate the expression for @xmath15 with an exponential cutoff @xmath16 with @xmath17 , which roughly approximates the effect of the rapid decrease of infall velocities at small @xmath7 due to virialised motions ( see figure 7 in cde ) . when adding the exponential cutoff , the expression for the linear infall velocity given by eq .",

[ yahil ] ) this is : @xmath19^{0.25}}. \\label{cyahil}\\ ] ] cde claim to obtain a better fit to their simulations using this equation , but given the arbitrary nature of this truncation , they still restrict their analysis to the outer regions of haloes ( @xmath20 mpc ) .    in this paper , we explore the characteristics of streaming motions in the regions surrounding clusters using large , high resolution virgo n - body simulations , and compare these results to predictions from linear theory and the spherical infall model .",
    "we will also study the alignments between the velocity field and the positions of haloes in the numerical simulation , to determine the extent to which a radial approximation to the velocity field around high - density peaks is valid . in a related subject",
    ", we will provide a further quantification of velocity alignments by measuring the fractions of particles flowing towards haloes with respect to those staying at roughly fixed gravitational potentials , and we will compare it to the fraction of particles escaping the potential wells of haloes . in all these analyses",
    "we will also study the impact of local density on the infall and alignment of motion towards clusters .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : section 2 contains a brief description of the numerical simulations used in this work ; section 3 describes the statistical analyses and the resulting dependencies of the infall pattern on cluster mass and local density . finally , section 4 contains a summary of the conclusions drawn from this work .",
    "the numerical simulation used in this work was carried out by the virgo consortium . in particular",
    ", we use the publicly available very large simulations , vls ( yoshida et al .",
    "2001 ) , characterised by a @xmath21 model , @xmath22 particles in a cosmological box of @xmath23 mpc on a side , and a mass resolution of @xmath24 .",
    "the cosmology is characterised by a matter density parameter @xmath25 , cosmological constant @xmath26 and expansion rate at the present time @xmath27 mpc km / s where @xmath28 .",
    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) initial power spectrum was computed using the @xmath29 software ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) , and is normalised to the abundance of galaxy clusters at @xmath30 so that @xmath31 .",
    "dark - matter haloes are identified in the simulation using a standard _ friends - of - friends _ algorithm ( davis et al .",
    "1985 ) using a linking length @xmath32 , given by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the mean number density of particles ; this linking length corresponds to an overdensity @xmath35 , which characterises the virialized halo and separates it from the sorrounding infall material ( cole & lacey 1995 ) .",
    "this large simulation contains a large number of halos spanning a wide range of masses .",
    "the criteria followed in the identification of dark - matter haloes leads to @xmath36 identified systems with masses ranging from @xmath37 ( 10 particles ) to @xmath38 ( more than @xmath39 particles ) .",

    "as can be seen , even the most massive groups have similar mean - velocities than dark - matter particles ( einasto et al .",
    "2005 , shaw et al . 2005 )",
    ". however , only dark - matter particles show a high velocity tail ( @xmath51 km / s ) , whereas groups rarely reach peculiar velocity values above @xmath52 km / s ( shaw et al . 2005 ) .",
    "in this section we study the statistical properties of the velocity field in the neighborhoods of dark - matter haloes , up to scales of @xmath53 mpc .",
    "we begin by analysing the mean infall velocity of particles onto groups , and the distribution of the peculiar velocity orientation of the particles in the outskirts of the groups ( subsection [ infv ] ) . in subsection [ infa ]",
    "we study the dependence of the results on the local dark - matter density .",
    "we perform our analysis for four diferent group mass samples ( see table [ tab : samp ] ) .",
    "all our analises are performed using individual particles in the simulation as opposed to the recent use of substructure identified in simulations in several works ( see for instance benson , 2005 , and wang et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "we consider that our studies should not change importantly if we were to repeat the following analyses using substructure since we are particularly interested in regions outside the halo centres . at such distances",
    ", we expect the average velocities of individual particles and substructre to be similar .",
    "this is opposed to the clear differences inside dark - matter haloes , where dynamical friction would slow down the center of mass of a sub - halo .",
    ".description of our samples of dark - matter haloes corresponding to different ranges of mass and the number of groups identified . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : samp3 ]    we now search for possible dependencies of the fraction of infalling and outflowing particles , @xmath54 and @xmath55 defined above , on the local density of dark - matter particles . figure [ fig8 ] presents these results for our four group samples ( panels a , b , c and d for samples s1 , s2 , s3 and s4 , respectively ) for particles in low- ( dotted line ) , intermediate- ( dashed line ) and high - density ( solid line ) regions .",
    "as can be seen , the ratio @xmath55 is larger for low - density particles at small separations , whereas at larger scales , the trend is similar for particles in both , high and low density regions",
    ". inspection of panel d , indicates that an important difference of three orders of magnitude can be achieved between the number of infalling to outflowing particles for high density regions .",
    "note that this maximum occurs at a scale @xmath56 larger than that in low density regions . in high density regions , however , this difference is not so important .",
    "it should also be noticed that , although not detected in figure 6 for the overall ratios of infalling and outflowing particles , particles in the lower density regions show a minimum in @xmath57 at slightly ( marginally ) larger distances from the halo centres than the corresponding maximum in @xmath58 .",
    "( black ) and @xmath59 ( gray ) with the local density of dark - matter particles , for four subsamples of halos ( panels a , b , c and d for samples s1 , s2 , s3 and s4 , respectively ) .",
    "results for @xmath57 and @xmath58 for particles characterised by @xmath60 are shown in solid lines , whereas dashed lines shows the results for @xmath61 , and dotted lines the results for @xmath62.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]",
    "we now summarise the main conclusions we arrived at during the series of analyses performed on the vls simulations .",
    "we studied the peculiar velocity field around dark - matter haloes of varying masses , considering infall velocities , the _ infall angle _ with respect to the halo centres , and the fractions of infalling and outflowing particles .",
    "we also studied variations in these quantities as the local dark - matter particle density varies .",
    "we now list our main results and conclusions :    * the maximum infall velocity around the most massive groups identified in the numerical simulation ( @xmath63 ) , is @xmath64 km / s .",
    "the results for the lowest mass group sample ( @xmath65 ) indicate a maximum infall velocity of @xmath66 km / s , decreasing very slowly at larger distances from the halo centres . *",
    "the maximum infall velocity occurs in a narrow range of scales , @xmath67 mpc @xmath68 mpc even when considering a broad range of group masses ( @xmath69 to @xmath70 ) . * the exponential cutoff linear model analysed by croft et al . , works better for the most massive groups at small scales .",
    "it does not reproduce the infall pattern for groups samples with @xmath71 , neither the large scale infall signature onto massive systems in any of our subsamples s1 to s4 . *",
    "we find a power law relation between the maximum infall velocity and mass .",
    "the croft et al .",
    "model with an exponential overdensity cutoff provides a good fit for @xmath72 .",
    "* large mass groups show a stronger alignment between the dark - matter particle peculiar velocity and its cluster - centric position than do low mass groups .",
    "regardless of the halo mass , this maximum alignment occurs at intermediate scales , @xmath67 mpc @xmath73 mpc .",
    "* there are remarkable differences between the dynamical behaviour of low- and high - density particles .",
    "in general , higher density particles exhibit higher infall velocities and lower alignment than particles in lower density environments .",
    "the difference in infall is less evident when considering high mass haloes , and the alignment becomes similar for high and low density particles for larger distances to halo centres .",
    "however , at large enough distances , high - density particles become even more aligned than lower density particles , specially for low mass haloes .",
    "we have also considered the possibility that substructure could affect our analysis . according to the results of aubert , pichon & colombi ( 2004 ) the infall pattern of the largest halos",
    "is affected by substructure only at small scales ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "since the maxima occurs well beyond this scale , we are confident that our results are not likely to change under the presence of substructure .    in spite of the fact that mass flows toward clusters in an anisotropic fashion preferentially through the filamentary structure , the results provided give useful mean values of velocity flows which can be used to asses the systematic infall onto growing structures .",
    "the particular analysis performed provide direct measures of the maximum infall pattern and halo mass dependence and can be used to estimate gas dynamical processes such as ram pressure stripping that may initiate galaxy transformation in the outskirts of clusters .",
