    "many systems exhibit phases where the order parameter is spatially modulated and forms a pattern @xcite .",
    "these phases are the result of a frustration caused by the competition between interaction forces with opposite effects .",
    "for example , in a blend of polymers , the difference of interaction energies between homo and hetero polymers generates locally a repulsion between heteropolymers which leads to a macroscopic segregation .",
    "but for diblock co - polymers which are built with two heteropolymers a and b which are attached to each other by a chemical bond , such a macroscopic global phase separation is prohibited .",
    "they form a disordered phase at high temperature ( when the entropic effects prevail ) , but below a critical temperature , whereas energetic considerations should lead to segregation , this chemical binding prevents separation between a and b heteropolymers over a long distance : the two components a and b self - organized in patterns or domains of finite size ( mainly lamellar or hexagonal ) in order to minimize nevertheless contacts between heteropolymers en thus the energy of interaction .",
    "the relative density in heteropolymers is thus spatially periodically modulated .",
    "this spontaneous microstructuration could be helpfull to design a new generation of solar cells based on organic semi - conductors@xcite .    in all models with local interactions ,",
    "these ordered phases disappear in the strong segregation regime ( low temperature ) .",
    "it is expected , however , that these phases should persist in the case of long - range interactions , which ca nt be correctly described by a ginzburg - landau type model with only a finite number of spatial derivatives of an order parameter ( which can be defined in our preceding example from the relative density in the two components a and b ) .",
    "an alternative approach is to study the dynamics of phase transition .",
    "while , in the usual process of ostwald ripening , succession of coarsening events with doubling of the domain size leads to a total segregation , or macro - segregation , c. misbah and p. politi @xcite have shown that long - range interactions could cause an interruption of this coalescence process , stabilizing a pattern that remains consequently in a micro - structured pattern or super - crystal .",
    "we show here that this is the case for the equation of oono@xcite , which is particularly well suited to describe the dynamics of systems with a modulated phase .",
    "different equations can be used to describe the dynamics of a phase transition depending on , for example , if the order parameter is a scalar or a vector , and whether it is conserved by the dynamics or not ( for a review see @xcite ) .    as at equilibrium",
    ", this order parameter must minimize a free energy , the dynamics out of equilibrium must then involve deviation from this stable order parameter value or function , just like in a simple mechanical system .",
    "the simplest dynamics based on ginzburg - landau free energy for a scalar order parameter is the tdgl ( time - dependent ginzburg landau or model a in hohenberg and halperin classification@xcite ) which writes@xmath0    in this equation , @xmath1 is a macroscopic order parameter which is a coarse grained of a microscopic order parameter in a small volume around the postition @xmath2 .",
    "and @xmath3 is the dimensionless control parameter , usually the reduce temperature @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the critical temperature of the phase transition .",
    "this partial differential equation is invariant by the transformations @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is the ginzburg - landau free energy local density or lyapounov functional in the context of dynamical systems : @xmath9    the non - local term @xmath10 prevents discontinuity or roughness of the order parameter and assigns energetic overcost to its variations in proportion with their sharpness . when looking at the temporal evolution of the free energy @xmath11  :",
    "@xmath12    one notices from equation [ tdgl ] that the dynamics will induce a change of @xmath13 as long as it hasnt reached a minimum of the free energy density @xmath8 .",
    "if one looks for homogeneous states ( where the order parameter is independent of the spatial coordinates ) to be stationary states of this equation , they will be the extrema of the landau potential @xmath14 which is plotted in fig . 1 for the two possible signs of the control parameter .",
    "for @xmath15 , the only extremum is @xmath16 , so there is only one homogenous solution , which is stable , being a minimum of the landau potential ( which is a convex function as long as @xmath15 ) .",
    "when @xmath17 , this potential is now concave in a neighborhood of @xmath16 , which is now a maximum and thus is now linearly instable .",
    "two other symmetric solutions @xmath18 have now appeared due to this pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "they are the new stable homogeneous solutions and correspond to a minimum of the potential @xmath19 .",

    "for example , it can be the thermal fluctuations proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "this mode decomposition enables to compute the @xmath27-dependence of the amplification factor @xmath28 ( or growth rate or imaginary part of @xmath29 )  : @xmath30    @xmath31 is negative for @xmath15 , and thus the homogeneous solution @xmath16 is unstable with respect to fluctuations of the order parameter .",

    "but if there is a conservation law , as for example a conservation of mass , such an instantaneous symmetry breaking is prohibited : the matter , or the different species diffuse with a finite characteristic time .",
    "hillert @xcite , cahn and hilliard @xcite have proposed a model to describe segregation in a binary mixture .",
    "this equation , later on denoted c - h for cahn - hilliard , corresponds to model b in the hohenberg and halperin classification@xcite .",
    "cahn - hilliard dynamics is the minimal equation describing phase transition for a conserved scalar order parameter . as this conservation law prevents global symmetry breaking",

    "this dynamic governs a whole class of first order phase transition like the fredericksz transition in liquid crystals @xcite , segregation of granular media in a rotating drum@xcite , or formation of ripple due to hydrodynamic oscillations @xcite .",
    "cahn - hilliard dynamics is a modified diffusion equation for a scalar order parameter @xmath22 , which writes  : @xmath35    in the original work of cahn and hilliard , @xmath1 represents the concentration of one of the components of a binary alloy .",
    "but it can also be the fluctuation of density of a fluid around its mean value , or concentration of one chemical component of a binary mixture , or the height of a copolymer layer@xcite ..    as in model a , this equation is invariant by the transformations @xmath6 and @xmath7 and when looking at the time evolution of the local quantity @xmath36 , we still have  : @xmath37    in order to derive a conservative dynamics , such that @xmath38 , one can start from a detail balance @xcite , or from a conservation equation for the order parameter @xmath39 .",

    "stationary states of the ( c - h ) are again the extrema of the landau potential @xmath14 . and after a quench , the system undergoes a first order phase transition associated with the pitchfork bifurcation from the @xmath16 solution to the symmetric solutions @xmath47 .",
    "but due to the conservation law , the dynamics is different as cahn and hilliard have shown via the linear stability analysis of equation ( [ ch ] ) around @xmath16.@xmath48 one gets for the amplification factor in the fourier space @xmath28  : @xmath49    [ ptb ]    .. / .. /figure3.bmp    so , as @xmath31 is negative for @xmath15 , the @xmath16 solution is stable with respect to small fluctuations of the order parameter",
    ". for negative @xmath3 , fig [ amplipli ] shows a band of instable fourier modes , as @xmath33 for @xmath32 . moreover , linear stability analysis of c - h predicts that the most instable mode is not anymore for @xmath34 but for @xmath50 ( for which @xmath51 ) .",
    "this wave number of maximum amplification factor will dominate the first stage of the dynamics which is called the spinodal decomposition ; this explains in particular why the homogeneous domains appear at length scales close to @xmath52 , half the wave length associated with the instability . for longer times , interfaces separating each domain",
    "interact through ostwald ripening or coarsening , causing @xmath53 to change slowly toward higher values .",
    "when the equation is studied for a constant negative @xmath3 , via a rescaling of @xmath22 ( as @xmath54 ) , position @xmath2 ( as @xmath55 ) and time ( as @xmath56 ) , we observe that we could restrict the dynamics to the case @xmath57 .",
    "so later on , we will study the equation @xmath58    in 1d , a family of stationary solution of this nonlinear dynamics is the so - called interface - lattice solutions ( or soliton - lattice ) , which writes  : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the jacobian elliptic function sine - amplitude , or cnoidal mode .",
    "this family of solutions is parametrized by the jacobian modulus @xmath61   $ ] , or `` segregation parameter '' .",

    "the absolute minimum for @xmath74 is for @xmath75 and @xmath76 , i.e. for complete segregation with a single interface .",
    "the dynamics starts initially with @xmath77 , for which @xmath78 describes a sinusoidal modulation of almost vanishing amplitude around the high temperature homogenous stationary solution @xmath16",
    "@xmath79 @xmath80 the spinodal decomposition dynamics will saturate and reach a stationary state which is a periodic pattern with a finite domain length ( weak segregation regime ) for which @xmath81 , and @xmath82 so as to satisfy ( [ implicit ] ) , i.e @xmath64 is solution of the implicit equation : @xmath83 the amplitude of the modulation is then @xmath84 , which is different from @xmath85 .    using linear stability analysis ,",
    "langer has shown that the stationary profile thus obtained , @xmath86 , is destroyed by stochastic thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "he has identified the most instable mode as an antiferro  mode , leading to an infinite cascade of period doubling @xcite .",
    "disorder of the pattern is also a cause of ostwald ripening : if the periodicity of the interface - lattice is broken , either when the distance between theses interfaces or when the bulk value in the different domains become non - constant , coarsening is triggered by diffusion of matter between neighboring domains : big domains will then absorb smaller ones @xcite .",
    "when considering the c - h equation [ ch ] as a diffusion equation , p. politi and c. misbah have shown that there should be coarsening as long as @xmath87d@xmath69 is positive , where @xmath88 is the amplitude of the modulation and @xmath69 its @xcite . as in cahn - hilliard dynamics",
    "@xmath89 are two growing functions of the parameter @xmath64 , this diffusion coefficient will always remain positive and coarsening will proceed until @xmath90 ( as in fig .",
    "[ politi ] left ) .",
    "[ h ]    .. / .. /hdr / politi - misbah1.jpg    when looking at figure ( [ potlandau ] ) , one can see that the bulk energy is decreasing when the amplitude varies from @xmath91 to @xmath92 , that is , when the segregation increase .",
    "meanwhile , the interfacial energy is proportional to the period , we finally get that the total energy decreases when the period of the stationary solutions gets longer and longer .",
    "but for other dynamics ( as in fig .",
    "[ politi ] right ) , d@xmath93d@xmath69 can change of sign as we will see in the following : segregation then remains partial .",
    "politi et c. misbah speak then of interrupted coarsening .",
    "we would like to work out the period of modulated phase systems for which there is a competition between two types of interactions : a short - range interaction which tends to make the system more homogeneous together with a long - range one , or a non - local one , which prefers proliferation of domain walls .",
    "this competition results in a microphase separation with a preferred mesoscopic length scale .",
    "these systems forming a super - crystal can be studied using a modified landau - ginzburg approach , derived from cahn - hilliard equation  and of practical use for numerical simulations @xcite:@xmath94    the @xmath95 term models in the cahn - hilliard equation the long - range interactions , which prevents the formation of macroscopic domains and favors the modulation .",
    "we will see that the inclusion of such a term , following oono , enables to describe the behavior of modulated systems at @xmath26 much lower than @xmath5 .",
    "if we suppose , for example , that in a 3d problem , the long - range interaction decreases like @xmath96 , the full free energy density writes @xmath97@xmath98    where @xmath99 in d=3 , or @xmath100 in d=1@xmath101the long - range interaction @xmath102 corresponds to a repulsive interaction when @xmath103 and @xmath104 are of the same sign : thus it  favors the formation of interphases .",
    "if we want to study the dynamic of this phase separation , we use the cahn - hilliard equation  : @xmath105@xmath106 if one recalls that @xmath107 is the green s function associated with the laplacian operator @xmath108 in 3d , the preceding equation then transforms into @xmath109@xmath110 which leads to equation ( [ oono ] ) . note that , even with the new term added by oono to the usual cahn - hilliard dynamics , this equation remains in the class of the conservative models , as it derives from a equation of conservation .",
    "note also that the free energy @xmath111 is infinite if @xmath104 is of the same sign in a macroscopic domain .",
    "if we look at the linear stability analysis of the homogenous solution @xmath16 , we found almost the same results as in the original work of cahn and hilliard , except that the amplification factor @xmath31  now write:@xmath112    this shows immediately that @xmath16 is linearly instable if @xmath113 , with a band of unstable fourier modes @xmath114 ( for which @xmath33 ) .",
    "the most unstable mode is for @xmath115 like in the simplest cahn - hilliard model([ch ] ) .",
    "therefore , during the initial stage of the dynamics , the spinodal decomposition the homogeneous domains appear at length scales close to @xmath116 , as in the usual cahn hilliard dynamics .",
    "but one sees that , contrary to the simple cahn - hilliard case , the long wave length modulations are now stable as @xmath117 for @xmath118 .",
    "this explains qualitatively why , for any finite value of @xmath119 , the dynamics will end in a micro segregated regime , as it is observed numerically and as we will discuss quantitatively below .",
    "it has been noticed in different models @xcite that , if the interaction responsible of the modulation is local ( i.e. described in the free energy by local terms only , like @xmath120 in the swift hohenberg model ) , then for low temperature or small @xmath119 , the macrosegregated regime ( one unique interface ) will be energetically favored compared to the microphase separation .",
    "however , in this model by oono , because the interaction is long range ( i.e. non - local ) , no matter how small is @xmath119 , there will always be a finite region around @xmath34 where @xmath117 .",
    "indeed , @xmath121 . consequently",
    ", a modulated phase should always end the dynamics@xcite .      for d=1 ,",
    "the contribution of the long - range interaction to the free energy per unit length is @xcite@xmath122 when using as ansatz the family of interface - lattice solutions  @xmath123 , we then obtain@xmath124 thus , this contribution is independent of @xmath125and the only minimization is with respect to @xmath64 .",
    "consequently , the minimization with respect to @xmath69 concerns only @xmath8 and enables to find @xmath69 as a function of @xmath64 : @xmath126 . and",
    "the minimization of the free energy @xmath127 is simply with respect to a single variable @xmath64 , which can be done numerically for different values of the interaction strength @xmath128 .",
    "figure [ goldstonefig ] presents @xmath129 which scales like @xmath130 .",
    "[ h ]    .. / .. /hdr",
    "/ fig2.bmp      the family ( [ ansatz ] ) is not anymore an exact stationary solution of the dynamics ( [ oono ] ) because of its last term .",
    "nevertheless , it is a good candidate for an approximate solution ( especially in the case of small @xmath131 ) and thus can be used as a tool for calculation using a solvability condition or fredholm s alternative .",
    "indeed , we can write deviation from a given periodic stationary profile of period @xmath69 as @xmath132 where @xmath3 is a small parameter and @xmath133 is a periodic function of the phase @xmath134 . for a steady state solution",
    "@xmath135 with @xmath136 in the general case @xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 i.e. @xmath140 is now a slowly varying function of @xmath141 and @xmath142 @xmath143 if we denote @xmath144 , then  the local wave number is @xmath145 and @xmath146@xmath147 where we have kept only the first order terms in @xmath148 .",
    "if we consider a stationary profile @xmath133 which satisfies ( zero order equation ) : @xmath149@xmath150 oono s equation ( [ oono ] ) becomes then at order one in @xmath148 @xmath151@xmath152@xmath153@xmath154 where we have used @xmath155 and equation ( [ primitiv ] ) to simplify @xmath156 .",
    "so oono s equation ( [ oono ] ) writes @xmath157@xmath158      a necessary condition for a solution to exist is that the left - hand side of the system is orthogonal to the kernel of the adjoint operator @xmath159;if @xmath160ker@xmath161then the solvability condition ( or fredholm alternative ) writes:@xmath162 as for any @xmath163 we have @xmath164 this adjoint operator writes : @xmath165    if @xmath160ker@xmath166 , we can define @xmath167 such that @xmath168 and which satisfies@xmath169 using equation ( [ primitiv ] ) , we thus find that @xmath163 defined by @xmath170=@xmath171=@xmath172 is an element of ker@xmath173.as a consequence , the diffusion equation writes @xmath174    as @xmath175 and @xmath176 we get the equality@xmath177@xmath178 and consequently equation ( [ misbah1 ] ) is a diffusion equation @xmath179",
    "as long as the diffusion coefficient is negative ( due to the @xmath180 term ) , the coarsening process goes on , in order to minimize interfacial energy .",
