    "this confirms that a well - defined energy function is being measured . at the extremes ( near extension 0  @xmath68 m and 0.05  @xmath68 m ) the value of @xmath91 is larger , indicating that the @xmath34 curves are inconsistent at large and small extension .",
    "the larger @xmath91 values are found in regimes of extension where the hairpin is either fully open or fully folded",
    ". when the constraint is positioned to stabilize the hairpin in the fully open or fully closed conformation , the conformational dynamics of the hairpin itself are minimal and the fluctuations in the measured extension are mainly due to thermal fluctuation in the extension of the double - stranded dna handles . at small extensions ,",
    "the problem is exacerbated by the fact that the average force is low , resulting in lower effective stiffness of the handles and increased fluctuations .",
    "these measurement errors blur the sharp cutoff that would otherwise appear in the probability density of extension as the hairpin approaches the fully - open or fully - folded state and similarly blur the energy function .",
    "the @xmath91 function alerts us to the fact that the energy surface is accurately measured in the transition state region , but is affected by systematic errors near the fully folded or fully unfolded state .",
    "we also apply the criterion based on eq .",
    "[ eq : diag1 ] and show the results in fig .  [",
    "fig : ediagnostic](b ) .",
    "the fact that linear curves are obtained when the unbiased energies are subtracted indicate that the intrinsic energy of the hairpin cancels , as expected , and that the effective biasing potential has the expected parabolic shape .",
    "this is confirmation that the optical trapping apparatus is applying an accurate biasing potential to the hairpin .",
    "based on fig .",
    "[ fig : ediagnostic ] we conclude that the energy of the hairpin is a well - defined function of extension and that desa has produced an accurate measurement of the transition state region .    in order to verify the desa result , the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeseries ] was also analyzed using wham , as defined by eqs  [ eq : wham1 ] and [ eq : wham2 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : desawham](a ) the energy surface obtained by wham is plotted along with the energy surface obtained from integration of the @xmath0 curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dedxd ] . the desa and wham curves are indistinguishable .",
    "the overall slope of the energy landscape is reproduced , as well as the ripples that arise from the sequence dependence of the dna hybridization energy .",
    "the sequence dependence is more apparent in the plot of @xmath0 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : desawham](b ) . as in the case of the energy , results obtained from desa and wham",
    "are indistinguishable .",
    "there are systems , such as pseudoknots , g - quadruplex dna and others , which exhibit large irreversible steps when disrupted in single molecule experiments@xcite . in such cases",
    ", the techniques described here would not be suitable for reconstructing the global energy landscape .",
    "the main obstacle is that it is impossible to apply a biasing potential which will stabilize the system in the transition state or states .",
    "both wham and desa require that the histograms of the reaction coordinate obtained with different biasing potentials have substantial overlap .",
    "nonequilibrium analysis methods have been developed which can determine the energy surface from data taken far from equilibrium@xcite .",
    "these methods typically require a great deal of experimental data , since they involve measuring the dependence of the disruption force on force loading rate or averaging many trajectories with weights determined by the external work performed .    in cases",
    "where biasing potentials can be used to stabilize a system along the reaction coordinate , desa is an alternative to wham .",
    "we have shown that desa and wham produce indistinguishable results when applied to simulated and experimental data . however , desa has the advantage of being computationally simple compared with wham , which requires the self - consistent solution of a system of nonlinear equations ( eq .",
    "[ eq : wham2 ] ) .",
    "another advantage of desa is that the construction of @xmath0 provides direct visual cues which can be used to confirm that the different biasing potentials are sampling the same energy surface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dedxd ] ) .",
    "in addition , the two diagnostic criteria defined in section  [ sec : diagnostics ] provide quantitative measures of the quality of the energy surface measurement .",
    "the signatures of an ill - defined energy surface are demonstrated in the analysis of data generated by simulation system ii . finally , using the desa diagnostics",
    ", we show that it is possible to apply a precisely controlled biasing potential in an experimental system and obtain highly accurate information about the shape of the energy surface for folding and unfolding .",
