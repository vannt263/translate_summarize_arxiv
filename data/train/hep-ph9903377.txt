    "the production of isolated photons in high - energy hadronic collisions is an important testing ground for qcd .",
    "since the photon does not take part in the strong interaction , it is a `` direct '' probe of the hard scattering process and provides a means to measure the strong coupling constant @xmath2 or to extract information on the parton distributions , in particular the gluon density in the proton @xcite .",
    "moreover , good knowledge of the standard model predictions for direct photon production is required since it is an important background for many searches of new physics .    at hera , with increasing luminosity",
    ", the measurement of isolated photon production will give information on the parton content of the proton and at @xmath3 , i.e. for photoproduction , also on the parton distributions in the photon .",
    "first experimental results from the zeus collaboration @xcite ( see also @xcite ) have been reported and found in reasonable agreement with next - to - leading order ( nlo ) predictions @xcite .",
    "cross sections for the production of hard photons in deep inelastic scattering are much smaller as compared to photoproduction and , therefore , more difficult to measure .",
    "typical cross sections , for example with @xmath4 , are of the order of @xmath5 . with a luminosity of @xmath6",
    "one thus expects measurements of differential cross sections to become feasible .    a nlo calculation for direct photon production in deep inelastic @xmath1 scattering , @xmath7 , at large",
    "@xmath0 has been reported recently by two of us and d. michelsen @xcite .",
    "since hard photon production occurs , compared to inclusive deep inelastic scattering , at a relative order o(@xmath8 ) one expects a sizable cross section only at moderately large @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , one can restrict the calculation to pure virtual photon exchange with @xmath9 exchange neglected . in @xcite the hadronic final state",
    "is separated into @xmath10- and @xmath11-jet topologies ( the remnant jet being counted as `` + 1 '' jet us usual ) .",
    "the approach is thus analogous to the calculation of @xmath12- and @xmath13-jet cross sections , where one of the final state gluons is replaced by a photon @xcite .",
    "in addition to the direct production , photons can also be produced through the fragmentation of a hadronic jet into a single photon carrying a large fraction of the jet energy @xcite .",
    "this long - distance process is described in terms of the quark - to - photon and gluon - to - photon fragmentation functions which absorb collinear singularities present in the perturbative calculation .",
    "first measurements of the @xmath14 fragmentation function in @xmath15-jet are presented in @xcite ( see also @xcite for the discussion of an inclusive measurement ) . the nlo theory for this process",
    "has been worked out in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the fragmentation contributions were discarded and the photon - quark collinear singularities had been removed by explicit parton - level cutoffs .",
    "the results depended strongly on these photon - parton cutoffs , in particular for the incoming gluon contributions @xcite .",
    "however , these cutoffs are difficult to control experimentally .",
    "in this paper we report results in which the fragmentation contributions are included together with isolation criteria that limit the hadronic energy in the jet containing the photon . whereas in @xcite various photon",
    "+ jet cross sections with invariant mass jet resolution criteria were calculated , in this work we concentrate on the calculation of various differential cross sections either exclusively or inclusively which depend on the transverse momenta and rapidities of the photon or the accompanying jet .",
    "we use the @xmath16 center - of - mass system to define the kinematic variables .",
    "the cone method is applied to define the parton jets and to isolate the photon signal .    in section 2 a brief outline of the theoretical background for calculating the cross section",
    "is given . in section",
    "3 numerical results are presented .",
    "section 4 contains a short summary and the conclusions .",
    "in leading order , the production of photons in deep inelastic electron ( positron ) scattering is described by the quark ( antiquark ) subprocess @xmath17 where the particle momenta are given in parentheses .",
    "the momentum of the incoming quark is a fraction @xmath18 of the proton momentum @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the proton remnant @xmath21 has the momentum @xmath22 .",
    "it hadronizes into the remnant jet so that the process ( 1 ) gives rise to @xmath10-jet final states . in the virtual photon @xmath23-proton center - of - mass system",
    "the hard photon recoils against the hard jet back - to - back . to remove photon production by incoming photons @xmath23 with small virtuality ( photoproduction channel ) and to restrict to the case where the scattered electron @xmath24 is observed",
    ", one applies cuts on the usual deep inelastic scattering variables @xmath25 and @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , to have photons @xmath26 of sufficient energy we require an explicit cut on the invariant mass @xmath27 of the final state , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the electron momentum transfer , @xmath30 and @xmath31 as usual . both leptons and quarks emit photons .",
    "the subset of diagrams where the photon is emitted from the initial or final state lepton ( leptonic radiation ) is explicitly gauge invariant and can be considered separately .",
    "similarly , the diagrams with a photon emitted from quark lines is called quarkonic radiation . in addition",
    ", there are also contributions from the interference of these two .",
    "since we are interested in testing qcd under the circumstances that the photon is emitted from quarks the contributions from leptonic radiation are viewed as a background and must be suppressed .",
    "this can easily be done by a cut on the photon emission angle with respect to the incoming electron @xcite . in our numerical evaluation",
    "we include this background source as well as the interference contribution .    at lowest order ,",
    "each parton is identified with a jet and the photon is automatically isolated from the quark jet by requiring a non - zero transverse momentum of the photon or jet in the @xmath23-proton center - of - mass frame .",
    "therefore the photon fragmentation contribution is absent at this order .      at nlo ,",
    "processes with an additional gluon , either in the final state or in the initial state , must be taken into account , i.e.    @xmath32    where the momenta of the particles are again given in parentheses .",
    "in addition , virtual corrections ( one - loop diagrams at o(@xmath2 ) ) to the lo process ( 1 ) have to be included .",
    "the complete matrix elements for ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are given in @xcite .",
    "the processes ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) contribute both to the @xmath10-jets cross section , as well as to the cross section for @xmath33-jets . in the latter case each parton in the final state of ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) builds a jet on its own , whereas for @xmath34-jets a pair of final state partons is experimentally unresolved .",
    "the exact criteria for combining two partons into one jet will be introduced when we present our results .",
    "following the customary experimental procedure the resolution constraints will be based on the cone algorithm .    in the calculation of the cross section for @xmath10-jets we encounter the well - known infrared and collinear singularities .",
    "they appear for the processes ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) in those phase space regions where two partons are degenerate to one parton , i.e. when one of the partons becomes soft or two partons become collinear to each other .",
    "the singularities are assigned either to the initial state ( isr ) or to the final state ( fsr ) .",
    "contributions involving the product of an isr and a fsr factor are separated by partial fractioning .",
    "the fsr singularities cancel against singularities from the virtual corrections to the lo process ( 1 ) . for the isr singularities ,",
    "this cancellation is incomplete and the remaining singular contributions have to be factorized and absorbed into the renormalized parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) of the proton .    to accomplish this procedure ,",
    "the singularities are isolated in an analytic calculation with the help of dimensional regularization .",
    "this is difficult for the complete cross sections of the processes ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "after partial fractioning , the phase - space slicing method @xcite is used to separate the singular regions in the 4-particle phase space and to determine in these regions the approximated matrix elements and phase space factors . in those regions only , the calculation is performed analytically .",
    "for this purpose a slicing cut @xmath35 is applied to the scaled invariant masses @xmath36 , where @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath35 must be chosen small enough , so that terms of the order o(@xmath35 ) , which are discarded due to the singular approximation , are so small that an accuracy of a few percent can be achieved for the final result .    to be somewhat more explicit ,",
    "let us assume that by partial fractioning the contribution proportional to the pole term @xmath39 has been isolated in the matrix element @xmath40 for the process ( 2 ) . in the infrared region @xmath41 the two invariants @xmath42 and @xmath43 vanish .",
    "then the integration over these two variables is performed : ( @xmath44 ) over the singular region ( s ) , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , analytically with @xmath47 dimensions and using the singular approximation ; ( @xmath48 ) over the finite region ( f ) , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , numerically without any approximation to @xmath40 and in 4 dimensions ; and ( @xmath51 ) over the explicit two - parton region ( r ) , @xmath49 , @xmath52 , also numerically .",
    "this separation yields two contributions , the parton - level @xmath10-jets , which come from the integration over the regions ( s ) and ( f ) and the parton - level @xmath53-jets contribution , which corresponds to the integration over the region ( r ) .",
    "all the remaining phase space integrations are performed numerically with usual monte carlo routines . for the physical cross sections defined in the next section , which are obtained by adding the contributions from the regions s , f and r , of course , and after adding the virtual contributions and performing the subtraction of the remaining isr collinear singularities , the dependence on the slicing parameter @xmath35 cancels .",
    "this has been checked in @xcite .",
    "this means that the cut - off @xmath35 is purely technical .    in addition , the matrix elements @xmath40 for the processes ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) have _ photonic _ infrared and collinear singularities , i.e.  due to soft or collinear photons . the infrared singularity can not occur since we require a sufficiently large photon energy @xmath54 . but collinear singularities are present in general . in the earlier work @xcite",
    "these @xmath29-@xmath55 collinear contributions were eliminated by an isolation cut on the photon of the form @xmath56 with a sufficiently large isolation parameter @xmath57 which was considered as a physical cut . in this approach ,",
    "the photon was considered as a special parton , which was always isolated from all other partons in the initial and final state .",
    "such a photon isolation is very difficult to impose experimentally , since it refers to a separation of the photon from partons , whereas in the experiment only hadrons are measured directly which are recombined to jets .",
    "in addition , it was found in @xcite that the results , in particular for the gluon - initiated process ( 3 ) , depend strongly on the isolation cut @xmath57 . in ( 3 ) the photon can become collinear to two final state partons , namely @xmath29 and @xmath58 , which explains the stronger dependence compared to the process ( 2 ) , where there is only one quark ( or antiquark ) in the final state .",
    "although under the kinematical conditions assumed in @xcite the contribution of the process ( 3 ) was only some fraction of the total cross section for @xmath59-jets , the @xmath57 dependence of the final result was undesirable . in a more systematic treatment",
    "the @xmath57 dependence can be avoided by adding contributions from the quark - to - photon fragmentation function ( ff ) . in order to achieve this",
    "we include the contributions to @xmath40 from ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , where @xmath60 with @xmath61 in ( 2 ) and @xmath61 and 6 in ( 3 ) .",
    "this leads to collinear divergent contributions which are regulated by dimensional regularization .",
    "the divergent part is absorbed into the bare photon ff to yield the renormalized ff denoted by @xmath62 .",
    "the additional fragmentation contribution , which includes the contributions from the region @xmath60 ( @xmath63 ) , has , for example , for the process ( 2 ) the following form @xmath64 where @xmath65 in ( 4 ) is given by @xcite @xmath66 @xmath67 is the lo quark - to - photon splitting function @xmath68    and @xmath69 is the electric quark charge .",
    "@xmath70 stands for the non - perturbative ff of the transition @xmath14 at the factorization scale @xmath71 .",
    "this function will be specified in the next section when we present our results . the second term in ( 5 )",
    ", if substituted in ( 4 ) , is the finite part of the result of the integration over the collinear region @xmath72 . as will be explicitly shown in @xcite , the @xmath73 dependence in ( 5 ) cancels the dependence of the numerically evaluated @xmath59-jet cross section restricted to the region @xmath74 , investigated in @xcite . the variable @xmath75 stands for the fraction of the photon energy in terms of the energy of the quark that emits the photon .",
    "suppose the photon is emitted from the final state quark with 4-momentum @xmath76 , then @xmath75 can be related to the invariants @xmath77 and @xmath78 @xmath79    the fragmentation contribution is proportional to the cross section for @xmath80 , which is of o(@xmath2 ) and well known .",
    "it must be convoluted with the function in ( 5 ) as indicated in ( 4 ) to obtain the contribution to the cross section for @xmath81 at @xmath82 .",
    "equivalent formulas are used to calculate the fragmentation contributions to the channel ( 3 ) and in the case where the quark in the initial and final state is replaced by an antiquark in ( 2 ) .",
    "the results presented in this section are obtained for energies and kinematical cuts appropriate for the hera experiments .",
    "the energies of the incoming electron ( positron ) and proton are @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "the cuts on the usual dis variables are @xmath85 to eliminate the background from lepton radiation @xcite we require @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the emission angle of the photon measured with respect to the momentum of the incoming electron in the hera laboratory frame .",
    "the cut on @xmath88 suppresses leptonic radiation from the final - state electron .",
    "the pdf s of the proton are taken from @xcite ( mrst ) and @xmath2 is calculated from the two - loop formula with the same @xmath89 value ( @xmath90 ) as used in the mrst parametrization of the proton pdf .",
    "the scale in @xmath2 and the fractorization scale are equal and fixed to @xmath0 .",
    "we are interested in the differential two - particle inclusive cross section @xmath91 at nlo ( up to @xmath82 ) , where @xmath92 represents the four - vector momentum of the @xmath93 or jet .",
    "the @xmath10-jet cross section receives contributions from leading and next - to - leading order and the @xmath53-jet cross section from leading order only . in the latter case ,",
    "only @xmath94-parton - level jets contribute , while each parton including the photon build a jet on their own .",
    "the evaluation of the @xmath10-jet cross section is based on two separate contributions , a set of two - body contributions , i.e. @xmath95 parton - level jet , and a set of three - body contributions , i.e. @xmath96 parton - level jets . in this definition of parton - level jets",
    "the remnant jet @xmath97 is not counted whereas the photon is considered also as a parton , like @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "each set of contributions is completely finite as all infrared and collinear singularities have been canceled or absorbed into the proton pdf or the quark - to - photon ff .",
    "each contribution to the @xmath10-jet cross section depends separately on the slicing parameter @xmath35 .",
    "the analytic contributions are valid only for very small @xmath35 .",
    "separately , the two contributions have no physical meaning . for the contributions to the @xmath100-jet cross section coming from @xmath101 parton - level jets , a slicing cut @xmath57 for the photon",
    "is introduced . after adding the photon fragmentation contribution",
    "this sample becomes independent of @xmath57 , i.e.  also @xmath57 has the status of a technical cut like @xmath35 . in the @xmath102 parton - level jet event sample",
    "the photon is isolated from @xmath29 and @xmath58 by requiring a non - zero transverse momentum of the photon in the @xmath103 center - of - mass frame .",
    "the two technical cuts @xmath35 and @xmath57 serve only to distinguish the phase space regions , where the integrations have been done analytically with arbitrary dimensions from those where they have been done numerically in four dimensions .",
    "these two parameters must be chosen sufficiently small to justify the neglect of terms proportional to @xmath35 and @xmath57 , respectively in the analytical part of the calculations .",
    "we found that @xmath104 and @xmath105 is sufficient to fulfill this requirement .    in order to comply with the jet definitions in future analyses of experimental measurements",
    "the partons and the photon in the @xmath94 parton - level jet sample are recombined to @xmath10-jets using the cone algorithm of the snowmass convention @xcite . in this recombination scheme",
    "the photon is treated like any other parton ( so - called democratic algorithm ) . in the @xmath106 center - of - mass frame ,",
    "two partons @xmath44 and @xmath107 are combined into a jet @xmath108 if they obey the cone constraint @xmath109 , where @xmath110 @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the rapidity and azimuthal angle of the recombined jet .",
    "these variables are obtained by taking the averages of the corresponding variables of the recombined partons @xmath44 and @xmath107 multiplied with their @xmath113 values .",
    "the @xmath113 of jet @xmath108 is the sum of @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "we choose @xmath116 . in some cases , an ambiguity may occur , when two partons @xmath44 and @xmath107 qualify both as two individual jets @xmath44 and @xmath107 and as a combined jet @xmath108 . in this case",
    "we count only the combined jet @xmath108 to avoid double counting .",
    "the rapidity is always defined positive in the direction of the proton remnant momentum .",
    "the azimuthal angle is defined with respect to the scattering plane given by the momentum of the beam and the scattered electron .",
    "one of the recombined jets may be the photon jet . to qualify a jet as a photon jet we restrict the hadronic energy in this jet by requiring @xmath117    @xmath118 and @xmath119 denote the transverse momenta of the photon and the parton producing hadrons in this jet , respectively . for our predictions",
    "we choose @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "eventually the parameter @xmath121 ( or @xmath122 ) must be chosen in accordance with the experimental analysis .",
