    "following the implementation of the linear - response theory@xcite and the berry phase approach@xcite to the electron polarization within the local - spin density approximation ( lsda ) , there has been tremendous progress in understanding the properties of piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials from a microscopic standpoint . indeed ,",
    "spontaneous polarization , piezoelectric constants , and born effective charges ( bec ) , as well as full phonon spectra and potential energy surfaces can be calculated from first - principles giving thus a detailed picture of the electronic and structural behavior .    the born effective charges ( bec ) , i.e. the change in electron polarization upon ionic displacements , are the main subject of this paper .",
    "they play an important role in the physics of ferroelectric and even piezolectric materials , since they contribute to the lo - to phonon frequency splitting at @xmath0 ( which is characteristically large in ferroelectric materials@xcite ) and to the piezoelectric tensor.@xcite furthermore , the behavior of the bec is highly non - trivial since it is related to the microscopic electron current produced in a system by a change of the atomic position.@xcite this current may give a contribution to the bec which is unrelated and additional to the static electron charge carried by the ion during the displacement , so that the bec can be much bigger than their static counterpart . in this case the bec are usually referred to as anomalous .",
    "interestingly , the bec are found to be highly anomalous in the high - temperature ( i.e. centrosymmetric ) phase of many ferroelectric compounds . in particular , they are anomalous for the whole family of ferroelectric perovskites,@xcite and for the class of iv - vi chalcogenides , @xcite . since",
    "both the bec anomaly and the mechanism of the ferroelectric phase transition in most of the ferroelectric perovskites can be related to the hybridization of anion p and cation d orbitals@xcite , the interesting hypothesis arises that a large value of the bec might be an indicator of the ferroelectric materials , or materials which are on the verge of a ferroelectric transition .",
    "however , according to recent calculations the bec do not appear to posses such a predictive capability in general .",
    "on one hand they are found to be anomalous in a magnetic perovskite ( camno@xmath1@xcite ) which is far from ferroelectric . on the other hand",
    "they are non - anomalous in the ferroelectromagnet ymno@xmath1 , which belongs to the family of the hexagonal manganese oxides@xcite , whose ferroelectric transition is driven not by chemical activity ( e.g. anion - cation hybridization changes ) but by structural collapse and oxygen rotations.@xcite    so we see that the meaning of the bec and origin of the anomalous part are far from being completely clarified . while the role of covalent bonding in favoring spontaneous polarization and large bec in ferroelectric perovskites is well understood,@xcite other aspects which can strongly influence the values of the bec , like the metallic character and the strong electron correlation correlation ,",
    "have been scarcely investigated so far .    in an insulator on the verge of an insulating - to - metal transition",
    ", the bec can diverge to anomalously large values , thus indicating an electron current which can freely flow through the system in response to the electric field associated with an ionic displacement.@xcite even more interesting is the effect of strong electron - correlation . in a series of papers ishihara and co - workers@xcite showed that in a two - band , hubbard model , the introduction of strongly - correlated effects ( namely the on - site coulomb energy ) induces a strong enhancement of the electron - phonon coupling which becomes divergent at the transition boundary from the weakly - correlated ( small u ) to the strongly - correlated regime ( large u ) .",
    "resta and sorella @xcite showed that , in the same model , in the region of the transition boundary , the bec are divergent and undergo a sign change ( i.e. the electron current changes its direction flowing from the cation to the anion ) for large u.    later the same authors introduced the concept of electron localization length@xcite ( @xmath2 ) as a measure to discriminate between the metallic regime ( where @xmath2=@xmath3 ) and the insulating regime . within the same hubbard model , they found that the bec and @xmath2 diverge simultaneously for the same value of u ( i.e. the bec diverge in the metallic state ) ,    despite these predictions from model hamiltonians , to our knowledge very few attempts have been made to calculate these properties for strongly - correlated materials from first - principles .",
    "the main reason is likely the questionable reliabilty of lsda calculations for describing the electronic properties of strongly localized , atomic - like , electron states .",
    "it is common knowledge , indeed , that the lsda is often inaccurate in describing these systems.@xcite however , there is increasing evidence that many of the lsda failures are not due to the lack of genuine many - body electron correlation , but rather to the presence of the spurious self interaction ( si ) within the lsda functional,@xcite which becomes particularly strong for spatially localized electron charges .",
    "the effects of the si were first studied by perdew and zunger@xcite on atoms .",
    "subsequently svane and co - workers@xcite implemented a self - interaction - corrected ( sic ) scheme for extended systems , obtaining large improvements over the lsda results for the electronic properties of transition metal oxides and high - t@xmath4 superconductors .",
    "however their method was not simple and general enough to be extensively applied to a vast range of systems , thus the capabilities and the performance of the sic remained largely untested .",
    "recently we developed a self - interaction free pseudopotential scheme ( pseudo - sic)@xcite based on the idea ( originally conceived by vogel and co - workers@xcite ) of expressing the si as a non - local , pseudopotential - like projector .",
    "this approach has the advantage of being applicable to a vast generality of systems including semiconductors and metals , magnetic and non magnetic materials , without requiring large modifications or a large increase of computing effort with respect to the usual lsda .",
    "the pseudo - sic is close in spirit to the popular lda+u@xcite since removing the si is analogous to effectively mapping the on - site energy u into the one - electron picture , so that both weakly - correlated materials and mott - insulators can be treated on the same foot . in ref .",
    "we showed that the method is accurate in describing the band energies of iii - v and ii - vi semiconductors ( e.g. gan and zno ) , transition metal monoxides ( nio , mno ) and hexagonal ferroelectrics ( ymno@xmath1 ) .",
    "in this paper we apply the pseudo - sic to the study of the bec for a range of different materials including a prototypical ferroelectric perovskite ( batio@xmath1 ) , a ferroelectric with extremely high bec ( gete ) , a magnetic perovskites ( camno@xmath1 ) and two magnetic monoxides ( mno and nio ) .",
    "this investigation aims to furnish a more complete and accurate picture of the bec , and to spread light on the meaning of their anomalous values .",
    "we show that the bec anomaly is not a property of ferroelectric materials , but is instead present in ionic insulators whenever the energy difference between filled anion and empty cation bands is particularly small ( less than 3 ev ) , or in materials with nearly metallic behavior .",
    "furthermore , we give evidence that the effect of strong correlation systematically reduces the value of the bec and of the electron localization length .",
    "this decrease is particularly evident for the bec which are descibed as highly anomalous within lda ( or lsda ) .",
    "thus , part of ( but not all ) the bec anomaly found within lda is a consequence of the unphysical self - interaction which overemphasizes the orbital hybridization and the sensitivity of the electron - phonon coupling to the atomic displacement .    finally , we propose an interpretation of the bec in terms of occupation and capacity of the filled and empty orbitals , respectively , which allows a qualitative understanding of the anomaly in a general case .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ form ] we briefly illustrate the pseudo - sic scheme , and the formulation used for the bec calculation . section [ results ] is devoted to the presentation and the discussion of our results , and in section [ conclusions ] we give our final remarks .",
    "here we briefly summarize the main features of the pseudo - sic approach . a detailed discussion of the formalism and the assumptions which are at the basis of this method can be found in ref .",
    "the formalism uses ultrasoft pseudopotentials ( uspp@xcite ) which give optimal transferability and require low cut - off energies even for transition metal atoms .",
    "the si - free , kohn - sham equations are :    @xmath5|\\psi^{\\sigma}_{n{\\bf k}}\\rangle= \\epsilon^{\\sigma}_{n{\\bf k}}\\,|\\psi^{\\sigma}_{n{\\bf k}}\\rangle , \\label{ks - sic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 is the non - local pseudopotential , @xmath7 the screening potential , and @xmath8 the sic term .",
    "this is expressed as a fully - non local , kleinman - bylander - type , pseudopotential projector :    @xmath9    @xmath10    here @xmath11 is a composite index which runs over angular quantum numbers and atomic positions , @xmath12 are atomic pseudowavefunctions , @xmath13 are the si potentials of the fully occupied spin - polarized atomic pseudocharges @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are the corresponding occupation numbers .",
    "the second term in eq . [ vsic ] is the augmented contribution required if using uspp ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 are projector functions and augmented charge desities,@xcite respectively ) , whereas for ordinary norm - conserving pseudopotentials only the first term in eq .",
    "[ vsic ] has to be considered .",
    "all the ingredients needed in eqs.[vsic ] are atomic quantities ( thus they are calculated during the initialization ) , except the occupation numbers , @xmath15 , which must be evaluated self - consistently by projecting the bloch state manifold onto the pseudoatomic basis :    @xmath18    @xmath19 . \\label{occ}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    again , the second term of eq . [ occ ] is only present for uspp .",
    "( the augmented charges @xmath20 are integrals of @xmath17 . )      for the calculation of the bec we employ the compact formulation developed by resta @xcite , which is based on the concept of position operator .",
    "this has the advantage of introducing electronic polarization and electron localization length as two quantities steaming from the same source .",
    "here we describe the formulation for spin - polarized systems and uspp which , to our knowledge , has not been presented previously .",
    "the source of the theory is the expectation value @xmath21 of the many - body phase operator :    @xmath22    here @xmath23 is the cartesian coordinate , @xmath24 the many - body position operator , @xmath25 the ground - state wavefunction , and @xmath26 a reciprocal - space vector of magnitude :    @xmath27 and m are length and number of unit cells ( that is number of grid points in reciprocal space ) in the @xmath23 direction , respectively .",
    "resta showed that the expected value of the position operator , within periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , must be calculated as :    @xmath28    where _",
    "g_@xmath29=2@xmath30/l@xmath29 , n is the number of electrons , and @xmath31 is the phase of @xmath21 . from eq .",
    "[ r_a ] the remarkable result follows that , within pbc , the electronic polarization p is :    @xmath32    on the same footing , the electron localization , @xmath33 , ( i.e. the spread of the single - particle position operator ) can be calculated from the absolute value of @xmath34 as :    @xmath35    although eqs.[pol ] and [ loc ] are valid for any system of interacting electrons , @xmath34 is in practice calculated within the usual independent - particle approximation .",
    "once the many - body wavefunction , @xmath25 , is expressed as a single slater determinant of bloch wavefunctions we have that,@xcite    @xmath36    where ,    @xmath37    these are the elements of a n@xmath38n@xmath39= ( n@xmath40m@xmath41)@xmath42 ( n@xmath40m@xmath41 ) matrix ( n@xmath39 and n@xmath40 are the number of spin - up electrons and occupied bands , respectively ) .",
    "it is easy to see that they are only non - vanishing for @xmath43 .",
    "thus the determinant in eq.[z_n2 ] can be decomposed into a product of m@xmath41 determinants ( i.e. one for each point of the reciprocal space grid ) of an n@xmath44n@xmath40-dimensional matrix :    @xmath45    where ,    @xmath46    a complication is caused by the use of uspp , since with the uspp method the bloch states are not orthonormal , thus the expected value of the phase operator must be augmented by an additional term which restores the contribution of the augmented atomic charges , q@xmath47 s .",
    "thus , the following contribution m@xmath48 should be added to the matrix @xmath49 given in eq.[det_s ] :    @xmath50    @xmath51    where @xmath52 are atomic positions .    the calculation of eqs .",
    "[ det_m ] , [ det_s ] , and [ aug ] is not demanding since the product over k - point space requires a dense grid only in the @xmath23-direction , whereas few k - points in the subspace orthogonal to @xmath23 are generally sufficient to obtain a well - converged result for electron polarization and localization length along direction @xmath23 .",
    "our local - spin density calculations@xcite are performed within a plane - wave basis set and employ ultrasoft pseudopotentials.@xcite for the lda calculations , ti ( 3s@xmath53),(3p@xmath54 ) semi - core electrons are included as valence charge in order to improve the transferability of their respective pseudopotentials .",
    "this is not necessary in pseudo - sic since these states are much lower in energy ( see ref . for a discussion about this point ) . in all cases we employ two beta functions for each angular channel",
    "also , non - linear core corrections have been used for all the atoms , and scalar - relativistic effects are included within the uspp for ca , ba , ti , and ge .",
    "we use cut - off energies equal to 30 ryd for camno@xmath1 and 40 ryd for all the other compounds . for the calculation of the berry phase , 6@xmath426",
    "special k - point grids are used for the integration in the plane orthogonal to the polarization direction , and up to 40 k - points to integrate along the parallel direction .      in this section we investigate two ferroelectric materials .",
    "batio@xmath1 is one of the simplest and best known ferroelectric perovskites , and the lda successfully describes the energetics of the three ferroelectric phase transitions ( tetragonal , orthorhombic and rhombohedral ) , provided that the experimental volumes are used for the calculations.@xcite the bec values are also well - established by a long series of lda calculations , and their large anomaly is assumed to be a major indication of ferroelectric instability .",
    "also , the lda calculations revealed that , despite the mainly ionic character of batio@xmath1 , some p - d hybridization is present , @xcite and the sensitivity of this hybridization to off - center atomic displacements is a fundamental force driving the system to the ferroelectric state.@xcite despite these successes , the comparison between the lda band - structure energies and the photoemission spectra@xcite show typical discrepancies that are worthy of investigation .    in figure [ batio_band ] ( left panel ) our calculated lda band energies of cubic batio@xmath1 at the lda volume are shown .",
    "the bands are well separated into groups , each with a single dominant orbital character . for the direct energy gap at @xmath0 we obtain the value 1.94 ev ( the absolute energy gap is indirect between r and @xmath0 points and equal to 1.84 ev ) , in agreement with other lda calculations,@xcite while , as usual ,",
    "the experiments indicate a much larger gap ( 3.2 ev@xcite ) . also , the spread of the o p manifold is @xmath55 4.5 ev , in contrast to an experimental value of 5.5 ev.@xcite",
    "finally , the binding energies of the more localized , lowest - lying states ( 9.9 ev for the ba 5p bands , 16.7 ev for the o 2s bands ) are underestimated with respect to the corresponding photoemission energies ( 12.2 ev and 18.8 ev )    we see in the right panel of figure [ batio_band ] that the pseudo - sic repairs the lda deficiencies to a large extent : the energy gap at @xmath0 is 3.13 ev , the bandwidth of the o p manifold is @xmath55 6 ev , and the energies of ba 5p and o 2s bands @xmath55 11.57 ev and 18 ev , respectively .    [ batio_band ]    there is a long - standing debate @xcite about the interpretation of the mismatch between the lda ( or lsda ) and the observed energy gap . briefly , if the mismatch is attributed to the lda inaccuracy , this may , in principle , affect any ground - state property . if otherwise the mismatch steams from a discontinuity of the exact energy functional ( i.e. it depends on the dft itself ) it has no consequences on the ground - state properties .",
    "in fact , both these aspects contribute to the mismatch . in the present case ,",
    "the agreement of pseudo - sic and experimental energy gap is an indication that the lda error is the dominant contribution .",
    ".born effective charges , z@xmath56 , and localization lengths , @xmath2 , ( in bohr ) calculated within lda and pseudo - sic for cubic batio@xmath1 . o@xmath57 and o@xmath58 label oxygens on - top of ti and planar with ti , respectively .",
    "[ tab_bec ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for nio we can repeat most of the considerations expressed for mno .",
    "now the energy gap in lsda lies in the minority d band manifold and is due to the crystal field splitting which is only @xmath55 1 ev .",
    "this value underestimates by far the experimental value .",
    "however , as in mno the p - d energy separation is @xmath55 4 ev and therefore no large anomalous charges contribute to the bec . from the up - spin and down - spin decomposition ( now @xmath59 = 10 ) we see that there is also a cancellation between the corresponding anomalies .",
    "the cancellation is almost complete within pseudo - sic , thus the bec is almost equal to the formal value .",
    "finally , within pseudo - sic we obtain a significant decrease of localization lengths for both these compounds with respect to the lsda .",
    "finally , we summarize the main findings of our analysis . we have seen that including strong - correlation effects within the band energy structure of strongly - correlated materials sensitively affects the values of the bec and the electron localization lengths . with respect to the lda or lsda results",
    ", the pseudo - sic systematically reduces both bec and @xmath2 for all the investigated materials .",
    "this effect is particularly evident for materials with highly anomalous bec ( i.e. batio@xmath1 and camno@xmath1 ) , and can be understood as resulting from the fact that the lsda overemphasizes the orbital hybridizations and therefore the electron hopping .",
    "the decrease of electron localization lengths is also expected since the sic enhances the binding energies and therefore the spatial localization of the electron charges . however , we point out that even within pseudo - sic the anomalous contribution to the bec is still substantial .",
    "our investigation reveals that the bec are controlled by two fundamental parameters : one is the the energy separation between the highest occupied anionic bands and the lowest empty cationic bands .",
    "this criterion explains the trend of the bec calculated for batio@xmath1 and camno@xmath1 ( where the separation is less than 2 ev in lsda and @xmath55 3 ev in pseudo - sic ) and the transition - metal mono - oxides , where it is @xmath55 4 ev in both lsda and pseudo - sic .",
    "the other important element is the metallic character of the system .",
    "it is very sound that in the metallic limit the bec must be divergent , and the electron localization length gives us the possibility of evaluating this limit quantitatively .",
    "gete is a perfect material for such an analysis , since it is a ferroelectric with highly anomalous bec and nearly metallic behavior .",
    "we found the gete energy gap small in both lda and pseudo - sic , but in pseudo - sic both the localization length and the bec are markedly smaller .",
    "finally , we should comment on the results of the two - band hubbard model calculations,@xcite since our results are in contrast with these works , which predict that the introduction of the on - site coulomb energy , u , should increase the bec with respect to a single - particle scheme , and the bec should undergo a sign change corresponding to the charge - transfer to mott - hubbard transition .",
    "the disagreement is due to the fact that in the hubbard model it is assumed that the on - site coulomb energy of the anion favors a ground state with mixed anion - cation occupancy , instead of a purely anionic ground state .",
    "this causes , at large u , the transition from the charge - transfer to the mott - hubbard regime , and also produces a sign change in the bec since now the anomalous current can flow from the filled cation to the empty anion .    in density fuctional calculations what happens is quite the opposite : with the on - site coulomb interaction on the ionic site turned on , a larger energy cost is associated with the fluctuation of the respective occupancy . the tendency to fluctuation",
    "is reduced by lowering ( not raising ) the energy of the filled anion bands .",
    "thus , strong correlation effects further favor charge - transfer ground states over mott - hubbard regimes .",
    "this is in complete agreement with the photoemission spectroscopy data@xcite for transition - metal and perovskite oxides , as well as with the lda+u results.@xcite in conclusion , we think that the two - band hubbard model is not adequate to describe materials like the ones studied in this paper , which present a complicated cohexistence of charge localization and hybridization .",
    "in this paper we revisited the behavior of the bec by means of our recently proposed pseudo - sic method which set the lsda density functional free of the spurious si , and thus describes the electronic properties of weakly as well as strongly correlated materials efficiently .",
    "we investigated two ferroelectric materials with highly anomalous bec , and some magnetic materials with both anomalous and non - anomalous bec .",
    "overall , we find that the anomalous part is systematically reduced ( but not suppressed ) by the sic . the electron localization lengths is also reduced by the sic , consistently with the idea that in the metallic limit the bec must be divergent .    on the basis of these considerations ,",
    "what can be argued about the bec s ability to predict a ferroelectric instability ? according to our results , there is no evidence to claim such a role for the bec , since their values are related to features of the band energy spectrum which are not specifically properties of a ferroelectric material .",
    "we may argue that a compound with large bec , if ferroeoectric , will have a large spontaneous polarization , since this represents the integrated value of the bec over the ferroelectric displacement,@xcite but the bec value in itself is not indicative of , or specific to a chemical environment particularly favorable for non - ferroelectric - to - ferroelectric phase transition .",
