    "the dispersive properties of capillary - gravity waves are responsible for the complicated wave pattern generated at the free surface of a still liquid by a disturbance moving with a velocity @xmath0 greater than the minimum phase speed @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the gravity , @xmath3 is the surface tension and @xmath4 the density of the fluid @xcite .",
    "the disturbance may be produced by a small object partially immersed in the liquid or by the application of an external surface pressure distribution @xcite .",
    "the waves generated by the moving perturbation propagate momentum to infinity and , consequently , the disturbance experiences a drag @xmath5 called the wave resistance @xcite . for @xmath6",
    "the wave resistance is equal to zero since , in this case , no propagating long - range waves are generated by the disturbance @xcite .",
    "a few years ago , it was predicted that the wave resistance corresponding to a surface pressure distribution symmetrical about a point should be discontinuous at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath8 is the the total vertical force exerted on the fluid surface , the wave resistance is expected to reach a finite value @xmath9 for @xmath10 . for an object much smaller than the capillary length @xmath11 , the discontinuity @xmath12 is given by :    @xmath13    experimentally",
    ", the onset of the wave - resistance due to the generation of capillary - gravity waves by a partially immersed moving object was studied recently by two independent groups @xcite . while browaeys _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite indeed find a discontinuous behaviour of the wave - resistance at @xmath7 in agreement with the theoretical predictions , burghelea _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite observe a smooth transition .",
    "the discrepancy between the theoretical analysis of @xcite and the experimental results of @xcite might be due to the fact that the experimental setup of burghelea _ et al .",
    "_ uses a feedback loop to keep the object at a constant depth while the analysis of @xcite assumes that the vertical component @xmath8 of the force exerted by the disturbance on the fluid does not depend on the velocity @xmath0 ( we might call such an analysis a  fixed force \" analysis ) . in order to check this proposition ,",
    "we perform in this letter a  fixed - depth \" calculation of the wave - drag close to the onset threshold .",
    "a somewhat similar analysis was performed in the large velocity limit by sun and keller @xcite .",
    "we will show that such a calculation indeed yields a cancellation of the vertical force at @xmath7 , that is to say , according to equation ( [ pgg ] ) , a smoothing of the discontinuity .     immersed at a depth @xmath14 .",
    "the velocity of the object is @xmath0 .",
    "we decompose the force exerted by the fluid on the object in a component orthogonal to the free surface ( @xmath8 ) and a component parallel to it ( @xmath15 ) . ]",
    "we take the @xmath16 plane as the equilibrium surface of the fluid .",
    "the immersed object exerts a stress at the fluid surface that can be considered equivalent to a pressure field @xmath17 @xcite that travels over the surface with a velocity @xmath0 in the @xmath18 direction .",
    "we assume @xmath19 ( the fourier transform of @xmath17 ) to be of the form :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in this case",
    ", @xmath19 is isotropic @xcite and @xmath8 is the total vertical force exerted on the fluid .    within the framework of rayleigh s linearized theory of capillary - gravity waves ,",
    "the fourier transform @xmath23 of the free surface displacement @xmath24 is related to the pressure field through @xcite :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the free dispersion relation , @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid .    let us suppose the object is located at the origin of the moving frame .",
    "if @xmath14 is its depth , the free surface displacement @xmath29 must be @xmath30 under the pinpoint ( here we suppose the object sufficiently hydrophobic and @xmath14 not to large so that the pinpoint does not pierce the surface ) .",
    "this leads to the following normalization condition :    @xmath31    the value of @xmath14 as a function of @xmath8 can be readily calculated using equations ( [ linearreponse ] ) and ( [ boundary ] ) :    @xmath32    with    @xmath33    finally , the drag - force @xmath34 is calculated by simply integrating the pressure force over the free surface @xcite .    @xmath35    this yields , using the explicit expression ( [ linearreponse ] ) for @xmath36 ,    @xmath37    with    @xmath38    according to equation ( [ formaldrag ] ) , the integral @xmath39 describes the fixed - force behaviour of the wave - resistance .",
    "due to the symmetry of @xmath40 , @xmath39 is parallel to @xmath41 and we shall henceforth set @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the unit vector parallel to the velocity of the object .",
    "the authors of @xcite studied the properties of @xmath44 in the case of a non - viscous fluid for which they showed that :    \\(a ) @xmath45 for @xmath6 ;    \\(b ) @xmath44 is discontinuous for @xmath10 , with    @xmath46    \\(c ) in the large velocity limit    @xmath47    in the case of a fixed depth analysis , @xmath8 becomes a function of @xmath0 .",
    "using equations ( [ formaldepth ] ) , we can rewrite the wave - resistance as    @xmath48    in general we have to rely on numerics to calculate the integrals @xmath49 and @xmath44 .",
    "typical results are presented on figure [ fig2 ] for an objet of size 0.1  mm immersed in water , and for a step - like function @xmath40 equal to 1 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 otherwise .",
    "we first observe on fig .",
    "( [ fig2]-a ) that @xmath49 increases sharply near the threshold .",
    "this leads to two rather different behaviours for @xmath44 and @xmath15 as shown on fig .",

    "( b ) comparison of @xmath53 ( dashed line ) and @xmath54 ( full line ) describing respectively the fixed - force and fixed - depth behaviour of the wave - resistance .",
    "we clearly see that contrary to the fixed - force analysis , the fixed - depth calculation does not yield any discontinuity at the threshold . here",
    "@xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . ]",
    "the characteristic features displayed by the plots of fig . [ fig2 ]",
    "can be captured by a zero - viscosity analysis . setting @xmath59 , equation ( [ normalize ] )",
    "can be simplified as :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 denotes the cauchy principal value of the integral .",
    "the integral is calculated in polar coordinates @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the angle of @xmath64 with respect to @xmath65 .",
    "introducing the function @xmath66 defined by :    @xmath67    where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the  mach \" number , equation ( [ visczero ] ) can then be rewritten as :    @xmath70    using the residue theorem @xcite , we get :    @xmath71    where @xmath72 the is the heaviside step - function .",
    "the variations of @xmath73 with @xmath74 are plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] : @xmath73 reaches its minimum value @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "it shows that equation @xmath77 has two solutions @xmath78 and @xmath79 , with @xmath80 , if @xmath0 is larger than the critical velocity @xmath81 , and none if @xmath6 .",
    "( see text ) with k. since @xmath73 reaches a minimum for @xmath76 with @xmath82 , equation @xmath83 presents solutions for @xmath84 . in this case",
    ", there are two possible values @xmath78 and @xmath79 with @xmath80 . ]    for @xmath85 , @xmath49 evaluates to    @xmath86 . \\label{integral}\\ ] ]    the above integrals can be calculated in the two limiting cases @xmath87 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath88 ) and @xmath89 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath90 ) .    for large @xmath91 ,",
    "the integrals are restricted to either large or small values of @xmath74 .",
    "if @xmath40 vanishes faster than @xmath92 for large @xmath74 , we can show that the small @xmath74 contribution dominates . in this region ,",
    "the dispersion relation is dominated by gravity waves , so that we can approximate @xmath73 by @xmath93 . a straightforward calculation",
    "then yields the following asymptotic expansion for @xmath49 :    @xmath94    combining this result with ( [ lambdalarge ] ) and [ formalfixeddepth ] , we get :    @xmath95    let s now focus on the case @xmath0 close to @xmath81 .",
    "we set :    @xmath96    and    @xmath97    using the fact that @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the roots of @xmath98 , we can rewrite @xmath99 as :    @xmath100    when @xmath101 , the @xmath102 term cancels in @xmath76 .",
    "since all other terms are regular , we can write at the leading order :    @xmath103    this latter integral is readily calculated and gets a very simple form in the limit @xmath104 :    @xmath105    since @xmath73 is invariant by the transformation @xmath106 , we see that @xmath107 and @xmath108 have the same asymptotic behaviour for @xmath104 . in this limit",
    "we have @xmath109 , hence :    @xmath110    in the case of an object of size @xmath111 , the width of @xmath40 is about @xmath112 . if we choose @xmath111 much smaller than the capillary length @xmath113 , we can approximate @xmath114 by @xmath22 . in this limit ,",
    "equation ( [ approxboundary ] ) takes the following form :    @xmath115    if we combine equations ( [ lambdathreshold ] ) and ( [ mainresult ] ) , we see that slightly above the threshold , the wave - resistance behaves like :    @xmath116    equation ( [ scaling ] ) constitutes the main result of this paper .",
    "first , we notice that for small objects this relation is , as expected , independent of the actual shape of the pressure field .",
    "second , and more important , it shows the wave resistance @xmath15 cancels out at @xmath7 .",
    "this smearing is due to the cancellation of the vertical force @xmath8 near the threshold that we get from the behaviour of @xmath49 .",
    "in this paper we have shown that in a fixed - depth situation the discontinuity of the drag - force calculated in @xcite vanishes and is replaced by a smooth variation , in accordance with the experimental results found in @xcite . a quantitative comparison between the present analysis and the data of ref .",
    "@xcite is however more involved since experiments from @xcite were performed in narrow channel geometry @xcite with objects of size comparable with the capillary length . to recover the scaling relation observed experimentally",
    ", it would also be necessary to take into account both the variations of the shape of @xmath40 with @xmath0 and the reflections of the waves on the walls of the channel .",
    "the present study suggests nevertheless that to fully test relation ( [ pgg ] ) , experiments need to be devised that would measure both @xmath15 and @xmath8 .                        not that this assumption is not entirely correct in the presence of viscosity since it leads to a slip of the object with respect to the fluid surface . in this case , a force field parallel to the free surface should be added to take into account the viscous drag .",
    "however , this new term leads to the well known stokes drag , that can substracted from experimental results , and so can be omitted in our analysis ."
