    "the spin 1/2 @xmath0-@xmath1 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on a square lattice has drawn great attention for the last two decades owing to its close relation to the disappearance of the antiferromagnetic ( af ) long range order ( lro ) in the high-@xmath7 superconducting materials  @xcite , and has been proposed as a possible simple model to realize topologically ordered chiral spin - liquid state  @xcite or @xmath8 spin - liquid state  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model is given by : @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the nearest neighbor ( nn ) pair and @xmath11 represents the next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) pair .",
    "for convenience , we set @xmath12 throughout the paper .",
    "it has long been believed that the frustration from nnn interaction competes with the nn one and drives the system through a quantum phase transition from an af lro phase to a magnetically disordered phase . in two extreme cases ,",
    "the ground state phases of the model are well established : at very small @xmath1 , the ground state has af lro ; and at very large @xmath1 , the system falls into two weakly coupled sets with magnetic susceptibility peaks at momentum @xmath13 or @xmath14 . in the intermediate coupling regime , quantum fluctuation",
    "is meant to destroy the af lro before the maximally frustrated point @xmath15 of the classical model and establishes a new paramagnetic phase .",
    "the nature of such a quantum phase is of great interest .",
    "numerous efforts have been made using many different approaches , such as the exact diagonalization ( ed )  @xcite , spin - wave theory  @xcite , series expansion  @xcite , large - n expansion  @xcite , the coupled cluster method ( ccm )  @xcite , variational methods ( including short range resonating valence bond ( srvb ) method )  @xcite , and the fixed - node quantum monte carlo ( qmc )  @xcite . especially , a series expansion calculation of a general magnetic susceptibility over different perturbation fields suggests that within the ginzburg - landau paradigm the type of phase transition from the nel to paramagnetic phase is of first order  @xcite .",
    "however , the same general magnetic susceptibility calculated with a coupled cluster method suggests a second order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "the debates about the phase near @xmath15 are more or less the same .",
    "a fixed - node qmc study indicates a plaquette valence bond solid ( pvbs ) state  @xcite ; whereas the series expansion argues for a columnar valence bond solid ( cvbs ) state  @xcite . a relatively direct investigation of the nature of the ground state order is using the srvb approximation  @xcite , where with another term @xmath16 included in the hamiltonian , a pvbs state along the line of @xmath17 is found .",
    "it is worth to mention that the recent tps studies have resolved a cvbs state  @xcite , but with rather small bond dimension .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit this problem with a tps  @xcite ansatz for the ground state wave function , accessed by the recently proposed cluster update algorithm  @xcite , and reveal the answer to both questions . up to @xmath18",
    ", we observe a continuous phase transition from the nel to paramagnetic phase at @xmath19 .",
    "we further investigate the nature of the paramagnetic phase by measuring various vbs order parameters . through finite size scaling ( fss ) , all considered vbs orders ( including cvbs , staggered vbs ( svbs ) and pvbs ) scale to zero , implying the possible emergence of spin - liquid state .",
    "the exponentially decaying spin - spin and dimer - dimer correlation functions found in the paramagnetic phase indicate the non - zero spin and magnon excitation gaps .",
    "moreover , we further verify the topologically ordered nature of such a spin - liquid phase by computing its constant part of renyi entanglement entropy .",
