    "phl  1092 ( @xmath0 ) is a radio  quiet quasar ( qso ) characterized in the optical band by outstanding fe  ii emission with a fe  ii@xmath44570  /  h@xmath5 ratio of @xmath1  5.3 ( bergeron & kunth 1980 ; bergeron & kunth 1984kwan et al 1995 ) .",
    "its line widths of @xmath1  1800  km  s@xmath6 and [ o  iii]@xmath45007  /  h@xmath5 ratio of @xmath1  0.9 classify phl  1092 as a high  luminosity representative of the narrow  line seyfert  1 ( nls1 ) galaxy population ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 ; goodrich 1989 ) .",
    "in fact , strong fe  ii emission seems to be a further characteristics of the optical spectra of nls1 galaxies ( e.g. vron - cetty , vron & gonalves 2001 ) .",
    "nls1 galaxies also exhibit remarkable properties in the x  ray regime .",
    "they are characterized by large  amplitude short  timescale x  ray variability and their x  ray spectra are steeper than in broad  line sources ( e.g. boller , brandt & fink 1996 ; brandt , mathur & elvis 1997 ; leighly 1999a , b ) .",
    "this is more dramatic in the soft x ",
    "ray band , where a prominent soft excess of debated origin is very often observed .",
    "a number of nls1 are x  ray weak if compared to optically  selected standard qso and their x  ray variability is generally larger than in the optical / uv producing changes in the optical to x  ray spectral slope @xmath2 up to @xmath7 ( e.g. ngc  4051 , 1h  0707495 , see gallo 2006 ) .",
    "phl  1092 is one of the most x  ray variable nls1 known , despite its qso  like x  ray and optical luminosities ( see also the remarkable case of iras  132243809 , boller et al .",
    "1997 ) . during the 1997 rosat monitoring of phl  1092 , a maximum variability amplitude of a factor @xmath1  14 was reported ( brandt et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the typical luminosity in the 0.2 - 2  kev band is @xmath8  erg  s@xmath6 .",
    "phl  1092 was observed with",
    "newton _ on three occasions .",
    "the first observation was performed on 2000 july 31 and lasted @xmath1  32  ks .",
    "the odf files for the epic cameras could not be recovered , but x  ray and uv light curves from the rgs and optical monitor ( om ) could be obtained ( gallo et al .",
    "the source was then re  observed three years later on 2003 july 18 for @xmath1  29  ks , resulting in complete set of odf files for all detectors .",
    "finally , we obtained a further @xmath1  60  ks observation on 2008 january 20 which is the main subject of this letter .",
    "besides the simultaneous uv observations with the om , we also obtained quasi ",
    "simultaneous optical spectra at the hobby ",
    "eberly telescope ( het , 600  s on 2008 january 30 ) and at the william herschel telescope ( wht , 900  s on 2008 february 14 ) .",
    "the most striking result of our new 2008 _ xmm  newton _ observation is that phl  1092 is much fainter than during any previous x ",
    "ray observation .",
    "this is readily visible by examining x  ray images of the region . in fig .",
    "[ images ] we show the epic pn images from the two available good quality _ xmm  newton",
    "_ observations clearly showing that a dramatic variability event has taken place , so that phl  1092 is not even the brightest x  ray source in the region in 2008 .",
    "the 0.52  kev flux of phl  1092 from all previous available x  ray observations is shown in fig .",
    "[ lchist ] . as will be discussed below , the flux drop between the latest _",

    "[ srcback ] , we compare the 2008 epic pn source plus background spectrum of phl  1092 with the background itself .",
    "phl  1092 is well detected above the background level up to @xmath1  0.9  kev only .",
    "hence we here focus on the 0.2 - 0.9  kev range only , corresponding to the @xmath10.281.26  kev band in the rest  frame . given that the main interest of our work is to assess the long  term x  ray variability of phl  1092 , we proceed by analysing the new 2008 data together with the earlier 2003 _ xmm  newton _ observation , which represents a typical x  ray flux state of the source ( see fig .  [ lchist ] . )      in fig .",
    "[ speccomp ] we show the epic  pn spectrum from the 2008 observation together with the 2003 data ( above @xmath17  kev the background dominates during the 2003 observation ) . in order to compare the source fluxes during the 2003 and 2008",
    "_ xmm  newton _ observations in more detail , we apply the same spectral model to the two data sets , and we first adopt a simple power law model absorbed by a column of neutral gas which we allow to vary in the range of the measured galactic value ( @xmath11  @xmath10 , murphy et al . 1996 )    the 2008 data are well described ( @xmath12 for 23 degrees of freedom , dof ) by a very steep but loosely constrained photon index @xmath13 .",
    "we measure a flux of @xmath14  erg  @xmath10  s@xmath6 in the 0.20.9  kev band , corresponding to a 0.20.9  kev unabsorbed luminosity of @xmath15  erg  s@xmath6 .",
    "the 2003 data are only relatively well described ( @xmath16 for 130 dof ) , but we can nonetheless obtain a good measure of the spectral shape with @xmath17 with a 0.20.9  kev flux of @xmath18  erg  @xmath10  s@xmath6 , corresponding to an unabsorbed luminosity of @xmath19  erg  s@xmath6 in the same energy range .",
    "given that the 0.20.9  kev spectral shape is consistent with being the same in the 2003 and 2008 observations , we then consider a joint fit to the two data sets ( in the 0.24  kev range for the 2003 observation to avoid the high  energy complexities discussed by gallo et al 2004 , and in the 0.20.9  kev range for the 2008 one ) .",
    "we use the simplest best  fitting model for the higher flux 2003 spectrum , comprising a phenomenological disc blackbody ( bb ) model plus a power law , modified by neutral absorption fixing all parameters to be the same except for an overall normalization .",
    "we obtain an acceptable joint fit ( @xmath20 for 202 dof ) with kt@xmath1  100  ev , @xmath21 and n@xmath22  @xmath10 ( less than the galactic value ) .",
    "if the column density is allowed to vary between the two observations , no significant improvement is obtained and the 2008 data are inconsistent with n@xmath23  @xmath10 .",
    "the bb temperatures are also consistent with each other . by using the common spectral model , we infer that the flux drop during the 2008 pointing with respect to the previous one is of a factor @xmath24 .",
    "if the low flux state is compared with the historical one shown in fig .",
    "[ lchist ] , the drop is of a factor @xmath25 .",
    "incidentally , if the two flux states are indeed associated with the same spectral component in the soft band , our result implies that interpreting the soft x ",
    "ray excess in nls1 galaxies as bb emission is implausible as the luminosity drop occurs here at fixed temperature without following the standard bb  defining @xmath26 relationship .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ srcback ] , the hard x  rays during the 2008 observation are background  dominated .",
    "a simple power law fit to the 210  kev data is however useful to set a 210 flux upper limit of @xmath27  erg  s@xmath6  @xmath10 for future reference .      in fig .",
    "[ lccomp ] we show the epic pn lightcurve of phl  1092 in the 0.20.9  kev band .",
    "no short  timescale variability is significantly detected in the whole @xmath1  60  ks light curve , while variability of 50 per cent or more is normally observed on similar timescales ( see e.g. brandt et al .",
    "1999 ; gallo et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the lack of x  ray variability could in principle indicate that a different spectral component is responsible for the 2008 spectrum .",
    "it is for instance possible that soft x ",
    "rays are associated with a large  scale scattered / reprocessed component , overwhelmed by the nuclear continuum emission in normal flux states .",
    "a rich spectrum of soft x ",
    "ray emission lines is indeed observed in obscured seyfert  2 ( see e.g. guainazzi & bianchi 2007 ) and in unobscured seyfert  1 galaxies when observed at very low x  ray flux levels ( e.g. ngc 4051 , pounds et al .",
    "2004 , ponti et al . 2006 ; mrk 335 , grupe et al . 2008a ; longinotti et al .",
    "this gas is likely associated with the narrow line region ( bianchi , guainazzi & chiaberge 2006 ) thus responding to continuum variation on very long timescales , and it typically represents a few per cent of the soft 0.52  kev nuclear flux ( bianchi & guainazzi 2007 ) . in phl  1092 , the soft x ",
    "ray flux ( or luminosity ) observed in 2008 is about 0.7 per cent of the historical , which means that a scattering / reprocessing interpretation is viable provided that the average flux of phl  1092 in the past few hundreds years ( assuming a size of few hundreds parsecs for the reprocessing medium ) was a factor of a few smaller than that we observed over the past 30 years .",
    "it should however be stressed that in all cases for which sufficiently high quality data can be collected , accreting black holes satisfy the so  called linear rms  flux relationship on all timescales ( uttley & mchardy 2001 ) .",
    "this means that sources in low flux states are much less likely to exhibit large amplitude variability than at higher flux levels .",
    "thus the apparent lack of x  ray variability is not necessarily related to some physical difference in the x  ray emission , but could simply be an extension to low flux levels of the variability properties of the source .",
    "all three _ xmm  newton _ observations provide data from the om .",
    "in particular , exposures are available in the uvw2 filter ( effective wavelength of @xmath11480    in the rest  frame ) .",
    "the om data for the 2000 and 2003 observations were analysed by gallo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who report an average uvw2 flux of @xmath28erg  s@xmath6  @xmath10  @xmath6  in 2000 and of @xmath29erg  s@xmath6  @xmath10  @xmath6  in 2003 .",
    "moreover , gallo et al . (",
    "2004 ) also claim tentative evidence for uv short  timescale variability of the order of few per cent , especially during the 2003 observation . during our deep minimum 2008 observation ,",
    "the uv flux is @xmath30erg  s@xmath6  @xmath10  @xmath6  , i.e. consistent with the 2003 flux .",
    "the uv light curve ( not shown here , 20 exposures of @xmath1  2700  s each in uvw2 ) is consistent with a constant ( @xmath31 ) as is the x  ray lightcurve ( see fig .  [ lccomp ] ) .",
    "[ optical ]    our uv flux measurement implies that the phl  1092 spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is now characterized by a much steeper optical to x  ray spectral slope @xmath2 , defined as the hypothetical power law slope between the 2500     and 2  kev rest ",
    "frame flux densities , than in 2003 .",
    "a @xmath32 slope from the simultaneous 2003 uv and x  ray data was computed by gallo ( 2006 ) . by applying the well known relationship between @xmath2 and the 2500    luminosity @xmath33 ( e.g. steffen et al .",
    "2006 ; see also vignali , brandt & schneider 2003 , strateva et al 2005 ; gibson , brandt & schneider 2008 ) , we infer that phl  1092 should have @xmath34 .",
    "the 2003 value ( @xmath31.56 ) is consistent with the spread in the relationship for objects with @xmath35 ( steffen et al .",
    "2006 ) , while in 2008 we measure @xmath36 , well outside the @xmath37 spread .",
    "following gibson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) we define @xmath38 as the difference between the observed @xmath2 and the one that can be predicted from the optical luminosity . while @xmath39 is quite typical for optically  selected qso , the 2008 value is @xmath40 , so extreme that much less than 1 per cent of optically  selected qso with no broad absorption line ( bal ) systems are expected to share with phl  1092 such x  ray weakness ( gibson et al . 2008 ) .",
    "quasi  simultaneous optical spectra were also obtained at the het ( low  resolution spectrograph , lrs ) and wht ( intermediate dispersion spectrograph and imaging system , isis ) , 10 and 25 days respectively after the _ xmm  newton _ observation .",
    "it is not the purpose of this letter to present detailed optical spectroscopy , but only to check whether , given the huge x ",
    "ray flux variation , a corresponding dramatic change in the optical properties of the source has occurred . the het spectrum ( @xmath131005250  in the rest  frame ) is shown in fig  6 ( top ) .",
    "it is dominated by optical and uv fe  ii lines with relatively weak h@xmath5 and [ o  iii ] , and does not show any striking deviation from the one presented by bergeron & kunth ( 1980 ) .",
    "the same is true for the wht spectrum which extends down to mg  ii and up to @xmath16500  ( rest  frame ) the observed wavelength range .",
    "we do not have coverage of the c  iv region which would be interesting to search for the appearance of a bal signature in phl  1092 ( brandt , laor & wills 2000 ) .",
    "we show however the mg  ii@xmath42798   region , which does not show the developing of any low  ionization bal ( fig .  6 , bottom ) .",
    "we conclude that no dramatic change in the optical properties of the source has shown up on timescales of tens of days after the observed extreme x  ray flux drop of phl  1092 .",
    "the major result of our _ xmm  newton _ observation of phl  1092 is the discovery of a dramatic x  ray flux drop with respect to any previous observation , together with a persistent constant uv flux .",
    "this produces a very significant steepening of @xmath2 from @xmath41 to @xmath42 in just @xmath1  4.5 years .",
    "the x  ray weakness during 2008 is such that the @xmath2 deviation from a normal optically  selected qso with the same 2500    luminosity is one of the largest observed so far for non  bal qso ( @xmath43 ) .    a similar case in terms of extreme x  ray weakness is that of phl  1811 ( @xmath44 ; leighly et al .",
    "2007a , b ; see also lbqs  0102 - 2713 for which boller et al .",
    "2009 report @xmath45 ) .",
    "both phl  1092 and phl  1811 represent the high  luminosity end of the nls1 population ( with phl  1811 being about 5 times more optically luminous than phl  1092 ) .",
    "moreover , they both have strong feii emission , relatively weak [  oiii  ] and unusually blue far  uv spectra , while lacking strong ly@xmath46 and civ lines ( leighly et al .",
    "2007a , b ) . however ,",
    "phl  1811 has always been observed to be x  ray weak over the past @xmath120 years ( in 7 different observations ) while , for a comparable number of x  ray observations and monitoring period , phl  1092 has been observed to be extremely x  ray weak only once .",
    "our 2008 observation of phl  1092 implies that transitions from relatively standard qso states ( in terms of @xmath2 ) to extreme x  ray weak ones are possible on relatively short timescales ( few years ) .",
    "this in turns means that outliers in the @xmath37 relation may be due to transient extreme x  ray variability phenomena and that they may change their status if sufficiently long monitoring is performed .    despite the factor of @xmath47",
    "x  ray flux drop of phl  1092 , the persistent soft spectral shape , combined with the non  detection of ( simple ) intrinsic x  ray absorption , may suggest that an absorption event is unlikely .",
    "however , as discussed in section  3.2 , the nature of the soft x ",
    "ray emission in the 2008 observation of phl  1092 is uncertain ( either direct nuclear emission or large  scale scattered / reprocessed emission ) .",
    "if x  rays are scattered , the nuclear emission could be absorbed by e.g. compton  thick matter .",
    "if so , the persistent uv flux in phl  1092 means that the absorber would have to completely stop x",
    " rays ( e.g. being compton ",
    "thick ) while being transparent in the uv regime , which seems highly unlikely given that the the uv and x  ray emission regions ( accretion disc and x  ray corona , respectively in the standard view ) most likely share similar locations .",
    "even by considering unusual absorber size and covering factor or non  standard physical properties ( ionization state , grain size distribution ) it seems difficult that uv and optical would be unaffected .",
    "one possibility would be that the uv are also scattered so that they are spatially separated from the x  ray emitting region .",
    "however , tentative evidence for short timescale uv variability during the 2003 ( gallo et al . 2004 ) argues against such a hypothesis .",
    "a partial covering scenario has been invoked to account for the x  ray weakness of some other nls1 galaxies ( e.g. mrk  335 , grupe et al . 2008a ; wpvs  007 , grupe , leighly , komossa 2008b ) . however ,",
    "uv variability was always observed , as opposed to the present case .",
    "another possible scenario is one in which the direct nuclear emission is suppressed by light  bending effects near the black hole ( miniutti & fabian 2004 ; fabian et al .",
    "light bending can be responsible for a maximum x  ray variability of a factor @xmath48 , and the remaining factor @xmath49 should have to be accounted for by intrinsic variability .",
    "this is more acceptable especially for nls1 sources , but we consider somewhat unlikely that both effects conspire to act simultaneously and in the same direction",
    ".    generally speaking , the uv to x  ray spectral energy distribution of agn is interpreted in terms of accretion disc emission ( peaking in the uv ) and inverse compton by one or more population of hot electrons ( the so  called x ",
    "ray corona ) upscattering the soft uv seed photons up to x  ray energies . since the uv flux remains constant between the 2003 and 2008 observations , if we exclude an absorption origin for the sudden x ",
    "ray weakness of phl  1092 , we must conclude that the ability of the x  ray corona to upscatter the optical / uv seed photons through inverse compton was very significantly reduced during the 2008 observation ( see grupe et al .",
    "2000 for a similar explanation in the case of the radio ",
    "loud nls1 galaxy rx  j0134.24258 ) . in order to get insights on the plausibility of genuine x  ray coronal variability in phl  1092",
    ", it may be useful to compare the behaviour of phl  1092 with that of galactic black hole binaries .",
    "the much smaller size of these systems allows one to probe timescales that are not accessible for agn , thus providing potential clues to agn studies . by making use of the analogy between the agn and galactic black hole sed , the question here would be to consider whether galactic sources can exhibit large amplitude variability events in the x  ray corona component ( power law ) while the soft x  ray disc component is stable .",
    "in a recent work sobolewska , gierlinski & siemiginowska ( 2009 ) introduced a @xmath50 parameter defined as the equivalent of @xmath2 for galactic black hole binaries , i.e. the quantity measuring the spectral slope between the disc and corona  dominated components .",
    "they show that @xmath51 of the order of unity can be reached by a single source at a given disc luminosity during a given outburst .",
    "the observed timescale for such variations is of the order of days .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , no firm constraints can be placed on the shortest possible timescales , making it possible ( though most probably very rare ) that variability of this amplitude could be seen in agn on timescales of years . a small mass for the black hole in phl  1092 would help to reduce its variability timescale . in fact ,",
    "while its optical luminosity would suggest a black hole mass of the order of @xmath52 ( dasgupta , rao & dewangan 2004 ) , x  ray variability suggests instead a much smaller mass of @xmath53 ( bian & zhao 2003 ; nikolajuk , czerny & gurynowicz 2009 ) .",
    "although extrinsic explanations such as absorption or light bending can not be firmly ruled out , we conclude that we have likely observed a rare and extreme variability event associated with a transient dramatic weakening or disruption of the x  ray corona in phl  1092 .",
    "future x  ray and optical / uv monitoring of the source is mandatory to reveal the nature of the extreme event we have reported here .",
