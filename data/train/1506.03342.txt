    "one hundred years ago , albert einstein published his general theory of relativity ( general relativity or gr ) , which describes gravity as the warping of space and time due to the presence of matter and energy , and forever changed our conceptual understanding of one of nature s fundamental forces . prior to gr ,",
    "isaac newton s theory of gravitation , which describes gravity as the force of one massive object on another , reigned supreme and unchallenged for nearly a quarter of a millennium . with the advent of gr , newtonian gravitation was reduced to that of an approximation to a more fundamental underlying theory of nature and must be abandoned altogether when probing phenomena near highly relativistic objects such as black holes and neutron stars .",
    "nevertheless , newtonian gravitation is highly successful in accounting for the approximate motion of the planets in our solar system and allows for a theoretical derivation of kepler s three empirical laws .    according to newtonian gravitation ( and",
    "kepler s first law of planetary motion ) the planets move in _ closed _ elliptical orbits with the sun residing at one focus.@xcite for these orbits , the translating body finds itself at precisely the same radial distance after the polar angle has advanced by @xmath0 and will therefore retrace its preceding elliptical motion indefinitely .",
    "this newtonian prediction of closed elliptical orbits holds true only in the absence of other massive objects as additional orbiting bodies generate perturbations to the motion . additionally , when the theoretical framework of gr is employed , the closed or _",
    "stationary _ elliptical orbits of newtonian gravitation are replaced with elliptical - like orbits whose perihelia and aphelia _ precess _ , even in the absence of additional massive objects.@xcite before einstein s gr , the small but observable precession of mercury s perihelion was partially unaccounted for and offered the first real test of general relativity .",
    "in fact , when the precession of earth s equinoxes and the gravitational effects of the other planets tugging on mercury are accounted for , gr claims exactly the additional measured precession .",
    "the predicted value of mercury s perihelion precession due to general relativistic effects is incredibly tiny , equating to an angular shift per orbit of less than one part in ten million .    according to general relativity",
    ", a massive object causes the spacetime in its vicinity to warp or curve simply due to its presence .",
    "hence , the planets move in their respective orbits not due to the gravitational force of the sun acting on them , but rather due to the fact that the planets are moving in the warped four - dimensional spacetime about the sun .",
    "in a typical introductory undergraduate gr course , the spacetime external to a non - rotating , spherically symmetric massive object is often extensively studied as it offers a simple , exact solution to the field equations of general relativity . to gain conceptual insight into this non - euclidean spacetime , an embedding diagram is often constructed . by examining the spacetime geometry external to the massive object at one moment in time , with the spherical polar angle set to @xmath1 , a two dimensional ( 2d ) equatorial",
    " slice \" of the three dimensional space is extracted .",
    "a curved two dimensional , cylindrically symmetric surface embedded in a flat three dimensional space is then constructed with the same spatial geometry as this two dimensional spacetime slice ; this is the embedding diagram .",
    "these embedding diagrams prove incredibly useful in visualizing spacetime curvature and serve as a conceptual tool .",
    "when free particle orbits , or geodesics , about non - rotating , spherically symmetric massive object are then later studied , a conceptual analogy of a marble rolling on a warped two - dimensional surface is often drawn to represent the orbital motion .",
    "although this analogy may be useful for the beginning student of gr in visualizing particle orbits about massive objects in curved spacetime , it is nt precise and fundamentally differs from the analogy of embedding diagrams discussed above .",
    "although the function that describes the shape of the cylindrically symmetric surface of the embedding diagram is of a relatively simple form , there exists no 2d cylindrically symmetric surface residing in a uniform gravitational field that can generate the exact newtonian orbits of planetary motion , save the special case of circular orbits.@xcite this null result holds when considering a fully general relativistic treatment of orbital motion about a non - rotating spherically symmetric massive object.@xcite for an object rolling or sliding on the interior of an inverted cone with a slope of @xmath2 , it has been shown that the stationary elliptical orbits of planetary motion can occur when the orbits are nearly circular.@xcite later , elliptical - like orbits with small eccentricities were considered on 2d cylindrically symmetric surfaces where a perturbative solution was constructed.@xcite there it was found that when the surface s shape takes the form of a power law , precessing elliptical - like orbits with small eccentricities can only occur for certain powers and stationary elliptical orbits with small eccentricities can only occur for certain powers and for certain radii on the surface .",
    "although we show that no such surface exists that can _ exactly _ reproduce the arbitrary bound orbits of a spherically - symmetric potential , cylindrically symmetric surfaces _ do _ exist that yield the stationary and precessing elliptical - like orbits with small eccentricities of newtonian gravitation and general relativity , respectively .",
    "first , we arrive at a general expression describing the slope of a 2d cylindrically symmetric surface that yields the elliptical orbits of newtonian gravitation for small eccentricities .",
    "the slope of this surface reduces to the special case of white s when the arbitrary constant of integration is set equal to zero.@xcite we then extend our study to general relativity and arrive at an expression for the slope of a 2d surface that generates the precessing elliptical orbits of gr for small eccentricities . for the sake of brevity",
    "we symbolically represent _ stationary elliptical - like orbits of newtonian gravitation with small eccentricities _ as n@xmath3 orbits and _ precessing elliptical - like orbits of general relativity with small eccentricities _ as gr@xmath3 orbits ; these phrases appear frequently throughout the paper and warrant this use of shorthand .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ng ] , we derive the equations of motion for an object orbiting in a generic spherically symmetric potential .",
    "we examine the case of newtonian gravitation and present the solution for the respective particle orbits while introducing the notation contained in the sections that follow . in sec .",
    "[ elliptical - like ] , we consider the rolling or sliding motion of an object constrained to reside on a 2d cylindrically symmetric surface and obtain the corresponding orbital equation of motion . we show that this equation is fundamentally different than the equation of motion for an object subjected to a generic 3d spherically symmetric potential and that there exists no 2d cylindrically symmetric surface that can make these equations coincide for any spherically symmetric potential , except for the special case of circular orbits .",
    "for elliptical - like orbits with small eccentricities on the cylindrically symmetric surface , we solve the orbital equation of motion perturbatively .",
    "a differential equation , evaluated at the characteristic radius of the orbital motion , emerges and relates the precession parameter of the orbit to the slope of the respective surface . by demanding that the elliptical - like orbits on the surface have a constant precession parameter and by relaxing the condition that the aforementioned differential equation be evaluated at the characteristic radius of the motion , we solve the corresponding differential equation and find the slope of the surface that yields these elliptical - like orbits with small eccentricities for all radii on the surface .",
    "we then examine the solution for the slope that generates the n@xmath3 orbits . in sec .",
    "[ gr ] , we extend our study to general relativity . by demanding that the elliptical - like orbits on the 2d surface now mimic those of gr , we present the slope of the surface that yields these gr@xmath3 orbits for all radii on the surface .",
    "we then compare these two families of surfaces with the intent of offering insight into the aforementioned theories of gravitation .",
    "we begin this manuscript with a review of central - force motion and , in particular , of newtonian gravitation .",
    "this treatment is not only instructive but also serves to introduce the notation contained within the sections that follow .",
    "the lagrangian describing an orbiting body of mass @xmath4 in a generic spherically symmetric potential is of the form [ lagrangiangen ] l = m - u(r ) , where @xmath5 are spherical polar coordinates and a dot indicates a time - derivative . as the angular momentum of an orbiting body in a spherically symmetric potential is conserved , the motion of the object , without loss of generality , can be chosen to reside in the equatorial plane .",
    "this is done by setting @xmath6 in eq . where the lagrangian reduces to one dependent only on the two plane polar coordinates @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is noted that conservation of angular momentum is a general result of central - force motion and , for the case of planetary motion in newtonian gravitation , equates to kepler s second law.@xcite    the lagrangian of eq . generates two equations of motion , which take the form -+&=&0[teq ] + & = & , [ angmom ] where @xmath9 is a constant of the motion and equates to the conserved angular momentum per unit mass .",
    "here we are interested in arriving at an expression for the radial distance of the orbiting body in terms of the azimuthal angle , @xmath10 . using the chain rule and eq .",
    "( [ angmom ] ) , a differential operator of the form [ oper ] = can be constructed and used to transform eq . into the form [ phieq ] -()^2-r+=0 .",
    "equation is the equation of motion describing the radial distance of an orbiting body as a function of the azimuthal angle in a generic spherically symmetric potential .",
    "this equation will later be compared to the equation of motion for an object rolling or sliding on a cylindrically symmetric 2d surface .    for an object of mass @xmath4 residing in a newtonian gravitational potential , the general expression of eq .",
    "takes the form [ phinew ] -()^2-r+r^2=0 , where @xmath11 is newton s constant and @xmath12 is the mass of the central object .",
    "equation is usually presented in a slightly simpler form in most classical dynamics texts by adopting a change of variables of the form @xmath13 .",
    "this substitution is unnecessary in the present treatment and will thus be avoided .",
    "it is noted that eqs . and are technically the equations of motion for the reduced mass @xmath14 of the equivalent one - body problem , but approximately describe the motion of the particle of mass @xmath4 in the limit that @xmath15.@xcite in this limit , we can neglect the motion of the central mass @xmath12 treating it as fixed , which is exactly the regime this manuscript is interested in understanding .",
    "equation can be solved _",
    "exactly _ and yields the well - known conic sections of the form [ rext ] r()= , where @xmath16 is a constant , known historically as the semilatus rectum , and @xmath3 is the eccentricity of the orbit . notice that for the eccentricity , @xmath17 corresponds to the special case of circular motion whereas @xmath18 describes elliptical orbits . also notice that eq .",

    "notice that when eq .",
    "is taken as the solution for the radius , @xmath16 corresponds to the average radius of an elliptical orbit with small eccentricity to first - order in the eccentricity .",
    "the eccentricities of the planets of our solar system are quite small with an average eccentricity of @xmath20 , hence eq .",
    "yields an excellent approximation for the radii of the orbits . as a specific example",
    ", mercury has the largest of eccentricities with a value of @xmath21 . comparing the exact and approximate radii given by eqs . and",
    "respectively , we find a maximum percent error of @xmath22@xcite see table [ tab : beta ] near the end of this article for the eccentricities of the solar system planets .",
    "the lagrangian describing a body of mass @xmath4 residing on a cylindrically symmetric surface in a uniform gravitational field is of the form [ lagrangian ] l = m+i^2-mgz , where we have included both the translational and rotational kinetic energy of the orbiting body and the gravitational potential energy of the object at a height @xmath23 . in an earlier version of this manuscript ,",
    "the rolling and sliding motions of an orbiting body were collectively analyzed and presented . in the analysis the rolling object",
    "was assumed to roll without slipping and the approximation that the angular velocity of a rolling object is proportional to the translational velocity of the object s center of mass was adopted .",
    "there it was found that the general solution for the slope of the surface , which will be presented later in this section , does not depend on the intrinsic spin of the orbiting body .",
    "in fact , none of the results presented in this manuscript depend on the intrinsic spin of the orbiting body . with the benefit of hindsight and for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we forego this more detailed analysis as the results are left unaltered and set the rotational kinetic energy term of eq . to zero .",
    "as we are interested in studying the motion of an orbiting body on a cylindrically symmetric surface , we note that there exists an equation of constraint connecting two of the three cylindrical coordinates generically of the form @xmath24 . using this fact and setting the rotational kinetic energy term to zero , eq .",
    "can be massaged into the form [ lagrangian2 ] l = m - mgz(r ) , where @xmath25 and we used the fact that @xmath26 via the chain rule .",

    "likewise , there exists no cylindrically symmetric surface , described by @xmath29 , that can generate a term capable of canceling the @xmath30 term in eq . as derivatives of @xmath29 are likewise strictly functions of @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath30 term of eq . arises from motion in the @xmath23-direction on the cylindrically symmetric surface where @xmath31 . hence , eqs . and can not be made to match for any spherically symmetric potential , @xmath27 , or for any 2d cylindrically symmetric surface , @xmath29 , except for the trivial case of @xmath32 .",
    "this disparity implies that there exists _ no _ cylindrically symmetric surface residing in a uniform gravitational field that is capable of reproducing the exact motion of a body orbiting in _ any _ spherically symmetric potential @xmath33 , except for the special case of circular motion .",
    "this null result was first pointed out for an orbiting object subjected to the newtonian gravitational potential of a central mass and later for the case of a body orbiting about a non - rotating , spherically symmetric massive object in general relativity.@xcite for the special case of circular motion , a 2d cylindrically symmetric surface can yield the orbits of newtonian gravitation , taken here to mean that the surface yields orbits that obey kepler s three laws , when the shape of the surface takes the form of a @xmath34 newtonian gravitation potential well .",
