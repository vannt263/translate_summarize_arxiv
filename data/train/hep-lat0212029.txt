    "qcd exhibits two remarkable features , confinement and chiral symmetry breaking , which both are cornerstones for our understanding of strongly interacting particles .",
    "it is an interesting property of qcd that at the qcd phase transition the restoration of chiral symmetry and the disappearance of confinement occur at the same critical temperature .",
    "this seems to indicate that the two phenomena are intimately linked with each other .",
    "so far the two phenomena have resisted our attempts to find a description unifying them and the structure of the fundamental excitations of the qcd vacuum is still unclear .    in recent years",
    "lattice calculations have started to contribute to our understanding of the qcd vacuum fluctuations .",
    "in particular it was found that the eigenmodes of the dirac operator provide a powerful filter removing the hard uv fluctuations and only the long range modes couple to the low eigenvectors @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these studies were inspired by the phenomenological picture of chiral symmetry breaking based on instantons @xcite . in this picture the qcd vacuum is described as a fluid of interacting instantons and anti - instantons . instead of a zero - mode which exists for a single instanton @xcite the fluid of interacting instantons and anti",
    "- instantons gives rise to many near zero - modes which have small but non - zero eigenvalues .",
    "the density of these eigenvalues is then related to the chiral condensate by the banks - casher formula @xcite .",
    "lattice studies have established that the near zero - modes do indeed show a lumpy structure and are locally chiral as expected from the instanton picture .",
    "furthermore it was demonstrated that the lumps in the field strength have a high degree of self - duality @xcite .",
    "note however , that first attempts to fit eigenmodes of the dirac operator with the profile of the t hooft zero - mode have failed @xcite .    in this article",
    "we use a new method for probing the qcd vacuum with eigenvectors of the lattice dirac operator .",
    "we introduce an arbitrary phase @xmath2 with @xmath3 $ ] at the temporal boundary of the dirac operator and analyze how the zero - mode in configurations with topological charge @xmath4 responds to changes in @xmath5 .",
    "the most prominent feature we discover is that the zero - mode changes its position and can be located at different space - time points for different values of @xmath5 .",
    "this property is observed for quenched ensembles of su(3 ) gauge configurations with temperature , both in the confined and the deconfined phase as well as for configurations on a torus .",
    "our generalized boundary condition is motivated by an interesting property of zero - modes for kraan - van baal ( kvb ) solutions of the classical yang - mills equations on a euclidean cylinder .",
    "kvb solutions @xcite generalize the caloron solution @xcite by allowing for non - trivial polyakov loop at spatial infinity .",
    "kvb solutions depend in addition to the phases of the polyakov loop at spatial infinity also on @xmath6 ( for su(@xmath6 ) ) vectors @xmath7 .",
    "when one draws apart those vectors one finds that an object of charge 1 is built from @xmath6 constituent monopoles and this property might lead to the missing link between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "strong evidence for su(2 ) kvb solutions in cooled lattice gauge configurations were given for twisted @xcite and periodic boundary conditions @xcite .    for kvb solutions",
    "also the zero - mode has been computed @xcite .",
    "this zero - mode has the remarkable property that it is located on only one of the constituent monopoles but it can jump from one monopole to another when changing @xmath5 . in a previous article",
    "@xcite we have compared zero - modes with periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions and have found clear signals for kvb - type behavior . here",
    "we now use the generalized boundary condition with phase @xmath2 and present further strong evidence that the excitations of qcd at high temperature have the structure of kvb solutions .    in a subsequent step",
    "we apply the techniques that were successful in detecting the constituent monopoles at high temperature to gauge configurations generated on a torus . for the torus",
    "no equivalent of kvb solutions is known .",
    "however , several articles have put forward the idea that also at low temperatures constituents with fractional charge build up lumps with integer topological charge @xcite .",
    "our finding , that when changing the fermionic boundary condition the zero - mode does change its position , indicates that indeed an excitation with topological charge @xmath0 = 1 is built from several separate lumps .",
    "for our runs we use gauge ensembles generated with the lscher - weisz action @xcite with coefficients from tadpole improved perturbation theory .",
    "we work at two different values of the inverse gauge coupling @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "a determination of the lattice spacing based on the sommer parameter gives @xmath10 fm and @xmath11 respectively @xcite .",
    "at those two couplings we generate configurations on @xmath12 lattices .",
    "the two values of @xmath13 then give rise to an ensemble in the confining phase ( @xmath8 ) and an ensemble in the deconfined phase ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the corresponding temperatures are 287 and 350 mev .",
    "the critical temperature for the qcd phase transition was determined as @xmath14 mev for the lscher - weisz action @xcite .",
    "we restrict ourselves to configurations with topological charge @xmath4 , by considering configurations with a single zero - mode .",
    "thus problems with mixing of different zero - modes are avoided . from two larger samples of typically 400 configurations we selected 70 configurations with charge @xmath15 for @xmath8 and 89 configurations for @xmath9 .    for the deconfined ensemble ( @xmath9 ) the polyakov loop has a non - vanishing expectation value .",
    "due to the @xmath16 symmetry of the gauge action the polyakov loop can come with three different values for its phase @xmath17 .",
    "the dirac operator does not have this symmetry and thus the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the dirac operator will behave differently for real , respectively complex polyakov loop .",
    "we found that of the 89 configurations in the deconfined phase 25 have real polyakov loop and 64 have @xmath18 . in the following",
    "we will often refer to these two subsets as the real and complex sector .",
    "finally we also generated a low temperature ensemble on @xmath19 lattices at @xmath9 .",
    "it consists of 46 configurations . for all ensembles we use periodic boundary conditions for the gauge fields .",
    "in table  [ confdata ] we summarize the parameters of our ensembles .",
    "we quote the lattice size , the inverse gauge coupling , the statistics , the lattice spacing and the temperature in mev as well as in units of @xmath1 .",
    "we formally asign also a temperature to the @xmath19 ensemble even though no temporal direction is distinguished by the lattice geometry .",
    ".parameters of our gauge ensembles .",
    "[ confdata ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +   +    in fig .",
    "[ densz16b845_032a ] we show @xmath20-slices of the scalar density for configuration 32 ( in the plots we again label these two axes as @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "the slices were taken through the maxima of the two peaks , i.e.  at @xmath23 = 5,8 ( left column of plots ) , respectively at @xmath23 = 15,15 ( right column of plots ) .",
    "we use values of @xmath24 showing the two extremal situations where only one of the lumps dominates ( @xmath25 , top ) and @xmath26 , bottom ) and an intermediate situation ( @xmath27 , middle ) . note the different scale for the two columns of plots .",
    "the data we show are from the run with the boundary phase attached in 1-direction .",
    "the plots show clearly that the zero - mode changes its location with @xmath5 . the same pattern with certain values of @xmath5 where a single lump dominates and intermediate values with an advancing and a retreating lump is also seen for the other configurations which visit two or three lumps .",
    "equivalent plots taken for the zero - modes computed with boundary conditions in 2-direction show similar behavior .",
    "the lumps sit at the same positions and even have similar shape , such as e.g.  the slightly elongated form along the @xmath21-axis in the plots in the left columns .",
    "let us now try to analyze the common features of all configurations in the ensemble .",
    "we start with discussing the inverse participation ratio as a function of @xmath5 . in fig .",
    "[ ipr_vs_phase_z16_b845 ] we show two such figures where we again distribute the 10 configurations among two plots , with the l.h.s .",
    "plot containing configurations 32 , 64 , 82 and 93 and configurations 103 , 351 , 354 , 522 , 561 on the r.h.s .",
    "we remark that configuration 61 which is also listed in table [ confsz16b845 ] has values of @xmath28 above 50 for all @xmath5 such that this defect - like lump does not show up for the plot - range we have chosen .",
    "the plots show that some of the configurations display quite a sizeable change in their localization as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "four of the zero - modes ( 64 , 93 , 103 , 351 ) show only relatively small changes of their inverse participation ratio .",
    "an inspection of table [ confsz16b845 ] shows that this behavior seems to be correlated with neither @xmath29 nor with the number of lumps visited by the zero - mode .",
    "let us now address the question whether changing its location is a common property of the zero - modes for our ensemble on the torus .",
    "we do this by again analyzing histograms for the distance @xmath29 between the maxima of the periodic and anti - periodic scalar density and histograms for the overlap between the two lumps . in fig.[disthistoz16b845 ] we show such plots with the histogram for the distance on the l.h.s .  and the histogram for the overlap on the r.h.s .",
    "the histograms were taken from all 46 configurations in our ensemble on the torus .",
    "the histogram for the distance @xmath29 shows that indeed configurations are quite abundant where the zero - mode changes its position by a sizeable amount , larger than a simple deformation by a fluctuation . in particular about half of the configurations",
    "show a @xmath29 of at least 6 in lattice units , i.e.  the centers of the lumps are at least 0.56 fm apart .",
    "the distance @xmath29 reaches values up to 13 in lattice units , i.e.  1.22 fm .",
    "the histogram for the relative overlap shows that even most of the zero - modes that do not change their location suffer some deformation when changing the boundary condition , such that the relative overlap is pushed below 1 .    finally in fig .",
    "[ iprscatterz16b845 ] we show a scatter plot of the periodic inverse participation ratio @xmath30 versus its anti - periodic counterpart @xmath31 . for the deconfined phase the equivalent plot shown in fig .",
    "[ iprscatter ] has revealed an asymmetry between periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions which is closely related to the critical values of @xmath5 where the zero - mode can change its location . for the ensemble on the torus our fig .",
    "[ iprscatterz16b845 ] does not reveal such a structure and the data essentially scatter symmetrically around the line @xmath32 which we display as a dashed straight line .",
    "this indicates that for the torus we do not find a pronounced pattern which links the localization of the mode to particular values of @xmath5 .",
    "in this article we have studied properties of topological excitations of su(3 ) lattice gauge configurations with topological charge @xmath4 . through the index theorem",
    "such configurations give rise to a single zero - mode of the dirac operator .",
    "the zero - mode is localized on the topological excitation and reflects the properties of the underlying lump in the gauge field .",
    "we analyzed how the zero - mode changes when applying an arbitrary phase @xmath2 at the temporal boundary condition for the dirac operator .",
    "our main findings are :    * for the ensemble in the deconfined phase we find that the zero - mode can change its position at @xmath25 for configurations with real polyakov loop and at @xmath33 for configurations in the complex sector .",
    "* the zero - mode is very spread out at these critical values and most localized for @xmath26 for real polyakov loop , respectively @xmath34 for the complex sectors . *",
    "these observations nicely match the predictions for zero - modes of kvb solutions . *",
    "an analysis of the spectral gap shows the same periodic behavior in @xmath5 supporting earlier findings of only a single transition temperature for chiral symmetry restoration in all sectors of the polyakov loop .",
    "* for the ensemble in the confined phase just below @xmath1 we find that for a large portion of our ensemble the zero - mode is located at different positions when changing the boundary condition .",
    "* also the localization of the mode fluctuates considerably during a complete cycle through @xmath5 . *",
    "when analyzing the time dependence one finds that the zero - modes are stretched along the time direction for both ensembles above and below @xmath1 . * several properties of zero - modes in the confined phase match predictions for kvb zero modes , but",
    "the resemblance is not as close as in the deconfined phase . * also the zero - modes for configurations on the torus",
    "change their location when changing the phase at the boundary . *",
    "the results obtained when applying the boundary condition at different directions are consistent with each other .",
    "* about half of our torus configurations have zero - modes located at different positions when comparing periodic to anti - periodic boundary conditions .",
    "our results show that for a large portion of our configurations an excitation with topological charge @xmath0 = 1 is not a single lump .",
    "instead it is built from several independent objects and does not resemble a simply connected instanton - like object",
