    "neutrino mass is now one of the most important targets in cosmology .",
    "since neutrino mass affects the evolution of the universe in some observable ways , a mass constraint can be obtained from the cosmological data such as cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , galaxy clustering @xcite , lyman-@xmath13 forest @xcite , and weak lensing data @xcite .",
    "although atmospheric , solar , reactor and accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments can probe mass differences precisely ( @xmath14  ev@xmath10 and @xmath15  ev@xmath10 , where @xmath16 is the mass of the @xmath17-th neutrino mass eigenstate and errors are 1@xmath4 @xcite ) , they are not sensitive to absolute values .",
    "absolute mass may be inferred from terrestrial experiments such as tritium beta decay and neutrino - less double beta decay @xcite , but , cosmological measurements from several observables have the potential to deliver higher accuracy .",
    "analyses of the cmb data alone constrain neutrino masses , but there is a relatively large degeneracy between neutrino masses and the hubble constant @xcite .",
    "a combination of different data sets can tighten limits .",
    "cmb data and matter power spectrum measurements can be usefully combined , since the suppression of the power spectrum below the damping scale is dependent on the mass of free - streaming neutrinos .",
    "a neutrino mass constraint has previously been derived @xcite that combines cmb data with measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) scale , supplemented by luminosity distance measurements from type - ia supernovae .",
    "since these non - cmb observations directly characterize the distance scale , a high accuracy prior on the hubble constant can have a qualitatively similar effect , as was first demonstrated for wmap first - year data by @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the extent to which priors on the hubble constant improve constraint on neutrino mass , without using matter power spectrum data ( see also @xcite ) . because systematic errors for estimating the hubble constant and the matter power spectrum are different , these parallel routes to estimate neutrino mass are important .",
    "we focus on the newly reported measurement of the hubble constant @xcite that has a rather higher central value and about two times smaller error than that of previous work @xcite .",
    "we also study the effect of tighter priors on the hubble constant , anticipating that the accuracy of estimates will improve over time , at least through measurement of distance to a large number of galaxies in the hubble flow that host water maser sources @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we denote the hubble constant in unit of km / s / mpc as @xmath0 .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the neutrino mass constraints using the current cmb data set and the hubble constant measurements .",
    "we demonstrate the degeneracy between neutrino masses and the hubble constant in analysis of cmb data alone , where we consider wmap5 , acbar , cbi , boomerang and quad .",
    "we also demonstrate improvement in the constraint through addition of the hubble constant determination of ref .",
    "the degeneracy in the cmb mainly originates from that in the angular diameter distance to last scattering surface , so another observation probing such distances will also be helpful to obtain the constraint .",
    "hence we also make an analysis that includes the bao scale measurement released recently @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : planck ] , future expected limits for neutrino masses are presented , with particular attention to the role of the prior on @xmath0 . for this purpose , we use projected planck cmb data and uncertainties in @xmath0 that may plausibly be anticipated from estimation of distances to galaxies containing water maser sources @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the effect of future bao data such as the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) on the neutrino mass constraint . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nu_mass_hubble ] and [ sec : planck ] , a flat universe and a cosmological constant for dark energy are assumed .",
    "however , in sec .",
    "[ sec : de_curvature ] , we investigate the constraint for the case of a constant equation of state for dark energy and a non - flat universe .",
    "the final section summarizes the paper .",
    "we first derive limits on neutrino mass using cmb data from wmap and other small angular scale measurements , including recently released quad data @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate the degeneracy between neutrino masses and the hubble constant in the cmb data analysis , which originates from geometry . in light of this , we examine how the mass limit is improved by adding a prior on @xmath0 obtained from the hst key project ( kp ) @xcite and a newly available one from the supernovae and @xmath0 for the equation of state ( shoes ) program @xcite .",
    ".adopted prior ranges for cosmological parameters described in the main text .",
    "in addition to top - hat priors on the primary parameters , we also impose an additional prior @xmath18 $ ] , which is hardcoded in cosmomc by default . also note that the prior ranges for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , shown in the parentheses , are adopted only when",
    "they are varied in section [ sec : de_curvature ] . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we have investigated constraint of neutrino mass from cosmological data with particular attention to direct measurements of the hubble constant and bao scale as supplements to cmb data . since a strong degeneracy exists between @xmath1 and @xmath0 in the cmb analysis , which originates from the distance scale , neutrino mass is not effectively constrained from the current cmb observations alone .",
    "however , available measurement of @xmath0 breaks this degeneracy and provides a mass constraint of @xmath21 ( 95% c.l . ) .",
    "we have also examined the constraint using the bao data recently released .",
    "when the measurement of bao scales is combined with the present cmb data , we obtain a similar limit for @xmath1 ; current hubble constant and bao measurements are competitive in the context of @xmath3cdm models , where we emphasize the eos of dark energy is constrained to be @xmath6 and curvature is zero .",
    "we have also studied attainable limits on @xmath1 that may be anticipated from next - generation data sets . for this purpose ,",
    "we have used projected planck data in combination with a future precise measurement of @xmath0 and of the bao scale as may be provided by boss before 2015 . if the hubble constant is directly measured with precision @xmath22 , then neutrino mass can be detected at the @xmath23 level for a @xmath24 mass .",
    "similar accuracy can be achieved through combination of bao and cmb data .",
    "the uncertainty of the hubble constant degrades the constraint on the neutrino mass approximately as @xmath25 . a more modest accuracy of e.g.",
    ", 3% does not provide a useful mass constraint and favors bao techniques .    in models",
    "where @xmath20 or @xmath19 are allowed to vary ( including more parameters ) , the geometric degeneracy between @xmath1 and @xmath0 is broadened , and combinations of data and priors ( i.e. , cmb+@xmath0 or cmb+bao ) do not strongly constrain @xmath1 .",
    "however when both @xmath0 measurement and bao are combined with cmb , the constraint becomes tighter . in this respect",
    ", a direct measurement of @xmath0 should be very beneficial along with other cosmological observations .",
    "we have investigated the impact of precision measurement of @xmath0 on the neutrino mass .",
    "the analysis demonstrates that the application of cosmological data has a unique contribution to make in the study of fundamental physics .",
    "analyses similar to ours would plausibly demonstrate strong constraint of other parameters , e.g. , @xmath20 @xcite , though degeneracies will vary case to case .",
    "in general cases ( e.g. , nonzero curvature and @xmath26 ) , the constraints imposed by future bao and @xmath0 measurements , if of comparable accuracy , are likely contribute at about the same level , but the larger number of model parameters argues pursuit of both bao and @xmath0 measurements , so as to leverage the independence of systematic errors in each .",
