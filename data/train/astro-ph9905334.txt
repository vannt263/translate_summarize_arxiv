    "since the members of an open cluster are assumed to be of same age and chemical composition , these stars are currently used to test the validity of stellar evolution theories , mainly because main sequence stars define a tight sequence in a colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "unfortunately , this tightness is sometimes misleading because of the contamination by field stars , the presence of unresolved binaries and also the influence of stellar rotation on the location of massive stars in cmds . alternatively , well - detached binaries are powerful tests when fundamental parameters are accurately known ( see the comprehensive review by andersen 1991 on double - lined eclipsing binaries ) .",
    "unfortunately , the determination of their chemical composition often remains a difficult and unresolved issue .",
    "it appears therefore that a better test could be performed by combining both advantages , that is , testing the tracks with well - detached double - lined binaries which are members of open clusters .",
    "we have applied this idea to three well - detached binaries members of the hyades : 51 tau , v818 tau , and @xmath0 tau .",
    "torres et al . , 1997",
    "( [ tsl97a ] , [ tsl97b ] and [ tsl97c ] ) obtained the first complete visual - spectroscopic solutions for the 3 above - mentionned systems , from which they carefully derived very accurate parallaxes and individual masses .",
    "they also gathered some individual photometric data in the johnson system .",
    "furthermore , we found useful trigonometric parallaxes information in the hipparcos catalogue ( esa , 1997 ) . by combining the two sources of data , we investigate the influence of the hipparcos parallaxes on our method which was developed to test stellar evolutionary models in hr diagrams .      among the most",
    "widely used stellar theoretical tracks in the literature are those computed by the geneva group ( see charbonnel et al .",
    "1993 and references therein ) and the padova group ( see fagotto et al . 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "we also used the stellar tracks from claret & gimnez ( 1992 ) ( cg92 thereafter ) .",
    "the tests are done with these 3 series of stellar tracks .",
    "the tests we want to perform are the following :    1 .   to check whether the two components of the systems are on the same isochrone , i.e. on a line defined by the same age and the same chemical composition for the two single stars .",
    "2 .   since all the selected stars are members of the hyades whose metallicity has been well measured ( according to the review of perryman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) : [ fe / h ] @xmath2 0.14 @xmath3 0.05 , i.e : z @xmath2@xmath4 ) , we can also check that the predicted metallicities from theoretical models are correct .",
    "3 .   for 51 tau and @xmath0 tau ,",
    "the individual stellar masses are known with an accuracy of about 10% , and for v818 tau , masses and radii are known with an accuracy close to 1 - 2% , allowing further tests with the theoretical models .    therefore ,",
    "if one of these criteria is not clearly fullfilled by a given set of tracks , then these models have obvious problems since they do not account for several observational constraints ( namely the metallicity , mass , radius , and/or the photometric data ) .",
    "we do not claim that the 6 selected hyades stars allow us to test without ambiguity any set of theoretical stellar tracks . since the data are presented in cmd , we are in fact testing not only the validity of the tracks but also of the photometric calibrations , and disentangling the relative influence of both is a tricky task .",
    "we use the basel stellar library ( basel ) photometric calibrations , extensively tested and regularly updated for a larger set of parameters ( see lejeune et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 and lastennet et al .",
    "1999a ) . for reasons developed in lastennet",
    "( 1999b ) , we assume that the calibrations from the basel models are reliable enough for this work ( for more details and references on the basel library , see contributions of lejeune et al . and",
    "westera et al . in this volume ) .      in order to derive simultaneously the metallicity ( z ) and the age ( t ) of the system , and to produce confidence level contours ( see figure 1 ) , we minimize the @xmath1-functional defined as :    @xmath5\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 is the primary and @xmath7 the secondary component .",
    "m@xmath8 and ( b@xmath9v ) are the observed values , and m@xmath8@xmath10 and ( b@xmath9v)@xmath11 are obtained from the synthetic computations of the basel models using a given set of stellar tracks .",
    "table below briefly summarizes the results ( see lastennet et al .",
