    "the study of electronic transport in quantum mesoscopic disordered systems has been a topic of interest for a long time . due to the random positions of the impurities in such systems ,",
    "quantum interference effects give rise to strong fluctuations in the conductance @xmath1 from sample to sample .",
    "these effects can be observed in a single disordered sample by changing , for example , the applied magnetic field @xcite , since this is similar to a change in the impurity configuration of the sample . as a consequence of these fluctuations a statistical study of the conductance is required .",
    "many efforts have been made in order to have a complete statistical description of the conductance in the three different regimes of transport @xcite : metallic ( @xmath2 ) , where @xmath3 is the localization length and @xmath4 the typical size of the system , insulating ( @xmath5 ) and crossover ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "it is known that in the metallic regime the distribution of the conductance @xmath0 is gaussian , so the first and second moments , i.e. , the average @xmath7 and the variance @xmath8 are enough to describe @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that in the deeply metallic regime @xmath9 is a pure number independent of the details of the system known as the universal conductance fluctuations , depending only on the presence or absence of time reversal symmetry and spin - rotational symmetry @xcite . in the opposite regime of transport ( insulating regime ) , the distribution of @xmath1 is log - normal , which means that @xmath10 follows a gaussian distribution .",
    "the intermediate regime of transport between the metallic and insulating regimes can be reached , for example , by increasing the disorder in a metallic sample . as the disorder",
    "is increased the conductance fluctuations grow in such way that @xmath9 becomes of the same order as @xmath7 . in this case , the first two moments are no longer enough to describe @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the full distribution of @xmath1 is needed in order to have a good statistical characterization of the electronic transport . however ,",
    "not much is known about the distribution of the conductance in the crossover regime , even in the case of a simple geometry like a quasi one - dimensional system or quantum wire ( @xmath11 , where @xmath4 is the length and @xmath12 is the width of the system ) , where a smooth transition from the metallic to the insulating regime exists .",
    "there are a number of numerical simulations in the intermediate regime which show a broad asymmetric distribution of @xmath1 with a flat part for values of @xmath13 and a strong decay for @xmath14 .",
    "also , these numerical results have shown an interesting qualitatively similar behavior of @xmath0 for quasi one , two and three dimensional systems .",
    "with respect to analytical results in the crossover region , the first two moments of the distribution of the conductance have been calculated , in fact , for all values of disorder for quasi one dimensional systems , using the supersymmetric non - linear sigma model ( @xmath15 model ) @xcite . for the complete distribution @xmath0 beyond the metal and insulator limits , a systematic method has recently been developed by two of us @xcite . using this method , we were able to calculate @xmath0 for quasi one - dimensional systems _ near the crossover regime , approaching on the insulating side_. it was predicted that on the insulating side @xmath0 follows a `` one - side '' log - normal distribution cut off by a gaussian for @xmath16 .",
    "numerical calculations have shown a cutoff at @xmath17 in the crossover and insulating regimes and a `` one - side '' log - normal distribution for @xmath13 , in the insulating region .",
    "the method reproduces other well known insulating and metallic limits .",
    "for example , using the results of @xcite , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the average and variance of @xmath1 as a function of the disorder parameter @xmath18 ; the first two moments agree quantitatively well with those from the @xmath15 model , in the metallic and insulating limits . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , @xmath0 is plotted for a metal and insulator case , using again the results of @xcite , which shows that the two limits are well captured by the method .",
    "however , the crossover regime is qualitatively correct only on the metallic and insulating sides , suggesting that the approximations made in @xcite are not as good for the complete crossover region .",
    "indeed , numerical simulations have shown that the drop in @xmath0 at @xmath16 appears to be exponential , as opposed to the gaussian cutoff predicted in @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to improve the approximations made in @xcite in order to obtain a better description of the crossover regime .    in this work",
    "we calculate the distribution of the conductance _ in the crossover regime _ using the proposed method in @xcite with some improvements .",
    "we show how @xmath0 changes from a broad highly asymmetric",
    " one - sided \" log - normal distribution on the insulating side of the crossover regime to a gaussian - like distribution on the metallic side of the crossover regime , as function of the disorder @xmath19 .",
    "the distribution at the crossover regime agrees with numerical results , except exactly at @xmath17 , which may be due to the existence of a singularity @xcite which might make our approximations less accurate .",
    "in order to study the conductance , we will use the scattering approach to electronic transport , in which the ( dimensionless ) conductance is given in terms of the transmission eigenvalues @xmath20 by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number of channels or transverse modes of the wire . due to the random positions of the impurities in a disordered sample",
    ", the eigenvalues @xmath20 fluctuate from sample to sample and the distribution of @xmath1 is given in general by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 indicates the average with the joint probability distribution of the transmission eigenvalues @xmath25 .",
    "for a mesoscopic quasi one - dimensional quantum wire , the evolution equation for the distribution @xmath25 as a function of the length of the system is given by the dorokhov - mello - pereyra - kumar ( dmpk ) equation @xcite .",
    "for systems without time reversal invariance or unitary symmetry , which is the case that we study here , the dmpk equation can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the mean free path .",

    "( [ pofxb - r ] ) .",
    "the calculation of @xmath0 from eq .",
    "( [ pofgfull ] ) involves a nontrivial n - fold integration .",
    "in the metallic regime , where the transmission eigenvalues @xmath40 contribute significantly to the conductance , the @xmath41 s ( @xmath42 ) are very close to each other and a continuum density for @xmath41 can be assumed . in this approximation",
    "the universal conductance fluctuations can be derived . on the other hand , in the insulating regime ,",
    "the @xmath41 s are much larger than the unity ( small transmission ) and separated exponentially . in this case ,",
    "the lowest eigenvalue gives the most important contribution to the conductance and within this approximation the log - normal distribution for @xmath1 can be derived .",
    "but none of these approximations can describe the crossover regime where the eigenvalues are neither very close to each other , nor exponentially separated .",
    "we will see , however , that it is possible to study @xmath0 in the crossover region by making systematic corrections from the metal and insulating regimes .    in order to calculate the distribution @xmath0 in the crossover regime , we propose , following @xcite , to _ separate out the two lowest eigenvalues _",
    "@xmath43 , _ treating the rest as continuum_. in @xcite only the lowest eigenvalue @xmath44 was separated out .",
    "we will see that by separating out one additional eigenvalue we can go beyond the region studied in @xcite . in the following",
    "we give a brief description of the important features of the current method in order to calculate @xmath0 .",
    "the general solution of the dmpk equation ( [ pofxb - r ] ) can be simplified for the cases @xmath45 ( metal ) and @xmath46 ( insulator ) . in these cases",
    "the integral over @xmath47 can be calculated analytically and the determinant is given , for example in the metallic regime , by a product of the difference of the square eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "the solution for both metallic and insulating regimes can be written as : @xmath48\\ ] ] with @xmath49 the @xmath50 function can be interpreted as the hamiltonian of n charges at the positions @xmath31 with a two body interaction given by @xmath51 and confinement potential @xmath52 .",
    "those terms are given by @xmath53 the parameter @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 in quasi - one - dimension .",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath57 correspond to the metallic and insulating limits , respectively .",
    "@xmath58 is the crossover regime .",
    "we can see from eq .",
    "( [ v(x ) ] ) that the one body potential @xmath52 in the insulating regime differs by a logarithmic term from the corresponding @xmath52 for a metal . in the localized regime",
    "the transmission is very small , i.e. @xmath59 ( since @xmath60 ) and then the logarithmic term is negligible compared to the other terms of @xmath52 .",
    "this means that the solution in the metallic regime might be used for the insulating regime as well .",
    "therefore , we will assume that the solution in the metallic regime is also valid for the intermediate regime .",
    "we remark that it is not always possible to write the general solution @xmath61 , eq .",

    "this fact suggests that we write @xmath83 for the shifted variables",

    "finally , it turns out that @xmath95 can be approximated by the product of the sum of two lorentzians whose parameters are determined by the limits @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "however , a posteriori numerical calculation showed that the contribution to the saddle point free energy @xmath99 coming from the @xmath95 term was negligible .",
    "so , in order to simplify our calculations we neglect this term .",
    "our last simplification is related to the interaction terms in @xmath75 : we consider only interactions between neighboring eigenvalues i.e. , @xmath100 and @xmath101 and neglect interactions between @xmath44 and @xmath102 .",
    "as mentioned before , we will check our approximations by comparing @xmath103 and var(@xmath1 ) with those from the @xmath15 model .    since the right hand side of eq .",

    "( [ pofgfunctional ] ) can be done exactly with the following result : @xmath108 where @xmath109    therefore once @xmath106 is obtained from @xmath75 , the calculation of the distribution @xmath0 is reduced to a triple integration , eq .",
    "( [ pofglast ] ) , which we compute numerically .",
    "note that the above described method can in principle be implemented fully numerically , without making approximations on @xmath95 or @xmath75 .",
    "the analytic approach allows us to identify the dominant terms and understand their change with disorder .",
    "the price we pay is that the expressions for the density and free energy are not valid for all possible values of @xmath31 ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "in fact , our expressions for @xmath75 and @xmath106 are restricted to values of @xmath111 .",
    "we will see , however , that it is enough to reach the region of main interest : the crossover regime .",
    "we start comparing our calculations to the first two moments available for all degree of disorder from the @xmath15 model @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows that the average and variance of @xmath1 is now better in the crossover region , compared to the previous calculation of @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the metallic regime is not described as good as in @xcite since we have neglected @xmath112 in eq .",
    "( [ u2shift ] ) and the interaction terms between @xmath113 and @xmath114 . actually , the approximations made in @xcite are quite good in this metallic regime , fig . [ fig1 ] , and we have included the results ( squares ) for the average and variance in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for completeness .",
    "similarly , our restriction to values of @xmath115 for @xmath75 does not allow us to go throughout the insulating regime , since in this regime the conductance is dominated by the first two eigenvalues @xmath116 . however",
    ", in our approach this region is very well described by two eigenvalues only as the density goes to zero . for completeness",
    ", we also include in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the results for such a calculation .",
    "our main goal in this work is to develop approximations that are valid in the crossover region , and as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , our current approximations lead to very good results in the desired region . the complete fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows that the two limiting regimes can be described within the same formulation using different set of approximations .    in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "we show the evolution of @xmath0 as we change the disorder parameter @xmath19 , evaluated within the current approximations valid in the crossover region .",
    "suppose that we start decreasing the disorder in a sample i.e. , we go from insulating to metallic behavior : at @xmath117 we obtain a broad distribution with a bump at small values of @xmath1 which is a reminiscence of the huge peak for @xmath118 in the insulating regime , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . also , at @xmath119 , @xmath0 has an exponential decay as has been seen in numerical simulations rather than the gaussian cutoff at @xmath16 predicted in @xcite .",
    "as @xmath19 is increased ( @xmath120 ) , the bump at @xmath121 disappears which makes @xmath103 increase and at the same time , the decay at @xmath16 becomes smoother .",
    "finally , when we decrease the disorder even more ( @xmath122 ) , we obtain a distribution which starts to look like a gaussian distribution , as is expected in the metallic regime .    in order to check our results in the crossover regime",
    ", we compare @xmath0 at @xmath117 with the distribution obtained numerically by plerou and wang @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows a good agreement with the numerical simulation @xcite , except at g=1 where our @xmath0 has a peak .",
    "others numerical simulations do not show any cusp at g=1 either .",
    "we believe that this behavior at g=1 comes from our restriction @xmath115 in the density @xmath75 , since as we go from the metallic to insulating regime large eigenvalues become more and more important",
    ". however , this peak eventually develops into the expected peak of the gaussian in the metallic regime . on the other hand ,",
    "an essential singularity of @xmath0 at @xmath17 has been found in @xcite in the crossover regime , on the insulating side .",
    "so it is conceivable that the peak present for @xmath117 due to the existence of this singularity disappears , since the method developed here may not be valid in the presence of such singularities .",
    "also , a non analytic behavior at @xmath17 has been found numerically in quasi one and three dimensional systems in the crossover regime @xcite .    in conclusion , we have developed a systematic method which allow us to calculate the distribution of the conductance in a quasi one - dimensional system . in particular",
    "we were interested in the distribution of @xmath1 across the crossover regime which had not been obtained before @xcite . separating out the two lowest eigenvalues and treating the rest as a continuum in the solution of the dmpk equation",
    ", we were able to obtain the evolution of @xmath0 as function the disorder parameter @xmath19 .",
    "we have shown how @xmath0 develops from a broad flat distribution at the crossover regime to a gaussian distribution in the metallic regime .",
    "our results for the average and variance agree with the exact results from the non linear sigma model and the distribution @xmath0 in the crossover regime agrees well with the numerical calculation @xcite , including an exponential decay for @xmath16 reported in numerical simulations .",
    "together with the earlier results of how a log - normal distribution on the insulating side develops a cutoff at @xmath17 and eventually becomes an asymmetric ` one - sided ' log - normal distribution near the crossover regime , this provides a relatively complete picture of how a log - normal distribution becomes a gaussian via a highly asymmetric intermediate one - sided log - normal distributions when disorder is changed .",
    "the quantitative details at @xmath17 at the crossover point remains an open question .",
    "although our results are valid strictly only for quasi one - dimensional systems where the dmpk equation is valid ( however , it has been shown that the restriction @xmath123 can be relaxed @xcite ) , a qualitatively similar behavior of @xmath0 is found numerically in 2 and 3 dimensional systems in the crossover regime .",
    "it is therefore possible that the method presented here could help understanding the generic behavior in higher dimensions at the crossover regime .",
