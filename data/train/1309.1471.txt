    "traditionally , the theory of many - body quantum systems has focused on the ground state and low - energy parts of the eigenspectrum .",
    "this is well - justified in solid - state systems which are usually in contact with a thermal bath and typically relax fast to low - energy sectors . as a result ,",
    "parts of the many - body eigenspectra away from the low - energy sector were generally considered to be of no interest , for much of the history of condensed matter physics .    in recent years",
    ", the perspective has changed due to the advent of new experimental setups , particularly those employing cold atom gases @xcite , which have promoted the study of non - equilibrium situations in _ isolated _ quantum systems @xcite . in an isolated situation",
    ", energy conservation ensures that a system with an initially high energy will not reach the low - energy parts of the spectrum ; the low - energy sector may thus be unimportant .",
    "this provides topical motivation to understand aspects of the full spectra of many - body systems .",
    "in particular , spectral structures in previously less - explored spectral regions can give rise to unexpected dynamical phenomena @xcite .",
    "in this work , we report and explain fine structures present in the eigenspectrum of the anisotropic heisenberg ( xxz ) chain with open boundary conditions .",
    "these spectral features are related to the binding of magnons and the spatial relationship of bound multi - magnons with the edges of the open chain .",
    "some related spectral fine structures were studied briefly in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was also found that these structures give rise to unexpected dynamics suppression phenomena ( ` edge - locking ' of bound multi - magnons ) .",
    "the study of this class of dynamics is now particularly important because of the remarkable recent success in constructing spin chains in cold - atom setups @xcite , which promises near - future experimental explorations of many types of time evolution experiments with finite - size spin chains .",
    "the xxz chain is a fundamental model of condensed matter physics , and has long been the subject of sustained theoretical activity .",
    "the open chain has received less detailed attention than the periodic case .",
    "the hamiltonian for an @xmath0-site chain is @xmath1.\\ ] ] the summation runs from @xmath2 to @xmath3 with open boundary conditions , and runs to @xmath4 with periodic boundary conditions , the site @xmath5 being identified with site @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath6 term acts as an ` interaction ' penalizing alignment of neighboring spins .",
    "the in - plane terms @xmath7 provide ` hopping ' processes .",
    "since @xmath8 preserves total @xmath9 , the dynamics is always confined to sectors of fixed numbers @xmath10 of up - spins . for simplicity , our description will sometimes focus on small @xmath10 , i.e. , highly polarized spin chains .",
    "however , much of the phenomena described here is aso valid at smaller magnetization ( larger @xmath10 ) .",
    "we will mostly consider the large @xmath11 regime , where the spectral structures are most prominent .",
    "when not specified , energy and time are measured in units of @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "@xcite have experimentally realized the xxz chain hamiltonian with @xmath14 using two hyperfine states of a bosonic species in a mott phase . ref .",
    "@xcite has also explored the propagation of bound multi - magnons , of particular relevance to the physics described in the present manuscript .",
    "a setup suitable for realizing large @xmath11 values is currently under development @xcite .",
    "in addition , the xxz model has been shown to describe josephson junction arrays of the flux qubit type @xcite , and may also be realizable in optical lattices @xcite or with polaritons in coupled arrays of cavities @xcite .",
    "it should be possible to explore the spectral structures and associated dynamical phenomena described in the present article in one of these settings in the foreseeable future .    at large @xmath11 ,",
    "the number of domain walls ( bonds connecting oppositely pointing spins ) is a good indicator of energy , and the spectrum accordingly splits up into energetically separated groups of eigenstates or ` bands ' .",
    "section [ sec_overall_bands ] describes this gross ` band ' structure and the difference between open and periodic chains . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the open chain spectrum not only has more bands than the periodic chain spectrum , but each of the bands also has intricate sub - structures . ref .",
    "@xcite studied the top two bands and dynamical phenomena associated with them .",
    "this is briefly reviewed in section [ sec_top_two ] . the main object of this paper is to describe and explain the substructures in the bands lower in the spectrum . in sections [ sec_third ] and [ sec_fourth ]",
    ", we explain the main sub - band structures within the third and fourth bands from the top .",
    "section [ sec_dynamics_3rdband ] presents real - time evolution results which highlight the structure of the third band .",
    "( average number of domain walls ) of eigenstates , indexed in order of increasing energy , for ( a ) open boundary conditions , and ( b ) periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we show the @xmath15 sector , for a @xmath16 chain at large anisotropy @xmath17",
    ". there are @xmath18 bands in the obc spectrum and @xmath15 bands in the pbc spectrum . ]     energy and @xmath19 of eigenstates for @xmath15 , @xmath20 chain with open boundary conditions for several @xmath11 values .",
    "the bands in energy start appearing at high @xmath11 ; at moderate @xmath11 the band structure is easier to see through the jumps in @xmath19 . ]    at @xmath21 , the spectrum splits into bands . in this limit ,",
    "the in - plane terms in the hamiltonian can be neglected , and we see a grouping of states into blocks that have different numbers of ` domain walls ' or ` anti - ferromagnetic nearest neighbors ' , @xmath22 .    the quantity @xmath22 can be defined as an operator @xmath23 which is diagonal in the @xmath24 basis . in the ising limit",
    "this quantity has integer values for each eigenstate .",
    "the value depends on the boundary conditions ( since the range of the summation index @xmath25 does ) ; e.g. , the state @xmath26 has @xmath27 for periodic boundary conditions , but it is only @xmath28 for open boundary conditions .    for @xmath15",
    ", there are three bands in the periodic chain , corresponding to configurations with ( _ i _ ) the three @xmath29 spins next to each other ( @xmath30 ) , ( _ ii _ ) two @xmath29-spins neighboring each other and one disjoint ( @xmath31 ) , ( _ iii _ ) the three @xmath29 spins all non - neighboring ( @xmath32 ) . in the open chain , the edge allows also configurations with odd @xmath22 values ; hence there are six bands .",
    "the total number of states in the @xmath15 sector is @xmath33 .",
    "table  [ table1 ] collects the number of states in different bands for both open and closed chains , and lists corresponding @xmath22 values .",
    "these counting arguments can be readily generalized to larger @xmath10 sectors .",
    "the band structure survives at finite but large anisotropies @xmath11 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates this for the @xmath15 sector with @xmath34 . also shown here is the expectation value of @xmath35 as defined above .",
    "althought the finite-@xmath11 eigenstates of the hamiltonian are not eigenstates of the operator @xmath35 , the expectation value of @xmath35 nevertheless remains close to the integer value expected for @xmath36 , and there are sharp jumps of @xmath37 across bands .    to show the extent to which the band structure survives at smaller @xmath11 , figure [ fig2 ] collects data for the open chain for a range of values of @xmath11 .",
    "we see that @xmath38 is a rather sharp indicator of the band structure .",

    "each band being labeled by a value of @xmath22 .",
    "the numbers sum to the total number of states in the full @xmath15 sector , @xmath40 .",
    "there are only three bands for the closed chain , corresponding to @xmath30,@xmath41 , and @xmath42 , and six bands for the open chain . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     next we will consider the fourth band from the top , corresponding to @xmath43 at large @xmath11 . this band does not appear for @xmath44 and is the lowest ( last ) band for @xmath45 , discussed briefly at the end of the section .    for @xmath46 , we can only get configurations with @xmath31 in one of the following two ways :    * there are three isolated groups of contiguous @xmath47-spins , one pinned to the left end of the chain , one to the right end , and the third in between not pinned to either end .",
    "* there are two isolated groups of contiguous @xmath47-spins , neither of which is pinned to an end .    to count the number of configurations of type ( a ) , let us say there are @xmath48 up - spins on the left end , and @xmath49 up - spins on the right end ( with @xmath50,@xmath51 ) , and @xmath52 up - spins in between , such that @xmath53 .",
    "the number of ways of choosing @xmath48 and @xmath49 is @xmath54 . for each of these ways of choosing @xmath55 , there are @xmath56 ways of putting the central block of @xmath52-up - spins .",
    "thus there are @xmath57 states of type ( a ) . in order to count the number of ways of doing case ( b )",
    ", we first observe that there are @xmath58 ways in which @xmath10 can be divided between the two groups .",
    "for each of these ways of division , there are @xmath59 ways of positioning the two groups in the available @xmath60 spots .",
    "thus the total number of states of type ( b ) is @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the total number of states in this band is @xmath62 . for @xmath39 ,",
    "this reduces to @xmath63 ( table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "we will next examine and explain the leading ( first - order ) substructure of this band .",
    "figure [ fig3](b ) zooms into the fourth band for @xmath39 : we see @xmath64 subbands each containing @xmath64 states .",
    "the same subband structure persists at larger @xmath65 ; however for @xmath66 there is also a `` flat patch '' at @xmath67 , analogous to the flat patch encountered above for the third band .",
    "as done for the third band , we use first - order degenerate perturbation theory .",
    "again , we start by writing the original hamiltonian as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 . when @xmath72 , all the states in the @xmath73 band have identical energy @xmath67 in units of @xmath74 , regardless of @xmath10 .",
    "( e.g. , in figures [ fig3](b ) and [ fig7](a ) the fourth band is seen to be around @xmath75 for @xmath20 . )",
    "again , we have the task of diagonalizing the matrix @xmath76 , where @xmath77 are the @xmath62 degenerate eigenstates that constitute the fourth band when @xmath78",
    ". we will show below that the matrix @xmath79 can entirely be written as blocks of 1-toeplitz matrices @xmath80 , and that there are @xmath64 such blocks each having size @xmath64 , independent of @xmath81 . of the @xmath64 blocks ,",
    "@xmath82 are made of configurations of type ( a ) and @xmath83 are composed of configurations of type ( b ) .",
    "configurations of type ( a ) and type ( b ) do not mix at first order and naturally separate into blocks .",
    "table [ table2 ] ( left ) shows an example of @xmath64 type-(a ) configurations which are connected by single hoppings .",
    "most of these states have a single ` free ' @xmath47 spin in the interior .",
    "the number of ways of splitting the remaining @xmath84 spins into left and right blocks is @xmath85 ; e.g. , for @xmath86 we can have two @xmath47 s at the left edge and one @xmath47 at the right , or one @xmath47 at the left edge and two at the right .",
    "there are thus @xmath85 toeplitz blocks @xmath87 contributed by ( a)-type configurations to the @xmath79 matrix .",
    "we now turn to the contributions from ( b ) type configurations .",
    "table [ table2 ] ( right ) shows an example of @xmath64 type-(b ) configurations connected by single hoppings , so that they form a @xmath87 block in the @xmath79 matrix .",
    "if thought of as a time evolution sequence , this is a `` quantum bowling '' event as studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a single ` particle ' ( @xmath47-spin ) passes through a ` wall ' of @xmath84 particles , by turning into a ` hole ' while during the transmission and shifting the wall by two sites in the process .",
    "all the contributing states of type ( b ) fall into this class of blocks .",
    "the number of ways in which one can arrange the @xmath65 @xmath47-spins into a block of @xmath88 to the left of a single @xmath47-spin on the second - rightmost site , is @xmath89 ; as a result there are @xmath89 toeplitz blocks from ( b ) type configurations .",
    "therefore , we now see that the nonzero part of the @xmath79 matrix is composed of @xmath90 blocks of @xmath87 : @xmath91 ( the zero blocks are omitted . ) once again using the results of @xmath92-toeplitz matrices  @xcite , the eigenvalues of @xmath79 are found to be @xmath93 with each eigenvalue being @xmath64 times degenerate .",
    "so , the energies of the sub - bands of the fourth band should be given by @xmath94 .",
    "the nonzero part of the @xmath79-matrix has size @xmath95 , which is less than the number of states , @xmath96 , in the fourth band , for any @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , in addition to the @xmath64 groups of states at energies @xmath94 , there is an additional group of states at energy @xmath97 .",
    "for odd @xmath0,the middle of the @xmath64 groups falls at @xmath97 ( because @xmath98 ) and adds to the central patch .    in figure [ fig7 ]",
    ", we show a comparison for the @xmath86 sector between perturbative results and the actual spectra .",
    "our explanation based on first - order perturbation theory captures the essential features even for anistoropies as low as @xmath99 .    for @xmath39",
    ", there is no zeros block because the @xmath64 groups of @xmath64 states each exhaust the fourth band ; @xmath100 .",
    "an example spectrum appeared in figure [ fig3](b ) .",
    "fourth band from the top of the @xmath101 spectrum , for open chains of size @xmath20 and @xmath102 . dashed horizontal lines are from first - order degenerate perturbation theory , @xmath94 .",
    "panel ( a ) has a large anisotropy , @xmath103 , so that the perturbative calculations are quite accurate . at smaller @xmath17 ,",
    "the essential structure is the same , but each subband now deviates slightly from the first - order prediction , has visible dispersion , and also visible higher - order sub - structures .",
    "one of the groups of @xmath64 merges with the `` zeros block '' at @xmath104 for the odd - sized chain ( b ) , but not for the even - site chain ( a ) . ]      for @xmath45 , the fourth band from the top is the ` last ' ( lowest - energy ) band and does not have the substructure of @xmath105 steps . examining the @xmath79 matrix shows why this case is different . for @xmath106 ,",
    "only configurations of type ( b ) occur : these contain two isolated single @xmath47 spins which can both move by first - order processes .",
    "hence the @xmath79 matrix of first order couplings will have four entries on most rows , so that it is not of 1-toeplitz type .",
    "the problem is equivalent to two spinless fermions on an open @xmath107-site chain with forbidden nearest - neighbor occupancy .",
    "the spectrum is thus quite different from the fourth - band structures for @xmath108 .",
    "the bands farther down in the spectrum have less pronounced structure . for the @xmath109 band , degenerate perturbation theory at first order leads to a complicated degeneracy matrix which is similar to that encountered in the pathological @xmath45 case of the fourth band ; numerical diagonalization of this matrix reproduces the actual spectrum at large @xmath11 , but we were unable to obtain simple analytic expressions .",
    "we have focused on subband structures that appear at first order in the hopping ( @xmath12 ) term . as in the second band from the top @xcite , there are various higher - order substructures present in the third and fourth bands , especially for larger @xmath65 .",
    "a full exploration is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "however , we make a couple of higher - order observations here .",
    "first , within the @xmath64-groups of the 4-th band , in figure [ fig7](b ) we can see a separating out of four states from the rest , at order @xmath110 , just as happens in the second band .",
    "in fact , just as in the second band @xcite , for larger @xmath0 this is the beginning of a recursive splitting , where 4 levels separate out from the rest of the @xmath64 , @xmath111 , ... levels at order @xmath110 , @xmath112 , ... until the @xmath64 states are exhausted .",
    "second , within the central patch of the third band which is a zeros block at first order , one can zoom in to find pairs of states forming second order dispersions .",
    "these correspond to the motion of bound bi - magnons , which are connected by second - order hoppings .",
    "we studied band structures and substructures in the open - boundary heisenberg chain at large anisotropy , using degenerate perturbation theory to explain the most prominent features .",
    "we also presented real - time evolution phenomena reflecting these spectral structures .",
    "the features of the spectrum we have examined relate in particular to the propagation and binding of magnons and collections of magnons in a ferromagnetic background .",
    "the study of this type of non - equilibrium situations is of growing current interest @xcite .",
    "the intriguing possibility of controlling such propagation phenomena using geometric features like edges and impurities deserves further exploration ; our dynamics results in section [ sec_dynamics_3rdband ] is just one such example .",
    "spectral structures such as band structures , and edge - locking phenomena , have also been found to be relevant to intriguing transport phenomena @xcite .",
    "our work also raises several other questions , e.g. , are there generic ways in which the spectral structures get modified at smaller @xmath11 ?",
    "it is also an open question how the intricate spectral structures get modified or destroyed if we have a weak bond rather than a fully open - boundary chain ; one can interpolate between periodic and open - boundary cases by weakening one of the bonds in a periodic chain .",
    "we have presented a real - time dynamical effect in section [ sec_dynamics_3rdband ] related to the first - order substructure of the third band .",
    "there should be various classes of non - equilibirum effects associated with the higher - order structures of both third and fourth bands , which may be worth exploring in detail . finally ,",
    "since the open xxz chain is integrable via bethe ansatz , intricate structures in the spectrum are reflected in intricate structures in the bethe ansatz roots , which sometimes show imaginary - real transmutations as a function of @xmath11 , as has been worked out for the @xmath106 sector in ref .",
    "@xcite . examining the bethe ansatz description of edge - related states for higher @xmath65 sectors remains an open task .",
