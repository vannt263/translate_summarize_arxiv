    "1 the experimental radii [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] of stable isotopes are shown in dependence on @xmath8 and @xmath9 . the experimental errors which in most of the cases are within an interval from 0.006 fm to 0.060 fm ,",
    "are not presented in the figure .",
    "one can see that the values of the radii of nuclids of different isotopes of one element in the graph of the dependance on @xmath9 are gathered in short vertical columns , whereas in the other graph the values are scattered around the line @xmath10 .",
    "the charge radii calculated by the following equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the average value of the charge radius of one nucleon in a nucleus and + @xmath13 fm for the nuclei with @xmath14 , + @xmath15 fm for @xmath16 , + @xmath17 fm for @xmath18 + have root mean square deviation from the experimental values of the most abundant isotopes @xmath19 fm .",
    "the formula to calculate the radii of the nuclei in dependence on @xmath9 or in dependence on the number of @xmath1-clusters @xmath20 is    @xmath21    where @xmath22 in case of even @xmath9 and in case of odd @xmath9 the value of @xmath23 is used . using + @xmath24 fm [ 1 ] for the nuclei with @xmath25 , + @xmath26 fm for @xmath27 , + @xmath28 fm for @xmath29 + gives @xmath30 fm .    in the both cases three values of @xmath12 and @xmath31",
    "have been used .",
    "the changing the slope of the functions is explained by the formation of a core , which starts growing from the nucleus with @xmath32 , @xmath33 . for the nuclei with @xmath34 , @xmath27 , the number of clusters of the core is comparable with the number of peripheral clusters having the size of nucleus @xmath35 . for the other nuclei with @xmath36 , @xmath37 ,",
    "the number of clusters of the core prevails and the mean radius of a core cluster is revealed as to be @xmath38 fm .",
    "it was shown before that the size of a nucleus is determined by the @xmath1-cluster structure and the root mean square radius @xmath0 of a nucleus can be estimated by a few ways on the number of @xmath1-clusters in it [ 6,7 ] , disregarding to the number of excess neutrons .",
    "one of the ways to estimate @xmath0 is ( 2 ) .    to explain the paradox that both ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) can well describe the experimental radii @xmath39 the following hypothesis was proposed [ 8 ] .",
    "the @xmath3-stability , which the most abundant isotopes belong to , is provided by the particular number of excess neutrons in the isotope that is needed to fill in the space between the volumes occupied by the charge and the matter of the alpha clusters of the core .",

    "the value of the radius of one nucleon of @xmath1-cluster matter of the core @xmath50 fm , which corresponds to @xmath51 fm , and the value of @xmath52 fm were found [ 8 ] .    in this paper the hypothesis that @xmath53 provides the @xmath3-stability is developed .",
    "the root mean square charge radii @xmath0 of nuclei are calculated by a phenomenological formula [ 6 ] with using charge radius of the core and the radius of the peripheral @xmath1-cluster position @xmath54 in the nucleus .",
    "the formula to calculate @xmath54 was obtained from an independent analysis of the differences of proton and neutron single particle binding energies in the framework of the @xmath1-cluster model based on @xmath55-pair interactions .    in the article",
    "it is shown that for the nuclei with @xmath36 the value of @xmath0 is almost independent of how many of the peripheral clusters @xmath41 are placed on the surface of the core at the same radius @xmath54 from the center of mass @xmath56 . however , in order to have the radius of an isotope @xmath2 equal to its charge radius @xmath0 in the case of different numbers of peripheral clusters the different number of excess neutrons is needed .",
    "this may explain why the nuclids of different isotopes have close values of their radii and this also explains the width of the narrow path of @xmath3-stability .",
    "the radius @xmath0 of a nucleus is measured in electron scattering experiments as the root mean square radius @xmath57 of the charge distribution .",
    "the @xmath58 ( 2 ) has meaning of @xmath59 .",
    "the equality @xmath60 can be provided by the only condition that the charge density distribution @xmath61 , which is in an agreement with the results of analysis of the charge distribution of heavy nuclei , see fig .",

    "is used    @xmath66    where @xmath67 denotes mean square radius of charge distribution of the core and @xmath68 denotes the mean square radius of the charge distribution of peripheral clusters .",
    "this equation is obtained from the definition of the root mean square radius @xmath69 where the spherically symmetrical charge density distribution @xmath70 , normalized as @xmath71 is the sum of the charge density distributions of the core @xmath72 and the peripheral clusters @xmath73 with the corresponding normalization @xmath74    eq .",
    "( 6 ) is used for calculations of the charge and matter distributions of nuclei in the wave function approach with the single - particle potential model assumed in the shell model [ 9,10 ] in terms of the completed shells and the occupation numbers for the nucleons of the last not completed shell .",
    "taking into account that for the nuclei with @xmath36 , @xmath37 , the radius of one core @xmath1-cluster @xmath75 = 1.600 fm one can write for the case when @xmath76    @xmath77    the phenomenological formula [ 6 ] to calculate @xmath54 for the nuclei with @xmath78 , which has meaning of @xmath79 , is @xmath80    then the equation ( 6 ) to calculate the charge radii @xmath0 becomes    @xmath81    and for odd nuclei @xmath82 , taking into account that @xmath83 [ 6 ] , @xmath84    eq .",

    "it was shown that using ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) for the nuclei with @xmath36 , @xmath86 , gives a good fitting the experimental radii of the nuclids of the most abundant isotopes with @xmath87 , see , for example fig",

    "this means that @xmath0 for heavy nuclei does not significantly depend on the number of peripheral clusters @xmath41 .",
    "this explains why the radii calculated in the @xmath1-cluster model of completed shells @xmath98 [ 6 ] are close to @xmath0 . in the model",
    "a nucleus consists of the @xmath1-clusters of completed shells ( the nuclei @xmath64 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and the nuclei placed in the right side of the periodic table of elements were taken as ones with completed shells ) and the number of clusters of the last not completed shell with the radius of their position in the nucleus @xmath54 ( 8) .    the difference between the equation to calculate @xmath101 [ 6 ] and the equation to calculate @xmath102 ( 9 ) is that the value @xmath41 varies from 0 to 5 .",
    "for example @xmath103 of nucleus @xmath104 is calculated as a sum of @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the empirical values of @xmath54 in case of the nuclei with @xmath107 were found in the framework of the model of @xmath55-pair interactions [ 6,7 ] on the values of differences between the single - particle binding energies of last proton and neutron in the nuclei with @xmath85 .",
    "the value of @xmath98 for @xmath108 is calculated with using the radius of nucleus @xmath109 , as one with completed shells , and @xmath110 .",
    "for the nuclei with completed shells with @xmath111 the @xmath98 is calculated by ( 2 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath98 have deviation with the experimental data of the most abundant isotopes @xmath112 fm [ 6 ] .",
    "so one can say that a nucleus has a dense core with @xmath113 clusters and some peripheral clusters placed at the equal distances from the center of the core .",
    "the size r for the nuclei with @xmath37 does not depend significantly of the number @xmath114 .",
    "the radius of a @xmath3-stable isotope @xmath2 is dependent on the volume occupied by the core .",
    "it is implied that only those nuclids stay @xmath3-stable that have proper amount of excess neutrons to make the radii @xmath2 equal to the size of the charge of the nucleus @xmath0 .",
    "the experimental radii @xmath39 of different isotopes belonging to one element differ from each other but the values are close and the differences are restricted within several hundreds of fm . the radius of a nuclid @xmath2 ( 3 ) is calculated from the sum of cubic radii of its parts .",
    "let us consider first that there are four peripheral alpha clusters in the nuclei of even @xmath9 ( the mass number @xmath8 and the number of the excess neutrons @xmath46 ) and four and half peripheral alpha clusters in case of nucleus with odd @xmath115 ( the mass number @xmath116 and the number of excess neutrons @xmath117 ) .",
    "the excess neutron pairs are in the core and in case of odd @xmath9 nuclei one excess neutron is stuck with the single @xmath55-pair .",
    "the suggestion is supported by the fact that there is only one stable isotope @xmath118 ( the abundance of the isotope is 100% [ 11 ] ) .",
    "the link between the single pair with spin @xmath119 and the excess neutron with @xmath120 is explained by the spin correlation . the single neutron on the surface of the nucleus is not seen by the electrons scattered on the nucleus in the experimental measurement of the radius @xmath2 .",
    "then the radius of isotopes @xmath2 and @xmath121 of nuclei @xmath8 and @xmath116 are calculated by the following equations [ 8 ]    @xmath122    and @xmath123    the equations ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) can be used to calculate charge radii @xmath2 of any @xmath3-stable isotopes .    for the @xmath3-stable isotopes with @xmath124 @xmath125 . for the nuclei with @xmath126 @xmath2",
