    "since the late 1950s , there have been hundreds of space exploration missions that have provided data on the composition , structure and circulation of planetary atmospheres . in particular , the vertical pressure - temperature profile of the atmosphere of venus",
    "was accurately observed in the pioneer - venus ii mission in 1978 @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an averaged data of temperature , pressure and density of the venus atmosphere as a function of altitude above the surface is given . in this paper we will use this information .",
    "venus is the nearest planet to the sun .",
    "the incoming solar energy , of the order of @xmath2 , is almost twice as great as on earth .",
    "venus possess an atmosphere , which is about a hundred times as massive as that of the earth and its surface temperature reaches @xmath3 .",
    "carbon dioxide is the major component ( 96.5 per cent ) , and 3.5 per cent of @xmath4 is the next most abundant species .    in a recent paper by verkley and gerkema @xcite , henceforth denoted by vg , have proposed a first - principles variational method to generate a @xmath5 profile for an atmospheric column .",
    "this profile is the result of maximizing the entropy of the column , @xmath6 , maintaining fixed its mass , @xmath7 , enthalpy , @xmath8 , and the integral of the potential temperature , @xmath9 .",
    "this method is flexible enough to describe from an isothermal profile to an adiabatic one depending on the value of a unique parameter .",
    "vg applied these ideas to the earths troposphere and accurately reproduced the u.s .",
    "standard atmosphere .",
    "in their analysis , vg considered that the atmospheric gas is ideal , i.e. a gas that verifies the corresponding equation of state , and besides , the specific heats , @xmath10 , are constant . when this second assumption is also fulfilled it is said that the gas is perfect .",
    "these two hypotheses are quite reasonable when dealing with the atmosphere of the earth . for representative temperatures and pressures of the low venus atmosphere",
    ", however , the temperature dependence of the @xmath10 has to inescapably be taken into account .",
    "as our goal in this paper is the application of the vg ideas to the venus atmosphere , we have had to extend their original variational method to take into account this dependence of the specific heats on temperature .",
    "consequently we will first extend the vg method to ideal imperfect gases .",
    "as is well known , the temperature dependence of the @xmath10 comes from the excitation of some internal vibrational levels of the molecule when the temperature is high enough .    throughout the paper",
    "we will consider that @xmath11 is the main chemical component of the venus atmosphere .",
    "the chemical impurities coming from the @xmath4 produce negligible corrections in our analysis . besides",
    ", we will not consider any correction coming from the interaction between the molecules , that is , we will stick to the scenario of an ideal gas but with the afore - mentioned temperature dependence of the @xmath10 .",
    "corrections of real gas in the venus atmosphere have been considered @xcite but for our purposes here they are negligible .",
    "moreover , we will consider a constant gravity for the entire column under study because its variation with altitude has no impact in the results .",
    "the verification that the equation of state of ideal gases is good to describe the gas of venus can be done using the data of ref .",
    "there one can check , at each height , that using pressure and temperature as input , the value of density obtained from the equation of the ideal gases is , in all cases , equal to the experimental value with a discrepancy lower than @xmath12 per cent .",
    "the index of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will recall the meaning of the potential temperature , @xmath13 , for ideal perfect gases and its relation to the entropy . in section 3",
    ", we will review the vg method and comment on the main results when it is applied to the earths troposphere . in section 4 , we will put in evidence the necessity of considering an explicit dependence of the @xmath10 with temperature for the @xmath11 molecule , to properly describe the venus atmosphere . in section 5",
    ", we will calculate the equation of the potential temperature , i.e. the form of an adiabatic , when dealing with ideal - imperfect gases . in section 6",
    ", we will extend the vg method to ideal - imperfect gases . in section 7 , this new method will be applied to the venus atmosphere and the results will be commented on .",
    "finally , in section 8 we present our conclusions .",
    "the first principle of thermodynamics says that @xmath14 throughout this paper , @xmath15 indicates all the variations of thermodynamical quantities , whereas @xmath16 will be used to refer to variations of quantities at different altitudes .    for ideal gases , the equation of state , for @xmath17 ,",
    "is @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is the universal gas constant ) and the specific internal energy ( internal energy per unit mass , noted with lower case letter ) reads @xmath20 in an adiabatic process , @xmath21 , using the first two equations and remembering that @xmath22 , we find @xmath23    thus , two points @xmath24 and @xmath25 belonging to the same adiabatic trajectory fulfil @xmath26 in this case , the reference temperature @xmath27 becomes the so called potential temperature @xmath13 corresponding to the reference pressure @xmath28 . note that in the previous equations , @xmath29 has been considered as a temperature independent constant because in this section we are dealing with an ideal - perfect gas .",
    "this last equation constitutes one of the forms of expressing poissons equation for an adiabatic process .",
    "explicitly it reads as @xmath30 as it is standard , choosing the reference pressure @xmath31 , the potential temperature @xmath13 reads @xmath32 the potential temperature of a gas is therefore the temperature that it would take if we compress or expand it adiabatically to a reference pressure of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "obviously , the choice @xmath31 is only a question of convenience when we are dealing with the low atmosphere of the earth . in other words",
    ", the value of the reference pressure @xmath28 is arbitrary .",
    "the differential expression for the specific entropy of ideal gases is @xmath34 because of the definition of @xmath13 in eq.([theta ] ) , @xmath35 and consequently @xmath36 and because we are considering that @xmath29 is constant @xmath37 due to this direct relation , the potential temperature @xmath13 is usually considered as the entropy of the gas in the physics of the atmosphere .",
    "it is apparent that in a process of constant @xmath13 , the entropy is also constant .",
    "vg have proposed a first - principles variational method to generate a @xmath5 profile for an atmospheric layer . in this method",
    ", one considers a column of dry air with unit horizontal area in hydrostatic equilibrium , bounded by two fixed values of the pressure . at each altitude",
    "@xmath38 , the local thermodynamics is related to @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 that can be inverted into @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , since @xmath45 .",
    "the profile one is looking for comes out after the maximization of the entropy with the condition that the enthalpy and the vertical integral of the potential temperature , @xmath9 , are kept fixed . as the top and bottom pressures , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , of the column are specified , the total mass of air is also fixed .",
    "we denote by @xmath48 the total entropy , mass , enthalpy , and vertical integral of the potential temperature @xcite of the air column , respectively .",
    "the requirement of @xmath9 fixed is appropriate in the case of convective mixing .",
    "an analysis on this issue and its bibliographic antecedents are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as said above , vg imposed the maximization of @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 fixed , namely @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath51 being lagrange multipliers .",
    "this means that one should maximizes the entropy with respect to the temperature profile of the atmosphere with the constraints imposed .",
    "the profile variation is consequently performed along the column through the variation of the temperature keeping the pressure fixed at every altitude .    from the maximization with constraints ,",
    "vg deduced @xmath52 introducing @xmath53 and denoting the temperature at @xmath54 by @xmath55 , the resulting @xmath5 profile is @xmath56    this result is actually powerful ; note that it is able to describe a wide range of profiles , from an isothermal profile , in the @xmath57 limit , to an adiabatic profile in the limit of @xmath58 . in this last case ,",
    "@xmath54 and @xmath55 clearly become @xmath28 and @xmath13 respectively . in the application of this result to a specific air layer , @xmath59",
    "is fixed by requiring that the ratio @xmath60 , that derives from the profile , is equal to its real value in the air layer . then , @xmath55 is fixed by requiring that @xmath8 ( or @xmath9 ) is equal to its real value as well . using this method vg obtained a profile for the troposphere that fitted remarkably well the u.s .",
    "standard atmosphere data .",
    "the same method has been applied to the earths mesosphere @xcite .",
    "the molecule of @xmath11 is linear and consists of a carbon atom that is doubly bonded to two oxygen atoms .",
    "its molecular mass and corresponding specific gas constant are @xmath61    the various contributions to the specific heat , at constant pressure , of a gas constituted by molecules of this type are expressed in the form : @xmath62 the first term in this sum corresponds to translation and to rotational modes while the second term is due to vibrational modes .",
    "the sum in the second term extends to the various characteristic temperatures , @xmath63 , of the vibrational modes . for @xmath11 , these values",
    "are @xcite @xmath64    ) in units of @xmath65 as a function of temperature ( @xmath66 ) , of the @xmath11 molecule ( continuous line ) and its polynomial fit ( dashed line ) . for details see section 4,height=302 ]    for practical uses , it is convenient to express eq.([cp ] ) by a simple algebraic approximation .",
    "thus , it is standard to express the specific heat by a series of powers in @xmath66 , with coefficients empirically adjusted .",
    "three terms , namely @xmath67 are enough to describe the specific heat with an excellent accuracy in the range we are interested in .",
    "this is clearly shown in fig.1 , where we have plotted @xmath29 vs. @xmath66 for @xmath11 .",
    "the continuous line corresponds to the ",
    "exact \" values which have been obtained by plotting ( [ cp ] ) with the insertion of the four characteristic temperatures of vibration as given in ( [ tn ] ) .",
    "the dotted line is the polynomial approximation ( [ cc ] ) , the coefficients being @xmath68 the units of @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are @xmath65 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively .",
    "from fig.1 it is apparent , first , that @xmath29 has a significant change in the range of temperatures of the venus atmosphere , from @xmath74 at @xmath75 to @xmath76 at @xmath77 . even if we restrict our analysis to the lowest layer , i.e. , from @xmath75 to @xmath78 , the interval of temperature is between @xmath79 and @xmath80 . in fig.1 one",
    "first observes that the change in @xmath29 in this interval of temperature is of the order of @xmath81 , and secondly , that this polynomial fit is excellent .",
    "thus , we will use ( [ cc ] ) as input to generalize the vg method and apply it to the atmosphere of venus .",
    "the generalization of the vg method can start from eq.([cr ] ) because it is applicable to any ideal gas . in this section",
    "however , eq.([cri ] ) for the adiabatic transformations , adopts the form @xmath82 @xmath28 being the pressure level of reference and @xmath13 the potential temperature characteristic of this adiabatic trajectory .",
    "we find @xmath83\\ , \\exp\\left[\\frac{c\\,(t^2-{\\theta}^2)}{2\\,r^{\\ast}}\\right].\\ ] ]    ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    in fig.2 , we have adjusted the data of the low atmosphere of venus by means of this formula for an adiabatic .",
    "there is a generalized consensus supporting this behavior as can be read in ref .",
    "it shows an excellent agreement along the lowest @xmath84 and a clear departure for upper heights .    in the present case ,",
    "the physical meaning of the potential temperature is the same as that of ( [ theta ] ) , i.e. the temperature that the gas would take if we compressed or expanded it adiabatically to a pressure @xmath28 .",
    "the price to pay now is that given the coordinates @xmath24 , the value of @xmath13 has to be computed numerically by iterations . of course",
    ", in the case @xmath85 , ( [ theta ] ) and ( [ thetabar ] ) are the same equation",
    ".    the differential expression for the specific entropy of ideal gases was written in ( [ sgi ] ) and now reads @xmath86    for practical purposes , let us define a new magnitude @xmath87 , with physical dimensions of temperature , in the following way : @xmath88 with @xmath89    in fact , this new variable @xmath87,that reduces to the standard temperature as soon as @xmath29 is constant , allows one to treat this problem in exactly the same way as in the case of the ideal perfect gas .    after specifying @xmath90 in a form like ( [ cc ] ) , and by the integration of ( [ cpt ] ) we obtain @xmath91,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and",
    "the result is @xmath92\\right\\}.\\ ] ]    this is the relation between @xmath87 and @xmath66 .",
    "this formula fulfils the two agreed upon conditions : @xmath93 and @xmath94 for @xmath85    using ( [ cpt ] ) in ( [ scpt ] ) @xmath95 and in a similar way to what was done to arrive to ( [ slt ] ) , we obtain @xmath96 with @xmath97 and @xmath98 it is now clear from this result that in an isentropic process , @xmath99 is also conserved",
    ". the use of ( [ stb ] ) will permit us to extend the vg method quite easily , at least from a conceptual point of view .",
    "the formal analogy between these new magnitudes and those appearing in section 2 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , permits us to extend the vg method reviewed in section 3 in a quite natural way .",
    "the entropy , the enthalpy and the l function of an atmospheric column per unit section are : @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104    the condition of maximum @xmath6 , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 constants , is expressed as the extreme of the functional @xmath105 under the variation of the profile @xmath43 , in the following way @xmath106\\,dp + \\lambda\\,\\frac{1}{g}\\,\\int_{p_2}^{p_1}\\,\\delta[h]\\,dp = 0.\\ ] ]        to go into the details of this variational problem , remember that @xmath107 then , the condition @xmath108 ( @xmath109 fixed ) implies that @xmath110 and taking into account that @xmath111 one gets @xmath112    finally , the result of the extreme can be written as @xmath113 with @xmath114 being formally identical to the vg result .",
    "nevertheless , it does not provide an explicit expression of @xmath66 as a function of @xmath109 .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath99 depends on @xmath87 and through it on @xmath66 , so that @xmath115 is now a function of @xmath109 and @xmath66 .",
    "consequently , the equation ( [ res ] ) has to be treated numerically .",
    "in fact , by using the method of lagrange multipliers , the experimental data fix the constraints @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "then , the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath59 are determined in order to satisfy @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the performance of the extended vg method , summarized in eq .",
    "( [ res ] ) , when applied to the atmosphere of venus is shown in fig.3 .",
    "note that the logarithmic scale used for pressure is more sensitive and hence puts more clearly in evidence the virtues or flaws of the fit .",
    "the characteristics of the venus atmosphere allow us to well distinguish three regions in altitude . in each one of these regions",
    "we have applied the extended vg method by maximizing the entropy with both @xmath8 and @xmath9 constraints .    in the lowest one , from @xmath75 to @xmath116",
    ", we found that the value of @xmath59 is @xmath117 and the value of @xmath118 .",
    "this high value of the unique parameter of the model indicates the clear preponderant role of @xmath9 with respect to @xmath8 , as the dominant constraint in the maximization of @xmath6 . from this fact",
    "we conclude that in this layer the profile is adiabatic .",
    "this clearly agrees with the result shown in fig.2 , obtained by means of eq.([thetabar ] ) .    in the layer from @xmath119 to @xmath120 ,",
    "the value obtained for @xmath59 is @xmath121 and @xmath122 this indicates that here @xmath8 is the dominant constraint , and in consequence the profile of this layer is basically isothermal .",
    "the method assigns @xmath123 with @xmath124 to the intermediate layer , a transition region , from @xmath125 to @xmath126 .",
    "our purpose in this paper was to extend the first - principles vg method to atmospheric layers where the thermal deviation is so high that it is not reasonably possible to consider a constant unique value for the specific heat in all the points of the layer . to implement this extension ,",
    "we have had to define a new extended potential temperature , @xmath99 .",
    "a potential temperature is , by definition , a generalized temperature that characterizes adiabatic processes , or in other words , that is conserved in processes where the entropy is constant .",
    "the relation between the new @xmath99 and entropy maintains the same standard form as that existing for ideal - perfect gases .",
    "> from the surface of venus up to about @xmath0 , we have distinguished @xmath127 layers .",
    "the extended vg method , for each layer , after fixing @xmath55 to the corresponding initial temperature of the layer , deals with a unique parameter @xmath59 to adjust the constraints . from the surface up to @xmath1 , the method assigns a high value of @xmath59 .",
    "this implies that the @xmath5 profile here is adiabatic .",
    "there is no surprise in this result ; an adiabatic lapse - rate was detected in the low atmosphere of venus during the first observations of the russian venera probes .",
    "this was verified later in other spatial missions @xcite . in the layer from @xmath128",
    "to @xmath129 in height @xmath59 has an intermediate value that indicates a transition .",
    "finally , from @xmath130 to about @xmath0 , this method produces a low @xmath59 , which is interpreted as an isothermal layer .",
    "this is the first time that the vg method identifies an adiabatic layer where it should ; this concordance shows clearly the success of the method itself and of the extension presented in this paper .",
