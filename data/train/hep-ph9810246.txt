    "the production of soft photons ( energy @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the strong coupling constant ) in a hot quark - gluon plasma at equilibrium has been studied by many groups , using thermal field theory @xcite , or a semi - classical approach as in @xcite . in this talk",
    "i will study the case of soft virtual photon ( with invariant mass @xmath2 ) at two - loop level using the hard thermal loop ( htl ) expansion .",
    "the two loop diagrams are found to be of the same order of magnitude as the one loop result .",
    "this unexpected result solves the problem of the absence of bremsstrahlung in the htl expansion , while bremsstrahlung seems to contribute dominantly when using the semi - classical approach @xcite .",
    "the starting point will be the bare thermal field theory . the imaginary part of the photon polarization which is proportional to the invariant dilepton production rate is found to be : @xmath3 the additional power of @xmath4 in @xmath5 arises from the fact that the soft photon is produced by annihilation of a soft quark - antiquark pair ( each of momentum @xmath6 ) . other processes such as @xmath7 are not allowed since the quark is massless . having a soft momentum scale , the htl expansion @xcite demands the use of effective vertices and propagators .",
    "the soft virtual photon production was one of the first applications of the htl resummation scheme @xcite : the authors of @xcite have calculated the imaginary part of the one loop diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig:1loop ] . in fig .",

    "a few remarks are worth saying about this result : + @xmath10 the htl is built to handle soft momentum problems ; in the hard momentum limit , it tells that we recover the bare theory which is _ a priori _ what one needs in _ most _ cases .",
    "for example if we take a fermion with momentum @xmath11 , the inverse of its effective propagator is given by the sum of the inverse bare propagator ( @xmath12 ) and the one - loop correction as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : self ] : to evaluate this correction one should apply the htl approximation . thus in the one - loop correction in fig .  [",
    "fig : self ] we use @xmath13 , which is justified if @xmath11 is soft and the loop momentum @xmath14 is hard , but when @xmath11 becomes hard this approximation is no more correct , then the htl estimate of the one - loop correction of the effective propagator is incomplete in the hard momentum limit .    @xmath10 the processes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1loop ] come from one loop corrections to the bare vertices and propagators . on the other hand the integral @xmath15 in eq .",
    "[ eq:1loop ] , indicates that the quark momentum runs from a soft scale ( @xmath16 ) to a hard scale ( @xmath17 ) , _ i.e. _ we need the hard limit of the one loop correction which is incomplete in the htl approximation as we mentioned before .",
    "+ @xmath10 the importance of processes coming from cut [ a ] in fig  [ fig:1loop ] can be understood from the result of cleymans et al @xcite , where they calculated bremsstrahlung photon production ( fig .  [",
    "fig : brem ] ) using a semi classical approach : their result yields @xmath18 which is of the same order as eq .",
    "[ eq : bare ] and eq .",
    "[ eq:1loop ] .    @xmath10 the bremsstrahlung photon production ( fig .",
    "[ fig : brem ] ) is mediated by the gluon exchange , while that of cut [ a ] of fig .",
    "[ fig:1loop ] is mediated by the exchange of quark , and it is reasonable to think that a complete calculation should include both processes . the natural question that arises is : how can one reconcile bremsstrahlung with the htl scheme ?",
    "the solution to the problems mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sect : motive ] comes when one looks at 2-loop diagrams in the htl expansion . in two loop diagrams we have more powers of @xmath4 , coming from the @xmath19 vertices ,",
    "then to compensate additional powers of @xmath4 which may come from the phase space we have to have a hard phase space . in the catalogue of 2-loop diagrams",
    "we skip those which contain vertices with no bare analogue : these vertices turn out to be negligible when one of the vertex lines becomes hard .",
    "the remaining diagrams are shown in fig .  [ fig:2loops ] .",
    "as discussed in f. gelis s talk @xcite , calculating two loop diagrams in the htl expansion , one should pay attention to the counterterms in order to avoid double - counting ( see also @xcite for more details . ) .",
    "we explore the case where all the quark momenta are hard .",
    "assuming hard quark momentum we can replace the effective vertices by the bare ones , and take the bare propagator for the quark . the simplified version of fig .",

    "[ fig:2loopsimple ] . in the same figure",
    "we have depicted the relevant cuts that enable one to calculate the corresponding contribution in the framework of the thermal cutting rules .    in what follows",
    "we will take the photon to be static _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath20 . for virtual photon",
    "the production rate per unit time and per unit volume is related to the imaginary part of the retarded polarization tensor of the photon as @xcite : @xmath21 the gluon propagator appears linearly in @xmath22 , then we can write : @xmath23 where @xmath14 is the momentum flow through the gluon .",
    "+ such separation is motivated by the fact that regions @xmath24 and @xmath25 contain different physical processes . while @xmath24 gives bremsstrahlung of fig .",
    "[ fig : brem ] , which is a possible candidate to reconcile bremsstrahlung with the htl expansion , @xmath25 gives annihilation and compton scattering .",
    "bremsstrahlung is a new process , then we can guarantee that it will give a positive contribution that should be added to the one - loop result",
    ". moreover we can apply different approximations in each of these regions .",
    "we can treat each region separately and at the end we add the two contributions . in the next sections we will discuss in detail the region @xmath24 , while we will give some indicative results for @xmath25 .",
    "the matrix element @xmath26 of diagrams [ a ] and [ b ] of fig .",
    "[ fig:2loopsimple ] , can be written as ( see @xcite for the complete expression ) : @xmath27 writing @xmath26 in this form exhibits some of the terms that are absent at one loop level in the htl expansion . indeed the gluon appearing in the effective propagator and vertices in the one loop diagram are taken to be light - like ( @xmath28 ) by construction of the htl resummation scheme , then @xmath29 will be a pure 2-loop contribution .",
    "we can obtain analytically the leading logarithmic behavior in @xmath30 of @xmath22 at 2-loop order . by momentum power counting",
    "we can isolate the term which gives the logarithm : it happens that this term comes from @xmath29 , enforcing the previous expectation that bremsstrahlung contribution is a pure two loop contribution .",
    "+ the contribution of this leading term can be written schematically as : @xmath31 * comments : * + @xmath10 a is a constant that depends on the color factors , and it has no @xmath4 dependence . + @xmath10 @xmath32 comes from the @xmath33 couplings .",
    "+ @xmath10 @xmath34 comes from the @xmath19 couplings .",
    "+ @xmath10 @xmath35 comes from the uncut quark - propagator denominators , for example the momentum @xmath36 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2loopsimple ] can be approximated by : @xmath37 .",
    "+ @xmath10 the soft gluon thermal mass @xmath38/9 $ ] , comes from the gluon spectral density .",
    "+ @xmath10 the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath17 is provided by the statistical weights .",
    "+ @xmath10 the integral @xmath39 indicates the hard @xmath40 behavior .",
    "+ @xmath10 @xmath41 is a function of dimension one .",
    "this function depends on both @xmath42 which appears as a kinematical infrared cut - off in the integral over @xmath43 and @xmath44 which appears in the gluon spectral density and can also play the role of an infrared cut - off for the same integral .",
    "+ @xmath10 the integral @xmath45 points out that @xmath46 vary between a soft scale ( @xmath47 ) and a hard scale ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "+ the cutoff @xmath48 can be simplified by taking @xmath49 , then the larger cutoff @xmath50 will be the relevant cutoff .",
    "after this simplification we get : @xmath51    the production rate is then given by : @xmath52 where the sum runs over the flavor of the quarks in the loop ( @xmath53 is the electric charge of the quark of flavor @xmath48 , in units of the electron electric charge ) . + numerical estimates of the unapproximated expression of @xmath22 verify that the condition @xmath54 is only a _ technical _ condition as we get a reasonable accuracy even for @xmath55 . on",

    "[ fig:1loop]-[a ] . applying the same approximation we did in sect .",

    "[ eq : staticfinal ] .",
    "this reflects the different nature of both results , an exchanged fermion in the first , and an exchanged gluon in the second . *",
    "comparing the two results we obtain the ratio : @xmath61 which for 2 light flavors and 3 colors becomes @xmath62 this ratio is rather large , which means that bremsstrahlung is definitely an essential contribution to the soft static photon production rate by a hot plasma .",
    "we return to the semi - classical treatment used in @xcite . in their approach",
    "they took into account the effect of multiple scattering of the quark in the plasma . to compare the two loop result with",
    "their result one need to  undo \" the effect of rescattering and consider only one collision of the quark in the plasma .",
    "we apply the same simplification as they did _",
    "i.e. _ :    * the scattering of the particles is treated as in vacuum ( the dynamics ) , while the plasma effects are introduced for the kinematics only . *",
    "the energy of the quarks or gluons is much larger than the temperature so that boltzman distributions are used for particles entering the interaction region and a factor 1 is assigned to those leaving it . as a by - product",
    "one can neglect the photon momentum compared to the momenta of the constituents in the plasma . * to screen the forward singularity they introduced a phenomenological debye mass @xmath63 , which we will take to be @xmath50 when we compare their result with eq .",
    "[ eq : staticfinal ] .    applying the above approximations we get for the production rate of the lepton pair at rest the following expression : @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the degeneneracy factors introduced in @xcite .",

    "[ eq : semic ] we see that the semi - classical approach give the same spectrum in @xmath57 as expected .",

    "[ eq : staticfinal ] we find for two flavors : @xmath67 _",
    "i.e.  _ the semi - classical over - estimates the rate of production by about @xmath68 .",
    "this difference appears to come from the various approximations they used .",
    "in this section we give partial results for the @xmath25 case @xcite and the arguments that we will give are based on the leading logarithmic behavior only .",
    "+ the basic physical processes for @xmath25 are compton and annihilation , then naively we expect double counting with the one loop diagram , in the region where the imaginary part of the one loop diagram gives similar processes ( fig .  [ fig:1loop]-[b ] ) . to cure this problem of double counting",
    ", we have to calculate the counterterms depicted on the right of fig .  [ fig:2loops ] . indeed ,",
    "when the gluon in the loop becomes hard , we have a hard loop that reproduce what is already included in the one - loop diagram via the effective vertices and propagators .",
    "+ the structure of @xmath22 allows to decompose it as the sum of two pieces , one part reflecting the hard gluon momentum behavior ( @xmath69 ) where we can apply the hard @xmath14 approximation , and the other reflecting the hard fermion behavior ( @xmath70 ) : @xmath71      by isolating hard @xmath14 terms we apply indirectly the htl approximation , then one may expect a fair compensation between @xmath69 and the counterterms .",
    "@xmath69 reveals soft @xmath40 sensitivity , which means that it is no more allowed to use the bare propagator for the quark , thus we have to use the effective one . at",
    "leading logarithm order we can take a constant mass for the quark which will be the asymptotic quark thermal mass which is twice the soft quark thermal mass @xmath72 .",

    "moreover the two - loop diagrams give rise to new physical processes which do not appear at one loop . using the method of counterterms we give an explicit way to calculate higher loop diagrams using the htl expansion .",
    "there exists other methods in the literature , such as using a cutoff @xcite in order to obtain the correct behavior of the effective propagator in the hard momentum limit and to avoid possible double counting.finally adding the contributions coming from @xmath25 and @xmath24 the virtual photon production rate in the _ plasma _ is increased considerably which may have remarkable experimental effects .",
