    "unfortunately , till now it is impossible to resolve microimages , however in this case there is a chance to observe temporal variations of observed fluxes , or so called photometric microlensing .    in principle",
    "the gravitational lens effect is achromatic , but sizes and locations for different spectral bands could be different and in this case we could observe chromatic effect @xcite .",
    "astrometric microlensing was discussed in number of papers @xcite , but actually that is signature of well - known light bending in the gravitational field and at the first time light bending by gravitational field was discussed by @xcite , the first published derivation of light bending for light was given by @xcite in the framework of newtonian theory of gravitation . in the framework of general relativity light bending",
    "was calculated by @xcite and his prediction was confirmed in 1919 @xcite .",
    "actually such an astrometric displacement of distant image due to light bending by gravitational field of microlenses is called astrometric microlensing and the effect could be detectable with optical astrometric mission like sim ( space interferometry mission , see http://sim.jpl.nasa.gov ) , gaia ( global astrometric interferometer for astrophysics , see http://sci.esa.int/gaia ) and radio projects like vera ( vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ) and radioastron .",

    "a distance between source and an observer is @xmath7 , a distance between a gravitational lens and observer is @xmath8 , a distance between a gravitational lens and a source is @xmath9 .",

    "[ mic10 ]    let us present rough estimates of an optical depth for astrometric microlensing using estimates for classic microlensing given by macho and eros collaborations @xmath26 .",
    "since image displacement for classic microlensing is about @xmath27 , then an optical depth to have displacement @xmath28 and @xmath29 is given by the expression @xmath30 so , for @xmath31 an optical depth is about @xmath32 and for @xmath33 it is about @xmath34 , and since according to last estimates @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "an optical depth for classical microlensing toward galactic bulge is about @xmath36 @xcite , thus an optical depth for astrometric microlensing is higher .",

    "according to the schedule of the russian space agency the space radio telescope radioastron will be launched in the next few years ( see description of the project @xcite ) .",
    "this project was initiated by astro space center ( asc ) of the lebedev physical institute of the russian academy of sciences ( ras ) in collaboration with other institutions of ras and russian space agency .",
    "scientists from 20 countries develop the scientific payload for the satellite and will provide a ground base support of the mission .",
    "the project was approved by ras and russian space agency .",
    "this space based 10-meter radio telescope will be used for space  ground vlbi measurements . for observations",
    "four wavelength bands will be used corresponding to @xmath44  cm , @xmath45  cm , @xmath46  cm , @xmath47  cm .",
    "it will be not the first attempt to build a telescope with a size larger than the earth size . in 1997 institute of space and technology of japan",
    "launched a halca satellite with 8 m radio telescope and as a result vlbi space observatory programme ( vsop ) was formed @xcite . since the apogee height for radiotelescope halca was 21,200  km , the apogee height for radioastron should about 350,000  km ( or even @xmath48  km see below ) , and as a result the fringe size for the minimal wavelength will be smaller than 1 - 10@xmath49 . the minimal correlated flux for space - ground vlbi should be about 100 mjy for the 1.35  cm wavelength at 8@xmath50 level @xcite ,",
    "therefore source fluxes should be higher than the threshold and about 24 mjy for the 6  cm wavelength .",
    "an orbit for the satellite was chosen with high apogee and with period of satellite rotation around the earth 9.5 days , which evolves as a result of weak gravitational perturbations from the moon and the sun .",
    "the perigee is in a band from 10 to 70 thousand kilometers , the apogee is a band from 310 to 390 thousand kilometers .",
    "the basic orbit parameters will be the following : the orbital period is p = 9.5 days , the semi - major axis is a = 189 000 km , the eccentricity is e = 0.853 , the perigee is h = 29 000 km .",
    "a detailed calculation of the high - apogee evolving orbit can be done if the exact time of launch is known .",
    "after several years of observations , it would be possible to move the spacecraft to a much higher orbit ( with apogee radius about @xmath51  km ) , by additional spacecraft maneuver using gravitational force of the moon . in this case",
    "it would be necessary to use 64 - 70  m antennas for the spacecraft control , synchronizations and telemetry .",
    "the fringe sizes ( in micro arc seconds ) for the apogee of the above - mentioned orbit and for all radioastron bands are given in table [ tabl1 ] .",
    ".the fringe sizes ( in micro arc seconds ) for the standard and advanced apogees @xmath52 ( 350 000 and 3 200 000  km correspondingly ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tabl1 ]    thus , there are non - negligible chances to observe mirages ( shadows ) around the black hole at the galactic center and in nearby agns in the radio - band using radioastron facilities @xcite .",
    "if microlenses are located in our galaxy , recent observations by macho , eros , ogle collaborations ( and their theoretical interpretations ) showed that an optical depth for galactic microlens is about @xmath53 . in spite of the fact that for a selected source a probability for microlensing is very small and for the discovery one could monitor about @xmath54 background sources ( like for microlensing in our galaxy ) .",
    "that is a hard problem because we have not enough background point - like distant sources , however an angular distance between images is about @xmath55 arcsec , therefore there is a possibility to resolve point - like quasar images with vlbi technique in radio bands , but unfortunately a sample of bright extragalactic sources is small to realize the program ( there is also a chance to resolve the stellar images in ir band with the modern optical telescopes @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown that an optical depth for microlenses located in halo or ( and ) in quasar bulge is low @xcite .",
    "we will not study the case because of the optical depth is low but also angular distance between images is much shorter than the radioastron fringe size .",
    "let us consider cosmologically distributed microlenses since there is a hypothesis that variability of essential fraction of distant quasars is caused by microlensing .",
    "if it is , one can say that a probability ( an optical depth ) is high in radio band also .    to evaluate an optical depth",
    "we will assume that a source is located at a distance with cosmological redshift @xmath56 .",
    "calculations for different parameters are given by @xcite .",
    "we will remind of the results . in calculations we used point - like source approximation ( it means that as a result we obtain an upper limit for an optical depth ) .",
    "an optical depth could be evaluated using approximations given by @xcite @xmath57\\lambda(w ) }         { \\sqrt{\\omega_0(1+w)^3+\\omega_\\lambda } } ,         \\label{eq_cosmol2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is compact lens density ( in critical density units ) , @xmath59 is matter density , @xmath60 is a @xmath61-term density ( or quintessence ) , @xmath62 is an affine parameter ( in @xmath63 units ) .",
    "we use realistic cosmological parameters to evaluate integral ( [ eq_cosmol2 ] ) .",
    "observations of cosmological sn ia and cmb anisotropy give the following parameters @xmath64 ( or so - called concordance model parameters ) .",
    "for example , recent observations of the wmap team gives for the best fit @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) could be adopted as realistic , if we assume that almost all baryonic matter form microlenses ( @xmath67 ) , or 20% baryonic matter forms microlenses ( @xmath68 ) ) .",
    "however , for @xmath69 optical depth could be about @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "if about 30% non - baryonic dark matter forms cosmologically distributed objects with stellar masses ( such as neutralino stars suggested by @xcite , parameter @xmath71 could be adopted as realistic and in this case an optical depth could be about @xmath72 . therefore ,",
    "if 25% of baryonic matter form cosmologically distributed microlenses one could say that the hawkins s hypothesis that microlensing cause variability for essential fraction of all quasars should be ruled out , but in the case when 30% of non - baryonic dark matter form microlenses about 10% of distant quasars demonstrate these features .",
    "more than 10 years ago @xcite put forward the idea that nearly all quasars are being microlensed ( however , based on photometric observations of sample about 25,000 quasars , @xcite claimed that microlensing model for an explanation of variabilities is unlikely ) .",
    "as previous estimates show us that in the case if hawkins hypothesis is correct , @xmath58 should be about 1 and that is a contradiction for data of observational cosmology , but hys hypothesis could be correct in part and if observations would dictate that @xmath58 is larger than 0.05 we could conclude that non - baryonic matter form microlenses ( they could be neutralino clouds or primordial black holes ) .",
    "if the hawkins hypothesis is correct in part at least , in this case also an essential fraction of distant point like sources should demonstrate features of microlensing since the optical depth could be evaluated by eq .",
    "( [ eq_cosmol2 ] ) as well .",
    "no doubt that except microlensing there are other causes of variabilities , however one could use different techniques to separate different types of variabilities ( see , @xcite , for example ) , since there is different dependence of modulation indices as a function of frequency for oscillations ( scintillations ) and for microlensing .",
    "however , resolving the microimages and measuring the centroid displacements for bright point - like sources in radio band will be a critical test to prove ( or rule out ) the hawkins hypothesis about microlensing for point like sources at cosmological distances .    to prove the microlensing hypothesis for a distant quasar , the source have to have the following properties from a list of perspective targets of vsop or radioastron missions ( or from its extended version ) : + a )",
    "a source should demonstrate signatures of microlensing which are different from typical features for scintillations at time scales @xmath73 35 years ( that is an estimated time of radioastron mission ) ; + b ) a compact core for the source should have size @xmath74 and flux density should be higher than radioastron thresholds @xmath75 mjy at 6  cm wavelength and @xmath76 mjy at at 1.35  cm wavelength .    in the case",
    ", if the hawkins hypothesis is correct an essential fraction of all point like sources at cosmological distances should demonstrate signatures of photometric and therefore astrometric microlensing .    in the case , if the hawkins hypothesis is incorrect and cosmologically distributed microlenses give a small contribution into critical density @xmath77 , but even for this case one could evaluate @xmath58 from an observed rate of microlensed sources satisfying condition b ) , since the observed rate gives an estimate for the optical depth .    according to @xcite results about @xmath78 of sources ( from 344 ones )",
    "have core size @xmath79 and the angle corresponds to the fringe size at the 6  cm wavelength .",
    "this part of sources could be used for photometric monitoring and for a further analysis of a preferable explanation of variability .",
    "if the analysis would indicate that microlensing is a preferable cause of variability the candidate could be selected as the first order one .",
    "but even in the case , if a source would demonstrate variability that could be explained by another cause ( but not by microlensing ) , the source should be checked to search for image splitting or ( and ) astrometric image displacement since models for alternative explanation of variabilities could be not quit correct .    from theoretical point of view there is a possibility to detect microlensing for both core and bright knots . in this case",
    "the two situations will be characterized by different time scales .",
    "few years ago , @xcite claimed that the most realistic explanation of short - term variability of a gravitational lens class b1600 + 434 at 5  ghz and 8.5  ghz ( variabilities and possible explanations of the phenomena were discussed by @xcite ) .",
    "the authors considered different cases of variability such as scintillation due to scattering and microlensing . as a result they concluded , that microlensing phenomenon in radio band gives the natural fit for observational data .",
    "one could remind flux densities changed from 58(48 ) mjy in march 1994 to 29 ( 24 ) mjy in august 1995 for image a(b ) @xcite .",
    "another decrease was found from 27(24 ) to 23(19 ) mjy and it was from february to october 1998 @xcite .",
    "strong variability was detected at 5  ghz , where flux density was about 3437 mjy in 1987 @xcite , but it was about 45(37 ) mjy for image a(b ) @xcite and only 23 ( 18 ) mjy in june 1999 @xcite .",
    "based on analysis of variabilities @xcite concluded that the variability is caused by superluminal motion of compact knots in jet ( vlba and 100-m effelsberg telescope observations also found evidences for jet components in the class gravitational lens b0128 + 437 @xcite , but unfortunately their flux densities are too low to observe then with the radioastron interferometer ) .",
    "let us remind that a typical threshold for radioastron interferometer sensitivity at 5  ghz is about 23 mjy with an integration time 300  s @xcite , therefore in principle , such density fluxes could be detected by radioastron interferometer .",
    "@xcite concluded that for photometric fluctuations @xmath80  mag typical astrometric displacement should be about 20  40  @xmath49 ( to evaluate photometric and astrometric microlensing one could use numerical approaches and analytical asymptotical expansions near fold @xcite and cusp singularities @xcite . in principle",
    "such a displacement could be observed with radioastron space interferometer at 6  cm and 1.35  cm wavelengths if flux densities for the object is high enough .",
    "for example , in the b1600 + 434 case the density flux is suitable for the core ( at least , at 6  cm wavelength ) , but if the superluminal motion of knots is responsible for microlensing ( as @xcite claimed ) the sensitivity of radioastron should be improved in 10 times at 6  cm wavelength to observe such a displacement of knots . at the 1.35  cm wavelength",
    "the radioastron flux density threshold is probably too high to detect the displacement .",
    "let us remind that according to the standard model typical time scales for radio microlensing could be much smaller than typical time scale in optical band due to effects of special relativity and different geometry and locations of radiating regions in these bands , for example typical time scales in optical band are determined by a transverse velocity ( @xmath81 ) , but in radioband time scales could be in @xmath82 times smaller @xcite ( all velocity are expressed in @xmath83 units ) .",
    "typical time scales is determined by a ratio typical sizes between caustics and an apparent velocity of the jet - component in the source plane @xcite .",
    "if jet - component moves with a relativistic bulk velocity @xmath84 , then an apparent velocity @xmath85 is @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the angle between the jet and a line of sight @xcite .",
    "the apparent angular velocity of the jet component is @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the source redshift and the angular diameter distance to the stationary core , respectively . using the estimate for observed source redshift @xmath89 @xcite",
    ", @xcite concluded that angular velocity of b1600 + 434 should be @xmath91 for a flat friedmann universe with @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "based on observational data and simulations @xcite evaluated also a typical size of knots in jet in the source plane @xmath94 and an apparent velocity band @xmath95 . therefore , apparent displacements for b1600 + 434 should be about about dozens @xmath49 and the displacement could be measured with the radioastron interferometer at 6  cm wavelength .",
    "one could also evaluate linear sizes of knots through their angular diameter distances @xmath96}{1+z_s } , \\label{eq_time_new_3a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 ( for a flat universe and @xmath98 ) , therefore typical linear sizes of the knots should be @xmath99  cm .",
    "typical scales for microlensing are discussed not only in books on gravitational lensing ( schneider et al . 1992 , petters et al . 2001 ) , but in recent papers also ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "usually people discuss locations of microlenses in gravitational macrolenses because of an optical depth for microlensing is the highest in comparison with other possible locations of gravitational microlenses , but it is clear that the fact it was known quit well in advance .",
    "however , cases for microlens locations were considered , for example galactic clusters or extragalactic dark halos could have microlenses .",
    "so , for example following to a recent paper by @xcite , we remind that typical length scale for microlensing and assuming concordance cosmological model parameters ( @xmath100 ) @xmath101 where `` typical '' microlens and sources redshifts are assumed to be @xmath102 ( similar to @xcite ) , @xmath103 is the schwarzschild radius corresponding to microlens mass @xmath104 , @xmath105 is the dimensionless hubble constant .",
    "the corresponding angular scale is @xcite @xmath106    using the length scale ( [ eq_suppl1 ] ) and a velocity scale ( say an apparent velocity @xmath107 ) , one could calculate the standard time scale corresponding to the scale to cross the einstein radius @xmath108 here we assume time scales are determined by an apparent velocity or a typical transverse velocity ( @xmath109 ) , respectively .",
    "the time scale @xmath110 corresponding to the approximation of a point mass lens and small size of source in comparison with einstein  chwolson radius and probably the approximation and the time scale could be used if microlenses are distributed freely at cosmological distances and actually one einstein ",
    "chwolson angle is located far enough from another one .    if we use the simple caustic microlens model ( like the straight fold caustic model ) , there are two time scales , namely it depends on sizes of `` caustic size '' and source radius @xmath111 .",
    "if the source radius is larger or about `` caustic size '' @xmath112 ( if we use the following approximation for the magnification near the caustic @xmath113 ( @xmath114 and @xmath24 is the perpendicular direction to the fold caustic ) ) , thus @xmath115 , then the relevant time scale is the `` crossing caustic time '' @xcite @xmath116 ( in the right hand side @xmath117 and @xmath118 correspond to @xmath119 and @xmath120 respectively and @xmath121  cm ) .    however , if the source radius @xmath122 is much smaller than the `` caustic size '' @xmath112 @xmath123 , one could used the `` caustic time '' , namely the time when the source is located in the area near the caustic and the time scale corresponds to @xmath124 where @xmath125  cm",
    ".    these time scales @xmath126 and @xmath127 could be about days ( or even hours ) if @xmath128 is determined by an apparent motion of superluminal motion in jet .",
    "thus @xmath126 could be used as a lower limit for typical time scales for the simple caustic microlens model , but since there are two length parameters in the problem and in general we do not know their values , we could not evaluate @xmath122 only from the time scales of microlensing because time scales could correspond to two different length scales .",
    "however , if we take into account variation amplitudes of luminosity , one could say that in general @xmath126 corresponds to to smaller variation amplitudes than @xmath127 , because if the source square is large there is a `` smoothness '' effect since only small fraction of source square is located in the high amplification region near the caustic .",
    "first , one could point out that gravitational lensed systems are the most perspective objects to search for microlensing .",
    "astrometric microlensing could be detected in the gravitational lens system such as b1600 + 434 in the case if a proper motion of source , lens and an observer are generated mostly by a superluminal motion of knots in jet ( superluminal motion in jet was found with halca in the quasar pks  1622 - 297 @xcite ) .",
    "but in this case , based on density flux estimates done by @xcite , one could say that a required sensitivity of the radioastron interferometer should be improved in 10 times .    in the case",
    "if there is microlensing of core in the b1600 + 434 system for example , then astrometric microlensing in the system could be about should be about 20  40  @xmath49 @xcite and the radioastron interferometer will have enough sensitivity to detect such an astrometric displacement .",
    "second , in principle microlensing for distant sources could be the only tool to evaluate @xmath58 from microlensing event rate . to solve this problem with the radioastron interferometer",
    "one should analyze variabilities of compact sources with a core size @xmath129 and with high enough flux densities about @xmath75 mjy at 6  cm wavelength and about @xmath76 mjy at at 1.35  cm wavelength to fit the most reliable model for variabilities of the sources such as scintillations , microlensing etc . a fraction of the sources in the list of extragalactic targets for vsop and radioastron about 13%  14 % @xcite . in the case ,",
    "if the analysis would indicate that other explanations ( such as scintillations ) are preferable and future observations with radioastron interferometer would show that the are no features for astrometric microlensing , one could conclude that hawkins hypothesis should be ruled out .",
    "but if an essential fraction of variability could be fitted by microlensing , the sources could be as the first order candidate to search for astrometric microlensing .",
    "therefore , one could say that astrometric microlensing ( or direct image resolution with radioastron interferometer ) is the crucial test to confirm ( or rule out ) microlens hypothesis for gravitational lensed systems and for point like distant objects .",
    "astrometric microlensing due to macho action in our galaxy is not very important for observations with the space interferometer radioastron , since first , probabilities are not high ; second , typical time scales are longer than estimated life time of the radioastron space mission .    therefore , just after the radioastron launch it will be the first chance to detect microlensing by a direct way .",
    "so , the main goal of the paper to attract an attention to such a challenging possibility because , preflight time is very short now and perspective targets should be analyzed carefully by observational and theoretical ways in advance .",
    "a number of point like bright sources at cosmological distances and gravitational lensed systems with point like components demonstrating microlens signatures is not very high and the sources should be analyzed by the careful way to search for candidates where microlens model is preferable in comparison with alternative explanations of variabilities .",

    "<S> the basic targets for microlensing searches should be bright point - like radio sources at cosmological distances . in this case , an analysis of their variability and a solid determination of microlensing could lead to an estimation of their cosmological mass density , moreover , in this case one could not exclude a possibility that non - baryonic dark matter also form microlenses if the corresponding optical depth will be high enough . to search for microlensing the most perspective objects are gravitational lensed systems as usually , like class gravitational lens b1600 + 434 , for instance </S>",
    "<S> . however , for direct resolving these images and direct detection of apparent motion of the knots , a radioastron sensitivity have to be improved , since an estimated flux density is too low and to observe the phenomena one should improve sensitivity in 10 times at 6  cm wavelength , for instance , otherwise , it is necessary to increase an integration time ( assuming that a radio source has a typical core  </S>",
