    "molecules can not be directly cooled using the laser cooling techniques that led to bose - einstein condensation of alkali atoms because of the complex rotational - vibrational spectrum of the molecules . as a result ,",
    "two - color raman photoassociation and feshbach resonances have emerged as tools to create translationally cold molecules starting from ultra - cold atomic gases .",
    "the conversion of a macroscopic number of quantum degenerate atoms into molecular dimers starting from either a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite or a fermi gas @xcite has been observed by several experimental groups using feshbach resonances .",
    "this work culminated in the formation of a molecular bose - einstein condensate ( mbec ) @xcite .",
    "although feshbach resonances have been the most successful tool for creating quantum degenerate gases of molecules , experiments have demonstrated that two - color raman photoassociation can also be used to create molecules in the electronic ground state @xcite .",
    "two - color photoassociation has the added benefit that the frequency difference between the two optical fields can be used to select a particular rotational - vibrational state @xcite .",
    "this gives photoassociation a potential advantage over feshbach resonances since photoassociation can be used to prepare molecules in their rotational - vibrational ground state . while the molecules created via a feshbach resonance are translationally very cold , they are vibrationally very hot and can decay to lower lying vibrational states via exoergic inelastic collisions with atoms or other molecules . for an atomic bec ,",
    "the molecular two - body decay rates are of the order @xmath0 , which gives a lifetime of @xmath1 for typical atomic densities @xcite .    from the perspective of atom optics ,",
    "the conversion of atoms into molecules via a feshbach resonance or photoassociation is the matter - wave analog of second harmonic generation of photons in a nonlinear crystal with a @xmath2 susceptibility , which has been used to create entangled photon states .",
    "recent experiments have shown the phase coherent and momentum conserving nature of matter - wave second harmonic generation @xcite .",
    "however , implicit in these analogies to nonlinear optics is that the coupling strength between atoms and molecules is not itself a quantum field .",
    "here we address the issue of two - photon raman photoassociation of an atomic bec inside of an optical cavity . in this case",
    "one of the optical fields used to induce the atom - molecule conversion is a quantized mode of a driven optical resonator while the other field is a laser with sufficient intensity to be treated as a classical undepleted pump .",
    "this is reminiscent of early work done by moore and meystre @xcite studying the coupling of a zero momentum bec atoms to atoms with momentum @xmath3 due to a raman transition involving a quantized ring cavity mode and classical pump . unlike their system , our model involves the interaction of four particles : two atoms are destroyed and a molecule and cavity photon are created and vice versa .",
    "consequently , the atom - molecule - cavity interaction is analogous to @xmath4 susceptibility in nonlinear optics , which is known to give rise to four - wave mixing .",
    "coherent photoassociation inside of cavity therefore offers the prospect of novel nonlinear dynamics between the atomic , molecular , and cavity fields as well as the possibility to entangle individual photons with completely different chemical compounds- atoms and molecular dimers .",
    "in fact , only a few papers have previously considered photoassociation inside of a cavity @xcite . however , unlike our model , theirs was based on single photon photoassociation , which is impractical for observing coherent atom - molecule dynamics because the molecules created are in electronic excited states and can rapidly decay due to spontaneous emission .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite employed a positive - p distribution originally developed by gardiner and drummond @xcite to analyze the quantum mechanicial phase space dynamics of the three coupled bosonic fields .",
    "since their interaction hamiltonian required the absorption of a photon to create a molecule , the equation of motion for the p - distribution involved third order derivatives .",
    "such derivatives meant that the resulting equations of motion could not be identified as a fokker - planck equation , which can be readily solved using standard techniques @xcite . as we will show here",
    ", raman photoassociation in which a cavity photon is created along with the molecule leads to an equation of motion for the p - distribution involving only first and second derivatives that is in the form of a fokker - planck equation .",
    "consequently , intracavity raman photoassociation leads not only to more stable molecules but also equations of motion for quasi - phase space distributions that are more easily solved using known techniques .    here",
    ", we analyze the semiclassical behavior for the atomic , molecular , and cavity mean fields .",
    "our goal is to explore the stationary solutions of the coupled nonlinear mean field equations as well as the stability conditions for these solutions in terms of experimentally controllable parameters .",
    "when the cavity is only weakly driven by an external source , the stationary intracavity field remains close to zero while the molecules exhibit a saddle point bifurcation in the molecule number ( or equivalently , atoms due to number conservation ) . below a critical driving amplitude",
    ", there exists both unstable and stable stationary solutions while above the critical point there are no stationary solutions but instead only nonlinear rabi oscillations . for strong cavity driving ,",
    "the system exhibits bistability in the number of molecules .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we present our model for cavity assisted photoassociation and derive the equation of motion for the positive - p representation . from the resulting fokker - planck equation we obtain equations of motions for the expectation values of the fields . in section iii , we analyze the solutions of these mean - field equations . in section iv , we discuss the implications of our results .",
    "we imagine that we start with a bec of atoms inside of an optical cavity , as depicted in fig .",
    "the atoms as well as the molecules formed from them can be trapped inside of the cavity using a far - off resonant optical trap similar to what has been recently demonstrated with single atoms in a cavity @xcite . at temperatures @xmath5",
    ", we can assume that all of the atoms are in the ground state of the trapping potential with wave function @xmath6 .",
    "additionally , the atoms are assumed to have all been prepared in the same hyperfine state denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "pairs of atoms in @xmath7 are coupled to electronically excited molecular states @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the vibrational state of the molecule , via a pump laser with rabi frequency @xmath10 and frequency @xmath11 .",

    "emission of a photon into the cavity mode takes a molecule from an excited state to its electronic ground state .",
    "coupling to a single mode can be achieved by insuring that only a single cavity mode is close to two - photon resonance for the atom - molecule raman transition and by positioning the atoms and molecules around an antinode of the cavity field .",
    "the discrete mode structure of the cavity allows one to select a particular vibrational state in the electronic ground - state manifold of the molecules provided the cavity linewidth , @xmath15 , is less than the vibrational level spacing , which is on the order of @xmath17ghz @xcite . this would imply a cavity q - factor of @xmath18 , which has already been achieved with individual atoms trapped inside of a fabrey - perot resonator@xcite .",
    "the cavity field frequency is @xmath19 and the vacuum rabi frequency for the latexmath:[$|i_{\\nu}\\rangle \\rightarrow    a cavity mode offers a distinct advantage over using free space spontaneous emission to populate the electronic ground state of the molecules , since spontaneous emission would populate a large number of vibrational levels of the ground state as well as leading to dissociation back into the continuum @xcite .",
    "this selectivity along with the enhanced emission rate in a cavity due to the purcell effect in the weak coupling regime was proposed as a possible matter wave amplifier for molecules @xcite .",
    "the internal energies of states @xmath8 and @xmath12 relative to pairs of atoms in @xmath7 are @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the detuning between the excited states and the pump and cavity fields satisfy , @xmath23 is the lifetime of @xmath8 due to spontaneous emission . under these conditions",
    "the excited state can be adiabatically eliminated , leading to two - photon raman transitions between @xmath7 and @xmath12 with rabi frequency @xmath24 under the assumption that the cavity mode @xmath25 and @xmath26 are essentially constant over the spatial extent of the internuclear wave functions for the molecules and colliding atoms @xcite .",
    "@xmath27 are the frank - condon factors for the @xmath28 transitions .    at zero temperature",
    "we can use a single - mode approximation for the molecular field as well as for the atoms . the ground state wave function for the center of mass of the molecules",
    "is denoted by @xmath29 .",
    "this approximation for the atomic and molecular field should remain valid at least for times long enough to observe dynamics lasting several rabi periods .",
    "for longer times , one can expect that some molecules and atoms will be created with excited state wave function @xcite .",

    "the terms proportional to @xmath39 and @xmath40 represent the two body interactions between pairs of atoms and pairs of molecules , respectively .",

    "since the total number of particles is conserved , we are dealing with eigenstates of @xmath45 and the atom - molecule interaction can be absorbed into a redefinition of the atom - atom and molecule - molecule interactions .",

    "the first process is cavity decay , which can be treated using the standard born - markov master equation for the density operator @xcite , @xmath46 in addition to this , the cavity is pumped by some external source .",
