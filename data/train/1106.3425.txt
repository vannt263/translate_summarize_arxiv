    "synchronization of non - interacting rhythmic elements by common random driving signals  @xcite , termed _",
    "stochastic _ or _ noise - induced synchrony _ , may explain synchronous behavior of various systems ranging from lasers  @xcite and electronic circuits  @xcite to spiking neurons  @xcite and ecological populations  @xcite , where direct mutual interaction among the elements does not exist or is not appropriate to assume .",
    "recent studies have revealed that such synchronization generically occurs in a wide class of rhythmic systems including limit - cycle , chaotic , or stochastic oscillators , and also for various types of stochastic signals such as gaussian , poisson , and chaotic noise  @xcite .",
    "efficiency of the stochastic synchronization is usually quantified by the lyapunov exponent averaged over noise , which measures the mean exponential growth ( or decay ) rate of small differences between the oscillator states subjected to the common noise . for a limit - cycle oscillator undergoing regular periodic oscillations , the lyapunov exponent can be calculated from the phase response curve ( prc )  @xcite , which is a fundamental quantity that characterizes the oscillator dynamics and which has been measured experimentally in many rhythmic elements  @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that for limit - cycle oscillators driven by weak gaussian or poisson noise , the lyapunov exponent is always negative irrespective of the precise shape of the prc , ensuring that synchronization always takes place  @xcite .",
    "what prc shape yields the best synchronization ?",
    "for weak gaussian driving noise , abouzeid and ermentrout  @xcite obtained the optimal functional shape of the prc by minimizing the lyapunov exponent with constraints on its amplitude and smoothness , which was nearly sinusoidal with a pair of positive and negative lobes ( called type - ii , a normal form of the prc near the hopf bifurcation  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the optimal functional shapes may differ for other driving signals .",
    "here we consider poisson random impulsive signals with low frequency , which can also induce synchronization of limit cycles  @xcite .",
    "when the intensity of the impulse is weak , the linear gaussian approximation holds and the optimal prc can be shown to be sinusoidal , but for stronger impulses , the optimal solution may take different shapes . by using the shooting method  @xcite to numerically solve the euler - lagrange equation  @xcite associated with the minimization of the lyapunov exponent ,",
    "we show that the optimal prc gradually deviates from the sinusoid and approaches a sawtooth as the constraint on its squared amplitude is varied .",
    "correspondingly , the lyapunov exponent becomes more negative and tends to diverge .",
    "our result implies the importance of nonlinearity in the phase response and may provide insights into real - world oscillators such as spiking neurons .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , some basic facts on synchronization of limit cycles by common poisson noise are presented . in sec .",
    "iii , we solve the optimization problem and show the gradual transition of the optimal solution between sinusoidal and sawtoothed shapes .",
    "section iv summarizes the article with discussions on possible relevance of the results to phase response curves of spiking neurons .",
    "the appendix gives details on wavenumber , symmetry , and phase - plane behavior of the optimal solutions .",
    "we also show the optimal prcs for stochastic desynchronzation .",
    "a pair of non - interacting identical limit - cycle oscillators driven by common poisson noise can be described by the following phase model  @xcite : @xmath0 under the assumption that the inter - impulse intervals are sufficiently large such that the oscillator orbit perturbed by an impulse relaxes back to the original limit cycle before receiving the next impulse . here",

    "_ report that synaptic strength of neurons in some cortical areas have a long - tailed distribution , meaning certain synapses are much stronger than others ( the amplitude of postsynaptic potentials spans over a few millivolts ) .",
    "thus , it might actually be more appropriate to consider finite - intensity impulses than weak gaussian noise as the driving signal to the neurons .",
    "the optimization viewpoint may give interesting insights into the understanding of biological systems , because they evolved to perform certain biological functions efficiently .",
    "if the stochastic synchronization mechanism is used in some biological systems , their prc may be optimized to best perform synchronization .",
    "the sawtoothed prcs that we obtained are not only optimal for the synchronization by common poisson noise , but they are singular in the sense that they lead to instantaneous phase resetting of the oscillators .",

    "in this appendix , we give detailed discussion on the dependence on the lagrange multiplier @xmath48 , symmetry , and phase - plane analysis , of the optimal solutions .",
    "we also show the optimal prcs for stochastic desynchronization .",
    "we find that if the multiplier @xmath61 or @xmath48 is sufficiently large , only small wavenumber ( long wavelength ) solutions are allowed for @xmath65 or @xmath92 .",
    "this can be proven for the euler - lagrange equations  ( [ eq02 ] ) , ( [ eq22 ] ) and ( [ eq31 ] ) .",
    "we consider a solution of the euler - lagrange equation ( [ eq02 ] ) with wavenumber @xmath73 and denote the corresponding lagrange multipliers ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "substitution into ( [ eq02 ] ) yields @xmath161 namely , the lagrange multipliers scale with the wavenumber @xmath73 as @xmath162 and @xmath163",
    ". thus , larger @xmath47 and smaller @xmath48 lead to prcs with larger wavenumbers .",
    "we set @xmath48 sufficiently large to obtain the @xmath84 solution in the main text .",
    "rescaling the phase variable as @xmath164 , the euler - lagrange equaion  ( [ eq22 ] ) is transformed to @xmath165 defining a rescaled prc @xmath166 , the above equation can be cast into the same form as eq .",
    "( [ eq22 ] ) , @xmath167 where rescaled lagrange multipliers @xmath168 and @xmath169 are introduced .",
    "thus , if @xmath53 is a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq22 ] ) with multipliers @xmath47 and @xmath48 , its rescaled function @xmath170 is also a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq22 ] ) with rescaled multipliers @xmath171 and @xmath172 ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "this implies that larger wavenumber solutions ( @xmath174 ) correspond to larger @xmath47 and smaller @xmath48 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] , the multiplier @xmath47 control the squared amplitude @xmath94 and determine the shape of the periodic solutions .",
    "thus , @xmath48 determines the wavenumber of the solution , which we take sufficiently large ( @xmath116 ) to obtain the prc corresponding to @xmath84 .",
    "similarly , rescaling eq .",
    "( [ eq31 ] ) , we obtain @xmath175 to find @xmath176 and @xmath169 .",
    "thus , if @xmath48 is sufficiently large , the prc takes the smallest wavenumber @xmath84 .      from eqs .",
    "( [ eq22 ] ) and ( [ eq31 ] ) with periodic boundary conditions @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and @xmath179 , we obtained symmetric solutions with respect to @xmath180 as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig01](a ) and [ fig03](a ) .",
    "these prcs inherit the symmetry from the euler - lagrange equations ( or the actions to be minimized ) . to see this ,",
    "let us define a function @xmath181 as @xmath182 the derivatives are @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and @xmath185 .",
    "substituting into eq .",
    "( [ eq22 ] ) , we find that @xmath181 obeys the same euler - lagrange equation as @xmath53 , @xmath186 with the same boundary conditions @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and @xmath189 ( note that all the solutions satisfy @xmath190 ) .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath191 , indicating that @xmath53 is symmetric with respect to @xmath121 .    similarly ,",
    "when the optimal prc @xmath53 obeys the euler - lagrange equation  ( [ eq31 ] ) , we can show that @xmath181 satisfies the same equation @xmath192 with the same boundary conditions .",
    "thus , @xmath193 holds and @xmath53 is also symmetric with respect to @xmath121 .",
    "as we explained , we fix the multiplier @xmath48 large ( but still much smaller than unity , @xmath194 ) to obtain physically realistic prcs . here , to gain insights into how the shapes of the optimal prcs are determined , we set @xmath195 and ignore the 4th - order derivatives in the euler - lagrange equations , which does not affect the solutions qualitatively . with this approximation ,",
    "the dependence of the optimal solution on the constraint @xmath94 or on the lagrange multiplier @xmath47 can be clarified by a simple phase - plane analysis .",
    "we set @xmath195 to approximate eq .",
    "( [ eq22 ] ) as @xmath196 and rewrite this equation as @xmath197 we examine the orbit of this two - dimensional dynamical system as a function of @xmath85 on the @xmath198 plane with a periodic boundary condition @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",

    "[ fig05](b ) is the corresponding optimal prc .",
    "no orbit starting from @xmath206 can form a closed loop , because the vector field points to the upper - right and lower right in the third and fourth quadrant , respectively .",
    "thus , in this region , the orbits have to jump from @xmath207 to @xmath208 as shown by a broken curve in fig .  [ fig05](a ) . however , the periods of such orbits are always less than @xmath120 and therefore solutions with @xmath209 do not exist",

    "( [ eqa4 ] ) that the lagrangian multiplier @xmath47 determines the time scale of the dynamics in the vertical @xmath210 direction . as @xmath47 increases , the vertical dynamics becomes faster , so that the orbit is more strongly attracted to the separatrix @xmath202 and tends to move along it , as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig05](d ) .",
