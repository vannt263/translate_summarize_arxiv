    "self - avoiding walk models are of interest as models of polymers in solution@xcite as well as realisations of @xmath1 spin models in the limit @xmath2@xcite .",
    "the self - avoiding walk problem is a difficult problem numerically because of the intrinsic long ranged nature of the problem ; self - avoiding walks are extended objects .",
    "the numerical methods most used to date for the study of such models are monte carlo simulations@xcite , series expansions@xcite and transfer matrix calculations@xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulations are hampered by problems of trapping in the low temperature , or equivalently large interaction , phases .",
    "these may be relieved using the fluctuating bond method@xcite , which also enables the investigation of the dense walk phases .",
    "this method has the drawback of modifying the model in a way which is not always convenient , particularly if frustration effects are of interest .",
    "current monte carlo methods , such as the perm method@xcite and parallel tempering@xcite , relieve these difficulties to some extent , but at the cost of computational complexity .",
    "series expansions are limited by the lengths of walks that may be enumerated . in practice",
    "these are limited to a few tens of lattice steps .",
    "very technical methods may be used to achieve longer series expansions of the partition function ( of the order of 60 lattice steps ) , and in some cases the estimate of the critical point is very impressive@xcite .",
    "if correlation length exponents are required , then the range of walk lengths open to enumeration are of the order of 30 steps@xcite .",
    "this becomes increasingly limiting as the complexity of the model increases .",
    "transfer matrices have the advantage over monte carlo simulations of giving numerically exact values of the free energy , correlation lengths , polymer densities , etc . , for strips of infinite length , but of finite width .",
    "finite size analysis methods then allow the extrapolation of the finite size estimates .",
    "the widths of lattice accessible are limited : for the self - avoiding walk model widths up to 12 or 14 are possible ( see for example @xcite ) , but this again drops as the complexity of the model increases ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "it often occurs that the number of data points one may use in finite size analysis becomes dangerously small for finite size scaling techniques to be of use , particularly if odd / even parity effects are present .    in this article",
    "we apply a recent extension of the corner transfer matrix renormalisation group ( ctmrg ) method@xcite to a class of self - avoiding walks introduced by blte and nienhuis , which we shall refer to as the vertex - interacting self - avoiding walk model , to reflect the fact that the monomer - monomer interactions are added for doubly visited sites ( for a full description of the model see ) .",
    "we will show that the ctmrg method extends the possibilities of transfer matrices to larger system sizes , at the cost of introducing a phase space truncation scheme .",
    "the accuracy of the results is however controllable through a parameter @xmath3 corresponding to the number of states kept from one iteration to the next .",
    "the other important result in this paper relates to the vertex - interacting self - avoiding walk model . whilst it has the standard collapse transition as a special case ( where the walk is obliged to turn after each step ) ,",
    "it is believed to have a generic collapse transition in a different universality class@xcite .",
    "we show that this collapse transition has a first order character , despite the fact that there exists critical exponent @xmath4 which has been exactly determined by warnaar @xcite .",
    "transfer matrices , as a numerical method , have a major advantage over monte carlo methods in that they sum over all possible configurations , and so are not hampered by trapping effects at low temperatures ( or high densities in polymer problems ) which plague monte carlo simulations of models with competing interactions ( frustrated models ) .",
    "the major inconvenience is the large amount of computer memory required to store the matrices , limiting the maximum lattice width in practical calculations .",
    "this is alleviated in part by finite - size analysis methods which work well@xcite , at least for the simpler models , coupled with efficient extrapolation methods@xcite .    in two - dimensional classical spin models , or one - dimensional quantum spin models , there exist iterative approximation schemes which , by successive pruning of phase space , permit calculations for much larger lattice widths for given computer resources .",
    "these methods are the density matrix renormalisation group method ( dmrg)@xcite and the corner transfer matrix renormalisation group method ( ctmrg)@xcite .",
    "these methods have little recourse to the renormalisation group , and are better thought of as iterative matrix approximation schemes .",
    "the basic idea is that the ( approximate ) transfer matrix for a lattice of size @xmath5 is calculated from the transfer matrix for a lattice of size @xmath6 by inserting extra lattice sites .",
    "a change of basis is then performed , such that the transfer matrix may be projected onto a smaller basis , with the smallest possible loss of information .    in a recent paper",
    "we showed how the ctmrg method , first introduced for classical spin systems by nishino@xcite , may be applied to self - avoiding walk type models@xcite .",
    "this requires a non - trivial modification of the method since the iteration scheme requires all interactions to be local .",
    "the self - avoiding walk problem , by its very nature , is non - local . in the remainder of this section the details of the method ,",
    "absent in reference@xcite , are provided . in particular",
    "we show how this non - locality may be overcome , and describe the implementation of ctmrg for this class of problem .",
    "it is known that spin models with @xmath1 invariant spins have high temperature expansions consisting of closed loops . the self - avoiding loop",
    "( sal ) model is related to the high temperature expansion of the @xmath7 model@xcite . in a similar way",
    ", the high temperature expansion of the susceptibility leads to a model with one open path , and a gas of loops@xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 limit eliminates the loops to leave a self - avoiding walk .",
    "the partition function for a self - avoiding walk is thus equivalent to the susceptibility of an @xmath7 spin model .",
    "the connection between the @xmath1 class of models and better known models is as follows : @xmath8 corresponds to the ising model , @xmath9 to the xy model and @xmath10 to the classical heisenberg model .",
    "the partition functions of these models are given by : @xmath11 where @xmath12 refers to a sum over nearest neighbour spins .",
    "whilst the high - temperature expansion of the ising model is relatively easy , the expansion for other values of @xmath13 is a little cumbersome . in what follows",
    "we shall consider a slightly different @xmath1 invariant model , due to nienhuis@xcite , with the partition function given by @xmath14 where the spins , @xmath15 , are placed on the lattice bonds .",
    "a diagrammatic expansion of equation  [ nonpart ] follows if we identify the @xmath16 as the weight of an empty bond between the sites @xmath17 and @xmath18 and the @xmath19 as the weight of an occupied bond .",
    "since @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the only terms in the expansion of equation  [ nonpart ] which survive the sum over @xmath22 are those terms consisting of closed loops where the ` colour ' @xmath23 is conserved around each loop .",
    "different loops may have different ` colours ' .",
    "the sum over @xmath23 gives a factor @xmath13 for each loop .",
    "an equivalent expression for equation  [ nonpart ] may now be given in terms of loop graphs @xmath24 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of loops and @xmath27 is the number of occupied bonds .",
    "the partition for self - avoiding loops is then just @xmath28    the parameter @xmath13 is now a fugacity controlling the number of loops , and in this representation need no longer be taken as an integer .",
    "this fugacity corresponds to a long - range interaction , since the loops may be of any size .",
    "this non - locality is undesirable for our purposes .",
    "we would like to express @xmath13 as a product over local weights despite the variable size of the loops .",
    "the only real numbers with this property are @xmath29 and 1 .",
    "this leads us to introduce complex local weights , @xmath30 . if @xmath31 , the product of the @xmath30 around a loop will also be of modulus 1 .",
    "the final weight must , however , be real .",
    "this may be achieved if for every complex weight , we also have its complex conjugate .",
    "each loop may be followed clockwise or anticlockwise .",
    "the loops in equation  [ gpart ] are not oriented , but may be oriented by associating @xmath32 oriented graphs with each non - oriented graph .",
    "the loop fugacity is not required to be the same for the two orientations of the loop , and so a fugacity @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is associated with ( anti)clockwise oriented loops .",
    "the partition function may then be written@xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the set of oriented loop graphs and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is the number of ( anti)clockwise oriented loops . on the square lattice",
    "there must be four more corners with one orientation , compared to the other orientation , in order to close a loop .",
    "using this fact we may set @xmath39 for a clockwise corner , @xmath40 for an anticlockwise corner and @xmath41 otherwise .",
    "this leads to @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and hence @xmath44 .",
    "the oriented loop factor has now been broken up into local weights and the partition function may be rewritten in terms of a vertex model@xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the weight of the vertex found at site @xmath17 .",
    "the possible vertices are shown in figure  [ verts ] .",
    "the derivation given here is only for the simplest case , but we may freely change the weights of the vertex configurations in order to generate different interactions in the original model . notably , to have exactly the standard self - avoiding walk model it is necessary to set the weights of vertices 14 to 19 to zero , and set @xmath47 , or equivalently set @xmath48 .    a vertex model may be thought of as a spin model where the spins live on the bonds of the lattice .",
    "each spin has three states corresponding to the empty lattice bond , a bond oriented in the positive @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) direction and a bond oriented in the negative @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) direction .",
    "the vertex weights may be written as a vertex function @xmath51 , where the tensor elements correspond to the vertex weights of figure  [ verts ] .",
    "the vertex function was defined using the following convention : @xmath52      in this section we apply the ctmrg method explicitly to the vertex - interacting self - avoiding walk model introduced by blte and nienhuis@xcite .",
    "this model consists of a random walk which is allowed to collide at a site , but is not allowed to cross or occupy a bond more than once .",
    "an interaction energy @xmath53 is introduced for each collision , which replaces the attractive nearest - neighbour interaction present in the standard @xmath54-point model .",
    "a step fugacity , @xmath19 , is introduced in order to control the average length of the walk .",
    "a stiffness is also introduced by weighting sites sitting on a bend in the walk differently from sites sitting on straight portions of the walk .",
    "following the convention of blte and nienhuis@xcite , we choose to add a weight @xmath55 to the straight segments of the walk .",
    "the choice @xmath56 then corresponds to a walk in which straight segments are eliminated ( the walk is obliged to turn through a right angle after each step ) .",
    "the partition function for the model is then given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the length of the walk ( number of steps ) , @xmath60 is the number of doubly occupied sites and @xmath61 is the number of corners .      following baxter@xcite",
    ", the partition function of a two - dimensional lattice model may be written in terms of the product of four matrices representing the four quarters of the lattice , see figure  [ corner ] .",
    "the inputs and outputs of the matrices are the configurations at the seams of the four quarters .",
    "these matrices are known as corner transfer matrices . in general",
    "the four matrices are different , but may often be related by lattice symmetries . for our model",
    "the four matrices are the same up to a complex conjugation operation .",
    "in general it is difficult to explicitly calculate these matrices for systems with a large number of sites .",
    "this is where the ctmrg method comes in@xcite ; the matrices for larger lattices are calculated iteratively from smaller lattices .",
    "this is done as follows .",
    "a prototype system consisting of a small number of spins , four in the case of a vertex model , is set up exactly , see figure  [ proto ] . at each iteration",
    "the system is enlarged by adding spins , and this enlarged system is then projected back onto the prototype system in some optimal way , so as to minimise the loss of information .",
    "the spins of the prototype system have @xmath3 states , where @xmath3 determines the amount of information which may be carried forwards at each iteration .",
    "in addition to the vertex function @xmath51 , we also introduce the vertex functions @xmath62 and @xmath63 where the @xmath64 are the @xmath3-state spins of the prototype system .",
    "the matrix @xmath65 corresponds to the estimate of the corner transfer matrix after @xmath66 iterations .",
    "the partition function for a @xmath67 lattice is given by @xmath68 where the @xmath69 denotes complex conjugation .",
    "the lattice is enlarged by introducing additional vertices , as shown in figure  [ cornerb ] .",
    "a corner matrix for the enlarged lattice is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 indicates that the appropriate contractions over indices are performed . in a similar way we introduce an enlarged vertex function @xmath72 by considering carefully the symmetry of the vertex function @xmath73 it may be shown that the partition function for the enlarged lattice @xmath74 is given by @xmath75    we now wish to project the enlarged model , defined through @xmath76 and @xmath77 , back onto the smaller prototype system , giving @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "since the configuration space is smaller after projection , some information is lost .",
    "the trick is to minimise this information loss .",
    "this is done by performing a change of basis in some optimal manner .",
    "the partition function @xmath80 is invariant by any change of basis , but the partial trace , giving @xmath81 after the change of basis , is not . for a model with real weights",
    "it is clear that the optimal choice will minimise @xmath82 .",
    "this is done by diagonalising the matrix @xmath83 and keeping the basis vectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues . in a model with real weights",
    "@xmath84 is just the density matrix , up to a constant . in the case",
    "considered here the eigenvalues of @xmath84 are complex , coming in conjugate pairs .",
    "minimising @xmath85 corresponds to taking the basis vectors for the eigenvalues with the largest real parts , since the imaginary parts cancel .",
    "this may well involve dropping terms contributing to @xmath86 with larger moduli than other terms which are kept .",
    "it is not clear how this effect propagates with the number of iterations .",
    "another choice is to keep the terms contributing to @xmath87 with the largest absolute values .",
    "this is found to give better results in practice . to complete the iteration scheme",
    ", we must also calculate @xmath78 .",
    "this is done by projecting @xmath88 onto @xmath78 using the same basis vectors . as this iterative process",
    "is repeated , the partition function and other thermodynamic quantities are calculated for larger and larger lattices .",
    "the value of @xmath3 defines the size of the configurational space kept from one iteration to the next",
    ". the larger the value of @xmath3 , the better the approximation .",
    "the iteration scheme not only gives an approximation of the partition function for a square system , but also gives an approximation for the transfer matrix from which an infinite strip may be constructed .",
    "the transfer matrix is given directly in terms of the vertex functions @xmath89 and @xmath73 as @xmath90 for even lattice widths ( width @xmath91 ) and @xmath92 for odd lattice widths ( width @xmath93 ) .",
    "free energies and correlation lengths for strips may then also be calculated , and the arsenal of finite - size scaling methods available for strips may be used .",
    "ctmrg is most efficient , however , when it is used to calculate directly one - point functions , such as the density , and this is how we use it in this article .",
    "the density is most simply calculated by selecting one of the central lattice bonds .",
    "the density @xmath94 is then given by @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the value of the spin on the selected bond . in terms of the corner transfer matrices , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a matrix",
    "whose elements take the value @xmath99 and @xmath100 is the linear dimension of the lattice .    in spin models",
    "the one - point functions are often calculated by the infinite lattice method@xcite , where the ctmrg method is iterated for a fixed value of @xmath3 until the quantity of interest ( magnetisation or energy per spin ) no longer changes .",
    "this occurs because the number of eigenstates kept at each iteration is no longer sufficient to propagate the two point correlations throughout the system .",
    "the limiting value of the one point correlation function may then be studied as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "in such a manner the magnetisation or energy per site may be estimated for the infinite system directly .",
    "this method relies on the rather nice way in which ctmrg breaks down for spin models .",
    "unfortunately the complex nature of the vertex models at the heart of our calculations gives rise to more complicated behaviour as @xmath3 is increased .",
    "shows the density of the self - avoiding walk model ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath47 , or equivalently @xmath48 ) as a function of @xmath103 for different values of @xmath3 .",
    "it is clearly seen that there is no limiting value for the density as @xmath103 is increased .",
    "once the value of @xmath3 is insufficient , @xmath94 has a chaotic oscillatory behaviour with @xmath103 . instead of fixing @xmath3 and varying @xmath103 , we choose to do the opposite . taking the density as an example",
    ", we define @xmath104 as the density for a system of linear dimension @xmath103 for a given value of @xmath3 .",
    "the limiting value of @xmath104 is calculated by increasing the value of @xmath3 for fixed @xmath103 until the required accuracy for @xmath105 is reached .",
    "this is then studied as a function of @xmath103 using finite - size scaling methods , described below .     for the self - avoiding walk model ( @xmath106 )",
    "calculated using ctmrg as a function of the linear size @xmath100 of the lattice for different values of @xmath3.,width=377 ]",
    "when @xmath56 the model is expected to have a critical behaviour equivalent to the standard @xmath54-point model@xcite ; for small enough @xmath107 the average length of the walk diverges as a critical value of the step fugacity , @xmath108 , is reached . at @xmath108",
    "the density is still zero and the gyration radius , @xmath109 , ( or any other characteristic measure of the size of the walk ) diverges as @xmath110 following a power law defining the correlation length exponent @xmath111 : @xmath112 for @xmath107 smaller than some tricritical value , @xmath113 , the walk is in the same universality class as the usual self - avoiding walk , and @xmath114 .",
    "this behaviour terminates at the tricritical point @xmath115 , where @xmath116 as for the standard @xmath54-point . for values of @xmath117",
    "the length of the walk diverges discontinuously at a first order transition .",
    "the phase diagram of the @xmath56 vertex - interacting model is qualitatively the same as for the @xmath54 point@xcite , and is shown schematically in . unlike for the standard @xmath54-point model , the location of the tricritical point is known exactly to be @xmath118@xcite .",
    "the idea is now to study this model using the ctmrg method outlined .",
    "as mentioned in , ctmrg gives as a byproduct an approximation of the transfer matrix for a strip of width @xmath103 through or , depending on the parity of l , from which the phase diagram and critical exponent @xmath111 could be calculated using the phenomenological renormalisation group due to nightingale@xcite .",
    "this turns out , at least for the case at hand , not to be the most efficient way of approaching the problem , due to the additional computational effort required to calculate the relevant eigenvalues of @xmath119 .",
    "the ctmrg method is far more efficient for the calculation of one - point functions , such as the bond density , which may be calculated in the middle of the system . with this in mind",
    "we use a phenomenological renormalisation scheme based directly on the scaling behaviour of density .",
    "the scaling ansatz states that the singular part of the free energy is a homogeneous function of its arguments@xcite .",
    "this leads to the following finite size scaling expression : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the spatial dimension , here @xmath122 . taking the first derivative , @xmath123    in general @xmath124 and",
    "so it is necessary to know the value of @xmath125 in order to exploit fully the scaling behaviour .",

    "a conservative estimate gives @xmath203 .",
    "these results indicate that the `` multicritical '' point is fairly exotic in that it corresponds generically to a first - order transition but with a critical behaviour if approached in a specific direction .",
    "we have tried to recover the critical exponent @xmath204 by using the scaling behaviour of the density at @xmath205 and @xmath206 . whilst the results are not inconsistent with @xmath4 ,",
    "they are not of very good quality and are also not inconsistent with a value @xmath207 as originally found by blte and nienhuis using transfer matrices@xcite .",
    "whilst in principle there is no limit to either the precision or lattice sizes obtainable using ctmrg , there is a practical limitation in terms of computing time and resources .",
    "in this paper we have presented a version of the corner transfer matrix renormalisation group method suitable for use with self - avoiding walk type models and related @xmath1 symmetric models .",
    "we have applied it to the vertex - interacting self - avoiding walk model .",
    "the method was shown to reproduce the known results , and has given new insight into the critical nature of the model when @xmath208 .",
    "self - avoiding walk models are used as models for polymers in dilute solution , and it is known that the lattice @xmath0-point model provides a good description of what happens for real homopolymers in solution@xcite .",
    "the standard textbook reason for not taking into account the rigidity of the polymer is that the rigidity simply changes the persistence length , or in terms of the lattice model the number of real monomers per step of the walk .",
    "the critical behaviour is unaffected in the infinite walk limit .",
    "this should be true as long as the fractal dimension @xmath163 is smaller than the spatial dimension ( i.e. @xmath209 here ) .",
    "however , when @xmath210 it may be expected that the polymer feels the presence of the lattice .",
    "this will then give rise to competition between the rigidity and the underlying lattice structure , reminiscent of frustration in spin models ( indeed the critical behaviour of the nienhuis @xmath1 model on the square lattice has been related to the fully - frustrated xy model@xcite ) .",
    "if such a claim is true , then the critical behaviour observed will be universal ( in the sense of not depending on the lattice ) and independent of rigidity if @xmath211 , and may be non - universal ( in the same restricted sense ) and may depend on the rigidity if @xmath210 .",
    "one could therefore argue that the simple observation that the critical behaviour of the collapse transition changes as @xmath55 is varied implies that the density is non - zero at the collapse transition when @xmath212 . in interpreting this transition as due to frustration",
    ", it should be noted that it does not exist for the @xmath1 model on the hexagonal lattice@xcite .",
    "there are other models which have qualitatively similar phase diagrams .",
    "most well known is the self - avoiding trail model@xcite .",
    "a trail is defined to be self - avoiding on the bonds , but is allowed to visit sites more than once , and in particular is allowed to intersect itself .",
    "the attractive interaction is again associated with doubly visited sites ( intersection or collision ) .",
    "it has been conjectured that the collapse transition for trails occurs exactly at @xmath213 with an exponent @xmath146 ; it is also conjectured that limiting density is zero .",
    "this conjecture resulted from a monte - carlo enumeration of extremely long walks of the kinetic trail model , believed to be equivalent to the trail model at the collapse transition@xcite .",
    "as discussed above , in this case what is being calculated is in fact the fractal dimension @xmath163 .",
    "the relation @xmath165 is only valid when the critical length may be measured using the gyration radius .",
    "as argued above , the validity of this identification may be questioned when @xmath210 .",
    "it would be of interest , then , to check by other means the possibility that the criticality is in fact not of the same type as observed here for @xmath214 .",
    "this question is currently under investigation .",
    "another model with a qualitatively similar phase diagram is the hydrogen - bonding model@xcite .",
    "this model includes interactions between nearest - neighbour sites , which may be taken into account in the ctmrg method by mapping the walk model onto a 4-state vertex model with complex weights .",
    "there are , however , important differences , notably the high-@xmath107 dense - walk phase has @xmath215 throughout , whereas here @xmath216 except in the limit @xmath217 . to what extent this may affect the nature of the phase transitions is not clear ; early results indicate that perhaps the dense - walk phase transition is not in the ising universality class@xcite .",
