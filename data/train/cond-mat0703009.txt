    "during the last decade several physical systems have been proposed as candidates for _ qubits _ @xcite and , among those , condensed matter devices have been attracting a growing interest in the area @xcite .",
    "there are many reasons for this and most of them involve the way one designs , controls and accesses individual qubits in quantum systems containing a very large number of such entities .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the fact that dealing with solid state devices one can use the same standard electronic circuitry of conventional computers .",
    "furthermore , new and powerful experimental techniques allow us to expect that these qubits could be more easily scalable and that control over the processing of information and implementation of possible protocols of error correction could be done in a more reliable and efficient way .",
    "these are only a few points in favour of these systems as being good candidates for qubits .    despite these important favourable points , there are also negative aspects concerning the use of solid state devices as qubits . since they are mainly meso or nanoscopic devices , which under specific conditions mimic two - state system behavior , it is a very hard task to isolate them from their environment . moreover , as it is already well known , the system - bath interaction causes loss of quantum coherence which is a drawback for quantum computation @xcite , in particular , if we do not wish to operate our devices at too low temperatures . therefore , there must be a compromise between the desirable features possessed by these systems and the undesirable effect of decoherence .",
    "it is along this direction that people have been investigating electronic spins in quantum dots as promising candidates for qubits @xcite .",
    "since the confinement of the electronic wave function isolates the spins from most energy relaxation channels , there are situations where decoherence takes place only beyond a fairly long time interval . here",
    "we mean a time interval within which a large number of logical operations could be coherently performed .",
    "in particular , for self - assembled quantum dots , the energies involved in the spin dynamics are such that the decoherence time is indeed very long .",
    "however , what is advantageous on the one hand turns out to be a problem otherwise .",
    "as the spin is a microscopic variable one has to face the problem of how to access it experimentally .    a possible way to address one of the many spins in the quantum processor",
    "is by tuning the frequency of a time dependent external magnetic field ( the transverse pumping or control field ) to the spin s larmor frequency .",
    "indeed , koppens and collaborators @xcite have demonstrated very recently the first experimental realization of single electron spin rotations in quantum dot systems , which is a necessary step for the implementation of universal quantum operations .",
    "they showed , through current measurements in double quantum dots , the ability of performing spin - flips using a resonant oscillating magnetic field with the spin s larmor frequency .",
    "therefore , in this work , we shall investigate the dissipative dynamics of an electronic spin confined to a quantum dot subject to a strong static magnetic field and a much weaker transverse pumping field .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the main mechanisms of relaxation of the latter are the spin - orbit interaction @xcite and the hyperfine interaction with the spins of the host lattice @xcite .",
    "for static fields stronger than @xmath0 t it is expected that the spin - orbit interaction plays a major role in the relaxation process .",
    "the relaxation times experimentally observed for fields above @xmath1 t are within the range @xmath2ms@xcite which encourages us to study the possibility of implementing spins confined in quantum dots as qubits .",
    "following previous works @xcite , we investigate the dissipative effects originating from the coupling of the orbital electronic motion to the acoustic phonon modes of the lattice where the dots are embedded . due to the spin - orbit coupling ,",
    "the spin degree of freedom becomes indirectly damped by the latter .",
    "consequently , it is possible to define an effective dissipative two - state system @xcite whose dynamics may not be describable pertubatively @xcite . in particular , one should stress the existence of a very sharp effective bath resonance at energies much lower than the planar electronic confinement energy .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to evaluate the dissipative dynamics of a structured spin - boson model in the presence of a time dependent magnetic field aiming at the determination of the best operational conditions under which these systems could be employed as good qubits . in section [ model ]",
    "we present the model we use to describe this dynamical process . in section",
    "[ results ] , we obtain the approximate analytical solutions to the bloch - redfield equations for the average values of the spin components . finally , in section [ discussion ] , we carry out a detailed analysis of the solutions we have obtained .",
    "we consider quantum dots with strong confinement in the @xmath3 direction , and electronic orbital motion in the @xmath4 plane subject to a confining parabolic potential .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling is modelled by a dresselhaus interaction term projected onto the plane of the dot . besides , we add a term due the presence of an externally applied magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "thus , these assumptions lead to the following spin - orbit hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the lateral harmonic frequency , @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 is the kane parameter@xcite , @xmath10 is the electron effective mass ) , @xmath11 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath12 is the usual ladder operators for the @xmath13 direction",
    ".    the electron - phonon hamiltonian , considering either the piezoelectric or the deformation potential interactions with acoustic phonon modes , can be mapped into the bath of oscillators model @xcite with the spectral function given by @xcite@xmath14 where @xmath15 for the piezoelectric interaction with dimensionless coupling @xmath16 , and @xmath17 for the deformation potential with @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the debye frequency . @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the longitudinal and transverse sound velocities respectively , @xmath22 is the material density , @xmath23 is the electromechanical tensor for zinc - blende structures@xcite , and @xmath24 is the deformation potential at the @xmath25 point@xcite .",
    "@xmath26 is the heaviside step function .",
    "provided that we have introduced a bath of oscillators for the electron - phonon coupling , and because of the spin - orbit interaction , one can think of this problem as a spin degree of freedom coupled to an effective bath of oscillators @xcite with the following effective bath spectral function @xmath27 where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , with @xmath30 being the generalized _ incomplete beta function_.    figure [ j2 ] presents the @xmath31 behavior for the piezoelectric interaction case , @xmath15 .",
    "the most prominent feature of its behavior is the peak at @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is determined by @xmath34 furthermore , the region around @xmath33 can be well approximated by a lorentzian of width @xmath35 ( see inset of figure [ j2 ] ) , given by @xmath36 the asymptotic analysis of @xmath31 also reveals that in the low frequency range , defined by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the effective spectral density is always super - ohmic , with power @xmath39 . on the opposite side of the resonance , and in the high frequency limit , @xmath40 , the spectral density behaves as a power law in the frequency @xmath41 with exponent @xmath42 .",
    "since we know the spectral density of the effective bath of oscillators coupled to the spin degree of freedom , our problem can now be modelled by the driven spin - boson hamiltonian @xmath43\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\sum_{i}\\hbar\\omega_{i}\\left(\\hat{b}_{i}^{\\dagger}\\hat{b}_{i}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)+\\hat{\\sigma}_{z}\\sum_{i}c_{i } \\left(\\hat{b}_{i}^{\\dagger}+\\hat{b}_{i}\\right),\\quad\\label{hsb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the spectral density of the environment is given by ( [ jeff ] ) , and the applied magnetic field @xmath44 . in the weak coupling limit ,",
    "the equations of motion for the spin expectation values , @xmath45 $ ] , can be written , for this specific model , as the generalized bloch - redfield equation @xcite @xmath46 where the fluctuating terms are given by @xcite @xmath47 and the temperature dependent relaxation rates are determined by@xcite@xmath48b_{ij}(t , t'),~{\\rm with}~ \\gamma_{yy}\\left(t\\right)=\\gamma_{xx}\\left(t\\right).\\]]the correlation function @xmath49 with @xmath50 , takes into account all the effects of the bath of oscillators .",
    "the functions @xmath51 read @xmath52,~ b_{yz}=-2\\textrm{im}\\left[u_{rr}u_{rl}\\right]\\ ] ] and @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the non - dissipative time evolution operator for the spin system and its matrix elements @xmath55 and @xmath56 ,  are written in the basis defined by @xmath57 .",
    "( [ br ] ) are derived @xcite under the assumption that @xmath58 , where @xmath59 represents the cutoff frequency of the system .",
    "from here onwards we will be interested in the study of a monochromatic field of the form @xmath60 , considering it as a small perturbation to the spin dynamics , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath61 .",
    "in order to solve the bloch - redfield equations we need to compute the non - dissipative time evolution operator @xmath54 . using the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , we obtain the following simple analytic form to the time evolution operator @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , with @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 are , respectively , the rabi and larmor frequencies of the problem , @xmath69 is the external field frequency and @xmath70 represents the frequency detuning .",
    "the bloch - redfield coefficients can now be evaluated using the spectral density of the bath oscillators and @xmath71 .",
    "we proceed evaluating the time integrals first .",
    "those have sine and co - sine elementary integrands that , when appropriately rearranged , can be written in terms of @xmath72 functions , whose maxima occur at the natural frequencies of the system @xmath69 , and @xmath73 . following this procedure ,",
    "the coefficients of the bloch - redfield equations can be written in the compact form @xmath74 ( see appendix for the explicit presentation of those coefficients ) .",
    "the new coefficients @xmath75 and @xmath76 have their time dependence determined by the integrals @xmath77 , eqs .",
    "( [ integrals1 ] ) and ( [ integrals2 ] ) .",
    "those integrals , in the regime of interest , @xmath78 , have their main contributions decomposed in two parts : one , time - dependent , occurs due to terms arising from the poles of the spectral density in the complex plane , which have lifetimes determined by their imaginary parts ; the other part is a time - independent contribution due to the resonance of system with the external applied field .",
    "therefore , each coefficient @xmath75 and @xmath76 can also be written in well - characterized time dependent and independent parts .",
    "in fact , considering @xmath79 given by ( [ jeff ] ) , whose main poles are @xmath80 , we can write @xmath81 as @xmath82}{\\omega_{s}-\\omega^{(i ) } } \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{\\sin\\left[\\left(\\omega_{s}+\\omega^{(i)}\\right)t\\right]}{\\omega_{s}+\\omega^{(i)}}\\bigg\\ } + \\tilde{r}_{1},\\label{r1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 ; @xmath84 . the first term on the r.h.s of eq . ( [ r1 ] ) is a direct contribution of the poles of @xmath85 , and the last term , @xmath86 , takes into account the time independent terms of @xmath87 . substituting ( [ r1 ] ) in the bloch - redfield equations",
    ", we can find a particular solution for @xmath88 , up to first order in @xmath89 , due to the first term of eq .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) .",
    "thus we can write @xmath90 as follows @xmath91 it is clear that the particular solution has a lifetime determined by the width @xmath89 of the peak of the effective spectral density .",
    "the modes arising from this term oscillate with the system s natural frequencies shifted by the bath resonance @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the contributions due to the poles of @xmath31 introduce a new time scale , @xmath92 , in the dynamics of the dissipative spin , which distinguishes the short and long time regimes of the problem .",
    "the first term of ( [ r1 ] ) is expected to be the dominant contribution of the poles of @xmath31 for the spin dynamics , because those arising from @xmath93 and @xmath94 oscillate with frequency @xmath95 larger than those from @xmath81 . after integrating the equations of motion over any measurable time interval ,",
    "their effects become negligible .    now , since we have determined the coefficients @xmath96 , we can obtain analytic solutions for the bloch - redfield equations . for the long time regime , @xmath97 , those coefficients approach very quickly their asymptotic values @xmath98 , with @xmath99 .",
    "a solution can be obtained using the laplace transformation for the regime of interest , namely @xmath61 . retaining terms up to order of @xmath100 , and considering the initial condition @xmath101",
    ", we find the following approximated solutions    @xmath102    where @xmath103 the shift @xmath104 in the natural resonance frequency can be understood as the frequency correction to the spin dynamics due to the interaction with the bath of oscillators .",
    "in contrast to the procedure adopted in @xcite , this correction arises naturally from the solution obtained .",
    "the frequency shift @xmath104 has the form of a lamb shift    @xmath105 . \\label{lambshift}\\ ] ]    this expression is very similar to that found in the non - perturbative treatment of the atom - field interaction @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth noting that eq .",
    "( [ lambshift ] ) is derived here as a temperature dependent function .",
    "the rates appearing in eq .",
    "( [ sigmax ] ) and ( [ sigmaz ] ) can be written approximately as @xmath106 and @xmath107 , where @xmath108    figure [ gammaom ] presents the rate @xmath25 as a function of the driven field frequency @xmath69 .",
    "it is clear that there is a signature of the peak of spectral density @xmath109 in its behavior .",
    "close to the peak , @xmath110 , the rate @xmath25 can be several orders of magnitude higher than the asymptotic value @xmath111 .",
    "this result shows which regime of frequency must be avoided to obtain the largest relaxation time of the system .",
    "finally , the coefficients can be written as @xmath112 the function @xmath113 gives a measure of the effects of the driven field on the spin dynamics .",
    "as expected , there are two important features to be considered : one is its intensity @xmath114 ; and the other is how distant @xmath69 is from the shifted natural resonance frequency @xmath115 .    in the limit @xmath116 , we obtain @xmath117 , where @xmath25 is the well - known expression@xcite @xmath118 , and @xmath119 is exactly the expected thermodynamical mean value . for the resonant case @xmath120 , we have @xmath121 , which implies @xmath122 .",
    "the system evolves with a frequency imposed by the external driving field , and relaxes to a state where both spin components are equally probable .",
    "a detailed description of those phenomena is presented in the next section .",
    "figures [ irsigxplot]-[irsigzforaplot ] present the expectation values of @xmath123 and @xmath124 for the near resonance , @xmath120 , and the off - resonance , @xmath125 , cases . here",
    "we assume @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that , in the absence of dissipation , the system would indefinitely evolve into coherent cycles of absorption and emission of energy - the rabi oscillations .",
    "furthermore , the change in the spin up and down populations exhibits an oscillatory time dependence with frequency @xmath130 , and amplitude @xmath131 .",
    "it is worth noting that under the resonance condition , @xmath125 , the oscillating field fully drives the transitions between up and down spin states and that the weaker the driving field , the narrower the resonance peak .",
    "as one can notice by inspecting figures [ irsigxplot ] and [ irsigxforaplot ] , the coupling system - bath changes some of those features .",
    "first of all , the resonance condition is no longer verified at the frequency associated with the static applied field .",
    "now , the new natural frequency is given by @xmath132 , where the shift @xmath104 , eq .",
    "( [ lambshift ] ) , is completely associated with the coupling between the system and its reservoir - lamb shift .",
    "this is exactly the behavior we have for the first plots of figures [ irsigxplot ] and [ irsigxforaplot ] : the largest amplitudes of oscillation occur for those frequencies closest to the new resonance condition . as expected , the component @xmath133 oscillates with frequency @xmath134 at resonance , and @xmath135 for the off - resonance @xmath125 case .",
    "another important change in the spin dynamics is that the system does not evolve indefinitely in coherent cycles of absorption and emission of energy .",
    "in fact , the dissipation process induced by the coupling to the dissipative bath destroys the coherence in the emission - absorption cycles and , after a long time , decoherence takes place .",
    "indeed , the behavior of the expectation value of @xmath136 in the long time regime ( figures [ irsigxplot ] and [ irsigxforaplot ] ) , reveals this decoherence process .",
    "as one can see , the large amplitude of oscillations observed initially , a consequence of the coherent emission - absorption stimulated by the field , tends to decrease in time .",
    "this process occurs in a time scale given by @xmath137 , eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , which has almost the same value as presented in figures [ irsigxplot ] and [ irsigxforaplot ] .",
    "this happens because for both cases we are away from the peak of the rate @xmath25 , figure [ gammaom ] , where it is practically a constant given by @xmath138 .",
    "for very long times , @xmath139 , the system reaches a stationary state , oscillating with frequency @xmath95 ( inset of figure [ irsigxforaplot ] ) and small amplitude around the asymptotic value @xmath140 . here",
    "we observe that this asymptotic value changes dramatically when we leave the resonance condition .",
    "this feature can be understood as follows . at resonance ,",
    "the driving field causes perfect transitions between up and down eigenstates of @xmath141 , but because the system - bath coupling destroys the coherence along the process , we see that after a very long time , @xmath139 , a completely random emission - absorption process sets in and makes the expectation value of @xmath141 vanish . for the off - resonance case , the driving field no longer produces 100@xmath142 probability transitions in the system .",
    "again , the coupling with the bath destroys the coherence of this process , and favours the occupation of the lowest energy state .",
    "thus , as we are considering a small applied field , i.e , @xmath143 , the bath drives the system towards its thermodynamical equilibrium state at zero driving field , @xmath144 .",
    "since we have assumed @xmath145 , this implies @xmath146 .",
    "how close the system will approach that asymptotic value depends on both the intensity and frequency of the driving field .",
    "all the features discussed so far were general consequences of the system - bath interaction , and do not depend on the specific form of the spectral density of the bath .",
    "nevertheless , the first plots of figures [ irsigxplot ] and [ irsigxforaplot ] show a particular behavior for short times : two well defined regimes of oscillation frequencies can be observed .",
    "this phenomenon is a signature of the rich structure of the effective spectral density , eq .",
    "( [ jeff ] ) .",
    "in fact , because @xmath31 has poles in the complex plane , new modes of oscillation arise in the spin dynamics .",
    "those new modes have lifetimes imposed by the imaginary part of the poles , whereas the natural frequencies of the system are shifted by their real part .",
    "as we could observe from @xmath31 ( [ jeff ] ) , the most important modes ( those with long lifetimes and measurable amplitude of oscillations ) due to the poles are associated with the peak of @xmath31 , at which a strong correlation between orbital and spin degrees of freedom takes place .",
    "these modes , ( see the first term of eq .",
    "( [ sigmax ] ) ) , have lifetimes determined by the width @xmath89 of the bath resonance , and frequencies @xmath147 , with @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "the amplitude of oscillation , assuming a weak driving field , @xmath143 , can be approximated by @xmath151 ( for @xmath152 ) .",
    "therefore , if one experimentally reaches the conditions @xmath153 and @xmath154 , it would be possible to determine some physical parameters of spin - bath coupling , _",
    "e.g. _ , the electron - phonon constant coupling @xmath155 .",
    "figures [ irsigzresplot ] and [ irsigzforaplot ] show the @xmath156 component for the same conditions previously discussed .",
    "as it can be noticed , there is a clear structure of beats in its dynamical behavior . at resonance ,",
    "figure [ irsigzresplot ] , the beat and angular frequencies are , respectively , given by @xmath157 and @xmath158 . for this component",
    "we do not verify two oscillatory regimes for times of the order of @xmath92 .",
    "this occurs because of the suppression of the pole s contribution by the strong oscillations of the remaining terms . as a consequence of the decoherence process imposed by the bath of oscillators ,",
    "other important feature is that , for long times , the modes related with the frequencies @xmath159 evanesce , destroying the beat structure .",
    "these modes are associated with the coherent oscillations due to the driving field .",
    "thus , after a long time , only an oscillatory regime of frequency @xmath69 remains .",
    "the characteristic time for that is of the order of @xmath137 .",
    "the regime slightly off resonance @xmath125 , figure [ irsigzforaplot ] , practically does not change . in this case",
    "the beat and angular frequencies are given respectively by @xmath157 e @xmath160 .",
    "this shows that the component @xmath156 is not so sensitive to how close the external field frequency is to the natural resonance frequency of the spin .",
    "as it is directly coupled to the external field , this component has a stronger dependence on its amplitude .",
    "now , we will focus on the specific case in which we use bulk physical parameters for typical quantum dots size .",
    "we assume here the piezoelectric electron - phonon interaction , @xmath15 , and quantum dots frequencies @xmath161mev .",
    "the external fields applied to the dots are assumed to be such that @xmath162 and @xmath163 , and the debye frequency @xmath164 .",
    "figures [ sigxplot ] and [ sigzplot ] present the @xmath88 and @xmath156 dynamics using the bulk physical parameters @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 . the temperature used for the calculation is @xmath168 .    the plots * a * in figures [ sigxplot ] and [ sigzplot ] show the dynamics of the expectation values @xmath90 and @xmath169 , respectively , for the case close to the resonance , @xmath120 .",
    "we can see that the dynamics of @xmath88 has a well defined frequency of oscillation , given by @xmath170 , with amplitude close to @xmath171 . because of the weak coupling limit , the terms in eq .",
    "( [ sigmax ] ) due to the poles of the spectral density are negligible compared to the others .",
    "therefore , this explains why we do not distinguish between several different regimes of relaxation .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath172 is estimated to be of the order of @xmath173 .",
    "for the @xmath156 component we see the expected beat structure , with well characterized beat and angular frequencies given by @xmath157 and @xmath160 , respectively .    the plots * b * in figures [ sigxplot ] and [ sigzplot ] present the dynamics for a case off resonance , @xmath174 .",
    "now we can see that several frequencies contribute to the spin dynamics . for @xmath88 ,",
    "the main oscillation frequency is still @xmath157 , however the amplitude of oscillations has decreased more than one order of magnitude . the @xmath156 dynamics has also changed .",
    "there is still a structure of beats but more frequencies appear in the spectral decomposition .",
    "@xmath157 and @xmath158 are the beat and angular frequencies for this case . for the very long time regime , @xmath139 , the component @xmath88 reaches the stationary equilibrium oscillating with frequency @xmath95 and very small amplitude @xmath175 , around the value @xmath176 . for @xmath156",
    "we observe that the beat structure disappears , giving place to oscillations of frequency @xmath69 and constant amplitude @xmath177 .",
    "+ in conclusion we have obtained approximate analytic solutions for the blcoh - redfield equations of dissipative spins in a driving field .",
    "the complex structure presented by the effective bath spectral density brings a richer dynamical behavior for the spin trapped in a quantum dot .",
    "we showed that the existence of the peak in the spectral density introduces a new temporal scale in the problem , @xmath92 , the peak s width , which clearly separates distinct time evolutions of the component @xmath88 . the first one , short times , @xmath178 , is basically determined by the characteristics of the peak .",
    "we saw that the oscillations presented in this regime have their natural frequencies shifted by the bath resonance , @xmath33 , and their lifetimes are determined by @xmath92 .",
    "thus , in principle , this regime could be used to infer intrinsic quantities of the system - bath coupling , such as the electron - phonon constant @xmath155 . on the other hand ,",
    "the long time regime , @xmath179 , was shown to be governed by the external fields .",
    "we found that the relaxation rate @xmath25 for this regime presents a strong peak for frequencies close to the bath resonance , revealing the signature of the effective spectral density .",
    "in addition , we were able to identify the shift induced by the system - bath coupling in the natural frequencies of the system .",
    "we found that this shift , @xmath104 , has the form of a temperature dependent lamb shift @xcite +",
