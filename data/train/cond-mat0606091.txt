    "single - molecule magnets are metal - organic clusters containing a magnetic core surrounded by a shell of organic ligands which isolates the clusters from one another ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the most studied is mn@xmath2 , whose core contains eight mn@xmath3 and four mn@xmath4 ions strongly coupled via super - exchange interactions .",
    "this gives a ground state spin @xmath5 , while the large jahn - teller distortion on the mn@xmath3 sites leads to a strong uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "the energy levels have a bistable structure @xmath6 ( at zero field ) with an energy barrier @xmath7k to be overcome for the spin reversal . at low temperatures ,",
    "these systems show the typical behaviors of superparamagnets , such as blocking or hysteresis , yet at a much smaller scale of size .",
    "in addition , they form molecular crystals in which all molecules are nearly identical and , in the case of mn@xmath2 acetate , have their anisotropy axes @xmath8 parallel to the crystallographic @xmath9 axis .",
    "these properties make molecular magnets model systems to investigate whether quantum phenomena , like tunneling , survive in mesoscopic systems @xcite . as is well - known , tunneling probabilities decrease exponentially with the height of the barrier to be tunneled through ( height that grows with the system size ) @xcite . at the same time",
    ", external perturbations can induce decoherence that degrades the quantum behavior @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an external magnetic field @xmath10 detunes energetically the initial and final states for tunneling ( i.e. , those having @xmath11 and @xmath12 spin projections along @xmath8 ) .",
    "actually , many experiments have shown that tunneling takes place at those fields where states of opposite orientation are degenerate , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 with @xmath15oe in mn@xmath2 ) , whereas it is suppressed for intermediate fields @xcite .",
    "such a _ resonant _ tunneling enables the spins to approach faster their equilibrium state , giving rise to steps in the hysteresis loops around @xmath16 @xcite and to maxima in the linear dynamical susceptibility @xmath17 . in our previous work @xcite , we found that resonant tunneling at @xmath18 induces an extra contribution to the nonlinear response @xmath19 , making it larger ( in magnitude ) than the equilibrium one and having peaks reversed with respect to the classical predictions @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite the dependence of the response on temperature , frequency , and orientation at zero field was studied . in this article",
    "we show how the tunneling contribution to the nonlinear response can be switched on and off by varying an external field , tuning and breaking successively the resonances .",
    "single crystals of mn@xmath2 acetate were grown following the same procedure described in @xcite . in order to increase the signal ,",
    "the magnetic measurements were done on a collection of oriented and glued crystals . in our previous experiments",
    "@xcite we extracted the zero - field @xmath20 by fitting the dc field dependent @xmath21 to a parabola .",
    "clearly , this method is not applicable to study how @xmath19 depends on the external magnetic field itself .",
    "for this reason , in the present experiments we resorted to the more traditional method of measuring non - linear susceptibilities by detecting the different harmonics @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the response . in the absence of bias field",
    "one had @xmath24 ( see below ) .",
    "a nonzero @xmath10 , however , makes @xmath25 the leading nonlinear term , and we will mainly focus on it .    the fields , both dc and ac , were applied _",
    "parallel _ to the common anisotropy direction @xmath8 of the clusters .",
    "we employed the susceptibility option of a commercial multipurpose measuring platform ( ppms ) which uses a conventional inductive method .",
    "it enables applying ac fields of amplitude @xmath26oe , and to selectively detect several harmonics of the exciting frequency @xmath27khz . to separate the intrinsic nonlinear response of the sample from the possible contamination due to non - perfect harmonicity of the exciting ac coil , we measured the output signals @xmath28 and @xmath29 at several @xmath30 .",
    "this gives the sought - for intrinsic contributions @xmath25 and @xmath19 as the terms proportional to @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "an example of this procedure is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the so - measured linear and nonlinear susceptibilities of mn@xmath2 at @xmath32k are shown in fig .",
    "the frequency - dependent @xmath17 shows maxima near the resonant fields , where it approaches the equilibrium @xmath33 .",
    "we also display ( panel b ) the second and third harmonic components measured at @xmath34khz .",
    "( the high noise - to - signal ratio prevented from obtaining reliable @xmath19 data for @xmath35koe . ) the _ equilibrium _ nonlinear susceptibilities , also shown , were obtained differentiating @xmath33 , measured at the lowest frequency @xmath36hz .",
    "we clearly see that the magnitudes of the harmonics increase in the neighborhood of the resonant fields @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where states of opposite @xmath40 are degenerate and the tunnel channels open . besides , in contrast with the behavior of @xmath17 , both @xmath25 and @xmath19 become , near @xmath41 , larger than @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "thus , when resonant tunnel sets on , the multi - harmonic response of these molecular clusters is enhanced .    in order to understand these results we have derived simple expressions for the susceptibilities .",
    "this was done by solving , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , a system of balance equations for the net population of the two anisotropy potential wells : @xmath44 the equilibrium @xmath45 are the derivatives of the magnetization curve , while @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are the relaxation time and its corresponding field - derivatives ( all evaluated at the working field @xmath10 ) . at @xmath18",
    "we have @xmath49 [ since @xmath50 as well as @xmath51 [ from @xmath52 .",
    "then @xmath53 as @xmath54 , while in @xmath19 the last two terms vanish . therefore these equations extend the expressions of ref .",
    "@xcite to nonzero bias fields .",
    "the first eq .",
    "( [ x1:debye ] ) gives the ratio @xmath55 .",
    "besides @xmath17 depends , via the product @xmath56 , on how far the spins are from thermal equilibrium .",
    "by contrast , the nonlinear susceptibilities @xmath25 and @xmath19 include also terms depending on @xmath47 and @xmath48 , i.e. , on how sensitive @xmath46 is to changes of @xmath10 . as a result ,",
    "the relaxation time does not simply `` renormalize frequency '' , as occurs with @xmath17 , but it modifies the magnitudes of the nonlinear responses .",
    "this effect is missed in modelizations of the nonlinear susceptibility that fail to include the field derivatives of @xmath46 @xcite . as we discuss next , extending our arguments at @xmath18 of @xcite , it is this property that makes the quantum @xmath25 and @xmath19 qualitatively different from the classical ones .    according to eq .",
    "( [ x1:debye ] ) , the relaxation time of the magnetic clusters can be estimated from @xmath17 as @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the real and imaginary components of the first harmonic .",
    "this @xmath46 is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "the data show minima at the resonant fields , in contrast with the monotonous behaviour of @xmath46 in classical spins . at zero field and finite temperatures , mn@xmath2 spins",
    "are able to tunnel between those excited magnetic states ( @xmath60@xmath61 ) for which such process is not blocked by the internal bias caused by dipolar and hyperfine interactions @xcite .",
    "this results in a effective barrier reduced by a few magnetic levels , say @xmath62 , so that the thermo - activated relaxation gets faster ( @xmath63k ) .",
    "tunneling is however suppressed as soon as the external bias @xmath64 exceeds the tunnel splitting @xmath65 , slowing down the relaxation ( the full barrier has to be overcome ) . as a result , @xmath46 is minimum at zero field , whence @xmath66 , while @xmath47 changes sign from @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "the same features are repeated every time the field brings magnetic levels again into resonance @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , tunneling becomes , at any crossing field , an additional source of nonlinear response via @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "besides , accounting for the signs of the @xmath46 derivatives and eqs .",
    "( [ x1:debye ] ) and  ( [ x3:debye ] ) , one sees that the sign of the nonlinear susceptibilities can be reversed with respect to the classical ones .",
    "( in the classical model @xmath46 decreases monotonically with increasing field @xcite , inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , giving @xmath70 and @xmath71 for any @xmath10 ; the same occurs in a quantum thermoactivation model not including the possibility of tunneling @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting that both behaviors can be obtained in our case just varying the external field . for fields between resonances ,",
    "tunneling becomes blocked for _ all _ states and the spins reverse by thermal activation over the total ( `` classical '' ) energy barrier .",
    "but when a crossing field is approached , the strong nonlinearity of @xmath46 shows up with its characteristic contribution to the nonlinear susceptibilities via @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    to confirm this interpretation",
    "we have computed the nonlinear responses from eqs .",
    "( [ x1:debye ] ) and  ( [ x3:debye ] ) but incorporating the relaxation time obtained by solving a pauli quantum master equation ( as in ref .  ) .    the results ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) show that the quantum contribution to @xmath22 is dominant near the resonances .",
    "this is due to the smallness of the tunnel splitting of the relevant states for our mn@xmath2 sample : @xmath72k and @xmath73k .",
    "this means that the fields required to block tunnel via these levels , albeit relatively small ( @xmath74oe and @xmath75oe , respectively ) , give rise to relatively large changes in @xmath46 , and hence , large @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in the `` classical '' regime , by contrast , the scale of change of @xmath46 is determined by the anisotropy field @xmath76 . as this is very large in mn@xmath2 ( @xmath77koe ) , one has a comparatively slow decrease of @xmath46 with @xmath10 .",
    "this correspond to small values of the derivatives @xmath47 and @xmath48 and in turn of the classical ( non - tunnel ) nonlinear susceptibilities .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the tunnel splittings , which determine the width of the @xmath46 vs @xmath10 resonances , are further broadened by dipolar and hyperfine interactions @xcite .",
    "in fact , the master - equation calculations tell us that tunneling via lower lying states would give rise to enormous spikes in @xmath25 ( @xmath78k for the ground state ) .",
    "however , these peaks are also very fragile , being easily suppressed by environmental bias fields and therefore not observed experimentally .",
    "we have studied experimentally the nonlinear susceptibilities of a mn@xmath2 acetate molecular magnet in the presence of a longitudinal field @xmath10 . the standard method of measuring the harmonics of the response to an oscillating field @xmath79 has been employed . by using several amplitudes @xmath80 we managed to isolate the genuine nonlinear susceptibilities @xmath25 and @xmath19 ( oscillating with @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) . the low signal - to - noise ratio ( in spite of gluing several single crystals ) prevented from obtaining good @xmath19 data ; fortunately , we obtained nice curves for @xmath25 , which is the leading nonlinear term when a bias field is applied .",
    "the analysis and interpretation of the susceptibility curves was done with help from expressions derived with a simple system of balance equations ( for the potential well populations ) . at variance with previous formulae ,",
    "the field derivatives of the magnetic relaxation time are captured by our expressions .",
    "this , together with the known strong effect on @xmath83 of resonant tunneling near the barrier top , permitted to understand the experimental phenomenology .",
    "we also plugged in those equations the @xmath83 obtained solving a pauli quantum master equation for mn@xmath2 , supporting this interpretation .",
    "near the resonant fields @xmath84 ( matching the levels at both wells ) the @xmath25 vs.  @xmath10 curves neatly amplify the resonant tunnel , as this entails large @xmath85 . for fields in between the @xmath84 s ,",
    "tunnel is blocked and the response is governed by the thermo - activation over the total barrier , as in the classical case .",
    "this does not give such large @xmath47 , while its sign is reversed with respect to the tunnel contribution .",
    "thus the sensitivity of @xmath25 to the local features of the @xmath83 curve provides an alternative method to asses if tunneling plays a role in the relaxation of a superparamagnet ; and if so , in which field ranges it does take place ."
