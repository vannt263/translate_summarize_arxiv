    "the knowledge of the strangeness @xmath5 two - baryon interactions has become an important issue for theoretical and experimental studies of the strangeness nuclear physics .",
    "moreover , this is an important piece of a more fundamental problem , the description of the interaction of the different members of the baryon octet in a unified way .",
    "the @xmath6 interaction accounts for the existence of doubly strange hypernuclei , which is a gateway to strange hadronic matter .",
    "strangeness @xmath0 baryon - baryon interactions also account for a possible six - quark @xmath7-dibaryon , which has yet to be experimentally observed .",
    "its knowledge is naturally invaluable for the quantitative predictions for various aspects of neutron star matter .",
    "there has been an steady progress towards the @xmath5 baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "the @xmath8 interaction is pretty much understood based on the experimental data of @xmath9 hypernuclei .",
    "there is also some progress made on the @xmath10 interaction .",
    "however , the experimental knowledge on the @xmath11 and hyperon - hyperon ( @xmath12 ) interactions is quite poor .",
    "the only information available came from doubly strange hypernuclei , suggesting that the @xmath13 @xmath4 interaction should be moderately attractive .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath14 mev has been deduced for an hypothetical @xmath7-dibaryon ( a lower limit of @xmath15 mev/@xmath16 for its mass ) from the so - called nagara event  @xcite at a 90% confidence level .",
    "the kek - e176/e373 hybrid emulsion experiments observed other events corresponding to double@xmath17 hypernuclei . among them , the demachi - yanagi  @xcite , identified as @xmath18be drove a value of @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "a new observed double-@xmath9 event has been recently reported by the kek - e373 experiment , the hida event  @xcite , although with uncertainties on its nature it has been interpreted as an observation of the ground state of the @xmath20be  @xcite .",
    "very recently , doubly strange baryon - baryon scattering data at low energies were deduced for the first time , obtaining some experimental data and upper limits for different elastic and inelastic cross sections : @xmath21 and @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "recent results of the kek - ps e522 experiment indicates the possibility of a @xmath7-dibaryon as a resonance state with a mass range between the @xmath4 and @xmath3 thresholds  @xcite .    in the planned experiments at j - parc  @xcite , dozens of emulsions events for double@xmath17 hypernuclei will be produced .",
    "the @xmath23 reaction is one of the most promising ways of studying doubly strange systems .",
    "@xmath4 hypernuclei can be produced through the reaction @xmath24 followed by @xmath25 .",
    "it is therefore compulsory having theoretical predictions concerning the @xmath26 coupling  @xcite to guide the experimental way and , in a symbiotic manner , to use the new experimental data as a feedback of our theoretical knowledge .",
    "such a process may shed light on our understanding of the nature of @xmath27 symmetry breaking in the baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "knowledge of the strangeness @xmath0 sector is therefore a challenge for understanding the baryon - baryon interaction in a unified way .",
    "the chiral constituent quark model has been very successful in the simultaneous description of the baryon - baryon interaction and the baryon spectrum as well as in the study of the two- and three - baryon bound - state problem for the nonstrange sector  @xcite . a generalization to the strange sector",
    "has been applied to study the meson and baryon spectra  @xcite , giving a nice description of the hyperon - nucleon elastic and inelastic cross sections , and valuable predictions for the strangeness @xmath2 three - baryon systems : @xmath28  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will apply the same model to derive the strangeness @xmath0 baryon - baryon interactions : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath3 .",
    "we will use these two - body interactions to calculate two - body elastic and inelastic scattering cross sections and we will compare to experimental data and other theoretical models .",
    "we will also calculate the two - body scattering lengths of the different spin - isospin channels to compare with other theoretical models .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in the next section",
    "we will resume the basic aspects of the two - body interactions and we will present the integral equations for the different two - body systems . in section  [ res ]",
    "we present our results compared to other models and the available experimental data .",
    "finally , in section  [ sum ] we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "the baryon - baryon interactions involved in the study of the coupled @xmath32 system are obtained from the chiral constituent quark model  @xcite . in this model baryons",
    "are described as clusters of three interacting massive ( constituent ) quarks , the mass coming from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "the first ingredient of the quark - quark interaction is a confining potential ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "perturbative aspects of qcd are taken into account by means of a one - gluon potential ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry gives rise to boson exchanges between quarks .",
    "in particular , there appear pseudoscalar boson exchanges and their corresponding scalar partners  @xcite .",
    "thus , the quark - quark interaction will read : @xmath35where the @xmath36 and @xmath37 indices are associated with @xmath36 and @xmath37 quarks respectively , and @xmath38 stands for the interquark distance .",
    "@xmath39 denotes the pseudoscalar meson - exchange interaction and @xmath40 stands for the scalar meson - exchange potential described in ref .",
    "explicit expressions of all the interacting potentials and a more detailed discussion of the model can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in order to derive the local @xmath41 potentials from the basic @xmath42 interaction defined above",
    "we use a born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "explicitly , the potential is calculated as follows ,    @xmath43    where    @xmath44    in the last expression the quark coordinates are integrated out keeping @xmath45 fixed , the resulting interaction being a function of the @xmath46 relative distance .",
    "the wave function @xmath47 for the two - baryon system is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "if we consider the system of two baryons @xmath48 and @xmath49 with strangeness @xmath0 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , in a relative @xmath53state interacting through a potential @xmath54 that contains a tensor force , then there is a coupling to the @xmath55 @xmath56wave so that the lippmann - schwinger equation for the spin singlet channels of table  [ ta ] is of the form    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the two - body amplitude , @xmath37 , @xmath36 , and @xmath59 are the total angular momentum , isospin and invariant energy of the system , and , for example , for @xmath60 the subscripts @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 take the values @xmath29 , @xmath64 and @xmath31 , and similarly for the @xmath65 and @xmath66 channels shown in table  [ ta ] .    for the spin triplet channels of table  [ ta ] the lippmann - schwinger equation is of the form ,    @xmath67    with @xmath68 the reduced mass of the system and the on - shell momenta @xmath69 are defined as @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the masses of the particles of channel @xmath63 .",
    "we now turn to the available low - energy data on the @xmath73 scattering .",
    "there is only a small amount of data corresponding to the total cross sections for @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 reactions .    in the case of processes of the type @xmath77 the amplitudes obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and  ( [ eq2 ] ) are related to the cross section for a given isospin state through , @xmath78 from the isospin cross sections the physical channels are determined through , @xmath79 in the case of the process @xmath80 it is necessary to include also the transition with @xmath81 in the @xmath29 channel .",
    "thus , in that case the cross section for isospin @xmath60 is @xmath82 and the cross section for the physical channel is @xmath83 finally , for the elastic @xmath84 process we have @xmath85",
    "our results for the scattering cross sections are depicted by the solid lines in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] ,  [ fig2 ] ,  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] , compared to the available experimental data .",

    "[ fig1 ] the @xmath86 elastic cross section compared to the in - medium experimental @xmath86 cross section around @xmath87 550 mev / c , where @xmath88 30 @xmath89 6.7 @xmath90 mb  @xcite . another analysis using the eikonal approximation gives @xmath88 20.9 @xmath89 4.5 @xmath91 mb  @xcite .",
    "a more recent experimental analysis  @xcite for the low energy @xmath86 elastic and @xmath92 total cross sections in the range 0.2 gev / c to 0.8 gev / c shows that the former is less than 24 mb at 90% confidence level and the latter of the order of several mb , respectively . in fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] shows the total inelastic cross section @xmath96 . combining the results of refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , one obtains @xmath97 mb .",
    "a recent measurement of a quasifree @xmath98 reaction in emulsion plates yielded @xmath99 mb for the total inelastic cross section in the momentum range @xmath100 gev/@xmath93  @xcite , consistent with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite . the experimental results for @xmath86 inelastic scattering of refs .",
    "@xcite involve both @xmath92 and @xmath101  @xcite , what combined with the value for @xmath25 of ref .",
    "@xcite allows to obtain an estimate of the inelastic cross section @xmath96 . finally in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we present our prediction for the @xmath29 scattering cross section . in this last case",
    "there are no experimental data .",
    "as can be seen our results agree with the experimental data for the elastic and inelastic @xmath11 cross sections .",
    "the small bumps in the cross sections correspond to the opening of inelastic channels .",
    "as explained above , the interacting model is taken for grant from ref .",
    "@xcite , where three body systems with strangeness @xmath2 were studied , involving therefore two - body subsystems with strangeness @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the agreement with the experimental data gives support to the dynamical model used and make our predictions valuable for forthcoming experiments .",
    "we would like to emphasize the agreement of our results with the @xmath92 conversion cross section .",
    "this reaction is of particular importance in assessing the stability of @xmath102 quasi - particle states in nuclei .",
    "our results are close to the estimations of the nijmegen - d model  @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite predicts @xmath103 15 mb at @xmath870.5 gev/@xmath93 .",
    "@xcite reported 14 mb for the inelastic scattering involving both @xmath92 and @xmath96 .",
    "we found a smaller value of approximately 6 mb for both inelastic channels , in close agreement to experiment . in the case of the elastic @xmath4 cross section",
    "there are no experimental data .",
    "our predictions are rather similar to refs .",
    "we definitely need more experimental data with high statistics . this will help us in discriminating among the different dynamical models .",
    "a theoretical evaluation of the in - medium cross sections would also be necessary .",
    "the scattering lengths for the different spin - isospin channels are given in table  [ tb ] .",
    "these parameters are complex for the @xmath3 @xmath104 since the inelastic @xmath29 channel is open , for the @xmath105 isospin 1 channel due to the opening of the @xmath3 channel , and for the @xmath106 @xmath1070 and 1 since the @xmath4 and @xmath3 channels are open in the first case , and the @xmath3 and @xmath30 are open in the second ( see table  [ ta ] )",
    ". there is no direct comparison between our results and those of ref .  @xcite .",
    "although both are quark - model based results , ref .",
    "@xcite used an old - fashioned quark - model interacting potential .",
    "for example , they use a huge strong coupling constant , @xmath108 , and they consider the contribution of vector mesons what could give rise to double counting problems  @xcite . as explicitly written in ref .",
    "@xcite , the parameters are effective in their approach and has very little to do with qcd . as mentioned above , since the observation of the nagara event  @xcite it is generally accepted that the @xmath4 interaction is only moderately attractive .",
    "our result for the @xmath13 @xmath4 scattering length is compatible with such event .",
    "a rough estimate of @xmath109 ) drives a value of 5.41 mev , below the upper limit extracted from the nagara event , @xmath110 mev .",
    "moreover , although from the @xmath4 scattering length alone one can not draw any conclusion on the magnitude of the two-@xmath9 separation energy , recent estimates  @xcite have reproduced the two-@xmath9 separation energy , defined as @xmath111 , with scattering lengths of @xmath112 fm .",
    "the only reliable way to determine the two-@xmath9 separation energy in our model would be a concrete calculation of doubly - strange hypernuclei .",
    "this has not been done so far , and it is not clear that such calculation might help to further constrain the potential model .",
    "in this letter we have presented the first results for the doubly strange @xmath50 and @xmath51 interactions ( @xmath52 ) obtained with a constituent quark model approach designed to study the non - strange hadron phenomenology .",
    "the interaction incorporates long - ranged meson - exchange contributions and the short - range dynamics generated by the one - gluon exchange and quark antisymmetry contributions .",
    "we showed that the ccqm predictions are consistent with the recently obtained doubly strange elastic and inelastic scattering cross sections .",
    "in particular , our results are compatible with the @xmath92 conversion cross section , important in assessing the stability of @xmath102 quasi - particle states in nuclei .",
    "furthermore a moderately attractive @xmath4 interaction arises .",
    "the presently available scattering data are , however , not sufficient to draw definitive conclusions about the model , but forthcoming experimental data of the observables reported will help in testing different theoretical model predictions .",
    "it is expected that in the coming years better - quality data on the fundamental @xmath64 and @xmath12 interactions as well as much information about the physics of hypernuclei will become available at the new facilities j - parc ( tokai , japan ) and fair ( darmstadt , germany ) .",
    "the ccqm developed here can then be used to analyze these upcoming data in a model - independent way .",
