    "in fact , reflection - only models ( @xmath113 value of less than 0 ) yield fully acceptable fits ( with reduced @xmath114 ) without the need for any direct component .",

    ", we find _ direct _ evidence of ct obscuration in the form of a flat hard x - ray ( 340 kev ) continuum which can be modeled as arising from reflection off optically thick circumnuclear gas self - consistently with the strong neutral fe line .",
    "although the source was selected from optical spectroscopy , the derived intrinsic x - ray power also places mrk  34 in ( or very near ) the regime associated with obscured x - ray quasars ( @xmath118  erg  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "whereas local ct seyfert 2s have been studied at lower x - ray luminosities for many years , this is the first time that such a robust measurement of the intrinsic x - ray power is possible for a powerful sdss - selected qso2 .",
    "mrk 34 is thus a gold standard  ct qso2 , satisfying all the above characteristics typically associated with this class .",

    "the photon indices of the two fits also allow for some variation in the intrinsic pl slope . despite these uncertainties ,",
    "it is noteworthy that the corresponding absorption - corrected x - ray luminosities of the two model fits differ only by a factor of 2 , at @xmath120  erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the observed hard x - ray spectrum is dominated by the reflection component at all energies , so the modeled intrinsic luminosity is mainly dependent upon the observed flux and the covering factor of the reflector and is less sensitive to the reflecting gas column or the intrinsic pl shape that produces the reflection spectrum .",
    "in other words , the model fits likely provide a good estimate of the intrinsic power of the agn , but only a lower limit on the torus column density .",
    "a systematically different obscuring geometry could yield a different result , of course , and this may be investigated using the decoupled  mode of  @xcite . with differing normalizations and/or column densities for the transmitted and scattered components ,",
    "this mode can be interpreted as an approximate parametrization of alternate geometries such as a patchy torus or of differing elemental abundances .",
    "but it is difficult to constrain such decoupled models for mrk  34 because the intrinsic continuum is not obviously visible at any energy , leading to a large degeneracy on the reflection fraction .",
    "in fact , including separate edge - on and face - on scattering / fluorescence components with a free multiplicative scaling between them in the  fit ( as recommended by @xcite ) leads to the scattering component completely dominating over the intrinsic pl by large factors ( @xmath5100 ) suggesting much higher values of ( los ) than the lower confidence ranges that we presently constrain .",
    "additional checks on the intrinsic power can be provided by indirect multiwavelength relations .",
    "these are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : correlations ] , the top panel of which plots the  vs.  relation for mrk  34 along with the three other sdss - qso2s observed by  so far @xcite .",
    "the latter objects were selected from sources at @xmath121 with /  @xmath122 and sample a range of about one dex in .",
    "the intrinsic @xmath43 for mrk  34 matches well with the infrared : x - ray luminosity relation by @xcite , lying within the 1-@xmath56 relation scatter .",
    "the same holds true when using other relations published in @xcite and @xcite which effectively include varying levels of host galaxy contamination to the mid - infrared .",
    "although high angular resolution infrared imaging ( e.g. @xcite ) is not available for mrk  34 , we note that the _ wise _ mid - infrared color of the source from the all - sky catalog is @xmath123 , placing the source comfortably inside the color zone identified by @xcite where the mid - infrared flux is likely to be agn - dominated . in other words ,",
    "the close match to the correlation in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : correlations ] is entirely attributable to the agn power alone .",
    "the same figure also shows the  vs.  plane .",
    "mrk  34 lies at the threshold of the 1-@xmath56 scatter of the relation defined by @xcite , and the source position is approximately similar with respect to the mean and scatter defined by other relations ( e.g. @xcite ) . _",
    "intrinsic _  luminosities are also shown for the two -detected sources , and are corrected for galactic reddening @xcite . for mrk  34 , we were able to additionally correct for reddening in the narrow - line - region of the host galaxy , following the procedure of @xcite .",
    "for this , we measured the balmer decrement from the  and  narrow line fluxes provided by the sdss spzline pipeline output @xcite . a ratio of @xmath124 is measured=10.47 according to @xcite , which may be a result of differing slit positioning and setup .",
    "we use the more recent sdss measurements here . ] , which translates into an  dereddening factor of 2.3 .",
    "this correction is not possible for the sources from @xcite because their higher redshift means that  lies beyond the sdss wavelength range .",
    "according to the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : correlations ] , there is a mild suggestion that mrk  34 may have a higher  still , but it is difficult to provide a precise cross - check given the large scatter associated with most :  correlations .",
    "finally , with an isotropic megamaser power @xmath125@xmath510@xmath126  @xcite , mrk  34 now also lies within the scatter of the possible relationship between @xmath125 and @xmath43 proposed by @xcite .",
    "these authors identified two maser complexes in mrk  34 consistent with symmetric blue- and redshifted high - velocity ( @xmath5500 km s@xmath3 ) emission .",
    "this is consistent with maser excitation resulting from x - ray irradiation of accretion disk gas .",
    "higher intrinsic x - ray luminosities would push the source beyond the scatter of the proposed @xmath125:@xmath43 relation .    in short",
    ", these multiwavelength comparisons suggest that our x - ray spectral analysis reliably captures the intrinsic x - ray power of mrk  34 .",
    "a compilation of luminosities from our  modeling and over the various wavelength bands discussed above is presented in table  [ tab : lum ] .      when compared to the total infrared power of @xmath127  @xmath128  erg  s@xmath3 as probed by , @xmath129/@xmath130 .",
    "for any typical agn bolometric correction factor @xmath131/@xmath132 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the agn easily has enough power to drive the bulk of the infrared emission .",
    "lirgs ( with @xmath133  @xmath134  ) generally show a much lower fractional agn contribution to the infrared ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and mrk  34 appears to be more similar to palomar - green qsos in this respect @xcite .",
    "the high current luminosity of mrk34 may simply represent an upward fluctuation in an otherwise more modest accretion history ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although a significant ongoing gas accretion rate is required in order to drive the observed power : @xmath135  yr@xmath3 ( assuming an x - ray bolometric correction of 15 and accretion efficiency @xmath136 ) .",
    "there is no secure measurement of the supermassive black hole mass ( ) for mrk  34 as yet .",
    "although a megamaser has been detected , there is no corresponding spatially resolved map so its inner radius is unknown .",
    "however , if we assume that the megamaser disk in mrk  34 has an inner radius of @xmath137  pc as seen in other nearby sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the observed 500  km  s@xmath3 maser velocity @xcite would imply  @xmath138  . extrapolating the galaxy stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath56 ) from the  emission line width and using the @xmath56 relation from @xcite , @xcite instead estimate  @xmath139  . on the other hand , @xcite measure @xmath56=@xmath1405kms@xmath3 from their analysis of the sdss spectra , and using this velocity dispersion together with the updated @xmath56 relation from @xcite would imply  @xmath141  .",
    "if we assume that a range of  @xmath142  reasonably encompasses the current uncertainty on , and combine the intrinsic x - ray power that we measure with typical agn bolometric correction factors quoted above , we find that the agn is radiating at an eddington fraction of @xmath143 .",
    "better data are clearly needed for more precise measurements of .",
    "a very long baseline interferometry map of the megamaser would resolve the inner disk radius , and hence provide a measure of . at the distance of mrk  34 , a physical scale of 0.5  pc corresponds to an angular size of @xmath144  mas , which is within range of the synthesized beam sizes currently available @xcite .",
    "alternatively , high - quality near - infrared imaging with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( ) or the future _ james webb space telescope",
