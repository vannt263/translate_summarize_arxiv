    "it has been suggested to explore the possible mass modifications of d mesons with the fair project at gsi @xcite .",
    "it is planned to study such effects by detecting d mesons in heavy - ion reactions but also in antiproton - nucleus reactions .",
    "the two approaches are complementary , with the second focusing on the properties of d mesons in cold nuclear matter .",
    "thus it is of importance to develop a thorough theoretical understanding of how the d mesons may change their properties in nuclear matter .    at present",
    "there are only few works published on the properties of non - strange d mesons @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there is no attempt to predict the properties of the strange @xmath4 mesons in nuclear matter so far . except for the work by tolos et al .",
    "@xcite mean field parameterizations were considered .",
    "the model by tsushima et al .",
    "@xcite arrived at attractive mass shifts for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons of about 60 mev at saturation density .",
    "a different mean field ansatz by sibirtsev at al .",
    "@xcite that considers also vector mean field contributions suggests an attractive mass shift of about 140 mev for the @xmath1 meson , but a small repulsive mass shift of about 20 mev for the @xmath2 meson . a qcd sum rule analysis of hayashigaki @xcite predicted an attractive mass shift of about 50 mev for the @xmath5 meson .",
    "these developments resemble to some extent the first attempts to predict the properties of kaons and antikaons in nuclear matter ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which also assumed a mean field type behavior for the mass shifts in nuclear matter .",
    "however , by now it is well established that for the antikaon such an ansatz is not valid due to complicated many - body dynamics induced by the presence of resonance - hole states ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus it may be crucial to study also the properties of d mesons in a more microscopic manner .",
    "an important step towards a more realistic approach to the @xmath1 meson in nuclear matter was taken by tolos et al .",
    "@xcite , who did not insist on a mean field approach exploring the possible influence of the @xmath6 resonance on the nuclear dynamics of the @xmath1 meson .",
    "the key ingredient of a realistic description are the @xmath7 scattering amplitudes , that determine the @xmath1 meson self energy at least for dilute nuclear matter @xcite . in turn the results of @xcite",
    "depend decisively on their particular form of the coupled - channel amplitudes that took into account the @xmath8 channels for @xmath9 and @xmath10 channels for @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath6 resonance which carries @xmath12 quantum numbers was dynamically generated in @xcite as suggested first in @xcite .",
    "the interaction strengths were derived relying on a su(3 ) symmetry for the u , d and c quarks . as a consequence of their amplitudes an attractive mass shift of about 10 mev together with a significant broadening of the @xmath1 is predicted at nuclear saturation density was predicted .",
    "recently a more complete computation @xcite that incorporated the additional channels @xmath13 for @xmath9 and @xmath14 for @xmath11 arrived at scattering amplitudes that differ significantly from those of @xcite .",
    "the interaction was saturated by a t - channel vector meson exchange . comparing the different interactions @xcite the work by tolos et al .",
    "severely overestimates the charm - exchange channels . in @xcite those channels",
    "are suppressed by a kinematical factor @xmath15 . as an important new result of @xcite the @xmath9 amplitude shows two resonance structures around 2.6 gev .",
    "a narrow state that couples dominantly to the @xmath16 channels and a broader state that is interpreted as a chiral excitation of the open - charm sextet @xmath17 ground states @xcite .",
    "the narrow state should be identified with the observed state @xmath6 .",
    "the broader one , which couples strongly to the @xmath18 channels , awaits experimental confirmation and couples very weakly to the @xmath19 channel .",
    "it is the analogue of the @xmath20 , which is a chiral excitation of the baryon octet @xmath17 ground states ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to @xcite the isospin one amplitude of @xcite reflects a narrow resonance of mass 2.62 gev which couples dominantly to the @xmath21 channels .",
    "this additional resonance will affect the properties of @xmath1 mesons in nuclear matter significantly .",

    "thirdly , we present for the first time predictions on how the strange @xmath4 mesons change their properties in a dense nuclear environment . again",
    "the scattering amplitudes as obtained in @xcite are used .",
    "the s - wave @xmath23 scattering amplitudes are characterized by exotic resonances at 2.89 gev and 2.78 gev .",
    "the computations are based on the self consistent and covariant many - body approach developed in @xcite .",
    "it is important to perform such computations in a self consistent manner since the feedback of an altered meson spectral function on the resonance structure proved to be a decisive many - body affect @xcite .",
    "in this section we recall the self consistent and relativistic many - body framework required for the evaluation of the pseudo - scalar meson propagation in nuclear matter @xcite .",
