    "the shape of a trapped dipolar condensate  @xcite and its stability against collapse  @xcite have been investigated .",
    "the dynamics  @xcite has been studied theoretically , but recently also experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the generation of novel phases with topological order using polar molecules has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "a recent review of the field can be found in ref .  .",
    "the strength of the ddi can be characterized by the dipolar length @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the mass of the dipolar atom or molecule and @xmath5 is proportional to the square of the dipole moment . for magnetic moments , @xmath6 is usually much smaller than for electric dipole moments of molecules , which can range to thousands of  . since achieving bec with heteronuclear molecules is much harder than with homonuclear molecules , er@xmath7 is a promising candiate to reach a much stronger ddi regime with purely magnetic dipole moments  @xcite .    the two - dimensional limit of a dipolar bose gas ( dbg ) polarized perpendicularly to the plane has been studied extensively by quantum monte carlo methods @xcite for a wide range of dimensionless densities @xmath8 , including high densities where the dipole - dipole repulsion leads to such strong in - plane correlations that the excitation spectrum exhibits a roton similar to the roton in superfluid @xmath9he , and even higher densities where the ground state of the 2d dbg is a triangular crystal .",
    "such large @xmath8 may soon be in experimental reach because @xmath6 can be very large , as mentioned above .",
    "for the 2d dbg with _ tilted _ polarization a stripe phase has been predicted recently for sufficiently large tilt angle  @xcite . also",
    "the more complicated case of a quasi-2d layer was studied , i.e. of a dbg in a one - dimensional trap @xmath10 . the finite extent in this direction",
    "allows pairs of particles to explore the anisotropy of the ddi . already by using the mean field approach of the gross - pitaevskii equation , `` rotonization '' of a quasi-2d layer of a polarized dbg was found to occur if the strength of the ddi surpasses a critical value with respect to the short - range repulsion@xcite .",
    "the roton in this case is not a signature of the repulsive correlations as in the 2d limit for high densities , but a signature of the attractive correlations for head - to - tail configurations of pairs of dipoles .",
    "we have shown this conclusively in ref .  , where even a cross - over between these two kinds of rotons was demonstrated by variation of the trap length . while the effect of attractive correlations on the excitation spectrum can be qualitatively described by mean field methods that optimize only the ground state density by the ritz variational principle , repulsive correlations leading to @xmath9he - like rotons require the optimization of at least density and _ pair _ density .",
    "this is exactly what the family of hypernetted chain euler - lagrange ( hnc - el ) methods does .",
    "the hnc - el method was therefore used in ref .   in order to investigate both kinds of rotons .",
    "a summary of how hnc - el works is given in the next section , all details about the method can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    "we extend our previous investigation of a single quasi-2d dbg layer  @xcite to a bilayer .",
    "the coupling between layers via the long - ranged ddi and the possibility of pairing of dipoles on different layers to form dimers ( and more generally of @xmath11 bound dipoles in @xmath11 layers ) has been investigated previously  @xcite .",
    "superfluidity of fermionic bilayers was studied in ref .",
    "the bound and scattering states of just two dipoles on different layers have been studied  @xcite as well .",
    "our bilayer is realized by a one - dimensional double well potential @xmath12 a dbg in this trap is homogenous and infinitely large in @xmath13 and @xmath14direction and finite in the confinement direction @xmath15 .",
    "the dipole moments are aligned along the @xmath15direction , therefore the dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) potential takes the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the angle between the dipoles @xmath18 and @xmath19 measured from the @xmath15axis , and @xmath20 . to stabilize the system against collapse",
    "@xcite we add a hard core repulsion , that is modeled by a @xmath21 potential .",
    "the hamiltonian describing this many  body system , in the reduced length and energy units , @xmath3 and @xmath22 respectively , looks as follows : @xmath23 correspondingly , we give all values for energy , length , wave number , and density in units of @xmath24 , @xmath6 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ; hence all quantities in tables and figures are dimensionless .    in previous work",
    "@xcite it was established that a translationally invariant single layer of a dbg in a one dimensional harmonic trap can become unstable due to the attractive part of the interaction . the pair distribution calculated in ref .   shows that this instability can be understood as a dimerization , where two dipoles can form a bound state ; such weakly bound dipoles would not be stable and indeed experiments with @xmath0cr  @xcite and @xmath2er  @xcite observe a collapse of the bec for traps that are too wide in the polarization direction .",
    "similarly , two coupled layers can become unstable not only due to the attractive interaction within a layer , but also due to the attraction between dipoles in different layers .",
    "this latter `` instability '' actually indicates the dimerization of dipoles in different layers . as long as the barrier between the layers is high enough that the two bound dipoles remain in their respective layer ,",
    "such a dimerized phase would be stable .",
    "we have studied the dbg in the trap potential  ( [ eq : uext ] ) for various potential parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 that control the barrier height between the wells , their separation , and their individual width .",

    "we note that , although the average of the ddi over the whole plane vanishes , two dipoles on different two - dimensional planes separated by a distance @xmath35 always dimerize , i.e. form a weakly bound state due to the attractive head - to - tail well of the ddi , regardless of the value of @xmath35  @xcite . hence in the zero density limit",
    ", the ground state is always dimerized . at finite density ,",
    "our calculations in the 2d limit show that dimerization is suppressed by many - body effects  @xcite .",
    "in other words , increasing the density in the two layers stabilizes the monomer phase .",
    "ground state properties of bose gases can be calculated using various methods , such as the gross  pitaevskii method  @xcite and quantum monte carlo methods  @xcite .",
    "the gross  pitaevskii method is widely applied for dilute systems , where the correlations between particles are sufficiently weak such that the interaction between them can be approximated by an effective mean potential felt by each particle .",

    "[ fig::woint2-slice2 ] shows , for trap parameters @xmath125 and @xmath126 , a slice of @xmath127 at @xmath131 , which is slightly below the value of @xmath63 where the sharp dispersion curve merges into the damping regime and thus becomes broad ( see full @xmath127 map in fig .",

    "the vertical lines are the undamped peaks of the sharp dispersion .",
    "we see that @xmath127 has only one broadened peak without inter - layer ddi , while the inclusion of the inter - layer ddi leads to two broadened peaks .",
    "we stress again that for parallel momentum transfer , @xmath119 only probes the lower , even mode , hence the two broad peaks are _ not _ due to the splitting of a degenerate eigenmode ( @xmath127 for non - parallel momentum transfer is presented below ) .    as @xmath63",

    "[ fig::woint2.7 ] we compare @xmath119 with and without inter - layer ddi for even closer layers ( @xmath125 and @xmath133 ) .",

    ", the dispersion ( blue line ) has a small slope at @xmath134 , i.e. the system is close to `` rotonization '' .",
    "note that the residual splitting of the dispersion without inter - layer ddi is due to tunneling and the short - range repulsion as mentioned above .",
    "parallel momentum transfer only probes those excitations which are even with respect to inversion at the @xmath135-plane , because a perturbation independent of @xmath15 is even and therefore can not excite odd modes . in order to probe odd modes",
    ", we study @xmath110 for wave vectors @xmath109 with an arbitrary angle @xmath88 with respect to the @xmath135-plane .",
    "[ fig : theta2.7 ] shows @xmath110 for @xmath136 , for trap parameters @xmath125 and @xmath133 .",
    "we plot @xmath110 as a function of @xmath63 , not @xmath137 , since only @xmath63 is a good quantum number that is meaningful for characterizing the excitation spectrum .",
    "unlike in all previous figures of @xmath110 , we now add an artificial small imaginary part @xmath138 to the energy @xmath114 which slightly broadens all features of @xmath110 .",
    "the rationale behind this broadening is that it makes the spectral weight of peaks with zero intrinsic linewidth visible .",
    "the case @xmath139 was shown already in fig.[fig : skw2x3 ] ( without artificial damping ) , and is shown here again for better comparison with @xmath140 . for @xmath139 indeed only the lowest , even mode is visible .",
    "as @xmath88 is increased , a second mode becomes visible and gains weight . for @xmath141 ,",
    "both modes can be seen equally clear in @xmath110 where they appear as a narrow dark trace .",
    "note that the second , odd mode is damped for small @xmath63 .",
    "this is very different from the low-@xmath63 behavior of the lowest mode ( sound mode ) which is not damped because of its negative curvature .",
    "the damping of the second mode can be seen as a broadening ( in addition to the artificial broadening ) for @xmath142 .",
    "we introduce the damping limit @xmath143 which is the energy above which an excitation of parallel wave number @xmath63 can decay into two modes with perpendicular wave number @xmath11 and @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath143 is given by @xmath144\\ ] ] where , due to the limitations of the cbf - bw approximation , @xmath145 are the excitation energies in bijl - feynman approximation , not the excitation energies following from cbf - bw itself ( inclusion of triplet correlations has been shown for homogeneous systems to lead to a self - consistent formulation of the self - energy , see ref .",
    "even modes can decay into combinations where @xmath146 is even and vice versa for odd modes . since we are interested only in decays of the lowest two modes , we obtain three decay limits , which fulfill @xmath147 .",
    "they are shown in fig.[fig : theta2.7 ] as dashed lines .",
    "the lowest mode can decay into @xmath148 and @xmath149 and the second mode can decay into @xmath150 . the effect of these respective limits are clearly seen in fig.[fig : theta2.7 ] .",
    "damping indeed sets in as the dispersion relation of the mode crosses the damping limit with a symmetry appropriate for the mode .",
    "also visible in fig.[fig : theta2.7 ] are interference patterns that lead to a modulation of the intensity of @xmath110 as @xmath63 and thus @xmath151 is increased .",
    "these are simply due to the perpendicular wave number @xmath152 being in phase or out of phase with even or odd modes .",
    "for example , a value of @xmath153 , where @xmath35 is a measure for the distance between the layers , leads to a cancellation of the intensity for even modes , but to a maximal intensity for odd modes .",
    "in this work we generalized our previous studies  @xcite of dipolar bose gas layers from a single layer in a harmonic trap to double - well traps which results in a bilayer geometry .",
    "as in our previous work , the bilayer calculations are based on the hnc - el method for the many - body ground state and on the cbf - bw method for excitations .",
    "dipolar bilayers have a richer structure than single layers owing to the inter - layer dipole coupling .",
    "the possibility of head - to - tail pairing of two dipoles on different layers leads to similar rotonization effects in the non - paired ( monomer ) phase as previously predicted in single layers .",
    "we restricted ourselves to the calculation of ground state correlations of the monomer phase , as well as its excitation spectrum , including damping due to decay of excitations into two lower excitations .",
    "we systematically varied the double - well trap parameters between two close , but thin layers and two well separated , but wide layers , while keeping the total area density fixed at a modest @xmath51 .",
    "the two end points of the range of trap parameters are marked by instabilities of the monomer phase . either if layers are too close or if one layer is too wide , inter - layer or intra - layer dimerization occurs , respectively .",
    "the latter kind of dimers are not stable and would quickly collapse via 3-body collisions , but inter - layer dimers are stable , given a sufficiently high double well barrier . the propensity to pairing",
    "was clearly seen in the monomer pair distribution functions @xmath72 or @xmath71 , which are the normalized probabilities to find two dipoles in different or the same layers , respectively , at a parallel distance @xmath76 .",
    "we showed that , at @xmath77 , @xmath72 grows a peak for small interlayer distance , while @xmath71 grows one if each single layer is sufficiently wide . in both cases ,",
    "the peak of @xmath154 is a precursor to the pairing of two dipoles in head - to - tail orientation .",
    "we presented calculation of the dynamic structure function @xmath110 in the cbf - bw approximation .",
    "@xmath110 for parallel momentum transfer probes only even modes , where we are mostly interested in the lowest one .",
    "@xmath110 typically consists of a lower , undamped peak ( that vanishes for higher @xmath63 ) and two broad peaks that are due the inter - layer ddi coupling ( without it , there is only one broad peak ) , which also enhances damping .",
    "the double - peak structure is not to be confused with the more trivial effect that each mode is split into two because the inter - layer ddi lifts its degeneracy .",
    "the rich structure of @xmath127 is not captured by the simple bijl - feynman approximation which would predict a single , undamped peak for the lowest mode .",
    "the intra- and inter - layer instabilities of the monomer phase are characterized by a bending of the dispersion relation of the lowest ( intra - layer dimer ) or lowest two ( inter - layer dimer ) excitation modes .",
    "this bending , that is less pronounced but still visible in the bijl - feynman approximation , indicates `` rotonization '' , which is well - studied for single layers . as in our previous work on single layers",
    ", we found that the iterative procedure to solve the nonlinear set of hnc - el equations becomes unstable as we approach rotonization , i.e. as the dispersion relation starts to have a local minimum at finite @xmath63 .",
    "this leads to the conjecture that the ground state is only metastable when the excitation spectrum exhibits a roton , while the true ground state , i.e. the state of lowest energy is the ( intra- or inter - layer ) dimerized phase . for a proof of this conjecture",
    ", however , one would need to compare our monomer results with results for the dimerized phase to find out which state has the lowest energy .",
    "finally , we also presented results for non - parallel momentum transfer , i.e. where the angle between @xmath109 and the plane of the layers is non - zero .",
    "the dynamic structure function depends on both the parallel and perpendicular components of @xmath109 , @xmath63 and @xmath152 .",
    "@xmath63 still is a good quantum number , while the non - zero @xmath152 allows to probe also odd modes , particularly the second excitation mode .",
    "showing @xmath110 as function of the parallel wave number , the second mode becomes clearly visible for e.g. an angle @xmath155 . unlike the lowest mode",
    ", the second mode is damped for small @xmath63 due to decay into two excitations of lower energy .",
    "an interesting topic are the correlations of the monomer phase and its excitations generalized to @xmath42 layers .",
    "the long - ranged ddi coupling between different layers for example lifts an @xmath42-fold degeneracy of the excitation spectrum and opens many possible decay channels for the resulting @xmath42 modes .",
    "another direction is the study of `` unbalanced '' bilayers where the two layers have different area densities , or bilayers with different kinds of particles ( e.g. different mass ) on each layer .",
    "if for example the density in one layer is very low , the ddi interaction with the other layer would constitute a very well controlled model of an impurity particle moving in one layer , coupled to a bath of particles in the other layer .",
    "the mechanism how an impurity attains an effective mass could be investigated in a well - controlled fashion over a much wider range of densities and interaction strengths than in condensed matter systems .",
