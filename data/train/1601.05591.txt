    "networks are important models of dynamical systems both in quantum and classical physics with applications ranging from many - body physics and communication technology to social sciences and economics @xcite .",
    "the rapid advancement of quantum information technology @xcite has stimulated considerable interest in dynamical properties of quantum networks formed by elementary systems , such as qubits , in view of their privileged role in quantum communication and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "in particular , qubit based quantum networks may even model characteristic features of a future quantum internet and of the resulting intricate possibilities of generating and distributing entanglement among its nodes . in a typical model of a quantum internet @xcite",
    "distinguishable quantum systems , such as material qubits realized by trapped ions or atoms , are coupled by photon exchange through optical fibers .",
    "these nodes may influence each other by directed entanglement operations which typically involve a control and a target system and are thus representable by directed links . at any time",
    "the users of such a quantum internet can establish links between these nodes . from the point of view of the physical systems constituting the nodes",
    "the establishment of user-controlled connections and subsequently executed entanglement operations may appear random so that a quantum internet may be viewed as a paradigm of a random quantum communication network .",
    "other important examples of quantum networks include systems and processes encountered in quantum statistical physics which involve approaches to equilibria or stationary states in macroscopic systems .",
    "recently , intriguing relations between properties of quantum communication networks with prescribed lattice topologies and statistical physics have been reported .",
    "based on classical percolation concepts @xcite it has been shown @xcite that these quantum networks may exhibit an entanglement percolation phase transition @xcite . accordingly , it requires a minimal critical amount of local entanglement in order to establish an almost perfect distant quantum channel through such a network . this early result on quantum networks and its connection to statistical physics",
    "@xcite stimulates natural questions concerning the existence and character of topological and dynamical properties of other quantum networks .",
    "here we address two such questions elucidating characteristic properties of quantum networks with randomly established links and without any particular prescribed lattice topology @xcite .",
    "the first question addresses the random establishment of directed links which may capture the asymmetric role played by control and target nodes in entanglement creating operations , for example : what is the typical topological structure of random networks with directed links which can be established with equal probability between any two nodes ? answering this question constitutes a first step towards an understanding of generic features of entanglement generation and distribution within such random quantum networks . for this purpose",
    "we develop an iterative method for determining the probability that a random directed graph describing such a random network is strongly connected for any edge - establishing probability @xmath0 . as a main result",
    "it is demonstrated that almost certainly a sufficiently large random network with directed links is strongly connected , i.e. there is always at least one closed directed path through any pair of nodes .",
    "our second question addresses consequences of this typical topological property on dynamical features : does this typical topological property imply universal asymptotic dynamical features on randomly generated quantum networks ? based on previous results @xcite it is demonstrated that such universal properties arise . as an example the asymptotic dynamics of iteratively and randomly applied entanglement operations",
    "is investigated and it is shown that it is independent of most of the details of the underlying randomly generated qubit network .",
    "in particular the individual connectivity of the networks nodes is not the crucial feature for the asymptotics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ chapter 2 ] the iterative procedure is presented for evaluating the probability that a random directed graph with constant edge - generating probability @xmath0 is strongly connected .",
    "based on this result in chapter [ chapter_3 ] the asymptotic dynamics of qubit networks with random unitary evolution is studied . in particular , two different scenarios are investigated , namely a static random network and a dynamically changing random quantum network .",
    "in this section we investigate the connectivity of random directed graphs which describe random networks with a constant edge - generating probability @xmath0 . as a main result",
    "the probabilistic dominance of strongly connected directed graphs is proven in the limit of large networks .",
    "the set of all networks with @xmath1 nodes is characterized by the set of their associated directed graphs @xmath2 .",
    "a graph @xmath3 is defined by its set of vertices @xmath4 representing the network s nodes and by the set of directed edges @xmath5 representing the network s directed links .",
    "a complete graph @xmath6 contains all its @xmath7 possible directed edges .",
    "we focus on directed graphs in order to be able to take into account that any pair of nodes of the network can be linked in an asymmetric way as in the case of an entanglement operation with a control and a target system . a path in a graph is an ordered set of adjacent edges .",
    "a graph is strongly connected if there is at least one closed path through any pair of vertices ( compare with fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "random graphs are a convenient tool for exploring statistical properties of complex networks .",
    "they are defined by a probability distribution on the set @xmath2 . in the following we concentrate on random graphs in which all directed @xmath7 edges",
    "are treated identically , i.e. the links are selected randomly and statistically independently with probability @xmath8 .",
    "thus @xmath9 is the set of directed random graphs @xmath2 of erds - rnyi type @xcite equipped with the corresponding binomial probability distribution .    , * d * - a non - strongly connected graph with two strongly connected components ( grey and blue areas ) . ,",
    "scaledwidth=40.0% ]    a way of classifying topologically the set of random graphs @xmath9 is to determine the probability @xmath10 of a random graph @xmath11 to be strongly connected .",
    "this is a challenging graph theoretical problem already for the simpler case of undirected graphs .",
    "it has not yet been solved completely @xcite . in order to tackle this problem",
    "we have developed an iterative procedure for evaluating this topological graph theoretical quantity @xmath10 .",
    "details of this recurrence procedure are described in the subsequent section .",
    "let us consider directed random graphs with @xmath1 vertices whose probability of establishing an arbitrary link between any pair of these vertices is given by @xmath12 .",
    "the probability that such a graph is not strongly connected is denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "any of these directed graphs can be uniquely decomposed into maximal strongly connected subgraphs , so - called strongly connected dicomponents ( scd ) . unlike in undirected graphs these dicomponents",
    "may be interconnected provided that connections between different scds do not form a directed loop .",
    "note that while each strongly connected graph consists of a single scd only any non strongly connected or disconnected graph with @xmath1 vertices consists of at least two scds .",
    "each of them has strictly less than @xmath1 vertices .",
    "based on these characteristic properties the whole set of directed disconnected graphs with @xmath1 vertices and its associated probability can be constructed by a recursive algorithm described in the following . for this purpose",
    "let us choose a partition @xmath14 of the number of vertices @xmath1 with length @xmath15 .",
    "this is a distribution of @xmath1 vertices into @xmath16 components described by a decreasing sequence of natural numbers , i.e. @xmath17 summing up to @xmath1 .",
    "thereby each partition describes one possible decomposition of @xmath1 vertices into @xmath16 scds . as different links are selected in a statistically independent way the probability that each of these @xmath16 scds is strongly connected is given by the product of the probabilities @xmath18 . in general , in a disconnected graph these @xmath16 scds may be interconnected by directed edges which , however , must not form a closed directed loop .",
    "let us denote the probability that these edges do not form a closed directed loop by @xmath19 .",
    "taking into account all possible distributions of labeled vertices into at least two scds we can determine the probability @xmath20 of a directed graph with @xmath1 vertices being disconnected , i.e. @xmath21 the summation includes all possible partitions @xmath22 of @xmath1 vertices with a minimum length of two .",
    "the number @xmath23 of possible decompositions of @xmath1 labeled vertices within the same partition @xmath14 can be calculated in a straightforward way . however , the determination of the probability @xmath19 is a formidable combinatorial problem which can also be achieved by a recursive procedure described in the following .",
    "this recursive procedure starts from the observation that the absence of any directed loop between different scds implies the existence of at least one scd which is not adjacent to any outgoing edge connecting it with any other scd , i.e. it is not adjacent to any interconnecting edge between different scds whose tail lies in this scd . separating this scd from the rest ,",
    "the residual scds also can not be interconnected by a directed loop . in principle",
    "each scd of the original set of scds could be non - adjacent to any outgoing interconnecting edge into the residual scds .",
    "correspondingly , an upper bound on the probability @xmath24 is given by the sum of probabilities associated with all these ( not necessarily exclusive ) possibilities , i.e. @xmath25 thereby , a scd with @xmath26 vertices and without any outgoing edge is represented by a partition @xmath27 of unit length and the residual scds are represented by the partition @xmath28 of length @xmath29 .",
    "the probability of such a graph is given by the product of the probability @xmath30 that the residual scds are not strongly connected with the probability @xmath31 that the chosen scd with @xmath26 vertices does not have any outgoing edge .",
    "the summation in eq.([expression_acyclic_graphs ] ) includes all @xmath16 scds of the partition @xmath14 .",
    "thus , it takes into account situations with two or more scds , which do not have any outgoing edges , more than once . in order to obtain not only an upper bound but a precise expression for the probability @xmath19 we have to compensate for this overcounting",
    "this can be achieved by subtracting the probabilities describing situations with two scds without any outgoing edges , adding the probabilities of situations with three scds without any outgoing edges and so on .",
    "this way we eventually obtain the recurrence relation    @xmath32    for the probability that the scds described by the partition @xmath14 do not contain any closed directed loops connecting them .",
    "the partition @xmath33 refers to the distribution of vertices of the residual @xmath34 scds after @xmath35 scds without outgoing links to these @xmath34 scds have been separated off .",
    "the sum covers all possible partitions of legth @xmath35 described by the partitions @xmath36 and chosen from the original partition @xmath14 . from the recurrence relations",
    "( [ recurrent_probability_scg ] ) and ( [ probability_acyclic_graphs ] ) the probability of a random graph being disconnected and its complementary probability @xmath10 can be determined recursively .",
    ".probability @xmath37 of a graph being strongly connected . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     employing this recurrence procedure we can calculate the probability @xmath10 . in table",
    "[ table_number_scg ] values of @xmath10 are shown for @xmath38 and for small values of @xmath1 .",
    "these results indicate that for small numbers of vertices @xmath1 it is more likely for a random graph to be non - strongly connected . however , already for @xmath39 it is more likely that a random graph is strongly connected . in fig.[fig2 ]",
    "the probability @xmath10 is depicted for various numbers of vertices @xmath1 and probabilities @xmath0 of randomly establishing edges .",
    "it is apparent that with increasing numbers of vertices @xmath1 the probability @xmath10 approaches unity for any probability @xmath0 .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] suggests a general topological result : in the limit of sufficiently large networks a randomly selected directed graph @xmath40 is almost certainly strongly connected .     for a random directed graph from the set @xmath41",
    "to be strongly connected : @xmath42 ( full , blue ) , @xmath38 ( dotted , red ) , @xmath43 ( dash - dotted , green ) , @xmath44 ( circle , black ) , @xmath45 ( cross , magenta ) , @xmath46 ( diamond , cyan).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    as we show in the following part this main result can be further strengthened quantitatively by a rigorous lower bound of @xmath10 which scales exponentially with the number of vertices @xmath1 .      for large numbers of vertices @xmath1 the analysis of the behavior of the probability @xmath10 based on the recursive relations ( [ recurrent_probability_scg ] ) and ( [ probability_acyclic_graphs ] ) constitutes a challenging task @xcite .",
    "in the following we derive the asymptotic lower bound of @xmath10 @xmath47 which is valid for large numbers of vertices @xmath1 .",
    "it demonstrates that for any probability @xmath48 and sufficiently large numbers of vertices @xmath1 the probability @xmath10 always approaches unity exponentially .    an undirected random graph with @xmath1 vertices , whose probability of establishing an edge between any pair of its vertices is given by @xmath49 . it can be viewed as a special case of a directed graph . in this directed graph",
    "the same pairs of vertices are linked in both directions and the probability for establishing a directed link between any two vertices is given by @xmath48 .",
    "an undirected graph is called connected if any pair of vertices is linked by a path .",
    "apparently connectedness of an undirected graph entails strong connectedness of the associated directed graph and thus yields a lower bound for @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath50 thereby @xmath51 denotes the probability that a random graph with @xmath1 vertices and with probability of edge formation equal to @xmath52 is connected .",
    "establishing a lower bound on @xmath53 is significantly easier than evaluating @xmath10 because connected components of an undirected graph are not mutually interconnected .",
    "hence , the probability that a chosen and fixed vertex lies in a ( connected ) component with @xmath16 vertices is equal to @xmath54 the normalization of this probability distribution yields the relation @xmath55 as the probability @xmath56 that the selected @xmath16 vertices are connected is upper bounded by unity we obtain the lower bound @xmath57 the ratio of two consecutive terms @xmath58 and @xmath59 of this sum is given by @xmath60 it reveals that for sufficiently large values of @xmath1 the largest element of this sum , i.e. @xmath61 , majorizes all other terms .",
    "thus , for a sufficiently large number of vertices @xmath1 the probability @xmath53 fulfills the inequality @xmath62 finally , in view of relation ( [ rel_oriented_vs_nonoriented ] ) we obtain a lower bound for the probability @xmath10 in the form of eq .",
    "( [ lowerbound ] ) .",
    "this lower bound proves that for any probability @xmath0 the quantity @xmath10 approaches the asymptotic value of unity exponentially fast with increasing number of vertices @xmath1 . from fig.[fig2 ] it is also apparent that for each value of @xmath0 the probability @xmath10 attains a minimum as a function of the number of vertices @xmath1 . for smaller values of @xmath0 ,",
    "the probability distribution becomes shallower in the neighborhood of the minimum .",
    "contrary to the macroscopic regime of large networks , i.e. @xmath63 , in the mesoscopic regime of network sizes close to this minimum the probabilistic dominance of strongly connected directed graphs is lost .",
    "it is an interesting issue beyond our scope to explore possible general topological features of random directed graphs also in this mesoscopic regime .",
    "the topological result of sec . [ chapter 2 ] has surprising dynamical consequences .",
    "let us consider a network characterized by a graph @xmath64 whose nodes are formed by distinguishable qubits and whose links represent all possible pairwise couplings between these qubits .",
    "typical quantum information protocols rely on oriented sender(s)-receiver(r ) operations involving frequent entanglement generation . within a future quantum internet with many users such oriented sender - receiver operations along links",
    "@xmath65 are expected to be applied unsupervised , i.e. randomly and independently with probability @xmath66 .",
    "a natural choice for such an oriented sender - receiver operation is the unitary controlled - not ( cnot ) operation @xmath67 with computational basis @xmath68 and with the identity operator @xmath69 of the receiver .",
    "the randomness of the applied cnot operations is captured by the random unitary quantum operation @xcite @xmath70 the density operator of the initially prepared @xmath1-qubit quantum state is denoted by @xmath71 .",
    "recently , it has been shown that if the chosen graph @xmath72 is strongly connected iterations of this quantum operation converge asymptotically towards the state @xcite @xmath73 thereby , @xmath74 is the projection operator onto the subspace spanned by the cnot - invariant pure @xmath1-qubit states @xmath75 and @xmath76 . the probability with which the initially prepared quantum state @xmath71 is in this subspace",
    "is denoted by @xmath77 .",
    "the stationary quantum state @xmath78 is independent of the probability distribution @xmath79 .",
    "furthermore , all strongly connected @xmath1-qubit networks including the completely connected one converge towards this particular quantum state .",
    "thus , it is the topological property of strong connectedness which determines this stationary quantum state .",
    "all other structural properties of the established connections within the qubit network are irrelevant for this universal dynamical property . in a stochastic simulation an individual realization of @xmath80 iterations of the quantum operation",
    "@xmath81 describes a random process in which in each of the @xmath80 steps a new cnot operation is selected randomly along one of the links @xmath82 .",
    "averaging these individual realizations at each step over the probability distribution @xmath79 yields the asymptotic quantum state @xmath78 .",
    "let us now consider a different scenario in which the graph @xmath64 can change randomly and independently between iterations .",
    "the resulting stochastic evolution describes a dynamic random network in which one is ignorant of the actual graph ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to averaging the quantum operation @xmath81 over all randomly generated graphs @xmath83 with the binomial probability distribution @xmath84 generated by @xmath0 .",
    "it is described by the quantum operation @xmath85 iterating this quantum operation drives the @xmath1-qubit network also towards the state @xmath78 .",
    "this universal behavior is due to the fact that this quantum operation @xmath86 may be viewed as a random unitary operation @xmath87 applied along the links of the complete directed graph @xmath6 with @xmath1 vertices .",
    "another stochastic evolution arises if one is ignorant of the graph @xmath11 but this graph @xmath72 remains unchanged during iterations .",
    "this case describes a static random network .",
    "in contrast to the previously discussed cases the @xmath80-th iterate of the corresponding quantum operation @xmath88 is given by @xmath89 according to the recent result of ref .",
    "@xcite the quantum state @xmath90 converges towards @xmath78 if and only if the chosen graph @xmath11 is strongly connected . however , due to the probabilistic dominance of strongly connected graphs within the set @xmath9 the randomly selected graph @xmath72 will almost certainly be strongly connected provided the number of vertices @xmath1 is sufficiently large .",
    "thus , the universal dynamical property of randomly applied cnot operations @xcite combined with the probabilistic dominance of strong connectedness in randomly generated large networks yields the following general result : on a sufficiently large randomly generated @xmath1-qubit network the iterated asymptotic dynamics of randomly applied cnot operations almost certainly converges towards the @xmath1-qubit state @xmath78 of eq.(2 ) .",
    "this state is uniquely determined by the @xmath1 qubits involved and is independent of all further details of the network .",
    "characteristic features demonstrating these universal convergence properties are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig45]a , b .",
    "thereby , the deviations of the @xmath80-th iterate of the quantum operations @xmath91 and @xmath92 from the asymptotic dynamics @xmath93 of a strongly connected graph @xmath72 are investigated .",
    "these quantum operations describe the iterated dynamics of a dynamic and of a static random network . as a state independent measure of these deviations",
    "the hilbert - schmidt distances between these quantum operations are depicted for graphs with @xmath94 vertices and with different probabilities of generating directed links . from fig .",
    "[ fig45]a the strong convergence of the dynamics of dynamic random networks towards the asymptotic dynamics @xmath93 of a strongly connected graph @xmath72 is apparent . as @xmath86 can be viewed as a random unitary quantum operation @xmath95 on a complete graph @xmath96 this is valid even for small network sizes .",
    "however , as apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig45]b the dynamical convergence properties in static random networks are considerably different .",
    "this may be traced back to the fact that in these networks convergence is expected for strongly connected graphs only and that , according to our main result on random directed graphs , strong connectedness arises as a typical property only for sufficiently large graphs .",
    "in summary , we have presented a recursive procedure for evaluating the probability that a random directed graph is strongly connected .",
    "it reveals that for sufficiently small numbers of vertices this probability is small . in this mesoscopic regime",
    "the asymptotic dynamics of qubit networks coupled by random unitary operations , for example , depends strongly on details of the graph characterizing its possible random couplings .",
    "however , large random networks with constant link - generating probability are almost certainly strongly connected .",
    "this typical topological property has important dynamical consequences for quantum networks governed by random unitary couplings , such as entanglement generating controlled - not operations .",
    "irrespective whether their randomness is static or dynamic the probabilistic dominance of strongly connected graphs results in a characteristic long time dynamics .",
    "it is universal in the sense that all strongly connected qubit networks with the same number of nodes share the same long time dynamics independent of all specific differences beyond their strong connectedness .",
    "provided all links of a large network are established with the same probability , the detailed knowledge of the actual network topology is irrelevant and thus consequently redundant .",
    "our lack of such an information is turned into our favor and the network possess a unique asymptotic evolution .",
    "it may be conjectured that similar typical topological properties may also be crucial for capturing the asymptotic dynamics of large quantum networks with dynamics different from the controlled - not operations considered here .",
    "thus , it is conceivable that even highly complex quantum networks , such as a future quantum internet , could exhibit analogous universal topological and dynamical properties .",
