    "axions , the pseudo goldstone bosons , associated with the peccei - quinn symmetry , @xmath0 , remain the most popular solution to the strong cp problem @xcite .",
    "axions , qcd type or some other variant , appear in many extensions of the standard model .",
    "the mass and coupling of the axion is inversely proportional to the scale at which @xmath0 is broken , denoted by @xmath1 , and here after referred to as peccei - quinn ( pq ) scale or axion decay constant interchangeably .",
    "this has important implications for axion cosmology because axions can only be produced thermally when the temperature of the universe drops below @xmath1 .",
    "the pq scale , @xmath1 , is constrained by astrophysics , cosmology and laboratory experiments . for a review of latest bounds on @xmath1 refer to @xcite , while a more comprehensive review / collection of ( earlier ) bounds on @xmath1 can be found in @xcite .",
    "further , axions are also one of the theoretically well motivated contenders for the cold dark matter in the universe .",
    "the dama collaboration has also explored the possibility of scalar and pseudo - scalar interpretation of their results @xcite .",
    "more recently , results from the pvlas experiment @xcite indicate the existence of an axion like particle , though at the moment it is difficult to reconcile any standard axion like particle with these results . for a summary of some of the possible ways out to this difficulty refer to @xcite .    in this note",
    "we would like to study some cosmological implications / effects in the context of axions .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , all the existing studies have ignored the finite temperature effects to axion decay constant while discussing issues like relic axion abundance etc .",
    "we intend to explore the possible impact of such corrections on axion physics at different epochs of the early universe . before proceeding with the finite temperature effects , we fix our notation .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that axions share the basic properties with the pions , notably , the axion coupling to two gluons is given by the anomaly term ( the two photon coupling has an analogous form ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the qcd coupling constant and @xmath4 is the dual of the gluon field defined as @xmath5 where b is the color index .",
    "let us rewrite the above as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the axion coupling which is inversely proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "the axions can be further divided into two categories - ( a ) hadronic axions which couple to quarks only and ( b ) non - hadronic axions having a coupling to the leptons .",
    "mass of hadronic axions is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 mev is the pion decay constant , and @xmath10 is the mass ratio of up and down quarks .",
    "@xmath11 can lie within the interval @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "here we take @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "having noted that the axion coupling to massless gauge bosons is the same as pion - photon - photon coupling , we model the temperature effects in an analogous way as well . to this end",
    ", we first note that the results on chiral dynamics and anomaly at finite temperature @xcite imply the following @xmath14 where @xmath15 mev is the zero temperature pion decay constant measured in the laboratory .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that such a result is valid only for @xmath16 . in the case of axions , it is natural to look at temperatures lower than the axion decay constant as it is only then that the axions can be thermally produced .",
    "therefore , the above result for the pions can be directly extended to the axion case .",
    "the analysis in @xcite however brings out a crucial point .",
    "the effective pion - photon - photon coupling is inversely proportional to the decay constant and one would have expected that the coupling changes the way dictated by the change in decay constant with the temperature , i.e. , one would have expected the coupling to change as @xmath17 or that to @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "what is found instead is that to this order @xmath20 i.e. , @xmath21 we therefore take this form for the axion - gluon - gluon coupling and work with this .",
    "further , following @xcite , we have for the pion mass ( again in the regime @xmath16 ) , @xmath22 note that since the limits on axion mass indicate a very small mass , we do not consider temperature dependent effects for axion mass .",
    "we are now ready to explore two epochs in the history of the universe , particularly important and relevant for axion cosmology .",
    "first , we study axion thermalization and abundance in the very early universe including the temperature effects .",
    "the second case investigated is the axion hadron interactions in the post qcd era . in both these cases we find that the temperature effects - via axion or pion decay constant , pion mass or axion - gluon - gluon coupling , whichever is applicable at the relevant epoch - do lead to change in the results for certain values of the temperatures .",
    "as mentioned earlier , axions can be thermally produced in the universe once the temperature falls below the axion decay constant .",
    "however , axions can also be produced via some non - thermal processes ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in @xcite , the authors identify the conditions under which there is significant production and/or thermalization of axions .",
    "we therefore closely follow @xcite but now include temperature effects as mentioned before .",
    "the main thermalization processes are axion - gluon and axion - quark scatterings . from eq.([decay ] ) and eq.([coupling ] ) , we see that both @xmath1 and @xmath7 decrease with the inclusion of the temperature effects .",
    "this means that the axions can be thermally produced at a slightly lower temperature and the interaction rate also goes down a bit .",
    "the boltzmann equation for the abundance in an expanding universe is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 @xmath25 is the hubble expansion rate and @xmath26 is the thermally averaged rate of reaction of axion processes .",
    "in the radiation dominated era , the friedmann equation yields @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the effective degrees of freedom at the temperature @xmath29 . for a generic process @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , thermally averaged rate is @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 s are the equilibrium distribution functions and @xmath35 is the equilibrium axion number density .",
    "compared to the expression for the thermal averaged interaction rate in @xcite , we will have an extra temperature dependent factor stemming from the correction to the axion - gluon - gluon coupling and the rate now looks @xmath36 @xmath37 is the abundance when axions are in thermal equilibrium with other sm particles . in terms of variables @xmath38 and @xmath39 eq.([abundance ] ) becomes @xmath40 retaining only the leading term , the solution is @xmath41 \\ .\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is a constant determined by boundary condition , @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "this gives @xmath43 at @xmath45 instead of at @xmath46 as the boundary condition and the constant @xmath42 is evaluated accordingly .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] compares the axion abundance with and without the temperature effects taken into consideration for @xmath47 gev .",
    "we see that there is a perceptible change in the abundance for the temperature range ( @xmath48)@xmath49 gev . as a consequence of the shift in the @xmath50 value from unity to @xmath51 , the results in @xcite shift by this factor .",
    "the hadronic axion has no lowest level coupling to the charged leptons and therefore the induced coupling is expected to be small enough to be neglected altogether . for updated bounds on hadronic axion in this context refer to @xcite .",
    "although the exact limits on the mass and decay constant of the axion are model dependent , up to order unity factors , the limits from various sources suggest : @xmath52 gev and @xmath53 ev .",
    "stellar energy loss constraints suggest that in the post qcd era , the axion coupling to electrons and photons are not significant .",
    "the axion coupling to nucleons is constrained by the observed neutrino signal from supernovae 1987a @xcite .",
    "supernovae observations give stringent constraints on the mass and coupling : @xmath54 ev or @xmath55 gev .",
    "however it still leaves a domain for hadronic axion where @xmath1 lies in the range @xmath56 gev and @xmath57 gev @xcite . but this range is disfavored by a detailed combined analysis of hadronic axion with cosmological data like large scale structure , cosmic microwave background , supernova luminosity distances , lyman-@xmath58 forest and hubble parameter @xcite , which obtains the following limits : @xmath59 ev or equivalently @xmath60 gev .",
    "however , in the post qcd era of interest to us here , the number density of the nucleons falls much faster than that of pions and therefore , nucleons can be effectively neglected compared to the pions . that the nucleon contribution to the thermalization and decoupling of axions in this era is much smaller than the pion contribution",
    "has been explicitly verified in @xcite .",
    "the axion - pion interaction is of the form @xcite @xmath61 in hadronic axion models , the coupling constant is @xmath62    the relevant processes are @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "following @xcite , we calculate the axion decoupling temperature in this context but now taking the finite temperature effects in the pion decay constant and mass into account given in eq.([decay ] ) and eq.([mass ] ) respectively ( valid for @xmath65 ) .",
    "the decoupling temperature is that where the hubble expansion rate equals the thermally averaged interaction rate . in the fig.[fig2 ] , we plot the expansion rate of the universe ( @xmath25 ) and the interaction rates ( @xmath26 ) - with and without temperature effects put in .",
    "the points where the @xmath26 curves cut the @xmath25 curve give the decoupling temperature .",
    "this is shown in the figure for @xmath66 gev .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the decoupling temperature is lowered once the finite temperature effects are included and the reason is easy to see . in the epoch of interest , the temperatures are much lower than the axion decay constant and therefore , we do not consider any temperature dependent effects in @xmath1 , while @xmath67 decreases and @xmath68 increases with temperature .",
    "both these effects lead to larger interaction rate and therefore , the axions decouple later in time or at lower temperatures . from the figure , it is also clear that the difference in the two cases is not very large .",
    "we also compare decoupling temperature of axions in the present calculation with the previous ones ( without the temperature effects ) for several representative values of @xmath1 in table [ t ] .",
    "we find that for higher values of @xmath1 , the temperature effects start becoming significant .",
    "however , within the approximation adopted here , it is not possible to explore the range @xmath69 gev as the temperatures exceed the pion decay constant , thus taking us away from the validity of the approximation employed .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate the temperature effects going beyond this approximation and exploring the consequences .",
    ".decoupling temperature of axions @xmath70 ( without ) and @xmath71 ( with ) temperature effects for different values of @xmath72 [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have investigated the impact of temperature effects , though in a limited sense , on the axion cosmology .",
    "we have focused our attention of the temperature effects in the axion decay constant , pion decay constant and pion mass in two important epochs of the universe .",
    "the results show that there can be perceptible differences in the predictions of abundances and decoupling temperatures .",
    "however , we must remark that these effects have been considered in the approximation when the temperature of the universe is lower than the decay constant(s ) . in the case of axion thermalization in the early universe",
    "this has a physical meaning because it is only then that the axions can be thermally produced . in this case",
    "we see some change in the abundance of the axions with temperature . in the case of axion",
    "interacting with pions in the post qcd era , we find that temperature effects in the pion mass and decay constant lead to a lower decoupling temperature for the axions .",
    "we find that as the axion decay constant is increased the difference between the zero temperature and finite temperature cases starts becoming significant .",
    "however , we have worked in the limit when temperatures are smaller than @xmath67 .",
    "this puts a natural limit to the region that we can explore .",
    "it is worthwhile to try to explore what happens when @xmath73 .",
    "this will require going beyond the validity of the present calculation .",
    "we would also like to mention that a more detailed and consistent calculation requires computing the matrix elements including thermal loops also to the same order in temperature corrections and then studying the full impact .    in summary",
    ", we can say that we have studied the impact of temperature effects due to a very limited source(s ) entering the axion cosmology .",
    "the results show perceptible departure from the zero temperature calculations .",
    "let us just compare the situation with the case of neutrino decoupling",
    ". in that case , naively , the temperature effects shift the decoupling temperature by a seemingly small amount . however , for precision studies , such a shift makes a significant difference and hence turns out to be important .",
    "our approach is also guided by this fact .",
    "see @xcite ( and references therein ) for related discussion . whether , finite temperature effects are actually significant and substantial can be decided by more detailed computations , taking into account all sources of corrections to this order .",
    "also , in the case of axion decoupling in the post qcd era , it ll be interesting to try to go beyond the approximation of @xmath65 and include finite temperature effects in the masses and all other parameters entering the expressions .",
    "this can have serious implications for axion cosmology and can lead to very different bounds / limits on various parameters , thereby possibly changing our current understanding .",
