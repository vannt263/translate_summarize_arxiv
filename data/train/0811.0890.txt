    "the anomalous hall effect is the hall effect due to the magnetization in ferromagnets .",

    "recently , it was found that some manganese ferromagnetic pyrochlores can exhibit abnormal anomalous hall effects@xcite different from the conventional ones .",

    "the spin chirality is odd under the time reversal and even under the space inversion .",
    "the scalar chirality becomes a nonzero and gives rise a large anomalous hall effect when the spin configuration is noncoplanar .",
    "the chirality reduces to the spin berry phase in the slowly varying spin structures@xcite .",
    "the spin berry phase and scalar chirality have been shown to induce spontaneous charge current@xcite .",
    "this circulating current was pointed out to be the origin of the hall effect by the spin scalar chirality@xcite . in the context of spintronics , another spin chirality that is associated with the spin current is of particular interest .",
    "this is the vector spin chirality , @xmath8 , carried by non - collinear local spins .",
    "the vector chirality is even under the time reversal and odd under the space inversion .",
    "the vector spin chirality has shown to drive electric polarization in mott insulators through the spin - orbit interaction such as multi - ferroic manganese oxides@xcite .",
    "the aim of the paper is to investigate the role of the vector spin chirality in the anomalous hall effect in metals .",

    "is due to the local spin hall effect , which leads to deviate the electron motion in the opposite sense depending on the electron spin ( represents by the tiny arrow with circles ) .",
    "the spins of the hall effect are opposite in the regions @xmath84 and @xmath85 due to the different sign of the geometry factor .",
    "therefore , global hall effect vanishes if the electron transport is homogeneous . ]    in other words , the hall effect is due to the local spin hall effect@xcite where the electron orbit is deviated by the vector spin chirality in the opposite sense depending on its spin ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "we also note that uniform hall conductivity , given as the spatial integral of @xmath86 , vanishes if the electron transport is homogeneous and if the system size infinity .",
    "in fact , @xmath87 has a property of @xmath88 at the position @xmath89 and this symmetry cancels out the global hall conductivity .",
    "this is explained also in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "when the two local spins are on the @xmath20 axis ( @xmath90 ) , the local hall effects in the regime @xmath84 and @xmath85 have opposite sign due to the opposite sign of the geometrical factor , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , the global hall effect vanishes except in the case where the electron transport is asymmetric withe respect to the spin structure . nevertheless , we believe that finite global hall conductivity can arise in reality , since electron transport is not necessarily uniform and the dominant transport channel can be affected by a net vector chirality .",
    "when the localized spins is slowly varying compared to the conduction electrons , i.e. , @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the spatial scale of the local spin structure , we can expand the local spin as @xmath95 .",
    "the hall conductivity can be then simplified as @xmath96 with the coefficient @xmath97 given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is boltzmann conductivity and @xmath100 is the electron density .",
    "the behavior of the coefficient of @xmath97 depends on the magnitude of the spin polarization , namely , @xmath101 if @xmath102 , and @xmath103 if @xmath104 .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ahc of vector chirality ] ) , we see that the anomalous hall effect is related to the spin current carried by the localized spins .",
    "in fact , the local spin current is given in the static case and in the absent of the spin - orbit interaction as@xcite , @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a constant ( the superscript ( subscript ) of @xmath107 represents the direction in the spin ( real ) space ) .",
    "this spin current is a nonlinear magnetic current of local spins ( and is different from the conventional magnetic current in the electromagnetism , @xmath108 ) .",
    "the local hall conductivity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ahc of vector chirality ] ) is thus written by the rotation of vector spin chirality as @xmath109 . the global hall conductivity",
    "is then written as @xmath110 where @xmath111 denotes the line integral at the boundary .",
    "equation ( [ eq : berry phase curvature ] ) indicates that hall voltage is induced by the rotation of the spin current .",
    "is interpreted as due to the rotational spin current at the boundary associated with the local spin structure . ]",
    "the result of the local hall conductivity , eq .",
    "( [ eq : hall conducutivity-1 ] ) , is very similar to the expression of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is a coefficient and @xmath114 , @xmath115 represent the position .",
    "we therefore expect that the systems having dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction exhibit the hall effect due to the vector spin chirality as @xmath116 .",
    "the vector chirality effect would be seen in the system with helical spin structures such as mnsi @xcite and aufe @xcite .",
    "-@xmath19 plane .",
    "no hall current arises .",
    "( b ) the helical spin structure in the @xmath40-@xmath39 plane .",
    "local hall current is induced .",
    "( c ) the conical spin structure also induces the local hall current . ]",
    "equation ( [ eq : hall conducutivity-1 ] ) has the similar structure as the electric polarization in the magnetic insulator .",
    "in fact , the local vector spin chirality was pointed to induce the polarization @xmath117 as @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is a constant proportional to the spin - orbit interaction and exchange interaction @xcite .",
    "this relation was confirmed experimentally in manganese oxides with helical and conical spin structures@xcite .",
    "one should note that there is a difference between the anomalous hall effect in metals and the spontaneous electric polarization in insulators .",
    "namely , while the spontaneous polarization arises when the spin - orbit interaction is present , the coefficient for the hall effect , @xmath87 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hall conducutivity-1 ] ) , does not contain the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "let us apply our result explicitly to the typical spin structures , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . figure .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) shows the helical spin structure with the spins lying in the plane perpendicular to the current ( @xmath40-direction ) .",
    "the spin is written as @xmath120 , where @xmath121 represents the pitch of the helical structure . in this case",
    ", the vector spin chirality in the @xmath19-direction , @xmath122 , vanishes and therefore the hall effect does not arise . when the helical spins are within the @xmath40-@xmath39 plane ( fig . [ fig:3](b ) ) , spin structure is given as @xmath123 , and the vector chirality is @xmath124 .",
    "similarly , the conical spin structure shown in fig . [ fig:3](c ) , with @xmath125 , ( @xmath126 is a constant ) , results in @xmath124 and finite local hall effect arises .",
    "a typical case where the hall effect arises in the whole sample is the case with a vortex . for a vortex shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , the spin configuration is given as @xmath127 where @xmath128 represent the azimuthal and polar angles in polar coordinates .",
    "the hall conductivity in this case is calculated from eq.([eq : berry phase curvature ] ) , @xmath129 the hall conductivity for the vortex is therefore finite and is proportional to the total vortex number @xmath130 .",
    "finally , we note that the line integral of the spin current in eq .",
    "( [ eq : berry phase curvature ] ) is equivalent to the su(2 ) gauge flux",
    ". the conventional anomalous hall conductivity can be induced by the su(2 ) gauge flux@xcite . in fact , su(2 ) gauge field associated with the spin structure is given as@xcite @xmath131 , and therefore @xmath132 , where @xmath133 indicates the component perpendicular to @xmath38 . the hall conductivity , eq .",
    "( [ eq : berry phase curvature ] ) , is thus written in terms of the perpendicular to component of the su(2 ) gauge flux as @xmath134 the hall effect studied here is therefore interpreted as due to an u(1 ) projection of the su(2 ) phase accumulated by the conductive electron .",
    "one should note that this projection is different from the scalar spin chirality or the spin berry phase case .",
    "the u(1 ) phase governing the scalar chirality is given by the parallel component , @xmath135 , of the gauge field .",
    "we have shown that the anomalous hall conductivity is caused by the vector spin chirality at least locally in the weak @xmath0-@xmath1 ( hund ) coupling limit if the electron has uniform spin polarization , without the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "this anomalous hall effect can be interpreted as due to rotation of the spin current associated with the vector chirality .",
