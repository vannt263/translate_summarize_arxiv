    "electron transport in one - dimensional interacting electron system is not yet fully understood in spite of its simplicity . even in the absence of the potential scattering , until recently it has been believed that the conductance is renormalized by the the long - range interaction like @xmath0 , where @xmath1 for repulsive interaction.@xcite the experiment by tarucha et al .",
    ", @xcite however , indicates that the renormalization is absent , and its has been shown by the present author that the renormalization is the result of the incorrect definition of the conductance.@xcite    he showed that the renormalization can be derived with the use of the self - consistent field method : when a electric potential is applied on the system , the electrons are driven by the self - consistent potential which is reduced because of the screening , while the current is defined as the ratio of the current to the difference of the externally applied potential between the ends of the system .",
    "this wrong definition of the conductance leads to the apparent reduction of the conductance .",
    "in fact , as has been pointed out by izuyama,@xcite the conductance should be defined as the ratio of the current to the difference of the self - consistent potential between the ends of the system , because the self - consistent potential which contains the contributions of the polarization charge is the electric potential observed in the experiments . within the self - consistent field theory , which is equivalent to the exact theory in the present case ,",
    "the response to the self - consistent potential is that of non - interacting electron , and hence the correctly defined conductance is not renormalized .    here it should be noted that the above arguments are correct only when the long - range parts of the interaction potential are taken into account .",
    "it has been argued that the short - range parts are renormalized to 0,@xcite but it is the case only for 0k and infinitely long systems .",
    "in fact , in order to determine whether the renormalization exists , the experiments have to be done at moderate temperatures to avoid the effects of the scattering by impurities or boundary irregularity .",
    "thus it is important to investigate the effects of the short - range part of the interaction on the conductance , and it is the purpose of this paper .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional interacting electron system described by the hamiltonian @xmath2    suppose we apply an electric field @xmath3 along the system , then the current is given by@xcite @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the heisenberg representation of the current operator .",
    "it is easy to see that eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath6 with @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 being an integer , and @xmath10 is obtained by analytic continuation .",
    "we let @xmath11 be the fourier transform of @xmath12 ; @xmath13    in the lowest order in the short - range interaction , there are two kinds of corrections to @xmath11 , namely , vertex correction ( fig.[cor](a ) ) , and self - energy correction ( fig .",
    "[ cor](b ) ) .",
    "the vertex correction is given by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the one - electron green s function ; @xmath16 with @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 being the fermi wave number .",
    "using the standard technique of the thermal green s function method,@xcite we find that @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the fermi distribution function .",
    "we assume that the spatial change of the electric field @xmath22 is very slowly , and we calculate @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "then , for @xmath25 , @xmath26 being the fermi energy , in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ dg2 ] ) only the wave number @xmath27 contribute to the integrals .",
    "since we are interested in the correction due to the short range part of @xmath28 , we consider only the contributions from @xmath29 .",
    "then we easily find that @xmath30 and from eqs .",
    "( [ sigma2 ] ) and ( [ gq ] ) that the vertex correction to the conductivity is given by @xmath31    next we calculate the self - energy correction .",
    "the correction of fig.[cor](b ) is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the self - energy part , which is independent of the energy : @xmath34    together with the contribution of the feynman graph with the self - energy correction to the other one - electron green s function in fig.[cor](b ) , we find that the self - energy correction to @xmath11 is given by    @xmath35\\frac{\\d k}{2\\pi}\\ , ,   \\label{dgs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the primes on @xmath21 denote the derivative with respect to @xmath36 .",
    "the self - energy correction to the conductivity is obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ sigma2 ] ) and ( [ gq ] ) with @xmath11 replaced by @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ dgs ] ) . after some manipulations we find that @xmath38 \\frac{\\d k}{2\\pi}\\ , , \\hspace{-0.5 cm } \\nonumber \\\\         \\label{ds2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the primes indicate the derivative with respect to @xmath39 .",
    "it is easy to see that this equation can be written in the form @xmath40    the derivative of the self - energy part is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ s(k ) ] ) : @xmath41 and for @xmath42 , it follows that @xmath43 where we have neglected the contribution of the term with @xmath28 for @xmath44 .    thus together with eq .",
    "( [ dsig ] ) the correction to the conductivity to the first order in the short - range part of the interaction is given by @xmath45 since the right hand side is independent of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , we find that the correction to the conductance is also given by the right hand side of the above equation .",
    "in this section we show that correction to the conductance obtained in the preceding section can be interpreted as the one due to the correction to the chemical potential difference at the ends of the sample .",
    "the electric potential applied on the system causes the deviation @xmath48 of the electron density from its unperturbed value , and it gives rise to the change in the local chemical potential .",
    "we calculate @xmath49 as the response to the electric potential @xmath50 , with @xmath51 , and we obtain @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the fourier component of @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the density response function:@xcite @xmath56}\\ , .",
    "\\label{r}\\ ] ] then we obtain @xmath57 note that the density of states per spin is @xmath58 . hence the local fermi energy is given by @xmath59 here the fermi energy is measured from the bottom of the band .    on the other hand , the interaction correction to the chemical potential is given by @xmath60 because the change of the self - energy have to be compensated by that of the chemical potential in order to keep the electron density unchanged .",
    "here we assume that the local relation between the ferm energy and the chemical potential holds , i.e. , @xmath61 and then , neglecting the contributions of @xmath28 for @xmath62 , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ def ] ) that @xmath63    the increase of the current due to this correction to the chemical potential difference is given by @xmath64 comparing it with eq .",
    "( [ dst ] ) , we find that the correction to the conductance due to the short - range parts of the interaction potential can be explained in terms of the corrections to the chemical potential at the ends of the system .",
    "therefore , the correction to the conductance can be absorbed into the renormalization of the chemical potential , i.e. , the conductance is not renormalized if we define it as the ratio of the current to the difference of the renormalized chemical potential at the ends of the system .",
    "in the previous paper@xcite , the present author has pointed out that the renormalization of the conductance due to the long - range part of the interaction can be explained in terms of the renormalization of the electric potential .",
    "since the renormalized potential is the one observed in the experiments , the conductance should be defined as the ratio of the current to the difference of the renormalized potential at the ends of the sample .",
    "the conductance defined in this way is not renormalized .    in this paper ,",
    "using kubo formula , we showed that the short - range part of the interaction gives a finite correction to the conductance and that it can be ascribed to the renormalization of the chemical potential .",
    "as in the above , the renormalized chemical potential is the one observed in the experiments , and the conductance should be defined in terms of the renormalized chemical potential . then the conductance is not renormalized also in this case .",
    "although the present arguments are restricted to the lowest order in the interaction potential , we can expect that it is the case to all order .",
    "recently , there are some calculations on the effects of the umklapp scattering . in the umklapp scattering ,",
    "the total momentum of electrons is not conserved , and we can expect a finite correction to the conductance . from the point of view of the present theory , however , some contributions to the correction obtained using kubo formula might be absorbed into the renormalization of the chemical potential .",
