    "general relativity ( gr ) has changed our understanding of spacetime . in parallel ,",
    "the appearance of quantum field theory ( qft ) has modified our view of particles , fields and the measurement process .",
    "the usual approach for the unification of qft and gr , to a quantum gravity , starts with a proposal to quantize gr and its underlying structure , spacetime .",
    "there is a unique opinion in the community about the relation between geometry and quantum theory : the geometry as used in gr is classical and should emerge from a quantum gravity in the limit ( planck s constant tends to zero ) .",
    "most theories went a step further and try to get a spacetime from quantum theory .",
    "then , the model of a smooth manifold is not suitable to describe quantum gravity .",
    "but , there is no sign for a discrete spacetime structure or higher dimensions in current experiments .",
    "hence , quantum gravity based on the concept of a smooth manifold should also able to explain the current problems in the standard cosmological model ( @xmath1cdm ) like the appearance of dark energy / matter , or the correct form of inflation etc .",
    "but before we are going in this direction we will motivate the usage of the good old smooth manifold as our basic concept .    when einstein developed gr , his opinion about the importance of general covariance changed over the years .",
    "in 1914 , he wrote a joint paper with grossmann .",
    "there , he rejected general covariance by the now famous hole argument .",
    "but after a painful year , he again considered general covariance now with the insight that there is no meaning in referring to the _ spacetime point a _ or the _ event a _ , without further specifications .",
    "therefore the measurement of a point without a detailed specification of the whole measurement process is meaningless in gr .",
    "the reason is simply the diffeomorphism - invariance of gr which has tremendous consequences .",
    "furthermore , gr do not depend on the concrete topology of spacetime .",
    "all restrictions on the topology of the spacetime were formulated using additional physical conditions like causality ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this ambiguity increases in the 80 s when the first examples of exotic smoothness structures in dimension 4 were found .",
    "the ( smooth ) atlas of a smooth 4-manifold @xmath2 is called the smoothness structure ( unique up to diffeomorphisms ) .",
    "one would expect that there is only one smooth atlas for @xmath2 , all other possibilities can be transformed into each other by a diffeomorphism .",
    "but in contrast , the deep results of freedman @xcite on the topology of 4-manifolds combined with donaldson s work @xcite gave the first examples of non - diffeomorphic smoothness structures on 4-manifolds including the well - known @xmath3 .",
    "much of the motivation can be found in the fqxi essay @xcite .",
    "here we will discuss another property of the exotic smoothness structure : its quantum geometry .",
    "let us consider the spacetime with topology @xmath0 where the 3-sphere has growing radius .",
    "this spacetime can admit uncountable many , different ( = non - diffeomorphic ) smoothness structures , denoted by @xmath5 ( a first example was constructed in @xcite ) .",
    "for the construction of @xmath5 , one needs a homology 3-sphere @xmath6 , i.e. a compact 3-manifold with the same homology like the 3-sphere . the poincare sphere ( or the dodecahedral space used in cosmology ,",
    "see @xcite ) is an example .",
    "usually , every homology 3-sphere is the boundary of a contractable 4-manifold but not every homology 3-sphere is the boundary of a smooth , contractable 4-manifold .",
    "we used this fact to formulate restrictions on possible smooth spacetimes in cosmology @xcite . for the construction of an exotic @xmath5 one needs the following pieces :    1 .",
    "@xmath7 as cobordism between @xmath6 and its one - point complement @xmath8 and 2 .",
    "@xmath9 as cobordism between @xmath8 and @xmath8 .",
    "then the non - compact 4-manifold @xmath10 ( see @xcite , @xmath11 has reversed orientation ) is homeomorphic to @xmath0 but not diffeomorphic to it , i.e. @xmath12 . but @xmath5 has the topology of @xmath0 , i.e. for every @xmath13 there is a 3-sphere @xmath14 topologically but not smoothly embedded into @xmath5 . or , + _",
    "the 3-sphere @xmath15 is wildly embedded , i.e. it is only represented ( better triangulated ) by infinite many polyhedrons .",
    "the wild 3-sphere is a fractal space . _",
    "+ in @xcite we discussed wild embeddings and its relation to quantum geometry .",
    "we were able to show that the ( deformation ) quantization of a tame embedding ( see the appendix for a definition ) is a wild embedding .",
    "the idea of the proof can be simply expressed in the formalism of gr .",
    "first we consider a tame embedding @xmath16 for a non - exotic spacetime .",
    "the 3-sphere can be triangulated and we consider the 1-skeleton , i.e. a finite graph .",
    "the holonomies along this graph with respect to a suitable connection representing the geometry .",
    "the geometry of @xmath17 can be at least locally approximated by a homogenous ( @xmath18 invariant ) metric ( in the cartan geometry formalism , see @xcite ) .",
    "the observables in this theory ( as the functions over the space of holonomies ) form a poisson algebra @xcite .",
    "the ( deformation ) quantization of this poisson algebra @xcite transformed the graph into a knotted , infinite graph .",
    "as shown by us , this knotted graph is a wild embedding which can be interpreted as the quantum state .",
    "this quantum state contains an infinite number of homogenous metrics , i.e. metrics with different values of the curvature .",
    "then the transition of a wild embedding to a tame embedding is the transition from the quantum state to a classical state which can be interpreted as decoherence .",
    "now we will interpret the wild embedded 3-sphere in cosmology . in our model @xmath19 of the exotic @xmath5 we made a rescaling",
    "so that the 3-sphere at @xmath20 is the initial state of the cosmos ( at the big bang ) , i.e. we assume that the cosmos starts as a small 3-sphere ( of planck radius ) . as we claimed above , this",
    "3-phere is a wildly embedded 3-sphere @xmath21 . in the model ( [ eq : exotic - s3xr ] ) of @xmath19 above we have the part @xmath22 as a cobordism from @xmath8 to @xmath6 and back .",
    "as freedman @xcite showed this cobordism is equivalent to a cobordism from @xmath23 to @xmath6 and back .",
    "but now we can identify the wild @xmath21 ( partly ) with @xmath23 in this cobordism .",
    "but then we obtain a transition from the wild @xmath21 ( the quantum state ) to the homology 3-sphere @xmath6 , which is smoothly embedded @xmath24 . or , @xmath25 and we studied this process in @xcite more carefully . in case of a hyperbolic homology 3-sphere",
    ", we showed that there is a single parameter , a topological invariant @xmath26 of @xmath6 , which characterizes all properties of this process ( [ eq : decoherence ] ) .",
    "hyperbolic @xmath27manifolds for @xmath28 show mostow rigidity , i.e. every diffeomorphism or conformal transformation is an isometry .",
    "therefore the ( unit ) volume @xmath29 and the chern - simons functional ( as integral over the scalar curvature of @xmath6 ) are topological invariants . in @xcite",
    ", we interpreted the process ( [ eq : decoherence ] ) as inflation and calculated the exponential increase to be @xmath30 now we further interpret the process as decoherence of a quantum state ( the wild 3-sphere ) to the classical state ( the tame hyperbolic homology 3-sphere ) .",
    "but then the decoherence time can be calculated from @xcite .",
    "assume the planck time @xmath31 as time scale for the quantum state then we obtain for the decoherence time @xmath32 @xmath33 ( see section 4.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "consider as an example the hyperbolic homology 3-sphere @xmath34 obtained by dehn surgery along the knot @xmath35 ( in rolfson notation ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : knot-8_10 ] .",
    "[ fig : knot-8_10 ] ]    then we obtain the values ( using snappea of j. weeks ) @xmath36 or @xmath37 and the decoherence time @xmath38 according to this model , the cosmos starts in a quantum state ( represented by a wild 3-sphere of planck size ) which undergoes a transition to a homology 3-sphere ( classical state ) by a decoherence process with time @xmath39 .",
    "but what does the model predict for the future evolution ? after the formation of the ( hyperbolic ) homology 3-sphere , the whole spacetime admits a hyperbolic structure ( metric of negative scalar curvature ) . at the same time , the hyperbolic homology 3-sphere changes back to a 3-sphere .",
    "therefore the spatial curvature is positive whereas the curvature of the spacetime is negative , i.e. one has a negative curvature along the time - like component of the curvature .",
    "we will show this fact now .",
    "let @xmath40 be the spacetime for this phase . then using the mostow rigidity ( for the 4-manifold @xmath41 )",
    ", we have a _ constant _ negative scalar curvature @xmath42 for the 4-manifold @xmath41 . the spatial component ( the 3-sphere )",
    "is assumed to carry a metric of constant positive curvature @xmath43 with radius @xmath44 .",
    "for the whole 4-manifold @xmath41 we have the topology of @xmath45 and we choose a product metric of the form @xmath46 with the scaling factor @xmath47 and the homogenuous metric @xmath48 of the 3-sphere ( of unit radius ) .",
    "then one obtains for the ricci tensor @xmath49 ( the dot is the time derivative ) leading to a negative scalar curvature @xmath50 ( in agreement with our setting above ) .",
    "the spatial componentes of the ricci tensor are positive for @xmath51 and negative along the time - like component .",
    "secondly , the spatial scalar curvature ( [ eq : spatial - curvature ] ) is also positive . then according to ( [ eq : exotic - hyperbolic ] ) we obtain @xmath52 with an accelerated expansion .",
    "furthermore we also shown the claim above .",
    "we call @xmath1 the cosmological constant",
    ". this constant can be determined by the expansion rate ( [ eq : expansion - rate ] ) of the inflation .",
    "we assumed a planck - size cosmos at the big bang which grows to a cosmos of size @xmath53 and curvature @xmath54 then the mostow rigidity of the homology 3-sphere @xmath6 implies a constant curvature which determines by the same argument ( now for the 4-manifold ) the curvature @xmath55 to @xmath56 thus we obtain an exponential small expression for the cosmological constant ! for the homology 3-sphere @xmath34 above , we obtain @xmath57 which is not small enough to explain the current value of the cosmological constant .",
    "but there is a lot of freedom to construct a hyperbolic homology 3-sphere from a knot . in particular",
    ", the closing of the knot complement by using a so - called cusp is very important .",
    "therefore , for a @xmath58 dehn - surgery with a special cusp ( generating a geodesic of minimal length @xmath59 ) , we obtain a homology 3-sphere @xmath60 with @xmath61 so that @xmath62 and @xmath63 in cosmology , one usually relate the cosmological constant to the hubble constant @xmath64 and the critical density leading to the length scale @xmath65 the corresponding variable is denoted by @xmath66 and we obtain @xmath67 in units of the critical density and using the planck length @xmath68 . by using the measured value for the hubble constant ( planck sattelite )",
    "@xmath69 we are able to calculate the dark energy density ( as expression for the cosmological constant ) @xmath70 and we obtain only the rough order of the constant ( in contrast to the current value @xmath71 measured by the planck sattelite ) .",
    "the paper discussed a simple model of a cosmic evolution starting with a quantum state ( represented by a wildly embedded 3-sphere ) which changed to a classical state ( tame embedded homology 3-sphere @xmath6 ) . in the model we are able to calculate the decoherence time of the quantum state .",
    "furthermore , we obtain a small cosmological constant with a value which is in qualitative agreement with the current measured value .",
    "the constant value of the cosmological constant can be geometrically understood by mostow rigidity .",
    "we speculate that the correct value of the cosmological should be obtained by a more realistic model including matter coupling .",
    "we call a map @xmath72 between two topological manifolds an embedding if @xmath73 and @xmath74 are homeomorphic to each other . from the differential - topological point of view ,",
    "an embedding is a map @xmath72 with injective differential on each point ( an immersion ) and @xmath73 is diffeomorphic to @xmath74 .",
    "an embedding @xmath75 is _ tame _ if @xmath76 is represented by a finite polyhedron homeomorphic to @xmath73 .",
    "otherwise we call the embedding",
    "_ wild_. there are famous wild embeddings like alexanders horned sphere @xcite or antoine s necklace . in physics",
    "one uses mostly tame embeddings but as cannon mentioned in his overview @xcite , one needs wild embeddings to understand the tame one . as shown by us",
