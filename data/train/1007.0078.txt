    "the prospect of perfect imaging with negative refraction @xcite has initiated the entire research area of metamaterials that , in turn , inspired the development @xcite of transformation optics @xcite , the subject of this special issue . yet ,",
    "ironically , negatively ",
    "refracting lenses have never perfectly worked in practice , only `` poor man s lenses '' , that are substantially thinner than the wavelength , have shown subwavelength imaging @xcite .",
    "the reason is that negative refraction is only possible in highly dispersive and hence highly dissipative materials @xcite ; here absorption does not only reduce the intensity but severely limits the resolution of the , theoretically , perfect lens .",
    "alternatives are hyperlenses @xcite that rely on materials with indefinite metric .",
    "these are anisotropic materials where one of the eigenvalues of the electric permittivity is negative ; these materials thus implement a hyperbolic geometry @xcite ( hence the name hyperlens ) .",
    "hyperlenses are able to funnel out light from near",
    " fields without losing subwavelength detail , but their resolution is given by their geometric dimensions , and is not unlimited .",
    "another example of perfect imaging has been known , as a theoretical idea , since an 1854 paper by maxwell @xcite .",
    "this device , called maxwell s fish eye , because it reminded maxwell of the eyes of fish , uses positive refraction .",
    "maxwell s fish eye focuses all light rays emitted from any point in an exact image point ; it makes a perfect lens for light rays .",
    "luneburg @xcite discovered that it maps light rays in physical space to rays on a virtual sphere , a curved space ; maxwell s fish eye thus is an early example ( and inspiration ) of non  euclidean transformation optics @xcite .",
    "however , it is known since abbe s theory of imaging that the resolution of optical instrument is limited by the wave nature of light @xcite .",
    "ray optics is not sufficient here , especially in curved geometries , unlike in euclidean transformation optics @xcite where geometrical optics @xcite is exact @xcite .",
    "analytic solutions of maxwell s equations for maxwell s fish eye @xcite proved theoretically that perfect imaging is possible with positive refraction and recent experiments @xcite indicate that it also works in practice .",
    "yet perfect imaging with positive refraction @xcite challenges @xcite some of the accepted wisdom @xcite of subwavelength imaging : it does not appear to perform an amplification of evanescent waves @xcite and requires a drain at the image in the stationary regime @xcite . to illuminate some of the perceived paradoxa of perfect imaging , it is instructive to consider the simplest possible case @xcite : imaging with a spherical mirror . in this paper , the imaging with such a mirror",
    "is compared with the imaging in maxwell s fish eye @xcite . exact time ",
    "dependent solutions of maxwell s equations reveal the similarities and characteristic differences between the two cases ; the mirror can not perfectly image , but maxwell s fish eye can .    ]",
    "imagine a point dipole placed at the centre of a spherically symmetric mirror that completely surrounds it ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mirror ] ) .",
    "the dipole emits electromagnetic radiation that reaches the mirror , is reflected there , travels back and focuses at the centre where the dipole sits  the dipole is imaged to itself . due to the symmetry of the sphere",
    ", this is the simplest conceivable imaging problem . within the regime of geometrical optics @xcite ,",
    "the focusing with the mirror would be perfect , but the highly concentrated field in the centre violates the validity condition of geometrical optics @xcite .",
    "therefore , exact calculations of the complete maxwell equations are required for elucidating the imaging performance of the mirror .",
    "the same applies to maxwell s fish eye @xcite where we fill the space enclosed by the mirror with a dielectric material that has a certain radially symmetric graded refractive index @xmath0 . in both cases , the propagation of electromagnetic waves is governed by a length scale , the size of the spherical mirror , and an associated time scale , the travel time of light in the mirror .",
    "our results will only depend on these scales .",
    "therefore , to simplify the algebra , it is wise to measure space in units of the mirror radius ; in these units the mirror surrounds the dipole at radius @xmath1 it is also advantageous to measure the time @xmath2 in units of the distance traveled in free space ; in these units we obtain for the speed of light in vacuum @xmath3 note that in our units the ( angular ) frequency @xmath4 is identical to the wavenumber in empty space .",
    "we consider the propagation of electromagnetic waves in three  dimensional space , a case where the theory is mathematically simpler than in two  dimensional wave propagation . in 3d , however , impedance matching is required for perfect imaging where the electric permittivity @xmath5 equals the magnetic permeability @xmath6 , which is difficult to achieve for materials in practice ( but trivially the case in empty space ) . for the sake of theoretical simplicity we require @xmath7 in empty sphere ,",
    "the refractive index is unity : @xmath8 and in the case when we fill the sphere with maxwell s fish eye we have @xcite @xmath9 equations ( [ mirrorposition])-([max ] ) , together with maxwell s equations of electromagnetism , set the scene for the problem we investigate in this paper : the radiation of a dipole placed at @xmath10 .",
    "but before we address this problem a few ( well  known ) ideas on causality are needed .",
    "maxwell s electromagnetism is completely time ",
    "reversible ; a dipole may emit an electromagnetic wave , but it may as well absorb the same wave run in reverse  by carefully choosing the initial conditions at the boundary an electromagnetic wave may focus at the dipole and be completely absorbed .",
    "the latter solutions of maxwell s equations , where the interaction of the wave with the dipole lies in the future , are called _ advanced _ , whereas the former solutions , where the dipole causes the emission of the wave , are called _ retarded _ ( fig .",
    "[ fig : causality ] ) .",
    "clearly , in our case retarded solutions are required ; they are causal : no radiation is present prior to the event of emission at , say , time @xmath11 .",
    "we thus require for all field quantities @xmath12 : @xmath13    ]    suppose we represent the quantity @xmath12 in terms of its fourier components @xmath14 : @xmath15 the causality condition ( [ causality ] ) is met if @xmath16 is analytic on the upper half complex @xmath4 plane and decays sufficiently fast , such that we can close the integration contour of the fourier integral ( [ fourier ] ) on the upper half plane for @xmath17 when @xmath18 decays for @xmath19 ; if @xmath16 is analytic the closed - contour integral is zero and @xmath12 vanishes for @xmath17 , as required ( fig .  [",
    "fig : contour ] ) .",
    "conversely , in the causal case ( [ causality ] ) we obtain from the inverse fourier transformation @xmath20 that @xmath16 obeys the defining cauchy ",
    "riemann differential equations of analytic functions , because the only frequency ",
    "dependent term @xmath21 in the integral ( [ invfourier ] ) is analytic , provided the integral ( [ invfourier ] ) converges .",
    "convergence is guaranteed , because @xmath22 for @xmath19 and @xmath23 and so the integrand exponentially decays .",
    "furthermore , in the limit @xmath24 the term @xmath21 tends to zero , so @xmath14 decays at @xmath25 on the upper half plane .",
    "we conclude that the fourier transform of causal fields must be analytic and decaying on the upper half plane .",
    "we use this requirement to deduce the causal solutions for our imaging problem .    ]",
    "consider a radially  symmetric impedance  matched medium ( [ medium ] ) inside the spherical mirror at radius ( [ mirrorposition ] ) and suppose that a point dipole is placed at the centre that emits a flash of light . to describe the electromagnetic wave emitted by the dipole we use spherical polar coordinates @xmath26 with @xmath27 axis aligned to the dipole .",
    "we assume that the vector potential @xmath28 of the wave points in the direction of the dipole with an amplitude @xmath29 that only depends on the radius @xmath30 ( our calculations will show that this assumption is consistent with maxwell s equations ) .",
    "the unity vector @xmath31 in @xmath27direction reads in terms of the basis vectors in spherical polars @xcite @xmath32 we thus require @xmath33 however , the vector potential is rather a one  form @xmath34 @xcite ( also known as a covariant vector ) and not the ( contravariant ) vector @xmath35 .",
    "we thus lower the index with the metric of the spherical polar coordinates @xcite and write down the ansatz for the vector potential as @xmath36 we obtain the magnetic field @xmath37 from @xmath38 where for our ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) we calculate the curl in spherical polars @xcite and lower the index @xcite .",
    "we arrive at @xmath39 with the magnetic  field amplitude in the plane of emission ( for @xmath40 ) being @xmath41 we use the symbol @xmath42 to abbreviate the partial derivative @xmath43 and we are going to use @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "the electric field @xmath46 we obtain from maxwell s equation in the medium ( [ medium ] ) @xmath47 with our units ( [ c ] ) and for a point dipole at the centre pointing in @xmath27direction that emits a flash of light at @xmath11 with normalized intensity .",
    "we thus find for the non  vanishing electric ",
    "field components @xmath48 while the azimuthal component @xmath49 is zero .",
    "furthermore , we use faraday s law @xmath50 expressed in spherical polars @xcite with indices lowered @xcite and our result ( [ bs ] ) for the magnetic field , to obtain the wave equation @xmath51 all other components of @xmath52 vanish for the electric field ( [ e ] ) in spherical polars , which reduces the problem to the wave equation ( [ wave ] ) and justifies our ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) .",
    "finally , we require that the mirror acts as an ideal electrical mirror where the electric  field components in the mirror are put to zero , in our case ( [ mirrorposition ] ) @xmath53 which implies from expression ( [ e ] ) that @xmath54 we see that the magnetic field must not change at the mirror . in the following we seek causal solutions of the wave equation ( [ wave ] ) with boundary condition ( [ mirror ] ) for the magnetic field @xmath55 expressed in terms ( [ b ] ) of the vector potential .",
    "first we consider the dipole radiation in empty space surrounded by the spherical mirror @xcite and then we compare this case with maxwell s fish eye @xcite .",
    "in empty space ( [ empty ] ) the left  hand side of the wave equation ( [ wave ] ) for the magnetic field ( [ b ] ) reduces to @xmath56 such that the wave equation ( [ wave ] ) is satisfied if @xmath57 we thus require that the fourier components @xmath58 of the vector potential , with the convention ( [ fourier ] ) for the fourier transform , obey the inhomogeneous wave equation @xmath59 for @xmath60 the general solution of the  then homogeneous  wave equation ( [ mirrorwavefourier ] ) is @xmath61 note again that in our units ( [ c ] ) the frequency @xmath4 is equal to the wave number that normally appears in the spherical waves ( [ sphwaves ] ) .",
    "the first term of expression ( [ sphwaves ] ) describes an outgoing wave and the second term an ingoing wave .",
    "the spherical mirror turns outgoing into ingoing waves and so we expect that the coefficients @xmath62 are not independent . indeed , we obtain from condition ( [ mirror ] ) for the magnetic field ( [ b ] ) of the wave ( [ sphwaves ] ) @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the phase @xmath65 at the mirror ( [ mirrorposition ] ) the outgoing component @xmath66 thus produces the ingoing component @xmath67 and vice versa , apart from the extra phase ( [ delta ] ) .",
    "this phase vanishes for high frequencies @xmath68 where the wavelength approaches zero and imaging becomes perfect , regardless whether it is subwavelength  limited or not .",
    "for finite @xmath4 the phase ( [ delta ] ) is responsible for limiting the resolution of the mirror , as we see next .",
    "so far we considered the general solution of the homogeneous radial wave equation with the boundary condition ( [ mirror ] ) at the mirror .",
    "now we turn to the solution that satisfies the inhomogeneous equation ( [ mirrorwavefourier ] ) and therefore describes the field generated by the point dipole . for this",
    "we write down the following combination of outgoing and ingoing waves ( [ sphwaves ] ) @xmath69 one verifies that this @xmath58 obeys the condition ( [ reflection ] ) of spherical waves reflected by the mirror .",
    "we also see that @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the green function of the poisson equation , @xmath72 in the vicinity of the origin we can ignore features of @xmath58 on the scale of the wavelength that depend on the frequency @xmath4 and so the inhomogeneous wave equation ( [ mirrorwavefourier ] ) reduces to the poisson equation here",
    ". therefore the wave ( [ fouriermirror ] ) with the asymptotics ( [ asymptotics ] ) satisfies the wave equation ( [ mirrorwavefourier ] ) , and we already know that it also obeys the boundary condition ( [ mirror ] ) .",
    "the fourier components ( [ fouriermirror ] ) thus constitute the electromagnetic field of a light flash emitted by a point dipole , provided they are causal , i.e.  analytic and decaying on the upper half @xmath4 plane .",
    "causality is the final point we need to consider for the field ( [ fouriermirror ] ) . representing the sine functions in expression ( [ fouriermirror ] ) in terms of exponentials",
    "we see that @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath58 is analytic , apart from poles @xmath75 on the real axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] ) where @xmath76 the fourier transform @xmath58 also has a quadratic singularity at @xmath77 . in order to obtain a causal solution we must move the poles slightly below the real axis , by providing @xmath4 with an infinitesimal , positive imaginary part .",
    "alternatively , we move the integration contour up from the real axis by an infinitesimal distance ( fig .  [",
    "fig : contour ] ) . in both cases , we can close the contour of the fourier integral ( [ fourier ] ) on the upper half plane for @xmath17 and get zero , as required for causal waves ( [ causality ] ) . for @xmath23",
    "we close the contour on the lower half plane and obtain from cauchy s theorem @xmath78 with the coefficients @xmath79 for the light flash emitted by the dipole in the centre of the mirror , we obtained the exact solution ( [ mirrorfield ] ) with the pole frequencies ( [ poles ] ) and the coefficients ( [ coeff ] ) .",
    "let us investigate the extent to which this wave images the dipole onto itself .    for perfect imaging",
    "we require that an outgoing wave is perfectly converted into an ingoing wave .",
    "the wave is focused at the centre and bounces back and forth with a period of twice the time it takes to travel to the mirror , @xmath80 in our units . as a flash of light",
    "is described by a radial delta function , the flash in a perfectly imaging device should be given in terms of the periodic delta function @xmath81 of period @xmath80 , i.e.  the kernel of the discrete fourier transform @xmath82 at the mirror ( [ mirrorposition ] ) , the wave changes sign and propagates backwards .",
    "we thus require for the radial wave @xmath83 in the case of perfect imaging of the dipole onto itself @xmath84 writing @xmath83 in terms of the periodic delta function @xmath85 guarantees that @xmath83 is periodic with period @xmath80 .",
    "we obtain from expression ( [ periodicdelta ] ) @xmath86 formula ( [ a0series ] ) strongly resembles our result ( [ mirrorfield ] ) for the spherical mirror , but not perfectly . there , instead of the eigenfrequencies @xmath87 the pole frequencies",
    "@xmath75 appear and the trigonometric series ( [ mirrorfield ] ) contains the coefficients @xmath88 .",
    "the poles ( [ poles ] ) depend on the phase ( [ delta ] ) that , for large @xmath4 , approaches @xmath89 . in this limit",
    "we obtain for the poles ( [ poles ] ) @xmath90 that approaches @xmath87 for @xmath91 . in this limit",
    "also @xmath92 , as we see from expression ( [ coeff ] ) .",
    "consequently , whenever large@xmath93 components dominate the series ( [ a0series ] ) of the perfect wave , they also dominate the wave ( [ mirrorfield ] ) in the spherical mirror .",
    "we see from definition ( [ a0 ] ) that this is the case at the infinitely peaked front of the light flash bouncing back and forth in the mirror .",
    "therefore , the perfectly imaging wave makes the dominant contribution to the electromagnetic wave in the spherical mirror .",
    "figure [ fig : reflection ] shows the difference @xmath94 between the vector potential ( [ mirrorfield ] ) of the light reflected in the spherical mirror and perfectly reflected light flashes ( [ a0 ] ) .",
    "relativistic causality implies that the outgoing wave @xmath29 must remain a perfect pulse until it hits the mirror .",
    "therefore the deviation from the ideal vector potential @xmath83 can not correspond to any physical field .",
    "figure ( [ fig : reflection ] ) indicates that , during this stage , @xmath94 is constant in space but grows in time .",
    "this growth must be linear in order for @xmath29 to obey the homogeneous wave equation ( [ mirrorwave ] ) .",
    "as the magnetic field ( [ b ] ) and the electric field ( [ e ] ) depend on the spatial derivative of @xmath29 in the gauge relevant to our ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) , the electromagnetic fields do not deviate from free dipole radiation until the wave hits the mirror .",
    "after the first reflection the wave is no longer a perfect pulse : the vector potential carries an additional discontinuity at the position of the pulse and develops a field in its wake . note that the mirror is not assumed to be dispersive or otherwise imperfect ; these features quantify the imperfections of imaging with an ideal spherical mirror .    ]",
    "now imagine we fill the space enclosed by the mirror with the impedance",
    " matched ( [ medium ] ) medium ( [ max ] ) of maxwell s fish eye @xcite .",
    "this device implements the geometry of a curved space .",
    "in particular , it creates the illusion that light propagates on the 3dimensional surface of the 4dimensional hypersphere @xcite .",
    "it turns out @xcite that the geometry of waves in maxwell s fish eye appears in the clearest possible form if we write the vector potential @xmath29 as @xmath95 or , from definition ( [ b ] ) , @xmath96 we show next that the function @xmath97 is the scalar green function on the hypersphere @xcite . for this",
    "we inspect the left ",
    "hand side of the wave equation ( [ wave ] ) where @xmath98 therefore the wave equation ( [ wave ] ) for the refractive  index profile ( [ max ] ) with @xmath99 is satisfied if @xmath97 obeys @xmath100 or , in cartesian coordinates , @xmath101 this is the conformally  coupled radial scalar wave equation on the virtual space implemented by maxwell s fish eye , the surface of the hypersphere @xcite . if @xmath97 satisfies the boundary condition ( [ mirror ] ) at the mirror in addition to the wave equation ( [ fishwave ] ) @xmath97 is the required scalar green function .",
    "let us construct the green function @xmath97 .",
    "for this we fourier  transform the wave equation ( [ fishwavecartesian ] ) , @xmath102 and obtain for the fourier  transformed radial wave equation : @xmath103 we consider the limit @xmath104 where the far  field terms @xmath105 do not influence the near field of @xmath106 anymore , such that we can replace the left  hand side of the fourier  transformed radial wave equation ( [ fishwavefourier ] ) by @xmath107 if @xmath106 obeys the asymptotics @xmath108 one easily verifies the following expression for the two fundamental solutions of the fourier  transformed wave equation ( [ fishwavefourier ] ) with asymptotics ( [ asympd ] ) : @xmath109 let us write down the expression @xmath110 we see from euler s formula @xmath111 and @xmath112 that expression ( [ dfishstat ] ) is a linear combination of the two fundamental solutions ( [ sole ] ) and hence a solution of the homogeneous wave equation ( [ fishwavefourier ] ) for @xmath113 . additionally , since @xmath114 for @xmath115 expression ( [ dfishstat ] ) obeys the required asymptotics ( [ asympd ] ) for @xmath116 .",
    "furthermore , one verifies that @xmath106 conforms to the boundary condition ( [ mirror ] ) at the mirror , @xmath117 formula ( [ dfishstat ] ) thus qualifies as the fourier transform of a green function .",
    "finally , @xmath106 decays for @xmath118 and is analytic , apart from single poles at @xmath119 and a double pole at @xmath77 .",
    "similar to the case of the empty spherical mirror ( sec .",

    "[ fig : comparison ] ) .    ]",
    "we have seen that maxwell s fish eye faithfully transmits time  dependent signals , it perfectly images in time , but how does it image in space ?",
    "the spherical mirror focuses only one point , the centre , to itself ; an elliptical mirror images one focal point to the other focal point .",
    "maxwell s fish eye is a so  called perfect optical instrument @xcite where all light rays from any source point @xmath127 focus at the corresponding image point @xmath128 .",
    "the fish eye is a perfect instrument for light rays , but the optical resolution of imaging is normally limited by the wave nature of light .",
    "remarkably , one can derive exact solutions of maxwell s equations for electromagnetic waves in maxwell s fish eye @xcite ( that needs to be impedance  matched in 3d ) but the technicalities @xcite involved in justifying and explaining them go beyond the scope of this article .",
    "the principal technical problem is the tensor nature of the electromagnetic field .",
    "fortunately , we can liberate ourselves from the technicalities of tensor analysis and understand the essence of perfect imaging with positive refraction by discussing the scalar green function @xmath97 ; the electromagnetic field can be derived from @xmath97 by certain differential forms @xcite that reduce to expressions ( [ bd ] ) and ( [ e ] ) for the special case of the source being at the centre of maxwell s fish eye . for simplicity , let us also dispense with the mirror and consider the infinitely extended profile ( [ max ] ) for @xmath30 from @xmath129 to @xmath25 . in this case",
    "we write down the fourier ",

    "our result ( [ spot ] ) shows that the electromagnetic wave of a stationary source develops a diffraction  limited image , in agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "however , let us adopt the alternative interpretation of @xmath106 as the fourier transform of a light flash @xmath97 .",
    "we obtain in complete analogy to the calculations in the previous section : @xmath136 \\,.\\ ] ] the flash perfectly focuses at the image point , is reflected there and bounces back to the source etc . in maxwell",
    "s fish eye the image point thus acts like a perfect mirror . in the stationary regime",
    "we can imagine the wave as a continuous stream of light flashes .",
    "each of the elementary flashes is reflected at the image point where its amplitude changes sign . in the stationary regime",
    "we average over the stream of flashes and so the sign change upon reflection causes the image to get blurred .",
    "maxwell s fish eye has the potential of perfect imaging , but this potential is not realized yet .",
    "what is missing is a crucial ingredient of imaging : a detector .",
    "a detector extracts the field at the image point .",
    "an ideal point detector acts as a completely passive outlet with point  like resolution ( infinitely small cross section ) .",
    "such a detector could be part of a ccd array or represent the photosensitive molecule of a photographic material that happens to be at the image point .",
    "suppose the detector is positioned at the point @xmath127 and extracts the radiation incident at that point . in this case",
    "the series ( [ dflashes ] ) of flashes bouncing back and forth reduces to one flash that is emitted at the source and disappears at the image at time @xmath137 in our units : @xmath138 for this expression we obtain the fourier transform @xmath139 note that formula ( [ drun ] ) describes a running wave with complex wave function propagating from the source to the image where the wave disappears , in contrast to the standing wave ( [ dfish ] ) with real wave function that is reflected at the image .",
    "the spatial singularity of @xmath106 for @xmath140 corresponds to a supplementary source at the image point @xmath128 , a drain . as @xmath141 for @xmath140",
    "the wave carries a phase delay of @xmath142 at the image @xcite .",
    "the detector , acting as a drain , creates a perfect spatial image of the source point .",
    "so far , we assumed that the detector is positioned at the correct place .",
    "now imagine the detector is elsewhere .",
    "as the detector has point  like resolution it can only detect a field that is infinitely concentrated at that point .",
    "therefore , an ideal point detector placed at the wrong position will not detect anything ; the perfectly focused field will only appear at the perfectly positioned point detector in agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "of course , the detector may have a non  perfect efficiency such that it does not extract the entire field .",
    "in this case , part of the field is reflected , but the transmitted part is perfectly focused ; the detected image is infinitely sharp . as any continuous distribution of sources can be thought of as a distribution of source points , any source is perfectly imaged , as long as it is detected by a continuous array of point detectors .",
    "only the detected field is imaged with point  like precision , but detection is the very point of imaging .",
    "however , one may still argue that the drain at the image is an artifact that perturbs the field , creating an infinitely focused field entirely on its own , the illusion of perfect imaging but not a true image @xcite .",
    "let us consider a counter example where the introduction of a drain turns out not to improve imaging in time : the spherical mirror .",
    "returning to the starting point of this article , we consider empty space enclosed by the spherical mirror .",
    "we form the following linear combination of the two fundamental solutions ( [ sphwaves ] ) with the reflection condition ( [ reflection ] ) : @xmath143 this expression creates the singularity of the source at the centre and a drain with phase delay @xmath144 in our units for a wave reflected at the mirror with phase shift @xmath145 back to the source in time @xmath146 . however , expression ( [ acausal ] ) also develops poles in the complex frequency plane at the zeros of @xmath147 , i.e.  at @xmath148 on the upper half plane !",
    "therefore , the solution ( [ acausal ] ) is not causal , the drain is not causally connected to the source , but rather acts as an independent source of radiation .",
    "however , as we have seen , maxwell s fish eye makes all the difference here ; in this case the drain is consistent with causality .",
    "an ideal spherical mirror can not perfectly image on its own , the mirror inevitably distorts light pulses ( left of fig .  [",
    "fig : comparison ] ) .",
    "however , if the space enclosed by the mirror is filled with the medium of the impedance  matched maxwell fish eye , pulses are no longer distorted and thus the imaging is perfect in time ( right of fig .  [ fig : comparison ] ) .",
    "we have seen that the introduction of a drain at the image is allowed by causality and leads to perfect imaging in space in the stationary regime ( similar to the perfect focusing of ultrasound waves by time reversal @xcite ) . on the other hand , in imperfect imaging the drain would be in conflict with causality .",
    "one of the puzzles of perfect imaging with positive refraction seems to be resolved .",
    "yet one may still wonder how maxwell s fish eye is able to restore evanescent waves in a similar way negative refraction does @xcite .",
    "but note that the amplification of evanescent waves is not the only physical picture explaining the performance of the negatively  refracting perfect lens ; there is a simple geometrical argument @xcite : the lens performs a folding transformation of space @xcite .",
    "the negative  index lens appears to fold the space perceived by electromagnetic waves such that three regions are identical , one region in front of the device , the lens itself , and the region behind it ( fig .",
