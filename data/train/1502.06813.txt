    "the jet of 3c 273 is nearby ( z = 0.158 ) large - scale jet ( a possible deprojected length is @xmath1 0.654 mpc , harris & krawczynski 2006 ) , this ideal lab of the large - scale jet has been studied through multi - band observations ( e.g. , jester et al .",

    "2001 ; jester et al . 2006 ; uchiyama et al .",
    "2006 ) : a synchrotron low - energy component from radio to optical and a high - energy component including x - rays which of mechanism is still puzzling .",
    "many researchers discuss the merits and demerits of possible mechanisms responsible for the x - ray jet ( e.g. , sambruna et al .",
    "2001 ; uchiyama et al .",
    "2006 ; see harris & krawczynski 2006 , for a review ) . here , we only discuss ic / cmb model for the x - ray jet emission of 3c 273 . the achilles heel of ic / cmb model for the x - ray jet emission is that this model leads to high , even super - eddington kinetic power ( dermer & atoyan 2004 ; uchiyama et al . 2006 ; meyer & georganopoulos , 2014 ) .",
    "we think this problem may be due to the symmetrical assumption of an isotropic pitch - angle distribution , an anisotropic pichi - angle distribution may be more close to real situation . for simplicity",
    "we consider only the symmetric assumpiton .",
    "recently , meyer & georganopoulos ( 2014 ) presents @xmath0 observations rule out the ic / cmb x - ray model entirely for knot a in the 3c 273 jet .",
    "but we have a different answer",
    ".    in @xmath2 2 , we present that ic / cmb model could well explain the large - scale jet x - ray radiation of 3c 273 , and apply ic / cmb model to the individual knots in the 3c 273 jet , which does not violate new @xmath0 observations .",
    "a conclusion is given in @xmath2 3 .",
    "we consider a standard synchrotron scenario ( kardashev 1962 ) in which source particles have a power law distribution , but we think particle spectral index may be a piecewise function , which is due to the complex and nonlinear acceleration ( e.g. , liu & shen , 2007 ; sahayanathan , 2008 ) . for isotropic distributions , the synchrotron flux expression is ( kardashev 1962 ) :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is particle spectral index , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the maximum and minimum cutoff frequencies of synchrotron spectrum .",
    "@xmath7 is the synchrotron break frequency , i.e. , the peak frequency in synchrotron sed .",
    "ic / cmb spectrum is an exact copy of the synchrotron one ( tavecchio et al .",
    "2000 ; celotti et al . 2001 ; georganopoulos et al . 2006 ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the maximum and minimum cutoff frequencies of ic / cmb spectrum .",
    "@xmath11 is the ic / cmb break frequency , i.e. , the peak frequency in ic / cmb sed .",
    "for the 3c 273 jet with equipartition conditions @xmath12 g ( jester et al .",
    "2005 ) , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( georganopoulos et al . 2006 ; meyer & georganopoulos 2014 ) , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the peak ic / cmb and synchrotron luminosities .",
    "the data ( from radio to x - ray ) of knots and large - scale jet are compiled from jester et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2007 ) and uchiyama et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ( see liu & shen ( 2009 ) , for detail ) . for simplicity , we chose @xmath17 and assume @xmath18 is between two data points .",
    "thus , flux formula of the 3c 273 large - scale jet from radio to x - ray has a three - section form .",
    "liu & shen ( 2009 ) performed independent fitting to the two components , here we simultaneously fit to the two components .",
    "we use the fitting method of liu & shen ( 2007 , 2009 ) and liu et al .",
    "( 2013 ) to obtain the best fit .",
    "we arbitrarily divide the data points from radio to x - ray into three groups , the first two groups is synchrotron component , the third group belongs to ic / cmb component .",
    "then , we calculate the corresponding @xmath19 for all the possible combinations , and choose a combination with a minimal @xmath19 among them as the best fit .    the best fitting results are shown in table 1 .",

    ", we can derive @xmath27 hz , @xmath28 and b @xmath29 @xmath30 g .",
    "based on the ic / cmb model fits , the @xmath0 observations may be mainly contributed by the small - scale jet of 3c 273 ( i.e. , the core ) .",
    "if we assume that doppler factor , magnetic field and @xmath18 are similar along the jet , we can impose the synchrotron radio spectrum lower than 10 ghz radio frequency and the ic / cmb @xmath24-ray spectrum of knots in the 3c 273 jet .",
    "the results are shown in fig . 2 ( please note we do nt consider possible absorption effects ) . for the individual knots ,",
    "the synchrotron spectrum of low - energy electrons responsible for the ic / cmb x - ray emission may be different from the extrapolation of the 10 ghz radio spectrum ( i.e. , @xmath4 may be a piecewise function ) , which may be due to more complex acceleration , even multi - populations of electrons .",
