    "diffuse galactic microwave emission in the 10  100 ghz frequency range carries important information on the fundamental properties of the interstellar medium , but it also interferes with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments ( see bouchet et al .  1999 ,",
    "tegmark et al .",
    "2000 , efstathiou 2003 ) .",
    "it used to be thought that there were only three major components of the diffuse microwave galactic foreground : synchrotron emission , free - free radiation from plasma ( thermal bremsstrahlung ) and thermal emission from dust .",
    "however , in the range of frequency from 10 to 100 ghz an anomalous microwave foreground which was difficult to reconcile with the components above was first reported by kogut et al .",
    "( 1996a , 1996b ) .",
    "de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "( 2002 ) gave this emission the nickname `` foreground x '' , reflecting its mysterious nature .",
    "this component is spatially correlated with 100 @xmath2 m thermal emission from dust , but its intensity is much higher than one would expect by extrapolating the thermal dust emission spectrum to the microwave range .",
    "draine & lazarian ( 1998a , b ) proposed that this foreground was electric dipole radiation from ultrasmall spinning dust grains . although such emission from spinning dust had been discussed previously ( see erickson 1957 , ferrara & dettmar 1994 ) , dl98a were the first to include the variety of excitation and damping processes that are relevant for very small grains .",
    "as time went on alternative models for the enigmatic foreground have appeared to be inconsistent with observations , while the predictions of the spinning dust model have thus far been confirmed . as a result",
    ", spinning dust is now the principal explanation for the mysterious `` foreground x '' .",
    "although the model in draine & lazarian ( 1998ab ) provided quantitative predictions consistent with observational data , the current state of precision measurement of the foregrounds calls for refinement of the model , using a better description of the complex grain dynamics and modifying some of the original assumptions .",
    "recent studies showed that the correspondence of the dl98 model to observations can be improved by adjusting the parameters of the model .",
    "for instance , dobler et al .  (",
    "2009 ) used the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) 5 year data to show that a broad bump with frequency at @xmath1 40ghz correlated with h@xmath3 , a tracer of the warm ionized medium ( wim ) .",
    "they showed that this bump is consistent with predictions from a dl98 model modified so that grains have a characteristic dipole moment of @xmath4 d at grain size 1 nm , and the gas number density of the wim is @xmath5 ( cf .",
    "@xmath6 in the dl98 model ) .    on the theoretical front , ali - hamound et al .",
    "( 2009 ) improved the accuracy of predictions of the model of emission from spinning dust using the fokker - planck equation for the angular velocity @xmath7 .",
    "the authors quantified the deviations of the grain angular velocity distribution function from the maxwellian approximation that had been used by dl98b for the sake of simplicity . with the other assumptions being identical to dl98b , their findings are not much different from dl98b s predictions .",
    "however , both the dl98 model and the refined model by ali - hamoud et al .",
    "( 2009 ) disregarded the non - sphericity of grains and the anisotropy in the damping and excitation processes .",
    "obviously , this assumption is inexact for non - spherical grains or when there exists any anisotropy in the damping and excitation processes .",
    "this present paper is intended to go deeper into studies of grain dynamics for a disk - like grain geometry , relaxing more of the simplifying assumptions in the original dl98b treatment .",
    "the main thrust of our present work is to provide a better description of several physical processes which have not been addressed in their complexity either in dl98b or the papers that followed . in particular : ( i ) the effects on electric dipole emission arising from the wobbling of the axis of major inertia of the _ disk - like _ grain around the angular momentum due to internal relaxation and the anisotropy of grain rotational damping and excitation ( not yet been treated in the literature , so far as we are aware ) ; and ( ii ) transient spin - up of very small grains due to single - ion collisions .",
    "first of all , the former process , i.e. , imperfect internal alignment in the non - spherical grain , can alter the frequency at which the electric dipole emits . in the dl98 model ,",
    "the emission frequency is identical to the angular frequency @xmath8 .",
    "however , if the dipole moment is fixed in the grain body , then the complex motion of the grain axes around the angular momentum @xmath9 will result in emission at frequencies different from its angular frequency .",
    "in addition , imperfect alignment is essential for many astrophysical processes , e.g. , for grain alignment ( see lazarian 2007 and lazarian & hoang 2009 for recent reviews ) . in our quest to understand the rotational dynamics of grains which do not rotate about their axis of major inertia we capitalize on improved understanding of internal randomization arising from thermal fluctuations within the grain ( lazarian 1994 , lazarian & roberge 1997 , weingartner 2009 , hoang & lazarian 2009 ) .",
    "disalignment of the grain s principal axis from the direction of the angular momentum @xmath9 will cause the angular velocity to increase , leading to increased electric dipole emission at high frequency .",
    "our paper provides a quantitative description of the effect on the spinning dust emissivity .    the latter process ",
    "collisions with ions  is important for small grains where the angular momentum of an impinging ion can be larger than the pre - collision grain angular momentum , resulting in a rotational excitation spike . in dl98b",
    "it was noted that the effect is expected to increase the spinning dust emissivity , but no quantitative description was given .",
    "while the treatment of high impulse ion collisions is easily performed within our langevin code , the treatment of grain wobbling for non - spherical grains requires a careful and somewhat tedious modification of our treatment of the angular momentum diffusion and damping in the dl98 model .",
    "in particular , we have to consider separately parallel and perpendicular contributions to grain damping and excitation .",
    "in addition , we provide an improved treatment of infrared emission from spinning dust grains .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in  2 , we present elements of the dl98 model and our modifications to that model . in ",
    "3 we provide detailed calculations for rotational damping and excitations arising from plasma - grain interactions and electric dipole emission for the disk - like grain geometry .",
    "refined calculations for the effects of infrared emission are presented in  4 and 5 . in  6 , we study the effect of the grain precession on the electric dipole emission spectrum and identify its frequency modes . in",
    " 7 and 8 we present our numerical techniques for finding the distribution functions of grain angular velocity and electric dipole emission , and benchmark calculations . in  9 , we present our results for emissivities from spinning dust for various idealized environments , and clarify the role of grain shape and differential rotational damping and excitation processes to the increase of peak emissivity and frequency .",
    "discussion and summary are presented in  10 and 11 , respectively .",
    "here we present the grain model and our notation .",
    "dl98 pointed out that the abundant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) particles required to explain the observed infrared emission provide a population of particles that must be spinning and emitting electric dipole radiation in rotational transitions .",

    "the electric dipole moment @xmath2 of a grain arises from the intrinsic electric dipole moment associated with asymmetric molecules or substructures , and from the asymmetric distribution of any excess charge present .",
    "the latter is shown to be less important .",

    ", the distribution of grain charge @xmath21 for a given grain size can be obtained by solving the ionization equilibrium equations ( see draine & sutin 1987 , weingartner & draine 2001b ) .    a grain in the gas experiences collisions with atoms and ions , plasma - grain interactions , infrared emission and electric dipole emission .",
    "all these processes result in damping and excitation of grain rotation .",

    "figure [ jnu_freq ] shows that the increase of emissivity and peak frequency for the grain wobbling case is important .",
    "the peak frequency is increased from @xmath333 to @xmath334ghz ( i.e. , by factors of 1.2 to 1.8 ) different environments ( see subplot in figure [ jnu_freq ] ) .",

    "in addition , the enhancement of peak frequency for the case without internal relaxation is smaller than that for fast internal relaxation .",
    "that can be explained by the fact that some emissivity from its peak can be transferred to higher frequency , resulting more extended spectra present in the case without internal relaxation ( dot line in figure [ jnu_freq ] ) .",

    "we run the le simulations for the grain wobbling taking into account the impulses for grain size from @xmath37 to @xmath293 for these environments .",
    "we consider both the fast internal relaxation and without internal relaxation .",
    "the resultant emissivity is compared with that from the case without impulses in figure [ jnu_imp ] for the wnm and wim .",
    "it can be seen that the ionic impulses broaden efficiently the emission spectra to the higher frequency , but they change slightly the peak frequency . for the wim ,",
    "the net effect of impulses and grain wobbling enhances the peak emissivity by a factor of @xmath337 , and the peak frequency is increased from @xmath321 to @xmath338 ghz .",
    "the corresponding increase in peak emissivity for the wnm is a factor of @xmath339 , and the peak frequency is increased from @xmath340 to @xmath341 ghz . by subtracting the effect of grain wobbling ,",
    "we see that the impulses can increase the peak emissivity by @xmath342 and @xmath343 for the wim and wnm , respectively , but they increase slightly the peak frequency ( see figures [ jnu_freq ] and [ jnu_imp ] ) .    for the cnm , the lower panel of figure [ fj_cnm ] shows that the effect of impulses on the total emissivity is weaker than for the wim and wnm .",
    "the reasons for that are as follows .",
    "first , although the focusing effect is important for the grain in the negatively charged state , resulting in rotational impulses at high frequency ( see the dot line in the upper panel of figure [ fj_cnm ] ) , the probability of the grain in this negative charge state is relatively small .",
    "second , since the effective range of impulses of the cnm is much narrower than that for the wim and wnm ( see the upper panel of figure [ rate ] ) , its emissivity , that is obtained by integrating over the entire grain size distribution , is obviously less affected by impulses compared to the wim and wnm .",
    "we note that for a small grain in the cnm , wnm and wim , during a short interval of several @xmath344 , the grain experiences some rotational spikes due to single - ion collisions as shown in the left lower subplot of figure [ rate ] . the peak frequency and width of the spectrum",
    "are related to the mean square value , @xmath54 , which is averaged over total integration time @xmath229 .",
    "therefore , the overall effect of the transient spin - up is to broaden the emission spectrum and increase the total emissivity as seen in figure [ jnu_imp ] .         with @xmath345 is the normalized distribution function , as a function of @xmath346 where @xmath307 is the grain charge @xmath307 ( upper panel ) and emissivity ( lower panel ) .",
    "gray and blue shaded areas correspond to the transition between fast internal relaxation ( solid line ) and without internal relaxation ( dot line ) for the case without and with impulses , respectively .",
    "the focusing effect for the grain with charge @xmath347 enhances the high - frequency tail ( dot line in upper panel),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]   with @xmath345 is the normalized distribution function , as a function of @xmath346 where @xmath307 is the grain charge @xmath307 ( upper panel ) and emissivity ( lower panel ) .",

    "let us consider a disk - like grain shape and when internal relaxation is important .",
    "to investigate the effect of grain wobbling for both spherical grains ( @xmath348 ) and disk - like grain ( @xmath13 ) , we run le simulations to find @xmath34 and @xmath349 for the case of imperfect internal alignment assuming fast internal relaxation , for grain size from @xmath37 to @xmath38    we consider here the rn and pdr for which electric dipole damping is subdominant .",
    "results are shown in figure [ dnupeak_a ] where solid and dashed lines represent @xmath349 obtained using the dl98 model and le simulations , respectively .",
    "the ratio of @xmath349 to that of dl98 model is depicted in the upper right subplot .",
    "is maxwellian , therefore @xmath350 the excitation anisotropy ratio @xmath351 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : eta ] ) is shown in the lower left subplot .",
    "first of all , for the pdr , the peak frequency from le simulations is slightly higher than that from the dl98 model for spherical grains ( @xmath352 cm ) .",
    "for very small disk - like grains ( @xmath353 cm ) , the peak frequency is increased by a mean factor of @xmath327 . for the rn ,",
    "one interesting feature is that the peak frequency from le is much larger that that from the dl98 model for spherical grains(cf . to the pdr ) .",
    "we attribute the increase to the anisotropy in the grain rotational damping and excitation due to the infrared emission , which is the most important process of grain excitation for the rn . for spherical grains in the range from @xmath91 to @xmath354 cm ,",
    "@xmath355 increase from @xmath356 to @xmath357 for the pdr , and from @xmath328 to @xmath358 for the rn ( see subplots in the lower left corner of figure [ dnupeak_a ] ) .",
    "hence , the higher anisotropy in the rn corresponds to the higher increase of peak frequency compared to the pdr case .    to see clearly the dependence of the increase in @xmath349 in the grain wobbling case , we plot @xmath359 as a function of @xmath355 for the pdr in figure [ dnupeak_eta ]",
    ". the solid line corresponds to = [ nupeakmax ] where diamonds show @xmath349 from the le simulations .",

    "@xmath349 from the le simulations is similar to that from equation ( [ nupeakmax ] ) , and some difference appears when @xmath355 increases ( see figure [ dnupeak_a ] ) .",
    "this may stem from two reasons .",
    "first , the angular velocity distribution function @xmath34 for @xmath360 is maxwellian , but it differs from the maxwellian distribution when @xmath355 increases .",
    "second , the assumption that @xmath361 are independent in deriving equation ( [ nupeakmax ] ) is not valid because they have complex motion in the inertial coordinate system .    in other words ,",
    "the anisotropy due to non - sphericity of grain shapes _ and _ the anisotropy in the grain rotational damping and excitation both act to increase the peak frequency of the emission .    , and from the dl98 model @xmath362 , respectively .",
    "the ratio @xmath359 versus @xmath10 is shown in the upper corner subplot , and the anisotropy @xmath363 is shown in the left lower corner.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ] , and from the dl98 model @xmath362 , respectively .",

[ nupeakmax ] ) for the pdr .",
    "the gap between @xmath364 and @xmath328 arises from the change in the grain geometry from sphere to disklike.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    finally , we note that the total emissivity due to spinning dust scales as @xmath365 , thus , the increase of @xmath349 naturally is accompanied by the increase of the peak emissivity as observed in figure [ jnu_freq ] .",
    "the dl98 model was the first proposal to explain the @xmath366 ghz anomalous foreground emission in terms of rotational emission from ultra - small dust particles .",
    "numerous observations ( dobler et al .  2009 and references therein ) have confirmed the dl98 model predictions .    in the dl98 model",
    "the calculations were mostly analytical .",
    "the present study used a different approach , namely , the langevin equation .",
    "we successfully benchmarked our calculations against the fokker - plank calculation in ali - hamoud et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for the perfect alignment case , and then introduced additional effects not included in dl98 .",
    "in particular , our approach allows us to treat discrete high impact impulses arising from single - ion collisions with the grain .",
    "most importantly , it enables us to study the spinning dust emission for the case of imperfect internal alignment with and without fast internal relaxation .    among grain rotational",
    "damping and excitation processes , plasma drag is shown to be important for molecular clouds and cnm . ragot ( 2002 ) considered the interactions of the plasma with spinning dust from the point of view of generation of waves .",
    "we believe that for the case we consider , the dust - plasma interaction is accurately approximated by interaction of the grain with individual , uncorrelated , passing ions .",
    "dl98b noted that the typical rotational quantum number of even a small pah would be @xmath367 , allowing the dynamics to be treated classically .",
    "ysard & verstraete ( 2009 ) formulated the problem quantum - mechanically ; the close correspondence between their results and those of dl98b confirms that a classical treatment is entirely adequate .",
    "can not be less than @xmath368 . ]",
    "while our studies confirm the general validity of the dl98 model of spinning dust emission , they also show ways of making the model predictions more accurate .",
    "for instance , our refined treatment of grain dynamics provides peak emissivity predictions which differ by factors from @xmath369 to @xmath370 from the original ones , depending on the environments .",
    "these differences may be detectable with high precision future observations .",
    "the largest uncertainty within the model is the value of the dipole electric moment .",
    "the distribution of dipole moments adopted in dl98b was only an educated guess .",
    "moreover , this distribution could be affected by interstellar processes and change from one media to another .",
    "for instance , dobler et al .  (",
    "2009 ) showed the anomalous emission in the 5-year wmap data exhibits a bump at @xmath371 ghz .",
    "this peak frequency is larger than the prediction by the original dl98b model but could be explained if a modified distribution of electric dipole moments is adopted ( dobler et al .",
    "2009 ) , but the new effects considered here  misaligned rotation and impulsive excitation by ions may also explain the observed emission spectrum .",
    "dl98b pointed out that for the cnm , wnm and wim the angular momentum transferred in a single ion collision can be larger than the angular momentum of the rotating grain , but neither dl98b or the subsequent paper by ali - hamoud et al .",
    "( 2009 ) treated the impulsive nature of the ion collisions .    in the present paper , we describe ion - grain collisions as poisson - distributed discrete events .",
    "when an ion hits the grain surface , the grain undergoes transient spin - up and then gets damped , mainly by electric dipole damping . due to strong electric dipole damping , small grains spend most of their time rotating subthermally between two rotational spikes due to single - ion collisions .",
    "ionic impulses are shown to be important for grains smaller that @xmath372 , @xmath373 and @xmath374 cm for the wim , wnm and cnm , respectively .",
    "our quantitative simulations show that the impulses extend the high - frequency tail of the emission spectrum but change the peak frequency only slightly .",
    "they can enhance the peak emissivity by @xmath375 and @xmath343 for the wim and wnm , respectively .",
    "the dl98b model assumed perfect alignment of the grain axis of maximal moment of inertia with the instantaneous angular momentum .",
    "this assumption is valid only for strong internal relaxation _ and _ suprathermal ( much faster than thermal ) rotation of grains ( lazarian 1994 ) .",
    "the tiny grains we deal with rotate thermally or subthermally .",
    "for such a rotation , the grain axes are _ not _ coupled with the angular momentum . due to imperfect internal alignment ( i.e. , grain wobbling ) ,",
    "the anisotropy arising from grain shape , and differential damping and excitation ( e.g. due to infrared emission and plasma drag ) obviously affect the grain mean rotation rate and therefore the emissivity . increased grain anisotropy , as measured by the anisotropy ratio @xmath355 ( eq .  [ eq : eta ] )",
    "produces an increase in the peak frequency and emissivity .",
    "as we do not know the rates for internal relaxation in microscopic molecular size grains , we considered two cases : very rapid internal relaxation , and very slow internal relaxation . using the langevin equation , we showed that for the former case , the peak emissivity of spinning dust increases by a factor of @xmath369 , and the peak frequency of the spectrum increases by factors from 1.4 to 1.8 , depending on the environment .",
    "grain wobbling has a larger effect in broadening the emission spectrum when the internal relaxation is slow .",
    "especially , for the rn when the anisotropy of damping and excitation from infrared emission is very high , the peak emissivity can be increased by a factor of @xmath370 and peak frequency is increased by a factor of @xmath376 .    for the wim",
    ", the joint effect of grain wobbling and impulses due to single - ion collisions causes the peak frequency to shift from @xmath377 to @xmath338 ghz .",
    "it is interesting to note that the new predicted peak frequency is close to the bump with the anomalous emission found in the wmap five year data ( dobler et al .",
    "2009 ) . in their paper",
    ", using the dl98b model , they explained the observed spectrum with a modified model of spinning dust in which the grains have broader distribution of electric dipole moments .",
    "they also varied the number density of the wim to produce spectra with higher peak frequency .",
    "these modifications do not seem to be necessary with our improved treatment of grain dynamics .",
    "the present paper provides a refinement of the dl98 model of spinning dust emission .",
    "our principal results are outlined below :    \\1 .",
    "we derived the rotational damping and excitation coefficients arising from plasma drag , infrared emission , gas drag and the electric dipole damping for small disk - like grains with imperfect internal alignment .",
    "a nonspherical grain precessing around its angular momentum @xmath9 radiates primarily at two frequency modes .",
    "the lower frequency is dominant and is not the same as the rotational frequency @xmath8 .",
    "\\3 . using the langevin equation , we calculated the emissivity of grains with disaligned rotation , both with and without fast internal relaxation . for fast internal relaxation , allowing for disaligned rotation , the peak emissivity of spinning dust",
    "is increased by a factor @xmath1 2 for the cnm , wnm , wim and pdr ; and by a factor of @xmath1 4 for the rn , compared to those from the fp equation method .",
    "fast internal relaxation also shifts the emission spectra to higher frequencies factors of 1.4 to 2 for these environments .",
    "slow internal relaxation broadens the emission spectrum and reduces the enhancement in the peak emissivity .",
    "the increase of peak emissivity and frequency of spinning dust in the grain wobbling case compared to those from the dl98 model has two sources : the anisotropy of the moment of inertia tensor , and the anisotropy in the rotational damping and excitation processes ( e.g. infrared emission and plasma drag ) .",
    "higher anisotropy results in higher enhancement of peak frequency and emissivity .",
    "we devised a method to include the high - impact ion collisions within our statistical treatment of grain rotation .",
    "we found that for the cnm , wnm and wim , single - ion impulses result in strong broadening of the emission spectrum to higher frequency and increases the emissivity of spinning dust .",
    "impulsive excitation is most efficient for the wim , but it is not important for the rn and pdr . in all idealized environments ,",
    "the transient spin - up is subdominant compared to grain wobbling in terms of enhancement of emissivity , but it is dominant in spectrum broadening for the cnm , wnm and wim .    \\6 . for the wim ,",
    "the net effect of grain wobbling and transient spin - up from single - ion collision increases the peak emissivity by a factor @xmath378 , and the peak frequency increases from @xmath321 to @xmath338 ghz .",

    "<S> first , we consider a _ disk - like _ grain rotating with angular velocity at an arbitrary angle with respect to the grain symmetry axis ( i.e. , grain wobbling ) and derive the rotational damping and excitation coefficients arising from infrared emission , plasma - grain interactions and electric dipole emission . </S>",

    "<S> our results show that for fast internal relaxation , the peak emissivity of spinning dust , compared to earlier studies , increases by a factor of @xmath0 2 for the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) , the warm ionized medium ( wim ) , the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) and the photodissociation region ( pdr ) , and by a factor @xmath1 4 for reflection nebulae ( rn ) . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency at the emission peak also increases by factors @xmath11.4 to @xmath12 for these media . without internal relaxation , </S>",
    "<S> the increase of emissivity is comparable , but the emission spectrum is more extended to higher frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the increased emission results from the non - sphericity of grain shape and from the anisotropy in damping and excitation along directions parallel and perpendicular to the grain symmetry axis . </S>",
    "<S> second , we provide a detailed numerical study including transient spin - up of grains by single - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the range of grain size in which single - ion collisions are important is identified . </S>",
    "<S> the impulses broaden the emission spectrum and increase the peak emissivity for the cnm , wnm and wim , although the increases are not as large as those due to the grain wobbling . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we present an improved treatment of rotational excitation and damping by infrared emission . </S>"
