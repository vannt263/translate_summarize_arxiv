    "+ after confirming the room - temperature crystal structure to be @xmath50 and the magnetic structure as @xmath5 ( @xmath7 ) , we now discuss the low temperature diffraction data . in fig  [ fig_npd ] , an expanded view of the reflections in the 2@xmath67-range 3135@xmath35",

    "the nuclear structure was refined in @xmath50 and the magnetic structure in @xmath5 ( @xmath7 ) similar to the case of 300  k - data .",

    "the mixed - domains of ( @xmath31 + @xmath5 ) were found to exist down till @xmath46 at 26  k. fig  [ fig_mag ] shows that `` loop - like '' anomalies are present in the @xmath38 which correspond to the spin - reorientation transition at @xmath46 .",
    "in fact , from the panel ( c ) of fig  [ fig_mag ] it can be seen that the irreversibility in zfc and fc curves commences at 36  k itself .",
    "finally at 10  k , the @xmath5 representation observed at 300  k re - emerges .",
    "it was observed that the inclusion of tb moments in the refinement at 10  k and 5  k did not lead to any appreciable values of refined magnetic moment on the tb site . at 2  k ,",
    "the magnetic structure remains in the @xmath5 representation however , tb develops a magnetic moment value of 0.6(2 )  @xmath11f.u . indicating that tb is magnetically ordered at this temperature .",
    "the irreversibility in @xmath71 suggesting magnetic ordering in the rare earth sublattice occurs @xmath45 5  k. however , attempts to refine the 5  k - data assuming magnetic contribution from tb did not yield better agreement factors .",
    "hence magnetic contributions from mn / fe were only considered .",
    "the refinement of the magnetic structure of tb was performed in @xmath12 representation following the symmetry analysis@xcite . in fig  [ fig_npd_refine ] ( a)(e ) , the refined diffraction patterns of tbfe@xmath4mn@xmath4o@xmath0 at 200 , 50 , 26 , 10  k and 2  k are shown .",

    "a schematic of the magnetic structures @xmath31 and @xmath5 are shown in fig  [ fig_magstr ] . in the case of @xmath5 , the @xmath12 type ordering of tb ions are also depicted ( tb moments are shown in blue ) .",
    "next , we make an attempt to quantify the volume fraction of the two magnetic domains @xmath31 and @xmath5 . for this calculation",
    "we assume that the total fe / mn ordered moment at a particular temperature is equal for both @xmath31 and @xmath5 domains . with this assumption and by setting the scale factors of both @xmath31 and @xmath5 domains equal to that of the nuclear phase",
    ", the ratio of refined ordered moments of @xmath31 and @xmath5 should give the percentage of each domains .",
    "the result of this calculation is presented as fig  [ fig_domains ] . as clear from the figure , mixed domain structure is present in the wide temperature range of 250  k to 26  k. outside this temperature window , the major magnetic phase is that of @xmath5 .",
    "our investigation of the magnetic structure of tbfe@xmath4mn@xmath4o@xmath0 shows that the predominant structures are @xmath5 and @xmath31 however , a competition between these two magnetic phases is evident from the presence of a mixed - domains in certain temperature range . at 295  k",
    ", the high temperature paramagnetic phase transforms to the magnetic structure @xmath5 ( @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) .",

    "k a mixed - domains of ( @xmath31 + @xmath5 ) is observed which remains down till 26  k. a precise phase space study to determine the boundaries of the mixed phase would demand many more temperature points , but such a detailed study was outside the design and scope of our present experiments .    as evidenced by the @xmath38 curve ( fig  [ fig_mag ] ( a ) ) , the @xmath46 is associated with a clear bifurcation of zfc and fc forming a `` loop - like '' region between 18  k and 36  k. we deduce that the mixed - domains extend over this temperature window .",
    "further at 10  k , the @xmath5 structure reemerges and remains till 2  k. in the temperature range 2 - 10  k , the magnetic representation @xmath31 leads to a high @xmath72 60 .",
    "it did not adequately account for the magnetic peaks and hence , @xmath5 ( @xmath72 3.5 ) was chosen as the solution .",
    "note that in both @xmath31 and @xmath5 , fe / mn are constrained to have magnetic moments in @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 whereas the @xmath15-moment is constrained to the @xmath56-direction .",
    "we found that in whole temperature range in @xmath31 setting the fe / mn magnetic moments had negligible @xmath54 and @xmath56 components ( practically zero ) and aligned along y - axis ( fig .",

    ", it is found that in the low temperature region significant diffuse scattered intensity is present arising from the short - range magnetic order of tb .",
    "supporting this feature is the fact that no enhancement on quality of the fit was obtained in refining the 5  k or 10  k diffraction data by introducing a magnetic moment for tb . only at 2  k",
    "does tb begin to order as @xmath12 as evident by the development of 0.6(2 )  @xmath76 for tb moment .",
    "a notable difference of the magnetic structure of fe / mn in tbfe@xmath4mn@xmath4o@xmath0 compared to that of the parent compound tbfeo@xmath0 is that the latter compound transforms to @xmath59 ( @xmath18 ) structure at the spin - reorientation transition . in both the cases ,",
    "the high temperature structure pertaining to fe / mn is @xmath5 . in tbfeo@xmath0 ,",
    "the tb moment undergoes two types of ordering below 10  k in to @xmath20 and to @xmath21 whereas in tbfe@xmath4mn@xmath4o@xmath0 , tb develops no significant magnetic moment until 2  k where it orders @xmath12 .",
    "in conclusion , the mn - doped orthoferrite compound tbfe@xmath4mn@xmath4o@xmath0 orders antiferromagnetically at @xmath77 300  k and undergoes spin - reorientation transition at @xmath46 26  k. further , at 2  k the rare earth tb is found to be magnetically ordered , however , the exact ordering temperature is no confirmed through our study .",
