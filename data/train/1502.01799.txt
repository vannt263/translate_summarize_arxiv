    "the problem addressed here is fundamental and not new to the cosmic ray ( cr ) transport studies .",
    "it can be formulated very plainly : how to describe cr transport by only their isotropic component , after the anisotropic one has decayed by scattering on magnetic irregularities ?",
    "suppose the angular distribution of crs is given by the function @xmath0 obeying an equation from which the rapid gyro - phase rotation is already removed ( drift approximation , e.g. , @xcite )    @xmath1    here @xmath2 is the local coordinate along the ambient magnetic field , @xmath3 is the cosine of the particle pitch angle , and @xmath4 is the pitch angle diffusion coefficient .",
    "now , we make the next step in simplifying the transport description and seek an equation for the pitch - angle averaged distribution    @xmath5 the basic solution to this problem has been known for at least half a century ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . to the leading order in @xmath6 ( assuming the characteristic scale and time of the problem being longer than particle mean free path and collision time ) it can be obtained straightforwardly by averaging eq.([eq : pascatintro ] )    @xmath7 and substituting @xmath8 from eq.([eq : pascatintro ] ) as :    @xmath9    thus , the following diffusion equation results for @xmath10 :    @xmath11    a questionable point of course is neglecting @xmath12 in favor for @xmath13 in eq.([eq : dfdmuintro ] ) . it is somewhat justified by the small parameter @xmath14 in the _ final result _ , given by eq.([eq : difintro ] ) , making @xmath12 hopefully small . on the other hand",
    "this is true for @xmath15 but not necessarily for @xmath12 , since the latter may contain also the rapidly decaying anisotropic part @xmath16 of the initial cr distribution . for @xmath17 , however , @xmath18 must die out and neglecting @xmath12 appears plausible for the _ long - term _ cr transport . at the same time , @xmath15 is large when @xmath10 is very narrow in @xmath2 initially , such as in the fundamental solution . in the sequel",
    ", these aspects of the cr propagation will be a key for choosing an appropriate asymptotic reduction method .",
    "however convincing the justification , the cr diffusion model encounters the problem of a superluminal , or simply `` too - fast '' particle propagation .",
    "although rather common for diffusive models , the problem is largely ignorable as long as the number of such particles remains small .",
    "there are cases , however , such as the propagation of ultra high - energy cosmic rays , where this problem must be addressed @xcite .",
    "various attempts , starting as early as in 60s , e.g. , @xcite , have been made to devise a better transport equation for crs .",
    "unfortunately , in our view , they lack mathematical rigor and clarity and sometimes lead to inconsistent results .    in the most recent telegraph model , due to @xcite , a higher order in @xmath19 term",
    "was included by retaining @xmath12 , dropped in the simplest derivation above .",
    "this strategy gave rise to an additional @xmath20 -term in the `` master '' equation .",
    "this additional term transforms eq.([eq : difintro ] ) into a `` telegraph '' equation :    @xmath21    with    @xmath22^{2}\\right\\rangle \\middle/\\left\\langle \\frac{1-\\mu^{2}}{\\mathcal{d}}\\right\\rangle \\right.,\\;\\;\\ ; l^{-1}=-b^{-1}\\partial b/\\partial z\\label{eq : kappatau}\\ ] ]    for the sake of comparison with earlier telegraph equation results that will be made in sec.[sec : comparison ] , we have added here the magnetic focusing effect ( the last term on the r.h.s . with @xmath23@xmath24 being the magnetic field ) , not included initially in eq.([eq : pascatintro ] ) .",
    "eq.([eq : telegreqintro ] ) is just a linear equation that can be solved immediately .",
    "the fundamental solution to eq.([eq : telegreqintro ] ) that starts off from a @xmath25 distribution , instantaneously released at @xmath26 , is as follows ( e.g. , @xcite , @xmath27 , for simplicity )    @xmath28\\right\\ } \\label{eq : telintrosol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath29 denote the modified bessel functions and @xmath30 - the heaviside unit function .",
    "one promising aspect of the telegraph equation is that it allows for a ballistic mode of cr propagation when the initial conditions empower the higher - order derivative terms to dominate ( at least in early phase of evolution ) .",
    "if , in addition , @xmath31 has a proper value , the bulk speed of crs may also be realistic .",
    "for example , this speed was derived in @xcite to be @xmath32 , which has also been used earlier by @xcite .",
    "this is just the rms velocity projection of an isotropic , one - sided cr distribution on @xmath2-axis , which appears to resolve the issue with the superluminal propagation .",
    "what is worrisome here is that this bulk speed essentially requires a _",
    "one - sided _ `` isotropic '' cr distribution which , of course , is highly anisotropic overall , contrary to the basic assumption of most treatments .",
    "so , we need to start with isotropic initial distribution but , taking it narrow and symmetric in @xmath2 ( say gaussian ) , the higher - order derivative terms will , again , dominate in eq.([eq : telegreqintro ] ) and the single cr pulse will split into two , propagating in opposite directions at the speeds @xmath33 ( as @xmath34 at @xmath26 , according to eq.[[eq : pascatintro ] ] ) . neglecting @xmath15 ( which is justified for @xmath10 sufficiently narrow in @xmath2 ) , the solution is simply @xmath35 , where @xmath36@xmath37 .",
    "this result casts doubts on whether the telegraph term can be dominant under the assumption of frequent cr scattering ( asymptotic expansion in small @xmath6 ) , as the initially sharp profile does not spread .",
    "bringing @xmath15 back into the equation will only damp but not spread the profile , as clearly seen from the solution given in eq.([eq : telintrosol ] ) , where @xmath38 .",
    "besides , the bulk cr speed @xmath39 for an isotropic scattering @xmath40 , although implicitly confirmed in the recent derivation of the telegraph equation for an arbitrary @xmath41 by @xcite , is not universally accepted . @xcite and @xcite , using simplified forms of @xmath42 , advocate the value @xmath43 for the propagation speed .    the last result is consistent with our calculations below , but with strong reservations regarding the telegraph equation set out later in the paper .",
    "here we merely note that the solution of telegraph equation specifically considered by @xcite , which does not have the property of splitting the initially narrow pulse into two , does not conserve the total cr number @xmath44 .",
    "it starts off from @xmath45 which is unphysical , as the equation has no source on its r.h.s . to conserve @xmath46 , two @xmath47 pulses in eq.([eq : telintrosol ] )",
    "are necessary .",
    "those have been added to the treatment by @xcite , but the @xmath47 pulses have not been shown on their plots , for obvious reason .",
    "so , the comparison of this solution with the solution of the original scattering problem is rather misleading .",
    "the disagreement on the propagation speed @xmath48 is also critical as the solution in eq.([eq : telintrosol ] ) is cut off at a point @xmath2 moving with this speed . for @xmath49",
    "the profile is close to a gaussian ( for @xmath50 , where @xmath31 is the scattering time ) , so small variations in the speed can produce significant variations in the solution .",
    "we will also return to this later .",
    "another disadvantage of the telegraph equation ( [ eq : telegreqintro ] ) is that it is no longer an evolution equation and requires the time derivative @xmath51 as an initial condition .",
    "although this can be inferred from the angular distribution at @xmath26 using eq.([eq : pascatintro ] ) , the `` telegraph '' description of cr transport is not self - contained .",
    "we show below that the @xmath31-term in eq.([eq : telegreqintro ] ) is subdominant in an asymptotic series for @xmath17 , thus representing transients in the cr transport . strictly speaking",
    ", it should be omitted in the asymptotic transport description along with the small hyper - diffusion term @xmath52 , particularly if the term @xmath53 does not vanish .",
    "the latter was not included in eq.([eq : telegreqintro ] ) , as it was obtained by applying insufficient direct iteration to eq.([eq : pascatintro ] ) in @xcite , or assuming symmetric scattering , @xmath54 , when it indeed vanishes .",
    "this symmetry restriction was relaxed in @xcite .",
    "the reasons why we undertake the derivation of master equation to a higher ( fourth ) order of approximation for an arbitrary @xmath41 are several .",
    "first , it is necessary to clarify the role of the telegraph term entertained in the literature as an allegedly viable alternative to the standard diffusion model .",
    "second , it is important to obtain the transport coefficients valid for arbitrary @xmath41 , that is for an arbitrary spectrum of magnetic fluctuations . as we will show , the previous such derivation due to @xcite , does not include the third order term , while including only one fourth order term , while there are more such terms ( see eq.[[eq : master4 ] ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the diffusion equation ( [ eq : difintro ] ) supplemented by a convective term @xmath55 for the case of the bulk fluid ( scattering center ) motion with velocity @xmath56 , has long been and remains the main tool for diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) models .",
    "an accurate assessment of the next non - vanishing term , not included in eq.([eq : difintro ] ) , is thus utterly important for the dsa , particularly as claims are being made about the necessity to include the telegraph term in the cr transport . in most dsa applications ,",
    "it is crucial to allow not only for an arbitrary fluctuation spectrum @xmath4 but for its dependence upon @xmath10 as well .",
    "this dependence directly affects the particle spectrum and acceleration time .",
    "we will discuss these aspects briefly in sec.[sec : summary - and - conclusions ] .    in the next section ,",
    "the basic transport equation with magnetic focusing is introduced and the shortcomings of a reduction scheme based on direct iterations are demonstrated .",
    "the appropriate asymptotic method is elaborated in sec.[sec : chapman - enskog - expansion ] .",
    "apart from what we already discussed regarding the telegraph equation , the objective of sec.[sec : chapman - enskog - expansion ] is to create a framework suitable also for nonlinear ( e.g. , @xcite ) and quasi - linear @xcite versions of cr transport which are important for both the dsa and for the subsequent escape of the accelerated cr . in these settings ,",
    "the cr pressure is high enough to strongly modify at least the pitch - angle diffusion coefficient @xmath4 and possibly the shock structure itself @xcite . in secs.[sec : comparison ] and [ sec : relation - between - telegraph ] the implications of our results for the telegraph model and for the long - time cr propagation are discussed , while sec.[sec : summary - and - conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "energetic particles ( e.g. , crs ) in a magnetic field , slowly varying on the particle gyro - scale , are transported according to the following gyro - phase averaged equation , e.g. @xcite    @xmath57    here @xmath58 and @xmath3 are the particle velocity and pitch angle , @xmath2 points in the local field direction , @xmath59 is the magnetic field inverse scale and @xmath60 is the pitch angle scattering rate , while @xmath61 depends on the spectrum of magnetic fluctuations .",
    "as the fastest transport is assumed to be in @xmath3 , we introduce the following small parameter    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the particle mean free path and @xmath64 is a characteristic scale that should be chosen depending on the problem considered .",
    "one option is the scale of @xmath65 , in which case @xmath66 . if the cr source is present on the r.h.s . of eq.[[eq :",
    "boltzmann ] ] ) , its scale can be taken as @xmath64 .",
    "finally , @xmath64 can be the scale of an initial cr distribution . strictly speaking , the shortest of these scales",
    "should be taken as @xmath64 .",
    "the problem with the initial cr distribution is that in the most interesting case of the fundamental solution this scale is zero .",
    "therefore , over the initial period of cr spreading , before the actual cr scale @xmath67 exceeds the m.f.p .",
    "@xmath63 , direct asymptotic expansions in small @xmath68 remain inaccurate .",
    "the goal here is to choose the _ least inaccurate _ out of all possible expansion schemes . at a minimum",
    ", it should be the one that does not introduce additional singularities , apart from the initial delta function @xmath25 , that must spread out under the particle recession and collisions . therefore , while taking @xmath69 in eq.([eq : epsilondef ] ) , and assuming @xmath70 , caution will be exercised during the initial phase of the cr relaxation when the terms with higher spatial and time derivatives are large , even if they contain small factors @xmath71 . by measuring time in @xmath72 , @xmath2 in @xmath64 , and simply replacing @xmath73",
    ", the above equation transforms as follows    @xmath74    a suitable scheme for asymptotic reduction of the above equation using @xmath75 is due to chapman and enskog , suggested in development of the earlier ideas by hilbert ( a good discussion of the history of this method with mathematical details is given by @xcite ) .",
    "originally , it was applied to boltzmann equation in a strongly collisional regime .",
    "similar approaches have been used in plasma physics , e.g. , in regards to the hydrodynamic description of collisional magnetized plasmas @xcite and the problem of run - away electrons @xcite .",
    "regardless of the asymptotic scheme , eq.([eq : boltzmannrescaled ] ) suggests to seek @xmath76 as a series in @xmath68    @xmath77    where    @xmath78    so that @xmath79 .",
    "the equation for @xmath10 , which is the main ( `` master '' ) equation of the method , takes the following form    @xmath80    we see from this equation that , similarly to the case of lorentz s gas in an electric field @xcite , @xmath10 depends on the `` slow time '' @xmath81 rather than on @xmath82 .",
    "indeed , the two problems are similar in that they describe diffusive expansion of particles in phase space .",
    "the expansion occurs in @xmath2-direction for the cr diffusion problem and in energy for runaway electrons .",
    "the expansion is driven by a rapid isotropization in pitch angle plus the convection in @xmath2- direction , or acceleration in the electric field direction , for the cr transport and electron runaway , respectively .",
    "the slow dependence of @xmath10 on time in eq.([eq : master ] ) may suggest to attribute the time derivative term in eq.([eq : boltzmannrescaled ] ) to a higher order approximation ( thus moving it to the r.h.s . ) .",
    "such ordering has been employed by @xcite and the term @xmath83 has been produced in eq.([eq : master ] ) .",
    "obviously , a continuation of this process would result in progressively higher time derivatives of @xmath10 , corresponding to shorter and shorter times in the initial relaxation .",
    "these transient phenomena will be removed using the chapman - enskog asymptotic reduction scheme in the next section .",
    "unlike @xmath10 , @xmath18 in eq.([eq : fasser ] ) does depend on @xmath82 as on a `` fast '' time .",
    "therefore , it is illegitimate to attribute the first term on the l.h.s of eq.([eq : boltzmannrescaled ] ) to any order of approximation different from that of the second term , notwithstanding its fast decay for @xmath84 .",
    "thus , using eqs.([eq : boltzmannrescaled]-[eq : fasser ] ) we must apply the following ordering    @xmath85    the above expansion scheme is sufficient to recover the leading order of @xmath10 evolution from eq.([eq : master ] ) by substituting there @xmath86 , obtained from the last equation for @xmath84",
    ". however , this scheme is not suitable for determining @xmath87 for @xmath88 to submit to eq.([eq : master ] ) . indeed , as it may be seen from eq.([eq :",
    "initordering ] ) , the solubility condition for @xmath89 at @xmath90 is @xmath91 .",
    "this is clearly too strong a restriction .",
    "the reason for this inconsistency of the direct asymptotic expansion is that @xmath10 depends on time much slower than @xmath92 so a slow time @xmath81 needs to be taken into consideration .",
    "the chapman - enskog method has been developed for such cases , and we will make use of it in the next section .",
    "as we have seen , the asymptotic reduction of the original cr propagation problem , given by eq.([eq : boltzmannrescaled ] ) , to its isotropic part can not proceed to higher orders of approximation using a simple asymptotic series in eq.([eq : fasser ] ) and requires a multi - time asymptotic expansion . in chapman - enskog method the operator @xmath93",
    "is expanded instead .",
    "its purpose is to avoid unwanted higher time derivatives to appear in higher orders of approximation .",
    "this is very similar to , e.g. , a secular growth in perturbed oscillations of dynamical systems . to eliminate the secular terms , one seeks to alter ( also expand in small parameter ) the frequency of the zero order motion , which is similar to the @xmath93 expansion .",
    "one example of such approach may be found in a derivation of hydrodynamic equations for strongly collisional but magnetized plasmas , starting from boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "the classical monograph by @xcite ( ch.viii ) gives another example of a subdivision of @xmath93 operator for solving the transport problem in a non - uniform gas - mixture .",
    "expanding @xmath93 operators eliminates secular terms , such as the telegraph term .",
    "perhaps more customary today and equivalently is to introduce a hierarchy of formally independent time variables ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath94 , so that    @xmath95    instead of eq.([eq : initordering ] ) , from eq.([eq : boltzmannrescaled ] ) we have    @xmath96\\left(t_{0},\\dots , t_{n};\\mu , z\\right)\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the conditions @xmath97 are implied .",

    "we can proceed to higher orders of approximation _ ad infinitum _ since terms containing @xmath134 can be expressed through @xmath135 . according to eqs.([eq : df0dt0]-[eq : df0dt1 ] ) , of interest is the evolution of @xmath10 on the time scales @xmath136 or @xmath137 so , as we already mentioned , the contributions of @xmath138 to all the solubility conditions , similar to those given by eqs.([eq : df0dt2]-[eq : df0dt4 ] ) , have to be dropped ( as they become exponentially small ) and only @xmath139- contributions should be retained .",

    "higher order terms can be calculated at the expense of a more involved algebra , but we argue below that such calculations would not change the results significantly .",
    "in contrast to the telegraph equation given by eqs.([eq : telegreqintro]-[eq : kappatau ] ) , that has been derived by @xcite using direct iteration of eq.([eq : boltzmann ] ) with no explicit ordering of the emerging terms , eq.([eq : master4 ] ) is derived to the @xmath145- order of approximation with an @xmath148 factor labeling each term .",
    "yet , it has no second order time derivative which is inconsistent with eq.([eq : telegreqintro ] ) .",
    "below we demonstrate that eq.([eq : master4 ] ) can still be converted to the telegraph form , however , with additional terms absent from eq.([eq : telegreqintro]-[eq : kappatau ] ) .",
    "although eq.([eq : master4 ] ) is obtained by a broadly a applicable chapman - enskog method , its reduction to the telegraph form below is more restrictive and should be taken with a grain of salt for the reasons we discuss later .",
    "several versions of telegraph equation have been obtained using different methods but , unfortunately , many of them do not offer clear ordering , as e.g. , eq.[[eq : telegreqintro ] ] derived by @xcite . in an earlier treatment by @xcite , an eigenfunction expansion was truncated with no transparent assessment of discarded terms .",
    "as we mentioned already , many treatments do not systematically eliminate short time scales which are irrelevant to the long - time evolution of the isotropic part of the cr distribution . in principle , this is acceptable if the reduction scheme is based on an exact solution of the original equation , to include all required orders of approximation into the master equation .",
    "such approach , along with a nearly exhaustive analysis of the previous work has been presented in @xcite .",
    "their treatment , however , is by necessity limited to a relatively simple @xmath42 ( i.e. , power - law in @xmath3 ) .    to clarify the role of the higher order terms in eq.([eq : master4 ] ) , we note that the r.h.s . of this equation",

    "however , as the conflicting terms in both equations are the higher - order derivatives , they may stick out from their order of approximation if the solution strongly varies in space and time . in order to preserve the overall solution integrity in such events",
    "a multi- ( time)-scale or matched asymptotic expansion method is normally applied .",
    "we will argue that the telegraph equation approach to the cr transport does not handle this situation properly , as opposed to the chapman - enskog approach .",
    "but this is not to say that the two terms can not be mapped to each other , when they are well in the validity range in the above sense .",
    "note that in a number of other treatments the telegraph term was tacitly handled as one of the dominant terms .",
    "we pointed out that indeed , the term in question on the l.h.s of eq.([eq : mastereps4 ] ) is small only insofar as the @xmath2- derivative does not change its order of approximation due to strong inhomogeneity , whose scale should not be less than the m.f.p .",
    ", @xmath63 .",
    "so , assuming strong inequality @xmath178 ( or simply @xmath179 in our dimensionless variables ) , we can express the high order spatial derivatives using a zero order ( @xmath180 ) version of this equation with sufficient accuracy .",
    "the result reads :    @xmath181    this equation is indeed equivalent to the telegraph equation by its form , but the equivalence requires not only @xmath75 but also smooth variation in @xmath2 and @xmath152 , as not to raise the actual value of these terms significantly . under these equivalence conditions , both the telegraph and the hyperdiffusive transport terms",
    "are just the corrections and may be safely ignored ( especially if the @xmath173 contribution is not empty ) . on the contrary ,",
    "when the higher derivatives strongly enhance these terms , the equations can not be mapped to each other and their solutions are disparate .",
    "one of them ( or even both ) may become less accurate than the underlying leading order ( diffusive ) approximation .",
    "this is quite common situation in asymptotic expansions when the form of the next order term should be selected on the ground of the least possible singularity it introduces into the expansion ( cf .",
    "small denominator , secular growth etc . in mechanical problems ,",
    "where the higher order approximations , if handled blithely , only aggravate disagreement with true solutions ) .",
    "the telegraph term correction to the diffusive approximation appears to come from that variety , as it generates singular components ( @xmath182- and heaviside functions ) that are not only inconsistent with the strong pitch angle scattering and resulting spatial diffusion , but with the scatter - free limit of the parent differential equation itself .",
    "therefore , the singular part of the telegraph solution is inherited from the derivation of telegraph equation .",
    "we compare the telegraph and hyperdiffusion type corrections to the basic diffusive propagation somewhat further in the next section .",
    "we start with a relatively minor aspect of the differences between the two models . as we stated in sec.[sec : preliminary - considerations ] , the telegraph coefficient in eq.([eq : telegrderived ] ) is inconsistent with some of the earlier derivations . in the simplest case @xmath183 for example , after proper rescaling of @xmath152 and @xmath2 , it turns out to be smaller than the term @xmath31 in eq.([eq : telegreqintro ] ) by a factor @xmath184 . on the other hand , this is consistent with the respective result obtained by @xcite and @xcite . while the above difference may be considered rather quantitative , in the general case of @xmath185 , the appropriate equation for describing cr transport",
    "is that given by the lower , @xmath173- order , not included in eq.([eq : telegreqintro ] ) .",
    "more importantly , the telegraph version of eq.([eq : mastereps4 ] ) given by eq.([eq : telegrderived ] ) is valid only if the telegraph term ( @xmath186 , fourth order term ) remains small compared to the other terms and the original ordering in eq.([eq : mastereps4 ] ) is not violated by strong variations of the solution in space and time , as we pointed out earlier .",
    "we signify this by the `` slow '' time @xmath187 . in most other treatments @xmath82",
    "is used instead , which formally makes the telegraph term in eq.([eq : telegrderived ] ) appearing as a zero order term .",
    "it is not important , of course , whether the term is labeled by @xmath188 or not ; important is that it is treated as a subordinate term .",
    "attempts to make it dominant _ a posteriori _ violates assumptions that are essential for its derivation .",
    "this point is demonstrated below by repeating a simple calculation of the cr pulse skewness that we already made earlier working to @xmath173 order .",
    "@xcite suggested to study an asymmetry ( skewness ) of a cr pulse propagating along the field under the action of magnetic focusing using the telegraph equation .",
    "this and some other characteristics of the cr pulse , such as the kurtosis , can be easily analyzed using the primary equation ( [ eq : mastereps4 ] ) .",
    "the calculation of the pulse skewness essentially repeats the one already done at the @xmath173 level , where it is generated by asymmetric scattering , @xmath185 .",
    "so , transforming eq.([eq : mastereps4 ] ) to the reference frame moving with the speed @xmath189 , that is @xmath190 , we obtain    @xmath191    where we have , again , assumed @xmath163 .",
    "the skewness thus evolves in time as follows    @xmath192 unless @xmath193 reaches its maximum very early it is fairly small . because @xmath194 , the maximum value    @xmath195    so that an initially symmetric cr pulse develops significant asymmetry only if @xmath196 .",
    "this , however , would require @xmath197 ( or , equivalently , @xmath198 ) , in strong violation of the requirement @xmath84 , established in sec.[sec : chapman - enskog - expansion ] .",
    "note that significant pulse asymmetry obtained by @xcite using the telegraph equation was based on the fundamental solution to this equation , that is @xmath199 .",
    "we argued in sec.[sec : preliminary - considerations ] that the early propagation phase is not adequately described by the telegraph equation so that the pulse asymmetry might have been overestimated in the above paper .",
    "we specify the validity range of the telegraph equation below .",
    "starting from a long time regime @xmath200 , similarly to the @xmath173 result given in eq.([eq : feps3 ] ) , from eq.([eq : mastereps4 ] ) we find    @xmath201\\right\\ } \\label{eq : eps4longtime}\\ ] ]    this propagation regime is not much different from the regular diffusion ( first term in the square bracket ) , so both the hyperdiffusion and telegraph models produce similar results , as they are largely equivalent in this regime .",
    "it is worthwhile to write the requirement for the agreement between the two models in physical units which is simply    @xmath202 the point @xmath203 is close to the cut - off in the telegraph solution , @xmath204 ( for @xmath205 ) , eq.([eq : telintrosol ] ) .",
    "it follows then that unless @xmath206 ( @xmath50 ) , the cut - off strongly changes the overall solution .",
    "the opposite case @xmath207 , which corresponds to the initial phase of pulse relaxation , is the key to understanding the difference between the chapman - enskog and the telegraph methods . in this regime",
    "they are _ not equivalent _ , as the @xmath145 term in eq.([eq : mastereps4 ] ) can not be neglected to make the transition to the telegraph equation ( [ eq : telegrderived ] )",
    ". indeed , when propagation starts with an infinitely narrow pulse , in the early phase of its relaxation the higher @xmath2- derivatives are still too large for such transformation .",
    "a spatially narrow pulse automatically generates strong pitch angle anisotropy which , in turn , results in rapid time variation , making the telegraph term also large . it is this regime where both methods become questionable and , in addition , their predictions deviate from each other both _ quantitatively and qualitatively_. we need to check first whether they are relevant to this regime .",
    "the phase @xmath207 is well described by the chapman - enskog approach down to @xmath208 ( @xmath209 , sec.[sec : chapman - enskog - expansion ] ) .",
    "the situation with the telegraph equation is more complex , as the conversion from the chapman - enskog expansion is invalid , while independent derivations rarely provide clear ordering .",
    "a rigorous derivation in @xcite requires the same assumptions that we made when transforming the hyperdiffusive equation into the telegraph equation , that is @xmath210 ( @xmath211 under their nomenclature ) .",
    "so , the telegraph equation appears to be a subset of the hyperdiffusion equation valid only under the above ordering .",
    "it is likely to break down in the @xmath207 regime , in other words , near its cut - off .",
    "we support this premise by the following considerations .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite have carried out simulations of the full scattering problem , corresponding to eq.([eq : boltzmannrescaled ] ) .",
    "the results deviate from the telegraph solution precisely at the early phase of the pulse propagation , when the hyperdiffusion and telegraph models disagree .",
    "the two @xmath182- function pulses with sharp fronts in its solution given by eq.([eq : telintrosol ] ) are not seen in the simulations .",
    "this is understandable , as such features are inconsistent with the underlying scattering problem .",
    "they should have been smeared out by scattering earlier , since the spatial profile is shown at five collision times ( fig.2 in @xcite ) . moreover , the @xmath47 function pulses @xmath212 that are an integral part of the telegraph solution , as they maintain its normalization , are irrelevant to the primary equation ( [ eq : pascatintro ] ) , even without collisions . indeed , if @xmath213 , and the initial condition is @xmath25 being constant in @xmath3 for @xmath214 , the scatter - free solution is @xmath215 .",
    "hence , @xmath216 . therefore , a certain property of the telegraph equation allows the @xmath212 and sharp front components ( although with modified speed , eq.[[eq : telintrosol ] ] ) to survive multiple collisions .",
    "as these components are inconsistent with the underlying scattering problem , this property of the equation must have been acquired during its derivation .",
    "obviously , it is rooted in the hyperbolic ( telegraph ) operator @xmath217 that allows the singular profiles to propagate without spreading .    by contrast",
    ", the hyperdiffusion equation does not require singular components but , on the contrary , smears them out .",
    "we present an approximate solution of eq.([eq : mastereps4 ] ) after neglecting magnetic focusing in @xmath145- order terms in eq.([eq : mastereps4 ] ) .",
    "we also neglect the regular diffusion compared to the hyperdiffusion , which is acceptable during an early phase of pulse relaxation , @xmath207 .",
    "finally , we assume @xmath218 , as the solution is an even function of @xmath158 .",
    "the asymptotic result is as follows :    @xmath219    we have denoted the hyperdiffusion constant @xmath220 . more about this result and further discussion of the two conflicting approaches can be found in appendix .",
    "we see that there is a considerable slow down of the cr spreading compared to the conventional diffusion , @xmath221 , that embodies a sub - diffusive propagation , @xmath222 .",
    "this ameliorates the problem of acasual propagation in diffusion regime , yet no sharp fronts or spikes develop .",
    "by contrast , the telegraph solution to the causality problem is to cut off the solution beyond certain distance ( @xmath223 ) , thus introducing an unphysical singularity .",
    "the immediately arising normalization problem is then `` solved '' by adding an even stronger singularity in form of two @xmath182 functions at the cut - off points .",
    "using the chapman - enskog method , we have extended the cr transport equation with magnetic focusing to the fourth order in a small parameter @xmath224 ( cr mean free path to the characteristic scale of the problem ) .",
    "this analysis clarifies the nature of the telegraph transport equation , widely publicized in the literature as a promising alternative to diffusive propagation models .",
    "we have shown that the telegraph extension ( @xmath83 ) of the diffusion equation can be mapped from the ( small ) hyper - diffusive term ( @xmath225 ) of the regular chapman - enskog expansion , but the telegraph term , originating from an @xmath145 term of the expansion , must remain subordinate to the main , diffusive transport and magnetic focusing ( if present ) contributions .",
    "this condition is met after @xmath226 collision times for an initially narrow ( @xmath227 ) cr distribution .",
    "another important limitation of the telegraph equation is that , by contrast to the chapman - enskog equation and the original pitch - angle scattering equation , it is not self - contained requiring an initial condition for also @xmath15 , which needs information about the anisotropic part of the initial cr distribution .",
    "furthermore , an attempt to proceed to higher orders in @xmath68 introduces progressively shorter time scales associated with `` ghost '' terms reflecting quick relaxation of initial anisotropy or strong spatial inhomogeneity .",
    "by contrast , the classic chapman - enskog method is devised to eliminate short time scales , irrelevant to the evolution of the isotropic part of cr distribution @xmath10 , which accurately describes this evolution after a few collision times , @xmath228 .",
    "we have derived the cr transport equation for an arbitrary pitch - angle scattering coefficient @xmath42 .",
    "this form of transport equation , ( [ eq : master4 ] ) , is suitable for describing cr acceleration and escape problems where the phenomenon of self - confinement ( @xmath229 is a functional of @xmath76 , @xmath230 $ ] ) is critical , e.g. @xcite .",
    "accounting for magnetic focusing effects is required , e.g. , for describing particle acceleration in cr - modified shocks with an oblique magnetic field . in this case",
    "the field increases towards the shocks due to the pressure exerted by the accelerated crs on the flow , thus producing a mirror effect .",
    "the particle drift velocity along the field associated with the mirror effect is ( e.g. , eq.[[eq : eps3 ] ] ) @xmath231 which , for the magnetic field variation scale being of the order of the shock precursor scale @xmath232 and strong shock modification , almost automatically becomes comparable with the shock velocity @xmath233 .",
    "this additional bulk motion of the accelerated cr ( directed towards the shock ) will affect their spectrum and acceleration time .",
    "furthermore , as the cr scattering in such environments ( i.e. , supernova remnant [ snr ] shocks ) must be self - sustained by virtue of instabilities of the cr distribution ( see , e.g. , @xcite for the recent reviews ) , the above magnetic drift needs to be included in the cr stability analysis .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the results obtained in the present paper formally require a magnetic field @xmath234 that does not strongly change over the gyro - radius of energetic particles .",
    "this is not to be expected in snr shocks , especially if strong , cr current- and pressure - driven instabilities generate fields with @xmath235 .",
    "however , one may use the shock normal direction as the polar axis to calculate the pitch angle diffusion coefficient @xmath42 , needed for the description of the cr spatial transport .",
    "also , such treatment will require a description of the gyro - motion and averaging by computing particle orbits beyond the standard quasi - linear description @xcite , implied throughout this paper .    in conclusion , by comparison with the telegraph equation ,",
    "the classic chapman - enskog hyper - diffusion equation consistently describes the long - term cr propagation in a self - contained , order controlled fashion .",
    "further improvement of the cr diffusion models should probably address the anisotropic component of the cr distribution .",
    "there are situations , such as ultra - high energy cr propagation , where the mean free path grows too long with the energy as to make the diffusive approach irrelevant and a rectilinear transport to dominate @xcite ( cf .",
    "levi flight regime described in aforementioned study by @xcite ) .",
    "another interesting example is a sharp angular anisotropy @xmath236 in cr arrival directions discovered by milagro observatory @xcite and a number of other instruments , e.g. @xcite . unless this anisotropy is of a very local origin ( such as heliosphere , @xcite , it poses a real challenge to cr propagation models and clearly can not be addressed within the diffusive approaches discussed in this paper @xcite . on the other hand , when the diffusive transport model is well within its validity range ( weakly anisotropic spatially smooth cr distributions ) neither the telegraph nor the hyper - diffusive term ( both@xmath176 ) is essential to the cr transport and can be neglected .",
    "useful and stimulating comments of the referee are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "the work of mm was supported by the nasa atp - program under the grant nnx14ah36 g .",
    "he is also indebted to the university of maryland for hospitality and partial support during this work .",
    "partial support from us doe is also appreciated .",
    "to derive the result given by eq.([eq : hypdifsmalltau ] ) , we rewrite eq.([eq : mastereps4 ] ) for a simple case of weak focusing ( @xmath237 ) and using the galilean transform to the frame moving at the magnetic drift velocity @xmath238 @xmath239 :      where @xmath220 and @xmath177 is the same as in eq.([eq : mastereps4 ] ) .",
    "the fundamental solution of eq.([eq : appenddiffhyperdiff ] ) can be written as an inversion of the fourier image @xmath241 , assuming that @xmath242 . as we are going to find the fourier inversion using asymptotic methods",
    ", we write an arbitrary constant @xmath243 instead of this value :      we will determine the normalization constant @xmath243 shortly from the requirement @xmath245 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following notation : @xmath246 we may limit our consideration to the @xmath247 half - space , because the solution is an even function of @xmath158 . focusing on a short time asymptotic regime @xmath248 which is opposite to the case considered",
    "earlier ( eq.[[eq : eps4longtime ] ] ) we neglect the diffusive term @xmath249 in the exponent ( as hyperdiffusion dominates ) and rewrite eq.([eq : apgensol ] ) as follows      note that the general evaluation of the integral in eq.([eq : apgensol ] ) , with the diffusive term included , is not difficult but more cumbersome .",
    "the phase of the integral here has three saddle points , and the following two should be on the integration path    @xmath251 since the integrand reaches its maxima at these points .",
    "so , the integration runs from @xmath252 through @xmath253 to @xmath254 then to @xmath255 and , finally to @xmath256 .",
    "the contributions from the two saddle points then yield      the normalization @xmath258 requires the constant @xmath259 , which only insignificantly deviates from the exact value @xmath260 that , in turn , follows from the integral representation of @xmath76 in eq.([eq : apgensol ] ) for @xmath261 .",
    "note that we could have replaced an oscillating exponential tail of this solution by zero beyond the point @xmath262 .",
    "such modification of the hyperdiffusive solution would be in the spirit of the telegraph cut - off at @xmath204 , however , with an essential difference of being only a discontinuity in the solution derivative .",
    "the unphysical ( oscillatory ) behavior beyond the first zero point of the solution in eq.([eq : apfinsol ] ) results from neglecting the diffusion term in eq.([eq : appenddiffhyperdiff ] ) , asymptotic methods used to calculate the integral in eq.([eq : apapproxint ] ) , and from lacking higher order terms , @xmath263 .",
    "therefore , the solution can be improved systematically .",
    "in addition , it starts from a point source which is clearly inconsistent with the main approximation @xmath75 .",
    "a somewhat broader initial profile will not develop an oscillatory tail , if convolved with the green s function in eq.([eq : apgensol ] ) .",
    "we will not attempt to improve on this minor aspect of the solution here , as it becomes only weakly irregular if cut off at its first zero .    from the perspective of a general improvement of the asymptotic expansion considered in this paper , the derivation of eqs.([eq : skew4 ] ) , for example ,",
    "is robust in the following sense .",
    "the residual higher order terms in @xmath75 , if included in eq.([eq : mastereps4 ] ) , will not change eqs.([eq : skew4 ] ) in any other way than small corrections to the coefficients @xmath177 and @xmath264 .",
    "indeed , the higher @xmath2- derivatives coming from higher order terms , will vanish from the ( first four ) moment equations after integrating by parts .",
    "by contrast , continuing the telegraph approach to higher orders will generate terms with small parameters at higher time derivatives in all moment equations .",
    "these terms will become crucial during the initial relaxation of the cr distribution .",
    "the relaxation is associated with the cr anisotropy or strong initial inhomogeneity , that is with large @xmath265 , sec.[sec : chapman - enskog - expansion ] . however , these decay over a short time @xmath266 .",
    "this is the time period when the telegraph or hyperdiffusive correction is large but its effect on the subsequent evolution ought to be limited as this time is short .",
    "the hyperdiffusive correction meets this requirement , as we argued using moment equations . to see whether the same is true for the telegraph correction ,",
    "let us rewrite eq.([eq : telegrderived ] ) using the `` fast '' time , @xmath267 :      where we denoted @xmath269 and assumed @xmath205 , to make the following simple argument .",
    "namely , in the limit @xmath180 there are two modes , of which the first is @xmath270 .",
    "this is the main diffusion mode that slowly evolves in time when @xmath271 , and , as we are interested in the evolution over the time scales @xmath137 , the telegraph term becomes @xmath176 and can be discarded .",
    "the second mode corresponds to a rapid decay of the initial distribution @xmath272 which is associated with the decay of initial anisotropy or strong inhomogeneity . if this mode is active ( @xmath15@xmath273 in eq.[[eq : apptelegrrescaled ] ] ) , then even the total number of particles @xmath46 is not conserved automatically .",
    "so , turning to the moments of eq.([eq : apptelegrrescaled ] ) we need to impose the initial condition , @xmath274 , to ensure the particle conservation .",
    "this probably means that @xmath180 is a difficult limit for the telegraph reduction scheme .",
    "the singular components in the telegraph solution ( [ eq : telintrosol ] ) appear to be primarily associated with the particle conservation problem .",
    "the initial relaxation phase ( @xmath266 ) perhaps , can not be adequately described by the telegraph reduction scheme using an equation for @xmath10 alone , as it does not properly `` average out '' an anisotropic component @xmath18 , which is large during this period of time .",
    "the telegraph term is therefore to be understood as a `` ghost '' term reflecting rapid decay of such components .",
    "it follows that the rapidly changing part @xmath18 in the decomposition in eq.([eq : fndecomp ] ) needs to be retained in the short - time analysis along with @xmath10 . otherwise , the telegraph operator generates unphysical @xmath182- pulses and sharp fronts , just to conserve the number of particles , as discussed earlier .",
    "these considerations are , however , not nearly complete .",
    "further useful analysis of propagation modes in the context of telegraph equation can be found in @xcite .    to conclude this appendix",
    "we make yet another argument in disfavor of the telegraph equation that is partially related to the above considerations .",
    "a consistent asymptotic reduction method must be continuable to infinity in powers of small @xmath68 .",
    "the chapman - enskog scheme clearly is .",
    "the outcome will be a series of terms @xmath275 on the r.h.s . of eq.([eq",
    ": master4 ] ) with just @xmath51 on its l.h.s . to solve the resulting equation ,",
    "only the initial distribution @xmath276 is needed , as the equation remains _ evolutionary _ and ( generalized ) parabolic , as its pitch - angle diffusion superset is .",
    "the telegraph equation , on the contrary , turns hyperbolic and non - evolutionary after the reduction from the superset equation . by continuing the telegraph reduction scheme to higher orders of approximation ,",
    "progressively higher _ time derivatives _ will emerge ( along with higher space derivatives ) .",
    "the resulting equations will thus be non - evolutionary and a growing set of initial time derivatives @xmath277@xmath10 will then be needed to solve the initial value problem .",
    "these data can be extracted only from the full anisotropic distribution with recourse to the full ( anisotropic ) equation .",
    "therefore , the telegraph equation is not self - contained and can not be improved systematically . any attempts to improve it will introduce shorter and shorter time scales that would require a return to the full anisotropic description ."
