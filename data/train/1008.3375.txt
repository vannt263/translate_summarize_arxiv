    "the flatness of the potential in these models appears because of the nonminimal interaction of the inflaton field to gravity @xcite .",
    "this class of theories has many interesting and unusual properties , which were recently revealed in the context of the superconformal approach to supergravity @xcite .",

    "as we will see , by adding the terms term @xmath26 to the potential of these models , just as it was done for the models considered in @xcite , one can render the @xmath24 field heavy , which then reduces the investigation of such models to the investigation of simple one - field models of chaotic inflation .",

    "recently there was a wave of interest in the possibility to implement inflation in the standard model @xcite .",
    "the main idea was to introduce a large nonminimal coupling of the higgs field to the curvature scalar , of the type of @xmath32 .",
    "after that , one can make a transformation from the jordan frame to the einstein frame , which eliminates the term @xmath32 and makes the potential of the higgs field sufficiently flat to support inflation @xcite .    for a long time it was not quite clear whether one can use this mechanism in supersymmetric models .",
    "in the standard derivation of the lagrangian of matter coupled to supergravity , one starts with a superconformal theory and then fixes the conformal compensator to be proportional to the planck mass .",

    "even when the superconformal symmetry is broken and @xmath45 , the potential in the jordan frame may be relatively simple , as one can infer from eq .",
