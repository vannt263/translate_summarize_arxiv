    "although the measurement of photon - number statistics gives an incomplete description of the optical state , it can be helpful to provide fundamental information on the nature of any optical field and hence to discriminate between light of different kinds , either in the classical or non - classical domain .",
    "measuring the photon - number statistics is a difficult task as it requires a complete knowledge of the entire detection process . in some situations , the evaluation of",
    "the first two statistical momenta can be enough for characterizing light statistics .",
    "in particular , mean value and variance , combined into the fano factor , can discriminate between different statistics , even if sometimes the evaluation of higher order momenta is necessary .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that it is possible to determine the photon - number statistics by means of a direct intensity measurement performed with linear photodetectors endowed with internal gain . in order to bypass the problem of calibrating the detector ,",
    "we devise a measurement technique that takes advantage of the linearity properties of the detector and is based on the measurement of the same state at different mean numbers of photons . in this way",
    "we simultaneously obtain the calibration of the detection chain and the reconstruction of the photoelectron statistics .",
    "our technique has the additional advantage of being applicable to fields in the mesoscopic intensity regime ( less than 1000 photons ) , which is scarcely explored .    the competing techniques for determining the photon - number distributions are for instance : tomography with homodyne detection @xcite , measurement with internal - gain photodetectors able to resolve peaks of different photoelectron numbers , plus analysis of peak integrals in order to reconstruct the photoelectron number distribution @xcite . drawbacks of the latter approach are : the low - limit in the mean number of detected photons due to the low quantum efficiency ; the need of independent calibration of the detector ; the need of a guess on the statistics to which the data must be fitted , as there is no direct indication from the measurement @xcite .",
    "if the measurements are performed with linear photodiodes lacking internal gain , the drawbacks is the low - limit to the mean number of detected photons ( p - i - n photodiodes can detect down to one thousand photons upon external amplification @xcite ) .",
    "a further alternative is represented by on / off measurements combined with maximum likelihood reconstruction @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : teo ] presents the theoretical model we will use to interpret the experimental data , section [ sec : exp ] describes the experimental setup used for the measurements and section [ sec : analysis ] presents the technique for analyzing the data and the experimental results .",
    "finally we draw some conclusions .",
    "we can model the detection process as a two step process : photodetection by the photocathode and amplification ( both internal to the detector and external ) ( see fig .  [",
    "f : scheme ] ) .",
    "we start from the observation that a real photodetector , having quantum efficiency @xmath0 , behaves like a perfect detector ( @xmath1 ) preceded by a beam spitter ( bs ) with transmittance @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the photodetection process can thus be described as the convolution of the photon statistics with the bernoullian action of the bs @xcite .",
    "the statistics of the number of photoelectrons emitted by the photocathode , @xmath3 , is thus linked to the statistics of the number of photons , @xmath4 , by @xmath5 if we limit our analysis to the first two momenta of the distributions , the links between the statistics of photons and photoelectrons are given by @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mean value and @xmath8 is the variance . the same notation is adopted for photoelectrons .    a complete description of the amplification process requires the detailed knowledge , for each particular detector , of the amplification mechanism .",
    "however for the present discussion we limit ourselves to those detectors and to those operating regimes in which the amplification process can be simply considered as linear : we adopt a strongly simplifying approach in which the spread of the single photoelectron peak in the detector output is negligible as compared to its mean value .",
    "the relation linking the statistics of photoelectrons to that of the voltage outputs , even at the end of the electronic chain external to the detector , is then @xmath9 being @xmath10 the amplification / conversion coefficient given by the overall amplification process and signal - processing electronics .",
    "quite obviously , eq .  ( [ eq : outs ] ) shows that in general the distribution of the output voltage values is different from that of the photoelectrons .",
    "for the first two momenta of the distributions , the experimental final outputs are given by @xcite @xmath11 where the symbols are defined as above .",
    "the most difficult task to be performed for reconstructing @xmath12 from @xmath13 is the experimental determination of the parameter @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : outs ] ) . this task can be tackled by following a procedure based on repeated measurements of the same state of light at different values of the quantum efficiency by inserting neutral filters in front of the detector . in particular",
    "we evaluate the following quantity    @xmath14}}{{\\alpha \\eta \\bar{n } } } = \\alpha \\eta f + \\alpha \\left ( { 1 - \\eta } \\right)=\\alpha \\eta q + \\alpha , \\label{eq : fano}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is the fano - factor that we have re - written as @xmath16 , @xmath17 being the mandel q - factor @xcite .",
    "we observe that @xmath18 is linearly dependent on @xmath19 and that @xmath10 can be obtained as the limit of @xmath18 at @xmath20 . by multiplying and dividing by @xmath21",
    "we get @xmath22 which now expresses @xmath18 as a function of the mean value of the measured output voltage .",
    "note that @xmath23 varies because of the variation of @xmath19 and not because of the change in the measured state ( @xmath24 remains the same ) .",
    "the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fanoq ] ) is general and all the information about the specific state under measurement is contained in the angular coefficient @xmath25 , which is zero for poissonian light , positive for classical super - poissonian light and negative for nonclassical sub - poissonian light . by measuring the same light state at different values of @xmath23 and evaluating @xmath18 ,",
    "we can directly obtain the value of @xmath10 and the ratio @xmath24 .",
    "of course , different light states may have , for some values of the parameters , the same value of @xmath24 and this prevents the possibility of the unique determination of the light statistics .",
    "nevertheless , if an assumption can be made on the statistics of the measured light , the method allows one to check it immediately .",
    "the expected expressions of @xmath18 for the states presented in this paper will be given in section  [ sec : analysis ] , where the results are discussed .",
    "in fig .  [ f : setup ] we show the adopted experimental setup .",
    "the light from the specific source to be investigated is collected by a multimode fiber ( 100 @xmath26 m core diameter , oz optics , canada ) . as the detector we used either a photomultiplier tube ( pmt , 8850 , burle industries , maximum quantum efficiency @xmath27 at 400  nm ) or a hybrid photodiode module ( hpd , h8236 - 40 , hamamatsu , japan , maximum quantum efficiency @xmath28 at 550  nm ) .",
    "both detectors are endowed with partial photon resolving capability and are linear over a wide range of intensities .",
    "the current outputs of the detectors are integrated ( sgi , stanford research systems ) , sampled and digitized ( adc , national instruments ) .",
    "the final outputs are then recorded by a computer .    as a preliminary check of the performances of the detectors , we simultaneously measured the light at the two outputs of a 50% beam splitter ( bs in fig .",
    "[ f : setupbis ] ) dividing a ps - pulsed coherent beam at 523  nm .",
    "the light was obtained from the second harmonics of a nd : ylf continuous - wave mode - locked laser amplified at 500  hz repetition rate ( high - q laser production ) . in fig .",
    "[ f : response ] we show a typical pulse - height spectrum of the pmt ( @xmath29 ) and of the hpd ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the zero value of the output voltage @xmath31 is set at the mean value of the response to dark of each detector , which was measured independently ( see _ e.g. _ the horizontal scale in figs .",
    "[ f : response ] ( @xmath29 ) and ( @xmath30 ) ) .",
    "a standard procedure for analyzing a pulse - height - spectrum is to find a suitable fit obtained as a multiple convolution of the function best fitting the single - photon peak @xcite .",
    "the procedure allows the reconstruction of a limited number of peaks ( that depend on the resolving capabilities of the detectors ) and fails in analyzing more intense fields when the pulse - height spectrum does not show well recognizable peaks .",
    "the pulse - height spectrum of the detectors lose the peak structure as soon as the field intensity becomes mesoscopic , still remaining proportional to the field intensity .    in fig .",
    "[ f : linearity ] we show several pulse height spectra recorded by the pmt ( @xmath29 ) and by the hpd ( @xmath30 ) in the same configuration of fig .  [ f : setupbis ] , in which neutral density filters are inserted on the beam path before the beam splitter . in fig .",
    "[ f : linearity ] ( @xmath32 ) we plot the mean values of the output voltage as a function of the transmittance of the filters : the difference between the two curves reflects the difference in the overall quantum efficiency of the two detectors at 523  nm .",
    "the linearity will play a key role in the analysis procedure described in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "we measured different light fields characterized by different statistics and at wavelengths that were chosen so as to match the highest quantum efficiencies of the detectors at best .",
    "the aim of the measurements is to identify the type of light field , to determine the overall amplification / conversion coefficient @xmath10 and to reconstruct the statistics of the photoelectrons .",
    "the steps of the experimental procedure are : 1 ) to measure the same field at different attenuations of the neutral density filters ( the actual position of the filters depends on the specific measurement ) ; 2 ) to evaluate the mean value and the variance of the output voltage ; 3 ) to plot the experimental values of @xmath18 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : fano ] ) ) as a function of the mean value @xmath23 ; 4 ) to fit the plot to a straight line , thus obtain the value of the @xmath10 factor , and to find , according to one of the theoretical models , the parameters of the photoelectron distribution ; 5 ) to use the fitting parameters to recover the photoelectron statistics .",
    "first of all we consider the measurements performed on ps - pulsed coherent light at 523  nm obtained as above ( see fig .",
    "[ f : setup ] ( @xmath29 ) ) . for a coherent field",
    "we expect a poissonian photon - number distribution @xmath33 for which mean value and variance are @xmath21 .",
    "note also that the photoelectron distribution obtained by applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : phel ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq : poiss ] ) remains poissonian , so that @xmath34 with the substitution @xmath35 .",
    "the fano factor for the final output voltage becomes @xmath36 independent of the mean value @xmath23 .",
    "the experimental results obtained with the pmt are shown in fig .",

    "the expected photon - number distribution is given by the convolution of @xmath26 independent thermal modes @xcite @xmath38 for which the mean value is @xmath21 and the variance is @xmath39 . as in the case of coherent light , the photoelectron distribution obtained by applying eq .",
