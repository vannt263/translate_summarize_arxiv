    "x - ray monitoring of 4u 2206 + 54 by rxte suggested a modulation period of 9.6 days ( corbet & peele 2001 ) which may be an orbit period , but this period disappeared with recent swift / bat observations ( corbet et al .",

    "if it is true , the compact object in 4u 2206 + 54 will be a neutron star with a spin - period of 5500 seconds .    in this work , we will study hard x - ray characteristics of 4u 2206 + 54 with the integral / ibis observations from 2003 may to 2005 december .",

    "two cyclotron resonant absorption lines ( fundamental and first harmonic ) were found in the spectrum of the active states during 2005 dec , while in the quiescent states , no cyclotron line features are detected . the existence of cyclotron absorption lines suggested a strong magnetic field in 4u 2206 + 54 , and the high energy emission in active states would mainly come from magnetosphere near the neutron star .",

    "it is the first time that we detected both the fundamental and second harmonic of the cyclotron resonant absorption lines in the x - ray binary 4u 2206 + 54 .",

    "discovery of the cyclotron resonant absorption lines at @xmath11 and 60 kev strongly suggested a magnetic neutron star located in the binary 4u 2206 + 54 .",
    "we can calculated the value of the magnetic field of the neutron star in 4u 2206 + 54 by using the formula = [ e_cycl/11.6kev](1+z ) , where @xmath43 is the energy of the fundamental line , here @xmath44 kev , and @xmath45 is the gravitational redshift near the surface of the neutron star . for a canonical neutron star of 1.4 with a radius of 10 km , we can take @xmath46 ( kreykenbohm et al .",

    "the high mass x - ray binary 4u 2206 + 54 shows a variable x - ray light curve .",
    "intensive searches for the pulsation period of 4u 2206 + 54 have been performed with exosat ( corbet & peele 2001 ) , rxte ( negueruela & reig 2001 ; torrejon et al .",
    "2004 ; corbet et al .",
    "2007 ) , bepposax ( torrejon et al . 2004 ; massetti et al . 2004 ) and integral ( blay et al . 2005 ) . however , these studies suggested the lack of the x - ray pulsation on timescales from @xmath48 ms to @xmath49 hr .",
    "recently , reig et al . (",
    "2009 ) use the new rxte observational data to search for the pulsation period longer than 1 hr , and discovered a possible 5500-s pulsation period in the light curve of 4u 2206 + 54 .",
    "in addition , the early rxte / asm data suggested a modulation period of @xmath50 days ( corbet & peele 2001 ) , but the swift / bat data reported a period of @xmath51 days ( corbet et al .",
    "2007 ) , so that corbet et al . ( 2007 ) suggested the orbit period should be 19.25 days instead of 9.6 days . here",
    "we will check these period reports with recent data of integral / ibis and rxte / asm .",
    "we have reported the cyclotron resonant absorption line features during the active state in 4u 2206 + 54 , suggesting that during the active state , the x - ray emission mainly coming from the surface of the neutron star .",
    "so we try to search for a pulsation period using the light curve data during the active state .",
    "we applied the fft to the observational intervals from dec 5 to 12 , 2005 .",
    "the power spectrum was shown in figure 5 , binned at 100 s intervals .",
    "a significant period signal was found at @xmath52 s ( figure 5 right ) .",
    "this period is a little lower than that reported by reig et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , but still consistent considering the error bar range .",
    "thus , 4u 2206 + 54 should be a x - ray pulsar with a very slow pulsation .",
    "the folded light curve of 4u 2206 + 54 at a pulsation period ( 5400 s ) is also shown in figure 6 .",
    "a possible double main peak feature appears in the pulse profile , one at @xmath53 and the other around 0.6  0.9 .    since the available database during the active state",
    "is limited to less than 7 days , we can not search for the longer modulation period ( like orbit period , possible @xmath5 9.6 d or 19.2 d ) with the integral database during the active state of 4u 2206 + 54 .",
    "we used archival rxte / asm data with observations from 1997  2008 to search for the orbit period in 4u 2206 + 54 .",
    "firstly , we averaged the asm 1.5  12 kev light curves into 1 hour bins . after subtracting the mean value of all inhabited bins from each inhabited bin , we take an fft to the light curve .",
    "the power spectrum is shown in figure 7 . in the top panel of fig .",
    "7 , we have shown a power spectrum in a wider frequency range , and no significant signal was found in the high frequency range ( @xmath54 hours ) , while two significant peaks were detected in the lower frequency range .",
    "then in the bottom panel , from the zoom - in of the low frequency band , we determined two modulation periods at 9.56@xmath55 days and @xmath56 days ( twice the former one ) .",
    "so we confirm the existence of the possible orbit periods reported by both the early rxte / asm data ( corbet & peele 2001 ) and the recent swift / bat observations ( corbet et al .",
    "2007 ) . in figure 8 , the folded light curves of 4u 2206 + 54 using the rxte / asm data at two modulation periods at 9.56 day and 19.11 day were also displayed separately .",
    "a possible peak at @xmath57 days also appeared in the power spectrum though not significantly yet , which may be just a noise signal .",
    "in this paper , we studied the hard x - ray emission of the high mass x - ray binary 4u 2206 + 54 with integral / ibis observations to reveal the nature of the compact object .",
    "in hard x - ray bands , 4u 2206 + 54 undergone both the quiescent and active states . in the quiescent state ,",
    "the 20  150 kev spectrum of 4u 2206 + 54 can be fitted by a power - law model with @xmath58 , and no cyclotron absorption line features are found . while , in the active state , two cyclotron absorption lines at @xmath11 kev and 60 kev are discovered in the hard x - ray spectrum . with known the cyclotron resonant absorption energy , we determined the magnetic field of @xmath59 g for the compact object in 4u 2206 + 54 .",
    "analysis of the x - ray light curve during the active state , we also found a modulation period of @xmath60 s which would be a pulsation period for a neutron star .",
    "thus we identified the compact object in 4u 2206 + 54 as a magnetic neutron star with a very slow pulsation .             from the asm light curve of 4u 2206 + 54 , we found two modulation periods of @xmath5 9.56 days and the twice , 19.11 days .",
    "then which one is the real orbit period in 4u 2206 + 54 ?",
    "one possibility is that the 19.11-day period is just the first harmonic of the 9.6-day period .",
    "but the swift / bat data only found one period at 19.2 days , and recent rxte / asm data from 2004  2006 showed the modulation period at 19.1 days , not significantly at 9.6 days yet ( corbet et al .",
    "2007 ; we also folded the light curve at 9.6 day using the rxte / asm data after 2003 , no significant features were detected in phase profiles ) .",
    "then the 9.6 day period was not a permanent signal in x - ray light curve .",
    "then appearance of 19.2-day period may not be the first harmonic of 9.6 day .",
    "in addition , optical radial velocity measurements ( blay et al .",
    "2006 ) have not shown the period at 9.6 days but the power spectrum of the complete set of radial velocity observations suggested a peak at @xmath61 days , which was interpreted as an artifact .",
    "modulation of x - ray emission on the orbit period in a high mass x - ray binary may occur in different ways as follows .",
    "firstly , if the orbit is eccentric , the peak emission would occur at periastron passage ( @xmath62 assumed by rib et al . 2006 ) . in this case , it is difficult to understand why two periods appeared in the x - ray light curve .",
    "in addition , an eccentricity of @xmath63 was suggested from the x - ray light curve analysis ( reig et al .",
    "2009 ) , so 4u 2206 + 54 has a modestly eccentric orbit .",
    "in the second case , if the orbit plane is inclined to the plane of an equational circumstellar disc , two possible outbursts could occur when the neutron star passes through the disc .",
    "this scenario has been proposed to explain two modulation periods detected in two x - ray binaries : a be / neutron star binary gro j2058 + 42 ( corbet et al .",
    "1997 ) and a supergiant system 4u 1907 + 09 ( mashall & ricketts 1980 ) .",
    "though 4u 2206 + 54 has the difference in the nature of the mass donor , the orbit behavior may be similar to the case in gro j2058 + 42 and 4u 1907 + 09 .",
    "therefore , we suggested that the orbit period of 4u 2206 + 54 should be @xmath5 19.11 days , which was consistent with the conclusion by corbet et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .    in hard x - ray band",
    ", only the orbit period at @xmath64 days could be found with swift / bat observations ( corbet et al .",
    "2007 ) , while in soft x - ray band of 1.5  12 kev , we found two modulation periods .",
    "if the 9.6-day period is due to the neutron star passing through the equational plane of the mass donor , soft x - ray emission may be affected by the enhanced wind around the disc , but hard x - ray emission has no significant dependence on it .",
    "therefore , the hard x - ray emission above 20 kev and its variation pattern should have a different origin from those in the soft x - ray band , which requires more studies .",
    "in the be star / neutron star binary systems , there exists a possible correlation between orbit period and pulse period ( corbet 1986 ) .",
    "though 4u 2206 + 54 have a different mass donor but may be still similar to a be star system , it is predicted to have a pulse period of a few second for a orbit period of 19.11 days according to the correlation , which however is unconsistent with the pulsation period of @xmath5 5400 s reported in this work ( maybe @xmath5 5560 s , also see reig et al .",
    "two high mass x - ray binary systems also show the similar behavior away from the correlation : a0538 - 66 with an orbit period of 16.7 days has an short pulse period of 69 ms ( skinner et al . 1982 ) and sax j2103.5 + 4545 with an orbit period of 12.7 days has a longer pulse period of 358.6 s ( baykal et al .",
    "generally , the 19 day orbit period is relatively short for a be star system .",
    "therefore , the orbit - pulse period correlation would be unvalid at the short orbit period . from pulse period versus orbit period diagram ( see reig et al .",
    "2009 ) , 4u 2206 + 54 fall into the wind - fed supergiant system region which was consistent with the proposed wind - accretion scenario from the x - ray emission properties ( corbet & peele 2001 ; rib et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "though we have now confirmed the nature of the compact object in 4u 2206 + 54 , many questions on this high mass x - ray binary are still unclear , requiring further studies in both theories and observations .",
    "origin of the low - pulsation neutron star in 4u 2206 + 54 is a mystery according to the present scenario of the neutron star s spin evolution in a close binary system ( davies & pringle 1981 ; li & van den heuvel 1999 ) .",
    "so reig et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggested that the neutron star in 4u 2206 + 54 was born as a magnetar with @xmath65 g which was used to explain the long pulsation period of 2s 0114 + 65 ( li & van den heuvel 1999 ) .",
    "since the donor star of 4u 2206 + 54 is a main sequence massive star , the magnetic field of the neutron star decaying from @xmath66 g to 10@xmath67 g during wind accretion processes within several million years is also questionable .",
    "there exist other possible ways to resolve the problems , like x - ray pulsar in 4u 2206 + 54 may not follow the present standard evolution models in close binaries .",
    "some numerical simulations suggested that no significant angular momentum transfers onto the neutron star from the wind of supergiant systems ( ruffert 1999 ) . in the case of 4u 2206 + 54 with a magnetic neutron star ,",
    "it is possible that the calculations ( ruffert 1999 ) were inapplicable , so that the 5000-s pulsation period was formed during the wind - fed accretion phase .",
    "we discovered cyclotron resonant absorption lines at @xmath11 kev 60 kev in the active state of 4u 2206 + 54 , but no detection of cyclotron lines in the quiescent state .",
    "in previous studies , the possible detection of electron cyclotron absorption line at @xmath39 kev was reported by observations of rxte , beppossax and integral(torrejon et al .",
    "2004 ; masetti et al . 2004 ; blay et al . 2005 ) .",
    "but recent rxte observations by reig et al . ( 2009 ) did not find the cyclotron line at @xmath11 kev similar to the quiescent state reported in this paper .",
    "then from the present data , cyclotron lines could be detected when the hard x - ray luminosity ( 20 100 kev ) is higher than @xmath68 erg s@xmath2 ( also see blay et al .",
    "we suggested that in the active state ( like @xmath69 erg s@xmath2 ) , hard x - ray emissions will mainly come from the surface ( e.g. , polar cap region ) of the neutron star , while in the quiescent state , the x - ray emission would mainly come from the standing point region where the magnetic pressure is equal to the accretion pressure .    among the wind - fed massive binary system , 4u 2206 + 54",
    "is a unique one which was identified as a magnetic neutron star with a very low pulsation .",
    "thus , detailed studies and long - term monitoring of the peculiar neutron star binary 4u 2206 + 54 in x - rays will help to understand accretion physics and evolution of wind - fed systems .",

    "<S> the hard x - ray source 4u 2206 + 54 is a peculiar high mass x - ray binary with a main - sequence donor star . </S>",
    "<S> recent x - ray observations suggested that the compact object in 4u 2206 + 54 may be a neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray emission comes from the accretion of stellar winds from the massive donor stars , and variability of luminosity may be due to the changes of its orbit phase . to further reveal the nature of compact object , we studied 4u 2206 + 54 with integral / ibis observations in two years , and found that in most time , 4u 2206 + 54 undergone a quiescent state and sometime an active state . in the quiescent state the spectrum can be fitted by a power - law model of @xmath0 with a hard x - ray luminosity of @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 ( 20 100 kev ) . while in the active state </S>",
    "<S> , the 20 100 kev hard x - ray luminosity reaches @xmath3 erg s@xmath2 and the spectrum is fitted by a thermal bremmstrahlung model of @xmath4 kev plus two cyclotron absorption lines at @xmath5 30 and 60 kev . </S>",
    "<S> then we derived a magnetic field of 3.3@xmath6 g for the compact object in 4u 2206 + 54 . during the active state </S>",
    "<S> , we found a pulsation period of @xmath5 5400 s in the light curve of 4u 2206 + 54 . </S>",
    "<S> so the compact object in 4u 2206 + 54 should be a magnetic neutron star with a slow pulsation . </S>",
    "<S> cyclotron absorption lines detected in the active state and non - detection in the quiescent state suggested that two different accretion states have possible different hard x - ray emission regions : surface of neutron star in the active state ; the magnetic - accretion pressure equivalent point in the quiescent state . </S>",
    "<S> the re - analysis of the rxte / asm light curve found the modulation periods at @xmath7 days and 19.11 days , and the orbit period of 4u 2206 + 54 should be 19.11 days .    </S>",
    "<S> stars : individual ( 4u 2206 + 54 )  stars : neutron  magnetic fields  stars : binaries : close  x - rays : binaries . </S>"
