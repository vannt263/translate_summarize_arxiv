    "the recently discovered new superconductor @xmath0 becomes very attractive due to its potential applications@xcite .",
    "one important issue concerns however in which region on the field - temperature ( h - t ) phase diagram it can carry large critical current density ( @xmath2 ) and thus can be used in the future for industry .",
    "this @xmath2 is controlled by the mobility of the magnetic vortices , and vanishes above the melting line between the vortex solid and liquid .",
    "this melting can be induced by strong fluctuation of the vortex position by either thermal effect or quantum effect . at t = 0",
    "k only the quantum fluctuation is left . a finite linear resistivity @xmath3 will appear above this melting point showing the reversible flux motion .",
    "most of the published results on the flux dynamics of @xmath0 system were obtained from bulk samples@xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the investigation on the flux dynamics on an @xmath0 thin film by dynamical magnetic relaxation method .",
    "the thin films of @xmath0 were fabricated on ( 1102 ) @xmath4 substrates by using pulsed laser deposition technique@xcite . the amorphous b thin film was first deposited and then it was sintered at a high temperature in mg vapor .",
    "the films are typically 400 nm thick with predominant c - axis orientation ( c - axis is perpendicular to the film surface ) . a rectangular sample of size @xmath5 was chosen for the magnetic sweeping measurement .",
    "the magnetic measurements were carried out by a quantum design superconducting quantum interference device ( squid , mpms 5.5 t ) and a vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm 8 t , oxford 3001 ) at temperatures ranging from 2 k to @xmath6 and external field up to 8 t. for the magnetic sweeping measurement the m(h ) curve was measured with different field sweeping rates ( 0.005 t / s to 0.02 t / s ) and integral time of 60 ms to 960 ms .",
    "the pressure of he gas in the sample chamber for thermal exchange was kept at 0.4 bar during the measurement .",
    "the superconducting transition is sharp with the transition temperature @xmath6 of about 38 k as observed from the temperature dependence of magnetization .",
    "in fig.1 we show the magnetization hysteresis loops ( mhl ) measured at temperatures ranging from 2 k to 37 k. the symmetric mhls observed at temperatures up to 37 k indicate the dominance of the bulk current instead of the surface shielding current .",
    "the mhls measured at low temperatures , such as 2 k to about 10 k show dense and small flux jumps in the low field region leading to a smearing of the superconducting critical current density .",
    "it is this effect that makes the width of the magnetization @xmath7 below 10 k be anomalously smaller than that at 14 k , which is discussed elsewhere@xcite . from these mhls",
    "one can calculate @xmath2 via @xmath8 based on the bean critical state model , where v , a and b are the volume , width and length of the sample , respectively .",
    "the result of @xmath2 is shown in fig.2 .",
    "it is clear that the magnetic critical current density @xmath2 of our sample is rather high .",
    "for example , at t = 18 k and @xmath9 = 1 t , we have @xmath10 , which is about one order of magnitude higher than that of high pressure synthesized bulk samples@xcite .    for investigating the flux dynamics",
    "the @xmath11 curves have been measured with two different field sweeping rate 0.02 t / s and 0.01 t / s. it is interesting to note that although for bulk samples@xcite there is a small tail on each mhl in high field region , here on the thin film sample there is no such tail . accordingly",
    "the @xmath11 curves show neither a small tail in high field region .",
    "this further corroborates our earlier suggestion that the small tail observed in bulk samples is due to some secondary effect , such as some local regions with very strong pinning or the surface pinning by the tiny grains . in the present thin film sample with much better uniformity",
    "this effect is certainly disappeared . from the contour of @xmath2 vs. h shown in fig.2 one",
    "can see that all the curves have two different regions . in the low field region",
    "@xmath2 drops slowly with h. when the field is increased further and exceeded a threshold the @xmath2 decreases drastically showing the gradual setting in of the reversible flux motion .",
    "one can determine the phase transition line which separates the irreversible and the reversible flux motion by taking a criterion , here for example @xmath2 = 1000 @xmath12 .",
    "the same criterion was used by bugoslavsky et al . for bulk samples@xcite . since our measurement",
    "was done at a maximum field of 8 t , for low temperatures we use a reasonable extrapolating way , i.e. , to follow the tendency of @xmath2 vs. h at a higher temperature , for example at 10 k or 14 k , down to the criterion @xmath2 = 1000 @xmath12 to derive the irreversibility field .",
    "this method , although with some uncertainties for the values of @xmath13 at low temperatures , will lead us to derive an almost complete curve of @xmath13 .",
    "the error bar of @xmath13 at 2 k is about @xmath14 0.5 t. the irreversibility lines by following this method is shown in fig.3 together with that from a high pressure synthesized bulk sample .",
    "similar to what found in bulk samples @xcite , it is easy to see in the present thin film that the @xmath13 extrapolates to a rather low field , for example , @xmath15 0.5 t , while the @xmath16 extrapolates to a much higher value ( @xmath17 15 t ) @xcite at zero k. there is a large separation between the two fields @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this effect observed both in bulk and thin film samples may suggest that the relatively low @xmath13 in @xmath0 is not due to the easy flux motion through some weak pinning channels , rather it reflects probably a more intrinsic property , specialy in a rather clean system .",
    "if following the hypothesis of the vortex liquid above @xmath13 , we would conclude that there is a large region for the existence of a quantum vortex liquid at zero k. this can be attributed to a quantum fluctuation effect of vortices in bulk @xmath0 .",
    "although the lowest temperature in our present experiment is 2 k , however , from the experimental data one can not find any tendency for @xmath13 to turn upward to meet the @xmath18 at zero k. this may indicate that the vortex melting in our present film is due to the strong quantum fluctuation which smears the perfect vortex lattice leading to the vanishing of the shear module @xmath20 of the vortex matter ( probably within grains ) .",
    "dense disorders will strengthen the shear module and thus enhance the irreversibility line , that s why the @xmath21 in present thin film is higher than that in bulks ( shown in fig.3 ) .",
    "the irradiation of protons by bugoslavsky et al.@xcite did not suppress but strongly increase @xmath2 at a high field would suggest that the low value of @xmath22 measured in unirradiated bulks and present thin film is not due to the weak links since otherwise the @xmath2 value would drop even faster with increasing the magnetic field after the irradiation .    in order to investigate the flux dynamics in the vortex solid state below @xmath21 we have carried out the dynamical magnetic relaxation measurement .",
    "assuming an uniform current density over the cross - section of a superconducting ring , one can determine the superconducting current density @xmath2 from the magnetic moment m via    @xmath23    where d is the film thickness , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the outer and inner radius of the ring , respectively .",
    "it is important to note that the magnetic moment m in eq.(1 ) is understood as being due to only the superconducting current excluding any additional contribution from an equilibrium magnetization . in other words ,",
    "m is obtained by subtracting from the zfc magnetic moment with the equilibrium magnetic moment as determined from the fc process , i.e. , m = m ( measured ) - m ( equilibrium ) . for a superconducting thin film",
    "the equilibrium magnetic moment is normally negligible since the volume of the superconducting material is very small .",
    "based on different external conditions , there are two techniques to measure the magnetic relaxation , namely the so - called conventional and dynamical relaxation .",
    "the so - called conventional relaxation is to measure the time dependence of the superconducting current density @xmath2 at a certain temperature and field @xcite . after a waiting time when the magnetic field is fixed ( or say field sweeping is stopped ) , the first data point is taken .",
    "for a conventional relaxation measurement , total observation time should be very long .",
    "the second method is the so - called dynamical relaxation , i.e. , to measure the mhl with different field sweeping rate .",
    "one can easily understand the difference between these two methods from the electromagnetic response of a superconducting ring .",
    "the electromotive force in a ring is    @xmath26    where e is the electric field established within the ring , @xmath27 , h is the external field , @xmath28 $ ] is the self - inductance of the ring @xcite , @xmath29 is the width of the ring . for the relaxation process , since @xmath30 = 0 , the electric field can be determined by    @xmath31\\frac{dj_c}{dt}\\ ] ]    this method is inapplicable when the irreversible magnetic signal is comparable to the equilibrium magnetization . for @xmath0 with a very narrow mhl this method shows a clear drawback",
    ". however one can choose the so - called dynamical relaxation method@xcite .",
    "this technique can be accomplished by using the sensitive vsm or a torque magnetometer . in a field",
    "sweeping process , if the field sweeping rate is high enough , the last term in eq.(2 ) can be neglected , therefore the electric field e can be determined by    @xmath32    and @xmath2 can be determined from the width of the micro - hysteresis loops around a certain field via @xmath8 based on the assumption that the current density @xmath2 is uniform throughout the cross section of the ring @xcite .",
    "since the vortices are forced to move by the external field sweeping , this process is thus called as the dynamical relaxation @xcite . for a superconducting disc the magnetic moment",
    "is contributed mainly from the current circulating near the perimeter of the sample .",
    "for example , the 7/8 of the total magnetic moment is contributed by the current flowing from 1/2r to r of a superconducting disc , where r is the radius of the disc .",
    "therefore from a rough estimation , it is safe to derive the e(j ) or v(i ) relation for a disc sample by using eq.(4 ) . as indicated in@xcite and @xcite",
    ", the normalized relaxation rate can be determined via @xmath33 in the dynamical relaxation process , and it should be identical to @xmath34 determined in the conventional relaxation process .",
    "later on wen et al.@xcite , perkins and caplin @xcite and ji et al . @xcite have shown that the conventional relaxation , dynamical relaxation and the dc transport method should give the same information of flux motion although the voltage range is different .",
    "( voltage in the dynamical relaxation is much higher than that in the conventional relaxation ) .",
    "the raw data with two different field sweeping rate ( 0.02 t / s , 0.01 t / s ) are shown in fig.2 .",
    "the q values vs. field for different temperatures are determined and shown in fig.4 .",
    "it is clear that the relaxation rate increases monotonically with the external magnetic field and extrapolates to 100% at about the melting point @xmath21 . at 2 k",
    "it is found from the q(h ) data that the melting field ( where q = 1 ) is about @xmath35 t , being close to @xmath36 determined from the @xmath11 curve .",
    "it is known that the @xmath13 is rather stable in low temperature region , therefore we can anticipate a rather low value of @xmath19 which is below 10 t being much lower than @xmath18 . as already pointed out in our earlier publication@xcite , the large separation between @xmath37 and @xmath18 may manifest the existence of the quantum vortex liquid due to strong quantum fluctuation of vortices in the pure system of @xmath0 .",
    "theoretically , quantum melting of the vortex solid has been proposed by some authors@xcite and preliminarily verified by experiments.@xcite .",
    "solid evidence is , however , still lacking mainly because either the values of @xmath19 and @xmath38 are too high to be accessible , such as in the classical chevrel phase pbmos system@xcite , or the separation between them is too small @xcite leading to a difficulty in drawing any unambiguous conclusions .",
    "here we try to have an rough consideration on the quantum melting field @xmath39 proposed by blatter et al.@xcite for 2d system ,    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the lindermann number , @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the sheet resistance .",
    "since the new @xmath0 sample has a much higher charge density and thus a much lower sheet resistivity , according to above relation , @xmath39 should be more close to @xmath18 comparing to @xmath44 superconductors ( hts ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the experimental observations which may be explained as that the @xmath0 is not a quasi-2d system .",
    "another approach was proposed by rozhkov and stroud@xcite ,    @xmath45    with @xmath46 , where s is the spacing between layers , @xmath47 is the pair mass , q the pair charge ( @xmath48 ) , c the light velocity , @xmath49 the penetration depth at zero k , @xmath50 0.1 .",
    "if comparing again the present new superconductor @xmath0 with hts , @xmath49 , q and @xmath51 are more or less in the same scale , the difference comes from @xmath47 and s. therefore a preliminary conclusion would be that in @xmath0 either the pair mass @xmath47 or the layer spacing s is much smaller than that of hts .",
    "a strong quantum fluctuation normally favors a strong quantum tunneling creep . in order to see that , we plot in fig.5 the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate q. it is clear that there is a clear residual relaxation rate for all fields and the relaxation rate in wide temperature region keeps rather stable against the thermal activation and fluctuation . according to the thermally activated flux motion model    @xmath52    where e is the electric field due to tafm over the activation energy @xmath53",
    ", @xmath54 is the average velocity of the flux motion , b is the magnetic induction .",
    "the relaxation rate is    @xmath55    for any kind of @xmath56 relation , a finite slope of @xmath57 is expected .",
    "therefore a much stronger temperature dependence of q should be expected for thermally activated flux motion .",
    "this is in contrast to the experimental data .",
    "however , when the melting point @xmath13 is approached the relaxation rate will quickly jump to 100% .",
    "this may indicate that the thermal fluctuation is not the dominant process for the flux depinning in the new superconductor @xmath0 .",
    "it shows high possibility for the vortex quantum melting even at a finite temperature .",
    "worthy to note is that the quantum tunneling rate is extremely low at an intermediate field , such as q = 0.3% at 2 k and 2 t , but is rather high at a high field , for example q = 20% at 2 k and 7 t. this may imply that the field will greatly enhance the vortex quantum fluctuation and tunneling .",
    "the small relaxation rate at a relatively low field has also been measured by thompson et al.@xcite who regarded it as a highly stable superconducting current density in @xmath0 .",
    "actually the relaxation rate can be rather high when the magnetic field is increased to a higher value .",
    "the extremely small relaxation rate and weak temperature dependence at a finite temperature at a low field is probably induced by a strong pinning barrier relative to the thermal energy , i.e. , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the intrinsic pinning energy .",
    "recently it was concluded@xcite that the @xmath59 is in the scale of 1000 k being much higher than the thermal energy @xmath60 .",
    "therefore for the new superconductor @xmath0 the pinning well is too deep leading to a trivial influence of the thermal activation and fluctuation .",
    "it thus naturally suggests that the quantum fluctuation and tunneling plays an more important role . therefore , together with the fact discussed in last subsection , it is tempting to suggest that at a finite temperature the melting between a vortex solid and a liquid is due to quantum fluctuation instead of the thermal fluctuation .",
    "in conclusion , in a thin film sample of @xmath0 , the flux dynamics and the irreversibility field are investigated .",
    "just like in the bulk samples , is is found that the irreversibility field is rather low comparing to the upper critical field in low temperature region showing the possible existence of the quantum vortex liquid due to strong quantum fluctuation .",
    "the weak temperature dependence but strong field dependence of the relaxation rate may further suggest that the vortex melting at a finite temperature is also induced by the strong quantum fluctuation .",
    "the reason for such a strong quantum effect is still unknown , but it may be related to the superconducting mechanism of @xmath0 , such as the relatively low upper critical field .",
