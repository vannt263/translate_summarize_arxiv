    "due to advances in our understanding of the premelting of ice and other materials over the last fifteen years @xcite , and an increasing appreciation of the influence and extent of this phenomenon in technological , terrestrial and extraterrestrial settings , it is prudent to revisit the detailed thermodynamic basis of its manifestation in porous media where water is invariably found in adsorbed layers or in bulk . in 1992",
    "cahn , dash , and fu ( cdf ) @xcite developed the original premelting based theory for the liquid fraction @xmath0 of water in a porous medium at sub - freezing temperatures . given experimental and theoretical advances in the interim , we extend their work in a number of respects .",
    "cdf considered a matrix of monodisperse spheres arranged either in a simple cubic packing or in a cubic close packing , regarded as lower and upper bounds for the experimental systems .",
    "we design our theory for the _ random _ close packing of monodisperse spheres , which may be a more realistic description for most applications , e.g.  frozen soils , where even a small degree of polydispersity prevents a periodic packing of the matrix particles .",
    "the assumed periodic packing of the matrix particles leads cdf to take the grain size of the interstitial ice to be on the order of the size of the matrix lattice unit cell .",
    "given that the degree of polycrystallinity of the interstitial ice has a complicated dependence on the freezing rate ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "* and references therein ) and the sample annealing history , the ice grain size may differ substantially from the matrix particle size .",
    "whence , polycrystallinity of the interstitial ice enters into our theory as a parameter , namely the density of grain boundary surface relative to the interstitial volume .",
    "calculations since cdf showed that the dispersion force contribution to interfacial melting could be repulsive or attractive @xcite and thus favor or suppress melting in a manner and strength that depends on the effective dielectric response of the ice / water / matrix interface .",
    "moreover , it has been understood that the great inter - experimental variability in both the interfacial and surface melting of ice was likely due to the sensitivity of the phenomena to impurities which have a rich and complex influence on the melting behavior @xcite .",
    "thus , our theory allows for both attractive and repulsive dispersion forces of arbitrary strength ( depending on the matrix material ) and includes the effect of charges at the interface , which give rise to an electrostatic force .",
    "finally , most importantly , our work includes the effect of charged impurities in the premelted liquid on both interfacial and curvature induced premelting .",
    "the article is structured as follows . in section  [ sec_theory ]",
    "we lay out the tenets and details of our theory , discussing interfacial premelting and curvature induced premelting in the presence of charged impurities and combine them in order to describe premelting in a porous medium .",
    "the final result of the theoretical treatment is an implicit functional equation for the liquid fraction @xmath0 , eq .  .",
    "the first part of section  [ sec_analysis ] is dedicated to the analysis of interfacial premelting as described by eq .  , and in the second part eq .   for the liquid fraction @xmath0",
    "is analyzed by extracting exact solutions for certain limiting cases and numerical solution in the general case . the porous media which we consider consist of fused quartz , gold , and silicon .",
    "we summarize in section  [ sec_sumconc ] .",
    "in order to calculate the equilibrium thickness @xmath1 of a premelted layer for a given undercooling @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the bulk melting temperature of ice and @xmath4 is the temperature of the system , we consider a three layer planar system .",
    "layer @xmath5 is given by the substrate , i.e. , in the case of interfacial melting , the layer consists of the material which forms the porous medium , or of ice when grain boundary melting is considered .",
    "layer @xmath6 is the premelted quasi - liquid layer of thickness @xmath1 and finally layer @xmath7 consists of ice . in what follows",
    "we consider the complete free energy of the system and then focus on the individual complications and contributions in turn to show how known asymptotic results emerge from the theory .",
    "it is assumed that layer @xmath6 contains a certain amount of impurities .",
    "the gibbs free energy of the system per unit area is given by @xmath8 + \\mathcal{i}(d ) \\",
    ", , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath9 are temperature and pressure , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the chemical potentials per mole of the solid , the liquid , and the impurity species , respectively , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the numbers of mole per unit area of the solid , the liquid , and the impurities , respectively .",
    "the term @xmath16 $ ] , where @xmath17 is the gas constant , corresponds to the mixing entropy of the impurities assuming low impurity concentration so that the ideal gas result applies .",
    "finally , @xmath18 denotes the total effective interfacial free energy described in more detail below .",
    "note that @xmath1 is directly proportional to @xmath14 through @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the molar density of the liquid which is a constant in the calculation .    the solid ( ice ) and",
    "the liquid ( water ) parts of the system can exchange material and hence the condition for thermodynamic equilibrium is given by @xmath21 applying this criterion to the free energy given above , and using the fact that @xmath22 where @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the specific entropy of the solid ( liquid ) , we can approximate @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the latent heat of melting per mole and arrive at @xmath27 in the absence of interfacial forces we have @xmath28 , and the result reduces to @xmath29 , where the molar density of impurities is @xmath30 .",
    "this undercooling corresponds precisely to the classical colligative effect ",
    "the depression of the bulk freezing temperature due to dissolved impurities . obviously , compared to the force free case , repulsive interfacial forces for which @xmath31 result in a larger undercooling @xmath32 thereby enhancing the layer thickness .",
    "conversely , attractive interfacial forces wherein @xmath33 suppress the formation of a premelted liquid film . indeed , for sufficiently large @xmath32 , eq .",
    "may have no solution showing that the attractive interfacial forces can dominate the colligative effect of the impurities and the premelted liquid layer will vanish .",
    "the interfacial energy has two contributions ; @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is due to dispersion forces , acting between the three interfaces defining the system , and @xmath36 captures the effect of immobile charges at the interface .",
    "although we compute the strength of the dispersion force interaction from the full frequency dependent theory @xcite , we take the small thickness limit in which only non - retarded forces contribute to @xmath35 which consequently can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the hamaker constant for the given layered system @xcite . for symmetric systems , such as the ice - liquid - ice configuration , which occurs in the case of grain boundary melting ,",
    "@xmath38 is _ positive _ and hence dispersion forces are _",
    "attractive_. at the interface between the ice and the porous matrix @xmath38 can assume both signs , depending on the material properties of the porous medium .",
    "immobile surface charges with a given surface charge density @xmath39 on both interfaces which bound the quasi - liquid layer are screened by the counterions in the liquid . making use of the debye - hckel theory",
    "this leads to the contribution @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the vacuum permittivity , @xmath42 the relative permittivity of liquid water , and @xmath43 is the debye length for monovalent ions , with the electron charge @xmath44 , avogadro s number @xmath45 , and boltzmann s constant @xmath46 .",
    "the debye length describes the characteristic decay of the ion field adjacent to the charged surface due to the screening by counter ions .",
    "a repulsive force between two charged surfaces originates in the restriction of the entropy of the ions as the surfaces are brought closer . whereas ions of charge opposite to those of the surface",
    "are attracted to it , they are repelled from each other , and the increased proximity induced by decreasing the film thickness increases the free energy . note the relatively complex @xmath1-dependence of @xmath36 which is due to the fact that @xmath47 is also a function of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the richness of the role of impurities in the premelting of ice is a consequence of this and the efficient segregation of ions into the film ; since nearly all of the impurities remain in the liquid , as the temperature changes the _ amplitude _ and _ range _ of the repulsive electrostatic interaction varies @xcite . in principle , the situation could be even more complex when for example @xmath39 = @xmath48 .",
    "indeed , when @xmath1 is small the debye - hckel expression is less accurate and steric effects become more important .",
    "however , to introduce such complications here exceeds our understanding of the situation based on present experimental evidence .    using these expressions for @xmath34 in eq .",
    "we obtain an implicit equation for the thickness @xmath1 of the premelted layer as a function of the undercooling @xmath32 : @xmath49 e^{-c\\sqrt{n_i d}}\\ , , \\ ] ] where the constant @xmath50 is @xmath51 this result is analyzed in detail in section  [ sec_reslayer ] .      in order to assess the effect of the ice - liquid interfacial curvature on the freezing temperature , we neglect the known anisotropy of the surface energy of ice @xcite and consider a spherical ice crystal of radius @xmath52 surrounded by undercooled water . as opposed to the planar case , the interfacial area is no longer a constant as it was in the treatment of section  [ sec_mechlayer ] . with this new complication",
    "we reconsider the gibbs free energy @xmath53 of the _ total _ system . the same holds for the numbers of moles @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 which are now taken for the total system and not per unit surface .",
    "for ease of notation we use the same symbols for these new quantities .",
    "all other quantities are as defined above .",

    "we note here that we understand that @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the angle that defines the surface normal .",
    "thus , the surface energy , itself a gibbs free energy conjugate to area , is known in general to depend on the size of the system , the adsorption of impurities and the crystallographic orientation @xcite but the simplification of treating it as a constant is justified both on the basis of experimental evidence for the first two dependencies and on the level of our analysis .    the condition for thermodynamic equilibrium is again @xmath59 and hence a calculation analogous to that in the section  [ sec_mechlayer ] yields the result @xmath60 or , for the general case of a surface with principal radii of curvature @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 this result is the well known gibbs - thomson effect , i.e. the freezing point depression due to convexity of the ice - liquid interface , calculated here for the case where impurities are present in the liquid water .",
    "the larger the undercooling @xmath32 , the smaller the radii of curvature of an ice - liquid interface in equilibrium . at the bulk freezing point ,",
    "@xmath64 , the radius of curvature diverges and a planar interface is the stable configuration .",
    "we use the random close packing ( rcp ) of hard spheres as a model for the porous matrix .",
    "apart from choosing the matrix material and hence calculating the properties which enter the determination of the hamaker constant ( see section  [ sec_mechlayer ] ) , the only free parameter characterizing the porous matrix which contains the partially premelted ice is the radius @xmath65 of the hard spheres .",
    "the properties of rcp hard spheres which are required for our calculation are the sphere packing fraction @xmath66 and the average coordination number @xmath67 .",
    "recent estimates of these numbers @xcite are @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the basic concept of rcp is not well defined mathematically , so these numbers vary slightly according to the protocol and algorithm used to determine the exact configuration @xcite .    at a given undercooling @xmath32 we are interested in the fraction of the interstitial volume which is occupied by quasi - liquid water @xmath0",
    "which we will more compactly refer to as the liquid fraction .",
    "the first contribution we consider comes from interfacial premelting at the surface of the porous matrix . in the limit where the premelted layer is much thinner than the radius of the matrix particles , @xmath70",
    ", this fraction is well approximated by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the surface area of the matrix particles per unit volume and @xmath1 is obtained from eq .",
    "using the hamaker constant @xmath73 for the ice - water - matrix layered system and the appropriate surface charge density @xmath74 .",
    "the sphere number density of the matrix is @xmath75 and thus we obtain @xmath76 and @xmath77    the second contribution to the liquid fraction is due to grain boundary melting .",
    "its importance depends sensitively on the grain size of the interstitial ice , which is a function of such factors as ( 1 ) the rate of cooling , ( 2 ) the undercooling @xmath32 , and ( 3 ) the time allowed for annealing .",
    "even were we to attempt a complete computation of the coarsening rate of the ice grains in the matrix , there is no unique way to specify the initial value problem and hence to arrive at a concrete grain size as a function of the properties of the porous matrix .",
    "thus , we introduce as an additional parameter the grain boundary density @xmath78 , which is the surface area of grain boundaries per unit volume of the interstitial ice .",
    "we denote @xmath79 as the related dimensionless density .",
    "the corresponding liquid fraction follows immediately @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the hamaker constant for the ice - liquid - ice layered system and @xmath82 is the surface charge density for the grain boundary .",
    "the thickness @xmath1 of the quasi - liquid layer is again obtained from eq .  .",
    "we now deal with curvature induced premelting .",
    "important contributions to the liquid water fraction come from regions where the ice - liquid interface has a large curvature . in our idealized matrix",
    "these are the points where two matrix spheres are in contact .",
    "following cdf @xcite there is a liquid pocket forming at the contact point with a volume @xmath83 to lowest order in @xmath52 , which is the radius of curvature of the ice - liquid interface ( fig .  [ fig_contactpoint ] ) .",
    "taking into account that the second principal radius of curvature is much larger than @xmath52 , we can use eq .   to relate @xmath52 to the undercooling @xmath32 :",
    "@xmath84 using the number density @xmath85 of the sphere matrix and the matrix coordination number @xmath67 we can express the corresponding fraction of liquid water with respect to the total interstitial volume : @xmath86 ^ 2 r}{1-\\eta } \\nonumber \\\\                           & = & \\frac{3}{2 } \\times \\frac{\\eta}{1-\\eta } \\times \\frac{\\mathcal{c}}{2 } \\times \\left[\\frac{r(\\delta t , \\rho_i)}{r}\\right]^2 \\ , , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath87 from eq .  .    .",
    "the amount of premelted liquid depends on the characteristic radius of curvature @xmath52 of the ice - liquid interface as obtained from eq .  .",
    "depending on the matrix material there is either always a premelted liquid layer ( repulsive dispersion forces , @xmath88 ) or the premelted layer may collapse under certain conditions ( attractive dispersion forces , @xmath89 ) and the liquid - ice interface forms an angle @xmath90 with the matrix surface .",
    "for parsimony of presentation we show the neighboring matrix spheres of different materials while the present theory assumes porous media made up of a single material . ]",
    "a further curvature induced contribution to the liquid fraction brought out by cdf comes from the lines where a grain boundary and a matrix sphere meet .    in the limit that the matrix particles are small on the scale of the linear scale of the ice grains , but that @xmath65 is much larger than @xmath87",
    "the corresponding liquid fraction can be calculated using elementary geometry ( see appendix  [ app_grainbmat ] ) @xmath91 ^ 2 .",
    "\\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    finally , curvature induced premelting gives rise to liquid veins along the lines where several grain boundaries meet . with the simplifying assumption that the ice grains are arranged in a cubic packing , the total length of veins per interstitial volume , or the density of veins @xmath92 , is obtained from @xmath93 as @xmath94 .",
    "given that the cross - sectional area of a vein in cubic packing is @xmath95 , we can calculate the corresponding contribution to the liquid fraction as @xmath96 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\                           & = & \\frac{1}{3}(4-\\pi ) \\times \\tilde{\\rho}_{gb}^2 \\times   \\left(\\frac{r(\\delta t , \\rho_i)}{r}\\right)^2   .",
    "\\qquad \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    therefore , the total liquid fraction is obtained as the sum of the five individual contributions which we have derived above ; @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "thus far we have taken impurities into account in terms of a molar density @xmath99 or , in the case of the premelted layer , a surface density of impurities @xmath100 .",
    "laboratory probes using scattering or related approaches involve relatively small samples with good thermal control and a well defined ( fixed for a given run ) dopant level @xcite .",
    "the temperature changes in these systems are quasi - static so that the sample is at coexistence . in the natural environment",
    "there are of course temperature gradients .",
    "therefore , for applicability of our work there , the typical broad temperature gradients found for example in natural soils imply that a local region within will be nearly isothermal and thus isosaline",
    ". clearly , there will be many environmental circumstances where this may be violated , but because the first test of such a theory should be of high precision we focus mainly on the simplest experimental setting and exploit the fact that the impurity segregation coefficient of ice is small @xcite so that the premelted liquid is enriched / diluted when the system is cooled / warmed .",
    "hence it is prudent to introduce @xmath101 , the molar density of impurities in the interstitial water when the system is above the bulk melting temperature .",
    "thus , because of the validity of the assumption that impurities are contained almost exclusively in the liquid fraction of the interstitial water it follows that @xmath102 thereby properly accounting for the increase in the impurity concentration in the premelted liquid as the liquid fraction decreases . due to the fact that the regions of premelted water are all interconnected , @xmath99 is homogeneous over the entire sample .",
    "having now considered the essential physical phenomena we can formulate an equation for the total liquid fraction @xmath103 in the porous medium as a function of the undercooling @xmath32 and the impurity concentration @xmath101 in the completely melted sample . combining all the contributions discussed in section  [ sec_premeltporous ] , we obtain @xmath104 which is an implicit function for @xmath105 and in the general case has no analytical solution . moreover , the underlying equation for the thickness @xmath1 of the premelted layer , which is required for @xmath106 and @xmath107 , is itself an implicit function of @xmath1 .",
    "this calls for a careful stepwise analysis first of eq .   and subsequently of eq .  , which we perform in sections  [ sec_reslayer ] and [ sec_resliquidfr ]",
    "in section  [ sec_mechlayer ] we derived eq .   for the thickness @xmath1 of the premelted layer as a function of the undercooling @xmath32 , the impurity concentration @xmath15 , the dispersion forces as embodied in the hamaker constant @xmath38 , and the surface density @xmath39 of immobile charges on the solid - liquid interfaces .",
    "this expression can not be solved analytically in the general case .",
    "hence , presently we analyze eq .",
    "analytically , to demonstrate that we can obtain known distinguished limits and facilitate intuition , and numerically , to provide specific ranges of results for particular physical systems of interest .",
    "we begin by rewriting this equation in terms of the reduced , or dimensionless , undercooling @xmath108 as follows @xmath109 where the constants @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 . for",
    "_ attractive _ dispersion forces which _ suppress _ premelting we have @xmath113 , and for _ repulsive _ dispersion forces which _ promote _ premelting we have @xmath114 .",
    "all other quantities in eq .",

    "the thickness @xmath1 of the liquid film is them simply given by @xmath117 representing the colligative effect of the dissolved impurities which , due to the small segregation coefficient of ice , are strongly enriched in the liquid layer .",
    "the situation immediately becomes more complex if we take dispersion forces into account .",
    "let us first consider materials that have @xmath113 , which means that dispersion forces suppress the formation of a premelted liquid film .",
    "assuming @xmath116 for the moment , eq",

    "we obtain the global maximum @xmath124 by extremizing the right hand side of eq .   with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "two limiting cases can be distinguished . for large impurity concentrations @xmath15",
    "the contribution due to surface charges becomes negligible and hence we recover the result @xmath125 for the case @xmath116 which we derived above . on the other hand , it can be shown that in the limiting case @xmath126 the values @xmath123 and @xmath122 follow from the surface charge dominated limit ( @xmath127 and @xmath115 ) which has @xmath128 in fig .",
    "[ fig_dmin ] we plot the minimal thickness @xmath123 of the quasi - liquid layer corresponding to the maximal undercooling @xmath122 as a function of the impurity concentration @xmath15 for different values of the surface charge @xmath39 .",

    "@xcite for the ice / liquid / fused quartz layered system .",
    "the analytical results for @xmath126 and @xmath130 are characterized by the @xmath15-dependencies of the asymptotic behavior .",
    "note that the minimal thickness in the dispersion force dominated limit ( @xmath131 ) is below @xmath132 and therefore equal to the dimension of a single molecule .",
    "hence , the notion of a quasi - liquid layer can no longer be applied and for the ice / liquid / fused quartz system layer collapse can only be observed experimentally at low impurity concentrations and it is always triggered by surface charges .",

    "immobile surface charges alone are sufficient to stabilize a premelted layer .",
    "second , while eq .",
    "implies that @xmath1 decreases when the impurity concentration @xmath15 is increased , the opposite conclusion follows from eq .   where , due to the term @xmath142 , the inhibition due to surfaces charges is reduced when @xmath15 increases",
    ".    the apparent contradiction can be reconciled by the following observations . a direct consequence of eq .",
    "is that immobile surface charges do not contribute to the film thickness @xmath1 when the latter equals the debye length , namely @xmath143 , in which case the surface charge term vanishes .",
    "the film thickness @xmath144 translates into an undercooling @xmath145 .",
    "for an undercooling @xmath146 surface charges enhance the formation of a quasi - liquid layer while for @xmath147 surface charges suppress layer formation . considering that eq",
    ".   applies to the @xmath148 case while eq .   to the @xmath139 case",
    ", this explains the essential difference between eqs .   and in terms of whether they support or suppress the formation of a liquid film .",
    "in order to isolate the dependence of @xmath1 on the impurity concentration @xmath15 we consider eq .   in the case",
    "where dispersion forces can be neglected ( @xmath115 ) and the immobile interfacial charge density is small ( i.e.  @xmath149 ) .",

    "<S> both interfacial premelting and curvature induced premelting depend on the concentration of impurities in the liquid , which , due to the small segregation coefficient of impurities in ice are treated as homogeneously distributed in the premelted liquid . </S>",
    "<S> our principal result is an equation for the fraction of liquid in the porous medium as a function of the undercooling , which embodies the combined effects of interfacial premelting , curvature induced premelting , and impurities . </S>",
