    "we propose a new jastrow - type ansatz , which in its general form reads : @xmath21 above @xmath22 is the two - body exact solution ( eq .

    "we confirm also that the two approaches make exactly the same predictions in the extreme limits @xmath70 , because in both cases the bethe ansatz exactly coincides with the jastrow .",
    "this is another reason why to construct the jastrow ansatz from this particular pair function . for a rather strong interaction @xmath71 ( or equivalently @xmath72 ) the deviation of the jastrow ansatz energy from the exact solution @xmath73 takes its maximum value ,",
    "[ see red smooth thin curve ( fig .  [ fig1](b ) ) ] , which is nonetheless very small ( lower than @xmath74 ) .",

    "therefore the non - variational jastrow has a deviation of the same order of magnitude from the exact solution ( red smooth thin curve ) and from the variational jastrow ansatz ( orange dotted thin curve ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "this allows us to treat the variational jastrow ansatz as a very good approximation of the exact solution also in the non - integrable case .    therefore lacking an exact solution in the latter case we compare the non - variational jastrow ansatz with the variational one .",
    "we observe that the deviation acquires its minimum values not only at very weak and very strong interactions , but also for an intermediate interaction strength ( the additional minimum of the non - integrable cases : @xmath53 ( brown dotted thick line ) , @xmath52 ( magenta dashed thick line ) , @xmath51 ( cyan smooth thick line ) and @xmath50 ( black dashed - dotted thin line ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) .",
    "this is another trace of the broken integrability scenario , which seems to approach a jastrow type of correlations at three interaction strengths rather than two as in the integrable case .",

    "[ fig1](c ) we plot also the behavior of the optimal parameter @xmath26 for the variational jastrow ansatz as a function of @xmath31 for different values of @xmath36 . here",
    "we observe that interestingly for the integrable case ( red smooth thin curve ) the optimal value of @xmath26 is always lower than @xmath27 , which corresponds to the non - variational value , and also that it deviates more from 1 for low @xmath31 .",
    "for the non - integrable cases : @xmath53 ( brown dashed - dotted thin line ) , @xmath52 ( magenta dotted thin line ) , @xmath51 ( cyan dashed thin line ) and @xmath50 ( black smooth thick line ) we see an oscillation of the variational parameter first to higher and then to lower than @xmath27 values",
    ". also let us note that the deviation to higher values for lower @xmath36 tends to go very high , but this without improving much the energy as we have seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ( corresponding to a very smooth plateau for the variational optimization ) .",

    "all the results above indicate already that there are different behaviors for different @xmath76 values .",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) that the energy deviation ( @xmath77 ) from the integrable @xmath45 value ( corresponding to the horizontal axis ) is more abrupt for lower values of the interaction ( @xmath36 ) .",

    "[ fig2](c ) and ( d ) the two - body density @xmath84 of the majority pair of atoms is plotted for an integrable and a non - integrable case , respectively .",
    "the main effect here is the additional very pronounced minima of this function on the wings around the diagonal .",
    "the diagonal ( @xmath85 ) correlation hole is due to the repulsive contact interaction between this majority pair and is present in both cases .",
    "however , when the impurity interacts strongly with the majority pair it produces a strong suppression of the density around the relative distance of @xmath86 . due to the homogeneous space",
    "the two - body density is symmetric , so a complete characterization of the effects can be done just by cutting the off - diagonal section of fig .",

    ", width=15,height=15 ]    let us now discuss the consequences of violating integrability in terms of correlations in jacobi coordinates , defined as : @xmath88 and @xmath89 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we observe the effect of breaking the integrability in the off - diagonal plots of these block figures , which are all asymmetric compared to the diagonal ones , which in turn are completely symmetric and correspond to the integrable case @xmath45 .",
    "notice also that the figures in the diagonal are very similar to the corresponding ones in the trapped case ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this means , basically , that the trap does not produce a big impact in the central region of the correlation functions , where the contact repulsive potential is dominant . on general grounds",
    ", one may interpret each diagram as follows : the @xmath90 jacobi coordinate represents the position of the impurity , depending on the position of the center of mass of the majority atoms .",
    "therefore the symmetry of the correlation function breaks when the interactions between the atoms are different , due to the change of preference in ordering the particles . in general the pairs experiencing stronger repulsions tend to avoid each other , also producing a rearrangement with the third particle .    beyond these general remarks",
    "one can see in detail in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the following features :    \\i ) on the uppermost row , where @xmath91 , we have the two - body situation , since the impurity does not interact with the majority atoms . as the interaction between the majority atoms increases , going from left to right in this row , there is a depletion of the density ( a correlation hole ) at the meeting point of the atoms ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the profile along the vertical axis , representing the position of the impurity with respect to the center of mass of the majority atoms , is obviously homogeneous , due to the absence of interaction .",
    "\\ii ) this situation changes if we add the interaction with the impurity ; for instance , as we go from up to down in the first column , we notice that the impurity particle tends to be at the center of mass of the majority atoms if the latter are in a large distance , while it shifts to the edges if the majority atoms are close together .",
    "the majority atoms tend to separate from each other if the interaction with the impurity is strong and the impurity lies at their center of mass .",
    "this is an interesting situation , since the majority atoms are not directly coupled ( in this column @xmath56 ) , but the indirect coupling via the impurity shifts the correlation profile , as well as that of the impurity itself with respect to their center of mass .",
    "\\iii ) as we move from left to right in all rows the main effect is the appearance of the correlation hole in the middle of the vertical line at @xmath92 due to the increasing interaction between the majority atoms .",
    "so the maxima which are still there in all left graphs and have support at the line @xmath92 tend to split into two and separate completely as @xmath36 increases .",
    "therefore one feature that differentiates most of the plots of the bottom left triangle of this figure compared to the upper right one , i.e. , the cases @xmath62 and @xmath61 , respectively , is the separation of the majority pair , happening exactly at the integrable point . at the bottom",
    "left triangle we may have splitting but not separation .       or @xmath36 parameter increases , according to the corresponding labels next to the leftmost figure of each row .",
    "within each figure the other @xmath31 or @xmath36 parameter changes with the following color order of increasing @xmath31 or @xmath36 : blue dashed thin line , red dashed thick line , green dotted thick line , brown dotted thin line , magenta dashed - dotted thin line , cyan dashed - dotted thick line , black smooth thin line .",
    ", width=15,height=15 ]    we now consider the correlation function of the distance between two atoms , which corresponds to the anti - diagonal cross section of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( c ) and ( d ) ( or also to integrating out the @xmath90 jacobi coordinate ) .",
    "we provide in the appendix the analytical formulas for both the integrable and non - integrable cases of the majority - majority @xmath93 correlations as well as the impurity - majority ones @xmath94 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the obtained analytical expressions are ploted for representative values of @xmath76 , characterizing essentially the full two - body correlation behavior , whose main physical properties are the following :    \\i ) the figure at the left uppermost corner represents the behavior of the correlations of a two - body system . here the interaction with the impurity is turned off @xmath95 and the two majority particles interact with an increasing @xmath36 . from @xmath56 to @xmath96",
    "we observe a smooth transition from a completely homogeneous density profile , due to absence of interactions , to a curved profile with minima at the meeting point of the strongly interacting pair at @xmath92 and @xmath97 , and maximum at @xmath98 , which is the distance that the atoms prefer to achieve in order to minimize their interaction energy .",
    "\\ii ) following the uppermost row of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we observe that the two - body correlations of the majority atoms are not substantially altered by the presence of weak interaction with the impurity atom .",
    "however , when the impurity - majority interaction exceeds @xmath99 , there is a substantial change : the previously maximum at @xmath98 becomes now an additional minimum .",
    "when this minimum appears , the maxima shift to @xmath100 ( and @xmath101 ) . then due to the strong interaction with the impurity , which tends to take the position at a distance @xmath98 from the majority atoms , they in turn rearrange themselves in order to minimize the interaction energy with the impurity .",
    "this behavior can also be noted in the rest of the figures and has been already demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , while a more detailed discussion about the @xmath76 values where this smooth transition happens can be found in the appendix and the corresponding fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "\\iii ) in each figure of the second uppermost row of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we can clearly see the evolution and creation of additional minimum of the majority pair correlation as the interaction with the impurity increases . in the leftmost graph of this row the interaction between the majority atoms is zero ( @xmath56 ) and therefore we observe only the impact of the impurity . in this extreme case ,",
    "where we start directly with a homogeneous plateau , the minimum at @xmath98 appears immediately when the interaction with the impurity is switched on .",
    "it is interesting to observe the two uppermost left figures together , since they represent an opposite behavior : on the left corner , where we have two atoms interacting with no effect from the impurity , the maximum arises at @xmath98 , while on the second row , where the impurity plays the role of an indirect connection between two non - interacting atoms , exactly at @xmath98 , we have a minimum instead , and the @xmath102 positions are now preferred by the majority atoms .",
    "it is also interesting to consider the rightmost figure of this row , where we have the situation of infinite interaction or , equivalently , fermionized majority atoms ( @xmath103 ) , which is exactly the same as having two non - interaction fermions , a relevant case for the experiments .",
    "then the fermionic nature of the correlations always pinned at zero when the positions of the atoms coincide @xmath104 , but still for quite strong interaction strength with the impurity a minimum appears at @xmath98 .",
    "\\iv ) the lower two rows in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] represent the behavior of impurity - majority correlations . here",
    "we can point out the following effects : the impurity usually prefers to take a distance @xmath98 from both of the majority atoms .",
    "the leftmost and bottommost graphs represent exactly the same situation as before , i.e. , when there is effectively only two atoms interacting .",
    "this is always a homogeneous case since there is no impurity - majority interaction ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "we see that for quite large interaction strengths @xmath31 and @xmath36 , represented in the rightmost graphs of these rows , the impurity - majority correlation also acquires an additional ( but not so deep as before ) minimum at @xmath98 .",
    "as expected , in the integrable fermionized case ( black smooth thin lines in the rightmost plots ) the profile is identical for both majority - majority and majority - impurity correlations .",
    "this is of course true in general for all integrable cases , while for all non - integrable cases we have an asymmetry between the two kinds of pair correlations .",
    "we have shown how the breakdown of integrability in the fundamental one - dimensional model of bosons with contact interactions affects the stationary correlation properties of the three - body system in the repulsive regime .",
    "besides of expected symmetry breaking effects , we found pronounced additional peaks in the correlations for the non - integrable case , which can be detected by state - of - the art experiments . in principle , a system of three particles with different interaction strengths can be experimentally realized by controlling inter- and intra species , thus providing an exciting opportunity to explore and test the nature of integrability with ultracold atoms .",
    "we also presented a complete and detailed picture of the correlation functions for a large range of different interaction couplings ( depicted in figs . 3 and 4 ) .",
    "in our analysis we introduced a new ( variationally optimized ) jastrow ansatz , proposed in analogy to the laughlin ansatz .",
    "remarkably , it allows to derive explicit analytical expressions for the energies and correlations , not only for the integrable but also for the non - integrable cases , which are very accurate .",
    "our approach can be also extended to the attractive regime . in this case , however , a a different scenario emerges , with the possibility of bound states . in principle , a corresponding jastrow - type ansatz can be constructed , but then different two - body functions should be considered .",
    "our proposal can be employed to different systems , such as interacting fermions , bosons and mixtures composed of cold atoms with higher spin symmetry .",
    "in addition , it can also be adapted to handle a system of particles in a trap with different geometries , providing an alternative , efficient and much simpler way to existing methods .",
    "finally our proposal can be directly used to discuss the case of a higher number of particles , which is presently an active research topic , specially in the discussion of the transition from few to many - body physics . in this context , our variationally optimized jastrow ansatz could be particularly very useful to discuss the accuracy for higher n.    i.b .",

    "<S> prominent examples include the lieb - liniger model @xcite for spinless bosons and the yang - gaudin model @xcite for two - component fermions , or the mcguire impurity model in 1d fermi gas recently realized experimentally @xcite . in this scenario , the remarkable discovery that one - dimensional bose gas of @xmath0 do not thermalize after thousands of collisions @xcite led to a natural question : what happens when integrability is broken ? there has been a lot of activity in this direction related to the study of the quantum dynamics of integrable systems , in particular the behavior of the prototypical lieb - liniger model after a quench @xcite and a generalized gibbs ensemble has been proposed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the break of integrability has also found some implications in spin chains and transport properties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility not much explored yet is how the stationary many - body correlations are affected when the integrability is broken . </S>",
    "<S> some differences are expected since lamacraft constructed a wave - function that comprises a non - diffractive and a diffractive part @xcite to describe weak violations of integrability . </S>",
    "<S> but to which extent the correlations are affected by the violation of integrability is still an open issue .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we break the integrability of the lieb - liniger model by setting different interaction strengths between each pair of bosons and show the consequences on the correlation properties . </S>",
    "<S> we start with the integrable case and compare the main approaches of correlated many - body wave functions : the bethe ansatz , which is the exact solution for this case , and the jastrow ansatz , based on the analytical exact two - body ( pair ) function , which is proven to be a very good approach getting almost exact if treated variationally . </S>",
    "<S> the two ansatzes agree perfectly in the extreme cases of non- and infinitely strongly interacting limits , showing a small deviation for intermediate interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we then set up a jastrow ansatz for the non - integrable case of unequal interaction strengths and discuss its accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> we also explore the behavior of the variational parameter , the exponent of the pair - function in the variational jastrow ansatz , which plays a similar role as the corresponding exponent in the celebrated laughlin ansatz @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a remarkable outcome of our jastrow ansatz approach is that it allows to derive explicit analytical formulas for the energies and correlations , surprisingly not only for the integrable but also for the non - integrable case . </S>",
    "<S> we examine also the stability of the properties of the integrable case , i.e. , we analyze qualitatively and quantitatively weather they persist as we go far from integrability , showing that close to the tonks - girardeau limit @xcite the integrable behavior is more stable than for weak interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the correlation properties in terms of two - body correlation functions showing effects like symmetry breaking and pronounced additional peaks for the non - integrable case , which can be detected by state - of - the art experiments . </S>"
