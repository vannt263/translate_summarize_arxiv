[ question2 ] which compact orientable flat @xmath0-manifold @xmath6 can represent the cusp section of a single - cusped orientable hyperbolic @xmath1-manifold @xmath7 ?    once there exist such manifolds @xmath6 and @xmath7 , we say that @xmath6 _",
    "bounds @xmath7 geometrically_. in this note , we shall concentrate on question  [ question1 ] , devoted to compact geometric boundaries . the recent progress on question  [ question2 ] , that involves cusp sections ,",

    "however , this is still an open problem in dimensions @xmath8 . on the other hand , by a result of m. stover @xcite , an arithmetic orbifold in dimension @xmath9 can not have a single cusp .    in @xcite ,",
    "d. long and a. reid have shown that many closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds do not bound geometrically : a necessary condition is that the eta invariant of the 3-manifold must be an integer . the first known closed hyperbolic 3-manifold that bounds geometrically was constructed by j. ratcliffe and s. tschantz in @xcite and has volume of order @xmath10 .    then , d. long and a. reid produced in @xcite , by arithmetic techniques , infinitely many orientable hyperbolic @xmath0-manifolds @xmath11 that bound geometrically an @xmath1-manifold @xmath12 , in every dimension @xmath13 .",

    "these two compact coxeter right - angled regular polytopes exist in @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively , and the first is a facet of the second .",

    "a colouring determines a manifold covering , and the main factual observation is that a colouring of the dodecahedron @xmath22 can be enhanced in a suitable way to a colouring of the right - angled hyperbolic coxeter @xmath23-cell @xmath24 .",

    "we introduce right - angled polytopes as orbifolds , and a simple colouring technique from @xcite that produces manifold coverings of small degree .",
