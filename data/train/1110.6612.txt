    "proton - proton collisions are known to be the most elementary interactions and form the very basis of our knowledge about the nature of high energy collisions in general .",
    "physicists , by and large , hold the view quite firmly that the perturbative quantum - chromodynamics ( pqcd ) provides a general framework for the studies on high energy particle - particle collisions @xcite .",
    "obviously , the unprecedented high energies attained at large hadron collider ( lhc ) offer new windows and opportunities to test the proposed qcd dynamics with its pros and cons .",
    "naturally the normal expectations run high that the bulk properties of the collision system such as all the momentum spectra and correlations of all produced hadrons should follow the strictures of qcd . but",
    "this not definite and concretely - shaped knowledge about how this actually happens and to what extent the process could be understood in the perturbative and non - perturative domains .",
    "the issues involved here still remain , to a considerable extent , quite open @xcite,@xcite .",
    "thus , having been somewhat repulsed by the so - called standard approach , we try here to explain some crucial aspects of measured data on @xmath3 reactions at the lhc range of energies with the help of some alternative approach",
    ". our main thrust would be on the properties of time - tested familiar observables like transverse momenta spectra , rapidity distributions , the ratio - behaviours and average transverse momenta ( @xmath2 ) for the charged secondaries in high energy @xmath3 interactions .",
    "comparison with some other model would be made whenever possible .",
    "the organisation of the paper is as follows : in section 2 , we provide a brief outline of the model chosen for study . in section 3 ,",
    "the results obtained by the model - based study are presented . in section 4",
    ", we end up with a discussion on the results and the observations made in section 3 and the conclusions .",
    "this section gives a brief overview of the model - based features for the production mechanism of the secondary hadrons in nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) interaction in the context of the sequential chain model ( scm ) . according to this sequential chain model ( scm ) ,",
    "high energy hadronic interactions boil down , essentially , to the pion - pion interactions ; as the protons are conceived in this model as @xmath5  =  ( @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8 ) , where @xmath8 is a spectator particle needed for the dynamical generation of quantum numbers of the nucleons @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the production of pions in the present scheme occurs as follows : the incident energetic @xmath9-mesons in the structure of the projectile proton(nucleon ) emits a rho(@xmath10)-meson in the interacting field of the pion lying in the structure of the target proton , the @xmath10-meson then emits a @xmath9-meson and is changed into an omega(@xmath11)-meson , the @xmath11-meson then again emits a @xmath9-meson and is transformed once again into a @xmath10-meson and thus the process of production of pion - secondaries continue in the sequential chain of @xmath10-@xmath11-@xmath9 mesons .",
    "the two ends of the diagram contain the baryons exclusively @xcite-@xcite .    for @xmath12(@xmath13)or @xmath14 production",
    "the model proposes the following mechanism .",
    "one of the interacting @xmath9-mesons emits a @xmath10-mesons ; the @xmath10-mesons in its turn emits a @xmath15-meson and a @xmath9-meson .",
    "the @xmath9-meson so produced then again emits @xmath10 and @xmath15 mesons and the process continues .",
    "the @xmath15 mesons so produced now decays into either @xmath16 or @xmath14 pairs .",
    "the @xmath10-@xmath9 chain proceeds in any fenymann diagram in a line with alternate positions , pushing the @xmath15 mesons ( as producers of @xmath16 or @xmath14 pairs ) on the sides .",
    "this may appear paradoxical as the @xmath15 production cross - section is generally smaller than the @xmath17 production cross - section ; still the situation arises due to the fact that the @xmath15 resonances produced in the collision processes will quickly decay into @xmath17 pairs , for which the number of @xmath15 will be lower than that of the @xmath17 pairs .",
    "besides , as long as @xmath15 mesons remain in the virtual state , theoretically there is no problem , for @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 ) is an observed and allowed decay mode , wherein the strangeness conservation is maintained with the strange - antistrange coupled production .",
    "moreover , @xmath18 ( or @xmath20 ) coupling constant is well known and is measured by experiments with a modest degree of reliability .",
    "and we have made use of this measured coupling strength for our calculational purposes , whenever necessary .",
    "it is assumed that the @xmath16 and @xmath14 pairs are produced in equal proportions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the entire production process of kaon - antikaons is controlled jointly by the coupling constants , involving @xmath10-@xmath9-@xmath21 and @xmath15-@xmath16 or @xmath15-@xmath22 .",
    "now we describe here the baryon - antibaryon production . according to the scm mechanism",
    ", the decay of the pion secondaries produces baryon - antibaryon pairs in a sequential chain as before .",
    "the pions producing baryons - antibaryons pairs are obviously turned into the virtual states . and the proton - antiproton pairs are just a part of these secondary baryon - antibaryon pairs . in the case of baryon - antibaryon pairs",
    "it is postulated that protons - antiprotons and neutrons - antineutrons constitute the major bulk , production of the strange baryons - antibaryons are far less due to the much smaller values of the coupling constants and due to their being much heavier .",
    "the field theoretical calculations for the average multiplicities of the @xmath9 , @xmath23 and @xmath24-secondaries and for the inclusive cross - sections of those secondary particles deliver some expressions which we would pick up from @xcite-@xcite .    the inclusive cross - section of the @xmath25-meson produced in the @xmath4 collisions given by @xmath26 with @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the normalisation factor which will increase as the inelastic cross - section increases and it is different for different energy region and for various collisions , for example , @xmath29 for intersecting storage ring(isr ) energy region .",
    "the terms @xmath30 , @xmath31 in equation ( 1 ) represent the transverse momentum , feynman scaling variable respectively .",
    "moreover , by definition , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the longitudinal momentum of the particle .",
    "the @xmath34 in equation ( 2 ) is the square of the c.m . energy .",
    "@xmath35 of the expression ( 1 ) is the ` constituent rearrangement term ' arising out of the partons inside the proton which essentially provides a damping term in terms of a power - law in @xmath30 with an exponent of varying values depending on both the collision process and the specific @xmath30-range .",
    "the choice of @xmath36 would depend on the following factors : ( i ) the specificities of the interacting projectile and target , ( ii ) the particularities of the secondaries emitted from a specific hadronic or nuclear interaction and ( iii ) the magnitudes of the momentum transfers and of a phase factor ( with a maximum value of unity ) in the rearrangement process in any collision . and this is a factor for which we shall have to parameterize alongwith some physics - based points indicated earlier .",
    "the parametrization is to be done for two physical points , viz . , the amount of momentum transfer and the contributions from a phase factor arising out of the rearrangement of the constituent partons .",
    "collecting and combining all these , we proposed the relation to be given by @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the average number of participating nucleons and @xmath39 values are to be obtained phenomenologically from the fits to the data - points . in this context , the only additional physical information obtained from the observations made here is : with increase in the peripherality of the collisions the values of @xmath39 gradually grow less and less , and vise versa .",
    "similarly , for kaons of any specific variety ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath40 or @xmath41 ) we have @xmath42 with @xmath43 for isr energies and with @xmath44 and for the antiproton production in @xmath3 scattering at high energies , the derived expression for inclusive cross - section is @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the mass of the antiprotons . for ultrahigh energies",
    "now let us proceed to apply the chosen model to interpret some recent experimental results of charged hadrons production for @xmath4 collisions at different energies . here , the main observables are the inclusive cross - sections or invariant yields , rapidity distributions , ratio behaviour and the average transverse momenta",
    ".      the general form of our scm - based transverse - momentum distributions for @xmath49-type reactions can be written in the following notation : @xmath50 the value of @xmath51 , for example , can be calculated from the following relation : @xmath52 the values of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 for different energies are given in table 1 .",
