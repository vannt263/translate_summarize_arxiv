    "antiferromagnetic interactions are commonly believed to play a crucial role in the mechanism of high - temperature superconductivity in the cuprates.@xcite while the long - range nel order of the insulating parent compounds is suppressed when a small density of holes is doped into the planes , dynamic spin correlations nevertheless persist into the superconducting phase .",
    "a central debate concerns the origin of the magnetic excitations .",
    "they have been attributed both to remnants of the parent insulator due to segregation of the doped holes into `` stripes''@xcite and , alternatively , to excitations of the charge carriers across the fermi surface , with enhancements due to electronic interactions.@xcite    recent inelastic neutron scattering studies have made it clear that the magnetic excitations from various cuprate families , such as la@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath2 ( lsco)@xcite and yba@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath10 ( ybco),@xcite share similar traits .",
    "many of the observed features can be described with a phenomenological model involving a universal magnetic excitation spectrum multiplied by a spin - gap function.@xcite the onset of the spin gap below the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath11 , together with the shift in spectral weight from below to above the gap , can qualitatively reproduce the commensurate `` resonance '' peak observed in ybco  @xcite and bi@xmath8sr@xmath8cacu@xmath8o@xmath12 ( bscco),@xcite and the incommensurate resonance in lsco,@xcite when these systems go into the superconducting state .",
    "the magnitude of the spin gap is material dependent and correlated with @xmath11.@xcite given these universal trends , it is reasonable to anticipate that the electronic correlations underlying the magnetic response must be common to the various cuprate families .    the sample studied here , la@xmath0ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 [ lbco ( @xmath13 ) ] , is a compound in which superconductivity is anomalously suppressed ( @xmath14  k for our sample@xcite ) by spin and charge stripe ordering .",
    "the existence of static spin and charge stripes at temperatures below the structural transition at @xmath15  k has been confirmed by neutron,@xcite resonant soft - x - ray,@xcite and hard - x - ray@xcite diffraction measurements .",
    "further evidence of the spin order ( below 40  k ) comes from magnetization@xcite and muon spin - rotation@xcite studies . the high - energy excitation spectrum from lbco ( @xmath13 ) in the stripe ordered state has been established in our previous experiment.@xcite unlike the isostructural nickelate compound la@xmath6sr@xmath7nio@xmath2 , where spin - wave - like excitations are observed in association with diagonal stripe order,@xcite the magnetic spectrum from our sample is very similar to that observed in other high-@xmath11 cuprates,@xcite where static stripes are absent .",

    "the excitations disperse outward from the commensurate position again , but with an apparent 45@xmath16 rotation of the anisotropic intensity pattern for wave vectors in the @xmath17@xmath18 plane , compared to the pattern at energies below the saddle point .",
    "the fact that lbco ( @xmath13 ) exhibits a stripe - ordered phase makes it an exception compared to the other cuprates studied so far , in the sense that there is little ambiguity on the origin of the incommensurate magnetic response .",
    "consequently , the remarkable similarities of the magnetic excitations among these various systems suggest that stripe correlations represent a prime candidate for explaining the universal behavior . of course",
    ", if the concept of dynamic stripes is to be taken seriously , it is important to fully characterize the magnetic excitations of a system where a good case for dynamic stripes can be made .",
    "a previous study@xcite of lbco ( @xmath13 ) focused on low - energy excitations ( @xmath19  mev ) and demonstrated a continuous evolution of the magnetic correlations across @xmath20 , consistent with a transition from static to dynamic stripes .    here",
    "we present an investigation of the high - energy magnetic excitations ( up to @xmath21  mev ) in lbco ( @xmath13 ) at several different temperatures using a time - of - flight neutron spectrometer .",
    "in particular , we compare measurements at 65  k and 300  k , where there is no stripe order , with those in the ordered phase at 10  k. a thermal broadening of the momentum ( * q * ) dependence and reduction of the incommensurability is observed with increasing temperature in the low - energy part of the spectrum ( @xmath22  mev ) , consistent with previous work@xcite ; however , the excitations near and above the saddle - point energy ( @xmath4  mev ) show remarkably little change . after describing the experimental details in sec .",

    "the bright diagonal stripe of scattering in the upper - right corner of the panels for 41  mev is also attributed to phonons .    the incommensurate peaks characteristic of stripe correlations@xcite are clearly seen in the @xmath58  mev data at 10 and 65  k ;",

    ", there is very little change in the high - energy scattering ( 41 and 95 mev ) across @xmath20 . by looking at the high - energy data , it is impossible to judge whether or not stripe - order is present . admittedly , at 95 mev",
    "the shape of the magnetic scattering is limited by counting statistics ; nevertheless , it is clear that there are no dramatic changes in the intensity or general * q * dependence of the magnetic signal . even at 300  k , a temperature roughly six times the stripe - ordering temperature , the main effect at 41  mev seems to be relatively modest momentum broadening of the magnetic signal .",

    "below 20 mev , we find an initial increase in @xmath59 on losing static stripe order , and then a return to lower values at 300  k. this behavior is somewhat different from that inferred from measurements of low - energy spin excitations with a triple - axis spectrometer.@xcite there , fitting of a particular model cross section to the one - dimensional scans in * q * indicated that @xmath59 monotonically decreased with warming from the ordered state .",
    "the differences could possibly result from inadequacy of the model cross section or differing treatments of background , but we can not rule out actual differences in the data .",

    "there are two drawbacks to this method .",
    "one is that the dominant signal is due to phonons ( see fig .  1 of ref .  ) ; integration over energy should give some averaging over the phonon signals , but is not guaranteed to yield a smooth background .",
    "the second issue is the magnetic form factor , which varies with energy because @xmath79 , the component of * q * perpendicular to the cuo@xmath8 planes , is a function of the energy transfer . in dividing the form factor out of the data , we also modify the phonon contributions whose * q * dependence we are hoping will largely cancel in the integral .",
    "this correction did not seem to have much impact on the nature of the net phonon background .",
    "the second method used is to integrate signal obtained from fits to the data , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "the results for @xmath77 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "panels ( a)-(c ) show the results obtained from direct integration of the data , after subtraction of a background proportional to @xmath80 , at temperatures at 10  k , 65  k , and 300  k. one can see that the shape and size of the instantaneous structure factor does not change greatly with temperature .",

    "we should also note that the result at 10  k is incomplete in that we have not included the sharp peaks from the elastic channel in the integration ; although the relative weight in the elastic peaks is not large , their narrow @xmath67 widths would lead them to dominate the shape of @xmath77 .    .",

    "quantitatively , the half width is @xmath83",
    "if we were to assume that the spin correlations fall off exponentially in real space , then we would obtain a correlation length of @xmath84   , or approximately one cu - cu nearest - neighbor spacing .",
    "the values we obtain for @xmath85 and @xmath86 are virtually the same as those reported by hayden _",
    "et al._@xcite for lsco @xmath87 at 17  k ; the magnitude of @xmath77 is also similar .    in considering the significance of @xmath85 and its lack of temperature dependence ,",
    "it is worth noting that the shape of @xmath77 ( at least that given by the lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) is different from the lorentzian one would expect if the spatial correlations decayed exponentially . instead ,",
    "the shape is rather flat - topped . to see what may determine this shape , it is instructive to look back at fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "the limiting feature for the @xmath67 width seems to be the low - energy incommensurability that is resolvable at lower temperatures .",
    "that feature is determined by the facts that the antiferromagnetic correlations are constrained to narrow domains by the charge stripes and that the phase of the antiferromagnetic correlations must flip by @xmath88 on crossing a charge stripe .",
    "thus , the magnitude of @xmath85 , together with the large energy scale for the magnetic excitations , appear to reflect the spatial inhomogeneity of the spin and charge correlations .",
    "the present results show that the energy scale characterizing spin fluctuations in lbco ( @xmath89 ) is insensitive to the ordering of charge stripes .",
    "given that the maximum in @xmath59 is at @xmath4  mev , it is not surprising that thermal energy alone has a modest impact on the spectrum , even at 300  k. what is more important is the observation that there is no qualitative change in the magnetic spectrum due to the loss of stripe order .",
    "this is another piece of evidence that the electronic and magnetic correlations in the stripe - ordered phase are similar to those in the disordered phase .",
    "it is consistent with the idea that the disordered state consists of a stripe liquid@xcite or nematic phase.@xcite evidence for a stripe liquid phase has also been observed in layered nickelates@xcite ; the difference in cuprates is that quantum fluctuations may prevent ordering , in the absence of a crystal symmetry that removes the degeneracy between equivalent stripe orientations .    that the electronic properties of the stripe - ordered state are subtly different from those in the disordered phase has been demonstrated by a couple of recent experiments .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission and tunneling measurements@xcite indicate a d - wave - like gap similar to that found in superconducting samples .",
    "the maximum amplitude of the gap is @xmath90  mev .",
    "the gap also appears in the in - plane optical conductivity,@xcite where one sees evidence both for excitations across the gap and a collective mode . in the disordered phase ,",
    "the in - plane optical conductivity looks essentially identical to that in lsco and other superconducting cuprates of comparable hole content .",
    "a picture of alternating doped and undoped two - leg ladders , with no ordered spins in the doped ladders , is consistent with the magnetic stripe order.@xcite it was argued previously@xcite that the effective magnetic dispersion observed in the stripe - ordered phase can be understood in terms of the excitations of the ordered spin ladders with a weak effective coupling across the doped ladders ; the energy scale is set by the superexchange energy of the parent insulator ( la@xmath8cuo@xmath2 in this case).@xcite various model calculations of the excitation spectra have been based on this picture.@xcite it should be noted , however , that this is certainly an over - simplified starting point for the spin dynamics , because it ignores the spin degrees of freedom in the doped stripes . here",
    "we reconsider the nature of the dispersion .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering measurements on under - doped crystals of ybco with varying degrees of twinning indicate that the magnetic excitations above the `` resonance '' energy seem to have an isotropic dispersion and intensity , in contrast to excitations at lower energies , which do show significant orientational anisotropy.@xcite these ybco crystals do not exhibit any static stripe order ; however , the dispersions do show strong similarities to those in lbco,@xcite and it seems sensible to look for a common understanding . from the similar characters ,",
    "we infer that the magnetic excitations above 50  mev in lbco likely close to 4-fold symmetric within each cuo@xmath8 plane . such behavior would be inconsistent with the over - simplified model,@xcite but could it be compatible with a more general stripe model ?    to answer this question",

    "the impact of the doped holes becomes directly apparent at lower energies , where one observes a downward dispersion . from the evolution of the spin excitations in lbco from the spin - ordered to the disordered phase ,",
    "the lowest - energy incommensurate spin excitations must be the goldstone modes of the stripe phase .",
    "returning to the possibility that a stripe - liquid character is common to the hole - doped cuprates , we note that objections have been raised in the case of ybco .",
    "in particular , bourges _ et al._@xcite have pointed out that while a dispersion downward from the `` resonance '' energy is observed in yba@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath99 for @xmath100 , it disappears for @xmath101 . in considering this objection , it should first be noted that no measurements were presented for energies lower than 25 mev ; presumably , the magnetic signal was too weak to analyze at lower energies .",
    "next , consider our results for lbco at 65  k in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "no incommensurate features can be resolved at energies above @xmath102  mev ; the incommensurability only becomes clear at lower energies .",
    "thus , the absence of an obvious dispersive or incommensurate character at higher energies and temperatures is completely compatible with our observations in the stripe - liquid phase of lbco .",

    "this behavior is correlated with a decrease in the energy width of the drude peak found in the optical conductivity.@xcite similarly , the absence of incommensurability in the low - energy magnetic excitations at room temperature is correlated with the disappearance of the drude peak into a very broad mid - infrared continuum .",
