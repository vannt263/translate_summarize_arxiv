    "in 1964 , christenson , cronin , fitch and turlay @xcite discovered that the long - lived neutral kaon @xmath1 also decays to @xmath2 with a branching ratio of @xmath3 .",
    "this discovery established cp - violation and the fact that @xmath1 is not identical to the cp - eigenstate with cp - eigenvalue equal to @xmath4 .",
    "similarly , the short - lived neutral kaon @xmath5 is not identical to the cp - eigenstate with cp - eigenvalue equal to @xmath6 .",
    "cp violation was confirmed later by the decay @xmath7 @xcite and by the charge asymmetry @xcite in the @xmath8 decays @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , this semileptonic asymmetry measures whether cp - violation is presented in the physical eigenstates of the meson mass matrix , referred to as indirect cp violation .",
    "the present value of the world average @xcite of the charge asymmetry gives a cp - violation in the mixing @xmath10 .",
    "for the non - leptonic @xmath11 decays , the experimentally observable quantities are the ratios @xmath12 which can be rewritten in terms of cp - violating indirect @xmath13 and direct @xmath14 parameters as @xmath15 when the @xmath16 rule is used .",
    "the ratio @xmath17 can be determined by the `` method of ratio of ratios '' when comparing the @xmath18 and @xmath2 decay channels @xmath19    present results at cern @xcite and fermilab @xcite give conflicting results at the level of @xmath20 . new experiments with better sensitivity at cern , fermilab and",
    "the dedicated @xmath21-factory at frascati @xcite will push the precision to reach sensitivities better than @xmath22 .",
    "recently the first direct observation of a difference in the decay rates between particles and antiparticles has been accomplished by cp - lear experiment @xcite .",
    "they make use of flavour - tag , either @xmath23 or @xmath24 at @xmath25 , and study their time evolution in the decays to @xmath26 .",
    "one concludes that , in the @xmath27 system , indirect cp violation governed by @xmath28 plays the most prominent role .",
    "the main question is whether the origin of cp violation can be explained within the standard model or it needs physics beyond the standard model . in particular , is cp violation to be described by charged current flavour mixing of quarks ?",
    "we believe that the @xmath29 system is going to play a fundamental role in this respect and its experimental study will be the task of all big facilities in the world : b - factories , cornell , hera - b , b - tev , lhc .",
    "flavour number is not conserved by weak interactions , so in @xmath31 order @xmath32 and @xmath33 mix .",
    "the existence of decay channels leads to a non - hermitian mixing matrix @xmath34 in the @xmath35 basis .",
    "the physical eigenstates of mass and lifetime diagonalize @xmath36 as @xmath37 with the amplitude @xmath38 obtained in the weisskopf - wigner approximation .",
    "the standard model @xmath39 transition is given by the box diagram    which generates matrix elements with @xmath40 and an almost alignment of the complex values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "as a consequence , to a good approximation @xcite , the flavour mixing amplitude @xmath43 is just a pure phase !",
    "the parameter @xmath43 is phase - convention - dependent on the definition of the cp - transformed states and thus its phase is not , by itself , observable .",
    "the best prospects use then the strategy of the interplay between mixing and decay @xcite .",
    "the non - observability of the flavour mixing phase is made apparent in the cp - violating rate asymmetry , from a , in the semileptonic decay @xmath44 : @xmath45    to generate @xmath46 , one would need both @xmath47 and a misalignment such that @xmath48 .",
    "some prospects could appear for physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "the question is whether indirect cp violation and @xmath46 are equivalent .",
    "we propose to establish the concept of indirect cp violation by means of cp mixing in the physical states .",
    "we define the @xmath13-parameter @xcite as @xmath49    \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + |\\varepsilon|^2 } } ( |b_- \\rangle + \\varepsilon |b_+ \\rangle)\\\\ \\end{array }   \\right\\ } \\quad    where @xmath50 are the cp eigenstates . for a given cp - opertor , this @xmath13 is phase - convention - independent .",
    "this is seen explicity by the relation @xmath51 and the result ( 6 ) : the phase convention for @xmath35 states is irrelevant .",
    "@xmath13 involves , on the other hand , the three operators @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the matrix element @xmath54 plays the role of a reference phase , given by the flavour mixing amplitude in the @xmath53 conserving limit @xmath55    with three directions in the complex plane , those of @xmath56 , we have two phases that can become observable : one is well known @xmath57 and @xmath58 . for the @xmath30-system , with @xmath59 ,",
    "one has @xmath60 . in this limit ,",
    "@xmath61 and we observe that the ( second ) relative phase between @xmath42 and @xmath62 gives @xmath63 . is this a quantum - mechanical observable ?    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have discussed and interference experiment between the cp - eigenstates @xmath64 obtained from the time evolution of a cp - tag .",
    "the corresponding cp asymmetries to common leptonic final states @xmath65 and @xmath66 are able to separate out @xmath67 and @xmath63 .",
    "if @xmath68 denotes the time - evolved state from a cp eigenstate @xmath69 prepared at @xmath25 , one has @xmath70 - \\gamma [ b_+ ( t ) \\rightarrow l^-]}}{\\displaystyle{\\gamma [ b_+ ( t ) \\rightarrow l^+ ] + \\gamma [ b_+ ( t ) \\rightarrow l^-]}}\\\\[2ex ] = \\frac{\\displaystyle{2 re ( \\varepsilon ) } } { \\displaystyle{1 + |\\varepsilon|^2 } } [ 1 - e^{\\frac{\\delta \\gamma}{2 } t } \\cos ( \\delta m\\;t ) ] - \\frac{\\displaystyle{2 i m ( \\varepsilon ) } } { \\displaystyle{1 + |\\varepsilon|^2 } } e^{\\frac{\\delta \\gamma}{2 } t } \\sin ( \\delta m\\ ; t ) \\end{array}\\ ] ]    we conclude that @xmath63 is a physical quantity and observable iff the cp - transformation is well defined . is the cp - operator determined ? in the case of invariant theory , a symmetry transformation is well defined .",
    "otherrwise the corresponding symmetry operator is undetermined .",
    "it is possible to have a well defined cp operator even for a non invariant theory .",
    "this is the situation when the structure of the lagrangian allows the separation of a cp conserving part which includes flavour mixing , from a different interaction responsible for the cp non - invariance . in this type of models , as in superweak interaction @xcite , the invariant part of the lagrangian determines the action of the symmetry operation on the fields .",
    "the most interesting case is that of the standard model : a theory where flavour mixing and cp violation cannont be separated in that way .",
    "therefore , there is no phase choice for the cp trasformed fields which leaves the lagrangian invariant .",
    "different choices of phases , and thus of cp operator , will yield different observables : our @xmath13-parameter would not be unique .",
    "we are going to show , however , that the use of the quark mixing hierarchy ( empirically well established ) leads to a unique separation of the weak lagrangian into a cp - conserving and a cp - violating part .",
    "the cp operation is defined by the invariance of strong and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "when the mass matrices for the up @xmath71 and down @xmath72 sectors are considered , the corresponding electroweak quark fields have cp transformations which include unitary matrices @xmath21 and @xmath73 , respectively , in family space .",
    "the invariance condition on the lagrangian determines @xcite @xmath74 up to diagonal unitary phases @xmath75 in terms of the diagonalizing matrices @xmath76 for the quark fields .",
    "these diagonal phases are the ( arbitrary ) cp - phases of the physical quark fields .",
    "if the charged current lagrangian was absent , there would be no cross - talk between up and down quarks : the arbitrariness would have no physical effect and we could consider the cp operator to be determined .    on the contrary , the existence of a charged current lagrangian induces both    - flavour mixing through @xmath77    - cp violation through @xmath78    the arbitrariness of cp - phases in now relevant to induce different @xmath79-matrix .",
    "is it possible to choose @xmath80 such that @xmath81 ?",
    "if the answer is positive , we have a theory with flavour mixing @xmath82 , but cp invariance @xmath81 : a cp conserving standard model .",
    "cp violation would have to be understood from a superweak - type model .",
    "the necessary and sufficient conditions for cp invariance to be satisfield @xcite by the mass matrices @xmath83 and the corresponding phase fixing were discussed @xcite some time ago .    if there is no cp - phase choice for @xmath84 to get @xmath81 , the theory is cp - violating .",
    "can the theory still filter a well defined cp operator , at least in a perturbative sense ?",
    "we know that , in the k - system , the cp symmetry is only slightly violated and its size @xcite is of the order @xmath85 .",
    "this is understood in the standard model as a consequence of the need to involve the three families to generate cp violation .",
    "thus its effective coupling contains higher powers of the quark mixing @xmath86 than that of the cp conserving flavour mixing @xmath87 .",
    "this justifies the idea to look for a `` natural '' cp definition in the standard model based on the empirically known quark mixing hierarchy .",
    "take one of the sides ( fixed @xmath88 ) of the @xmath89 unitarity triangle .",
    "it can be decomposed in the ( complex ) plane into cp conserving and cp violating parts as @xmath90 v_{kb}^ * v_{kd } ( { { cp}\\kern-13pt\\raise+0.7ex\\hbox{{\\big{/}}}}\\;\\ ; ) = i e^{i ( \\theta_b - \\theta_d ) } i m ( e^{-i \\theta_b } v_{kb}^ * v_{kd } e^{i \\theta_d } )   \\end{array}\\ ] ]    eq ( 14 ) tells that @xmath91 defines the cp conserving direction associated to the ( @xmath92 triangle .",
    "it depends on the choice of cp - phases . however , the three cp conserving directions of the three `` down '' triangles are not independent , due to the cyclic relation    @xmath93    these cp conserving directions are attached to the triangles , so they would rotate with them under quark rephasing .",
    "they are not physical by themselves , but the relative phases between triangle sides and them are rephasing invariant .    according to the experimentally known hierarchy in the quark mixing",
    ", the magnitude of @xmath94 matrix elements can be written in terms of a perturbative parameter @xmath86 .",
    "we can estimate the relative size of every side in the three triangles of the down sector . to order @xmath95 , the two triangles ( @xmath96 ) and @xmath97 collapse to a line each , thus giving cp conservation and a natural choice for the attached cp direction : the cp invariance requirement on the effective hamiltonian fixes the corresponding cp - phases of these sectors .",
    "due to ( 15 ) the cp conserving direction for the ( @xmath92 system is already fixed .",
    "this is particularly attractive because the ( @xmath98 ) system keeps a cp violating triangle to order @xmath95 .",
    "one obtains @xcite    @xmath99    thus the cp conserving direction matches one of the sides of the ( @xmath92 triangle to @xmath100 .",
    "this result controls the value of @xmath63 for the @xmath30-system as an observable even in the standard model .    to order @xmath95 , we have    @xmath101    eq .",
    "( 17 ) proves definitively the phase - convention - independence of our analysis .",
    "these are summarized in the following two points :    \\1 ) there exists a rephasing invariant measure of cp mixing given by our @xmath13-parameter .",
    "it is independent of the rephasing of @xmath102 states and of quark fields , i.e. , independent of a specific parametrization of the mixing matrix @xmath103 .",
