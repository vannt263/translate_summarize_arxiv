    "the two - leg spin ladder is the simplest system on which cyclic exchanges can be materialized . in the absence of cyclic exchanges , with nonzero interchain couplings ,",
    "the @xmath9 spin ladder lies in a haldane phase , which has a short - range resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) ground state with a spin gap , and superconductivity emerges upon doping.@xcite contrary to the case in a @xmath9 chain , the spinons in the ladder are confined back to the well - defined quasiparticles ( massive magnons ) in the neighborhood of @xmath10 , where a spectral gap exists.@xcite it has been shown that four - spin cyclic exchanges can make the spin gap decreases rapidly.@xcite furthermore , tuning of the four - spin interactions can drive the system into different phases .",

    "<S> the temperature dependence of the specific heat and spin susceptibility of the spin ladders with cyclic four - spin interactions in the rung - singlet phase is explored by making use of the transfer - matrix renormalization group method . </S>",
    "<S> the values of spin gap are extracted from the specific heat and susceptibility , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that for different relative strength between interchain and intrachain interactions , the spin gap is approximately linear with the cyclic four - spin interaction in the region far away from the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that the dispersion for the one - triplet magnon branch can be obtained by numerically fitting on the partition function . </S>"
