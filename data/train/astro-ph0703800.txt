    "some of the flare models assign a fundamental role to the high energy particle beams in the flare energy transport . as the beams interact with the ambient plasma , their energy is dissipated and transformed mainly into the thermal energy of the transition region and chromosphere plasma .",
    "several models studied electron and proton beams as heating agents ( e.g. , @xcite ) as well as their influence on spectral line profiles ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the propagation of electron beams is inevitably connected with the so - called return current ( rc , @xcite ) which also contributes to the beam energy dissipation . besides the heating , the beams influence atomic level populations of the ambient plasma via collisional excitation and ionization .",
    "the work presented here concentrates on these two effects which are commonly neglected in the flare modeling and assesses their importance on the formation of h@xmath0 line in solar flares .",
    "the beam propagation and energy deposition is modelled by a test particle approach consistently with the hydrodynamics of the atmosphere and nlte radiative transfer in the transition region , chromosphere , and photosphere .",
    "details of the model and the methods used are described in @xcite .",
    "we study the response of quiet sun atmosphere ( val c from @xcite ) to beam pulses of short duration , 1  s with sinus - like time modulation , and power - law energy spectrum with @xmath1 .",
    "the model takes into account coulomb collisions of the beam with ambient neutrals and electrons , scattering of beam electrons , and optionally rc for the case of an electron beam ( return current is a factor of @xmath2 lower for protons carrying the same power as electrons ( @xcite ) and is neglected ) .",
    "the return current is included in a runaway approximation assuming @xmath3 , i.e.  10% of ambient electrons carry rc . for details and other approximations of rc in solar atmosphere conditions",

    "figure  [ kasparova - fig : deposit ] illustrates that proton beams deposit their energy into deeper layers than electron beams ( @xcite ) .",
    "the energy deposit of proton beams with lower value of @xmath14 peaks at higher atmospheric layers and is larger at heights above in comparison with a proton beam of @xmath5  mev .",
    "consequently , the temperature at these layers is substantially increased .",
    "the hydrogen level populations are affected also by non - thermal collisional ionization and excitation .",

    "their influence on the temporal evolution of the h@xmath0 profile was studied for electron beams by @xcite . here , we describe in detail their effect for proton beams and the influence of rc for electron beams .",
    "the temporal evolution of the h@xmath0 line - center ( @xmath15 ) and wing ( @xmath16 ) intensities are shown in fig .",
    "[ kasparova - fig : prof ] .",
    "as discussed in @xcite and @xcite for the case of electron beams , @xmath11 cause a decrease of the line - center intensity at the very start of the beam propagation and enhance the wing intensity later on ( mainly for fluxes @xmath17  erg@xmath7s@xmath8 ) .",
    "the line behaviour can be understood in terms of contribution functions @xmath12 to the outgoing intensity given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the height .",
    "figure  [ kasparova - fig : cfel ] shows the evolution of h@xmath0 @xmath12 for the case of an electron beam with rc and @xmath11 included .",
    "a decrease of the line center intensity is caused by an increase of opacity due to @xmath11 ( see @xmath12 at 0.2  s ) .",
    "later on , a new region of wing formation occurs at the layers where the energy deposit peaks ( see @xmath12 at 0.4  s ) .",
    "such a layer is not formed if @xmath11 are not considered . since rc causes heating of the top parts of the atmosphere , it is responsible for the increase of the line center intensity at 0.4  s ( see fig .  [",
    "kasparova - fig : prof ] ) forming in a narrow region at @xmath20  km ( see fig .",
    "[ kasparova - fig : cfel ] ) .",
    "the situation for a proton beam is shown in fig .",
    "[ kasparova - fig : cfproton ] . in the case of @xmath5  mev ,",
    "the beam energy is deposited in regions where the line wings are formed .",
    "if @xmath11 are included , they cause increase of opacity which leads to a drop of both the wing and the line - center intensities ( see @xmath12 at 0.2  s ) .",
    "later on , a new wing region occurs .",
    "neglecting @xmath11 , the line intensity does almost not change because the temperature structure is not significantly affected by the beam propagation .",
    "however , for a proton beam of @xmath4  mev , the temperature increase is large enough to form a new region of the line center intensity , as in the case of rc for an electron beam .",
    "also , the energy deposit is large enough to create a new layer of strong wing intensity ( see @xmath12 at 0.4 and 1.1  s and fig .",
    "[ kasparova - fig : prof ] ) .",
    "the second peak of the line center intensity at about 1.1  s is due to broadening of the formation region .",
    "similarly to the electron beams , the line wings are not changed if @xmath11 are not considered .",
    "the h@xmath0 line is influenced by temperature structure resulting from the beam propagation and return current as well as the non - thermal collisional rates .",
    "we propose to use the decrease of h@xmath0 line - center intensity as diagnostic indicating the presence of particle beams .",
