    "topological surgery is a mathematical technique used for changing the homeomorphism type of a topological manifold , thus for creating new manifolds out of known ones .",
    "more precisely , manifolds with homeomorphic boundaries may be attached together via a homeomorphism between their boundaries which can be used as ` glue ' .",
    "an _ @xmath1-dimensional topological surgery _ on an @xmath1-manifold @xmath2 is , roughly , the topological procedure whereby an appropriate @xmath1-manifold with boundary is removed from @xmath2 and is replaced by another @xmath1-manifold with the same boundary , using a ` gluing ' homeomorphism along the common boundary , thus creating a new @xmath1-manifold @xmath3 .",
    "for example , all orientable surfaces may arise from the 2-dimensional sphere using surgery .    in this paper",
    "we extend significantly the preliminary results and early ideas presented in @xcite,@xcite , @xcite and @xcite . as we observe",
    ", topological surgery is exhibited in nature in numerous , diverse processes of various scales for ensuring new results .",
    "surgery in nature is usually performed on basic manifolds with or without boundary that undergo merging and recoupling .",
    "such processes are initiated by attracting ( or repelling ) forces acting on a sphere of dimension 0 or 1 . a large part of this work is dedicated to setting the topological ground for modeling such phenomena in dimensions 1,2 and 3 .",
    "namely , we introduce new theoretical concepts which are better adapted to the phenomena and which enhance the formal definition of surgery .",
    "more precisely , the new concepts are :    @xmath4 * the introduction of forces : * a sphere of dimension 0 or 1 is selected in space and attracting ( or repelling ) forces act on it .",
    "these dynamics explain the intermediate steps of the formal definition and extend surgery to a continuous process caused by local forces .",
    "note that these intermediate steps can also be explained through morse theory .",
    "the theoretical forces that we introduce are also observed in the phenomena exhibiting surgery .",
    "for example , in dimension 1 , during chromosomal crossover ( see figure  [ chromcrossover ] ) , the pairing is caused by mutual attraction of the parts of the chromosomes that are similar or homologous . in dimension 2 , the creation of tornadoes ( see figure  [ tornado ] ( a ) ) is caused by attracting forces between the cloud and the earth while soap bubble splitting ( see figure  [ bubbles ] ) is caused by the surface tension of each bubble which acts as an attracting force .    @xmath4 * solid surgery : * the interior of the initial manifold is now filled in . for example , in dimension 1 this allows to model phenomena happening on surfaces such as the merging of oil slicks .",
    "an oil slick is seen as a disc , that is a continuum of concentric circles together with the center .",
    "an example in dimension 2 is the process of mitosis ( see figure  [ mitosis ] ) , whereby a cell splits into two new cells .",
    "the cell is seen as a 3-ball , that is , a continuum of concentric spheres together with the central point .",
    "other examples comprise the formation of waterspouts ( see figure  [ tornado ] ( b ) ) where we see the formation of the tornado s cylindrical ` cork ' and the creation of falaco solitons ( see figure  [ falaco ] ) where the creation of two discs joined with an invisible thread is taking place in a pool of water .",
    "@xmath4 * embedded surgery : * all phenomena exhibiting surgery take place in 3-space . for this reason we introduce the notion of embedded 1- or 2-dimensional surgery which is taking place on an embedding of the initial manifold in 3-space .",
    "the ambient 3-space leaves room for the initial manifold to assume a more complicated configuration and allows the complementary space of the initial manifold to participate actively in the process .",
    "for example , in dimension 1 any embedding of @xmath5 is a knot and a related phenomenon is the dna recombination of circular dna ( see figure  [ dna_recomb ] ) .",
    "an example in dimension 2 is the formation of black holes ( see figure  [ blackhole ] ) where the whole space is involved in the process .",
    "note that the appearance of forces , enhanced with the notions of solid 1- and 2-dimensional surgery , can be all viewed within the context of embedded surgery .",
    "in fact all the above culminate to the notion of embedded solid 2-dimensional surgery and can be derived from there .    @xmath4 * connection with a dynamical system : * finally , we establish a connection between these new notions applied on 2-dimensional topological surgery and the dynamical system presented in @xcite .",
    "we analyze how , with a slight perturbation of parameters , trajectories pass from spherical to toroidal shape through a ` hole drilling ' process .",
    "we show that our new topological notions are verified by both the local behavior of the steady state points of the system and the numerical simulations of its trajectories .",
    "this result give us on the one hand a mathematical model for 2-dimensional surgery and on the other hand a system that can model natural phenomena exhibiting these types of surgeries .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ intr ] we recall the topological notions that will be used and provide specific examples that will be of great help to readers that are not familiar with topological surgery . in section  [ 1d ] , we introduce dynamics to 1-dimensional surgery , we define solid 1-dimensional surgery and we discuss 1-dimensional natural processes exhibiting these types of surgeries . in section  [ 2d ]",
    "we extend these definitions to 2-dimensional surgery and discuss related 2-dimensional natural processes .",
    "we then use these new theoretical concepts in section  [ connecting ] to pin down the relations among topological surgeries of different dimensions . as all natural phenomena exhibiting surgery ( 1 or 2-dimensional , solid or usual )",
    "take place in the ambient 3-space , in section  [ s3 ] we present our 3-space @xmath0 and the duality of its descriptions .",
    "this allows us to define in section  [ es3sp ] the notion of embedded surgery in @xmath0 .",
    "finally , our connection of solid 2-dimensional surgery with a dynamical system is established in section  [ ds ] .",
    "in each dimension the basic closed ( compact without boundary ) , connected , oriented ( c.c.o . ) @xmath1-manifold , is the @xmath1-sphere , @xmath6 , which may be viewed as @xmath7 with all points at infinity compactified to one single point . for @xmath8 ,",
    "the space @xmath9 is the disjoint union of two one - point spaces @xmath10 and @xmath11 : @xmath12 .",
    "the product space @xmath13 is the disjoint union @xmath14 .",
    "we also need to recall that the basic connected , oriented @xmath1-manifold with boundary is the solid @xmath1-ball , @xmath15 . in particular for @xmath16 , other 3-manifolds with boundary , that we will be referring to ,",
    "are : the solid torus , which can be described as the product set @xmath17 , and the handlebodies , which generalize the solid torus , having higher genus .",
    "we recall the following topological notions :    1 .",

    "that is : @xmath37    note that resulting manifold @xmath3 may or may not be homeomorphic to @xmath2 . from the above definition , it follows that @xmath38 . for preliminary definitions behind the definitions of surgery such as topological spaces , homeomorphisms , embeddings and other related notions",

    "[ 1d_formale ] we only have one kind of surgery on a 1-manifold @xmath2 , the _",

    "there are two ways of reconnecting four points , both of which are illustrated in figure  [ 1d_formal ] .",
    "for example , if we start with the circle @xmath44 , depending on the type of reconnection , we obtain two circles @xmath45 if @xmath27 is the standard embedding , see figure  [ 1d_formal ] ( a ) , or one circle @xmath5 if @xmath27 is modified by twisting one of the emdeddings of @xmath46 , see figure  [ 1d_formal ] ( b ) . more specifically , if we define the homeomorphism @xmath47 , the embedding used in ( b ) is @xmath48 .",
    "note that in one dimension , the dual case is also a 1-dimensional 0-surgery .",
    "for example , as seen in both figure  [ 1d_formal ] ( a ) and ( b ) , the reverse processes are 1-dimensional 0-surgeries which give back @xmath49 . more specifically , starting with two circles @xmath50 ,",
    "if each segment of @xmath42 is embedded in a different circle , the result of 1-dimensional 0-surgery is one circle ( see the reverse process of figure  [ 1d_formal ] ( a ) ) .",
    "[ 2d_formale ] starting with a 2-manifold @xmath2 , there are two types of surgeries . for @xmath51 and @xmath8 , we have the _",
    "2-dimensional 0-surgery _ whereby two discs @xmath52 are removed from @xmath2 and are replaced in the closure of the remaining manifold by a cylinder @xmath53 , which gets attached via a homeomorphism along the common boundary @xmath54 , comprising two copies of @xmath5 .",
    "the gluing homeomorphism of the common boundary can twist one or both copies of @xmath5 . for @xmath55 , the above operation",

    "see figure  [ 2d_formal ] ( b ) .    from definition  [ surgery",
    "] , it follows that a dual 2-dimensional 0-surgery is a 2-dimensional 1-surgery and vice versa .",
    "hence , figure  [ 2d_formal ] ( a ) shows that a 2-dimensional 0-surgery on a sphere is the reverse process of a 2-dimensional 1-surgery on a torus . similarly , as illustrated in figure  [ 2d_formal ] ( b ) , a 2-dimensional 1-surgery on a sphere is the reverse process of a 2-dimensional 0-surgery on two spheres . in the figure",
    "the symbol @xmath60 depicts surgeries from left to right and their corresponding dual surgeries from right to left .",
    "1-dimensional 0-surgery happens in nature , in various scales , in phenomena where 1-dimensional splicing and reconnection occurs .",
    "for example , it happens on chromosomes during meiosis and produces new combinations of genes ( see figure  [ chromcrossover ] ) , in site - specific dna recombination ( see figure  [ dna_recomb ] ) whereby nature alters the genetic code of an organism , either by moving a block of dna to another position on the molecule or by integrating a block of alien dna into a host genome ( see @xcite ) , in magnetic reconnection , the phenomenon whereby cosmic magnetic field lines from different magnetic domains are spliced to one another , changing their patterns of connectivity with respect to the sources ( see figure  [ magneticrecon ] from @xcite ) and in the reconnection of vortices in classical and quantum fluids ( see @xcite ) .    in this section",
    "we introduce dynamics which explains the process of 1-dimensional surgery , define the notion of solid 1-dimensional surgery and examine in more details the aforementioned natural phenomena .",
    "the formal definition of 1-dimensional 0-surgery gives a static description of the initial and the final stage whereas natural phenomena exhibiting 1-dimensional 0-surgery follow a continuous process . in order to address such phenomena or to understand how 1-dimensional 0-surgery happens",
    ", we need a non - static description .",
    "furthermore , in nature , 1-dimensional 0-surgery often happens locally , on arcs or segments .",
    "that is , the initial manifold is often bigger and we remove from its interior two segments @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , we also need dynamics that act locally .    in figure  [ 1d_local ]",
    ", we introduce dynamics which explain the intermediate steps of the formal definition and extend surgery to a continuous process caused by local forces .",
    "the process starts with the two points specified on the manifold ( in red ) , on which attracting forces are applied ( in blue ) .",
    "we assume that these forces are created by an attracting center ( also in blue ) .",
    "then , the two segments @xmath41 , which are neighbourhoods of the two points , get close to one another . when the specified points ( or centers ) of two segments reach the attracting center , they touch and recoupling takes place giving rise to the two final segments @xmath42 , which split apart . as mentioned in previous section , we have two cases ( a ) and ( b ) , depending on the homemorphism @xmath27 .",
    "as mentioned in example  [ 1d_formale ] , the dual case is also a 1-dimensional 0-surgery as it removes segments @xmath42 and replace them by segments @xmath41 .",
    "this is the reverse process which starts from the end and is illustrated in figure  [ 1d_local ] as a result of the orange forces and attracting center which are applied on the ` complementary ' points .",
    "[ morse ] it is worth mentioning that the intermediate steps of surgery presented in figure  [ 1d_local ] can also be viewed in the context of morse theory @xcite . by using the local form of a morse function",
    ", we can visualize the process of surgery by varying parameter @xmath62 of equation @xmath63 .",
    "for @xmath64 it is the hyperbola shown in the second instance of figure  [ 1d_local ] where the two segments get close to one another .",
    "for @xmath65 it is the two straight lines where the reconnection takes place as shown in the third instance of figure  [ 1d_local ] while for @xmath66 it represents the hyperbola of the two final segments shown in case ( a ) of the fourth instance of figure  [ 1d_local ] .",
    "this sequence can be generalized for higher dimensional surgeries as well , however , in this paper we will not use this approach as we are focusing on the introduction of forces and of the attracting center .",
    "these local dynamics produce different manifolds depending on where the initial neighbourhoods are embedded . taking the known case of the standard embedding @xmath27 and @xmath67",
    ", we obtain @xmath45 ( for both regular and dual surgery ) , see figure  [ 1d_global ] ( a ) . furthermore , as shown in figure  [ 1d_global ] ( b ) , we also obtain @xmath45 even if the attracting center is outside @xmath5 .",
    "note that these outcomes are not different than the ones shown in formal surgery ( figure  [ 1d_formal ] ) but we can now see the intermediate instances .",
    "looking closer at the aforementioned phenomena , the described dynamics and attracting forces are present in all cases .",
    "namely , * magnetic reconnection * ( figure  [ magneticrecon ] ) corresponds to a dual 1-dimensional 0-surgery ( see figure  [ 1d_local ] ( b ) ) where @xmath68 is a dual embedding of the twisting homeomorphism @xmath69 defined in example  [ 1d_formale ] of section  [ definitions ] .",
    "the tubes are viewed as segments and correspond to an initial manifold @xmath70 ( or @xmath44 if they are connected ) on which the local dynamics act on two smaller segments @xmath61 .",
    "namely , the two magnetic flux tubes have a nonzero parallel net current through them , which leads to attraction of the tubes ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . between them , a localized diffusion region develops where magnetic field lines may decouple .",
    "reconnection is accompanied with a sudden release of energy and the magnetic field lines break and rejoin in a lower energy state .",
    "in the case of * chromosomal crossover * ( figure  [ chromcrossover ] ) , we have the same dual 1-dimensional 0-surgery as magnetic reconnection ( see figure  [ 1d_local ] ( b ) ) . during this process , the homologous ( maternal and paternal ) chromosomes come together and pair , or synapse , during prophase .",
    "the pairing is remarkably precise and is caused by mutual attraction of the parts of the chromosomes that are similar or homologous .",
    "further , each paired chromosomes divide into two chromatids .",
    "the point where two homologous non - sister chromatids touch and exchange genetic material is called chiasma . at each chiasma , two of the chromatids have become broken and then rejoined ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in this process",
    ", we consider the initial manifold to be one chromatid from each chromosome , hence the initial manifold is @xmath70 on which the local dynamics act on two smaller segments @xmath61 .",
    "for * site - specific dna recombination * ( see figure  [ dna_recomb ] ) , we have a 1-dimensional 0-surgery ( see figure  [ 1d_local ] ( b ) ) with a twisted homeomorphism @xmath69 as defined in example  [ 1d_formale ] of section  [ definitions ] . here the initial manifold is a knot which is an embedding of @xmath44 in 3-space but this will be detailed in section  [ es3sp ] . as mentioned in @xcite , enzymes break and rejoin the dna strands , hence in this case the seeming attraction of the two specified points is realized by the enzyme . note that , while both are genetic recombinations , there is a difference between chromosomal crossover and site - specific dna recombination .",
    "namely , chromosomal crossover involves the homologous recombination between two similar or identical molecules of dna and we view the process at the chromosome level regardless of the knotting of dna molecules .    finally , * vortices reconnect * following the steps of 1-dimensional 0-surgery with a standard embedding shown in figure  [ 1d_local ] ( a ) .",
    "the initial manifold is again @xmath70 .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , the interaction of the anti - parallel vortices goes from attraction before reconnection , to repulsion after reconnection .",
    "there are phenomena which undergo the process of 1-dimensional 0-surgery but happen on surfaces , such as * tension on membranes or soap films * and the * merging of oil slicks*. in order to model topologically such phenomena we introduce the notion of solid 1-dimensional 0-surgery .",
    "_ solid 1-dimensional 0-surgery on the @xmath71-disc @xmath72 _ is the topological procedure whereby a ribbon @xmath73 is being removed , such that the closure of the remaining manifold comprises two discs @xmath58 .",
    "see figure  [ 1d_formal ] where the interior is now supposed to be filled in .",
    "this process is equivalent to performing 1-dimensional 0-surgeries on the whole continuum of concentric circles included in @xmath72 .",
    "more precisely , and introducing at the same time dynamics , we define :    we start with the @xmath71-disc of radius 1 with polar layering : @xmath74 where @xmath75 the radius of a circle and @xmath76 the limit point of the circles , that is , the center of the disc .",
    "we specify colinear pairs of antipodal points , with neighbourhoods of analogous lengths , on which the same colinear attracting forces act , see figure  [ 1d_solid_type1 ] ( 1 ) where these forces and the corresponding attracting center are shown in blue .",
    "then , in ( 2 ) , antipodal segments get closer to one another or , equivalently , closer to the attracting center .",
    "note that here , the attracting center coincides with the limit point of all concentric circles , which is shown in green from instance ( 2 ) and on .",
    "then , as shown from ( 3 ) to ( 9 ) , we perform 1-dimensional 0-surgery on the whole continuum of concentric circles .",
    "the natural order of surgeries is as follows : first , the center of the segments that are closer to the center of attraction touch , see ( 4 ) .",
    "after all other points have also reached the center , see ( 5 ) , decoupling starts from the central or limit point .",
    "we define 1-dimensional 0-surgery on the limit point @xmath76 to be the two limit points of the resulting surgeries .",
    "that is , the effect of _ solid 1-dimensional 0-surgery on a point is the creation of two new points _ , see ( 6 ) .",
    "next , the other segments reconnect , from the inner , see ( 7 ) , to the outer ones , see ( 8) , until we have two copies of @xmath72 , see ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) .",
    "note that the proposed order of reconnection , from inner to outer , is the same as the one followed by skin healing , namely , the regeneration of the epidermis starts with the deepest part and then migrates upwards .",
    "the above process is the same as first removing the center @xmath76 from @xmath72 , doing the 1-dimensional 0-surgeries and then taking the closure of the resulting space .",

    "this process is the result of the orange forces and attracting center which are applied on the ` complementary ' points .",

    "@xmath91 ) to a surface ( resp . a handlebody ) of genus @xmath35 creating a surface ( resp . a handlebody ) of genus @xmath109 .",
    "solid 2-dimensional 0-surgery is often present in natural phenomena where attracting forces between two poles are present , such as the formation of tornadoes , the formation of falaco solitons , the formation of black holes , gene transfer in bacteria and drop coalescence .",
    "we shall discuss these phenomena in some detail pinning down their exhibiting of topological surgery .",
    "regarding * tornadoes * : except from their shape ( see figure  [ tornado ] ) which fits the cylinder @xmath53 that gets attached in the definition of 2-dimensional 0-surgery , the process by which they are formed also follows the dynamics introduced in section  [ solid2d ] .",
    "namely , if certain meteorological conditions are met , an attracting force between the cloud and the earth beneath is created and funnel - shaped clouds start descending toward the ground .",
    "once they reach it , they become tornadoes . in analogy to solid 2-dimensional 0-surgery , first the poles are chosen , one on the tip of the cloud and the other on the ground , and they seem to be joined through an invisible line .",
    "then , starting from the first point , the wind revolves in a helicoidal motion toward the second point , resembling ` hole drilling ' along the line until the hole is drilled .",
    "therefore , tornado formation undergoes the process of solid 2-dimensional 0-surgery with a twisted embedding , as in figure  [ 2d_local_hl_vl ] ( b ) . the initial manifold",
    "can be considered as @xmath110 , that is , one 3-ball on the cloud and one on the ground .",
    "note that in this realization of solid 2-dimensional 0-surgery , the attracting center coincides with the ground and we only see helicoidal motion in one direction .",
    "another natural phenomenon exhibiting solid 2-dimensional 0-surgery is the formation of * falaco solitons * , see figure  [ falaco ] ( for photos of pairs of falaco solitons in a swimming pool , see @xcite ) .",
    "note that the term ` falaco soliton ' appears in 2001 in @xcite .",
    "each falaco soliton consists of a pair of locally unstable but globally stabilized contra - rotating identations in the water - air discontinuity surface of a swimming pool .",
    "these pairs of singular surfaces ( poles ) are connected by means of a stabilizing thread .",
    "this thread corresponds to the ` invisible line ' mentioned in the process of tornado formation which is visible in this case .",
    "the two poles get connected and their rotation propagates below the water surface along the joining thread and the tubular neighborhood around it .",
    "this process is a solid 2-dimensional 0-surgery with a twisted embedding ( see figure  [ 2d_local_hl_vl ] ( b ) ) where the initial manifold is the water contained in the volume of the pool where the process happens , which is homeomorphic to a 3-ball , that is @xmath111 .",
    "two differences compared to tornadoes are : here the helicoidal motion is present in both poles and the attracting center is not located on the ground but between the poles , on the topological thread joining them .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the creation of falaco solitons is immediate and does not allow us to see whether the transitions of the 2-dimensional 0-surgery shown in figure  [ 2d_local_hl_vl ] ( b ) are followed or not .",
    "however , these dynamics are certainly visible during the annihilation of falaco solitons .",
    "namely , when the topological thread joining the poles is cut , the tube tears apart and slowly degenerates to the poles until they both stops spinning and vanish .",
    "therefore , the continuity of our dynamic model is clearly present during the reverse process which corresponds to a solid 2-dimensional 1-surgery on a pair of falaco solitons , that is , a solid torus @xmath104 degenerating into a still swimming pool @xmath91 .",
    "note that it is conjectured in @xcite that the coherent topological features of the falaco solitons and , by extension , the process of solid 2-dimensional 0-surgery appear in both macroscopic level ( for example in the wheeler s wormholes ) and microscopic level ( for example in the spin pairing mechanism in the microscopic fermi surface ) . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "another phenomenon undergoing solid 2-dimensional 0-surgery is the formation of a * black hole*. most black holes form from the remnants of a large star that dies in a supernova explosion and have a gravitational field so strong that not even light can escape . in the simulation of a black hole formation ( see @xcite ) , the density distribution at the core of a collapsing massive star is shown . in figure  [ blackhole ]",
    "matter performs solid 2-dimensional 0-surgery as it collapses into a black hole .",
    "matter collapses at the center of attraction of the initial manifold @xmath111 creating the singularity , that is , the center of the black hole , which is surrounded by the toroidal accretion disc ( shown in white in figure  [ blackhole ] ( c ) ) .",
    "solid 2-dimensional 0-surgery is also found in the mechanism of * gene transfer in bacteria*. see figure  [ genetransfer ] ( also , for description and instructive illustrations see @xcite ) .",
    "the donor cell produces a connecting tube called `` pilus '' which attaches to the recipient cell , brings the two cells together and transfers the donor s dna .",
    "this process is similar to the one shown in figure  [ 2d_solid_types1_2 ] ( b ) as two copies of @xmath91 merge into one , but here the attracting center is located on the recipient cell .",
    "this process is a solid 2-dimensional 0-surgery on two 3-balls @xmath110 .",
    "finally , * drop coalescence * is the merging of two dispersed drops into one .",
    "as gene transfer in bacteria , this process is also a solid 2-dimensional 0-surgery on two 3-balls @xmath110 , see figure  [ 2d_solid_types1_2 ] ( b ) .",
    "the process of drop coalescence also exhibits the forces of our model .",
    "namely , the surfaces of two drops must be in contact for coalescence to occur .",
    "this surface contact is dependent on both the van der waals attraction and the surface repulsion forces between two drops .",
    "when the van der waals forces cause rupture of the film , the two surface films are able to fuse together , an event more likely to occur in areas where the surface film is weak . the liquid inside each drop is now in direct contact , and the two drops are able to merge into one .    [ dsgenerality ] although in this section some natural processes were viewed as a solid 2-dimensional topological surgery on @xmath110 , we could also consider the initial manifold as being a 3-ball surrounding the phenomena and view it as a surgery on @xmath111 .",
    "concerning the process of tornado formation , this approach also has a physical meaning .",
    "namely , as the process is triggered by the difference in the conditions of the lower and upper atmosphere , the initial manifold can be considered as the 3-ball containing this air cycle .",
    "as already mentioned , the collapsing of the central disc of the sphere caused by the orange attracting forces in figure  [ 2d_solid_types1_2 ] ( b ) can also be caused by pulling apart the upper and lower hemispheres of the 3-ball @xmath91 , that is , the causal forces can also be repelling .",
    "for example , during fracture of metal specimens under tensile forces , solid 2-dimensional 1-surgery is caused by forces that pull apart each end of the specimen .",
    "on the other hand , in the biological process of mitosis , both attracting and repelling forces forces are present .    when the tension applied on metal specimens by tensile forces results in * necking * and then * fracture * , the process exhibits solid 2-dimensional 1-surgery .",
    "more precisely , in experiments in mechanics , tensile forces ( or loading ) are applied on a cylindrical specimen made of dactyle material ( steel , aluminium , etc . ) . up to some critical value of the force",
    "the deformation is homogeneous ( the cross - sections have the same area ) . at the critical value",
    "the deformation is localized within a very small area where the cross - section is reduced drastically , while the sections of the remaining portions increase slightly .",
    "this is the ` necking phenomenon ' .",
    "shortly after , the specimen is fractured ( view @xcite for details ) . in figure  [ necking ]",
    "are the the basic steps of the process : void formation , void coalescence ( also known as crack formation ) , crack propagation , and failure . here , the process is not as smooth as our theoretical model and the tensile forces applied on the specimen are equivalent to repelling forces .",
    "the specimen is homeomorphic to the sphere shown in figure  [ 2d_solid_types1_2 ] ( b ) hence the initial manifold is @xmath111 .",
    "solid 2-dimensional 1-surgery on @xmath111 also happens in the biological process of * mitosis * , where a cell splits into two new cells .",
    "see figure  [ mitosis ] ( for description and instructive illustrations see for example @xcite ) .",
    "we will see that both aforementioned forces are present here . during mitosis ,",
    "the chromosomes , which have already duplicated , condense and attach to fibers that pull one copy of each chromosome to opposite sides of the cell ( this pulling is equivalent to repelling forces ) .",
    "the cell pinches in the middle and then divides by cytokinesis .",
    "the structure that accomplishes cytokinesis is the contractile ring , a dynamic assembly of filaments and proteins which assembles just beneath the plasma membrane and contracts to constrict the cell into two ( this contraction is equivalent to attracting forces ) . in the end , two genetically - identical daughter cells are produced .",
    "it is worth noting that the splitting of the cell into two coincide with the fact that 2-dimensional 1-surgery on a point is the creation of two new points ( see definition  [ continuum2d ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ crossections12 ] , a 1-dimensional surgery is a cross - section of the corresponding 2-dimensional surgery which , in turn , is a crossection of the corresponding solid 2-dimensional surgery .",
    "this is true for both 1 or 0-surgeries ( see figure  [ crossections12 ] ( a ) and ( b ) respectively ) .    on the left - hand top and bottom pictures of figure  [ crossections12 ] ( a ) and ( b ) we see the initial and final stage of solid 2-dimensional surgery .",
    "taking the intersection with the boundary of the 3-ball @xmath91 we pass to the middle pictures where we see the the initial and final pictures of 2-dimensional surgery .",
    "taking finally the intersection with a meridional plane gives rise to the initial and final stages of 1-dimensional surgery ( rightmost illustrations ) .",
    "the above concerns 0-surgeries in figure  [ crossections12 ] ( a ) and 1-surgeries in figure  [ crossections12 ] ( b ) .",
    "furthermore , as seen in figure  [ crossections12_solid ] , we see the relation between solid surgeries in dimensions 2 and 1 .",
    "namely , solid 2-dimensional 0-surgery on the central point of the spherical nesting results in the central circle of the toroidal nesting .",
    "this circle has two intersecting points with the plane which are the result of solid 1-dimensional 0-surgery on the central point , see figure  [ crossections12_solid ] ( a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "both solid 2-dimensional 1-surgery and solid 1-dimensional 0-surgery on the central point creates two points , see figure  [ crossections12_solid ] ( b ) .",
    "all natural phenomena exhibiting surgery ( 1- or 2-dimensional , solid or usual ) take place in the ambient 3-space . as we will see in the next section , the ambient space can play an important role in the process of surgery . by _",
    "3-space _ we mean here the compactification of @xmath112 which is the 3-sphere @xmath0 .",
    "this choice , as opposed to @xmath112 , takes advantage of the duality of the descriptions of @xmath0 . in this section",
    "we present the three most common descriptions of @xmath0 in which this duality is apparent and which will set the ground for defining the notion of embedded surgery in @xmath0 . beyond that",
    ", we also demonstrate how the descriptions are interrelated via solid 2-dimensional 0-surgery which , due to the duality of the dimensions , takes place in both the initial 3-ball and its complement .      in dimension 3 , the simplest c.c.o .",

    "passing now to 2-dimensional surgeries , let us first note that embedded 2-dimensional surgery is often used a theoretical tool in various proofs in low dimensional topology .",
    "further , an embedding of a sphere @xmath55 in @xmath0 presents no knotting because knots require embeddings of codimension 2 .",
    "however , in this case the ambient space plays a different role .",
    "namely , embedding 2-dimension surgeries _ allows the complementary space of the initial manifold to participate actively in the process_. indeed , while some natural phenomena undergoing surgery can be viewed as ` local ' , in the sense that they can be considered independently from the surrounding space , some others are intrinsically related to the surrounding space .",
    "this relation can be both _",
    ", in the sense that the ambient space is involved in the triggering of the forces causing surgery , and _ consequential _ , in the sense that the forces causing surgery , can have an impact on the ambient space in which they take place",
    ". this will be analyzed in sections [ embedded2d0 ] and [ embedded2d1 ] .",
    "we will now get back to site - specific * dna recombination * ( see section [ 1dphenomena ] ) , in order to better define this type of surgery . as seen in this process ( recall figure  [ dna_recomb ] )",
    "the initial manifold of 1-dimensional 0-surgery can be a knot , in other words , an embedding of the circle @xmath44 in 3-space .",
    "we therefore introduce the notion of _ embedded 1-dimensional 0-surgery _ whereby the initial manifold @xmath2 is embedded in the 3-space .",
    "this notion allows the topological modeling of phenomena with more complicated initial 1-manifolds .",
    "as mentioned , for our purposes , we will consider @xmath0 as our standard 3-space .",
    "for details on the descriptions of @xmath0 , see section  [ decsr ] .",
    "since a knot is by definition an embedding of @xmath44 in @xmath0 or @xmath112 , in this case embedded 1-dimensional surgery is the so - called _ knot surgery_. it is worth mentioning that there are infinitely many knot types and that 1-dimensional surgery on a knot may change the knot type or even result in a two - component link .",
    "a good introductory book on knot theory is @xcite among many other .",
    "looking back to the process of dna recombination which exhibits embedded 1-dimensional 0-surgery , a dna knot is the self - entanglement of a single circular dna molecule . with the help of certain enzymes ,",
    "site - specific recombination can transform supercoiled circular dna into a knot or link .",
    "the first electron microscope picture of knotted dna was presented in @xcite . in this experimental study , we see how genetically engineered circular dna molecules can form dna knots and links through the action of a certain recombination enzyme . a similar picture is presented in figure  [ dna_recomb ] , where site - specific recombination of a dna molecule produces the hopf link .",
    "another theoretical example of knot surgery comprises the knot or link diagrams involved in the _ skein relations _",
    "satisfied by * knot polynomials * , such as the jones polynomial @xcite and the kauffman bracket polynomial @xcite .",
    "for example , the illustration in figure  [ skeinrelations ] represents a so - called ` conway triple ' , that is , three knot or link diagrams @xmath132,@xmath133 and @xmath134 which are identical everywhere except in the region of a crossing and the polynomials of these three links satisfy a given linear relation .",
    "in section  [ consurg ] we showed how we can pass from the two - ball description to the two - tori description of @xmath0 . although we had not yet defined it at that point , the process we described is , of course , an embedded solid 2-dimensional 0-surgery in @xmath0 on an initial manifold @xmath111 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that all natural processes undergoing embedded solid 2-dimensional 0-surgery on an initial manifold @xmath111 can be also viewed in this context .",
    "for example , if one looks at the formation of black holes and examines it as an independent event in space , this process shows a decompactified view of the passage from a two 3-ball description of @xmath0 , that is , the core of the star and the surrounding space , to a two torus description , that is , the accretion disc surrounding the black hole ( shown in white in the third instance of figure  [ blackhole ] ) and the surrounding space . in this section , we will see how some natural phenomena undergoing solid 2-dimensional 0-surgery exhibit the causal or consequential relation to the ambient space mentioned in section [ es3sp2 ] and are therefore better described by considering them as embedded in @xmath0 .",
    "for example , during the formation of * tornados * , recall figure  [ tornado ] ( a ) , the process of solid 2-dimensional 0-surgery is triggered by the difference in the conditions of the lower and upper atmosphere .",
    "although the air cycle lies in the complement space of the initial manifold @xmath110 , it is involved in the creation of funnel - shaped clouds that will join the two spherical neighborhoods ( one in the cloud and one in the ground ) .",
    "therefore _ the cause of the phenomenon extends beyond its initial manifold and surgery is the outcome of global changes_.    we will now discuss phenomena where _ the outcome of the surgery process propagates beyond the final manifold_. a first example are * waterspouts*. after their formation , the tornado s cylindrical ` cork ' , that is , the solid cylinder homeomorphic to the product set @xmath92 , has altered the whole surface of the sea ( recall figure  [ tornado ] ( b ) ) . in other words ,",
    "the spiral pattern on the water surface extends beyond the initial spherical neighborhood of the sea , which is represented by one of the two 3-balls of the initial manifold .    as another example , during the formation of * black holes *",
    ", the strong gravitational forces have altered the space surrounding the initial star and the singularity is created outside the final solid torus . in all these phenomena ,",
    "the process of surgery alters matter outside the manifold in which it occurs .",
    "in other words , the effect of the forces causing surgery propagates to the complement space , thus causing a more global change in 3-space .",
    "[ duality2d0 ] looking back at figure  [ s3andsurgery_2d0 ] , it is worth pinning down the following duality of embedded solid 2-dimensional 0-surgery for @xmath111 : the attraction of two points lying on the boundary of segment @xmath101 by the center of @xmath91 can be equivalently viewed in the complement space as the repulsion of these points by the center of @xmath116 ( that is , the point at infinity ) on the boundary of curve ( or line , if viewed in @xmath112 ) @xmath135",
    ".      we will now discuss the process of embedded solid 2-dimensional 1-surgery in @xmath0 in the same way we did for the embedded solid 2-dimensional 0-surgery in @xmath0 , recall figure  [ s3andsurgery_2d0 ] .",

    "again , this is a double surgery with one attracting center which is inside the first 3-ball ( in yellow ) and outside the second 3-ball ( in red ) .",
    "this process squeezes the central disc @xmath102 of @xmath91 while the central disc @xmath138 of @xmath116 engulfs disc @xmath102 and becomes the separating plane @xmath139 .",
    "as seen in instance ( 3 ) of figure  [ s3andsurgery_2d1 ] , the process alters the existing complement space @xmath116 to @xmath140 and creates a new space @xmath141 which can be considered as the void between @xmath136 and @xmath137 . by viewing the process in this way , we pass from a two 3-balls description of @xmath0 to another one , that is , from @xmath115 to @xmath142 .",
    "[ duality2d1 ] the duality described in 2-dimensional 0-surgery is also present in 2-dimensional 1-surgery .",
    "namely , the attracting forces from the circular boundary of the central disc @xmath102 to the center of @xmath91 can be equivalently viewed in the complement space as repelling forces from the center of @xmath116 ( that is , the point at infinity ) to the boundary of the central disc @xmath138 , which coincides with the boundary of @xmath102 .",
    "all natural phenomena undergoing embedded solid 2-dimensional 1-surgery take place in the ambient 3-space .",
    "however , we do not have many examples of such phenomena which demonstrate the causal or consequential effects discussed in section  [ es3sp2 ] . yet one could , for example , imagine taking a solid material specimen that has started necking and immerse it in some liquid until its pressure causes fracture to the specimen . in this case",
    "the complement space is the liquid and it triggers the process of surgery .    finally , the annihilation of falaco solitons is also a case of embedded solid 2-dimensional 1-surgery .",
    "the topological thread can be cut by many factors but in all cases these are related to the complement space .",
    "so far , inspired by natural processes undergoing surgery , we have extended the formal definition of topological surgery by introducing new notions such as forces , solid surgery and embedded surgery . however , in our schematic models , time and dynamics were not introduced by equations . in this section",
    "we connect topological surgery , enhanced with these notions , with a dynamical system .",
    "we will see that , with a small change in parameters , the trajectories of its solutions are performing embedded solid 2-dimensional 0-surgery .",
    "therefore , this dynamical system constitutes a specific set of equations modeling natural phenomena undergoing embedded solid 2-dimensional 0-surgery .",

    "<S> topological surgery is a mathematical technique used for creating new manifolds out of known ones . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that it occurs in natural phenomena where a sphere of dimension 0 or 1 is selected , forces are applied and the manifold in which they occur change type . </S>",
    "<S> for example , 1-dimensional surgery happens during chromosomal crossover , dna recombination and when cosmic magnetic lines reconnect , while 2-dimensional surgery happens in the formation of tornadoes , in falaco solitons , in drop coalescence , in the cell mitosis and in the formation of black holes . </S>",
    "<S> inspired by such phenomena , we introduce new theoretical concepts which enhance topological surgery with the observed forces and dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> to do this , we first extend the formal definition to a continuous process caused by local forces . </S>",
    "<S> next , for modeling phenomena which do not happen on arcs or surfaces but are 2-dimensional , or respectively 3-dimensional , we fill the interior space by defining the notion of solid topological surgery . we also introduce the notion of embedded surgery in @xmath0 for modeling phenomena which involve more intrinsically the ambient space such as the appearance of knotting and phenomena where the causes and effect of the process lies beyond the initial manifold . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we connect these new theoretical concepts with a dynamical system and present it as a model for both 2-dimensional 0-surgery and natural phenomena exhibiting it . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that through this study , topology and dynamics of many natural phenomena , as well as topological surgery itself , will be better understood . </S>"
