    "since the early times of quantum computing ( qc ) and quantum information processing ( qip ) , several proposals of implementation schemes have come from the field of quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "quite recently , see  @xcite , it has been shown that , at least in principle , _ scalable - nondeterministic _ quantum computation can be achieved by linear - optical passive ( lop ) devices , exploiting also the nonlinearity introduced by conditional measurements  @xcite .",
    "this has lead to several schemes  @xcite and experimental demonstrations  @xcite of quantum gates and circuits , which exploit different ways to encode a _ single qubit _ by a _",
    "single photon _ : the qubit basis states can be encoded by the vacuum and the one - photon fock states @xmath1 of a given mode of the quantized e.m .",

    "see  @xcite , and fundamental gates have been experimentally tested  @xcite .",
    "these works rely on _ single - photon multi - qubit _ ( spmq ) encoding schemes , namely schemes that allow to encode , say , @xmath4 qubits by a single photon , by introducing @xmath5 vacuum optical modes .",
    "the aim of the present paper is twofold : first , in  [ sec2 ] , we show that the spmq encoding stems in a natural way from simple general features of the fundamental algebraic objects associated with the description of the quantized e.m .",
    "field and of lop devices ; then , in  [ sec3 ]",
    ", we make use of this result to introduce a simple algorithmic procedure which , for any given quantum computation , allows to design the lop circuit that implements it deterministically",
    ". we also briefly discuss the issue of scalability .",
    "eventually , in  [ sec4 ] , we present some basic examples of deterministic lop circuits .",
    "in this section we introduce the algebraic formalism necessary to describe a quantum system of @xmath0 optical modes , and the lop devices acting on it ; our aim is to highlight the algebraic structure underlying the implementation of qip and qc by linear optics .",
    "we start by briefly recalling the algebraic description of the physical system of a single quantum optical mode , i.e. a vibrational mode of fixed frequency of the quantized e.m .",
    "field , that is formally equivalent to a quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "the fundamental object of this description is the _ heisenberg - weyl _",
    "algebra @xmath6 , namely the complex lie algebra with generators @xmath7 satisfying the relations : @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the lie bracket .",
    "notice that @xmath6 is a @xmath10-algebra , since it is endowed with the involution @xmath10 , namely the antilinear map determined by : @xmath11 the algebra @xmath6 admits a remarkable realization  realization which will be still denoted by @xmath6 in the following  as an algebra of operators in an infinite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath12 ( with the lie bracket realized by the commutator ) : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the hilbert space adjoint of @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the identity operator . in fact , given an orthonormal basis @xmath17 , one can define the _ annihilation operator _ @xmath15 by @xmath18 it follows that the _ creation operator _",
    "@xmath14 satisfies : @xmath19 moreover , one can define the _ number operator _",
    "@xmath20 , @xmath21 which is a positive self - adjoint operator .",

    "the infinite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath12  endowed with the orthonormal basis @xmath24 and the associated operator algebra generated by @xmath23  is called _ one - mode _ ( bosonic ) _ fock space_.    the operator realization of @xmath6 can also be introduced in a more abstract way . in fact , let @xmath15 be a linear operator in a ( complex separable ) hilbert space @xmath12 satisfying relation ( [ commutation1 ] ) .",
    "it is then possible to prove that , if , in addition , @xmath25 is an irreducible set of operators ( i.e. any non - trivial linear span which is invariant under the action of @xmath15 and @xmath14 must be dense in @xmath12 ) and a technical condition concerning the operator @xmath20 is verified @xcite , the hilbert space @xmath12 must be infinite - dimensional and the operators @xmath26 are unitarily equivalent to the standard annihilation and creation operators of the harmonic oscillator in @xmath27 ; moreover , the unitary operator that generates this unitary equivalence is uniquely defined up to an arbitrary phase factor .",
    "this is one of the formulations of the stone - von neumann theorem on canonical commutation relations @xcite @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", there is an orthonormal basis @xmath24 ( defined uniquely up to an overall phase factor ) in @xmath12 such that ( [ annihilation ] ) is satisfied ; hence , one recovers the previous definition of the operator realization of @xmath6 .",
    "+ the operators @xmath26 defined in such a abstract way play respectively the role of annihilation and creation operators of the quantized e.m . field , and @xmath28 is then the photon - number operator .",
    "+ finally , we notice that @xmath12 can be decomposed in a natural way as the direct sum of subspaces characterized by a given number of photons : @xmath29    this formalism can be extended to the general case of @xmath0 optical modes .",

    "on the other hand , when dealing with quantum optical systems one works with the _ infinite - dimensional _ fock space .",
    "nevertheless , we will show that by means of the jordan - schwinger ( j - s ) map , one can single out in a natural way suitable _ finite - dimensional _ subspaces that allow to encode qudits and to represent the appropriate class of transformations that allow to move within these subspaces , namely to represent the action of quantum logic gates .",

    "the previous observations are the basis of the spmq encoding and of the use of lop transformation for the implementation of logic gates .",
    "we will now move to the description of the class of optical transformations which enable to implement the _ elaboration _ of quantum information , namely logic gates on qu@xmath0its .",

    "hence , with any lop transformation it can be naturally associated a _ unitary matrix _ @xmath120 ; conversely , any unitary matrix defines a lop transformation .",
    "thus , there is a one - to - one correspondence between lop @xmath115-ports and the elements of the group u(@xmath0 ) .    on the other hand , formula ( [ matricetrasf ] )",
    "implies that any invariant linear span for the operators @xmath43 must be invariant for the operators @xmath42 as well , and this in turn means that the output field operators @xmath43 form another irreducible set .",
    "thus , as we have already pointed out in  [ sec2.1 ] , by the stone - von neumann theorem they must be unitarily equivalent to the operators @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath123 where @xmath44 is a unitary operator in @xmath45 uniquely defined up to an arbitrary phase factor .",
    "observe that , as a consequence of the photon - number conservation , the subspaces @xmath124 of @xmath45 are invariant subspaces for the operator @xmath44 .",

    "the encoding of ( quantum ) information is generally made possible by a more or less strict correspondence between the mathematical properties of the symbols that are chosen to represent the information , and those of the description of the physical system that is chosen to encode symbols .",
    "the case of the spmq encoding is special from this point of view , since such a correspondence is indeed a complete equivalence in this case .",
    "+ as we have already said , symbols in quantum information are represented by qu@xmath0its ; universal quantum computation can be done on strings of qubits in the common case of the binary coding .",
    "it is useful to recall the following abstract definitions :    * a _ qunit _ is a vector in a @xmath0-dimensional abstract hilbert space , endowed with the fundamental representation of u(@xmath0 ) acting on it ; * a _ string of k qubits _ , or _",

    "i.e. the states of a string of k abstract qubits  and the _ physical states _ ",
    "i.e. the states of the quantum system of a single photon over @xmath175 modes .",
    "the correspondence between logical and physical states can be formulated explicitly , using te well known computational basis notation : if we denote by @xmath177 the states of a given basis of the k logical qubits , we can rewrite them as column vectors with @xmath175 elements , that are all zero except for a 1 in the @xmath178-th position , with @xmath179 .",
    "then , the spmq scheme consists in encoding the logical state @xmath180 by the state of one photon in the @xmath178-th mode , with @xmath179 , and the corresponding notation is : @xmath181      we now claim that with this encoding scheme , lop devices are sufficient to implement deterministically any quantum circuit , without the need for ancillary resources and postselection schemes  @xcite .",
    "as we have previously shown , with any lop @xmath115-port one can associate a matrix in u(@xmath0 ) acting on the input modes @xmath182 , or equivalently a unitary operator @xmath44 acting by similarity : @xmath183 . from the physical point of view , this is nothing but the action of the time evolution operator associated with the @xmath115-port ( regarded as a quantum device ) on the input field operators in the heisenberg picture. + on the other hand , as far as applications to qip and qc are concerned , since the encoding resource is given by the state vectors of the fock space , it is convenient to switch to the schr'odinger picture and to represent the action of the lop devices ( regarded as quantum logic gates ) as the action of the associated unitary operators on the state vectors .",
    "the operator @xmath44 can be represented by an infinite unitary matrix , after choosing a labeling of the fock states ; now we are interested in the action of @xmath44 on the subspace @xmath100 , and , as shown in ( [ primoblocco ] ) , this is represented by a u(@xmath0 ) matrix @xmath138 wich coincides with @xmath120 . since we know",
    "that any u(@xmath0 ) matrix @xmath120 corresponds to a lop @xmath115-port built from an array of bs and ps  @xcite , this means that we can act on @xmath100 with any desired unitary transformation , and so we can do any quantum computation on a string of a fixed number of qubits .",
    "+ to make the last statement more precise , once again we refer to the computational basis notation : recall that any logical quantum circuit acting on input strings of @xmath4 logical qubits is represented by some unitary operator @xmath184 acting on the @xmath4-qubit hilbert space .",
    "after chosing a basis @xmath177 for the logical states , the operator @xmath184 associated with the circuit can be represented by a @xmath185 unitary matrix on such a basis : @xmath186 this is the _ computational basis matrix _ of the quantum circuit .",
    "+ then , when using the spmq encoding , in order to design the lop circuit which implements a given @xmath4-qubit quantum circuit , one just needs to follow three simple steps :    1 .",
    "write down the computational basis matrix of the logical circuit ; 2 .",
    "take the @xmath187 as the matrix elements of the @xmath188 matrix of a lop circuit ; 3 .",
    "apply the rzbb procedure @xcite to decompose the @xmath120 matrix in the corresponding array of ps s and bs s .",
    "this simple , constructive procedure for designing lop quantum circuits constitutes the demonstration of the claim we made at the beginning of this section .    to conclude ,",
    "notice that the simplicity of the procedure we presented makes it suitable for translation into an algorithm that could be run by a classical computer ; furthermore , if bs and ps with variable parameters were available , being their maximum number fixed by the number of modes @xmath0 , lop components could be rearranged automathically in the appropriate configuration , thus making the design of lop quantum circuit a comletely authomatized process .",
    "lop circuits for deterministic quantum computation can be designed when encoding strings of qubits by single photon multimode states ; but there are two practical problems related to this scheme .    1",
    ".   the first one is the fact that , in order to encode a @xmath4-qubit state , we need @xmath175 optical modes , which means that an exponential amount of physical resource is required ; this limits the practical feasibility of circuits acting on an arbitrary number of qubits .",
    "2 .   on the other hand , this scheme is deterministic only for computations executed on a fixed number of qubits : when coupling two registers , physical states of 2 photons will appear , which do not encode any logical state .",
    "consider two strings of @xmath189 and @xmath190 qubits ; these are encoded respectively on the spaces @xmath191 and @xmath192 , where @xmath193 .",
    "the resulting physical system after a generic lop is the system of two photons on @xmath194 modes , whose hilbert space @xmath195 is strictly larger than the encoding space @xmath196 .    at present stage",
    "it is not clear yet what the architecture of a quantum computer will be , but it seems reasonable that it will be a hybrid object made out of different components ; in this regard , scalability is only one of the requirements to be satisfied , and it should not be considered so stringent as to rule out a proposal for the implementation . with the scheme we presented here , one can build circuits acting on a small number , e.g. 2 or 3 , of qubits , which allow to test experimentally with present technology some interesting qip protocols , as we show in the next section . as a further remark",
    ", we just point out a possible way to reduce the number @xmath0 of optical modes necessary to encode @xmath4-qubit logical states , in such a way that @xmath0 is polynomial in @xmath4 .",

    ", we write down explicitly the linear map that encodes logical 2-qubit states by single - photon 4-mode states , namely on @xmath198 : @xmath199 where , following the conventional notation for @xmath4-qubit states , in the central column we have introduced the binary form of the logical state ; we will always use this notation in what follows .",
    "the first lop circuit we present is a very simple one , implementing a cnot gate .",
    "this is a 2-qubit universal gate , i.e. it can be shown that the cnot and arbitrary 1-qubit gates are sufficient to build any quantum logic network .",

    "bell states are defined as the four maximally entangled states of a 2-qubit system ; within the scheme of qc they can be produced by means of a circuit composed by a cnot preceeded by a hadamard gate on the control qubit : this maps the logical computational basis states onto the bell states : @xmath212 by a simple calculation one finds that it is represented by the followng matrix : @xmath213 where @xmath214 denotes the hadamard gate , and index 1 refers to the fact that it acts on the first ( control ) qubit .",
