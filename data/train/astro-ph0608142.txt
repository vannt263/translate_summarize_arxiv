    "the discovery of the large debris disk around @xmath1 pic @xcite and other young stellar sources with disks @xcite , plus the subsequent discovery of numerous extra - solar planets ( esp ) has led to a resurgence in the study of planet and solar system formation .",
    "discoveries of esps have been dominated by radial velocity surveys @xcite . currently , there are over 170 known esps orbiting around over 150 host stars .",
    "photometric transit surveys have identified about 10 new planets , starting with : the confirmation of the first system , hd 209458b @xcite , followed by several discovered with the ogle project and confirmed with radial velocity follow - up @xcite , to the discovery of tres  1 @xcite , the detection of the transits from the radial - velocity discovered hd  189733 @xcite , and the recent discovery and follow - up of xo-1b @xcite .",
    "these planets typically have periods less than 4 days , orbital distance @xmath20.05 au , and jupiter - like masses and radii , and hence have been called the _ hot - jupiters_. additionally , several very short period ( p @xmath3 1.5 d ) systems have been discovered @xcite and termed _ very - hot - jupiters_.    radial velocity ( rv ) surveys measure the doppler velocity of individual stars at many different times , which is a very time consuming procedure .",
    "the photometric transit method can measure thousands of stars simultaneously .",
    "in addition to monitoring a large number of stars , photometric transit detections provide information on the planet s radius and inclination , not readily available from rv surveys .",
    "it is currently not know what fraction of stars contain planets .",
    "the fraction of planets that may be hot - jupiters is also not known .",
    "about 20% of the currently known esps have periods less than 10 days @xcite and @xmath010 - 15% of solar - type stars surveyed have esps @xcite .",
    "there have been several attempts to better define what percentage of stars have planets .",
    "these range from 1 - 2% @xcite to 20% @xcite , but the latter also speculate this may be a lower limit .",
    "the large number of stars covered by photometric transit surveys should provide better constraints on the fraction of stars with hot - jupiters , and may shed light on their formation mechanisms .    here",
    "we present results from one such photometric transit survey , called wasp ( the wide angle search for planets ) .",
    "wasp consists of 2 separate telescopes , called superwasp north ( sw - n ) and superwasp south ( sw - s ) .",
    "the superwasp telescopes were designed to cover a large field - of - view with better than 1% photometric accuracy down to 12th magnitude .",
    "each sw telescope consists of 8 separate cameras , each of which covers 61 sq degrees of sky , and the combined system surveys nearly 500 sq degrees .",
    "the results presented here are from the 2004 sw - n observing campaign taken with a 5 camera configuration",
    ". a description of the sw instruments and observing strategy are presented in   2 . in  3 we present the data reduction and analysis techniques for the esp search .",
    "candidates with secure low amplitude variability that may be esps are presented in   4 . in   5 , we discuss possible false alarms , expected fraction of recovered transits , and indications for the frequency of hot - jupiters , their properties and observing follow - up strategies to confirm the transits planetary nature .",
    "lastly , in   6 we summarize our findings .",
    "the superwasp ( sw ) telescopes were designed to cover a large area of sky and achieve photometric accuracy of a few millimags , and improve on the success of the prototype wasp0 instrument @xcite .",
    "n in la palma is contained in its own custom enclosure with a hydraulically operated roll - away roof , and its own gps and weather station @xcite .",
    "the telescope mount is a rapid slew fork mount ( @xmath010@xmath4/sec ) from omi , inc .",
    "commercially available components were used where available to keep costs down and decrease construction time .",
    "these components include : the telescope control system ( tcs ) , a dedicated pc for each camera for data acquisition , and a pc attached to a tape ( dlt ) autoloader for data storage .",
    "the tcs monitors the weather , sets time for the fits data header from the gps and can close the roof in the event of a weather alert @xcite .",
    "all major components are run with linux os .    to meet the science requirements of covering a large area of sky with high photometric precision , a combination of canon 200-mm f/1.8 lenses and andor e2v 2k@xmath52k back illuminated ccds was chosen .",
    "the ccds are passively cooled with a pelletier cooler and have a very short 4-sec readout time .",
    "this combination of lens and camera gives a field of 7.8@xmath6 @xmath5 7.8@xmath6 ( @xmath261 sq degrees ) .",
    "no additional filters were used and this  wide - v  set - up covers from 815 magnitude for a typical 30 second exposure . a @xmath31% photometric precision was obtained for magnitudes brighter than v=12.5 .",
    "additional details of the superwasp project and instrumentation is presented in @xcite .",
    "sw - n was commissioned in november 2003 , and inaugurated on 16 april 2004 .",
    "our initial observing strategy was tailored toward searching for extra - solar planet transits .",
    "this was to observe fields with a large number of stars , but to avoid the galactic plane where over - crowded fields would increase the number of blended stars and make detection and data reduction difficult .",
    "based on the besancon galactic model @xcite a declination of + 28 was chosen , with the telescope stepping through ra in 1 hour increments centered on the current lst , but within the @xmath74.5 hr hour angle limit of the mount .",
    "a maximum of 8 fields were observed with a duration of @xmath01 minute per field , including a 30 second exposure , 4 second read - out and the time for the telescope to slew and settle at the new field .",
    "such observations provide well sampled light curves with a cadence of better than 8 minutes between subsequent measurements .",
    "this observing strategy provides a nightly baseline of over 6 hours of coverage for the 6 fields centered near lst at midnight , and over 4 hrs of coverage on @xmath010 fields per night .",
    "a typical field contains @xmath220,000 stars per camera at magnitudes brighter than 13 .",
    "nightly calibrations , such as bias levels , darks , and flat fields to remove the pixel - to - pixel variations and vignetting were obtained using automated scripts .",
    "biases and flat fields were obtained at the beginning and end of each night , and flat fields were taken during twilight with the telescope pointed at zenith and the drive off .",
    "exposure times were initially based on the data in @xcite and adjusted from the counts in the first image .",
    "the @xmath0 150 nights from the 2004 observing season covered several dozen separate fields and resulted in the detection of slightly more than 6.7 million stars . for the extra - solar planet search these observations were separated into 6 equal sections of the sky , each containing about 1 million stars .",
    "this work presents the stars from 23hr @xmath3 ra @xmath3 03hr , and contains nearly 900,000 stars observed for at least 25 nights and @xmath0400 image frames .",
    "the statistics for the observed fields are presented in table  1 , and the distribution of all stars in our sample as a function of sw - n v magnitude is shown in figure  1 .",
    "approximately 400,000 stars are brighter than 13.5 magnitude .",
