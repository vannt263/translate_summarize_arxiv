    "the advent of the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ and the egret instrument on board has led to the spectacular discovery of intense high energy @xmath6-ray radiation from as many as @xmath765 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in the 0.1 to 10 gev energy range ( hartman et al .",
    "the recorded sources belong mainly to the blazar class , i.e.  bl lac objects , optically violent variables ( ovvs ) , and highly polarized quasars , all radio - loud sources which show variability on short time scales in most of the observed frequency bands .",
    "the power emitted in @xmath6-radiation frequently dominates the power radiated by the source ( see e.g.  the spectral energy distributions shown by fossati et al .",
    "it is widely believed , that the non - thermal @xmath6-ray emission is produced in a relativistic jet by a population of electrons , emitting synchrotron radiation at longer wavelengths and @xmath6-rays in inverse compton ( ic ) processes of the highest energy electrons with lower energy seed photons ( see for recent reviews coppi @xcite ; sikora @xcite ; ulrich et al .",
    "the origin of the ic seed photons has not yet been established , debated possibilities include a target photon population dominated by lower energy synchrotron photons ( the synchrotron self compton mechanism , see e.g.   bloom & marscher @xcite ; ghisellini et al .",
    "@xcite ; mastichiadis & kirk @xcite ) , or dominated by external photons , e.g.  by radiation from the nuclear continuum scattered or reprocessed in the broad - line regions ( sikora , begelmann & rees @xcite ; blandford & levinson @xcite ) , or by accretion disc photons ( dermer & schlickeiser @xcite ) .",
    "although these possibilities have been studied in great detail , models where hadrons are the particles primarily accelerated ( see e.g.  mannheim et al .",
    "@xcite ) can not be ruled out yet .",
    "clearly , the study of the emission process could yield crucial clues regarding the structure of the jets leading ultimately to an understanding of the mechanisms of energy extraction operating in the surrounding of the central supermassive object .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the 1997 and 1998 observations of the bl lac object mkn 421 ( redshift @xmath8= 0.031 ) with the iact system of hegra ( daum et al .",
    "the system provides an energy threshold of 500 gev , an angular resolution of 0.1@xmath0 and an energy resolution of 20% for individual photons , and an energy flux sensitivity @xmath1f@xmath2 at 1 tev of 10@xmath3 @xmath9 ( s /",
    "n = 5@xmath5 ) for one hour of observation time .",
    "it has been used to monitor mkn 421 on a regular basis ever since its commissioning in fall 1996 to gain detailed temporal and spectral information .",
    "tev observations yield information about the emitting particles with very high energies , complementary to the information from longer wavelengths . due to the extreme conditions needed for the production of tev photons",
    ", tev blazars could be extremely revealing laboratories for the understanding of these sources in general .",
    "it should be pointed out , that the tev radiation is expected to be partially absorbed by the diffuse extragalactic background radiation ( debra ) ( e.g.  gould & schrder @xcite ; stecker , de jager & salomon @xcite ) . while on the one hand the debra extinction opens unique possibilities to infer information about the debra density in the largely unconstrained 0.5 to 100  @xmath10 m wavelength region ( see aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite , called _ paper 2 _ in the following ) , on the other hand it renders the understanding of the source more difficult ( e.g. coppi & aharonian @xcite ; bednarek & protheroe @xcite ) .",
    "the bl lac mkn 421 was the first extragalactic object to be discovered as a tev emitter ( punch et al .",
    "@xcite ; petry et al .",
    "the early hegra observations during the 1994/1995 observation period showed , that the spectrum of mkn 421 was significantly softer than the crab spectrum ( petry et al .",
    "@xcite ) . while the mean tev flux level of mkn 421 is about 0.5 crab units ( petry et al .",
    "@xcite ) , flares exceeding five crab units on timescales as short as 15 minutes have been observed ( gaidos et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    the second bl lac object to be discovered as tev source ( quinn et al .",
    "@xcite ; bradbury et al .",
    "@xcite ) , mkn 501 ( redshift @xmath8= 0.034 ) , underwent a major outburst in x - ray and in the tev energy range during 1997 ( see e.g.  protheroe et al .",
    "detailed accounts of the results obtained with the hegra iacts are given in ( aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite , called _ paper 1 _ in the following ) , paper 2 , and in ( aharonian et al .",
    "the source emission showed strong variability with differential fluxes at 1  tev from a fraction to 10 times the crab flux .",
    "the hegra iact system was used to determine diurnal differential spectra for more than 60 individual days .",
    "surprisingly no correlation between absolute flux and spectral shape was found .",
    "the differential time averaged photon spectrum was well described by a power law with an exponential cutoff @xmath11n/@xmath11e @xmath12 up to energies of @xmath7 20 tev . due to the similarity in redshifts of mkn 421 and",
    "mkn 501 ( @xmath8 = 0.031 and 0.034 respectively ) the intergalactic extinction of the tev photons caused by the debra should be very similar for both objects and a comparison of both spectra is of utmost interest .",

    "[ hegra ] the iact system of hegra is introduced , and in sect .",

    "the hegra collaboration operates six imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes located on the roque de los muchachos on the canary island of la palma , at 2200  m above sea level .",
    "a prototype telescope ( ct1 ) started operation in 1992 and has undergone significant hardware upgrades since then ( mirzoyan et al .",
    "@xcite ; rauterberg et al .",
    "@xcite ) . this telescope continues to operate as an independent instrument and the mkn 421 data taken with this telescope will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the stereoscopic system of cherenkov telescopes consists of five telescopes ( ct2 - ct6 ) , and has been taking data since 1996 , initially with three and four telescopes , and since fall 1998 as a complete five - telescope system .",
    "four of the telescopes ( ct2 , ct4 , ct5 , ct6 ) are arranged in the corners of a square with roughly 100 m side length , and one telescope ( ct3 ) is located in the center of the square . during 1997 and 1998 ,",
    "when the data discussed in this paper were taken , ct2 was still used as stand alone detector .",
    "the telescopes have an 8.5 m@xmath13 tessellated reflector , focusing the cherenkov light onto a camera with 271 photomultipliers ( pmts ) , covering a field of view of @xmath14 in diameter .",
    "a telescope is triggered when the signal in at least two adjacent pmts exceeds an amplitude of 10 ( before june 1997 ) or 8 ( after june 1997 ) photoelectrons ; in order to trigger the iact system and to initiate the readout of data , at least two telescopes have to trigger simultaneously .",
    "typical trigger rates are in the 10 - 16 hz range .",
    "the pmt signals are digitized and recorded by 120 mhz flash - adcs .",
    "the telescope hardware is described by hermann ( @xcite ) ; the trigger system and its performance are reviewed by bulian et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ; the calibration of the detector sensitivity is described in ( fra et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and the determination of the correct telescope pointing with 35 arc sec accuracy is described in ( phlhofer et al .",
    "the analysis described in the following is based on 165 hours of data acquired between january 1st , 1997 and may 27th , 1998 with mkn 421 altitudes larger than 45@xmath0 above the horizon . only data taken with all four iacts during excellent weather conditions ,",
    "i.e.   clear sky and humidity below 90% , have been used .",
    "furthermore , data runs with a mean cosmic ray rate deviating by more than 21% from the expected value or with a mean width parameter per telescope deviating by more than 6% from the expected value were excluded from the analysis .",
    "the monte carlo simulations used for the data analysis are described in detail in ( hemberger @xcite ; konopelko et al .",
    "changes of the trigger conditions , the mirror alignment and reflectivities as well as in the pm sensitivities divide the data sample in eight phases of approximately uniform detector performance . for each of these eight phases ,",
    "the detector simulations have been adjusted to describe as closely as possible the hardware performance ; hereby , information about the mirror alignment from point runs , information about the mirror reflectivities and photomultiplier sensitivities from the measured cosmic ray rates , and the measured single pixel trigger characteristics have been taken into account ( see paper 1 , 2 and references therein ) .",
    "the monte carlo fine tuning and the data quality have intensively been tested using data from mkn 501 , mkn 421 , and from the crab nebula , allowing to effectively test all response functions relevant for the determination of @xmath6-ray fluxes and @xmath6-ray energy spectra ( see paper 1 & 2 , and hofmann @xcite ) .",
    "the current status of the crab analysis with the hegra telescope system is described in ( konopelko et al .",
    "the standard analysis methods described in detail in paper 1 and 2 have been used .",
    "thus , spectral studies have been performed with loose selection cuts , i.e.  with a cut on the angular distance @xmath15 of the reconstructed direction from the mkn 421 direction @xmath16 and a cut on the parameter `` mean scaled width '' with a cut value of 1.2 .",
    "loose cuts do not give an optimal signal to noise ratio but guarantee small systematic errors on the energy dependent cut efficiencies .",
    "the analysis uses an extended off - region for minimizing the statistical errors of the background estimate . a ring segment ( of 180@xmath0 opening angle ) , from 0.3@xmath0 to 0.7@xmath0 distance from the camera center , at the opposite side of the on - region , has been chosen .",
    "the energy reconstruction required two iacts within 200 m from the shower axis , each with more than 40 photoelectrons per image and a `` distance '' parameter of smaller than 1.7@xmath0 .",
    "additionally , a minimal stereo angle larger than 20@xmath0 was required .",
    "the methods for reconstructing the @xmath6-ray energy spectra , as well as the description of the main sources of systematic uncertainties have been discussed in detail in paper 1 and 2 .",
    "the systematic errors can be divided into two parts , into an error on the absolute energy scale , and into additional errors on the shape of the spectrum ( see paper 2 ) .",
    "the error on the absolute energy scale amounts to 15% and is dominated by a 10% uncertainty of the detector sensitivity .",
    "additional uncertainties arise mainly due to the incomplete knowledge of the atmospheric conditions during the observations .",
    "the error on the shape of the spectrum is considerable in the threshold energy region , i.e. at energies below 1 tev .",
    "the error is dominated by uncertainties in the trigger behavior of the iacts and by uncertainties of the reconstruction of @xmath6-ray energy spectra based on monte carlo simulations at discrete zenith angles .",
    "integral fluxes above a certain energy threshold are obtained by integrating the differential energy spectra above the threshold energy , rather than by simply scaling detection rates . by this",
    "means the integral fluxes can be computed without assuming a certain source energy spectrum .    for the data up to zenith angles of 30@xmath0 , comprising altogether 126 h of data",
    ", spectral results are presented for energies above 500 gev ; for the 39  h of data with zenith angles between 30@xmath0 and 45@xmath0 , an energy threshold of 1 tev has been chosen .",

    "the @xmath20-value of the fit , computed with the statistical errors only , is 23.5 for 10 degrees of freedom , corresponding to a chance probability for larger @xmath20-values of 1% .",
    "taking into account the systematic errors on the shape of the spectrum , the result is surely compatible with a pure power law spectrum .",
