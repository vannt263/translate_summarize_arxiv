    "a basic problem of @xmath0-manifold topology is to find all exotic copies of smooth @xmath0-manifolds , in particular to find various methods of constructing different smooth structures on @xmath0-manifolds ( e.g.   logarithmic transform @xcite , fintushel - stern s rational blowdown  @xcite and knot surgery  @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to approach this problem by corks and give applications . since different smooth structures on a @xmath0-manifold",
    "can be explained by existence corks which divide the manifold into two stein pieces @xcite , cork twisting stein manifolds is a central theme of this paper .",
    "the first cork was introduced in  @xcite , and was used in @xcite to construct a pair of two simply connected compact @xmath0-manifolds with boundary and second betti number @xmath8 which are homeomorphic but non - diffeomorphic .",
    "later it turned out that cork twists easily give many such pairs ( akbulut - matveyev  @xcite , the authors  @xcite ) , where each pair consists of a stein @xmath0-manifold and a non - stein @xmath0-manifold , hence they are not diffeomorphic .",

    ". moreover , the induced contact structures on their boundary are mutually isomorphic . though these 4-manifolds have large second betti number , later in  @xcite for each @xmath2 , by using corks , the authors constructed pairs of simply connected compact stein @xmath0-manifolds which are homeomorphic but non - diffeomorphic .    in this paper , by using properties of stein @xmath0-manifolds we extend the previous simple cork constructions to an explicit algorithm . here ( @xmath0-dimentional oriented ) _ @xmath14-handlebody _ means a compact , connected , oriented smooth @xmath0-manifold obtained from the @xmath0-ball by attaching @xmath15- and @xmath14-handles .",
    "the algorithm goes roughly as follows : take any @xmath14-handlebody with @xmath2 , then change the handle diagram into a certain form and add appropriate corks to produce compact stein 4-manifolds ; then by twisting these corks detect the change of smooth structures by the adjunction inequalities .",
    "this construction generalizes the carving technique of @xcite .",
    "this process here gives arbitrary many mutually homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic compact stein 4-manifolds which have the same topological invariants as the given 2-handlebody ( see theorems  [ sec : algorithm1:main theorem ] and  [ sec : variant : main theorem ] , for details ) .",
