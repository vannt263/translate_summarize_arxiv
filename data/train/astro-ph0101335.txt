    "absorption features in quasar spectra represent a powerful tool to investigate the formation and evolution of gaseous structures in the early universe ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , the efficiency of processes such as merging @xcite , gas depletion due to star formation @xcite , and ionization by the ultraviolet background radiation field @xcite . also the level of cloud clustering may be investigated analyzing absorption spectra @xcite .",
    "lyman - limit absorption systems ( hereafter lls ) are cosmological structures which contain enough neutral hydrogen to absorb lyman continuum photons and produce a break in the qso continuum flux level .",
    "this feature is detectable in moderate - resolution spectra whenever the opacity to lyman continuum photons satisfies the condition @xmath2 , equivalent to a neutral hydrogen column density @xmath3 .",
    "the column density of lls can be determined whenever a residual flux beyond the lyman break is detectable .",
    "systems with @xmath4 are also visible in moderate - resolution spectra since they give rise to damped lyman-@xmath0 absorption lines with a reference frame equivalent width @xmath5 . in this paper",
    "we shall refer to these as damped lyman-@xmath0 absorption systems ( hereafter dls ) .",
    "the  column density of absorbers is usually very poorly determined observationally when @xmath6 since the lyman break is saturated , while the lyman-@xmath0 absorption line is not yet damped .",
    "previous studies of absorbers with poorly determined column densities have been carried out using a coarse binning in @xmath7 . but a coarse binning suffers by statistical problems , related to the fact that different choices of binning may lead to different results ( e.g.  @xcite for problems related to redshift binning ) , as well as by some negative consequences on the physical description , because it does not differentiate  column densities which correspond to different ionization conditions .",
    "this is particularly important for @xmath8 since in this range a smoothly varying total gas column density distribution leads to a rapidly varying  column density distribution due to the rapid change of the @xmath9 ionization fraction ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) .    to tackle this problem ,",
    "we have collected data on lls and dls from all the available literature and perform a comprehensive statistical analysis , based on a maximum likelihood procedure , which allows a joined fit of observations with different @xmath7 sensitivities and uncertainties , with different ionization conditions and at different redshifts .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following : in section  2 we discuss how the observed  column density distribution is related to the total hydrogen distribution for face - on absorbers .",
    "a set of analytical solutions for the cross section of non - spherical absorbers , randomly oriented in space , is reported in appendix a. section  3 contains a description of the database .",
    "section  4 details the statistical algorithm that we use to best fit the  column density distribution of absorbers .",
    "section  4 also summarizes results relative to our database . in section  5",
    "we perform realistic simulations of the data , which are used to test the effectiveness and the robustness of the statistical algorithm .",
    "one physically meaningful quantity for investigating the formation and evolution of gas condensations is the distribution of their gaseous mass .",
    "however observations measure only the distribution of the neutral hydrogen column density along the line of sight , which may present a rather complex behavior even if the face - on total column density distribution is a power law . in this section",
    "we show how to transform one distribution into the other .",
    "the relationship between the total and the neutral column density has been investigated in detail in paper  i. here we focus on the effect of randomly oriented absorbers which are either flat or of ellipsoidal shape .",
    "we show first how a face - on total hydrogen column density distribution @xmath10 translates into a face - on neutral hydrogen distribution @xmath11 . for a generic relationship @xmath12 one can write : @xmath13 if @xmath14 is a pure power - law : @xmath15 @xmath16 is also a power law when @xmath17 : @xmath18 with @xmath19 . for @xmath20 ( an ionization fraction monotonically decreasing with @xmath21 ) and @xmath22",
    ", @xmath16 is always shallower than @xmath23 .    for a generic @xmath12 relationship",
    ", @xmath11 is not tied to a power law .",
    "for example when there is a sharp break in the slope of @xmath12 at @xmath24 , @xmath25 is not continuous at @xmath24 , being larger on the side where its slope is steeper : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the heaviside step function .    similarly we can consider multiple breaks : for example if @xmath28 for large @xmath29 and @xmath30 for small @xmath29 ( as for a constant ionization fraction ) , @xmath25 follows a power law with index @xmath31 in both regions , but the low - column density distribution is shifted by a factor @xmath32 with respect to the extrapolation of the high - column density one .      in this section",
    "we consider the effects of the random orientation of non - spherical absorbers on the observed column density distribution .",
    "we derive a simple analytic solution for `` infinitely thin homogeneous slabs '' , namely those whose thickness ( @xmath33 ) is much smaller than their radial extension ( @xmath34 ) , and whose face - on gas column density is constant .",
    "we then test a simple approximation for treating `` finite thickness slabs '' , using the exact solution for homogeneous ellipsoids , given in appendix a.    let @xmath35 be the differential cross section of an absorber , whose symmetry axis is tilted by an angle @xmath36 with respect to the line of sight .",
    "its differential cross section , averaged over orientations , is : @xmath37 ( where we have defined @xmath38 ) . for",
    "infinitely thin slabs of surface area @xmath39 and face - on column density @xmath29 , the averaged cross section reads : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the dirac distribution . therefore the averaged cross section vanishes for @xmath42 , and is proportional to @xmath43 for @xmath44 .    for absorbers of finite thickness",
    "the exact behavior of @xmath45 depends on their detailed shape , but the following approximate formula holds : @xmath46 it is shown in appendix a that the accuracy of eq .",
    "( [ eq : approx ] ) decreases as @xmath47 grows larger . when @xmath48 , @xmath45 for ellipsoidal absorbers differs noticeably from eq .",
    "( [ eq : approx ] ) ; but , once eq .",
    "( [ eq : approx ] ) is convolved with realistic @xmath25 distributions , results keep close to the exact ones .",
    "the line of sight @xmath7 distribution , @xmath49 , can be written as : @xmath50 which , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : approx ] ) , gives : @xmath51 this equation shows that @xmath49 is sensitive to the values of @xmath25 over the whole range @xmath52 $ ] ( i.e.  @xmath53 $ ] for infinitely thin slabs ) .    if there is a single break in @xmath25 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : singlebreak ] ) , the corresponding @xmath49 is : @xmath54 for @xmath55 and for @xmath56 , @xmath57 follows power laws with indices @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively . in the intermediate @xmath7",
    "range the behavior of @xmath57 is more complex : if @xmath25 is steeper at @xmath55 , its slope approaches @xmath60 for @xmath61 while it bends to connect to the power - law regime at @xmath62 ; in the opposite case @xmath57 suddenly rises for @xmath63 , and then smoothly connects with the high column density power - law branch .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows qualitatively the features present in @xmath49 for a realistic @xmath64 relationship ( see paper i ) : @xmath65 for @xmath66 , @xmath67 elsewhere .",
    "we choose @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 to emphasize the various regimes described above .",
    "note that @xmath49 at low column densities is lower by a factor @xmath73 with respect to the extrapolation of the distribution at high column densities ( dashed line ) . at intermediate column densities",
    "a dip in the distribution appears , approaching a @xmath60 slope towards the low column density side .",
    "in this section we show which information should be extracted from the large number of dls&lls surveys available in order to build up a homogeneous database for a global statistical approach .    in a lls the value of @xmath7",
    "can be determined from the ratio between @xmath74 , the residual lyman continuum flux on the blue side of the break , and @xmath75 , the unabsorbed continuum flux : @xmath76 if the residual flux @xmath74 is too small to be measured , only a lower limit to @xmath7 can be derived : this usually happens for @xmath77 . since there are measurements sensitive to lyman continuum optical depths as small as 0.4 , we include in our database all lls surveys which are sensitive to @xmath78 .",
    "we include in the compilation all available searches for absorption lines with a rest frame equivalent width @xmath79 , for which @xmath7 can be estimated from : @xmath80 a complication comes from the fact that spurious lines with large equivalent width may result from a blending of weaker lines with metal line systems or lyman-@xmath0 forest lines .",
    "only some surveys have sufficient spectral resolution to test , by fitting a voigt profile , whether lines with @xmath81 are really damped . in our database",
    "we include both the column density value determined directly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : width ] ) and that derived from the voigt profile fit , whenever this is available . by comparing these two values we find that there is a bias in the @xmath7 values estimated from the equivalent width , and derive the following statistical correction : @xmath82 we apply this correction to all absorption lines for which only the @xmath83 value is available .",
    "if only a lower limit to @xmath84 can be derived from the lyman continuum absorption , searches for the corresponding damped lyman-@xmath0 line can be used to establish a value or an upper limit to the  column density .",
    "if the corresponding lyman-@xmath85 absorption line has not been searched for , we take an upper limit of @xmath86 , which is the highest measured value of @xmath7 in our database .",
    "unfortunately upper limits to saturated lls leave large uncertainties in the column density range @xmath87 , where theoretical predictions are very sensitive to the detailed shape of the @xmath64 relationship .",
    "hence it is essential to find a correct statistical approach for evaluating the @xmath7 distribution in the presence of large uncertainties to determine the ionization conditions of the gas as well as the total gas column density distribution in lls and dls .",
    "we have collected data from the following references : @xcite . in order to ensure an accurate estimate of the coverage of the survey",
    "we have excluded from the compilation the full spectrum or part of it whenever the continuum was visually found to be very noisy or non - uniform ( e.g.  some spectrum edges where the flux is below the 2-@xmath88 level in @xcite or the objects 1130 - 106y , pks1206 + 459 , mc1215 + 113 in @xcite ) .",
    "the final number of directions i.e.  of qsos included is 661 .",
    "we have decided to split each direction in parts ( hereafter called `` paths '' ) such that each path is defined by homogeneous search parameters and contains at most one detection . in other words",
    "one direction may correspond to more than one path if different sensitivities are used , or if more than one absorber is present along the line of sight .",
    "our database is available in electronic form upon request to the authors .",
    "parameters contained in the data table can be divided into two groups : those describing the search , and those related to the detection .",
    "the main parameters associated with the search coverage are : _",
    "( i ) _  the redshift path limits , i.e.  the upper and lower redshift for one direction in space observed with a given sensitivity ; _ ( ii ) _  the sensitivity , specified by the threshold above which @xmath7 was detectable .    for each direction the upper redshift was set to @xmath89 less than the qso redshift , whenever the spectral coverage extends beyond it .",
    "we have usually taken as the lowest redshift that given by the observers .",
    "this does not coincide with the spectral coverage boundary in the presence of `` shadowing effect '' .",
    "the `` shadowing effect '' intervenes whenever the continuum flux , absorbed by a lls at @xmath90 , gets below detectability : in this case the lower limit of the path has been set to @xmath90 . if no dls searches have been performed no further paths are appended along that direction ; otherwise , due to the different frequency of the lyman-@xmath0 line respect to the h ionization threshold , further paths are considered between @xmath90 and the lyman-@xmath0 shadowing redshift ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the lowest redshift of the lls search in the absence of shadowing is reported in the database as well , since in section  5 it will be used for simulating data samples .",
    "the sensitivity for a lyman - limit search depends on the minimum opacity detectable in the survey : typically @xmath92 , 1.0 or 1.5 , corresponding to column density thresholds @xmath9316.81 , 17.20 and 17.38 respectively .",
    "we have set to 0.4 the minimum detectable @xmath84 for observations listed in @xcite and @xcite ; we have instead set to 1.0 the threshold for all the observations listed in @xcite and @xcite which were revised by @xcite . for absorption line searches with rest frame equivalent width @xmath94 the sensitivity of the path",
    "was set to @xmath95 ( since we have applied the correction given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ncorr ] ) ) .",
    "if both lls and dls searches were performed on the same path the threshold of the path was set to the lowest of the two , except in the presence of shadowing effects .",
    "the parameters associated with the detections are : _",
    "( i ) _  the redshift of the detected absorber ; _ ( ii ) _  the decimal logarithm of the estimated  column density of the absorber along the line of sight ( @xmath96 ) ; _ ( iii ) _  the minimum and the maximum allowed values for @xmath96 ; _ ( iv ) _  the voigt correction factors .",
    "when @xmath96 could not be determined from @xmath84 or @xmath83 measures , but only limits for it are available , we have reported as @xmath96 the arithmetic mean between the minimum and maximum allowed values .",
    "when instead the value of @xmath96 could be directly determined we have estimated the minimum and maximum allowed values by assuming a standard spread . in the case of non - saturated lls we have used a spread of @xmath97 in decimal logarithm , except for the cases listed in @xcite for which we took the uncertainties quoted by the authors . in the case of dls we have used again a spread of @xmath97 when the line profile has been resolved and the voigt profile has been fitted ; otherwise we have used @xmath98 .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath96 that we quote are usually larger than those that can be directly derived from uncertainties on either @xmath84 or @xmath83 .",
    "this is because there are other sources of errors , such as the determination of the level of the continuum ( which affects both @xmath83 and @xmath84 estimates ) , or the possible blending with other small absorption lines .",
    "the voigt correction factors are the differences between the @xmath96 values derived from the voigt - profile fit and those from @xmath83 ( eq .  ( [ eq : width ] ) ) .",
    "two further columns contain flags , which are different from 0 whenever lls and dls searches respectively have been performed on a given path .",
    "a value of @xmath99 implies that no systems were found , a value of 1 means that the column density estimate is quite accurate , 2 that it is less accurate and 3 that it is very uncertain , as for dls declared `` non damped '' . in this last case",
    "the column density value for the dls has been set to zero , or used as an upper limit if saturated lls are detected at the same redshift .",
    "the coverage of the whole sample , with and without shadowing , for various search sensitivities is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where the inhomogeneity of the actual coverage is evident .",
    "various authors have analyzed lyman-@xmath85 absorbers data to determine the @xmath7 distribution and/or its evolution with time .",
    "nevertheless no statistical analysis of the @xmath7 distribution in lls and dls has been attempted so far using all available data and without a pre - defined coarse binning . in the following",
    "we show how to perform a global unbinned statistical analysis of heterogeneous data .",
    "our approach for estimating the @xmath7 distribution is similar to the maximum likelihood analysis used by @xcite , with the following two improvements : _",
    "we use a generic ( not just a pure power - law ) distribution for @xmath7 ; _ ( ii ) _",
    "we take into account uncertainties in the @xmath7 measurements . in order to simplify the notation we shall use the symbol @xmath100 instead of @xmath7 in this section as well as in section  4.2 .",
    "let @xmath101 be the distribution of column density @xmath100 at redshift @xmath102 .",
    "the average number of detections along a given direction is @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the area of an infinitesimal cell in the @xmath100@xmath102 plane . for infinitesimal cells",
    "the probability of having more than one detection in the same cell is negligible .",
    "the probabilities of having zero or one detection in a given cell are respectively : @xmath105 the likelihood for a given data set is the product of the probabilities over `` all '' cells in the @xmath100@xmath102 plane and over all directions in space .",
    "this product can be separated into two factors , one relative to the `` empty '' cells , and the other to the `` full '' cells : @xmath106 we know the total number of full cells ( i.e.  the number of detections , hereafter @xmath107 ) but we might not be able to position the detections into specific cells in the @xmath100@xmath102 plane due to the large uncertainties of @xmath100 .",
    "for instance , if a detection has @xmath108 in the range @xmath109 $ ] , the absorber is in one of the cells of this @xmath100 range , but we do nt know in which one : the probability for this event is the sum of probabilities relative to the cells ( the same considerations would apply to errors in @xmath102 if redshifts are not well determined ) . in the limit of small cell sizes ,",
    "the sum is then approximated by an integral of @xmath57 over the allowed range of @xmath100 , and the logarithmic value of @xmath110 reads : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the number of different paths at a given @xmath102 with a column density threshold smaller than @xmath100 .",
    "the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : likeli0 ] ) is related only to the parameters of the search , and can be evaluated using the normalization condition for @xmath57 : @xmath113 we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : likeli0 ] ) using the above normalization condition : @xmath114 if column densities have been measured with a rather small uncertainty for a number @xmath115 of absorbers , eq .",
    "( [ eq : likeli ] ) can be approximated as : @xmath116 which allows a faster numerical computation .",
    "the terms with @xmath117 and @xmath118 are constant and can be neglected while searching for the maximum value of @xmath110 . the limiting case @xmath119 reduces eq .",
    "( [ eq : likelisl ] ) to the formula in @xcite .",
    "the maximum likelihood analysis does not contain any statistical test on the goodness of the `` best '' solution for @xmath57 , since the absolute value of @xmath110 is undetermined by a constant factor .",
    "such a test can be done for example by comparing the theoretical versus the observational cumulative function . for large uncertainties of the column density values",
    ", this comparison requires a reasonable guess at the `` true '' value of @xmath100 for each individual detection .",
    "a `` reasonable '' guess does not necessarily mean that each @xmath100 value should reproduce the true one but that their overall distribution can not be distinguished from the original one .",
    "we will show how to find this `` reasonable '' guess in the presence of large measurement uncertainties in @xmath100 in order to avoid the use of a coarse binning .    for a given absorber @xmath120 the probability of having a true column density smaller than @xmath100 in the allowed range @xmath109 $ ]",
    "is : @xmath121 @xmath122 behave as random quantities and should have a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath123 $ ] , independently of the shape of the distribution function @xmath57 .",
    "the probability of having a detection with column density smaller than @xmath100 in the overall @xmath100 range , is : @xmath124 the distribution of @xmath125 should also be uniform in the interval @xmath123 $ ] , and is equivalent to the @xmath100 cumulative distribution for a narrow range of redshift .    for a sample of @xmath126 ( sorted for increasing @xmath126 values , with @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) the cumulative distribution",
    "can be written as : @xmath129 the conventional way to test whether a given a distribution is compatible with the uniform one is to use the kolmogorov - smirnov test on the maximum deviation between the two cumulative functions : @xmath130 the significance of @xmath131 being given by the function @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "however if the maximum discrepancy between the two distributions originates from some bias , the kolmogorov - smirnov test becomes completely insensitive to the overall match .",
    "such effect is reduced if instead of @xmath131 we use the quantity @xmath133 : @xmath134 @xmath133 varies with @xmath126 more smoothly than @xmath131 does , and its significance is @xmath135 @xcite",
    ". we will use @xmath133 for testing the uniformity of @xmath122 and @xmath125 since it is practically more effective and robust than @xmath131 to ensure a good matching over the whole @xmath100 range .",
    "for any given distribution @xmath57 we compute a `` best guess '' for the `` true '' column densities by maximizing the product of the significances relative to @xmath136 and to @xmath137 ( hereafter referred to as @xmath138 and @xmath139 , respectively ) .",
    "there are always infinite guesses which allow a uniform distribution for @xmath122 .",

    "we now investigate the possible dependence of @xmath85 and of the cumulative function on the limiting value of @xmath153 for the treatment of errors , keeping @xmath143 fixed to 2.82 .",
    "we consider 4 different cases : ( a ) no error treatment , i.e.  for all absorbers we use the estimated  column density ( either the measured value or the middle point in the allowed @xmath96 range ) ; ( b ) and ( c ) error treatment has been applied to all the detections with @xmath153 equal to 0.9 and 0.5 respectively ; ( d ) error treatment has been applied to all detections ( @xmath154 ) .",

    "however , since these variations are of the same order of parameter uncertainties , they could just be statistical fluctuations .",
    "further insight will come out from the simulated data analysis in the next session .",
    "an issue that will be discussed more in detail in a future paper is whether line blending is present in the data and could affect the above results .",
    "the probability of blending of lyman-@xmath0 lines is relatively low for randomly distributed absorbers , but clustering or blending with some metal lines might imply a somewhat higher probability and affect lines with @xmath157 , sometimes declared as non damped . to address this point",

    "we have devised a routine to simulate data in a highly realistic way : starting from an `` a priori '' distribution function for the absorbers total column densities , it generates a data set compatible with a given column density and redshift coverage . in the present work we use a coverage consistent with the observations listed in our database .",
    "the basic ingredients of the simulation are : 1 .  an original distribution function of @xmath21 for absorbers of a given geometrical shape ; 2 .",
    "an @xmath21@xmath29 relationship for each redshift bin ; 3 .  a @xmath7@xmath102 coverage for the simulated survey . after the total",
    "face - on column density has been transformed into a line of sight  value , we introduce measurement errors similar to those present in the actual survey compilation .",
    "these errors are simulated by deriving first the random quantities @xmath122 , uniformly distributed , and then locating the uncertainties @xmath158 $ ] such that the position of `` true '' values @xmath7 corresponds to @xmath122 . when @xmath159 , is above @xmath160 the absorption",
    "is considered as saturated . in this case , if there has been a search for the corresponding damped lyman-@xmath0 but the line has not been found , the uncertainty range is set to @xmath161{{\\,\\rm cm^{-2}}}$ ] ; if instead the damped lyman-@xmath0 line has not been searched for , the uncertainty range is set to @xmath162{{\\,\\rm cm^{-2}}}$ ] .    for saturated absorption we simulate also the shadowing effect .",
    "shadowed absorbers are eliminated from the sample and the @xmath7@xmath102 coverage of the survey is modified accordingly for lls and dls searches : this `` after - shadowing '' coverage is what should be compared with the real data coverage .",
    "we first simulate samples of data consistent with the maximum likelihood solution @xmath163 , @xmath149 , obtained for real data in the @xmath102 range [ 1.75,3.25 ] for @xmath164 .",
    "results of the statistical analysis on one of our simulated data samples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where the efficiency of our method in recovering the original distribution is clear .",
    "[ fig5 ] is the analogous of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for real data , the only difference being that now in ( a ) the `` true '' values of @xmath7 for simulated data are used , without any degradation by measurement processes and are compared directly with the model .",
    "the slight disagreement between the two curves in ( a ) is indicative of the magnitude of statistical fluctuations in the simulation .",
    "@xmath110 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 for the simulated sample show a behavior very similar to that for real data ( table 1 ) .",
    "an increase in the number of detections on which the treatment of errors is applied improves the match between the `` measured '' distributions and the original ones .",
    "our algorithm is very efficient in recovering the original @xmath122 distribution as well but there is no way to recover the original @xmath122 values of individual detections .",
    "detections with the same range of column densities are in all respects identical among themselves , and any permutation between their respective @xmath122 values can not be traced ( i.e.  there is no correlation between the `` true '' and derived @xmath122 values ) .    to investigate if the selection of an error threshold affects the determination of @xmath0 we have produced 5000 different simulated samples with @xmath163 . on each sample",
    "we apply the analysis with the 4 different error thresholds as in fig .",
    "the results , reported in table  [ tab2 ] , show that the best fit @xmath85 values are only slightly smaller than the original ones , and the dispersion for the best @xmath0 values found ( @xmath165 ) is consistent with the average estimated uncertainty ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "we can also use the simulated data to check the uncertainties in the best - fitting parameters ( @xmath0,@xmath143 ) by producing a confidence level map for the simulated data , for 3 @xmath102-selected subsamples , analogously to what has been done in section  4.3 for the real data ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows for one simulated sample that the confidence levels present an elongation similar to the levels in fig .",
    "this means that in the real data there is no evidence of deviations of the gas distribution from our model assumptions .",
    "the elongation depends on a partial degeneracy of models in the @xmath0-@xmath143 plane : @xmath85 should increase as @xmath143 increases to give the same slope for the distribution of low  column density lls , a drawback that will be difficult to cure by a moderate increase of the numbers of known absorbers .    by looking at the three subsamples ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) it is clear that statistical fluctuations are present mostly in the direction of the elongation , consistently with the estimated uncertainties . with the present sample coverage the real data are still consistent with no evolution of @xmath0 and @xmath143 , but some evolution can not be excluded , especially for the high redshift sample . for this sample in fact",
    "the shift of the probability contours is not in the direction of elongation but mostly towards lower values of @xmath143 .",
    "this would imply that either the ionizing flux is lower or that the absorbing gas has higher volume densities than at lower redshifts .",
    "our analysis shows that in order to have a definite answer on the evolution of @xmath0 and @xmath143 closer contour levels are needed .",
    "this can be achieved by determining observationally the column density of saturated lls ( through lines in other spectral regions or through the recover of the quasar flux at shorter wavelengths ) or by increasing the number of known high @xmath7 dls .",
