    "when two smbhs coalesce at the final stage of galaxy interaction , _ a merged smbh _ can recoil from the host galaxy due to anisotropic emission of gravitational waves .",
    "recent simulations of merging black holes predict that the merged smbh can attain a kick velocity of a few hundred to a few thousands km s@xmath10 depending on mass ratios , spin magnitudes , and spin orientations of the merging smbhs ( campanelli et al . 2007 ; schnittman 2007 ; baker et al . 2008 ; lousto & zlochower 2011 ) .",
    "if the merging smbhs are of equal mass , are highly - spinning , and their spins are aligned along the orbital plane ( superkick configuration ) , recoil velocities as large as 4000 km s@xmath10 ( campanelli et al .",
    "2007 ) to 5000 km s@xmath10 ( lousto & zlochower 2011 ) can be reached and the recoiling smbh ( hereafter rsmbh ) will eventually escape from the host galaxy ( i.e. , merritt et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the rsmbh carries along with it the broad - line region ( blr ) and leaves the starburst nucleus behind ( blecha et al .",
    "2011 ; sijacki et al .",
    "thus , they will have two observational characteristics : i ) broad emission lines will have velocity offsets with respect to the systemic velocity ( merritt et al .",
    "2006 ; kinematic offset ) , and ii ) the center of the blr will be spatially offset from stellar center of the host galaxy ( spatial offset ) .",
    "bonning et al .",
    "( 2007 ) conducted a search for rsmbhs by measuring kinematic offsets in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) dr3 qso spectra , but failed to detect any .",
    "they placed upper limits on the incidence of rsmbhs in qsos of 0.2% for kick velocities",
    "greater than 800 .",
    "their result suggests that the majority of the kick velocities might be a few hundreds  or even less than 100   ( i.e. dotti et al . 2010 ) .",
    "in such a case , broad emission lines from rsmbhs will be well blended with the narrow emission lines , and a careful deblending is required to decompose each emission line component .",
    "a similar systematic search was carried out by eracleous et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , but mainly aimed at detecting close binary smbhs whose broad h@xmath11 emission lines are displaced from the quasar rest frame by more than 1000 . by analyzing hubble space telescope archival images of 14 nearby core ellipticals , lena et al .",
    "( 2014 ) find evidence for small ( 10 pc ) displacements between the agn and host galaxy center in six of them .",
    "they found that the displacement axis in 4 out of these 6 galaxies is aligned with the radio source axis suggesting intrinsic asymmetries in radio jet power as a possible displacement mechanism .",
    "comerford & greene ( 2014 ) surveyed sdss spectra to search for offset agns that are produced by galaxy interaction where one of the black holes is fueled as an agn , but they excluded sources with velocity offsets produced by rsmbhs .",
    "one of the interesting rsmbh candidates so far is a cid-42 ( also known as cxoc j100043.1 + 020637 ) .",
    "it has two compact optical sources separated by @xmath52.5 kpc and has a large velocity offset ( @xmath51200 @xmath12 ) between the h@xmath11 narrow and broad emission line components ( civano et al .",
    "chandra observations find that the south - eastern source that has a point - like morphology typical of a bright agn is responsible for the whole x - ray emission in this system ( civano et al .",
    "the north - western source has a more extended profile in the optical band with a scale length of @xmath50.5 kpc .",
    "recent 3 ghz karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) observations find that the entire observed 3 ghz radio emission can be associated with the south - eastern component of this system ( novak et al .",
    "their finding preferred rsmbh picture but can not rule out the presence of an obscured and radio - quiet smbh in the north - western source .",
    "detection of rsmbhs will have a significant impact in astrophysics .",
    "a scaling law between the smbh mass and host galaxy bulge has been suggested by many correlations : smbh mass vs. bulge luminosity ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ) , bulge mass ( magorrian et al . 1998 ) , and stellar velocity dispersion ( gebhardt et al . 2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; tremaine et al .",
    "these correlations implicitly assume that the merged smbh stays in the center of host galaxy . if the recoil velocity is less than the escape velocity ( @xmath131500 km s@xmath10 in elliptical galaxies , i.e. merritt et al .",
    "2004 ) , which is true in most cases ( dotti et al .",
    "2010 ) , the rsmbhs will be oscillating about the center of their host galaxies ( blecha et al . 2011 ) . from numerical simulations ,",
    "blecha et al . (",
    "2011 ) predicted that the oscillating smbhs may be up to five times less massive than their stationary counterparts and could be a source of intrinsic scatter in the smbh and stellar bulge mass scaling law .",
    "the agn feedback and outflow regulate starburst activity in merging galaxies , but if the central agn is displaced by a recoil event , it enhances star formation rates in the center of host galaxy ( blecha et al .",
    "the oscillating smbhs can also induce interesting results in unified models of agn .",
    "an obscured type 2 qso with its blr hidden by the molecular torus will appear as unobscured type 1 qso during the recoil oscillations , when moving beyond the torus scale ( komossa & merritt 2008 ) .",
    "the kicking mechanism of the rsmbh is due to an anisotropic radiation of the gravitational wave in merging black holes and detection of the rsmbhs will be an indirect observational evidence of the existence of the gravitational wave . despite of these astrophysical importance , none of the rsmbhs has been positively identified yet .",
    "thus , we have undertaken spectral decomposition project for the nearby sdss qsos to identify rsmbhs .",
    "the paper is divided into four sections . in section 2",
    ", the sample selection process of the rsmbh candidates is described .",
    "the results and discussion are presented in sections 3 , and a summary of the paper is presented in section 4 . throughout this paper , the cosmology h@xmath14 = 70 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , @xmath16 = 0.3 , and @xmath17 = 0.7 are adopted .",
    "to select rsmbh candidates , we used a complete sample of 1271 z @xmath18 0.25 sdss dr7 qso ( schneider et al .",
    "2010 , hereafter sdss qso ) spectra .",
    "the size @xmath19 of the rsmbhs is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is mass of the black hole and @xmath22 is the kick velocity ( merritt et al .",
    "2009 ) . with typical values of @xmath23 and @xmath22=200 @xmath12 ,",
    "the size of rsmbh becomes @xmath55 pc , which is large enough to carry blr .",
    "thus , if the rsmbhs are recoiled from the host galaxy , broad emission lines will show velocity offsets with respect to systemic velocity .",
    "1 illustrates model spectra of h@xmath24 [ n ii ] for an object with no velocity offset in broad - line ( fig .",
    "1a ) , a blr coming toward us ( blueshifted 200 km@xmath10 with respect to systemic , fig .",
    "1b ) , and a blr moving away from us ( redshifted 200 km@xmath10 with respect to systemic , fig .",
    "1c ) .    as a first step for searching for rsmbh candidates",
    ", we have visually inspected the sdss qso spectra and selected spectra showing blueshifted broad - line with respect to systemic as shown in fig",
    "we favor blueshifts because it will be easier to see the rsmbhs coming toward us rather than moving away from us due to extinction in the host galaxy .",
    "the broad - line velocity offsets can be produced by gas motion in the accretion disk around a single bh ( so called disk - emitters ; chen et al . 1989 ; eracleous & halpern 1994 ; chornock et al . 2010 ) or binary smbhs ( komossa et al .",
    "2003 ; zhou et al . 2004",
    "; eracleous et al .",
    "2012 ; shen et al .",
    "thus , we have excluded spectra having widely separated and highly asymmetric two broad - line profiles ( disk - emitters ) and double - peaked emission lines ( binary smbhs ) in this stage . for the systemic velocity , we used low - ionization ( ionization potential = 10.36 ev ) forbidden lines [ s ii]@xmath25 which are expected to be less influenced by central engine . if the [ s ii]@xmath25 lines are not available , we used either [ n ii ] @xmath26 or core component of [ o iii ] @xmath27 lines since [ o iii ] line often shows blueshifted wing component ( i.e. boroson 2005 ) .",
    "this step resulted in 124 candidates and for these objects , we have performed a detailed spectral decomposition .    in the spectral decomposition",
    ", we used the h@xmath28 line instead of the h@xmath29 line since the h@xmath28 line is about 3 times stronger than the h@xmath29 line and free from fe ii line contamination .",
    "we used the iraf / specfit package with 3 component fits : i ) power - law continuum , ii ) broad emission line , and iii ) narrow emission line .",
    "we applied a single lorentzian or a single gaussian profile for the h@xmath28 broad - line component and a single gaussian profile for the h@xmath28 and [ n ii ] narrow line components .",
    "the same gaussian line widths were used for the narrow emission lines of h@xmath28 and [ n ii ] , and a fixed value of @xmath30 was used for the [ nii]6548 to [ nii]6583 line ratio . from spectral decomposition ,",
    "we have identified 37 rsmbh candidates whose h@xmath28 broad - lines are blueshifted more than 1.5 which corresponds to instrumental dispersion of 69 km s@xmath31 of the sdss spectra , with respect to systemic velocity . in this stage , we applied one more constraint before selecting the final rsmbh candidates .",
    "it is known that line widths of h@xmath32 and h@xmath11 broad - lines are well correlated ( i.e. eq .",
    "3 of greene & ho 2005 ) .",
    "this suggests that their line emitting gases are co - spatial .",
    "thus , if the h@xmath32 broad - line velocity offset was produced by recoiling blr , we should see a similar amount of velocity offset in h@xmath11 broad - line too .",
    "we have measured velocity offsets in the h@xmath11 broad - line using 4 components fit : i ) power - law continuum , ii ) broad emission line , iii ) narrow emission line , and iv ) [ fe ii ] lines . to select the final rsbmh candidates , we have applied the following arbitary selection criterion : we excluded sources whose h@xmath29 broad - line velocity offset is either 50% smaller or 50% larger than that of the h@xmath28 broad - line velocity offset .",
    "after applying this criterion , the final number of rsmbh candidates becomes 26 .",
    "2 shows correlation of velocity offset between the h@xmath28 and h@xmath29 broad - lines , * where solid and dotted lines are one - to - one correspondence and @xmath33 deviation from the one - to - one correspondence , respectively . for the final 26 rsmbh candidates , * we see a good correlation of velocity offsets between h@xmath28 and h@xmath29 broad - lines ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the h@xmath29 broad - lines are on average @xmath35 more blueshifted than the h@xmath28 broad - lines .",
    "3 shows results of spectral decompositions for h@xmath28 and h@xmath29 lines for the final rsmbh candidates , where black , cyan , blue , green , magenta , and red lines represent data , power - law continuum , broad emission line , narrow emission lines , [ o iii ] lines , and model ( sum of all fitting components ) , respectively .",
    "dotted lines represent [ fe ii ] lines and vertical dotted line in each plot represents rest frame line center for the h@xmath28 and h@xmath29 lines .",
    "fitting residuals ( data / model in percentage ) are shown on the bottom of each plot .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we used gaussian or lorentzian profile to fit h@xmath28 broad - line , but interestingly the h@xmath28 broad - line profiles for the rsmbh candidates are all found to be lorentzian which suggests they originate by a turbulent velocity field .",
    "carmona - loaiza et al .",
    "( 2015 ) find that turbulence dominates corotating inflows near the smbhs and significantly enhance accretion activity .",
    "thus , turbulence could be a dominant velocity field in the accretion disk of the rsmbhs .",
    "table 1 lists basic properties of the final 26 rsmbh candidates . the fraction of the rsmbh candidates in sdss qso spectra with z @xmath18 0.25 is @xmath52% .",
    "if we assume the fraction of the rsmbh moving away from us has a similar fraction , about 4% of the sdss qsos are rsmbhs . * a histogram of projected recoil velocities measured from h@xmath28 broad - line",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "4a . the projected recoil velocities range from @xmath1 to @xmath2 with an average of @xmath3 . except for one ,",
    "all candidates have recoil velocities smaller than absolute value of @xmath36 .",
    "the lack of detecting rsmbh candidates with large recoil velocities could be explained either by a finite size of sdss fiber radius ( see  3.2 ) or orbital configuration in merging black holes that produces large recoil velocities ( @xmath37 ) is rare .",
    "4b shows a plot of recoil velocity vs. velocity dispersion of the rsmbh candidates .",
    "though the correlation is poor ( r=0.17 ) , we see a trend that the broad - line velocity offset tends to increase with decreasing velocity dispersion .",
    "velocity dispersion has a linear correlation with mass ( i.e. m-@xmath38 relation ) .",
    "thus , the rsmbhs with large recoil velocities are more likely to be found in less massive galaxies and the rsmbhs with small recoil velocities are more likely to be found in more massive galaxies .",
    "this can naturally be understood in terms of escape velocity since massive galaxies have large escape velocities and exert more gravitational drag to the rsmbhs and trap them to undergo oscillatory motion .",

    "we can estimate projected spatial offsets between the rsmbhs and center of host galaxy .",
    "the projected recoil velocities are the radial components of the actual ones and the projected spatial offsets are the transversal components of the actual ones .",
    "if we assume random recoil direction ( polar angle @xmath47 = azimuthal angle @xmath48 = 45@xmath49 ) for ease of calculation , the expected spatial offset will be the recoil velocity times the agn lifetime .",
    "column 8 in table 1 lists the expected spatial offsets calculated by adopting an agn lifetime of 10 myr for rsmbhs ( blecha et al .",
    "the estimated spatial offsets are maximum values for the agn lifetime of 10 myr and range from 0.21@xmath9  to 1.97@xmath9  ( 0.79 kpc to 3.14 kpc ) with a mean of 0.51@xmath9@xmath70.35@xmath9  ( 1.52@xmath70.59 kpc ) .",

    ". the limited radius of sdss fiber could explain why we could nt detect high - velocity rsmbhs even if they exist .",
    "the recoil velocities we have measured are only about 10% to 20% of the typical escape velocity in elliptical galaxy ( @xmath131500 km s@xmath10 ) . in such a case , the rsmbh candidates will undergo damped oscillations around the center of host galaxy ( gualandris & merritt 2008 ; blecha et al .",

    "if most of the interacting galaxies must go through this stage , then it will be an important evolutionary path in the galaxy evolution we have missed so far .",
    "it is suggested that star formation in galaxies is regulated by agn feedback and outflow ( fabian 2012 ; tombesi et al .",
    "if the central agn is displaced by a recoil event , it will no longer result in quenching but instead enhancing central star formation in the host galaxy ( blecha et al .",

    "for some sources , the default parameter values in addscan / scanpi yielded a poor fit and could not be used to compute the iras fluxes .",

    "if this is the case , gravitational recoil event could happen long after the merging event when the tital features were almost faded .",
    "the broad - line velocity offsets can be produced by disk - emitters or binary smbhs , but in the candidate selection process , we have excluded these sources .",
    "an agn outflow powered by radiation pressure from the accretion disk or radio jets can produce a blueshifted broad - line velocity offset ( harrison et al .",

    "if the blueshifted h@xmath28 broad emission line is produced by outflow , we would expect to observe a correlation of the velocity offsets between the h@xmath28 broad - line and [ o iii]@xmath695007 wing component . to measure the velocity offset in the [ o iii ] wing component",

    "we find only a weak correlation ( r=0.35 ) of velocity offsets between the h@xmath28 broad - line and [ o iii]@xmath695007 wing component .",
    "this suggests that the agn outflow could be responsible for the broad - line offset for a few individual sources , but not likely for the whole sample .",
    "another scenario for producing narrow lines plus blueshifted broad lines is an interacting / merging system with double nuclei : one nucleus is seyfert producing broad and narrow lines and the other one is either liner or h ii galaxy producing narrow lines . as discussed in section 3.1 ,",
    "only 6 rsmbh candidates show tidal signatures .",
    "if these rsmbhs are seyfert and liner / hii pairs , we would observe two distinct sets of narrow forbidden lines in the spectra .",
    "we have inspected the spectra of all 26 rsmbh candidates , but none of them have two sets of narrow lines .",

    "the presence of high - excitation forbidden lines whose ionization potential @xmath70 is larger than he ii ionization edge ( 54.4 ev ) is an unambiguous sign of agn activity .",
    "it is known that the high - excitation coronal lines are often blueshifted by a few hundreds km s@xmath10 with respect to systemic ( appenzeller & oestreicher 1988 ; erkens et al .",
    "1997 ; mullaney et al .",
    "2009 ; gelbord et al .",
    "if the rsmbhs are indeed recoiling , the blueshift of the high - excitation coronal lines will be the sum of the recoil velocity plus the blueshift component of the coronal lines ( i.e. more blueshifted than their stationary counterpart ) .",
    "thus , the high - excitation coronal lines can be used to probe the origin of the broad - line velocity offset in rsmbhs .",
    "we have inspected spectra of the rsmbhs and find 23 out of 26 ( 88% ) and 11 out of 26 ( 42% ) of the rsmbhs have high - excitation coronal lines of [ ne v]@xmath693426 ( @xmath70=97.11 ev ) and [ fe vii]@xmath696087 ( @xmath70=99.00 ev ) , respectively .",
    "we found that most of the coronal lines in our candidates have two components : a narrow core component and blueshifted broad wing component .",
    "spectral decomposition was performed for [ ne v]@xmath693426 and [ fe vii]@xmath696087 lines and their results are listed in table 3 . as summarized in table 3 ,",

    "their sample can be regarded as stationary agns since their h@xmath32 broad - line velocity offset with respect to systemic is only @xmath713@xmath726 km s@xmath10 .",
    "thus , this result offers further evidence ( although still circumstancial ) that rsmbh candidates are indeed recoiling with a mean recoil velocity of about @xmath71265 km s@xmath10 . for a combined sample of [ ne v]@xmath693426 and [ fe vii]@xmath696087 ,",
    "the average velocity offsets become @xmath71270@xmath7190 km s@xmath10 and @xmath71665@xmath7400 km s@xmath10 for core and wing component , respectively .",
    "compared to the core component , the @xmath72400 km s@xmath10 larger velocity offset in wing component could indicate that these lines originate closer to the agn center .",
    "velocity offset plots between h@xmath32 broad - line and coronal lines are presented in fig .",

    "the dotted lines represent one - to - one correspondence and the dashed lines are least - square fit of the data .",
    "we find a weak correlation ( @xmath73=0.26 ) between the h@xmath32 broad - line and core components of the coronal lines , and no correlation ( @xmath73=0.07 ) between the h@xmath32 broad - line and wing components of the coronal lines .",
    "though they have poor correlations , best fit slopes of the dashed lines are almost parallel to those of the dotted lines ( i.e. coronal lines have constant velocity offsets with respect to h@xmath32 broad - line ) .",
    "these two results suggest that the velocity offset between h@xmath32 broad - line and coronal lines are not locally correlated , probably because the physical / kinematic conditions of the line emitting regions are different , but globally well correlated due to recoil motion .",
    "further evidence that the rsmbh candidates are actually recoiling is found in the velocity offset between h@xmath32 broad - line and coronal lines . as shown in fig .",
    "8c , we find a good correlation ( r=0.77 ) of velocity offset between two coronal lines [ ne v]@xmath693426 and [ fe vii]@xmath696087 .",
    "this , along with a similar @xmath70 for [ ne v]@xmath693426 ( 97.11 ev ) and [ fe vii]@xmath696087 ( 99.00 ev ) , indicate that these lines are originated from kinematically / spatially similar regions .",
    "diagnostic line ratios ( baldwin , phillips & terlevich 1981 ; veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ; kewley et al .",
    "2006 ) of the rsmbh candidates have been investigated to see if they can provide a clue for the origin of broad - line velocity offset .",

    "the overall distribution of line ratios for the rsmbhs are similar to those of the sdss qsos . however , we notice that a higher fraction of h ii region sources is found in rsmbh candidates than in sdss qsos : about 19% and 23% of the rsmbhs fall in h ii region in [ n ii]/h@xmath32 and [ s ii]/h@xmath32 plots , respectively whereas only 3% and 11% of the sdss qsos fall in h ii region in [ n ii]/h@xmath32 and [ s ii]/h@xmath32 plots , respectively . the large fraction of h ii region sources in rsmbh candidates could be related with a combined effect of spatially offset agn and density - stratified nlr .    to investigate further",
    ", we have divided the rsmbh candidates into two groups : h ii region group ( 5 sources inside red - dotted circles in the plots ) and agn group ( the rest of the sources ) .",
    "we find that narrow line luminosities in h ii region rsmbh candidates are on average about 4.0 , 5.2 , and 6.5 times smaller for [ o iii ] , [ n ii ] , and [ s ii ] lines , respectively than those in agn rsmbh candidates .",
    "if the h ii rsmbh are spatially more offset from center of host galaxy than the agn rsmbhs , they will have smaller electron density and their narrow line luminosities will be weaker than that in agn rsmbhs under density - stratified nlr environment ( e.g. , filippenko & halpern 1984 ; veilleux 1991 ) .",
    "we tested this hypothesis by calculating electron density @xmath74 from [ s ii]6716/[s ii]6731 ratio using the temden task in nebular package of the iraf / stsdas ( shaw & dufour 1995 ) assuming typical temperature of @xmath75k in line emitting region of the agns ( osterbrock & ferland 2006 ) .",
    "the temden task numerically solves the equilibrium equation for a 5-level atom approximation developed by de robertis et al .",
    "as expected , the mean @xmath74 in the h ii region rsmbh candidates ( @xmath76 @xmath77 , median=0 @xmath77 ) is about 10 times smaller than that in agn rsmbh candidates ( @xmath78 @xmath77 , median=266 @xmath77 ) . in section 3.1 , we have estimated the expected spatial offset for the rsmbh by assuming random recoil direction .",
    "even if we used this crude assumption , the spatial offset in h ii region rsmbh candidates ( mean=@xmath79 kpc , median=1.7 kpc ) is @xmath530% larger than that in agn rsmbh candidates ( mean=@xmath80 kpc , median=1.3 kpc ) .",
    "the same argument can be applied to the 26 rsmbh candidates versus the sdss qsos .",
    "if the rsmbh candidates are spatially offset , their @xmath74 will be smaller than that of the sdss qsos .",
    "the calculated mean @xmath74 are 172@xmath81 @xmath77 ( median=165 @xmath77 ) and 480@xmath82 @xmath77 ( median=435 @xmath77 ) for the rsmbh candidates and sdss qsos , respectively . indeed ,",
    "the mean @xmath74 in rsmbh candidates is only @xmath51/3 of that in sdss qsos .",
    "this could be another evidence that the rsmbh candidates are actually recoiling .",
    "we have performed a spectral decomposition to search for recoiling supermassive black hole ( rsmbh ) candidates in the sdss qsos with @xmath0 .",
    "we reported on the properties of the rsmbh candidates and on the mounting evidence that these candidates are in fact recoiling .",
    "@xmath83 out of 1271 qsos , we have identified 26 rsmbh candidates that are recoiling toward us . if we assume a similar number of rsmbhs",
    "are recoiling to opposite direction , then @xmath54% of the sdss qsos with @xmath0 are rsmbhs .    @xmath83 the projected recoil velocities of the rsmbh candidates range from @xmath1 to @xmath2 with an average of @xmath3 .",
    "the expected spatial offsets range from 0.21@xmath9  to 1.97@xmath9  ( 0.79 kpc to 3.14 kpc ) with a mean of 0.51@xmath9@xmath70.35@xmath9  ( 1.52@xmath70.59 kpc ) if we assume a random recoil direction and an agn lifetime of 10 myr for the rsmbh candidates .",
    "@xmath83 we find that the black hole mass @xmath4 of the rsmbh candidates is on average 5.2@xmath73.2 ( median=4.1 ) times smaller than that of their stationary counterparts and causes a large scatter in @xmath6 relation .",
    "* unlike stellar mass bh merging , a significant fraction of mass could be carried away by gravitational wave in the merging process of the smbhs , which could be one of the possibilities of small smbh mass of the rsmbhs . *",
    "the eddington ratio of all of the rsmbh candidates is larger than 0.1 with average of 0.52@xmath70.27 ( median=0.48 ) suggesting they are actively accreting mass .",
    "@xmath83 the possibility that agn outflows or double nuclei ( seyfert @xmath84 liner / hii ) cause the broad - line velocity offsets were examined , but we could not find strong evidences , except that the broad - line velocity offset in a few individual sources could have been originated by agn outflow .",
    "@xmath83 slopes in the velocity offset plots of h@xmath32 broad - line vs. high - excitation coronal lines suggest that the rsmbh candidates are actually recoiling .",
    "comparison of [ fe vii]@xmath696087 velocity offsets between rsmbh candidates and stationary agns suggest that the rsmbh candidates are recoiling on average velocity of @xmath71265 km s@xmath10 .",
    "@xmath83 we find that electron density in the nlr of the h ii rsmbhs is about 1/10 of that in agn rsmbhs .",
    "this can be explained if the h ii rsmbhs are more spatially offset than the agn rsmbhs under density - stratified nlr environment .",
    "the mean electron density in rsmbh candidates is found to be 1/3 of that in sdss qsos suggesting the former was more spatially offset than the latter .",
    "this can be another evidence that the rsmbh candidates are actually recoiling .",
    "as summarized above , there is much evidence to suggest that broad - line velocity offsets in rsmbh candidates are originated from recoiling smbh . to confirm this , we need evidence for spatial offset between the rsmbh and center of host galaxy .",
    "we have submitted adaptive optics imaging proposal to identify and measure spatial offset and integral - field spectroscopy to study velocity field in the rsmbh candidates .",
