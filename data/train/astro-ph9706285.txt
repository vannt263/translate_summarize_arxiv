    "this paper is part of a program aimed at increasing the number of galaxies with accurate distance determinations via ground - based multicolor ccd photometry of cepheid variables .    in the first paper of the series , capaccioli , piotto and bresolin ( 1991 , cpb ) presented new @xmath3 photometry of the cepheids belonging to the sample of variables already identified by sandage and carlson ( 1988 , sc ) in ngc 3109 . in that work",
    ", cpb derived a new zero point for the photometric scale .",
    "the new data gave a distance modulus @xmath4  mag , @xmath5% shorter than previously measured by sc .",
    "the availability of only two photometric bands ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) did not allow cpb to apply the multicolor method discussed by freedman ( 1985 , f85 ) to directly estimate the internal absorption of the cepheids in ngc  3109 .",
    "actually , bresolin , capaccioli , and piotto ( 1993 , bcp ) pointed out that the internal absorption in some of the fields studied by cpb could be greater than the adopted average value e(b - v)=0.04 .",
    "besides improving the photometry of the cepheids previously discovered on photographic plates , ccd data allow us also to obtain more accurate and deeper photometry in crowded fields , enabling the discovery of new fainter cepheids .",
    "the consequent extension of the period  luminosity relation ( @xmath8 ) to shorter periods permits a more accurate determination of its zero point .",
    "for instance , in the second paper of this series , piotto , capaccioli and pellegrini ( 1994 , pcp ) found five new cepheids in sextans a and four in sextans b , in addition to the five variables in sextans a and the three in sextans b already discovered by sandage and carlson ( 1982 , 1985 ) .",
    "the new variables extended the faint end of the @xmath8 relation of these two galaxies by one magnitude .",
    "pcp observed these two galaxies in three passbands : @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath9 , again obtaining a new zero point for the photometric calibration . using the multiwavelength photometry method ( f85 ) they derived a true distance modulus , corrected for interstellar extinction , of @xmath10 for sextans a and of @xmath11 for sextans  b , assuming a distance modulus @xmath12 for the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .    in the framework of this program , here we present a new determination of the distance to the galaxy ngc  3109 based on a new @xmath13 photometry of the cepheids located in the field f1 of bcp .",
    "the data set and the reduction procedures are illustrated in the section 2 . in section 3",
    "we present the already known variables and our 16 new cepheid candidates on which the present distance determination of ngc 3109 is based .",
    "the determination of the cepheid parameters is discussed in section 4 , while section 5 is devoted to the determination of the distance to ngc 3109 . a comparison of the pl and period - color relations for the cepheids in a few nearby galaxies is presented in section 6 . a brief discussion and a comparison with the previous determinations of the distance to ngc 3109 is in section 7 .",
    "this study is a follow up of the work by cpb . in that paper",
    "it was impossible to identify new cepheids due to the limited time coverage and small number of data points ( six at most ) .",
    "we then collected , in december 1991 , march 1992 and february 1993 , a series of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath14 , and @xmath9band images of a @xmath15 field ( fig .",

    "the set of the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath14 band images of march 1992 was obtained with the rca # 8 ccd camera at the cassegrain focus of the eso / mpi 2.2 m telescope with a ccd format of 640@xmath311024 pixels and a pixel size of @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , three @xmath6band frames at the blue arm of emmi equipped with the tektronix # 31 ccd and one in the @xmath9band at the red arm of emmi with the tektronik # 18 ccd have been collected at the eso - ntt telescope on february , 1993 .",
    "ccd dimensions is @xmath29 pixels and the pixel sizes in blue and red are @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively .    during these observing runs , at least thirteen landolt s ( 1983a",
    ", b ) standard stars were observed in each color in order to transform the instrumental photometry into the landolt standard system .    a large set of bias , dark , and flat field frames have been collected , particularly during the observing runs at the 2.2 m telescope .",
    "indeed , the columns of the high resolution eso - rca chip # 8 have not a constant bias as it depends on the total intensity of the light which falls over the column .",
    "the procedure used for the image cleaning and calibration is as in pcp and pellegrini ( 1993 ) .",
    "the ccd data have been reduced with daophot and allstar .",
    "particular attention has been devoted in tying the stellar photometry to landolt s ( 1983a , b ) standard system . for the calibration of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 colors we used the previous cpb calibration , while for the calibration of the @xmath14-band and @xmath9-band we observed 16 landolt ( 1983a , b ) standard stars in each color in december of 1991 and 13 landolt standard stars for the @xmath9 band in february of 1993 . as in piotto",
    "( 1990 ) , in order to obtain the @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 calibrated magnitudes we adopted linear color terms . for the calibration of the @xmath38 magnitudes we applied the same calibration parameters of @xmath35 , after having obtained the linear relation between @xmath35 and @xmath38 .",
    "the uncertainty on the calibration of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 photometry is @xmath39  mag .",
    "this value represents the combination of the error in the cpb calibration and of the error on the zero point difference between our photometry and that of cpb . for the @xmath14 and @xmath9 bands we obtained a zero point error in the calibration equation of 0.01 mag",
    "however , the largest error source in the calibration procedure comes from the transformation of the zero point of the point - spread - function ( psf ) fitting photometry of ngc  3109 stars into the standard star aperture photometry zero point ( cpb ) . in our frames",
    "all of the stars are distributed over a very inhomogeneous background , making the aperture photometry quite uncertain . for the @xmath9 band",
    "we have two independent calibrations ( one from the 2.2 m telescope and one from the ntt telescope ) .",
    "the average zero point differences from night to night were of 0.05 mag .",
    "the same ( average ) zero point calibration has been adopted for the two @xmath9 frames . in @xmath14",
    "we could not use the same method , since the calibration equation was available for one night only .",
    "for @xmath35 we obtained an error of @xmath40  mag on the difference between the aperture photometry and the psf fitting photometry .",
    "finally , we obtained an uncertainty of @xmath41  mag on the calibration of the @xmath38 magnitude determinations summing the error on the linear relation between @xmath35 and @xmath38 magnitudes to the calibration error of the @xmath35 calibration . throughout the paper ,",
    "whenever needed , we took into proper account the fact that the zero point calibration of @xmath35 is more accurate then the @xmath38 one .",

    ", we took into proper account that the @xmath35 magnitude determinations are more accurate then the @xmath38 ones .    in order to estimate the uncertainty associated with the mean magnitudes , we considered all the independent sources of errors acting on this quantity : the amplitude of the light curve that was converted into its equivalent variance ( see freedman et al .",

    "the resulting errors are shown in table 5 cols .",
    "6,8,10 , and 12 .",
    "recently , it has been repeatedly pointed out that the principal source of systematic errors in the calibration of the primary distance indicators is in the uncertainty in determination of the zero points of the cepheid period - luminosity and period - luminosity - color ( plc ) relations ( freedman & madore 1993 , fukugita et al .",
    "for this reason we prefer to derive the distance modulus of ngc  3109 by comparison with the large magellanic cloud cepheids , as we did in the other papers of this series ( cpb , pcp ) and as it was originally suggested by f88 .",
    "indeed the distance modulus of the lmc can be derived using several independent methods ( and owing to the large number of known cepheids in the magellanic clouds , these galaxies represent almost ideal laboratories for the calibrations of pl and plc relations ) .",
    "the method has the advantage of leaving the relative distance unaffected by whatever improvement there will be in the distance of the lmc . according to hunter & gallagher ( 1985 )",
    ", the metal content of ngc  3109 should be just @xmath51 times higher than in the lmc .",
    "therefore , we do not expect significant effects on the pl relations for the two galaxies .",
    "in fact , freedman & madore ( 1990 ) have shown that the distance moduli obtained via cepheid pl relation in a study of three fields of m31 with metal content from 0.5 to 2.5 times the solar metallicity range over less than 0.27 mag .",
    "figures [ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] , [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] present the pl relations from the mean @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath14 and @xmath9 magnitudes of the cepheids listed in table  [ table5 ] .",
    "_ filled circles _ represent both sc and our cepheids in the field f1 of ngc  3109 , while _ open circles _",
    "refer to the sc cepheids located in the other fields .",
    "_ crosses _ reproduce the photoelectric data for the lmc cepheids ( sandage 1988 , madore & freedman , 1991 ) , shifted by the zero point difference between the ngc  3109 pl relation and the lmc one .",
    "the slopes of these two relations appear similar in all four colors , in agreement with the postulate on which the use of the cepheids as distance indicators rests , i.e. that their properties are independent of the host galaxy (  also section  7 ) . for each color we built a pl relation with all the cepheids ( upper plot ) and one in which we used only the cepheids with a well defined light curve and a uniform phase coverage ( referred to as `` selected '' from here on ) .",
    "this last selection allows us to include only those cepheids with the most reliable light curve parameters as period , minimum , and mean magnitude .    in this paper , for consistency with cpb , we adopt a true distance modulus to the lmc of 18.50 mag ( van den bergh , 1996 ) mag . ] and a mean total extinction to the lmc cepheids @xmath2  mag (   discussion in cpb ) .",
    "note that bessel ( 1991 ) obtained a foreground reddening of the lmc which ranges from 0.04 to 0.09 mag , while the mean internal reddening is 0.06 mag , though in some regions it reaches values as high as 0.3 mag . in this picture , it is very difficult to estimate the mean total reddening of the sample of the lmc cepheids .",
    "as it will be discussed below , the adopted reddening for the lmc has no effect on the determination of the relative ( to the lmc ) and absolute distance modulus of ngc 3109 : it only affects the estimate of the total average reddening of its cepheids .    in order to calculate the apparent distance moduli relative to the lmc in all four bands",
    ", we obtained the best fit ( least squares method ) for the pl relation of the lmc and then we calculated the best match of the pl relation of ngc  3109 imposing the same slope of the pl relation of the lmc . for an additional internal check of our results",
    ", we repeated these calculations using different approaches .",
    "first , we considered the two different samples of cepheids in ngc  3109 defined above .",
    "moreover , while the pl relation for the lmc was fitted with a straight line over the range of periods @xmath52 are excluded from the least - squares fit since both the evolutionary status and the reddening of these longer period cepheids are controversial .",
    "] , the two samples of ngc  3109 cepheids were fitted both in the entire range of periods and in the range @xmath53 in order to minimize the effects of the faint end selection bias in the small number data set of the more distant galaxy ngc  3109 .",
    "the resulting relative distance moduli are all consistent within the errors .",
    "thus we adopted the relative distance moduli obtained with the cepheids of the selected sample of ngc  3109 without any constraint on @xmath54 . in this way",
    "we make use of the same range of periods for both the lmc and ngc  3109 , but we exclude those cepheids with inaccurate parameters which might affect the reliability of the fit ( almost all of them are in the fainter part of the pl relation ) .",
    "the resulting apparent distance moduli relative to the lmc ( @xmath55 ) are reported in the table  [ table6 ] . the total error on these apparent distance moduli",
    "is obtained adding in quadrature the error of the fit and the mean internal photometric error ( obtained for each band as a mean of the errors in table 2 up to magnitude 23.75 ) .      in order to determine the true distance modulus ( tdm=@xmath56 ) to ngc  3109 , the total ( foreground plus internal ) extinction for the cepheids must be evaluated .",

    ", the estimated errors were scaled as a function of the increasing wavelength to reflect the decreasing strip width .",
    "the solid line is the weighted least square best fit of the adopted extinction law to the moduli .",
    "following c89 , we have adopted @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the extinction in magnitudes in the @xmath7 band . with this assumption , we obtained a reddening free relative distance modulus ( rdm ) @xmath59 and a relative reddening @xmath60 between the lmc and ngc 3109 .",
    "this rdm corresponds to a tdm @xmath61 , adopting @xmath12 for the lmc .",
    "a relative color excess @xmath62 would imply a negative total mean reddening ( tr ) @xmath63 for ngc 3109 , if we assume , as discussed above and in cpb , @xmath2 for the total reddening of the lmc cepheids .",
    "a negative reddening @xmath64 has been obtained by freedman  ( 1992 ) for ngc 300 .",
    "of course , a negative reddening has no physical meaning , in terms of what we know about the interstellar medium .",
    "first , we must note that in our case the uncertainty on the @xmath65 is of the order of 0.04 magnitudes ( see below ) , and therefore we can assume that the tr is compatible with zero . still , we would remain with the unlikely situation of a _",
    "zero _ total extinction for the cepheids in ngc  3109",
    ". there might be many explanations for such a result .",
    "systematic calibration errors can play a role in the determination of the relative extinction , though we can exclude systematic errors larger than @xmath66  mag .",
    "another interesting possibility is that the intrinsic color of the cepheids in ngc  3109 is systematically bluer than those in the fiducial sample of the lmc , therefore leading to an underestimation of their reddening .",
    "however , we believe that the largest uncertainty is still on the adopted total reddening for the lmc . we have already discussed ( previous section ) the difficulties in estimating the mean internal and external extinction toward the lmc cepheids . according to bessel s ( 1991 ) results , the e(b - v)=0.08  mag for",
    "the lmc that we have adopted in this series of papers might be too low .",
    "the comparison between the lmc and ngc 3109 cepheids seems to confirm that an @xmath67  mag ( see also freedman et al . , 1991 ) or higher might be more appropriate .    the total error on the tdm of ngc  3109 is the combination of 1 ) the error on the best fit of the extinction law of c89 , 2 ) the uncertainty on the absolute distance to the lmc , 3 ) the error on the photometric zero point , and 4 ) the error due to the assumption of @xmath68 .",
    "the lmc best distance determination are based on the cepheids ( _ cf . _",
    "the compilation of feast & walker , 1987 ) , and the associated uncertainty is @xmath69  mag ; smaller errors seem too optimistic ( see van den bergh 1996 ) .",
    "this is still the dominant source of errors .",
    "the uncertainty on the zero point calibration is @xmath70 mag ( a mean of the errors estimated in sect .",
    "2 ) . finally",
    ", c89 have shown that @xmath71 can range from 2.75 to 5.3 within the galaxy .",
    "adopting this range in @xmath71 for ngc  3109 , the reddening value and the relative distance modulus would be in the interval @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "in other words , a plausible error estimates for the distance modulus as a consequence of the extinction law uncertainties is @xmath74  mag .    in summary",
    ", we have that the true distance modulus of ngc  3109 is @xmath75  mag and the total reddening is @xmath76  mag .      in the previous sections we have used the information from several photometric bands and the fit of an interstellar extinction law to the data in order to make an extrapolation to infinitely long wavelengths and estimate the total extinction and the true distance modulus .",
    "however , even without solving explicitly for the reddening , it is still possible to obtain an estimate of the distance modulus which is independent of reddening .",
    "this can be done by defining the reddening - free magnitude @xmath77 ( freedman et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] displays the @xmath78 relation for ngc  3109 ( selected sample ) and for the lmc . from this relation",
    "we obtain a true relative distance modulus @xmath79 which is consistent with the true relative modulus obtained in the previous section .",
    "the disadvantage of this reddening  free method is that the uncertainties on the @xmath80 magnitudes are larger than the single errors on the original @xmath6 and @xmath7 magnitudes , as @xmath80 results from a combination of the two .",
    "for this reason we obtain an error on the true relative modulus which is one order of magnitude larger than that on the modulus obtained by the multiwavelength method .",
    "moreover , @xmath80 depends on two of the four available colors only , making the distance based on it statistically less accurate . for this reason",
    "we have constructed a new parameter @xmath81 analog to the @xmath80 , but depending on @xmath14 and @xmath9 .",
    "the two reddening free parameters ( @xmath80 from @xmath6 and @xmath7 and @xmath81 from @xmath14 and @xmath9 ) are statistically uncorrelated and could be used as a further , independent estimate of the distance modulus .",
    "@xmath81 was derived generalizing the definition of @xmath80 , and applying it to the @xmath14 and @xmath9 bands . in fact",
    ", we can substitute the parameter @xmath71 by @xmath82 , and then define the new parameter @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath84 can be easily derived by the c89 law .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] displays the @xmath85 relation for ngc  3109 ( selected sample ) and for the lmc . from this relation",
    "we obtain a true relative distance modulus @xmath86 which is in a very good agree with that obtained from the @xmath78 relation .",
    "this result is a proof of the utility and reliability of this method .",
    "the use of both @xmath80 and @xmath81 can be used as a test of self consistency , and a way of assessing external errors .",
    "in the figs . [ fig11 ] , [ fig12 ] , and [ fig13 ] , we compare the period - color relations ( @xmath87 ) for the lmc and ngc  3109 for the three colors @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 ; for ngc  3109 the selected sample has been used ( the errors for the colors @xmath89 and @xmath90 are larger because we use the maximum expected value and represent an upper limit , see sect . 4 for details ) .",
    "in each figure , the data in the _ upper panel _ are without reddening correction and those in the _ lower panel _ are corrected according to the reddening effects .",
    "[ fig14 ] shows the same three absorption - corrected pc relations for the lmc , ngc 3109 , sextans a ( pcp ) , sextans b ( pcp ) , and ic 1613 ( f88 ) . the slopes of these pc relations are the same , within the uncertainties .",
    "the data of ngc  3109 , sextans a , sextans b , and ic 1613 have a larger scatter than for the lmc , consistent with the lower accuracy in the determination of the mean magnitudes .    in order to obtain the zero point difference between the pc relations for the lmc and the other galaxies ,",
    "the lmc pc relations were fitted with a straight line over the range of periods @xmath91 , and a linear fit of the pc relations was performed for the other galaxies imposing the same slope of the lmc . in this way",
    "we could calculate the mean color difference between the cepheids in the lmc and in the other four galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig15 ] shows that the mean color difference after the reddening corrections is consistent with zero .",
    "this result shows that , if we suppose that the colors of the cepheids are independent of the parent galaxy , the law by c89 allows to calculate relative reddenings in a consistent way .    with the data set presented in this paper",
    ", we can check whether the cepheids in ngc  3109 have the same average colors as in the lmc .",
    "figure [ fig16 ] displays the reddening ",
    "free parameter @xmath92(v - i)$ ] as a function of @xmath93 for both the selected sample of cepheids in ngc  3109 ( _ filled circles _ ) and in the lmc ( _ crosses _ ) ( see freedman , 1992 ) .",
    "the slopes of the two distributions are the same as well as the zero point .",
    "the larger scatter for the ngc  3109 cepheids is consistent with the larger photometric errors .",
    "the similarity of these two distributions suggest that the colors of the cepheids in these galaxies are the same .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] we compare the amplitude of the @xmath6 light curves of the cepheids in ngc  3109 and in the lmc .",
    "also in this case we obtain that the trend and the dispersion of the points for the two populations of cepheids are similar , suggesting similar properties .",
    "in conclusion , an extended pl relation and the multicolor photometry provide a new , more accurate , de - reddened distance of ngc 3109 relative to the lmc . adopting @xmath12 for the lmc",
    ", we obtain a true distance modulus @xmath94 for ngc 3109 ; if we assume a reddening e(b - v)=0.08 for the lmc , the total reddening of the cepheids in ngc  3109 is @xmath95 .",
    "the new reddening free distance modulus corresponds to @xmath1 mpc .",
    "this new distance is consistent , within the errors , with the value @xmath96 given by cpb , though , formally , now ngc 3109 is placed @xmath97 further away . it is instructive to inspect the origin of this difference . in cpb",
    "we had only b and v - band data .",
    "it was difficult to apply the multiwavelength method to this data set , in view of the closeness of the two bands and of the poor coverage in the v band .",
    "for this reason , cpb preferred to adopt a mean reddening e(b - v)=0.04 for ngc 3109 and estimate the true distance modulus with this assumption in mind .",
    "the reddening estimate ( from burstein & heiles , 1992 ) contour maps was admittedly poor ( as noted also by bpc ) .",
    "the difference between the reddening adopted by cpb and the present direct estimate of the mean reddening toward ngc 3109 completely explains the difference in the final absolute modulus . as further evidence",
    ", we can refer to the exercise presented by piotto et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , where we used the two b and v apparent relative distance moduli of ngc 3109 for a rough estimate of the true relative distance moduli with the multiwavelength method applied also in the present paper . even with a poorer data set piotto et al .",
    "( 1995 , cf .",
    "their fig .",
    "2 ) obtained a true relative distance modulus @xmath98 , much closer to the present estimate .",
    "this discussion shows by itself the importance of extending the cepheid light curves to the largest possible wavelength interval .",
    "for this reason , we are observing these same cepheids of ngc  3109 in the jhk bands .",
    "we expect to reduce the error in the distance and reddening estimate . for the importance of the jhk observations of cepheids ,",
    "see madore and freedman ( 1991 )    finally , we want to briefly comment on the similarity of _",
    "( i ) _ the slopes of the cepheid pl and pc relations , _ ( ii ) _ the average color , and _ ( iii ) _ of the properties of the amplitude - period relations which result from a direct comparison of the data from five galaxies ( cf .",
    "discussion in section 5.1 , and 6 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fundamental assumption on which the entire extragalactic distance scale stands .",
    "however , we must also point out the large uncertainties still present in the determination of all the above parameters (   also the discussion in section 5.2 ) , in part as a consequence of the nature of this kind of research , which requires a huge amount of telescope time .",
    "it is clear that the dispersion ( intrinsic and as a consequence of the observational uncertainties ) of the relations presented in figs .",
    "4 - 7 , and in figs .",
    "11 - 17 are too large for a firm conclusion on the universality of the cepheid properties .",
    "a lot of work on the theoretical and observational side is still needed .",
    "in particular , we must take advantage of the recent improvement in the near - ir detectors , where the pl and plc relations are much narrower .",
