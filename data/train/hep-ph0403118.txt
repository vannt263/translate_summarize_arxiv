    "although some appreciable progress has been made in _ ab initio _ calculations of low - lying baryon resonances within the lattice gauge approach , still the only comprehensive description of the complete known spectrum of hadrons ( focussing on light quark flavours ) with masses up to 3 gev , which addresses such issues as linear regge - trajectories , parity doublets in the baryon spectrum , the conspicuous structure of scalar excitations of hadrons , is in fact the constituent quark model , which assumes that the majority of meson and baryon excitations can be effectively described as @xmath0 and @xmath1 bound states of ( constituent ) quarks and that the coupling to more complicated configurations ( such as strong decay channels ) can be treated perturbatively . although recent experimental findings hint at the existence of exotic meson and baryon resonances , this scheme at least constitutes a framework to judge what is to be considered as exotic .    since quarks , even when adopting constituent , effective quark masses , move in hadrons with velocities which are a significant fraction of the velocity of light and most non - static observables involve processes at rather large momentum transfers , the quark model description should be based on the usual concepts of quantum field theories . in spite of this",
    ", traditionally the quark dynamics in quantitative constituent quark models has been formulated on the basis of the non - relativistic schroedinger equation and relativistic corrections have at best been parameterized .",
    "recent calculations on electromagnetic form factors elucidated the role of poincare invariance in calculating electromagnetic currents .",
    "the ultimate goal of any hadron model is to obtain a unified description of    * mass spectra of ( _ e.g. _ light - flavoured ) hadrons from the ground states up to the highest masses < 3 gev and highest angular momenta @xmath2 observed , addressing such isuues as : regge - trajectories , scalar excitations , ( pseudo)scalar mixings ( for mesons ) , parity doublets ( for baryons ) , undetected resonances , etc .",

    "strong ( two - body ) decays and interactions .    even within the framework of the constituent quark model , the various approaches found in the literature",
    "do not only differ appreciably with respect to there scope , but also in the modelling of the effective quark interactions used and in the assumptions concerning the dynamical equations . here",
    "we can distinguish between ( a ) field theoretical approaches , which implement relativistic covariance in the basic set - up , such as : lattice - gauge theory of qcd , dyson - schwinger / bethe - salpeter approaches relying on a parametrization of the infrared gluon propagator , see _",
    "@xcite , instantaneous approximations to this , on the basis of a parametrization of confinement and using instanton - induced interactions , which allows for addressing the complete light - flavoured hadron spectrum and not merely the ground and some lower excited states and ( b ) quantum mechanical approaches on the basis of the schrdinger equation with relativistic corrections using confinement potentials and effective quark interactions based ( alternatively ) on o(ne ) g(luon ) e(xchange ) , see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite or g(oldstone ) b(oson ) e(xhange ) , see _",
    "e.g. _  @xcite .",
    "here dirac s instant , point or front formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics is invoked to subsequently calculate various currents .",
    "in the following we will sketch the various assumptions and approximations made in constituent quark models by focussing on mesons : adopting the framework of quantum field theory mesons are described as bound @xmath0 states with @xmath3 , described by the bethe - salpeter amplitude @xmath4    mutually determine the full propagators for the fermions and exchange bosons and the dressed vertex functions involved . in practise one truncates this set of equations by making an _ ansatz _ for some @xmath5-point function and solving the equations ( bethe - salpeter - equation ( bse ) for two particles or the dyson - schwinger - equation ( dse ) for the self - energy ) of lower order .",
    "in particular , based on an effective gluon propagator with a specific infrared behaviour this leads to the renormalization - group - improved rainbow - ladder approach  @xcite , of which we will quote some interesting results . in a simplified _ ansatz _ one can refrain from solving the dse and assume that the fermion propagator has the free form @xmath6^{-1}$ ] and to account for the self - energy contributions by introducing a constituent mass @xmath7 . furthermore one could assume that the irreducible interaction kernel is given by a single gluon exchange ( oge ) in coulomb gauge , possibly with a running coupling , where a coulomb part of the interaction is instantaneous , and thus in the no - retardation limit @xmath8 arrive at an instantaneous oge  potential .",
    "such instantaneous interaction kernels allow for a parametrization of confinement by a string - like potential and , defining the salpeter - amplitude as @xmath9 , one then arrives at the salpeter - equation ( instantaneous bethe - salpeter equation ) @xmath10          \\gamma^0 \\lambda_2^+(-\\vec p)}{m+\\omega_1+\\omega_2 } \\nonumber \\\\          & - & \\int \\frac{d^3 p}{(2\\pi)^3 } \\frac {          \\lambda_1^+(\\vec p ) \\gamma^0 [ v(\\vec p,\\vec p')\\phi(\\vec p ' ) ]          \\gamma^0 \\lambda_2 ^ -(-\\vec p)}{m-\\omega_1-\\omega_2}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the projectors @xmath11 , the dirac hamiltonian @xmath12 and where @xmath13 .",
    "if one now drops the first term on the r.h.s . of eq.([eqn :",
    "sal ] ) one arrives at the reduced salpeter - equation , which then has the from of a schrdinger equation with relativistic kinetic energy and relativistic corrections to the potential ( contained in @xmath14 ) .",
    "this can be considered the starting point of virtually all `` relativized '' constituent quark models",
    ".    pioneering work in this spirit was performed already almost two decades ago by the group around nathan isgur both for mesons , see  @xcite , and later on for baryons , see  @xcite and references therein . here",
    "it was assumed that the quark interactions in hadrons can effectively be described by a linear confinement potential and spin - dependent parts of one gluon exchange ; relativistic effects in the interactions were accounted for by parametrizations .",
    "this also holds for the description of annihilation contributions to pseudoscalar mixings .",
    "the scope of the calculation e.g. for mesons is a unified description of all resonances , both with light and with heavy flavours , and also includes a calculation of a multitude of electroweak and strong decay observables , which in spite of the more than a dozen model parameters can still be considered as rather efficient .",
    "on the other hand one can also take the full salpeter equation as a starting point for constituent quark model calculations : here the instantaneous interaction kernel consists of the fourier transform of a string - like linearly rising confinement potential with an appropriate dirac structure which avoids large spin - orbit splittings , supplemented by a spin - flavour dependent interaction motivated by instanton effects , see @xcite .",
    "the latter has the decisive advantageous property to incorporate the @xmath15 anomaly quantitatively and thus to account immediately for the splitting and mixing of ( pseudo)scalar mesons . the total number of parameters in this approach amount to seven . as an example a comparison of the isoscalar mass spectrum for two versions of the confinement potential ( model @xmath16 and model @xmath17 employing confinement dirac structures @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively ) with experimental data and the results from the calculation of godfrey and isgur is given in fig .",
    "[ metsch : fig : one ] .    - and @xmath20 wave isoscalar mesons . from left to right each column ( of fixed spin @xmath21 , parity @xmath22 and charge parity @xmath23 ) displays the results from the godfrey - isgur relativized calculation  , the experimental resonance position with a box indicating the error , and two versions of the relativistic calculation on the basis of the salpeter equation with instanton - induced forces  . ]",
    "apart from the scalar sector the results are rather similar . while the relativized quark model calculation resort to the rather _ ad hoc _ mock - meson method , in the field theoretical approaches based on the bethe - salpeter equation the calculation of decay amplitudes in the mandelstam - formalism is straightforward and parameter free , albeit numerically tedious .",
    "a comparison of the results for pseudoscalar decay constants is given in table  [ metsch : tab : one ] ,    .pseudoscalar decay constants in [ mev ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in conclusion we think that we have demonstrated , that constituent quark models provide a very useful tool in understanding hadron properties in a unified way : this not only involves a description of the mere mass spectrum , but also numerous decay amplitudes and electroweak ( transition ) form factors .",
    "in particular the field theoretical approaches which rely on the description of bound states of quarks through coupled bethe - salpeter/ dyson - schwinger equations have provided very interesting results , unfortunately so far only for the ground states and some low - lying excited states . in this respect the approach based on the instantaneous bethe - salpeter equation , using free - form fermion propagators with constituent masses , implementing confinement by a string - like linearly rising potential and with instanton - induced interactions to explain the spin - dependent mass splittings seems to be a very efficient compromise combining the advantages of a relativistically covariant field theoretical treatment with the successful concepts of the ( non - relativistic ) constituent quark model . adopting the point form of dirac s relativistic quantum mechanics does improve the description of observables within the latter category drastically , and supports the main findings of our treatment that a relativistic treatment of decay amplitudes , especially for processes at higher momentum transfers is absolutely imperative .",
