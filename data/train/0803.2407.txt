    "event - by - event fluctuations of intensive quantities like temperature , reflected in the mean transverse momentum @xmath6 of hadrons , have been proposed as a possible signature for critical phenomena connected with the passage of the system through the phase boundary , and may therefore constitute an independent probe to pin down the properties of the qcd phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "fluctuations of the mean transverse momentum are associated to the heat capacity of the system , which has a maximum at the qcd phase boundary . as a conseqence",
    ", transverse momentum fluctuations in the final state could be suppressed if the system retains its memory from the phase transition . on the other hand , long - range correlations associated with the vicinity of the system to the qcd critical point",
    "may lead to an enhancement of transverse momentum fluctuations .",
    "recent measurements of event - by - event fluctuations of the mean transverse momentum at sps and rhic demonstrated a clear excess beyond the statistical expectation  @xcite .",
    "different regions of the qcd phase diagram have been probed by variation of experimental control parameters , such as beam energy and system size .",
    "it was argued that passage of the system through the critical point or the phase boundary would be signaled by a sudden change of the fluctuation pattern .",
    "while the energy dependence turned out to be structureless within the sps and rhic energy regime , a characteristic centrality and system size dependence has been observed , exhibiting a non - monotonic behaviour with a maximum at system sizes corresponding to about 100 - 150 participating nucleons .",
    "however , a strong connection of these findings to critical behaviour in the vicinity of the phase transition has not yet been made .",
    "this inconclusive result is partially caused by the difficulty to identify and disentangle various contributions to the different fluctuation measures .",
    "while the implications of finite number statistics are well under control , there are a number of sources of correlations on different transverse momentum scales , which are expected to contribute to the fluctuation measures , such as quantum statistics , final state interactions , collective flow , resonance decays or jet fragmentation .",
    "typically , the sensitivity to these contributions is tested with the help of monte - carlo studies .    in this paper , we follow a novel approach by studying the scale - dependence of transverse momentum correlations .",
    "the aim is to identify and separate different sources of correlations by a differential , scale - dependent analysis of the two - particle correlation pattern .",
    "a similar approach to a scale - dependent correlation analysis has been followed at rhic , using different variables and an elaborated inversion technique  @xcite .",

    "the mean transverse momentum @xmath10 of event @xmath11 with @xmath12 charged particles is defined as @xmath13 as a measure for event - by - event fluctuations , we employ the dynamical fluctuation @xmath14  @xcite that is derived from the variance of the inclusive single track @xmath3 distribution @xmath15 , the variance of the event - by - event mean transverse momentum distribution @xmath16 and the average number @xmath17 of charged particles per event : @xmath18 for the calculation of the variance @xmath16 , the mean transverse momentum @xmath10 of each event @xmath11 has been weighted by the number of tracks @xmath12 in this event .",
    "the dynamical fluctuation @xmath14 is zero by definition if all fluctuations are purely statistical . for convenience ,",
    "the normalized dynamical fluctuation @xmath19 is introduced  @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the inclusive mean transverse momentum of all tracks from all events .",
    "the measure @xmath19 is dimensionless and specifies the dynamical contribution to event - by - event @xmath6 fluctuations in units of @xmath21 . for the case of independent particle emission from a single parent distribution , @xmath19 vanishes .",
    "most of the previous studies of @xmath6 fluctuations have been performed in a scale - independent way , integrating over all short- and long - range contributions present in the detector acceptance .",

    ", an additional measure will be introduced .",
    "the occurence of non - statistical fluctuations of @xmath6 goes along with correlations among the transverse momenta of particles .",
    "such correlations can be calculated employing the two - particle transverse momentum correlator  @xcite : @xmath22 as for the measures defined earlier , @xmath23 can be calculated for distinct classes of tracks after application of single track cuts , like cuts on @xmath3 , pseudorapidity or charge sign . in this case , the number of pairs in event @xmath11 is given by @xmath24 , where @xmath12 is the number of particles of a given class in event @xmath11 , and @xmath23 is approximately equal to @xmath14 .",
    "since @xmath23 is a particle pair observable , it is possible to apply cuts on the pair level , contrary to the situation for the measures introduced above .",
    "an example is the study of @xmath3 correlations between particles of different charge sign . in this case , the correlator is calculated in the following way : @xmath25 moreover , it is also possible to study the scale dependence of @xmath3 correlations in angular space by calculating the correlator in bins of the angular separation @xmath26 of particle pairs : @xmath27 in this case , only particle pairs with a given @xmath26 contribute to the correlator sum .",
    "the ceres experiment at the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) has been designed for the study of electron - pair production at mid - rapidity in hadronic and nuclear collisions . by the addition of a cylindrical time projection chamber ( tpc ) and a new magnet system in 1998 , the momentum resolution of the spectrometer was significantly improved  @xcite . moreover",
    ", the excellent tracking capability of the tpc for charged particles provides the opportunity to study also hadronic observables .",

    ", the read - out plane is subdivided into 16 read - out chambers , arranged along the polygon - like outer perimeter of the tpc .",
    "efficiency losses occur predominantly for tracks which cross between two adjacent read - out chambers .",
    "the tpc is operated inside an inhomogenous magnetic field with a radial component of up to 0.75  t. by the measurement of its deflection , the momentum of a charged particle can be reconstructed with a resolution of @xmath31(gev/@xmath1 )  @xcite .    in the year 2000 , a sample of @xmath32 central ( @xmath33 ) and about @xmath34 minimum bias pb - au events have been recorded .",

    "we use charged particles reconstructed in the tpc in the kinematic range @xmath38 and @xmath39  gev/@xmath1 .",
    "a minimum of 12 detected hits per track is required to provide sufficient momentum resolution .",
    "background from decays and conversions is suppressed by the requirement that the back - extrapolation of the tpc tracks into the target plane should not miss the interaction point by more than 10  cm in transverse direction .    in the scale - independent analysis , the measures @xmath14 , @xmath9 , and @xmath23 have been calculated for positive and negative particles separately , as well as without charge selection .",
    "in addition , transverse momentum correlations between particles with opposite charge sign are analyzed employing the measure @xmath40 .",

    "a decrease of @xmath21 by a few percent as function of pseudorapidity is observed .",
    "the decrease can be explained by the kinematical acceptance of the tpc , combined with a pseudorapidity - dependent proton - to - pion ratio .",
    "this has been verified by a monte - carlo simulation . in azimuth ,",
    "the 16-fold structure of the tpc read - out plane is visible .",
    "this effect arises as a consequence of efficiency losses in the vicinity of the gaps between adjacent read - out chambers . in detail ,",
    "efficency losses depend on the curvature of the track , hence giving rise to local variations of @xmath21 .",
    "if a correlation analysis is performed in bins of relative angular space , such variations lead to trivial ( anti- ) correlations of transverse momenta as function of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "a correction of the final results for these correlations can be obtained by a mixed - event procedure .",
    "pairs of particles from different events are free of correlations except those arising from the single particle acceptance of the detector .",

    "the observed variations are small .",
    "this is expected from the high frequency pattern in fig.[fig1 ] ( right panel ) : by averaging over all combinations , correlations and anti - correlations cancel to a large extent . in fig.[fig2 ] , only a residual structure of the read - out plane segmentation is visible , showing up as a weak repetitive pattern in azimuthal direction .",

    "the situation is different in @xmath47 . due to the monotonic decrease of @xmath21 as function of pseudorapidity , pairs are preferentially correlated at small @xmath47 and anti - correlated at large @xmath47 .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig.[fig2 ] , where a significant monotonic decrease of the correlator as function of @xmath47 can be observed .",
    "the momentum correlator has been calculated for mixed - event pairs as function of @xmath47 and @xmath46 and for all possible charge combinations .",
    "these results have been subtracted bin - wise from the corresponding results of the same - event analyses presented below .",
    "it should be noted that , in scale - independent analyses of the momentum correlator , correlations due to the single track @xmath3 acceptance cancel .",
