    "at present , we know three type ii cepheids which are components of short - period binary systems .",
    "they are tx del ( the orbital period of 133 days ) , ix cas ( 110 days ) ( harris & welch , 1989 ) , and au peg ( 53.3 days ) ( vink et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "the binary separations in these systems are near the possible minimum for the size of a type ii cepheid .",
    "tidal forces influence the pulsating components of such systems , and it is even possible that their pulsations are excited by tidal effects ( harris et al . , 1984 ) .",
    "the orbital inclination of these binary systems relative to the terrestrial observer does not make them eclipsing .",
    "three long period eclipsing binary systems with type i or ii cepheid components have been discovered in the large magellanic cloud by ogle and macho microlensing photometry programs ( udalski et al . , 1999 ;",
    "alcock et al . , 2002 ; lepischak et al . ,",
    "the importance of search for cepheids  members of eclipsing binaries is considerable .",
    "if an eclipsing binary is a double - line system , then mass , radius , and luminosity of the components can be directly determined from the analysis of the light and radial velocity curves .",
    "this gives us an opportunity to investigate the structure and evolution of cepheids , to test the theories of pulsation and to calibrate independently the scale of distances and the hubble constant ( guinan et al . , 2005 ; guinan & engle , 2006 ) .    in the past",
    ", bm cas was considered a candidate eclipsing binary with a cepheid component in the galaxy , but detailed investigation by fernie & evans ( 1997 ) revealed that out - of - eclipse light variations were non - periodic , inconsistent with the cepheid classification .    in this paper , we announce the discovery and present our ccd photometry of the first eclipsing type ii cepheid in the galaxy  a component of the binary with the shortest orbital period among similar systems .",
    "the variability of tyc  1031  01262  1 = asas 182611 + 1212.6 ( @xmath0 = 18261150 , @xmath1 = + 1212348 , j2000.0 ) was discovered several years ago in the asas-3 survey ( pojmaski et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "the variability was independently discovered by the authors on moscow archive plates taken with the 40-cm astrograph in crimea .",
    "the photographic phased light curve based on 120 eye estimates is given in fig .  1 .",
    "moreover , observations of tyc  1031  01262  1 are contained in the nsvs database ( woniak et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "in all the three cases , the data permit us to consider the new variable as a cepheid with some peculiarity that is rather similar to multiperiodicity of unknown nature .",
    "however , the available data did not allow us to completely explain the observed light variations .",
    "for this reason , we started observations of the star in 2004 with the 50-cm maksutov telescope of the crimean laboratory ( sternberg astronomical institute ) equipped with a pictor  416xte ccd camera and johnson @xmath2 filter .",
    "the observations continued for three years : 729 images on 17 nights in 2004 ( july 429 , jd2453191216 ) , 560 images on 13 nights in 2005 ( july 119 , jd2453553571 ) , and additional 367 images on 24 nights in 2006 ( july 4  august 2 , jd2453921950 ) were obtained .",
    "the images were dark subtracted , flat - fielded and analyzed with the aperture photometry software @xmath3 developed by v.p .",
    "the comparison stars are marked in fig.2 . to improve the accuracy of our photometry and to evaluate uncertainties , we used two comparison stars and averaged the obtained differential magnitudes having in mind that @xmath4 .",
    "the accuracy of our photometry is about 0017 .",
    "the data is available upon request .",
    "combination of our results with the asas-3 data permits us to propose a suitable explanation of the variations observed for tyc  1031  01262  1 .",
    "note that we ( 1 ) used the asas-3 observations taken from the official web site of the project _ before _ the 2006 raid problem , ( 2 )  made use of the third of the five columns of asas-3 data which corresponds to the aperture 4 pixels in diameter , and ( 3 )  assumed @xmath5 to make our @xmath2-band observations agree with the asas-3 ones .    -band image ( @xmath6 ) of the field of tyc  1031  01262  1 .",
    "the comparison stars are marked.,width=313 ]    figure 3 shows the suggested solution of the observed variability of tyc  1031  01262  1 .",
    "cepheid oscillations with the elements @xmath7 dominate in the light curve .",
    "then the data were whitened for pulsations and we found that the residuals could be well described by an eclipsing ( eb - subtype ) curve with the following light elements : @xmath8 the photographic and nsvs observations do not contradict the proposed interpretation .",
    "however , in these cases , the eclipsing light curves after whitening the data for pulsations are rather noisy .     band .",
    "the asas-3 data are shown as crosses ; the filled circles are our ccd observations .",
    "the averaged phased light curves that have been used for whitening to make the other periodicity evident are plotted as solid curves.,width=313 ]",
    "tyc 1031 01262 1 is definitely a type ii cepheid . using the @xmath9-band period - luminosity relations for galactic classical cepheids by berdnikov et al .",
    "( 1996 ) : @xmath10 @xmath11 ( from the 2mass catalogue ) and the galactic latitude @xmath12 , considering that extinction in @xmath9 band is not significant ( less than 0.05 mag for the variable ) , we can estimate the distance from the galactic plane as @xmath13 kpc , in contradiction with the dcep classification .",
    "note that even in the case of extinction being actually large the last conclusion will not change .",
    "for now , we have the following multi - colour photometry of the system : @xmath14 and @xmath15 from tycho-2 catalogue ( hg et al . , 2000 ) ; average @xmath16 and @xmath17 from tass observations ( droege et al . , 2006 ) ;",
    "@xmath18 from asas-3 data ; @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 taken on jd 2451613.0243 ( from 2mass , cutri et al . ,",
    "the colours do not differ noticeably from those of a single type ii cepheid .",
    "direct spectroscopy is required to determine the spectral types of the components .",
    "our detection of eclipses and observations solely in the @xmath2 filter are only the first step in the investigation of this unique system .",
    "it is necessary to continue observations of the variable star , carry out multi - colour photometry and spectroscopy to confirm the derived orbital period in radial - velocity variations and to determine parameters of the binary system .",
    "the most similar , non - eclipsing binary system with a cepheid component , au  peg , shows a considerably larger amplitude of the orbital radial velocity variation than that for the pulsations , @xmath22 km / s versus the pulsational semi - amplitude of about 13  km / s ( samus et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "we can expect a similar situation in the case of tyc  1031  01262  1 .",
    "judging from their small amplitude , the eclipses are partial , and therefore , the eclipse depth must depend on the cepheid s radius , i.e. on the phase of the pulsation period .",
    "this effect is slightly noticeable in our observations , but it must be confirmed and studied in detail by subsequent photometry .",
    "moreover , we would like to turn the reader s attention to the fact that the eclipsing light curve being of the @xmath23  lyrae type gives us reasons to believe that the components are ellipsoidal .",
    "it seems interesting to study how non - spherical cepheids pulsate .",
    "tyc  1031  01262  1 gives a rare opportunity to learn it .",
