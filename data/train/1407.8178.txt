    "we use primarily the distinctive property of a rotating disk - like structure that objects on opposing sides have anti - correlated velocities .",
    "the expectation from observations of m31 is that any such structures are superposed on a `` contaminating '' population of `` normal '' satellites which appear , to first approximation , to have a spherically symmetric distribution around the host .",
    "the presence of such a contaminating population , together with the fact that most galaxies beyond the local group have only a small number of satellites with well - measured velocities , means that at present we can only test for the alignments in a statistical manner on a sample of hosts .",

    "this naturally suggests using a test that makes use of the resulting elongation .",
    "however , we can bias a sample towards being more edge - on by selecting those systems with satellites that have radial velocities significantly different from their host galaxy .",

    ", we determine whether another satellite lies on the opposite side of the host within a tolerance angle @xmath7 .",
    "if both satellites possess a velocity that is significantly different from that of their host , the pair is retained for study .",
    "motivated by the galaxy velocity uncertainties in the sdss , we selected this minimum velocity difference parameter to be @xmath48 in all calculations presented here ( the results are qualitatively very similar for @xmath49 ) .    to explore how the method works ,",
    "we constructed first a very simple test configuration , containing 50% of satellites in a spherical population , and 50% in a disk - like structure .",
    "both structures were populated with satellites with uniform probability between @xmath50 and @xmath1 .",
    "the satellites in the disk rotate at @xmath51 , independent of radius , while the spherical population has an isotropic velocity dispersion of @xmath52 .",
    "this toy model is then viewed from a random direction , and two satellites are selected at random beyond a projected radius of @xmath50 . if the two satellites lie on opposite sides of the host to within the chosen tolerance angle , and if both satellites have a velocity difference with respect to their host of more than @xmath53 , the pair is retained , and we count whether the velocities are correlated or anti - correlated .",

    "1b show the ratio of the number of anti - correlated to correlated pairs as a function of the tolerance angle @xmath7 .",
    "as this simple model shows , we expect the highest contrast to be found at small tolerance angles .",
    "the selection on diametrically opposite galaxies together with the minimum velocity criterion ensures that close to edge - on configurations are preferentially selected ; for this toy model , the average inclination angle for the @xmath54 sample is @xmath55 .",
    "in order to explore further the reliability of our method to uncover genuine planar satellite alignments , we decided to construct artificial galaxy systems that we could run and test our algorithm on .",
    "for this purpose the millennium ii simulation ( in particular with the semi - analytic modelling by guo et al.@xcite ) provides an ideal view of the expected distribution of galaxies and their satellites in a very large ( @xmath56 ) volume in a @xmath8cdm universe .",
    "the catalogue lists the absolute r - band magnitudes , total galaxy masses , positions and velocities that are necessary for our comparison to observations .    to create the random views of galaxies derived from the simulation we proceed as follows .",
    "we first choose a random direction from which we will view the galaxies in the millennium ii volume .",
    "a list of candidate host galaxies is generated by selecting those objects with absolute magnitudes in the range @xmath11 ( identical to the selection on the real sdss data presented in the main text ) .",
    "we examine each of the candidate hosts in turn , placing the host to be studied at @xmath57 ( the mean velocity of the sdss sample ) , and then making sure that it appears isolated in projection with no brighter neighbour within @xmath58 , with velocity differences less than @xmath10 .",
    "we make a list of all the neighbouring galaxies within a projected distance of @xmath9 and a velocity of @xmath10 that are at least one magnitude fainter than the host , but that are brighter than @xmath15 ; we will refer to these objects as `` satellites '' .",
    "( we reject so - called `` orphan '' galaxies which are systems whose parent subhalo is no longer resolved in the millennium ii simulation  but as figs 1b and 1c show , our results remain qualitatively identical if these objects are included ) . for each host",
    "we then randomly draw a vector to define the normal to the planar population , and we go through the list of satellites randomly assigning them to the planar population , according to the desired planar component fraction that we wish to test for .",
    "clearly , when testing for a planar fraction of zero , the millennium ii positions and velocities remain unaltered . for those satellites that are assigned thus to the planar component",
    ", we keep the galactocentric distance that they had in the millennium ii simulation , but place them onto the plane with a random azimuthal angle .",
    "the space velocities of the planar satellites are devised to give circular motions in the plane of the alignment , with the total velocity chosen from the circular velocity of a universal halo model@xcite of total mass given by the virial mass of the host .",
    "a gaussian random velocity of @xmath59 ( a representative value for the sdss velocity errors ) is added to the radial velocity of the host and all its satellites .",
    "having thus reordered the three - dimensional positions of some of the satellites , we filter the sample to keep those objects that lie at projected distances in the range @xmath60 , and that have velocity difference of less than @xmath18\\kms$ ] with respect to the host ( extended data fig .",
    "the brightest two satellites within the @xmath60 annulus are selected for study .",
    "if the two satellites lie on opposite sides of the host to within the chosen tolerance angle , and if both satellites have a velocity difference with respect to their host of more than @xmath53 , the pair is retained , and we count whether the velocities are correlated or anti - correlated .",
    "the entire process is then repeated for all other candidate hosts .",
    "we rerun the entire procedure , selecting new initial viewing angles , as many times as necessary until a total of 2000 satellite pairs have been generated .",
    "with the parameter selections detailed in the text , and setting @xmath48 , there are 380 galaxy systems in the sdss . using @xmath21 , we find @xmath61 pairs to have anti - correlated velocities , and @xmath62 to have correlated velocities , i.e. @xmath63% of all pairs are found with this tolerance angle . with the unaltered millennium ii simulation ( 0% in a disk )",
    "we find 4.7% of pairs with @xmath21 ; this fraction rises to 4.9% with a 50% disk component , and to 6.7% with a 100% disk component .",
    "this suggests that the fraction of satellites in a planar component within the sdss is greater than 50% , consistent with the estimate given in the text , but the simplicity of the disk model for the planar component prevents us from drawing strong conclusions from this comparison .",

    "<S> the complications due to spatial incompleteness of satellite samples that complicate analyses in the milky way are largely alleviated when observing the next nearest giant galaxy , andromeda ( m31 ) . </S>",

    "<S> the satellites in the plane extend to @xmath5 , yet they display very small scatter in the direction perpendicular to the plane ( @xmath6 ) , and they also possess coherent kinematics , suggestive of common rotation about their host . </S>",
    "<S> recent analyses have also uncovered possible galaxy alignments in the m81 system@xcite , and in the ngc  3109 association . </S>",
    "<S> such satellite alignments may arise naturally if dwarf galaxies formed out of tidal debris left over by ancient galaxy mergers@xcite , but this scenario remains difficult to reconcile with the high dark matter content deduced for these objects@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the reality of the planar structures in the local group is now firmly established , they may represent a fossil of the particular dynamical formation history of the milky way and andromeda systems@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore necessary to investigate more distant systems to ascertain the true significance of these local detections .    </S>",
    "<S> we devised a test ( methods ) to quantify the incidence of planar systems of satellites . </S>",
    "<S> beyond a few mpc , reliable and accurate relative distance measurements are inaccessible ; this means that one has to deal with two - dimensional projections of galactic systems , possessing only the radial component of velocity . </S>",

    "<S> half of that system shows coherent rotation , which means that for orientations that are not exactly face - on , satellites on either side of the galaxy as seen on the sky will in general have opposite velocities relative to the host ( i.e. the velocities of the satellites will be anti - correlated ) . </S>",
    "<S> this motivates the following simple detection method : for each satellite around a given host , we check whether it possesses a counterpart that is located on the opposite side of the galaxy to within a certain tolerance angle @xmath7 ( sketch in fig . </S>",

    "<S> . clearly , with circular orbits , no contamination and perfect data , all pairs will be anti - correlated if they all belong to co - rotating planes .    as a control , we first applied this test to the large millennium ii simulation ( ms2 ) of structure formation and evolution@xcite , which reflects our best theories of galaxy formation in @xmath8 cold dark matter ( @xmath8cdm ) cosmology@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that diametrically opposite pairs of bright satellites selected from that simulation ( methods ) show no kinematic coherence , with roughly equal numbers of correlated and anti - correlated pairs for all @xmath7 ( filled circles in fig . </S>",

    "<S> 1c shows the anti - correlation of the satellite pairs as a function of the dominance of planar configurations ; evidently a measure in real galaxies of the fraction of anti - correlated pairs has the potential to reveal whether planar satellite alignments are common .    </S>",
    "<S> we therefore applied this test to the sdss , which currently gives the most complete view of the nearby universe . since we wish to investigate the environment around galaxies similar to the milky way and andromeda , we select from the `` nyu value - added galaxy catalog''@xcite isolated host galaxies ( no brighter neighbour within a distance of @xmath9 and within a velocity difference of @xmath10 ) with magnitudes in the range @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> cosmological parameters from the planck mission are assumed@xcite . to ensure a clean sample of satellites , we select hosts up to a redshift @xmath12 ( beyond this , few faint satellites are detected ) , remove hosts closer than @xmath13 to avoid noisy measurements , and remove all galaxies with velocity uncertainties greater than @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the satellites themselves are any galaxy one magnitude or more fainter than the host , but brighter than @xmath15 , within the radial range @xmath16 ( again to be similar to the m31 analysis@xcite ) . </S>",

    "<S> we retain only those satellites whose direction of motion with respect to their hosts is well - resolved ; since we imposed an upper velocity uncertainty of @xmath14 for both hosts and satellites , we require a minimum velocity difference of @xmath19 . </S>",

    "<S> various choices for @xmath7 are examined in fig . </S>",

    "<S> 1b ) , the highest contrast between anti - correlated and correlated satellite pairs should be found for small @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> there is an inevitable trade - off between the number of satellite pairs that pass the selection criteria and the contamination fraction suffered by the sample . </S>",
    "<S> strict selection gives good contrast , but poor statistics ; lenient selection gives poor contrast , but good statistics . </S>",
    "<S> optimal significance will therefore lie at an intermediate tolerance angle , but given the unknown density and kinematic properties of both the normal and putative disk - like satellite populations , we believe the best strategy is to allow the data themselves to guide our choice of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a shows that with @xmath21 , 20 out of 22 pairs are anti - correlated , implying 99.994% ( @xmath22 ) significance ; these systems are listed in table 1 . </S>",

    "<S> high significance is found out to @xmath24 , although as expected in the presence of non - planar `` contaminants '' , the significance decreases with increasing @xmath7 . by comparison to the simulations where a disk population was added to ms2 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1c ) , the observed ratio of anti - correlated to correlated pairs ( @xmath25 at 99% confidence ) at @xmath21 suggests that a fraction of @xmath26% of satellites reside in planes , although we stress that this constraint is weak as this disk model is simplistic . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have found that the average giant galaxy in the sdss is consistent with our m31 template . while the sdss spectroscopic observing strategy produced certain spatial biasses@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it seems extremely improbable that such biasses could artificially cause an over - abundance of anti - correlated satellite pairs as found here .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 highlights a possible correlation between the direction defined by the satellite alignment and the large - scale structure surrounding the hosts . </S>",
    "<S> an elongated overdensity of galaxies appears aligned along the axis of the satellite pair , extending out to @xmath27 times the distance of the selected pair ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a , b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with what we see in the local group , where the m31 satellite alignment points within @xmath28 of the milky way . although these filaments are much thicker than the planes around galaxies , it is possible that this reveals the influence of large scale structures on the dynamics of the smaller satellite system . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in ms2 the larger - scale environment around anti - correlated pairs shows no strong preferential direction , and neither does the environment around sdss correlated pairs ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3c ) . </S>",
    "<S> while it remains possible that the large - scale elongation of the galaxy distribution along the direction of the galaxy pairs is an artefact of the sdss target selection , this seems unlikely given the random orientation of the satellite pairs on the sky .    </S>",
    "<S> table 1 also lists the angular momentum of the satellite pairs , calculated using the projected distance , line of sight velocity and estimated stellar masses@xcite of these galaxies . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> , the total angular momentum of our galaxy in stars is @xmath29 ( approximating it as an exponential disk@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the angular momentum contained in the stellar component of the aligned satellites we have identified ( mean of the @xmath21 sample : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a sign flag explained in table  1 ) is comparable to the angular momentum in a giant galaxy s stellar disk . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that these coherent structures make a significant contribution to the angular momentum budget on galaxy halo scales ( @xmath4 ) , although a better understanding of their incidence and physical properties is required to quantify their importance .    </S>",
    "<S> our tests were constructed using ms2 as a control sample to predict what should have been a priori expected in @xmath8cdm cosmology . just as this paradigm did not predict the planes observed in the local group@xcite , it did not a priori predict the velocity correlations presented here </S>",
    "<S> . it should be noted , however , that ms2 contains only dark matter , and future large cosmological simulations that include detailed baryonic physics should be performed to see if the discrepancies can be alleviated . while it is as yet uncertain whether the pairs of satellites detected here actually form part of kinematically coherent planes , their velocity anti - correlation , alignment with larger scale structures , and high angular momentum are all unexpected properties of the universe that will require explanation . </S>"
