    "in the present paper we introduce the notion of @xmath2braids as well as their generalization : groups of @xmath3braids for any arbitrary group @xmath1 .",
    "they form a natural group  theoretical analog of @xmath3knots , first introduced by the second author in @xcite .",
    "those objects naturally generalize the classical ( artin ) braids .",
    "@xmath3braids have a natural structure : every classical crossing of a braid is decorated with an element of @xmath1 .",
    "we also give another presentation of the group of @xmath2braids ( and even of a broader group ) where the information about the group elements is contained in the braid strands .",
    "that leads one to the notion of dotted braids : classical ( artin ) braids live inside the dotted braids group , being braids with a diagram with no dots on the strands .",
    "a similar object is defined : twisted dotted braids .    in theories dealing with additional structures on objects diagrams ( say , parity , dots , group structures ) an important role",
    "is played by the theorems of the following form : _ if two objects are equivalent as objects with an additional structure ( hence with a broader set of moves allowed ) then they are equivalent as objects without this structure_. an example of this kind of theorems is given by the theorem on classical braids being equivalent as virtual yielding their equivalence as classical ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "there are two theorems of that type in the present paper . the first one deals with classical braids being equivalent as @xmath2braids and the second",
    " with @xmath2braids equivalent as dotted braids . in both cases the equivalence can be `` descended '' to a smaller class of braids with a smaller set of allowed moves .",
    "virtual braids as well as virtual knots possess many nice properties which lead to powerful invariants ( see @xcite ) .",
    "as it has been recently found ( see @xcite ) , picture  valued invariants appear in the case of classical braids by using groups @xmath4 .    thus , a natural question arises : are there any models representing virtual braid groups inside classical braid groups ? certainly , if we do not admit further modifications , the answer will be negative since classical braid groups have no torsion .",
    "the present paper is a first step of understanding the above mentioned question by introducing the idea of parity into the study of classical braids .",
    "a list of unsolved problems is given in the present paper .",
    "first let us recall the definition of a _",
    "@xmath5stand braid_. there exists several ( equivalent ) definitions ; we will formulate the one we will be using in the paper .",
    "the @xmath5strand braids group is a group given by @xmath6 generators @xmath7 and the following set of relations : @xmath8 for all @xmath9 ( far commutativity ) and @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "this set of relations is called the _",
    "artin relations_.    in other words , the braid group elements are the equivalence classes of words in the alphabet @xmath12 modulo the above  mentioned relations .",
    "such words are also called _ braid ",
    "words_.    the definition of braids via the artin presentation can easily be interpreted geometrically . to this end",
    "the notion of a _ flat diagram _ of a braid is introduced .",
    "flat diagram of a @xmath5strand braid is a graph inside a rectangle @xmath13 $ ] with the following additional structure and properties :    1 .",
    "the graph vertices of valency 1 are the points @xmath14 $ ] and @xmath15 $ ] , @xmath16 .",
    "2 .   all other vertices are of valency four .",
    "the opposite edges in such vertices are at the angle of 180 degrees .",
    "the braid strands monotonously go down with respect to the coordinate @xmath17 .",
    "every four  valent vertex is decorated with a `` overcrossing  undercrossing '' structure .",
    "two diagrams are considered equal if they can be connected by a chain of flat isotopies ( with the condition of the strands always being monotonously going down ) , second and third reidemeister moves .    .",
    "]    now , for the generators @xmath18 of the braid group take the braids of the following form : @xmath18 for @xmath19 consists of @xmath20 intervals connecting the points @xmath21 $ ] with @xmath22 $ ] for all @xmath23 and two intervals @xmath14-[i+1,1],\\ , [ i+1,0]-[i,1]$ ] such that the latter goes over the former ( see fig . [ generators ] ) . for the inverse element",
    "@xmath24 we take the same braid but with the crossing structure in the only crossing reversed ( see fig .",
    "[ inverse ] ) .",
    "it can be easily seen that the existence of the inverse is exactly the invariance under the second reidemeister move , the relation ( [ raid3 ] )  the third reidemeister move , and the far commutativity can be understood as the commutativity of the crossings with no mutual strands .    . ]",
    "now let us define a new object : @xmath2briads or _ braids with parity _ ( see @xcite ) . from now on we will use the algebraic definition but keep in mind that there is always an underlying geometric object , probably with an additional structure .",
    "the @xmath5strand @xmath2braid group is a group with generators @xmath25 @xmath26 and the following set of relations : @xmath27 for all @xmath9 and all @xmath28 ( far commutativity ) and @xmath29 where @xmath11 and @xmath30 .",
    "we will call the @xmath31 generators _ even _ and the @xmath32 ones  _ odd_. the @xmath5strand @xmath2braids group will be denoted by @xmath33 .    from the geometric point of view",
    "this definition means an additional structure ( `` parity '' ) being introduced in the braid crossings .",
    "the parity is such that every two crossings in a second reidemeister move are both even or both odd and among the three crossing in the third move either two or zero are odd .",
    "when working with objects with additional structure which are related to objects with no such structure one should keep in mind the following important principle : _ if two objects are equivalent as objects with additional structure ( and thus with a broader set of moves and equivalences allowed ) they are equivalent as objects without the structure ( therefore connected with a chain of moves from a smaller set)_. in case of classical and @xmath2braids this principle is true . in other words ,",
    "the following theorem holds :    [ classic_in_2 ] if two braids without odd crossings are equivalent as @xmath2braids , they are equivalent in the class of the braids with no odd crossings ( even braids ) .    to prove this fact we need a lemma relating @xmath2braids with virtual braids .",
    "let us recall the definition of virtual braids :    the @xmath5strand virtual braids group is a group with @xmath6 generators @xmath7 and @xmath6 generators @xmath34 and the following set of relations : @xmath35 for all @xmath9 ( far commutativity ) and @xmath36 for @xmath11 ; @xmath37 for all @xmath9 ( far virtual commutativity ) and @xmath38 for @xmath11 , @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 for all @xmath9 .",
    "the virtual braid group will be denoted with @xmath42 .",
    "[ virt ] there exists a homomorphism from the the group @xmath33 into the virtual braid group @xmath42 .",
    "consider the following mapping from the group of @xmath2braids to virtual braids : @xmath43 in other words , every odd crossing is sent to a virtual crossing .    an elementary check shows that ( due to the parity properties ) the mapping is well defined : if two elements of the group @xmath33 are equal , their images are also equal as the elements of the group @xmath42 .    note , that this mapping does nt provide us with a homomorphic _ inclusion _ of virtual braids into @xmath2braids .",
    "the inverse mapping , sending @xmath18 to @xmath31 and @xmath44 to @xmath32 is `` bad '' since the image of the third virtual reidemeister moves ( with all crossings being virtual ) in @xmath2braids is not an allowed move and a square of an odd generator is not trivial , while @xmath45 in virtual braids .",
    "let us now prove theorem [ classic_in_2 ] .",
    "consider two classical braids @xmath46 such that their images in @xmath33 @xmath47 are equal .",
    "let us show that the braids @xmath48 are equal as classical braids .",
    "since the braids @xmath47 are equal , they are connected by a chain of moves : second and third reidemeister moves with certain conditions on the parity of the crossings involved . due to lemma [ virt ]",
    "their images in the virtual braid group are also equal .",
    "but it is well known ( see for example @xcite ) that if two classical braids are equal as virtual , they are equal as classical .",
    "therefore @xmath48 are equal in the class of classical braids and the proof is concluded .",
    "the idea of endowing a crossing with an additional structure can be generalized in the following manner .",
    "let @xmath1 be an arbitrary group .",
    "let us define the @xmath3braid group .",
    "the @xmath5strand @xmath3braid group is a group with generators @xmath49 @xmath50 and the following set of relations : @xmath51 for all @xmath9 and all @xmath52 ( far commutativity ) and @xmath53 for @xmath11 and @xmath54 ; here @xmath55 means the neutral element in the group @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ raid3_g ] ) .    braid . ]",
    "we shall say that a braid diagram _ admits a source  sink structure _ if there exists such an orientation of its graph edges that for every four  valent vertex two opposite edges are incoming and two are outcoming . from the geometric point of view",
    "the @xmath3braid structure means the decoration of every crossing with an element of the group @xmath1 with the condition that the product of the elements in every lune and triangle , written according to the source  sink structure , equals the neutral element in @xmath1 .",
    "as an example consider the group @xmath0 . in that case",
    "the inverse for any element is the element itself , so for every three labels @xmath56 corresponding to to the crossings in the third reidemeister move , we have @xmath57 . in other words ,",
    "exactly two or zero of those labels are all equal to 1",
    ".    therefore we see , that the group @xmath58 is isomorphic @xmath33 .",
    "note , that in case of , say , virtual braids the source  sink structure is not always admitted . therefore the definition of @xmath3braids ca nt be given verbatim and requires additional considerations .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to define analogous constructions in the virtual case , not unlike the @xmath3knots and virtual @xmath3knots ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to remember , though , that such object requires caution in the definition of what products of group elements , attributed to the crossings , equals the group neutral element .",
    "the parity structure , introduced in the crossings , can be reimagined as a parity on edges .",
    "this approach broadens the class of considered objects : given a diagram with a parity in the crossings one can define a diagram with a parity ( dots ) on the edges .",
    "the inverse procedure is not alway well defined .",
    "nevertheless , the class of dotted diagrams such that there exists a corresponding diagram with parity , is invariant under the moves ; moreover , the moves on the dotted diagrams allow the recovery of the moves on the diagrams with a parity .",
    "the @xmath5strand dotted braid group is a group with the generators @xmath7 , generators @xmath59 and the following set of relations : @xmath60 for all @xmath9 ( far commutativity ) and @xmath61 for @xmath11 ; @xmath62 for all @xmath16 , @xmath63 for all @xmath64 , @xmath65 for all @xmath66 .",
    "this construction can be visualized as follows .",
    "the generators @xmath18 have the same geometric meaning as before . the generators @xmath67 can be represented as a trivial braid on @xmath68 strands with a dot on the @xmath69th strand .",
    "the relation ( [ dot_square ] ) means that two consecutive dots cancel each other ; dots on different strands commute ( see the relation ( [ dot_commute ] ) ) ; finally , a crossing with four dots around equals a crossing without dots ( see the relation ( [ four_dots ] ) ) .",
    "denote the dotted braid group with @xmath70 .",
    "this group is quite large .",
    "for example , one has the following    the group @xmath33 can be homomorphically included into the group @xmath70 .",
    "consider the following mapping @xmath71 @xmath72 this mapping is well defined and is a homomorphism to a subgroup of @xmath70 .",
    "it is well defined due to the fact that , thanks to the ( [ four_dots ] ) relation , any lune or triangle , considered in the second or the third reidemeister move , can be transformed into a lune or triangle without dots for which a usual reidemeister move can be used ; after that the dots are returned in the same manner ( see fig .",
    "[ o2 ] , [ o3 ] ) . here",
    "we extensively use the structure of the group @xmath73 .",
    "now we need to introduce the notion of _ good _ dotted braids .",
    "a dotted braid is called _ good _ if its every strand has even number of dots .",
    "now we can define the inverse homomorphism : from good dotted braids to braids with parity .",
    "consider a good braid @xmath74 and its arbitrary diagram .",
    "we present a well defined way to assign a parity to every crossing of the diagram .",
    "every crossings breaks two strands into four `` half  strands '' .",
    "half _ is two right ( or two left ) half  strands together .",
    "note , that since the braid is good , the parity of the number of dots on either halves is the same . that is the parity we attribute to the crossing considered .",
    "it is easily verified , that this mapping is well defined .    that completes the proof .",
    "geometrically speaking , we send odd crossings to the crossings with two dots on the different halves of the upper strand .",
    "note , that such parity is a global property : a dot can be `` taken far away '' via the dot moves , but the crossing remains odd .",
    "that is exactly the difference between dotted braids and , say , @xmath3braids : in the latter the additional information is positioned in the crossings hence local .",
    "the following important fact holds true :    if two @xmath2braids are equal as dotted braids , they are equal as @xmath2braids .",
    "consider two @xmath2braids @xmath75 equal as dotted braids : their images under the mapping @xmath76 , defined above , can be connected by a chain of moves allowed for the group @xmath70 .",
    "the braid @xmath77 is a good dotted braid .",
    "as was seen above , dotted braid moves on good braids do nt change the parity of its crossings .",
    "therefore , at each step of the transformation the braid remains good hence  a braid with parity .",
    "moreover , the @xmath2images are also connected by the corresponding move . therefore , the theorem is proved .",
    "one can use the dot idea to get different interesting groups . let us present another example .    in virtual braids , unlike the classical ones , there is a torsion . to approach realisation of virtual braids with classical ones with an additional structure",
    "we introduce the notion of _ twisted dotted braid group _",
    ":    the @xmath5strand twisted dotted braid group is a group with the generators @xmath7 , generators @xmath59 and the following set of relations : @xmath60 for all @xmath9 ( far commutativity ) and @xmath61 for @xmath11 ; @xmath78 for all @xmath16 , @xmath79 for all @xmath64 , @xmath80 for all @xmath66 .",
    "this group differs from the dotted braid group only in the last relation : four dots not preserve but invert a crossing .",
    "this group will be denoted with @xmath81 .",
    "the following is true :    the group @xmath82 homomorphically includes into the group @xmath81 .",

    "let us show that it is well defined .",
    "the triangle ( third reidemeister move ) case is considered exactly as before .",
    "but here we need to prove that the following equality holds : @xmath83 in other words , a lune with two odd crossings of the same structure can be acted upon with the second reidemeister move .",
    "that is true due to the `` twisting '' relation ( [ four_dots ] ) , see fig .",
    "the theorem is proved .",
    "the group @xmath82 `` almost '' realises the virtual braid group by sending even crossings to classical and odd to virtual .",
    "the only move absent in this group is the third reidemeister move with three virtual crossings .",

    ") admit natural operations of _ projection , covering , bracket , cobracket ( delta ) _ ( see , say , @xcite ) . for example , the knots whose vertices are naturally marked by elements from @xmath84 can be naturally covered with two component links : even crossings correspond to selfcrossings of a component and the odd ones  to the crossings of different link components .",
    "+ a question arises : is there an inclusion of the above  defined groups ( @xmath33 , @xmath70 and others , as well as their analogs ) into the classical braid group @xmath85 for a sufficiently large number of strands @xmath86 ? if that is the case , the problem of conjugation can be solved , exact linear presentations of virtual braid groups can be constructed .",
