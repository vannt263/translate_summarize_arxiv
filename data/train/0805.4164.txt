    "time multiplexing is extremely challenging using current qm protocols such as stopped light based on electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , photon echoes based on controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening ( crib ) @xcite or off - resonant raman interactions @xcite . for a single mode , @xmath1 , the efficiency as a function of optical absorption depth @xmath2 is similar for eit , crib , and raman - type memories @xcite .",
    "for multi - mode storage using eit and raman , however , @xmath0 scales as @xmath3 @xcite , which severely limits the number of potential modes in a practical experiment , while crib offers a better scaling since @xmath4 @xcite .",

    "we present a qm , where the number of potential modes is essentially independent of the optical depth .",

    "the qm is based on absorption of light by an ensemble of atoms on an optical transition which is inhomogeneously broadened .",
    "ensembles are in general very attractive as qms due to strong collective enhancement of the light - matter coupling @xcite .",
    "storage of single photons using eit ( stopped light ) has been demonstrated with cold alkali atoms @xcite which can be treated as homogeneous ensembles of identical atoms . here",
    "we will instead consider ensembles of rare - earth - metal ( re ) ions in solids , which are inhomogeneously broadened",
    ". stopped light with storage times up to 1 s has been demonstrated in re - doped solids @xcite , where an approximate homogeneous ensemble was created by spectrally isolating a narrow absorption peak through optical pumping .",
    "in contrast to this approach , the quantum memory proposed here uses the inhomogeneous broadening as a resource in order to achieve better multi - mode performance . for that one",
    "needs to coherently control the dephasing which is caused by the inhomogeneous frequency distribution of the atoms .",
    "the key feature of our proposal is to achieve this control by a specific shaping of this distribution into an atomic frequency comb .",
    "the article is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii we give an overview of the proposal using a simplified physical picture . in section",
    "iii we show results from an analytical analysis of the physics of atomic frequency combs , which is further detailed in the appendix . in section iv the multi - mode storage capacity is discussed , and in sec .",

    "the states @xmath6 and @xmath7 are typically ground - state hyperfine or zeeman states .",
    "we assume that the optical transition @xmath8 has a narrow homogeneous linewidth @xmath9 and a large inhomogeneous broadening @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this is the case for re - doped solids that we will consider for physical implementation in sec . v. the @xmath8 transition",
    "is spectrally shaped such that the atomic density function consists of a series of narrow peaks spanning a large frequency range ( atomic frequency comb , or afc ) .",
    "this can be done by frequency - selectively transferring atoms from @xmath6 to a metastable state @xmath12 , for instance a third hyperfine state , through optical pumping techniques ( see sec .",
    "v ) . note that the maximum spectral width of the afc is limited by the level spacings between the ground state levels .",
    "we then consider a single - photon input field , having a spectral distribution @xmath13 larger than the afc peak separation @xmath14 , but narrower than the total width of the afc @xmath15 , which is in resonance with the @xmath8 transition .",
    "if the atomic density integrated over the photon bandwidth is high enough the photon can be totally absorbed by the afc , although the spectral density of atoms is concentrated to narrow peaks .",

    ", the optical transition will have an uncertainty of the order of @xmath17 .",

    "the state is described by a collective dicke state @xcite    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the position of atom @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the wave - number of the light field ( for simplicity , we only consider a single spatial mode defined by the direction of propagation of the input field ) , @xmath28 the detuning of the atom with respect to the laser frequency and the amplitudes @xmath29 depend on the frequency and on the spatial position of the particular atom @xmath26 .",
    "the collective state can be understood as a coherent excitation of a large number of afc modes by a single photon .",
    "these modes are initially ( at @xmath30 ) in phase with respect to the spatial mode @xmath27 .",
    "but the collective state will rapidly dephase into a non - collective state that does not lead to a strong collective emission , since each term acquires a phase @xmath31 depending on the detuning @xmath28 of each excited atom .",
    "if we consider an afc having very sharp peaks , then the detunings @xmath28 are approximately a discrete set such that @xmath32 , where @xmath33 are integers .",
    "it follows that the collective state is re - established after a time @xmath20 , which leads to a coherent photon - echo @xcite type re - emission in the forward direction . the efficiency of this process ( see sec .",
    "iii for details ) can reach 54@xmath34 in the forward direction ( limited only by re - absorption ) .",
    "but if the re - emission is forced to propagate in the backward direction , by a proper phase matching operation ( see below ) , the process can reach 100@xmath34 efficiency .",
    "the process described so far only implements a qm with a fixed storage time . in order to allow for",
    "on - demand read - out of the stored field ( which is a necessary requirement for use in quantum repeaters ) and long - term storage , the single collective excitation in @xmath5 is transferred to a ground state spin level @xmath7 .",
    "this can be done by applying an optical control field on @xmath21 , for instance a short @xmath35 pulse .",
    "the excitation is thereafter stored as a collective spin wave , which is also the basis of storage in eit , crib , and off - resonant raman type memories based on ensembles of lambda atoms @xcite .",
    "the spin wave allows for long - lived storage since spin coherence lifetimes are generally longer than the optical coherence lifetimes .",
    "moreover , the spin transition does not have a comb structure @xcite , which means that the evolution of the phases in eq .",
    "( [ dicke ] ) will be locked during the storage in the spin wave . if we assume that the spin transition is completely homogeneous the storage time is only limited by the coherence lifetime of the spin wave .",
    "if there is inhomogeneous broadening , spin echo techniques can be used to exploit the homogeneous coherence lifetime of the system ( see sec .",
    "v ) . to retrieve the field a second counter - propagating control field",
    "is applied after some time @xmath22 .",
    "these operations will result in a backward propagating output mode after a total time @xmath36 . as we will show below , the efficiency of the storage for backward retrieval can theoretically approach unity for high optical depths .",
    "we will now discuss some important features of the afc and give quantitative formulas relating the input field to the output field as a function of the afc parameters .",
    "this can be used to calculate , for instance , storage efficiency .",
    "to this end we have used an approximate , linearized maxwell - bloch ( mb ) model .",
    "a linearized model can be used since the population in the excited state is negligible . for a single photon input field at most one atom in the ensemble is excited . for multi - mode storage , the number of totally excited atoms should be much less than the total number of atoms , which is the case for the number modes we consider and the re - solids we discuss in sec .",
    "v. the linearity of the analytical model also implies the equivalence between classical and single - photon dynamics @xcite .",
    "the important features of the model is discussed below , while the details of the calculations are given in the appendix .",
    "the matter part was assumed to be an ensemble of two - level atoms , including levels @xmath6 and @xmath5 in fig .",
    "[ fig_prot ] , and the light field was treated as a one - dimensional spatial mode .",
    "this model can fully describe the mapping of light onto the atoms , the atomic evolution including the inhomogeneous dephasing and rephasing of the afc modes , and the re - emission of light .",
    "the model did not include population relaxation ( @xmath37 ) or decoherence ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "this is a valid approximation since the peaks in the afc are assumed to be inhomogeneously broadened",
    ". then all relevant dephasing times are much faster than @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( as in the example given in sec .",
    "v ) . in practice , however , the width of the individual peaks will be limited by the homogeneous linewidth @xmath39 .",
    "the two counter - propagating control fields were modelled by transferring the forward atomic mode , associated with the forward propagating optical mode , to a backward atomic mode @xcite .",
    "this achieves the phase matching operation that results in a backward propagating optical mode .",
    "clearly this approach assumes that the transfer efficiency of the control pulses is unity and that the spin transition @xmath40 is decoherence free .",
    "we thus only analytically treat the physics of the atomic frequency comb , which is the novel feature of this protocol as compared to previous quantum memory proposals @xcite . the transfer efficiency and spin decoherence could",
    ", however , be straightforwardly included with appropriate loss factors .",
    "the equations of motion describing the light - matter dynamics is given in the appendix ( see eqs ( [ em_1])-([em_4 ] ) ) .",
    "in addition to the analytical calculations , we also show results from numerical solutions of the mb model .    the atomic spectral distribution @xmath41 is a frequency comb described by a series of gaussian functions characterized by the peak separation @xmath14 and peak width @xmath42 , with an overall comb width of @xmath15    @xmath43    the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) peak width is then @xmath44 , and we define the finesse @xmath45 of the comb as @xmath46 .",
    "we are interested in the regime where we have a significant number of well - separated peaks within the overall characteristic width of the afc .",
    "moreover , we assume that the spectrum of the photon is narrower than the width of the afc , but wider than the peak separation , i.e. @xmath47 .    in order to have an efficient memory , the probability of absorption of the input mode must be sufficiently high .",
    "but to create a high finesse afc atoms are removed , by optical pumping , from the natural inhomogeneous spectrum .",
    "this preparation step lowers the total density of atoms and hence the probability of absorption .",
    "the analytical calculations show that the amplitude of the forward propagating mode @xmath48 after the sample of length @xmath49 is given by ( see eqs ( [ ef])-([eff_d ] ) )    @xmath50    where the effective absorption depth @xmath51 can be expressed as    @xmath52    the comb absorption is thus reduced by a factor of @xmath53 , which is to be expected since the total density of atoms in the comb ( integrated over the frequency bandwidth of the photon ) is reduced by a factor of @xmath53 in the preparation step .",
    "but if the peak absorption depth @xmath2 of the comb is high enough , the total density of atoms in the comb can still be sufficiently high to absorb the input mode with close to 100@xmath34 probability .",
    "an interesting feature of the afc is that it can absorb uniformly over the frequency spectrum of the input mode although the atomic frequency comb has large `` holes '' .",
    "this can be understood by considering that the absorption is an event well localized in time , of the order @xmath54 . in that case",
    "the light - atom system reacts with a fourier - limited resolution @xmath13 , which effectively smears out the structure of the afc to an essentially flat distribution ( see discussion preceeding eq . ( [ ef_diff ] ) ) . in other words",
    "the peak separation @xmath14 must be smaller than the photon bandwidth @xmath13 .",
    "this also implies that eq .",
    "( [ el ] ) is only valid for times @xmath55 , i.e. before the appearance of the first emission due to rephasing of modes in the comb .    by applying the two counter - propagating control fields , the spatial phase pattern of the atomic polarization changes such that it couples with the backward propagating field mode @xcite . under the assumption of unit transfer efficiency and no phase decoherence during the transfer to or storage in @xmath7",

    "even though there is absorption also along the path of the backward mode , a constructive interference effect between all these possible paths leads to the output amplitude potentially being arbitrarily close in magnitude to the input amplitude for large enough @xmath2 .",
    "this interference effect is also present in the crib quantum memory scheme for backward retrieval @xcite .",

    "( [ eq_d ] ) , whereas the third factor takes into account dephasing due to the finite width of the peaks .",
    "the dephasing factor can be understood by considering the dephasing during the storage in the optically excited state @xmath5 . in the qualitative description in sec .",
    "ii we assumed that each peak was a delta function , which leads to complete rephasing of the collective state eq .",
    "( [ dicke ] ) . clearly finite gaussian peaks will not lead to complete rephasing , which lowers the probability of re - emission .",
    "the decay of the re - emitted field amplitude is given by the fourier - transform of a peak in the comb ( see eq .",

    "( [ eq_eff ] ) ( see fig . [ fig_eff_f ] ) .",

    "this will occur if no control fields are applied or if the control fields are applied co - propagating . as is shown in the appendix ( see eq .",
    "( [ e_out_fw ] ) ) , this re - emission is limited in efficiency to 54@xmath34 for an optimal optical depth of @xmath70 .",
    "the optimum represents a trade - off between strong light - matter coupling ( favoring high optical depth ) and re - absorption of the re - emitted light as it propagates through the sample ( favoring low optical depth ) .",
    "the excellent multi - mode properties of the afc based qm can be understood qualitatively as follows .",
    "we imagine that the input is a series of temporally distinguishable modes containing , with a certain probability , a single photon in each mode .",
    "the storage efficiency is uniform over all the modes , since each mode spends the same time in the memory .",
    "note that the effect of spin decoherence is also the same on each mode .",
    "if the control fields are applied as late as possible , the total duration of the input can be close to @xmath71 , the time it takes to rephase the first mode that was absorbed .",
    "the shortest duration @xmath72 of one mode , however , is only limited by the total frequency bandwidth @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the number of peaks in the comb .",
    "the number of modes @xmath75 is then proportional to @xmath74 , such that adding more peaks in the afc allows one to store more modes .",
    "thus , in materials with inherently large inhomogeneous broadenings ( see sec .",
    "v ) one can increase the multi - mode capacity by making use of a wider range of the inhomogeneous broadening , without having to increase the peak absorption depth by , for instance , increasing the atomic density in the sample .",
    "we can make a more detailed calculation of the multi - mode capacity by assuming that the input modes have gaussian temporal shapes , where each mode occupies a temporal slot of duration @xmath72 .",
    "it is important that the modes do not overlap too much , which in the end would produce errors .",
    "the amount of overlap that can be accepted depends on the particular application . in ref .",
    "@xcite an analysis of the error due to overlap was carried out in the context of a quantum repeater protocol in which the afc qm could be used .",
    "there it was shown that @xmath72 should be chosen as @xmath76 , where @xmath15 is the total memory bandwidth ( note that here @xmath15 is expressed in radians ) , where the width @xmath15 is taken to be that of a square distribution , as in ref .",
    "this also guarantees that the spectral content of the input modes can be fitted inside the afc , which in turn results in negligible temporal distortion of the output modes .",
    "the width @xmath15 can be related to the number of afc peaks @xmath77 .",
    "the total duration @xmath78 of the input is @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the time necessary for applying the two control fields . in the limit where @xmath81 , we have @xmath82 .",
    "the number of total temporal modes then amounts to @xmath83 .",
    "the number of peaks that can be created will depend strongly on the inhomogeneous @xmath10 and homogeneous @xmath9 linewidths of the material .",
    "the width of each peak can not be narrower than the homogeneous linewidth , i.e. @xmath84 . since an efficient memory ( @xmath85 ) requires a finesse @xmath86 , it follows that @xmath87 .",
    "the number of peaks will depend on the ratio of the maximum afc bandwidth @xmath15 to the peak separation @xmath14 .",
    "the bandwidth will ultimately be limited by the inhomogeneous broadening of the material . in most materials , however , it will instead be limited by hyperfine or zeeman transition spacings in order to avoid exciting multiple transitions that would induce quantum beat effects . in section v we will give a detailed example where the number of peaks is of the order of hundreds with known material parameters .",
    "the afc qm dramatically reduces the necessary absorption depth for multi - mode storage as compared to crib or eit qms , since the multi - mode capacity is independent of the peak absorption depth of the material . for crib",
    ", @xmath88 is required for storing @xmath0 modes with an average efficiency of 90@xmath34 @xcite , so for instance @xmath0 = 100 requires @xmath2 = 3000 . in the case of eit",
    "even larger @xmath2 would be necessary due to the worse scaling as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the afc only requires @xmath89 to reach the same efficiency , independently of @xmath0 .",
    "this makes efficient multi - mode qms more realistic with current material properties , as we will discuss in the next section .",
    "as storage material we here consider re - doped crystals , which have inherently large inhomogeneous broadenings ( 0.1 - 10 ghz ) and very narrow homogenenous linewidths ( 0.1 - 100 khz ) at low temperatures ( typically less than 4 k ) @xcite .",
    "note that the typical homogeneous linewidths correspond to optical coherence times ranging from @xmath90s to ms .",
    "still re ensembles have relatively high absorption coefficients at normal doping concentrations ( 10 - 100 ppm ) , typically in the range 1 - 40 @xmath91 . re crystals",

    "briefly , a large transmission hole is first created by spectral hole burning on the optical transition while sweeping the laser frequency .",
    "the pumped atoms are stored in another hyperfine level with long population lifetime .",
    "a narrow ensemble of atoms is then created in the hole by repumping atoms from the storage state to the initial state using a highly coherent laser source @xcite . by repumping at different frequencies",
    "this method can be extended in order to create a series of peaks .",
    "one can also use other techniques in order to achieve frequency - selective optical pumping .",
    "for instance , one can use pairs of coherent pulses where each pair coherently transfers atoms to the excited state via a ramsey interference @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations show that by accumulating many pairs , narrow , periodic structures can be created .",
    "this time - domain approach is interesting because in principle a time sequence can be created which has the appropriate frequency spectrum for creating an afc with a certain finesse . moreover a time - domain approach can be used for creating more complicated structures in frequency space , for instance multiple afcs having different periodicity .",

    "the pair of @xmath35 pulses , which are used for storing the excitations in a long - lived ground state and then bringing them back to the excited state , also have the effect of changing the phase pattern of the atomic polarization from forward ( @xmath140 ) to backward ( @xmath141 ) , such that it now couples to the backward field @xmath142 , cf .",
