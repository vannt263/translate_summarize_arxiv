    "the lyman-@xmath0  forest , caused by ly@xmath0  absorption of neutral hydrogen atoms along the line of sight to some distant source ( usually a quasar ) , was originally described in terms of discrete intervening gas `` clouds '' @xcite , analogous to clouds in the galactic interstellar medium . in this picture , the velocity widths of the observed absorption structures were primarily a consequence of thermal motions of the absorbing atoms . in the mid-1990s , three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmological models achieved remarkable success in reproducing the observed properties of the ly@xmath0  forest @xcite . in these simulations ,",
    "most of the absorbing gas is at low density ( @xmath610 ) and naturally described as a continuously fluctuating medium rather than a series of discrete structures @xcite .",
    "the velocity width of individual features is set largely by the hubble flow across them , reflecting the physical extent of the absorbing gas along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , therefore , affects the structure of the ly@xmath0forest in two ways : by smoothing absorption along the line of sight through the thermal motions of atoms , and by smoothing the physical distribution of the gas in three dimensions through pressure support . in this study",
    ", we use two smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations with different photoionization heating rates  and thus different igm temperatures and amounts of gas pressure support  to disentangle the relative effects of pressure support and thermal broadening in the ly@xmath0  forest .    both hydrodynamical simulations",
    "@xcite and analytic arguments @xcite suggest that low - density intergalactic gas should have a power - law temperature - density relation , i.e. , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the local gas overdensity .",
    "reasonable assumptions for heating and cooling rates yield @xmath9k and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "observations , however , imply that the normalization @xmath11 could be nearly twice as high , and the slope could be much shallower or even inverted @xcite . regardless of the parameter values , because the optical depth to ly@xmath0  absorption is related to both the temperature and the density by a power law , the existence of the temperature - density relation ( also called the `` equation of state '' ) implies a tight relation between the observed ly@xmath0  absorption and the igm gas density .",
    "since the universe has @xmath12 times as much mass in dark matter as in baryons , we can expect in general for intergalactic gas to trace the underlying dark matter on scales above the gas jeans length @xcite .",
    "the ly@xmath0  forest therefore provides a powerful tool for tracing the dark matter power spectrum in the quasi - linear regime ",
    "modulo the effects of peculiar velocities , thermal broadening , and gas pressure @xcite .",
    "pressure should be important on scales at or below the jeans length , @xmath13 where @xmath14/[3m]}=\\sigma_{\\rm th}\\sqrt{5/3}$ ] is the speed of sound in an ideal gas expressed as a multiple of the 1-d thermal velocity @xmath15 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath16 is the average mass of the gas particle ; in an ionized primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the proton mass .",
    "the density @xmath19 is the density of the gravitating medium , which is dominated by dark matter , so we take @xmath20 . in comoving coordinates , @xmath21^{-1/2}\\nonumber\\\\   & = & 782\\,h^{-1}\\,\\mbox{kpc}\\\\   & \\times & \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{\\rm   th}}{11.8\\,\\rm{km}\\,\\rm{s}^{-1}}\\right)\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{m,0}(1+\\delta)}{0.25\\times(1 + 0)}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1+z}{1 + 3}\\right)\\right]^{-1/2 } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have normalized the thermal broadening velocity @xmath22 to correspond to a fiducial temperature of @xmath23k . by defining a `` jeans velocity '' as @xmath24",
    "we can find the relative importance of the jeans scale and @xmath15 , @xmath25^{1/2}\\\\\\nonumber & \\approx & 6.62(1+\\delta)^{-1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is essentially redshift - independent for the redshifts relevant to the ly@xmath0  forest .",
    "the jeans length of equation  ( [ eqn : jeans ] ) divides stable from unstable modes in a static , homogeneous , self - gravitating medium .",
    "the igm is expanding , inhomogeneous , non  self - gravitating ( because dark matter dominates ) , and evolving in density and temperature on the same timescale that fluctuations grow .",
    "even for linear perturbations in a baryonic universe , the `` filtering scale '' below which fluctuations growth is suppressed depends on the thermal history of the gas rather than the instantaneous temperature - density relation @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect equation  ( [ eqn : jeans ] ) to describe the scale of gas pressure support only at an order - of - magnitude level .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : vjsigth ] ) shows that jeans velocities and thermal velocities should be comparable at the overdensities of typical ly@xmath0  forest features , but the calculation is not definitive enough to show whether one will dominate in practice .",
    "hence , to predict the statistical properties of the ly@xmath0forest in a given cosmological model , one must calculate the predicted gas distribution .",
    "the most reliable way to do this uses full @xmath26-body plus hydrodynamic simulations , which include the gravity of dark matter and gas and the additional effects of pressure , adiabatic heating and cooling , heating by photoionization and shocks , and radiative cooling .",
    "however , large volume hydrodynamic simulations with the necessary resolution are computationally intensive . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that one can achieve reasonable accuracy in the ly@xmath0  forest regime from pure dark matter simulations , applying the temperature - density relation to the evolved dark matter distribution to compute spectra .",
    "indeed , the log - normal model @xcite , in which the dark matter distribution is computed from the linear density field by an exponential transformation @xcite , provides a qualitatively accurate physical model of the ly@xmath0  forest , sufficient for creating artificial spectra with reasonable statistical properties .",
    "a fast way to include the effects of gas pressure in an approximate way is the hydrodynamic particle - mesh ( hpm ) method @xcite .",
    "hpm assumes that all the gas follows the power - law igm equation of state , and it uses a modification of the standard ( fast ) particle - mesh @xmath26-body method to compute the sum of gravitational forces and pressure gradient forces given this equation of state . in a detailed comparison of fully hydrodynamic sph simulations and the approximated hpm simulations , both evolved using gadget-2 , @xcite found that while the hpm approach does converge to the sph results , for some ly@xmath0  forest properties , such as the flux probability distribution or small - scale power spectrum , it can differ from the sph calculation by as much as 50% at @xmath27 . a simpler alternative",
    "to hpm is to use a pure @xmath26-body simulation but smooth the evolved dark matter distribution on the jeans scale before extracting ly@xmath0  forest spectra @xcite .",
    "because the jeans smoothing is three - dimensional , it is not degenerate with line - of - sight thermal broadening .",
    "@xcite found that , even though the thermal broadening dominates the pressure correction , the value of the jeans length becomes a large source of uncertainty in cosmological inferences from the ly@xmath0  forest if one tries to estimate it from the data rather than predict it from theory . because the jeans length is expected to vary with the gas temperature and density , a zeldovich - like scheme can be used when smoothing the dark matter distribution in order to model these effects @xcite .",
    "though we do not carry out a comprehensive comparison of these methods here , we do investigate the impact of pressure in detail , as well as compare full sph simulations to results derived from the dark matter distribution alone .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper and its companion ( peeples et al.2009 , hereafter paper  ii ) is to disentangle the roles of pressure support and thermal broadening in the ly@xmath0  forest by studying two sph simulations with different thermal histories and temperature - density relations .",
    "in addition to examining the physics of the ly@xmath0  forest , this study is motivated by observational evidence ( discussed in  [ sec : rhot ] ) that the temperature of the igm at @xmath274 is higher than expected from simple photoionization models by a factor of 1.52 .",
    "this evidence comes from analyses of data along single lines of sight .",
    "because the higher pressure associated with hotter gas would smooth the igm in three dimensions , using closely paired lines of sight to probe this coherence scale has been proposed as an alternative route for inferring the temperature - density relation ( j.  hennawi , private communication , 2007 ) . however , before we can understand the relative roles of temperature and pressure on the transverse structure of the lyman-@xmath0  forest , we must first understand their longitudinal effects along independent sightlines , which is the goal of this paper .",
    "while here we find that thermal broadening dominates pressure support in setting the level of longitudinal structure in the ly@xmath0  forest , in paper ii we show that the gas jeans length dominates the level of coherence transverse to the line of sight .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : sims ] , we describe the sph simulations we have evolved to investigate these effects . in  [ sec : physics ] , we describe the physics of the ly@xmath0  forest in these simulations and examine the impact of the thermal history on observable spectra ; this section also serves to review the physical understanding of the high - redshift ly@xmath0  forest that has emerged from simulations and associated analytic work since the mid-1990s .",
    "we then study these effects on several typical statistical measures for learning about the igm from the ly@xmath0  forest in  [ sec : stats ] , with our conclusions in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we analyze two sph simulations with identical initial conditions , one with a fiducial photoionization heating rate and one with a heating rate from photoionization that is four times higher than the fiducial ; hereafter , we refer to these simulations as the `` fiducial '' and `` h4 '' simulations , respectively . in the terminology of @xcite , we compute the photoionization rates @xmath28 and photoionization heating rates @xmath29 for the fiducial simulation assuming the @xcite quasar@xmath30galaxy photoionizing background , and for the h4 simulation we increase @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 by a factor of four . in principle",
    ", these heating rates could arise from a much harder uv background spectrum that yields more residual energy per photo - electron .",
    "however , we do not propose any specific model for these heating rates  they are a computationally simple way to obtain igm temperatures that are higher than those in the fiducial model and closer to those estimated from observations ( see  [ sec : rhot ] for further discussion ) .",
    "we evolve these sph simulations using the parallel gadget-2 code @xcite to trace the evolution of @xmath34 dark matter and @xmath34 gas particles in a @xmath35mpc comoving cubic volume from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "we also evolved another simulation using the fiducial heating rates and the same initial conditions but only @xmath38 particles to serve as a test for resolution convergence .",
    "we adopt a standard @xmath39cdm cosmological model with the parameters @xmath40 , all of which are in good agreement with the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ) five - year results @xcite ; our choice of @xmath41 , however , is somewhat lower than what is typically considered for ly@xmath0  studies .",
    "these parameters give a mass per sph particle of @xmath42 , which is much less than the typical jeans mass of @xmath43 .",
    "the spline gravitational force softening has an equivalent plummer length of @xmath44kpc comoving ( @xmath45 of the initial particle grid spacing ) .",
    "the sph smoothing lengths are chosen to enclose @xmath46 neighbors within the smoothing kernel .",
    "the simulation incorporates standard heating and atomic cooling processes and the standard gadget-2 treatment of star formation and metal enrichment .",
    "these simulations do not incorporate galactic winds , but these should have very little effect on the ly@xmath0  forest @xcite .",
    "we extract spectra from the sph gas distribution using tipsy , as described by @xcite .",
    "following common practice , we rescale the intensity of the uv background so that the mean flux decrement of the extracted spectra matches observations ( table  [ tab : rhot ] ) , as the mean decrement itself is much better known than the background intensity ( see discussions by , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our extracted spectra have 1250 pixels across the @xmath47mpc volume , making the pixel size @xmath48kms@xmath49 , which is well below the smoothing scale imposed by thermal broadening .",
    "in the absence of shock heating , the evolution of the temperature of the igm is described by @xmath50\\frac{\\mbox{d}\\delta}{\\mbox{d}z }        - \\left[\\frac{t}{m}\\right]\\frac{\\mbox{d}m}{\\mbox{d}z } + \\frac{2}{3k_{\\mbox{\\tiny $ b$}}n_b}\\frac{\\mbox{d}q}{\\mbox{d}z},\\ ] ] as shown in detail by @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 depend on the cosmology , the overdensity @xmath53 , @xmath16 is the mean particle mass , and @xmath54 is the net power per unit volume owing to the ambient radiation field .",
    "the first two terms in equation  ( [ eqn : dtdz ] ) describe heating and cooling owing to adiabatic processes .",
    "after reionization , the change in temperature owing to the change in the ionization fraction ( the third term in equation  [ [ eqn : dtdz ] ] ) is effectively zero at all redshifts and relevant densities .",
    "hydrogen reionization produces one energetic photoelectron per hydrogen atom , and it is expected to heat the igm to a temperature @xmath55@xmath56k , depending on the spectral shape of the ionizing sources and radiative transfer effects @xcite .",
    "thereafter , adiabatic cooling reduces the overall temperature , but denser regions remain hotter because they have higher neutral fractions and thus higher photoionization heating rates . at a given redshift ,",
    "the simulated temperature - density ( @xmath57-@xmath19 ) relation of the photoionized medium can be well approximated by a powerlaw , @xmath58 the slope @xmath59 approaches @xmath60 well after reionization .",
    "evolution with the @xcite uv background spectrum and @xmath61 yields @xmath62k at @xmath374 , for reionization at @xmath63 ( e.g. , @xcite ; table  [ tab : rhot ] ) .",

    "most of the gas falls along a tight locus , as expected from the above discussion . at higher densities ( @xmath66 ) ,",
    "the gas has begun to cool to form galaxies . the higher temperature gas has been shock heated .",
    "( the apparent increase in temperature at @xmath67 owes to the way gadget-2 treats the multiphase interstellar medium . ) for many of our subsequent analyses , we will isolate physical effects by imposing one of the three @xmath57-@xmath19  relations , denoted by dashed lines in figure  [ fig : rhot ] .",
    "specifically , we assign each gas ( or dark matter ) particle the temperature implied by its overdensity and a given @xmath57-@xmath19  relation before extracting spectra .",
    "the yellow line is an eyeball fit to the @xmath57-@xmath19  relation in the fiducial simulation , while the pink line is the corresponding fit to the h4 relation ; the h4 @xmath57-@xmath19normalization is @xmath68 times higher than the fiducial normalization . in both of these cases we set gas with @xmath69 to a `` shocked '' temperature of @xmath70k , so that this high density gas will be entirely ionized and thus not contribute to the ly@xmath0  forest .",
    "the mass- and volume - fraction of gas in these high density regions is relatively tiny ; for all of the statistics presented here , the fiducial and h4 gas distributions using the imposed fiducial and h4 @xmath57-@xmath19  relations , respectively , yield nearly identical results to those obtained using the actual temperatures calculated by gadget-2 .",
    "parameters for these fits are listed in table  [ tab : rhot ] .",
    "for some comparisons , we impose a flat @xmath57-@xmath19relation , with all particles set to @xmath71k , as shown by the blue dashed line .",

    "a harder photoionizing spectrum produces more energy input per photoelectron and thus a higher igm temperature .",
    "it is this solution that we adopt for our h4 simulation , though the heating rates we adopt correspond to an implausibly hard spectrum .",
    "the structure of the ly@xmath0  forest should depend on the @xmath57-@xmath19  relation but be fairly insensitive to the detailed mechanism that produces it , so we expect our conclusions about the impact of pressure support to apply to a broad range of such mechanisms",
    ". however , the tension between the @xmath57-@xmath19  relations predicted from theory and those inferred from observations remain puzzling , and it is not clear whether the resolution lies in modest changes ( e.g. , temperatures at the low end of observational estimates and a spectrum that is harder than conventionally assumed ) or a physical process that has not yet been identified .",
    "precisely because of this tension , it is important to understand the physics and observational consequences of pressure support in the ly@xmath0  forest , as we study in this paper and in paper  ii .    in figure",

    "furthermore , as cross - correlation functions are more typically used to describe information in closely paired lines of sight than cross - power spectra , it is important for us to understand the effects of pressure and temperature on the autocorrelation function before examining paired sightlines ( in paper  ii ) .        figure  [ fig : autocorr ] plots normalized flux decrement autocorrelation functions at @xmath133 , 3.0 , and 4.0 .",

    "the fiducial simulation has more high overdensity gas ( figure  [ fig : rhohist ] ) , but because this gas is at high temperature ( with @xmath172^{0.6}$ ] ) , thermal broadening converts narrow , fully saturated features to broader , moderately saturated ones .",

    "in contrast to the power spectrum and flux correlation function , thermal broadening and pressure support have comparable impact on the flux pdf , and they interact in complex ways .",
    "this different behavior arises because the pdf responds directly to the full overdensity distribution and its mapping to flux , while the power spectrum and correlation function measure the variance of this distribution as a function of scale .",
    "we have investigated the relative importance of pressure support and thermal broadening in determining the longitudinal structure of the lyman-@xmath0  forest .",
    "our main results come from comparing two sph simulations with identical initial conditions but different photoionization heating rates , which produce a factor of @xmath68 difference in the temperature of diffuse igm gas .",
    "we have imposed different temperature - density relations on the simulation outputs to isolate physical effects , extracted spectra from the dark matter distribution to extend our investigation to the pressureless case , and compared the fiducial simulation ( @xmath4 particles ) to a lower resolution simulation ( @xmath3 ) to quantify numerical resolution effects .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : vjsigth ] ) shows that the hubble flow across the jeans scale is generally of the same magnitude as thermal broadening ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "however , the igm is an expanding , inhomogeneous medium evolving in the potential of a non - linear dark matter distribution , so the jeans length is at best an approximate description of the scale imposed by gas pressure support .",
    "it is therefore difficult to know without detailed simulations whether thermal broadening or pressure support will dominate the structure of the forest .",
    "a related question is the meaning of the density contrast @xmath180 in the fluctuating gunn - peterson approximation ( equation  [ eqn : tau ] ) . in principle",
    ", this should be the density of the gas that is absorbing ly@xmath0  photons , but analyses of early sph simulations found that ly@xmath0  forest spectra created from the ( pressureless ) dark matter distribution were remarkably similar to those created from the ( pressure supported ) gas distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the relatively low resolution of those simulations ( a mass resolution that is @xmath181 times lower than our fiducial simulation here ) raised the possibility that both sets of spectra were artificially broadened to the numerical resolution limit .",
    "we investigate this issue more confidently here because the initial particle spacing of our @xmath34 simulations , @xmath182kpc comoving , is far below the typical jeans length at igm overdensities , @xmath183kpc comoving , and because our @xmath142 simulation allows a direct resolution test .    in broad brush ,",
    "our conclusions are that thermal broadening dominates over pressure support in determining the visual appearance and statistical properties of the ly@xmath0  forest , but that differences in gas pressure do have a noticeable effect .",
    "the widths of absorption features are typically set by hubble flow across the absorbing structure , though thermal broadening does smooth out small scale corrugations to create coherent features ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : zoo ] ) .",
    "once we include thermal broadening , the spectra created from dark matter distributions are similar to those created from the gas , even though the effects of pressure support on the gas density field are readily discernible .",
    "thus , one can drastically change the jeans scale without drastically changing the forest . however , dark matter spectra are visually and statistically distinguishable from gas spectra , more so than in the earlier generation of lower resolution sph simulations .",

    "h4 @xmath57-@xmath19  relation on all three .",
    "similar conclusions hold for the coherence scale of the flux decrement autocorrelation function .",
    "however , in both cases , the weak impact of pressure support partly owes to a cancellation effect that arises with a sloped @xmath57-@xmath19  relation : a higher pressure distribution has more `` jeans broadening , '' but it has less thermal broadening because there is less high overdensity , high temperature gas .",
    "when we impose a constant igm temperature of @xmath151k , the differences among the three cases are more noticeable , though they are still small compared to the effects of thermal broadening . for the flux decrement probability distribution function ,",

    "is adequate .",
    "though it is a stronger player than pressure support in setting the scale of the longitudinal ly@xmath0  forest , thermal broadening is an inherently one - dimensional phenomenon . because pressure acts in three dimensions , we expect it to play the main role in setting the _ transverse _ coherence of the ly@xmath0  forest across neighboring sightlines .",

    "<S> however , the insensitivity to pressure arises partly from a cancellation effect with a sloped temperature - density relation ( @xmath2 in our simulations ) : the high density peaks in the colder , lower pressure simulation are less smoothed by pressure support than in the hotter simulation , and it is this higher density gas that experiences the strongest thermal broadening . </S>",
    "<S> changes in thermal broadening and pressure support have comparably important effects on the flux probability distribution ( pdf ) , which responds directly to the gas overdensity distribution rather than the scale on which it is smooth . </S>",
    "<S> tests on a lower resolution simulation ( @xmath3 vs.@xmath4 particles in a @xmath5 comoving box ) show that our statistical results are converged even at this lower resolution . </S>",
    "<S> while thermal broadening generally dominates the longitudinal structure in the ly@xmath0  forest , we show in paper  ii that pressure support determines the transverse coherence of the forest observed towards close quasar pairs .    </S>",
