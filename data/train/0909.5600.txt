    "dark sunward sinuous lanes moving along a fan of rays above post  flare loops towards a supra  arcade with a decelerating speed in the range of @xmath1 km s@xmath2 were firstly described by mckenzie and hudson @xcite , using the yohkoh soft x  ray telescope .",
    "further observations showed that the fraction of solar flare long  duration event arcades possessing fans is not small , and that downflows above such arcades are not uncommon ( mckenzie @xcite ) .",
    "the phenomena were extensively studied by several authors ( wang et al .",
    "@xcite ; innes et al .",
    "@xcitea , b ; svestka et al",
    ". @xcite ; asai et al .",
    "@xcite ; mckenzie and savage @xcite ) and different theoretical explanations have been offered to give account of the physics of the underlying process .",
    "mckenzie @xcite dismissed the interpretation that x  ray voids could be explained as evidence of blobs of cool material separated from the main body of a cme falling gravitationally back to the surface of the sun .",
    "this author supported the explanation that flux tubes linking an above current sheet retract into the arcade under the force of magnetic tension ( see also wang et al .",
    "the down moving structures observed at @xmath3 mm heights above the top of the arcade indicated that the reconnection site must be located above the flare arcade",
    ". sheeley and wang @xcite interpreted the phenomenon as the top of collapsing loops with void tails in the wakes where reconnection occurs .",
    "asai et al .",
    "@xcite proposed , based on rhessi observations , that dark lanes are sunward voided flows generated by the reconnection process developed by a current sheet at the supra  arcade .",

    "arcade of noaa active region 9906 on the @xmath4st of april @xmath5 they interpreted two oscillating in phase edges ( c and d in vnc ) as fast surface magnetoacoustic kink wave trains guided by the ray structure .",
    "they founded that the phase speeds and the displacement amplitudes decrease as they propagate downwards and derived a function to fit the amplitude of the oscillating perturbation at a given height .",
    "the period remained constant with height .",
    "as a function of time , the phase speeds decreased and periods increased .    in this letter , based on the following arguments ,",
    "we propose a new scenario to numerically give account of the phenomenology described in vnc : 1 ) the observational phase speed magnitude in vnc is several hundreds of km s@xmath2 lower than the alfvn estimations , this could suggest that slow speed sunward processes , rather than fast ones , are at work ; also , 2 ) an impulsive energy deposition or pressure pulse can lead to lower speed void features obtained as a result of nonlinear interacting slow shocks , i.e. , where the magnetic field plays the role of being the wave guide of a fundamentally hydrodynamic shock ( fernndez et al .",
    "this fact is a starting supposition to simulate the dynamics along the magnetic field lines .",
    "3 ) the sunward dynamics is differentiated , from the transverse one because conductive energy transport along field lines is far more effective than across them , thus , we assume independence between the dynamics of two main directions : the sunward and the transverse to the magnetic field one .",
    "4 ) as the impulsive triggering mechanism acts in all directions , a perpendicular magnetic shock can develop in the transverse direction . in conclusion ,",
    "our modeling is accomplished supposing that a pressure pulse applied to the coronal inhomogeneous medium , structured by a main magnetic field , is a triggering mechanism of two fundamental independent shock schemes , an hydrodynamic one and a magnetic perpendicular one . on each direction",
    "the interaction of the nonlinear waves will give rise to the different patterns we are interested in .",
    "we emphasize that if the simulations reproduce the observational data , e.g. , the kink  like features , the temporal cadences , the phase speed and sunward pattern functional decreases , in the frame of a few reasonable suppositions , this implies that the overall scheme could be at the bases of the underlying physical processes .",
    "even when a full numerical simulation is required , this two 1d @xmath0 modeling , is a useful first approach , certainly , if due to its simplification and to the accuracy in the observational description suggests that it had captured important physical processes .",
    "to simulate time dependent mhd flows we use a method developed by us ( elaskar et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the equations used are the continuity , momentum , energy and magnetic induction equations together with the state equation forming a system of partial hyperbolic differential equations .",
    "the numerical approach consists of an approximate riemann solver with the tvd scheme proposed by yee for gasdynamics flows ( yee et al .",
    "the `` eigensystem '' technique presented by powell @xcite was also used with the eigenvector normalization proposed by zarachay et al . @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the technique was verified by means of simulations of the riemann problem introduced by brio and wu and the hartmann flows ( maglione et al .",
    "in vnc , to study supra  arcade ray structures the authors chose a rectangular subfield of parallel @xmath6 and perpendicular @xmath7 to the supra - arcade ray coordinates where the structures were visible .",
    "they could describe the oscillatory motions of four dark transverse displacements for a fixed vertical coordinate as a function of time , i.e. @xmath8 mm .",
    "also , they displayed the intensity variations of the ray parallel coordinate as a function of time i.e. , @xmath9 averaged over a segment of the @xmath10 coordinate , @xmath11 mm , ( fig .  1 - 2 in vnc ) .",
    "they found that the period @xmath12 remains constant with height but the amplitude and phase speed decrease as the wave travels sunwards . assuming a transverse perturbation of the form @xmath13 , $ ] @xmath14 is the time , and @xmath15 the height",

    "edge c s tail has a kink  like structure and edge d , more irregular , resembles a sausage  like structure in part of its tail .",
    "table 1 shows the observational wave parameters in vnc used to adjust the numerical simulation .    to perform the numerical simulation the physical quantities",
    "are expressed in a dimensionless form . as in vnc",
    "the coordinate @xmath15 represents the sunward direction and the @xmath10 coordinate the transverse to the magnetic field one , as seen by the line of sight .",
    "figure  [ fig : cero ] shows a scheme of the numerical domain of the two 1d@xmath0 independent integrations performed , i.e. two main initial shock wave fronts triggered by the same pressure perturbation .",
    "one directed sunwards , parallel to the field lines , and the other directed transversally to them .",
    "the composition of the two processes will give the overall description .",
    "the details of the energy deposition mechanism are not taken into account here e.g. , reconnection processes as the one suggested by asai et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "traditionally it is expected that the observations are due to the direct action of boundary effects between the void and the surrounding medium .",
    "our simulations show that the observational void patterns can also be obtained as a result of nonlinear evolution of waves triggered by an instantaneous pressure pulse .",
    "it is required , however , that the media has density inhomogeneities aligned with the magnetic field , in order to produce the interferences upon reflection that are responsible of sustaining the void lanes .",
    "the initial perturbation , seen as a transverse to the field line phenomenon , produces opposite magnetic shock waves that bounce in the lateral and denser boundary medium composing an oscillatory pattern of nonlinear wave interactions whose evolution leads to an internal defined central vacuum region .",
    "the effect of the density inhomogeneities -which produce partial reflections and absorptions of waves , e.g , it was estimated that density values can rise at least between two and five times from the void to the denser medium ( mckenzie and hudson @xcite ; innes et al .",
    "@xcite)- are taken into account as density steps modeled by reflecting boundaries at the extremes of the integration domain .",
    "we performed several simulation with different values of the non  dimensional boundary density , allowing partial or total rebounds of the waves , and we found that the result is robust in the sense that the oscillating pattern is conserved for a density range going from four to ten times the non  perturbed initial value .",
    "a study of sensitive to the initial and boundary conditions will be matter of a new work together with a 1d and 2d simulation . a resulting simulation that accurately fits the edge c description in vnc is shown in fig .",

    "the darker region corresponds to the resulting vacuum zone pattern , with vanishing values of the density , i.e. the non  dimensional vacuum density is @xmath20 while the external medium value results @xmath21 .",
    "note that the simulation assumes an initial pressure pulse that triggers the whole pattern , thus the following process of wave interactions produces and sustains the void cavity for a time interval which is in accordance with the observations , as it can be seen from the figure .",
    "if the @xmath22 partition is modified , a sausage  like description can be obtained as it is shown in fig .",

    "this figure was adjusted with the sausage  like edge d data .",
    "the differences between fig .",
    "[ fig : uno]a and fig .",
    "[ fig : uno]b are due to the fact that in the first case an asymmetric rebound occurs while in the second one the rebound is symmetric .",
    "like structures seem more probable than the sausage  like ones because the symmetric condition requirement of the external inhomogeneous media is more improbable .",
    "figure  [ fig : uno ] shows that the vacuum is immediately originated by the pulse and the interaction of the non  linear waves composes and sustains a kink  like or a sausage  like pattern for a large period of time .",
    "the procedure of convertion into the dimensionless quantities and the relations that couple the transverse and radial parameters are described in next subsection .",
