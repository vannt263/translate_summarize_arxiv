    "measurements of polarised deep inelastic lepton  nucleon scattering have determined the cross section asymmetries @xmath8 and spin dependent structure functions @xmath3 of the proton , deuteron and neutron in a wide kinematic range of @xmath2 and @xmath1 . where @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 denoting the four momentum transfer between leptons and the four momentum of the nucleon respectively .",

    "jaffe sum rules .",
    "evaluation of the sum rules requires knowledge of the structure functions @xmath3 over the entire region of @xmath1 as well as their evolution to a common value of @xmath2 .",
    "since the experimentally accessible @xmath1 range is limited , extrapolations to @xmath12 0 and @xmath12 1 are necessary . of these",
    "the former is critical since the small @xmath1 behaviour of @xmath13 is theoretically not well established and the relevant contribution to the sum rules integral may in principle be large .",
    "+ theoretical predictions for the structure function @xmath3 over a full range of @xmath1 are even more interesting than for its first moment , especially at low @xmath1 , i.e. at high parton densities , where the new dynamical mechanisms may be revealed",
    ". theoretical and experimental studies at low @xmath1 in the polarised case are thus awaited for . a possible future polarising the proton beam at hera",
    "would be a milestone in this field .",
    "+ in the fixed target experiments the low values of @xmath1 are reached by lowering at the same time the values of @xmath2 .",
    "theoretical analysis of these data therefore requires a suitable extrapolation of the structure function to the low @xmath2 region .",
    "low @xmath2 phenomena and in particular a transition from the perturbative ( large @xmath2 ) to the nonperturbative ( low @xmath2 , including @xmath2=0 ) region is actively investigated in the spin insensitive experiments . in spite of a wealth of data and of a wide spectrum of ideas",
    "this field is still a major challenge in high energy physics @xcite . among the spin sensitive experiments the only available low @xmath2 data are from the e143 experiment at slac @xcite ( moderate @xmath1 and low @xmath2 ) and now also from the smc at cern @xcite ( low @xmath1 and low @xmath2 ) . in the low @xmath2 region",
    "one can expect that dynamical mechanisms , like the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) , can play an important role . for large @xmath2 the vmd contribution to @xmath3",
    "gives a power correction term and can usually be neglected . moreover ,",
    "the partonic contribution to @xmath3 which controls the structure functions in the deep inelastic domain has to be suitably extended in order to get its extrapolation to the low @xmath2 region . the latter component will be expressed in terms of the unintegrated ( spin dependent ) parton distributions and we show that the corresponding representation of @xmath3 can be easily extrapolated to the low @xmath2 region .",
    "the main purpose of our paper is therefore to construct the structure function @xmath0 which would include the vmd and the ( qcd improved ) parton model contributions .",
    "+ the content of the paper is as follows : in the next section we present the data on @xmath3 and comment on the regge model predictions for @xmath3 which are often being used for @xmath12 0 extrapolations . in sec.3",

    "one expects that in the low @xmath2 region an important role may be played by the vmd mechanism .",
    "the structure function should thus be represented by the sum of the partonic and vmd contributions , i.e. @xmath95    the vmd contribution to @xmath0 can be written as : @xmath96 in this formula the constants @xmath97 are determined from the leptonic widths of the vector mesons @xcite and @xmath98 denotes the mass of the vector meson @xmath99 .",
