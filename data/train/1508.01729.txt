    "<S> the operational bandwidth of our scheme is determined by the medium ; the delay depends on the control field intensity , frequency spacing between raman levels , and raman linewidths . </S>",
    "<S> given that we use linear dispersion between two absorption lines , temporal delay is accompanied by loss . delay per loss remains independent of the peak optical depth and only depends on the frequency spacing between the raman absorption lines , and the raman linewidths . </S>",
    "<S> for the theoretical parameters modelled , a delay - bandwidth product of 1 corresponds to @xmath771.5  db loss . </S>",
    "<S> the loss can be reduced by using a medium with narrower raman linewidths .    in principle , due to the use of absorption features , rather than gain features which add noise photons to the delayed signal pulse , our scheme can be implemented to process single - photons . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , noise photons created by raman scattering of control photons from thermal excitations could be spectrally - filtered to preserve the single photon charactersitics of the signal . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the off - resonant raman coupling , the delay can be controlled optically , delivering frequency tunability , and the possibility of operating on multiple signals concurrently by frequency - multiplexing . furthermore , alternative media with more raman lines can be considered to provide multimode functionality with one control field . </S>",
    "<S> for example , ro - vibrational manifolds of liquid or gas phase molecular ensembles in hollow - core fibres are attractive candidate systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that this scheme will find use in ultrafast quantum processing applications , perhaps in combination with a frequency - shifter  @xcite for pulse sequencing , for example  @xcite .    </S>",
