    "recently , there has been a renewed interest in zero range interactions  @xcite .",
    "zero range interactions provide a simple , but important limiting case for short range forces . as such",
    ", they are useful for many applications in nuclear and atomic physics .",
    "furthermore , the zero range interaction for nucleons has been revisited in the context of effective chiral theories , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it is an appealing approximation for few - body problems , as it simplifies the corresponding equations  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that the non - relativistic three - body system based on zero range forces experiences the thomas collapse  @xcite . to prevent the thomas collapse several regularization schemes",
    "have been suggested  @xcite .",
    "the thomas collapse occurs when the binding energy of the system is unbounded from below .",
    "however , as the binding energy becomes larger , it eventually compares with and exceeds the size of the constituent masses and hence , a nonrelativistic treatment of the problem is not sufficient .",
    "the relativistic three - particle problem with zero range interactions has been tackled using minimal relativistic three - particle equations  @xcite and relativistic light front equations  @xcite .",
    "the latter has been revisited by carbonell and karmanov in a covariant light front approach . given a constituent mass @xmath0 of the particles they succeed to solve the three - body equation without introducing a regularization scheme  @xcite .",
    "previously , a regularization procedure has been introduced  @xcite that is equivalent to a smearing of the zero range interaction . moreover ,",
    "the particular cut - off chosen in these approaches prevents the relativistic analog of the thomas collapse from occuring , namely the zero mass limit for the three - body bound state . in this paper , we study the dependence on an invariant cut - off @xmath1 .",
    "the numerical limit @xmath2 coincides with the results of carbonell and karmanov , where a comparison can be made .",
    "the relativistic analog of the thomas collapse appears for all @xmath1 .",
    "we find that for weakly bound states the dependence on the cut - off is mild .",
    "we briefly review the basic ingredients of the three - body equations on the light front given earlier  @xcite .",
    "for a zero range interaction in the particle - particle channel the equation represented by fig .",
    "[ fig : t2 ] can be summed and leads to a solution for the two - particle propagator @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath4 the expression for @xmath5 corresponds to a loop diagram . in the rest system of the two - body system",
    "@xmath6 it is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 the light front coordinates of particle 1 are @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the integral involving @xmath5 has a logarithmic divergence that can be absorbed in a redefinition of @xmath13 .",
    "to do so one has to assume that the two particle amplitude @xmath3 has a pole for @xmath14 .",
    "we may then write @xmath15 hence , the physical information introduced in the renormalization of the amplitude is the mass of the two bound particles , @xmath16 .",
    "the subtraction imposed by condition ( [ eqn : bound ] ) in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tau ] ) makes @xmath3 finite . the resulting expression for the two - body propagator",
    "is then given by @xmath17\\big)/(2\\pi)^2 , \\label{eqn : tau2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 the above eq .",
    "( [ eqn : bound ] ) has been utilized in  @xcite and subsequent calculations  @xcite .",
    "however , it is restricted to cases with a two - body bound state . in order to investigate a solution of the three - body bound state equation also for cases where",
    "no two - body bound state exists , we now introduce an invariant cut - off in the integral ( [ eqn : b ] ) , i.e. @xmath19 which makes the integral finite . with this cut - off",
    "the integral reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 consequently @xmath22 depends on @xmath1 as well .",
    "we now turn to the three - particle case .",
    "the expression for the two - body mass embedded in the three - body system is @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the momentum of the third particle .",
    "the three - body system is taken at rest , @xmath25 . in the three - body rest frame",
    "we define @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "again we formally introduce an invariant regularization , @xmath28 hence the relativistic equation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : b3 ] ) on the light front is given by @xmath29 where we have introduced the vertex function @xmath30 .",
    "the mass of the virtual three - particle state ( in the rest system ) is @xmath31 which is the sum of the on - shell minus - components of the three particles",
    ".    equation ( [ eqn : fad ] ) coincides with the one given previously @xcite except for the regularization scheme , which we call scheme a in the following . in @xcite the integration limits have been introduced to satisfy @xmath32 and hence @xmath33 with @xmath34 . as noted correctly by  @xcite in this case one no longer deals with zero range forces . in combination with ( [ eqn : bound ] ) the",
    "invariant cut - off chosen here allows us to perform the zero range limit for @xmath35 .",
    "however , beyond that , the cut - off allows us to treat three - body states without two - body bound states as well , i.e. where ( [ eqn : bound ] ) does not hold .",
    "we present our results in two subsections .",
    "first we focus on the more general aspects of the calculation without fixing any of the parameters . later on we choose the parameters to reproduce the physical proton mass ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) to discuss more quantitative aspects of the approach .      for the more general discussion we present our results as a function of the interaction strength @xmath36 . to solve ( [ eqn : fad ] ) we use the cut - off parameters @xmath37 where @xmath0 is the constituent mass , and @xmath38",
    ". in fig .",
    "[ fig : m23l ] we show @xmath16 and @xmath39 ( in units of m ) of the solution of the two - body bound state and the three - body bound state as a function of the strength @xmath36 .",
    "several features can be recognized :    _ i ) _ the values of the strength parameter @xmath40 where bound states exist , become smaller as the cut - off @xmath41 becomes larger .",
    "this can been seen clearly , if one assumes a two - body bound state @xmath16 to exist , see ( [ eqn : bound ] ) : as @xmath42 and therefore @xmath43 the strength @xmath44 , provided the mass of the bound state is independent of the cut - off . in turn , this implies that the interaction strength depends on the cut - off , @xmath45 .",
    "_ ii ) _ for a certain @xmath46 the three - body bound state shows @xmath47 despite a finite value of @xmath16 .",
    "this is the relativistic analog of the thomas collapse  @xcite .",
    "_ iii ) _ as @xmath48 , i.e. reaches the continuum state , the three - body bound state still exists .",
    "the parameter for which this situation occurs depends on the range of the interaction .",
    "it may give rise to the efimov effect , an issue not further addressed here .    _",
    "iv ) _ there is a region of parameters where both @xmath16 and @xmath39 exist . for this particular case",
    "it is possible to plot @xmath39 vs. @xmath16 .",
    "this has been done in previous calculations .",
    "in fact , for case _ iv ) _ we show the respective plot @xmath49 in fig .",
    "[ fig : m23 ] . as explained before , using ( [ eqn : bound ] ) as a physics input ,",
    "it is possible to eliminate the @xmath46 and @xmath1 dependence from the solution of the three - body equation .    a similar plot that is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : b3l ] shows the cut - off dependence of @xmath50 for a given fixed two - body mass @xmath16 .",
    "again the mass @xmath47 indicates the thomas collapse .",
    "the region close to threshold is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : b23 ] and parameterized in terms of the binding energies @xmath51    it is worthwhile to note that for large invariant cut - off masses the resulting function @xmath49 coincides with the result that utilizes ( [ eqn : bound ] ) and solves ( [ eqn : fad ] ) without cut - off restrictions . in this sense",
    "we reproduce the result of ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we go further , extending our regularization procedure and solving the three - body equation without assuming a two - body bound state . to this end",
    "the introduction of a cut - off is adequate . on the other hand ,",
    "a cut - off @xmath1 can be considered a physical input , e.g. as a scale limit for physics beyond the `` zero range approximation '' or as a range parameter of the interaction .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : m23 ] we have also given the earlier result using the regularization scheme a explained in the previous section .",
    "this shows no thomas collapse , because of the additional restriction @xmath52 for the intermediate state  @xcite .      in order to achieve more quantitative results",
    "we now introduce a scale into the calculation .",
    "although the model is not elaborate enough to expect a complete description of the baryon dynamics we choose the proton mass @xmath53 mev .",
    "this seems natural for a three - quark system and has been used before in this context  @xcite . for a more detailed description",
    "the spin has to be included on the light front , e.g. , along the lines of ref .",
    "the scale restricts the parameter space @xmath54 resulting in a two - dimensional surface of allowed parameters . to be more physical we present our results in two ways .",
    "first we choose a specific quark mass ( a ) and second we choose a specific cut - off @xmath1 ( b ) .",
    "a. as constituent masses we choose @xmath55mev  @xcite and @xmath56mev and a rather large one of @xmath57 mev . by fitting the proton mass",
    "this determines functions @xmath58 that are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : l ] .",
    "the grey area indicates the parameter values for which a two - body bound state exists .",
    "there are three interesting effects .",
    "_ i ) _ for the weakly bound system there exists a `` critical '' range ( parameterized through @xmath1 ) of the potential where no two - body bound state exists ( lines outside the grey area ) .",
    "this is the case for @xmath59 mev for all values of @xmath1 and for @xmath60 mev for values of @xmath1 above @xmath61 .",
    "hence there is a possibility that the nucleon could be a borromean system . for the nonrelativistic case of borromean systems ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite . _",
    "ii ) _ an intermediate quark mass already leads to the possibility of bound two - quark states .",
    "however , there is a moderate dependence on the cut - off , i.e. range of the interaction , and possibly other details of the dynamics . _",
    "iii ) _ a large quark mass ( @xmath57 mev ) leads to a large `` binding energy '' and hence requires the existence of bound two - quark states .",
    "b. alternatively one may choose a particular cut - off @xmath1 .",
    "this way , from @xmath62 we find a relation @xmath63 that of course still depends parametrically on @xmath1 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : qmass ] we show the resulting quark mass dependence necessary to reproduce the proton mass . to compare different cut - offs",
    "we have normalized the strength to the threshold strength @xmath64 , i.e. were ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the dotted horizontal line indicates the continuum limit @xmath66 .",
    "finally , one may wish to also fix the last parameter , @xmath1 . to this end",
    "one could use more empirical information .",
    "this has been done in @xcite for the regularization scheme a. we do not pursue this further .",
    "a detailed study of the nucleon dynamics is beyond our present aim and the capability of the model in its present form .",
    "we have investigated in detail the stability of a relativistic three boson system subject to an effective zero range interaction .",
    "we find the relativistic analog of the thomas collapse , which is given by @xmath47 .",
    "hence , the thomas collapse is present also for the relativistiv case , but depends on the regularization scheme .",
    "this could be seen by introducing an invariant cut - off @xmath1 that restricts the virtual masses in the respective few - body equations .",
    "the invariant cut - off can be understood as the limiting scale for physics beyond `` zero - range approximation '' or as an effective size parameter .",
    "therefore a finite value for @xmath1 is meaningful . in the limit @xmath67",
    "we reproduce results given earlier  @xcite . for a more quantitative discussion",
    "we have introduced the nucleon mass as a scale  @xcite .",
    "further analysis including a treatment of spins  @xcite is left for future investigations .",
