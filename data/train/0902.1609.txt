    "primarily , communication complexity , introduced by yao  @xcite , deals with the amount of communication that is needed in distributed computation , but apart from distributed computation , nowadays communication complexity has found applications in virtually all fields of complexity theory .",
    "the book by kushilevitz and nisan  @xcite gives a comprehensive introduction to communication complexity and its applications .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 players , each of them knowing exactly one argument of a function @xmath4 with @xmath0 arguments , want to evaluate the function for the input that is distributed among them . clearly , to succeed at this task the players need to communicate .",
    "here we consider the case that the players communicate by writing to a blackboard that is shared by all players .",
    "the rules that determine who writes which message to the blackboard are usually called a _",
    "protocol_. the protocol terminates if the value of the function can be inferred from the contents of the blackboard , the so - called _ transcript _ of the protocol .",
    "then the communication complexity of the function is the minimum number of bits that the players need to write to the blackboard in the worst case to jointly compute the result .",
    "this setting is usually called the _ number in the hand model _ since each part of the input is exclusively known to a single player who figuratively hides the input in his hand . in the randomized version of this model",
    "each player has access to a private source of unbiased independent random bits and his actions may depend on his input and his random bits . for a _",
    "randomized @xmath5-error protocol _ the output of the protocol may be different from the value of the function @xmath6 with probability at most @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath5-error randomized communication complexity of a function is defined in the obvious way .",
    "a formal definition of @xmath0-party protocols can be found in  @xcite .",
    "note that there are also other models of multi - party communication , but these models are not the topic of this paper .    in recent publications  @xcite",
    "lower bounds on the communication complexity of functions have been obtained by using information theoretical methods . in this context communication complexity",
    "is supplemented by an information theoretical counterpart , the information complexity of a function .",
    "roughly , the information complexity of a function @xmath6 is the minimal amount of information that the transcript of a protocol for @xmath6 must reveal about the input . besides being a lower bound for the communication complexity",
    ", information complexity has additional nice properties with respect to so - called direct sum problems .      in this paper",
    "we will prove an asymptotically optimal lower bound on the communication complexity of the multi - party set disjointness problem with the unique intersection promise .    in the @xmath0-party set disjointness problem each of the players",
    "is given the characteristic vector of a subset of an @xmath7-element set .",
    "it is promised that the subsets are either pairwise disjoint or that there is a single element that is contained in all subsets and that the subsets are disjoint otherwise .",
    "the players have to distinguish these two cases , the output of a protocol for set disjointness should be @xmath8 in the first case and @xmath9 in the second case .",
    "if the promise is broken , then the players may give an arbitrary answer .",
    "here we will prove the following result about the randomized communication complexity of the multi - party set disjointness problem in the number in the hand model .",
    "[ thm : main-1 ] for every sufficiently small constant @xmath10 the randomized @xmath5-error communication complexity of the @xmath0-party set disjointness problem with the unique intersection promise is bounded from below by @xmath2 .    by the",
    "upper bound shown in  @xcite this result is asymptotically optimal with respect to the number of players @xmath0 and the size of the inputs @xmath7",
    ". an important application of this problem is the proof of a lower bound for the memory requirements of certain data stream algorithms  @xcite .",
    "our improvement of the lower bound for disjointness does not have a significant impact on this application .",
    "but we think that the disjointness problem is interesting and important on its own since it is a well - known basic problem in communication complexity theory  @xcite . up to now",
    "the best known lower bound was @xmath11 by chakrabarti , khot , and sun  @xcite , who also proved an asymptotically optimal lower bound for one - way protocols .",
    "this result left a gap both between the upper and the lower bound and between the lower bounds for one - way protocols and unrestricted protocols .",
    "our result closes these gaps .    like the earlier results ,",
    "our lower bound is based on an information theoretical approach .",
    "the main ingredient of this approach is a lower bound on the information complexity of the @xmath1-function , the boolean conjunction of @xmath0 bits . since theorem  [ thm : main-1 ]",
    "will be a simple corollary of this result , and more importantly , since @xmath1 is a basic building block of any computation , the lower bound on the information complexity of @xmath1 is the main result of this paper .",
    "we postpone the precise statement of this result to theorem  [ thm : main-2 ] in section  [ sec : and ] because some preparing definitions are needed beforehand .",
    "but we stress here that our result also closes the gap between the upper and lower bound on the conditional information complexity of @xmath1 for unrestricted protocols and the gap between the lower bounds on the information complexity of @xmath1 for one - way protocols and unrestricted protocols that was left open in  @xcite .",
    "the general disjointness problem without the unique intersection promise has a long history in communication complexity theory .",
    "here we focus only on recent results for the multi - party set disjointness problem with the unique intersection promise , and especially on lower bounds that rely on information complexity arguments . for older results we refer the reader to the book by kushilevitz and nisan  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "alon , matias , and szegedy  @xcite proved an @xmath12 lower bound for multi - party set disjointness and applied this bound to prove lower bounds for the memory requirements of data stream algorithms .",
    "bar - yossef , jayram , kumar , and sivakumar  @xcite improved this to a lower bound of @xmath13 .",
    "they introduced the direct sum approach on which later results , including our result , are based and proved that the information complexity of @xmath1 is bounded from below by @xmath14 .",
    "chakrabarti , khot , and sun  @xcite improved the lower bound for the information complexity of @xmath1 to @xmath15 and thereby improved the lower bound for multi - party set disjointness to @xmath11 .",
    "they also proved an asymptotically optimal lower bound for one - way protocols , a restricted model in which the players communicate in a predetermined order .",
    "our result improves on these results , but furthermore we think that our proof technique is a useful contribution to the framework for which bar - yossef _ et al . _",
    "@xcite coined the term `` information statistics '' .",
    "bar - yossef _ et al .",
    "_ use this term for the combination of information theory and other statistical metrics on probability spaces .",
    "we use the direct sum approach from  @xcite , but instead of the hellinger distance that is used in  @xcite we use the kullback leibler distance . since the kullback leibler distance is closely related to mutual information , we do not loose precision in the transition from information theory to statistical distance measures . by this , we are able to prove sharper bounds . like chakrabarti _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , we take a closer look at the analytical properties of the functions that are involved .",
    "our improvements on this result are also due to the fact that our kullback leibler distance based arguments are very close to the information theory domain .",
    "we use lower case letters for constants and variables and upper case letters for random variables . if the random variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 have the same distribution , we briefly write @xmath18 . for vector - valued variables",
    "we use a boldface font .",
    "for example , @xmath19 is a random vector whose components are the random variables @xmath20 for @xmath21 . in this case",
    "let @xmath22 denote the vector @xmath23 without the @xmath24th component .",
    "a boldface zero @xmath25 and boldface one @xmath26 denote the all - zero vector and all - one vector of appropriate size , respectively .",
    "thus @xmath27 says that @xmath28 for all @xmath29 . for sums like @xmath30",
    "we sometimes do not explicitly specify the bounds of summation and just write @xmath31 . in this case the sum is taken over the set of all values of @xmath24 for which @xmath32 is meaningful .",

    "for example , the sum @xmath33 should be taken over all values @xmath34 in the range of @xmath16 .",
    "all logarithms , denoted by @xmath35 , are with respect to base @xmath36 .      here",
