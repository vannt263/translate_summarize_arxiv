    "the deflection of light by gravitational fields has been studied with great interest in astrophysics as well as in theoretical physics .",
    "fundamental properties such as fermat s principle for lorentzian manifolds , conditions on image multiplicity and caustics in spacetime have been discussed in a fully relativistic setting ( e.g. , see @xcite and references therein ) . in the astrophysical context , however , an impulse approximation with piecewise straight light rays in flat space has proven useful since deflection angles on cosmological scales are very small ( for a comprehensive introduction , see e.g. @xcite or @xcite pp 27295 and references therein ) . despite their different premisses ,",
    "both treatments have yielded mathematically interesting , general properties which depend on topology . in particular ,",
    "image counting theorems like the odd number theorem have been established with different versions of morse theory both in the spacetime lensing and impulse approximation frameworks @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we would like to present another approach to gravitational lensing theory which emphasizes global properties . specifically",
    ", we consider the astrophysically relevant weak deflection limit not in the impulse approximation but treat light rays as spatial geodesics of the optical metric , and use the gauss - bonnet theorem .",
    "this approach has previously been applied to lensing by cosmic strings @xcite , and we extend it here to static , spherically symmetric bodies of a perfect fluid as simple models for galaxies acting as gravitational lenses .",
    "it turns out that the focusing of light rays is , from this point of view , essentially a topological effect .",
    "hence we find , rather surprisingly , that the deflection angle can be calculated by integrating the gaussian curvature of the optical metric outwards from the light ray , in contrast to the usual description in terms of the mass enclosed within the impact parameter of the light ray .",
    "to illustrate , we discuss how this works for three well - known models , namely the schwarzschild lens , the plummer sphere and the singular isothermal sphere .",
    "the structure of this article is therefore as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a brief review of the gauss - bonnet theorem and introduce two constructions which will be used to investigate the lensing geometry .",
    "the optical metric and its gaussian curvature for static , spherically symmetric systems of a perfect fluid is discussed in section 3 , followed by the application to the three lens models mentioned above in section 4 .    with regard to conventions ,",
    "we use metric signature @xmath0 , latin and greek indices for space and spacetime coordinates , respectively , and set the speed of light @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath2 denotes the gravitational constant as usual .",
    "the gauss - bonnet theorem connects the intrinsic differential geometry of a surface with its topology , and this will be the main tool in our exposition .",
    "let the domain @xmath3 be a subset of a compact , oriented surface , with euler characteristic @xmath4 and a riemannian metric @xmath5 giving rise to a gaussian curvature @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath7 be its piecewise smooth boundary with geodesic curvature @xmath8 , where defined , and exterior angle @xmath9 at the @xmath10th vertex , traversed in the positive sense",
    ". then the local and global versions of the gauss - bonnet theorem ( see , e.g. , @xcite pp 139 , 143 ) can be combined to give @xmath11 next , consider a smooth curve @xmath12 of unit speed such that @xmath13 , and let @xmath14 be the unit acceleration vector .",
    "this vector , then , is perpendicular to @xmath15 and hence spans a frenet frame together with @xmath15 .",
    "the geodesic curvature of @xmath16 is therefore given by ( see , e.g. , @xcite p 138 ) @xmath17 which clearly vanishes if , and only if , @xmath16 is a geodesic .",
    "we will now describe two specific setups for the domain , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which will represent the weak deflection lensing geometries discussed in section 4 , and are shown in figure [ fig : gaussbonnet ] .     and",
    "@xmath20 from the source @xmath21 to the observer @xmath22 are deflected by a lens with centre at @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are two domains with boundary curves @xmath24 and @xmath25 as discussed in the text . ]",
    "firstly , let @xmath18 be bounded by two geodesics @xmath26 intersecting in two vertices , the first being the source @xmath21 , and the second the observer @xmath22 .",
    "hence @xmath27 except at the source and observer where the interior angles are @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "@xmath18 contains the lens centre @xmath23 , and both @xmath21 and @xmath22 are assumed to be very distant from @xmath23 such that @xmath30 and @xmath31 are small and positive .",
    "if the lens centre is non - singular , then @xmath18 is simply connected so that @xmath32 . on the other hand , if @xmath23 is singular , then @xmath33 and there is a contribution to @xmath34 given by the boundary curve @xmath24 enclosing @xmath23 .",
    "hence the gauss - bonnet theorem ( [ gb ] ) yields @xmath35 in the non - singular case , and @xmath36 in the singular case .",
    "secondly , let @xmath19 be a simply connected domain such that @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath19 be asymptotically flat such that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are in this regime .",
    "thus @xmath39 consists of a geodesic @xmath40 from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , and the perimeter curve @xmath25 of a circular sector centred on @xmath23 intersecting @xmath40 in @xmath21 and @xmath22 at right angles .",
    "if @xmath41 is the angular coordinate centred on @xmath23 , then @xmath42 has angular range @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the small and positive , asymptotic deflection angle of @xmath40 .",
    "therefore we can use ( [ gb ] ) to write @xmath45 again using @xmath46 . by construction , the calculation of the deflection angle according to ( [ gb3 ] ) is obviously independent of any singularity that may occur at @xmath23 in @xmath18 .",
    "we shall now consider null geodesics deflected by a static , spherically symmetric massive body consisting of a perfect fluid . in the present context , this is to be thought of as the stellar fluid of a galaxy acting as a gravitational lens .",
    "the corresponding line element written in schwarzschild coordinates @xmath47 is given by ( e.g. , see @xcite p 375 ) @xmath48\\rmd t^2+\\exp[2b(r)]\\rmd r^2+r^2\\left(\\rmd \\theta^2+\\sin^2\\vartheta \\rmd \\phi^2\\right ) .",
    "\\label{metric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by spherical symmetry , we can assume , without loss of generality , that the null geodesics with @xmath49 are in the equatorial plane @xmath50 .",
    "all images are therefore collinear with the lens centre @xmath23 in this case",
    ". spatial projection of the null geodesics yields the light rays , and these are geodesics of the optical metric @xmath51 , by fermat s principle .",
    "the geometry of the optical metric , also known as optical reference geometry , is useful for the study of gravitational and inertial forces in general relativity @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a radial regge - wheeler tortoise coordinate @xmath52 defined by @xmath53,\\ ] ] so that the line element of the optical metric becomes @xmath54\\rmd r^2+\\exp(-2a)r^2\\rmd \\phi^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\rmd r^{*2}+f(r^*)^2\\rmd \\phi^2 \\label{optmetric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from ( [ metric ] ) , where @xmath55r , \\ r = r(r^*)$ ] .",
    "it is clear , then , that the equatorial plane in the optical metric is a surface of revolution when it is embedded , where possible , in @xmath56 .",
    "its ( intrinsic ) gaussian curvature @xmath6 ( e.g. , see @xcite p 66 ) can be found from ( [ optmetric ] ) and expressed in terms of the schwarzschild radial coordinate @xmath57 , @xmath58\\left(\\frac{\\rmd a}{\\rmd r}\\frac{\\rmd b}{\\rmd r}-\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\rmd a}{\\rmd r}-\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\rmd b}{\\rmd r}-\\frac{\\rmd^2 a}{\\rmd r^2}\\right ) . \\label{gauss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can now specialize to the perfect fluid case .",
    "then the energy - momentum tensor is @xmath59 in the local flat metric , where @xmath60 denotes the density and @xmath61 the pressure of the lens model .",
    "now from einstein s field equations ( e.g. , see @xcite pp 3767 ) , @xmath62=1-\\frac{2\\mu(r)}{r } \\qquad \\mbox{where } \\qquad \\mu(r)=4\\pi g \\int_0^r \\rho(r')r'^2 \\rmd r ' . \\label{b}\\ ] ] the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor , together with the field equations , gives rise to the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation @xmath63 which expresses the hydrostatic equilibrium , and we also have @xmath64 hence using ( [ gauss ] ) , the gaussian curvature is @xmath65}{r^3\\left(1-\\frac{2\\mu}{r}\\right)^2}\\left\\{1-\\frac{3\\mu}{2r}-\\frac{4\\pi gr^3}{\\mu}\\left[\\rho\\left(1-\\frac{2\\mu}{r}\\right)+p\\left(1-\\frac{3\\mu}{r}-2\\pi gp r^2\\right)\\right]\\right\\}.\\ ] ] since we are presently interested in weak deflections only , one can limit the discussion to a non - relativistic stellar fluid subject to the collisionless boltzmann equation ( e.g. @xcite ) . but",
    "this means that the pressure may be neglected in ( [ gauss ] ) . to see this ,",
    "recall that non - relativistic kinetic theory , for instance in the case of an isotropic velocity dispersion @xmath66 , implies that @xmath67 but @xmath68 .",
    "now the area element of the equatorial plane in the optical metric is @xmath69r \\rmd r \\rmd \\phi\\ ] ] from ( [ optmetric ] ) .",
    "together with ( [ b ] ) , the integrand of the gaussian curvature therefore reduces to @xmath70\\rmd r \\rmd \\phi . \\label{gauss2}\\ ] ] notice that for realistic lens models , where @xmath71 as @xmath72 , and @xmath73 as @xmath74 , the gaussian curvature must change sign at some radius in the equatorial plane . for",
    "if @xmath75 , then @xmath76 has to decrease faster than @xmath77 for @xmath78 to be asymptotically finite , so @xmath79 follows immediately from ( [ gauss2 ] ) .",
    "conversely , if @xmath72 , then @xmath80 by ( [ b ] ) , so the term in the square bracket in ( [ gauss2 ] ) tends to @xmath81 , and the result follows .    in the next section",
    ", we shall discuss three particular lens models as examples .",
    "the schwarzschild lens can be characterized by @xmath82 and @xmath83 so that outside the event horizon at @xmath84 , @xmath85 from ( [ gauss2 ] ) .",
    "the optical schwarzschild metric has therefore negative gaussian curvature , and an embedding diagram illustrating this can be found e.g. in @xcite .",
    "now , in light of this fact , it might appear surprising at first glance that light rays can be focused .",
    "for consider a geodesic @xmath86 separated from a neighbouring geodesic by a jacobi field @xmath87 , then the geodesic deviation equation becomes ( see , e.g. , @xcite p 102 ) @xmath88 implying that the light rays should diverge .",
    "however , given a domain @xmath18 as described in section 2 , the focusing of two light rays at the observer s vertex @xmath22 is made possible by the non - trival topology of @xmath18 such that @xmath33 because of the event horizon .",
    "it is convenient to use the circular photon orbit at @xmath89 as inner boundary curve @xmath24 because its geodesic curvature vanishes .",
    "then equation ( [ gb2 ] ) applies , @xmath90 which can clearly be fulfilled for small , positive @xmath91 despite the negative gaussian curvature .",
    "the topological contribution is therefore essential to the focusing , and it is in this sense that gravitational lensing can be understood as a topological effect .",
    "in fact , its global nature is also borne out by equation ( [ gb3 ] ) . here , the deflection angle is calculated by integrating the gaussian curvature in the domain @xmath19 outwards from the light ray , as opposed to the usual treatment where the deflection is determined by the mass enclosed within the impact parameter ( e.g. @xcite p 231 and @xcite p 277 ) . now",
    "since the optical schwarzschild metric is asymptotically euclidean , we can take @xmath92 on the circular boundary of @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , because of the weak deflection limit , we may assume that the light ray is given by @xmath93 at zeroth order with impact parameter @xmath94 .",
    "hence ( [ gb3 ] ) together with ( [ schwarz ] ) implies @xmath95 this is the well - known formula for the schwarzschild deflection angle in the weak limit ( e.g. , @xcite p 25 ) , as required .",
    "finally , it should be remarked that the negative gaussian curvature of the optical metric is a rather general feature of black hole metrics , as is the closed photon orbit forming part of @xmath39 .",
    "the existence of photon spheres for static , spherically symmetric metrics was first discussed in @xcite , and more generally , in terms of an energy condition , in @xcite . a fuller discussion of the schwarzschild case , including applications of the gauss - bonnet theorem to geodesic triangles , can be found in the forthcoming article @xcite .",
    "the next example is one of the simplest realistic ( in the sense of section 3 ) models for a stellar system , the plummer sphere @xcite .",
    "it is a polytrope with density distribution ( e.g. , @xcite p 225 ) @xmath96^{-5/2 } \\label{plummer1}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is the central density and @xmath98 a scale radius , so that the mass parameter defined in ( [ b ] ) becomes @xmath99^{-3/2}. \\label{plummer2}\\ ] ] the corresponding metric is therefore an interior solution with finite @xmath100 proportional to the total newtonian mass of this model in the non - relativistic limit where @xmath101 .",
    "we can now compute the gaussian curvature integrand from ( [ gauss2 ] ) to first order in @xmath102 , to obtain @xmath103 where a dimensionless radius @xmath104 has been introduced for convenience . since @xmath78 is finite at large radii ,",
    "the optical metric of the plummer sphere approximates the optical metric of the schwarzschild lens and its negative gaussian curvature at large radii .",
    "of course , there is no event horizon in this model , so the lens centre @xmath23 is non - singular , and the domain @xmath18 is simply connected .",
    "then the relevant form of the gauss - bonnet theorem ( [ gb1 ] ) requires that @xmath105 somewhere in @xmath18 for focusing to be possible .",
    "indeed , it can be seen from ( [ plummer3 ] ) that the leading term of the gaussian curvature changes sign at @xmath106 , and this is in agreement with the more general conclusion mentioned in section 3 .",
    "we can now calculate the deflection angle for the plummer model by considering the domain @xmath19 as in the previous example . from ( [ gb3 ] ) and ( [ plummer3 ] ) , @xmath107\\rmd u \\rmd \\phi \\\\ & = \\frac{4\\mu_\\infty}{r_0}\\frac{b}{r_0}\\left[1+\\left(\\frac{b}{r_0}\\right)^2\\right]^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after suitable substitutions .",
    "this is the weak deflection angle as expected ( e.g. , @xcite p 245 ) , and we recover the schwarzschild deflection angle ( [ schwarz2 ] ) in the appropriate limit @xmath108 .      the last model discussed here is the singular isothermal sphere .",
    "fully relativistic , isothermal solutions of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation exist @xcite , and the density distribution of the singular isothermal sphere is , in fact , similar to the global monopole @xcite .",
    "however , since we are presently concerned with the weak deflection limit , it suffices to consider the non - relativistic , singular isothermal sphere with the following density distribution ( see , e.g. , @xcite pp 28990 and @xcite p 2268 ) and mass parameter , @xmath109 using ( [ b ] ) , where @xmath110 is again the isotropic velocity dispersion of the stellar fluid .",
    "this model is a solution of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation ( [ tov ] ) in the non - relativistic limit , that is , to first order in @xmath66 .",
    "then ( [ gauss2 ] ) shows that the gaussian curvature vanishes for @xmath111 in this limit , so that the equatorial plane in the optical metric is a cone with a singular vertex at @xmath112 .",
    "another way to see this is to isometrically embed the optical metric ( [ optmetric ] ) in @xmath56 with cylindrical coordinates @xmath113 such that @xmath114\\rmd r^2+\\exp(-2a)r^2\\rmd \\phi^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\rmd z(r)^2+\\rmd r(r)^2+r(r)^2\\rmd \\phi^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the equations ( [ b ] ) , ( [ a ] ) and ( [ iso1 ] ) , one can find the coefficients of the spacetime metric ( [ metric ] ) , @xmath115 where @xmath116 is a non - zero constant .",
    "then the embedding yields @xmath117 and the equatorial plane in the optical metric is described by a cone in @xmath56 of the form @xmath118 in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "this corresponds to a deficit angle of @xmath119 .",
    "now in order to find the deflection angle , we can again apply gauss - bonnet in the form of equation ( [ gb3 ] ) which reads @xmath120 since @xmath121 in @xmath19 .",
    "the gaussian curvature of the circular perimeter curve @xmath25 can be calculated directly from ( [ kappa ] ) , @xmath122 using ( [ a ] ) .",
    "the leading term of the deflection angle is therefore @xmath123 from ( [ iso2 ] ) , in agreement with the standard treatment ( e.g. , @xcite p 290 ) .",
    "this shows that , from this point of view , the constant deflection angle of the singular isothermal sphere comes essentially from the deficit angle of the conical optical metric , similar to cosmic string lensing ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "in this article , we have introduced a geometrical approach to gravitational lensing theory different from the spacetime and impulse approximation treatments . by applying the gauss - bonnet theorem to the optical metric , whose geodesics are the spatial light rays",
    ", we found that the focusing of light rays can be regarded as a topological effect .",
    "we also gave a new expression ( [ gb3 ] ) to calculate the deflection angle by integrating the gaussian curvature of the optical metric outwards from the light ray , in the weak deflection limit .",
    "the lens models considered were given by static , spherically symmetric bodies of a non - relativistic , perfect fluid , and we discussed as examples the schwarzschild lens , the plummer sphere and the singular isothermal sphere .",
    "it would therefore be interesting to see whether this approach could also be extended and be fruitfully applied to lenses without spherical symmetry , where images are no longer collinear with the lens centre , or to the relativistic strong deflection limit .",
