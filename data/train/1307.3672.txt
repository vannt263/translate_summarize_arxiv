    "<S> in this paper we propose and analyze a method based on the riccati transformation for solving the evolutionary hamilton - jacobi - bellman equation arising from the stochastic dynamic optimal allocation problem . </S>",
    "<S> we show how the fully nonlinear hamilton - jacobi - bellman equation can be transformed into a quasi - linear parabolic equation whose diffusion function is obtained as the value function of certain parametric convex optimization problem . although the diffusion function need not be sufficiently smooth , we are able to prove existence , uniqueness and derive useful bounds of classical hlder smooth solutions . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore construct a fully implicit iterative numerical scheme based on finite volume approximation of the governing equation . </S>",
    "<S> a numerical solution is compared to a semi - explicit traveling wave solution by means of the convergence ratio of the method . </S>",
    "<S> we compute optimal strategies for a portfolio investment problem motivated by the german dax 30 index as an example of application of the method . </S>"
