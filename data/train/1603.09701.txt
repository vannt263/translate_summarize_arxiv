    "the problem of analyzing complex behaviors of large social , economic and biological networks based on generative recursive and probabilistic models has been the subject of intense study in graph theory , machine learning and statistics . in these settings ,",
    "one often assumes the existence of attachment and preference rules for network formation , or imposes constraints on subgraph structures as well as vertex and edge features that govern the creation of network communities  @xcite .",
    "models of this type have been used to successfully predict network dynamics and topology fluctuations , infer network community properties and preferences , determine the bottlenecks and rates of spread of information and commodities and elucidate functional and structural properties of individual network modules  @xcite .",
    "several measures for assessing the quality of graph family models for social or biological networks include _ the vertex degree distribution , the graph diameter and clustering coefficient ( i.e. , density of triangles)_. the vertex degree distribution describes the number of vertices of each degree in the graph , and is usually assumed to follow a power - law , with the probability of an arbitrary vertex having degree @xmath0 scaling as @xmath1 , for some parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the diameter of a graph is the length of the longest shortest path between any two vertices of a graph , and is known to be a small constant for most known social and biological networks  @xcite .",
    "the clustering index constraint ensures that the model correctly contains a large number of network motifs ( e.g. , triangles ) known to exist in both biological and social networks ( here , we use the word `` motif '' to refer to a small induced subgraph which appears in networks with a probability significantly higher than that predicted by some random generative model ) . in his comprehensive study of social network motifs ,",
    "ugander  @xcite determined the frequency of induced subgraphs with three and four vertices in a large cohort of interaction and friendship networks .",
    "in addition to showing that triangles ( cliques with three vertices , @xmath3 ) and cliques with four vertices , @xmath4 , are the most prominent network motifs , ugander also established the existence of strong _ anti - motifs _ , highly infrequent induced subgraphs .",
    "for example , cycles of length four ( @xmath5 ) represent the least likely induced subgraphs in social networks .    here ,",
    "we take a new approach to deterministic network modeling by proposing a new family of graph structures that have small diameter , avoid anti - motifs of real social and biological networks and include graphs with good clustering coefficients . the graphs in question , termed doubly threshold ( dt ) graphs , may be succinctly defined as follows : each vertex is assigned a nonnegative weight .",
    "an edge between two vertices exists if the sum of the vertex weights exceeds a certain threshold , while at the same time , the difference between the weights remains bounded by another prescribed threshold .",
    "dt graphs may be seen as a generalization of two classes of graphs : threshold and unit interval graphs .",
    "threshold graphs were introduced by chvatal and hammer  @xcite in order to solve a set - packing problem ; they are defined by the first generative property of dt graphs , stating that an edge between two vertices exists if and only if the sum of their weights exceeds a predetermined threshold .",
    "threshold graphs are often referred to as `` rich people networks , '' as the weights may be associated with wealth , in which case the generative rule is interpreted as `` rich people always know each other '' or `` everyone knows the rich people ''  @xcite . as discussed in more details in the next section , the vertex weight assignment of threshold graphs can be easily obtained from the degrees of the vertices ; furthermore , graphs in this family may be constructed recursively , by adding what are called isolated or dominating vertices based on simple attachment rules .",
    "most importantly , the graphs may be completely quantified by three forbidden induced subgraphs , @xmath6 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : tgforbidden ] ) . as a result",
    ", threshold graphs have been used as social network models and have also found other applications in aggregation of inequalities , synchronization and cyclic scheduling  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "unit interval graphs were introduced in  @xcite . these graphs are also defined in terms of constrained vertex weights , so that the difference of the weights of every two adjacent vertices lies below a predefined threshold . and @xmath5 ; and graphs  @xcite .",
    "]    dt graphs , as already pointed out , combine the threshold and unit interval graph constraints in a manner that ensures that two vertices are connected by an edge if and only if their joint wealth ( i.e. , sum of weights ) is above some threshold @xmath8 , and their wealths ( weights ) do not disagree by more than some other threshold @xmath9 .",
    "as such , dt graphs may be interpreted as networks of `` sufficiently wealthy people within the same economic class '' , where the same economic class constraint arises from the requirement that the wealths are of comparable size .",
    "many other interpretations are possible , for example by assuming that the weights represent the number of papers published in a given topic area and links describing coauthorship ( two researchers are likely to be coauthors of a paper on a given topic if they jointly published a certain number of papers in the field and are of matching research experience ) , two people are likely to coinvest in a project if they total wealth exceeds the value of the investment capital needed and their investment contributions are comparable etc . as will be shown in subsequent sections",
    ", dt graphs also have special hierarchical community structures that capture a number of important properties of real social networks .",
    "furthermore , they may be modeled in a probabilistic setting , in which one assumes that the vertices satisfying the constraints are connected by an edge with probability @xmath10 , while vertices not satisfying the constraints are not connected with probability @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , as will be shown in subsequent sections , dt graphs avoid induced subgraphs that are also avoided in real social networks , such as @xmath5 .",
    "although the focus of this work is on combinatorial dt graphs with scalar weights and their analysis , the underlying model may be easily generalized to include vector weights , and weight assignments that follow some distribution ( e.g. , uniform or gaussian ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ preli ] ,",
    "we briefly review relevant definitions and concepts from graph theory and introduce dt graphs . in section  [ dtg ] , we characterize the topological properties of dt graphs and some of their forbidden induced subgraphs , and describe a simple decomposition of the graphs .",
    "this decomposition allows one to find a vertex weight assignment that satisfies the dt graph constraints . in section",
    "[ algorithm ] , we provide a polynomial - time algorithm for identifying whether a graph is dt or not . in section  [ sec :",
    "social ] , using the previously devised dt graphs decomposition , we first describe a number of forbidden induced subgraphs of dt graphs and then provide closed formulas for the intersection number and the clustering coefficient of dt graphs as well as a bound on the diameter of dt graphs .",
    "we start by introducing relevant definitions and by providing an overview of basic properties of threshold graphs .    [",

    "two vertices @xmath17 , @xmath18 , are said to be _ adjacent _ if there exists an edge in @xmath16 , herein denoted by @xmath19 , connecting them . for every @xmath20 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath21 the set of the vertices adjacent to @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath23 the cardinality of @xmath21 , denoted by @xmath24 , is referred to as the degree of vertex @xmath22 .",
    "a graph @xmath14 is called a _ threshold graph _ if there exists a fixed @xmath25 , and a weight function @xmath26 such that for all distinct @xmath17 : @xmath27 we will refer to such a threshold graph as a @xmath28 graph  @xcite .",
    "threshold graphs may be equivalently defined as those graphs that avoid @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath6 as induced subgraphs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tgforbidden ] ) .",
    "furthermore , threshold graphs may be generated using a recursive procedure , by sequentially adding an isolated vertex ( a vertex not connected to any previously added vertices ) or a dominating vertex ( a vertex connected to all previously added vertices ) .",
    "threshold graphs can also be alternatively characterized via what is called the  _ vicinal preorder _",

    "given a threshold graph with threshold @xmath36 and vertex weights @xmath37 , it is straightforward to show that @xmath38 therefore , since the preorder @xmath39 on the set @xmath13 is total , the preorder @xmath29 on @xmath30 is total as well .",

    "let @xmath429 be a path with @xmath444 edges from @xmath56 to a vertex @xmath286 .",
    "if @xmath445 , then @xmath436 is a @xmath438-path of length @xmath446 .",
    "the diameter of most known social networks is known to be a small constant : for example , the _ small world phenomena _",
    "@xcite suggests that the diameter of the underlying graphs is close to @xmath448 .",
    "since the diameter of a dt graph with distance decomposition @xmath417 is at most @xmath449 , the question arises whether or not a given dt graph has a decomposition with @xmath450 .",
    "to answer this question , we use the decomposition algorithm described in the previous section . we know that in a @xmath251-max partition , the vertices that possibly lie in @xmath255 are the vertices at distance at most @xmath266 from @xmath251 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath451 and there is a vertex at distance greater than @xmath423 from @xmath251 , then that vertex has to be in @xmath257 in any @xmath251-max partition , and will therefore be in a clique at distance @xmath449 from the threshold graph .",
    "conversely , any vertex at distance at least @xmath449 from the threshold graph is also at distance @xmath449 from @xmath251 .",
    "so , for @xmath451 , there is a partition with at most @xmath423 layers in the unit - interval graph if and only if there is some vertex @xmath251 such that ( 1 ) every vertex is within distance @xmath423 of @xmath251 , and ( 2 ) the graph has a @xmath251-max partition .    for the special case @xmath452 , it is no longer necessary that every vertex is within distance @xmath227 of @xmath251 , but the only way this is possible is if every vertex at distance @xmath266 from @xmath251 is in @xmath255 .",
    "these vertices are isolated vertices in the threshold graph .",
    "therefore , for each such vertex , we can add ( @xmath453 ) as an additional constraint to the 2sat problem and search for a vertex @xmath251 such that the modified 2sat problem has a solution .",
    "this would produce the desired decomposition .",
    "for the special case @xmath454 , one only needs to check whether the graph is a threshold graph without isolates , which is straightforward to do , and as already mentioned , such graphs have diameter at most @xmath266 .",
    "the global clustering coefficient of a graph is defined based on counts of triplets of vertices  @xcite ( a triplet consists of three connected vertices ) .",
    "a triangle in the graph includes three closed triplets , one centered on each of the vertices .",
    "more formally , the global clustering coefficient is defined as : @xmath455    to calculate the clustering coefficient of a dt graph , we again use a distance decomposition of the graph , say @xmath417 .",
    "assume that @xmath456 is a connected dt graph with @xmath457 vertices , and assume that using ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ hoof ] ) , the order of the vertices of @xmath57 has been established as @xmath458 . in case",
    "that two vertices are assigned the same ranking within the order , we randomly break the tie .",
    "let @xmath459 be a set in which @xmath460 is the degree of the @xmath22-th vertex in @xmath57 , for @xmath461 ; i.e. @xmath462 .",
    "now , we provide closed formulas for the numerator and the denominator of ( [ clus - coef ] ) .    *",
    "clearly , the number of triplets in each graph equals @xmath463 .",
    "so , the denominator of ( [ clus - coef ] ) may be obtained using the degree sequence of the vertices of the graph . * the numerator in the expression for the clustering coefficient",
    "may be found using the properties of dt graphs .",
    "recall the definition of @xmath464 in theorem  [ thm : nplus ] and let @xmath465 .",
    "then , the number of triangles equals @xmath466 . to see this ,",
    "first consider a vertex @xmath22 and the set @xmath464 .",
    "let @xmath467,where @xmath468 .",
    "let @xmath231 .",
    "if @xmath469 , or @xmath470 , then a triangle is formed by @xmath22 , @xmath471 and @xmath472 , as @xmath59 and @xmath161 form cliques . if @xmath473 and @xmath474 , then @xmath475 . from @xmath476 and @xmath477",
