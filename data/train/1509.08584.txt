    "the isometric embedding or immersion of two - dimensional riemannian manifolds into the three - dimensional euclidean space is a classical problem in geometry .",
    "it can be formulated as an elliptic problem if the gauss curvature is positive , a hyperbolic problem if the curvature is negative , and a mixed elliptic - hyperbolic type problem if the curvature changes signs .",
    "this problem has been extensively studied in literature and we refer the readers to the book @xcite , the papers @xcite and the references therein .",
    "in particular , there have been many studies on the elliptic case of the isometric embedding problem with positive curvature ; see the book @xcite . for the case of mixed type when the curvature changes signs , lin in @xcite and han in @xcite obtained the local isometric embedding of surfaces when the gauss curvature changes signs cleanly using the approach of the symmetric positive differential system . for the hyperbolic case with negative curvature , hong in @xcite proved the smooth isometric embedding of surfaces when the gauss curvature decays at certain rate in the time - like direction and",
    "the @xmath3 norm of the initial data is small ; the isometric immersion with large data was obtained in chen - slemrod - wang @xcite by a fluid dynamic formulation and a vanishing viscosity method for catenoid type surfaces , and in cao - huang - wang @xcite by the artificial viscosity method for both the catenoid and helicoid type surfaces ; and the isometric immersion with small bv data was also considered in christoforou @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the isometric immersion with large data for more general surfaces with negative curvatures .",
    "we remark that the results in @xcite and this paper hold for decay of order @xmath4 in the gauss curvature , and the method of compensated compactness was recently applied in christoforou - slemrod @xcite to the isometric immersion of surfaces with rough data and slowly decaying negative gauss curvature in the order @xmath5 , the same decay rate as in @xcite .",
    "the classical surface theory indicates that the isometric embedding or immersion can be realized if the first fundamental form and the second fundamental form of surfaces satisfy the gauss - codazzi equations ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . when the curvature is negative , the gauss - codazzi system is a @xmath6 hyperbolic system of balance laws .",
    "our goal of this paper is to obtain the large @xmath0 solution of the gauss - codazzi system so that the @xmath1 isometric immersion can be established ( @xcite ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the large @xmath0 solution of the gauss - codazzi system was obtained in @xcite for certain type surfaces with special given metrics . to obtain the large @xmath0 solution for more general given metrics of surfaces",
    ", we shall reformulate the system as an inhomogeneous system of chaplygin gas dynamics , use the lax - friedrichs type finite - difference scheme with the fractional step ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) to construct the approximate solutions , and apply the compensated compactness framework in @xcite to show the convergence and obtain the global large @xmath0 solution of the system . as in @xcite ,",
    "the hardest and most important part is to establish the @xmath0 uniform estimate . in this paper",
    "we shall take the advantage of the sign of nonlinear part in the discrete ordinary differential equations ( odes ) satisfied by the riemann invariants to obtain the uniform @xmath0 estimate via the invariant regions .",
    "one of our observations is that the invariant regions are contained only in the region where the two riemann invariants have different signs , which is also true in @xcite . through the fractional lax - friedrichs scheme ,",
    "we obtain the uniform @xmath0 bound of the approximate solutions with arbitrarily large initial data .",
    "our results contain more manifolds than those in @xcite , in which only helicoid and catenoid type manifolds are included .",
    "then we apply the compensated compactness framework proved in @xcite for the gauss - codazzi system to obtain the existence of global weak solution in @xmath0 which yields an isometric immersion of surfaces .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we first normalize the state variables and reformulate the gauss - codazzi system as an inhomogeneous system of chaplygin gas dynamics .",
    "then we recall some basic properties of the riemann solutions to the homogeneous chaplygin gas dynamics , construct the approximate solutions to the inhomogeneous system with the help of lax - friedrichs scheme and the fractional step , and give the definition of weak solutions . in section 3",

    "isometric embedding or immersion of two or higher dimensional riemannian manifolds is a classical problem , which attracts lots of interest of many mathematicians , such as cartan , codazzi , janet , hong and so on .",
    "most are interested in the realization in high dimension , for example , cartan @xcite in 1927 , codazzi @xcite in 1860 , janet @xcite in 1926 , mainardi @xcite in 1856 , peterson @xcite in 1853 and so on . as in @xcite ,",
    "@xmath8dimension manifold can be embedded in janet dimension i.e. @xmath9 or higher dimension euclidian space .",
    "naturally , geometricians try their best to realize the given metric into the euclidian space with best dimension , but it is difficult . however , there is some development in two dimensional manifold .",
    "actually , in two dimensional case , the corresponding janet dimension is 3 , and it is reduced to solve the well - known gauss - codazzi system , or darboux equation because the classical surface theory indicates that the given metric can be realized if the first fundamental form and the second fundamental form satisfy the gauss - codazzi equations ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . after detecting carefully",
    ", we will find that the equations are of changing types , which are elliptic type if gauss curvature is positive , hyperbolic type if gauss curvature is negative , and mixed type if the gauss curvature changing sign .",
    "provided the corresponding pde theory , there are many results of isometric embedding in the case of positive gauss curvature , see @xcite and the references therein . besides , hong in @xcite proved the isometric immersion in @xmath10 of completely negative curved surfaces with the negative gauss curvature decaying at a certain rate in the time - like direction , but the @xmath3 norm of initial data of the gauss - codazzi system is samll so that he can obtain the smooth solution .",
    "for the mixed type case , lin in @xcite and han in @xcite obtained local isometric embedding of surfaces with gauss curvature changing sign cleanly using symmetric positive differential system , which is a useful tool in handing differential system of mixed type .    in the present paper ,",
    "we concentrate on finding global weak solutions of gauss - codazzi system with general initial data and then obtain the realization of a relatively more general metric , comparing with @xcite . after some normalization of the state variants , we formulate the system into inhomogeneous chaplygin gas dynamic system .",
    "then we can utilize lax - friedrichs scheme to construct discrete approximate solution to the system and obtain @xmath0 weak solution using the compactness framework in @xcite as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the lax - friedrichs scheme has been used to gain the existence of general homogeneous or inhomogeneous gas dynamic system , ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . similar to @xcite , the hardest and most important part is how to get @xmath0 estimate .",
    "here we take advantage of the sign of nonlinear part in the discrete odes satisfied by rieamann invariants and cauchy inequality to obtain the uniformly @xmath0 estimate and get the so called extended invariant region .",
    "the other two estimates @xmath7 compactness and approximation in the framework are standard and easy to be handed . with three conditions in the framework satisfied , we gain more general result .",
    "what s more , from the discrete odes satisfied by riemann invariants , we discover the reason why the obtained invariants regions are only contained in the region where the two riemann invariants have different signs , which is suited for @xcite .",
    "we also believe that using invariant region method to gain uniformly @xmath0 estimate has the above restrict and we have obtained the best result with the method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we normalize the state variants and reformulate gauss - codazzi system to inhomogeneous chaplygin gas dynamics .",
    "it contains three subsections .",
    "the first one is devoted to study the homogeneous chaplygin gas dynamics , and the second one is constructing approximate solutions to the gas dynamic equations with the help of lax - friedrichs scheme .",
    "the third one is giving the definition of weak solutions to gauss - codazzi system .",
    "in section 3 , we establish the @xmath0 estimate for more general metric comparing with @xcite by careful studying the equations satisfied by riemann invariants . in section 4 ,",
    "we prove the @xmath7 compactness utilizing the method of @xcite . in section 5 , combining the above two estimates and the compensated compactness framework in @xcite we provide and prove our main theorems on the existence of weak solutions to the gauss - codazzi system .",
    "for a two - dimensional riemannian manifold parametrized by @xmath11 in an open set of @xmath12 with the given metric @xmath13 , and the second fundamental form @xmath14 , as in @xcite the gauss - codazzi system for the isometric embedding of the two - dimensional riemannian manifold into @xmath10 is the following : @xmath15 where @xmath16 @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the gauss curvature which is equal to the following : @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the christoffel symbol with @xmath21 denoting the inverse of @xmath22 and @xmath23 . here",

    "hence the riemann solutions of ( [ ho ] ) with piecewise constant initial data are in the invariant region of the initial data .    more precisely , for the riemann solution of ( [ ho ] ) with the given initial data @xmath68 , the state @xmath69 can only be connected to @xmath68 on the right by a contact discontinuity wave ( cdw ) since the hyperbolic system ( [ ho ] ) is linearly degenerate .",
