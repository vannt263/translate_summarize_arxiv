    "relaxation to thermal boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium in @xmath0-particle hamiltonian systems with long - range interactions has been recently the subject of an intense debate  @xcite . in some cases",
    ", the relaxation time has been shown to be extremely long and to increase with the number of particles .",
    "hence , the study of these out - of - equilibrium conditions is of paramount importance for physical applications .",
    "the dynamics of systems with long - range interactions shows that some states are attained quickly , on time scales of @xmath4 , and that afterwards the system evolves very slowly , on time scales diverging with @xmath0 , towards boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium .",
    "we call states that evolve on time scales that diverge with @xmath0 `` quasi - stationary '' .",
    "some of them are characterized by a particle distribution in the @xmath5-space , @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 the position and conjugate momentum of the @xmath8-th particle and @xmath9 the dirac function ) , which remains close to a slowly varying smooth distribution for times that increase with @xmath0 .",
    "it should be remarked that most of the numerical evidences of this behavior are for @xmath10 and @xmath11 systems .",
    "the theoretical explanation we propose in this paper , which is developed for mean - field models , extends to any dimension , as soon as the two body interaction is sufficiently smooth .",
    "many recent studies of such quasi - stationary states are performed for the so - called hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model ( for a review see ref .",
    "this model describes the motion of @xmath0 rotators under the action of an attractive or repulsive infinite range cosine interaction . in this paper",
    "we will consider the attractive case .",
    "the model then displays a second order phase transition , which is related to the development of a dynamical instability of the spatially homogeneous initial state with gaussian distribution of momenta , at a given value of the energy  @xcite .",
    "the analysis developed in this paper is based on a theorem due to braun and hepp  @xcite , according to which the dynamics of a classical @xmath0-particle system interacting via a two body and sufficiently regular long - range potential is well approximated by the associated vlasov dynamics of the density in @xmath5-space . in the case in which the interaction force derives from a two - body smooth potential , vlasov equation writes @xmath12 the mean field macroscopic potential @xmath13 is a functional of the probability distribution function @xmath14 , which makes the equation nonlinear in @xmath15 .",
    "more precisely , braun - hepp s theorem states that , for a mean - field microscopic two - body smooth potential , the distance between two initially close  weak \" solutions of the vlasov equation increases at most exponentially in time .",
    "the theorem applies also to singular distributions , e.g. distributions that have a support on a set of dimension smaller than the one of the @xmath5-space ( for instance , a line in the two dimensional @xmath5-space of the hmf model ) .",
    "if we apply this result to a large @xmath0 particle approximation of a continuous distribution the error at @xmath16 is typically of order @xmath17 , thus for any  small \" @xmath18 and any  large enough \" particle number @xmath0 , there is a time @xmath19 up to which the dynamics of the original hamiltonian and its vlasov description coincide within an error bounded by  @xmath18 .",
    "the theorem implies that this time  @xmath19 increases at least as @xmath20 .",
    "extensions to wave particle dynamics of such a result have also been reported recently  @xcite .",
    "since quasi - stationary states evolve on time scales that diverge with  @xmath0 , this result suggests that these states might gain their stability from being `` close '' to some stable stationary states of the vlasov dynamics .    besides the conserved quantities of the hamiltonian dynamics ( energy , momentum , angular momentum ... ) , the vlasov description introduces additional integrals : the so - called casimirs @xmath21=\\int s \\left(f(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{p},t)\\right ) \\ , d\\mathbf{r } d\\mathbf{p}\\ , , \\ ] ] for any function  @xmath22 .",
    "these conservation laws are responsible for the existence of an infinity of stable stationary states for the vlasov dynamics . in this paper",
    ", we will argue that the existence of this infinity of stationary states is a possible explanation for the generic existence of quasi - stationary states in the finite @xmath0-dynamics .",
    "this interpretation rises the following questions .",
    "may one predict the quasi - stationary states that emerge after a complex unstable vlasov dynamics ? among these stationary states , are there some `` statistically preferred '' states ? what governs the relaxation towards equilibrium of the stationary states , and which is the scaling of the relaxation time with the number of particles ?",
    "we will address in this paper the first and the third question , while the issues related to the second question will be only briefly mentioned .",
    "before the slow relaxation phase sets in , a fast evolution takes place on a time scale that is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "this phenomenon is denoted as _ violent relaxation _ in the astrophysical context  @xcite , and is a consequence of the nonlinear complex dynamics of the vlasov equation .",
    "after this very rapid stage , vlasov dynamics produces thinner and thinner filamentations of the density @xmath15 , which lead to an apparent equilibrium described by a coarse grained density function @xmath23 .",
    "a statistical mechanics interpretation of this process has been proposed : for instance , for an initial two level density function , the equilibrium density is of fermi - dirac type  @xcite . even if this may be already a partial answer to our second question above , we will not address in detail the very delicate point of the convergence of the vlasov dynamics towards _ its _ statistical equilibrium in the present paper .",
    "some authors  @xcite have advanced a challenging interpretation of the quasi - stationary states , suggesting that they should be true  equilibrium \" states , obtained by maximizing the tsallis  @xcite entropy of the single particle distribution .",
    "we think that a landmark of such an interpretation would be the assessment of the existence of power law tails in the single particle momentum ( or energy ) distributions .",
    "although we will not enter into a detailed fitting of such distributions using tsallis @xmath3-exponentials , we will present a strong evidence of the absence of power law tails in the single particle momentum distribution at any stage of the time evolution , for the whole class of initial conditions we investigate in this paper , that are all homogeneous in space ( see section  [ sec : long - time ] ) . for an initial condition in which the particles are concentrated in a point and momentum",
    "is uniform in an interval around zero , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have been able to fit a tsallis @xmath3-exponential to the central part of the momentum distribution , after imposing an arbitrary cut - off to the tails .",
    "however , these authors do not exhibit any evidence of existence of power law tails , even for such a special initial state .",
    "moreover , as mentioned above , our analysis applies also to this initial condition although it does nt correspond to a stationary state of the vlasov equation . at best",
    ", tsallis statistics could describe the quasi - stationary states obtained from such a special initial state , but certainly not all of them , in particular those originated from the large class of homogeneous states that are studied in this paper .    moreover , the steadily progressing dynamical evolution observed for our class of initial conditions does not show any intermediate `` statistically preferred '' state .",
    "as stated above , the time evolution follows a sequence of stationary vlasov states until , asymptotically , boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium is attained .",
    "it should be however mentioned that the special initial state studied in  @xcite is very interesting from a dynamical point of view , since it shows long - time correlations that are absent for the homogeneous initial states studied here ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "similar initial states produce fractal structures in the @xmath5-space for a self - gravitating sheet model  @xcite .    as discussed above",
    ", braun - hepp s theorem suggests that the similarity between hamiltonian @xmath0-particle dynamics and vlasov dynamics persists for times that increase as @xmath20 .",
    "these times are linked with the fastest possible instability of the vlasov dynamics . for stable solutions ,",
    "the appropriate timescale is , however , the one associated with the fluctuations of the mean field . in agreement with this theoretical remark , we present in sec .  [ sec : long - time ] numerical results that indicate that the persistence of quasi - stationary states is present up to times that are much longer than braun - hepp s @xmath20 .",
    "this time scale increases as a power law in @xmath0 with a nontrivial exponent .",
    "similar time scales have been found in gravitational systems .",
    "this is the case of chandrasekhar s  collisional \" time scale , which is of order @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "although such time scale is similar to those we find in the hmf model , because it signals the final process of relaxation to boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium , its origin in our model is certainly different .    in order to reformulate",
    "the timescale hierarchy sketched above , we can expect the following scenario :    1 .",
    "an initial and fast evolution , well described for all initial conditions by the vlasov dynamics , takes place on a timescale independent of the particle number  @xmath0 .",
    "the system is then always trapped close to one of the numerous stable stationary states of the vlasov equation .",
    "this state may be the statistical equilibrium of the vlasov equation ( the most probable state with constraints given by the vlasov invariants ) .",
    "the system slowly evolves , on a much longer time scale , due to `` collisions '' , or due to the fluctuations around this vlasov stationary state .",
    "consequently this time scale will be a function of @xmath0 .",
    "one can expect that this slow evolution takes place passing through different stable vlasov stationary states .",
    "finally , the system reaches a particular vlasov stable state , corresponding to the boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium state .",
    "we will try to give support to this scenario in the remaining of the paper .",
    "the plan is the following .",
    "we first introduce in section  [ model ] the hamiltonian mean field model .",
    "we will then show in section  [ vlasov ] that the vlasov dynamics has an infinity of stationary states and we propose a new general stability criterion for any homogeneous distribution ( including non boltzmann - gibbs ones ) .",
    "we will compare these analytical results with numerical simulations of the finite-@xmath0 hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "the rapid convergence towards a stable stationary state of the vlasov equation is described in section  [ sec : short - time ] . in the case of unstable stationary states , we show that the exponential destabilization may be investigated taking advantage of the existence of unstable modes of the vlasov dynamics , in accordance with braun - hepp s theorem .",
    "the slow evolution towards equilibrium , passing through different stable vlasov stationary states is described in section  [ sec : intermediate - time ] .",
    "we will consider the hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model , whose hamiltonian is @xmath25,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the position ( angle ) of the @xmath8-th particle on a circle and @xmath27 the corresponding momentum .",
    "this system can be seen as representing particles moving on a unit circle interacting via an infinite range attractive cosine potential , or as classical xy - rotators with infinite range ferromagnetic couplings  @xcite .",
    "the magnetization , defined as @xmath28 or more precisely its modulus , @xmath29    equilibrium statistical mechanics can be derived exactly both in the canonical and in the microcanonical ensembles  @xcite . in the ferromagnetic case , that we consider here , a minimal free energy ( maximum entropy ) state with a nonvanishing magnetization appears when lowering temperature ( resp .",
    "energy per particle ) below @xmath30 ( resp .",
    "@xmath31 ) . a discontinuity at @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) in the second derivative of the free energy ( entropy ) with respect to magnetization signals a second order phase transition . this transition is between a low energy phase with particles forming a cluster ( rotators pointing towards a preferred direction ) , and a high energy phase with particles evenly distributed on the circle ( no preferred direction for rotators ) .",
    "this theoretical result , valid in the @xmath34 limit , is also confirmed by direct numerical simulations of the equations of motion  ( [ eq : canonical ] ) , which moreover allows a careful analysis of finite @xmath0 corrections and give access to the study of non equilibrium features .",
    "it s in this context that , within the energy region @xmath35 $ ] , a class of initial states has been found that displays an extremely slow relaxation towards boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium  @xcite , with a relaxation time that increases with @xmath0 .",
    "similar phenomena occur for other particle systems with long - range interaction ( self - gravitating stars or point vortices @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , in the context of two - dimensional fluid - dynamics  @xcite and plasma physics  @xcite , the existence of an infinity of stationary states is known since a long time .",
    "these slow relaxation processes have recently attracted considerable attention , since the hmf model can be considered as a simple paradigmatic model of long - range interactions , without the two additional difficulties of gravitational dynamics : singularity at short range and particle evaporation . as briefly recalled in the introduction , latora _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have carefully analyzed an initial condition where all particles are located at the same position on the circle ( giving initially @xmath36 ) and momentum is uniformly distributed over a finite range , symmetrically around zero .",
    "the system shows a fast relaxation towards a small magnetization state which persists for an extremely long time , that increases with  @xmath0 .",
    "the authors compare the momentum distribution of such a quasi - stationary state with tsallis distributions , obtaining some convincing fit of the central part of the distribution only after they impose a cut - off to momentum tails .",
    "montemurro and zanette  @xcite , analyzing the same initial condition , have even criticized the existence of a small magnetization plateau in time , by presenting some numerical evidence that magnetization first evolves towards a minimum , and then take off again towards the higher equilibrium value .",
    "we will avoid this controversial point by using the definition of quasi - stationary state given in the introduction , i.e. we shall call quasi - stationary a state which still evolves , but on a time scale that diverges with @xmath0 .",
    "hence , macroscopic properties are well defined over a sufficiently wide time span to allow local running time averages , even though the system slowly and continuously evolves towards equilibrium .    at variance with most previous numerical experiments  @xcite",
    ", we choose here an initial state where the particles are uniformly distributed on the circle ( hence @xmath37 is initially close to zero , @xmath38 ) and momentum has a uniform distribution centered around zero , as above .",
    "we make this choice for two reasons : _ i _ ) this state is a stationary state of the vlasov equation , that describes the hmf model in the @xmath34 limit , _ ii _ ) the @xmath39 state plays a relevant role also in the previous numerical experiments  @xcite and we then thought that it is better to start directly from it . finally , we think that the analysis of the @xmath39 initial state can also clarify several aspects of the phenomenology of the @xmath36 initial state used by the authors above .",
    "as explained in the introduction , we believe that the vlasov description is a useful and appropriate tool to understand the slow relaxation process . in the following section , we introduce and discuss the vlasov equation for the hmf model .",
    "in the continuum limit , that is keeping the volume ( here the interval @xmath40 ) and the energy per particle fixed as the number of particles @xmath1 , the dynamics governed by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : canonical ] ) is described by the vlasov equation .",
    "the state of the finite @xmath0 system can be described by a single particle time - dependent density function @xmath41 where @xmath9 is the dirac function .",
    "when @xmath0 is large , it is natural to approximate the discrete density @xmath42 by a continuous one @xmath43 . using this density , also called @xmath5-space distribution , it is possible to rewrite the two components of the magnetization  @xmath37 given by eq .",

    "( [ eq : vlasov ] ) grows at most exponentially in time @xmath52 with a growth rate @xmath53 which is independent of the initial conditions .",
    "this result , which is the essence of braun - hepp s theorem , heavily relies on the mean field character of the underlying hamiltonian dynamics and on the genericity of exponential instability of trajectories .",
    "choosing then @xmath54 and taking for @xmath55 a continuous approximation of @xmath42 , one immediately obtains that @xmath56 as @xmath0 grows . as a consequence",
    ", the previous result implies that the discrete particle dynamics converges to vlasov dynamics when @xmath34 , uniformly over all fixed time intervals @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "however , for all fixed @xmath0 there is a typical time @xmath58 over which the two dynamics diverge .    from this analysis ,",
    "it is therefore natural to expect that particle and vlasov dynamics coincide during a time that diverges as @xmath20 , if @xmath59 and @xmath53 is independent of @xmath0 . however , for initial conditions corresponding to stable stationary solutions of the vlasov equation , this time may be much longer , actually of order @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "all this explains why the properties of the vlasov equation are of particular interest for the study of the particle dynamics . in the next subsection",
    ", we will study the vlasov dynamics of the hmf model and its stationary states , with the aim of getting useful insights on particle dynamics .",

    "these new conserved quantities play of course a major role in the dynamics of the vlasov equation and thus of the particle dynamics .    for a non stationary initial distribution , the dynamics of the vlasov equation",
    "is known to give rise to a very complex nonlinear evolution , characterized by stretching and folding of the initial distribution , the details of this evolution being usually unpredictable .",
    "however , one may predict the final evolution using statistical mechanics arguments , in the spirit of the statistical mechanics of two dimensional conservative flows  @xcite or of the vlasov - poisson equation  @xcite .",
    "one ends up with the most probable coarse - grained distribution @xmath64 , which takes into account the dynamical invariants .",
    "unfortunately , the dynamical mixing of the distribution is likely to be incomplete : the reason lies in the existence of infinitely many stable stationary solutions of the vlasov equation , in the neighborhood of which the system may be trapped",
    ". therefore , vlasov dynamics quickly converges ( weak convergence ) to a stable stationary state which should be studied in detail .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : magnetization_vlasov ] ) and  ( [ eq : magnetization_vlasovb ] ) show that the magnetization @xmath65 is constant for a stationary solution  @xmath66 .",
    "this implies that the potential @xmath67 is constant .",
    "the equation for the stationary states of the vlasov equation may thus be considered as a linear first order partial differential equation .",
    "solutions are then given by densities @xmath15 that are constant on the characteristics of the equation , corresponding to the level sets of the individual particle energy @xmath68 which corresponds to the energy of a pendulum .",
    "it is important to observe that the total energy @xmath69 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) , is different from the sum of the individual energies  ( [ eq : individual - energy ] ) .",
    "smooth stationary solutions of the vlasov equation are thus given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is any real function .",

    "let us note that the function  @xmath71 may be multi - valued for individual energies  @xmath77 greater than the energy of the separatrix ( one branch for particles with positive momentum and the other for negative momenta ) .",
    "we will assume that this does not happen in the remaining of the paper , for the sake of simplicity ( a generalization would be straightforward ) .",
    "as discussed above , the stationary states of the vlasov equation are not true stationary states of the particle dynamics .",
