    "the experimental hep frontier is soon reaching tev energies and most of the physicists expect that just there theoretically proposed higgs bosons and superpartners are waiting to be discovered .",
    "there are many reasons to be so optimistic .",
    "first of all , in spite of its remarkable successes , the standard model has to be extended into a more complete theory which should solve the hierarchy problem and stabilize the higgs boson mass against radiative corrections . the most attractive extension to realize these objectives is supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite .",
    "its minimal version ( mssm ) requires a non - standard higgs sector @xcite which introduces additional sources of cp - violation@xcite beyond the @xmath3 phase @xcite .",
    "the plethora of cp - phases also influences the decays and mixings of b mesons ( as well as d and k mesons ) .",
    "the present experiments at babar , tevatron and kek and the one to start at the lhc will be able to measure various decay channels to determine if there are supersymmetric sources of cp violation . in particular , cp - asymmetry and decay rate of @xmath4 form a good testing ground for low - energy supersymmetry with cp violation @xcite .",
    "the above - mentioned additional cp - phases explain the cosmological baryon asymmetry of the universe and the lightest susy particle could be an excellent candidate for cold dark matter in the universe @xcite .    in the case of exact supersymmetry",
    ", all scalar particles would have to have same masses with their associated sm partners .",
    "since none of the superpartners has been discovered , supersymmetry must be broken .",
    "but in order to preserve the hierarchy problem solved the supersymmetry must be broken softly .",
    "this leads to a reasonable mass splittings between known particles and their superpartners , i.e. to the superpartners masses around 1 tev .    the precision experiments by wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite have put the following constraint on the relic density of cold dark matter which are based on 1st year data .",
    "now the wmap 3rd year data is also available @xcite , but the new wmap + sdss combined value for relic density of dark matter does not change the numerical results in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely the wmap - allowed bands .",
    "see `` note added '' section of ref . @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath5    recently , in the light of this cosmological constraint an extensive analysis of the neutralino relic density in the presence of susy - cp phases has been given by blanger _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "analyses of the decays of third generation scalar quarks @xcite and scalar leptons @xcite with complex susy parameters have been performed by bartl et al . in this study",
    "we present the numerical investigation of the fermionic two - body decays of third family sleptons in mssm with complex susy parameters taking into account the cosmological bound imposed by wmap data .",
    "actually , we had performed some studies in this direction for squarks @xcite incorporating all the existing bounds on the susy parameter space by utilizing the study by belanger et al .",
    "@xcite before .",
    "these investigations showed us that the effects of @xmath6 and its phase @xmath7 on the decay widths of squarks are quite significant .",
    "now we consider third generation sleptons .",
    "namely , we study the effect of @xmath6 and its phase @xmath8 on the decay widths of @xmath0 and @xmath9 .    in the numerical calculations ,",
    "although the susy parameters @xmath10 , @xmath6 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are in general complex , we assume that @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are real , but @xmath6 and its phase @xmath13 take values on the wmap- allowed bands given in ref .",
    "these bands also satisfy the edm bounds @xcite .",
    "the experimental upper limits on the edms of electron , neutron and the @xmath14 and the @xmath15 atoms may impose constraints on the size of the susy cp - phases @xcite . however , these constraints are highly model dependent .",
    "this means that it is possible to suppress the edms without requiring the various susy cp - phases be small .",
    "for example , in the mssm assuming strong cancellations between different contributions @xcite , the phase of @xmath10 is restricted to @xmath16 , but there is no such restriction on the phases of @xmath6 and @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , we evaluate the parameter @xmath11 via the relation @xmath17 which can be derived by assuming gaugino mass unification purely in the electroweak sector of mssm .",
    "it is very important to insert the wmap - allowed band in the plane @xmath18 into the numerical calculations instead of taking one fixed @xmath6 value for all @xmath19-phases , because , for example , on the allowed band for @xmath20 gev , @xmath6 starts from 140 gev for @xmath21 and increasing monotonically it becomes 165 gev for @xmath22 . in ref.@xcite two wmap - allowed band plots",
    "are given , one for @xmath20 gev and the other for @xmath23 gev .",
    "for both plots the other parameters are fixed to be @xmath24 , @xmath25 tev , @xmath26 tev and @xmath27=@xmath28=0 .",
    "we here choose the masses for @xmath0 sleptons as @xmath29=1000 gev and @xmath30=750 gev .",
    "these @xmath31 values lead to a sneutrino mass @xmath32=745 gev for @xmath33 .",
    "the superpartners of the sm fermions with left and right helicity are the left and right sfermions . in the case of tau slepton ( stau )",
    "the left and right states are in general mixed .",

    "in particular , recent results from fermi lat @xcite indicate an excess of the electron plus positron flux at energies above 100 gev .",
    "this also confirms the earlier results from atic @xcite . on the other hand , pamela experiment @xcite reports a prominent upturn in the positron fraction from 10 - 100 gev , in contrast to what is expected from high - energy cosmic rays interacting with the interstellar medium .",
    "although standard astrophysical sources such as pulsars and microquasars may be able to account for these anomalies , the positron excess at pamela and the electron plus positron flux of fermi lat have caused a lot of excitement being interpreted as decay / annihilation of dark matter .",
    "these unexpected results from pamela , atic and fermi lat experiments imply a new constrain on lsp that is cdm candidate : lsp must have not only the correct relic density found by wmap but also correct decay / annihilation rates into electron - positron pairs . in the framework of the mssm , a detailed analysis of decay of cdm that includes the observed cosmic ray anomalies has been given in ref .",
