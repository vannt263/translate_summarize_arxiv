    "recently , impressive experimental results concerning the quantum degenerate regime of a dilute gas of trapped fermionic atoms have been presented  @xcite . by cooling @xmath0 @xmath1k atoms to @xmath2 of the fermi temperature , the onset of fermi degeneracy was observed in the thermodynamic and in the scattering properties of the gas .",
    "also , progress towards achieving fermi degeneracy for trapped @xmath3li @xcite has been presented .",
    "such a weakly - interacting , degenerate fermi - dirac gas provides a new platform for exploring fundamental quantum many - body physics .",
    "several theoretical results dealing with the equilibrium properties of such a gas have been presented  @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been shown that a two - component gas of spin - polarized @xmath3li undergoes a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) transition to superfluidity at experimentally obtainable densities and temperatures  @xcite .",
    "one class of experiments that is compatible with trapping protocols , and which has gleaned valuable information on the dynamics of dilute bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , involves monitoring the response of the gas to a change in trapping potential .",
    "for example , transient modulation of the trapping potential induces free ringing of the gas , which in the case of becs led to a direct determination of low - lying regions of the quasi - particle spectrum @xcite .",
    "complete release of the trapping potential enables one to view the free expansion of the gas ; this established early on the essential validity of the time - dependent gross - pitaevski equation for describing the dynamics of latest generation of becs @xcite , which was later put to stringent quantitative tests  @xcite .",
    "a trapped , single - component gas of ultracold fermionic atoms can , for experiments of current interest , be considered to be ideal ( noninteracting ) as a reasonable approximation , since atomic collisions are strongly suppressed  @xcite . in this paper , we examine theoretically the dynamics of such an ideal gas in a time - dependent trap . using a scaling formalism similar to that which has been successfully applied to trapped becs  @xcite , we derive analytical results for the class of experiments mentioned above .",
    "the essential fermionic character of the systems with which we are concerned is established by the initial distribution of particles in the trap ; the time evolution of this distribution , under changes of the trapping potential that preserve its harmonicity , are rigorously equivalent to that of an ensemble of noninteracting particles , independent of statistics .",
    "we present a simple formula that describes the free expansion of such an ideal gas , and our results suggest a new approach to the problem of quantitative thermometry in the nanokelvin regime .",
    "due to their weak pair interactions , single - component fermi - dirac gases are attractive candidates for nanokelvin thermometry ; with an improved theoretical understanding of finite - temperature properties of becs  @xcite , which are much more robust candidates for experiment at present , we can envisage a direct comparison of temperatures of ultracold bose - einstein and fermi - dirac gases .",
    "we also examine in detail the ( non - linear ) response of the gas to a harmonic oscillation of the trapping frequency .",
    "this reveals a domain of driving frequencies and amplitudes which generates a resonant response of the gas .",
    "the non - interacting limit considered here should provide a good approximation for degenerate , single - component cold fermi - dirac gases . since interactions in general play a smaller role for fermi - dirac vs. bose - einstein systems , the present approach may also provide a useful starting point for consideration of the dynamics of multiple - component fermi gases .",
    "we start with a derivation of the equations describing the scaling properties of an ideal gas trapped in a time - dependent harmonic potential . consider a classical particle of mass @xmath4 trapped in a potential @xmath5 with @xmath6 denoting the 3 spatial dimensions .",
    "we set @xmath7 for @xmath8 , i.e. the trap potential is constant prior to @xmath9 .",
    "newton s law is then expressed by @xmath10 and @xmath11 . invoking a scaling transformation @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    ", we obtain @xmath14 , with @xmath15 , if the scaling parameters @xmath16 satisfy the equations @xmath17 in quantum mechanics , the heisenberg equation for a non - interacting gas in a time - dependent harmonic potential takes the form : @xmath18\\hat{\\psi}({\\mathbf{r}},t).\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the field operator for an atom in a single hyperfine state at position @xmath20 , which obeys the usual fermi - dirac anticommutation relations .",
    "the quantum mechanical analogue of the rescaling outlined for the classical case above corresponds to writing  @xcite @xmath21}{\\sqrt{\\gamma_x\\gamma_y\\gamma_z } }   e^{im\\sum_jr_j^2\\dot{\\gamma}_j/2\\hbar\\gamma_j}\\ ] ] with @xmath22 , as defined above . if each @xmath23 satisfies eq.([gammaeq ] ) , by writing @xmath24=\\pi_j\\hat{\\phi}[q_j(t)]$ ] , we obtain @xmath25=[-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\partial^2_{q_j } + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_{0j}^2q_j^2]\\hat{\\phi}[q_j(t)].\\ ] ] thus , the time - dependent problem has been reduced to the trivial case of evolution in a time - independent harmonic trap in the rescaled variables @xmath26 .",
    "determination of these variables requires only the solution of the three ordinary differential equations expressed by eq.([gammaeq ] ) ; the three spatial dimensions can be treated independently .",
    "an appealing qualitative description of the solution of these equations , cast in the context of one - dimensional scattering theory , has been given by kagan et al.@xcite . from eq.([transform ] ) , it follows that the density @xmath27 of the gas for a given time @xmath28 is given by @xmath29\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the particle density for @xmath31 .",
    "thus , we can calculate @xmath27 for any time @xmath32 for modulated frequencies @xmath33 , by solving eq.([gammaeq ] ) , subject to the boundary conditions @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "equation ( [ gammaeq ] ) also describes the two - dimensional , non - ideal bec subject to isotropic variations of the trap potential , with eq.([density ] ) also being applicable if @xmath36 is obtained by a solution of the gross - pitaevski equation  @xcite .",
    "we now analyze the solution of eq.([gammaeq ] ) for two cases of experimental relevance : free expansion ; and harmonic modulation of the trapping potential .",
    "to model a free expansion experiment , we take @xmath37 for @xmath32 . solving eq.([gammaeq ] ) with the requirement that the gas is in equilibrium for @xmath38",
    ", we obtain @xmath39 for @xmath38 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "the time - dependent width of the cloud after the trap has been dropped is given by @xmath42 .",
    "to describe the aspect ratio @xmath43 of a cylindrically - symmetric cloud , we find @xmath44 we now apply these results to an ideal gas in two limiting cases .",
    "we first treat the case of @xmath45 , with the chemical potential @xmath46 for @xmath6 .",
    "this corresponds to the semiclassical limit , appropriate to current experiments with more than a few hundred trapped atoms . in this limit",
    ", the initial density profile is well described by the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation  @xcite .",
    "this gives the integrated density @xmath47 , @xmath48 ^ 2\\ ] ] with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we see that the cloud becomes isotropic for @xmath51 .",
    "this is the result one would get for a classical gas at finite temperature , in which the momentum distribution is isotropic , and is consistent with the initial isotropic momentum distribution implicit in the tf approximation ( in becs in anisotropic traps , on the other hand , the long - time expansion is anisotropic due to macroscopic population of an anisotropic initial state , a key result in their first observation  @xcite ) .",
    "the initial aspect ratio of @xmath52 and eq.([alpha ] ) evolves to @xmath53 as @xmath54 . in fig.([expandfig ] ) , we plot the integrated density @xmath55 for @xmath45 , @xmath56 , and @xmath31 ( a ) and @xmath57 ( b ) .",
    "we have taken @xmath58 and @xmath59 corresponding to current experiments on trapped @xmath1k atoms  @xcite .",
    "the two snapshots of the integrated density clearly show that the gas becomes isotropic for large expansion times .",
    "this is further illustrated in fig.([alphafig ] ) , where we plot @xmath43 as given in eq.([alpha ] ) for the same set of parameters .",
    "note that @xmath52 for any initial density distribution of the form @xmath60 .",
    "such initial distributions will become isotropic in an free expansion experiment .",
    "for instance , for @xmath61 , the density is well described by a classical gaussian profile , i.e.   @xmath62 $ ] and fig.([alphafig ] ) thus describes a trapped gas of fermions for any @xmath63 within the tf approximation .",
    "this means that one can not detect the onset of fermi degeneracy by looking at the aspect ratio of the expanding gas .    as an example where",
    "@xmath64 , we now consider a case with @xmath65 such that only one level is occupied in the @xmath66-direction and @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "the gas is initially strongly confined in the @xmath66-direction .",
    "the integrated density profile is then @xmath69 for @xmath70 , yielding @xmath71 . in fig.([alphafig ] ) , we plot the aspect ratio for a free expansion for @xmath72 and @xmath73 using eq.([alpha ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath74 and @xmath75 for @xmath54 .",
    "the gas , which initially is strongly confined in the @xmath66-direction will for @xmath51 become most confined in the @xmath76- , and @xmath77-directions .",
    "this is , of course , a direct reflection of the uncertainty relation giving higher average momentum in the @xmath66-direction .",
    "however , observation of such a quantum effect requires a highly anisotropic trap . for the case of @xmath78",
    "trapped atoms we would require @xmath79 . thus , for fermi - dirac particles the anisotropy of the expanded cloud due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle is considerably less than that encountered in the bose - einstein case .    from a measurement of the density at any time @xmath28 under free expansion",
    "it is straightforward to determine the initial density distribution @xmath30 using eq.([density])-([gammafree ] ) .",
    "this suggests that a trapped , single - component fermi - dirac gas could serve as a low @xmath63 thermometer . assuming the gas is in thermodynamic equilibrium for @xmath80",
    ", one could infer the temperature of the gas from a knowledge of its density distribution , the calculation of which is a trivial problem of summing over fractionally occupied trap levels .",
    "hence , a determination of @xmath63 is simply a matter of fitting a calculated density to the measured @xmath81 .",
    "density profiles for an ideal fermi - dirac gas for various temperatures have already been given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "however , if only one hyperfine level is present at all times , the atomic collisions required for thermalization are suppressed at low temperatures , and evaporative cooling of the gas will be inhibited .",
    "this can be remedied by initially trapping the gas in two hyperfine states , to allow @xmath82-wave collisions between atoms in different states .",
    "one can then deplete the trap of one hyperfine state by applying a microwave field that depletes one of the states .",
    "if this depletion occurs on a time scale that is long compared to collision times in the sample , the remaining atoms will be in thermodynamic equilibrium , and their expansion can be described by the results in this section .",
    "in fact , a procedure of this type is being used in present experiments on trapped @xmath1k atoms  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one could drop the trap with both hyperfine levels present . the initial density profile and the free expansion of the gas",
    "will then be perturbed away from the ideal gas result by the interactions .",
    "when the effect of interactions is small , the initial equilibrium density and the subsequent expansion can be calculated relatively easily .",
    "a calculation of the effect of the interactions on the equilibrium distribution has been presented elsewhere ,  @xcite and the effect of the interactions on the free expansion can be calculated within the mean - field approximation , starting from the simple uncoupled solutions given by eq.([gammafree ] ) for each spatial direction  @xcite .",
    "as noted above , modulation of the trapping frequency has proven to be a useful technique for probing the low - lying collective modes of trapped becs .",
    "we therefore examine theoretically the non - linear response of a trapped gas to such a modulation .",
    "the non - interacting case treated here is in some sense opposite to the hydrodynamic limit we have treated elsewhere  @xcite . to model a typical experiment",
    ", we assume that the trapping frequencies take the form @xmath83 $ ] for @xmath32 with @xmath84 being the driving frequency and @xmath85 the driving amplitude . instead of solving eq.([gammaeq ] ) with this form for @xmath33 ,",
    "it turns out to be easier to go back to the original classical equation of motion @xmath86 by using @xmath87 and @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "thus , by writing @xmath89 $ ] , and @xmath90 , we obtain : @xmath91\\xi_j=0\\ ] ] with @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "equation ( [ mathieu ] ) is a variant of mathieu s equation  @xcite , whose properties have been extensively studied .",
    "its behavior is easy to explain in one case of experimental interest : that when the trap frequency is modulated during a finite interval @xmath95 , and then returned to its original value",
    ". the subsequent motion of the cloud is described by a solution of the time - independent problem @xmath96 with arbitrary initial conditions : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a conserved quantity for @xmath99 ; @xmath100 $ ] ; and @xmath101 is the value of @xmath16 immediately after the modulation ceases .",
    "equation ( [ gammagen ] ) has a discrete frequency spectrum ( frequencies of @xmath102 with @xmath103 ) , as expected for a non - interacting gas in a harmonic trap .",
    "the linear response limit is recovered by letting @xmath104 ineq.([gammagen ] ) , to obtain @xmath105 .",
    "in essence , the problem of predicting the response of the gas to a harmonic driving with frequency @xmath84 and amplitude @xmath85 is reduced to an analysis of the well - known solutions to mathieu s equation . in the parameter space @xmath106",
    ", there are regions where the solutions of eq.([mathieu ] ) are unstable , i.e.  their amplitude increases exponentially with time . also , there are stable regions where the solutions remain bounded .",
    "the solutions on the boundaries between these regions are the mathieu functions  @xcite . using @xmath107 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 ,",
    "this means that for certain regions in the @xmath108-space , the response of the gas diverges as the driving time @xmath109 increases , i.e. there is a resonant response , whereas in other regions the response of the gas remains finite for any value of @xmath109 .",
    "specifically , for @xmath110 with @xmath103 , the solutions to eq.([mathieu ] ) diverge in time for an arbitrary small @xmath111  @xcite .",
    "thus , for @xmath112 the response of the gas is resonant for an arbitrarely small driving amplitude and the amplitude of its oscillations will diverge with the driving time . in terms of eq.([gammagen ] ) , if the gas remains trapped in the time - independent potential @xmath96 after the driving ( @xmath99 ) , we have @xmath113 and the oscillations of the gas will be large and contain many harmonics .",
    "the resonance for @xmath114 is , of course , the usual excitation frequency for an even - parity perturbation for a non - interacting gas .",
    "however , the resonances for @xmath115 etc .  do not correspond to new modes .",
    "they simply reflect the fact that for these driving frequencies , the trapping potential is doing resonant work on the gas .",
    "note that the present scaling formalism does not predict the higher - frequency modes at @xmath116 with @xmath117 , as they do not correspond to simple dilations / contractions of the cloud .",
    "we will now examine the width of the unstable ( resonant ) regions around @xmath118 for @xmath119 .",
    "for the @xmath114 resonance , the unstable region of the mathieu equation is bounded by @xmath120 for @xmath121  @xcite .",
    "this gives , that for driving frequencies and amplitudes such that @xmath122 the response of the gas is divergent .",
    "hence , the resonance region of the gas for finite but small driving amplitude @xmath85 has a reasonable width and should be relatively easy to access experimentally . likewise , for the @xmath123 resonance , the unstable region is bounded by @xmath124 and it should be experimentally accessible . for the lower frequency resonances ( @xmath125 ) , it turns out that the resonance regions are very narrow for @xmath119 as the boundary lines between the stable and unstable solutions of eq.([mathieu ] ) only differ by terms of order @xmath126 or higher  @xcite .",
    "thus , these resonances are difficult to find experimentally for @xmath119 .",
    "instead , one could increase the driving amplitude @xmath85 for a given frequency @xmath84 ; for large enough @xmath85 , an unstable region is reached and the response of the gas diverges .",
    "the above results are illustrated in fig.([mathieufig ] ) , where we plot the response of the gas as a function of driving frequency @xmath84 and amplitude @xmath85 .",
    "the lines in the plot separate regions where the response of the gas remains finite from regions where the oscillations of the gas diverge with driving time .",
    "for example , if one modulates the external potential with an off - resonance frequency of @xmath127 , the response of the gas remains finite for small @xmath85 . however , if one gradually increases the driving amplitude @xmath85 for this frequency , then one should observe a divergent response of the gas for @xmath85 larger than @xmath128 . the plot is generated using the well - known properties of the mathieu equation and the mapping @xmath129 .",
    "note the unstable ( resonance ) regions for @xmath119 for @xmath118 .",
    "the regions have zero width for @xmath119 for @xmath130 as predicted above . for increasing driving amplitude @xmath85 ,",
    "the unstable regions grow as expected . for @xmath131 ,",
    "the response of the gas for @xmath132 is finite whereas it diverges for @xmath133 .",
    "physically , this corresponds to the fact that for @xmath134 and @xmath135 , the gas returns adiabatically to its initial state after one period of trap modulation and there is no net work done .",
    "contrary , for @xmath136 the trapping potential becomes inverted for certain times resulting in a divergent response of the gas .",
    "mathematically , the transition region for @xmath137 comes from the fact , that for @xmath138 , the even and odd periodic solutions ( mathieu functions ) of eq.([mathieu ] ) start to differ in `` energy '' ( the mathieu characteristic value @xmath139  @xcite ) , as the tunneling between successive minima of the potential potential @xmath140 becomes significant .    again , since a spin - polarized gas of cold fermionic atoms is effectively ideal , the results presented here should apply to the response of such a gas to a harmonic modulation of the trapping potential .",
    "in conclusion , using a scaling formalism we have been able to derive simple analytical results for the dynamics of ideal gases trapped in time - dependent harmonic traps .",
    "we have concentrated on two important classes of experiments : for free expansion , we show how the initial density profile of the gas can easily be determined from a measurement of the density profile at any time @xmath28 after the trap has been dropped .",
    "we proposed a low @xmath63 thermometer based on these results . also , we showed how the problem of determining non - linear response of the gas to a harmonic modulation of the trapping frequency can be mapped to an analysis of the well - known properties of the solutions to mathieu s equation .",
    "we identified regions in @xmath108-space where the response of the gas was divergent with the modulation time .",
    "especially , we were able to predict unstable regions for @xmath119 reflecting the fact , that the trap is doing resonant work on the gas .",
    "since ultracold spin - polarized fermions are non - interacting to a very good approximation , our results should be directly relevant for current experiments in this very active field of research .",
