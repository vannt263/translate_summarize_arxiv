    "[ chap : intro ] graphene , a one - atom - thick allotrope of carbon @xcite , has attracted much attention of theoretical physicists , since its electronic excitations are described by two - dimensional ( 2d ) _ massless dirac fermion _ ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath4 be the fermi velocity .",
    "then , for a free fermion , the 2d massless dirac equation is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is a two - component wave function with the particle position @xmath10 .",
    "for a wave - number vector @xmath11 , the eigenvalues of energy are given by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where the @xmath14 signs correspond to two values of the helicity of fermion .",
    "the wave functions are determined as @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the volume of the system and @xmath17    although the basic description of the system is very simple as shown above , physics of graphene is extremely rich , since the 2d dirac equation is much modified by external electric and magnetic fields applied to the graphene plane as well as by changing geometric and topological features of the 2d surface @xcite . as a matter of fact , an ultrathin membrane is unstable in the 3d real space and in suspended graphene and in graphene placed on a substrate nanometer - scale corrugations , which are simply called _ ripples _",
    "@xcite , are observed @xcite . since spatial distribution of such microscopic structures on the surface can not be controlled , even when we apply uniform electric and/or magnetic fields , the rippled graphene will behave as a 2d system with randomly distributed scalar and vector potentials on it .",
    "effect of ripples on electronic transport on graphene is an interesting subject both from theory and experiment @xcite .",
    "recently , magnetotransport measurements on rippled graphene have been reported , where a magnetic field is applied parallel to the averaged 2d plane of the graphene @xcite ( see also @xcite for bilayer graphene ) .",
    "if the surface is a perfect plane , such an in - plane magnetic field @xmath18 does not affect any motion of 2d electron , since electronic motion couples only to the component of magnetic field normal to the 2d plane .",
    "but on real graphene , the magnetic field becomes to include a component normal to the surface depending on the local slope around ripples .",
    "then the system has inhomogeneous out - of - plane magnetic fields .",
    "with respect to electromagnetic property , we will be able to regard the rippled graphene with @xmath18 as a system of traveling 2d massless dirac fermions , which are randomly scattered by ripples @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , we study a formula of lundeberg and folk for the magnetoresistance @xmath19 , which was derived from a model based on the boltzmann transport theory @xcite .",
    "the relative height of ripple on the averaged 2d plane is denoted by @xmath20 for each 2d position @xmath10 .",
    "we characterize the height distribution by the _ two - point height correlation _ @xmath21 which is defined as a statistical average of product of the height at @xmath22 and that at the position separated from @xmath22 by a displacement vector @xmath23 . for simplicity , we assume that the distribution of @xmath20 is translation invariant and isotropic in this paper . by this assumption , ( [ eqn : corr1 ] )",

    ", we define @xmath26 where @xmath27 with the bessel function @xmath28 ( see appendix a for special functions @xcite ) .",
    "the _ signed carrier - density _ of graphene is denoted by @xmath29 , which is the difference of the density of electrons @xmath30 and that of holes @xmath31 .",
    "we assume that the temperature is low and the state is degenerated so that the wave - number of fermion @xmath32 is well - approximated by the fermi wave - number @xmath33 . with counting contributions from the two dirac points @xmath34 and @xmath35 and spin ,",

    "let @xmath40 and @xmath41 be the angle between @xmath18 and the direction of the current @xmath42 along which the resistance @xmath43 is measured . set @xmath44 , the @xmath18-induced part of resistance , which we call _",
    "magnetoresistance_. then the _ lundeberg - folk formula _ is given as @xmath45 remark that this formula is not given in the published paper @xcite of lundeberg and folk , but the corresponding equations are found in appendix of its arxiv version @xcite .",
    "lundeberg and folk introduced a correlation length @xmath46 for ripple - height correlation @xmath1 and argued the asymptotic behavior of @xmath47 in @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and from the latter estimate the behavior of ( [ eqn : lf1 ] ) in high carrier - density region was predicted as @xmath50 .",
    "this @xmath51-law was emphasized in their paper and has been used for analyzing experimental data @xcite , while it is an asymptotic law in @xmath52 for a special case with the gaussian height - correlation of ripples as clarified below in the present paper .",
    "here we call the general equation ( [ eqn : lf1 ] ) the lundeberg - folk formula .    the main purpose of the present paper is to show that , for the two cases @xmath53 with a variance of height @xmath54 , exact and explicit representations for the anisotropic magnetoresistance ( [ eqn : lf1 ] ) are obtained .",

    ", there is a logarithmic correction to the @xmath51-law in the case ( i ) with the exponential height - correlation of ripples .    for the low carrier - density region ,",
    "we have found the following behavior for the magnetoresistance ; when @xmath63 , @xmath64 that is , @xmath65 shows a cusp at the charge neutrality point @xmath66 and the dependence on @xmath37 around this point is linear @xmath67 .    in the present paper",
    "we apply our analytic results to the experimental data in the whole region of @xmath37 .",
    "the result seems to be excellent if we assume the gaussian height - correlation of ripples .",
    "see figures [ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig3 ] in section [ chap : remark ] . in the vicinity of charge neutrality point",
