    "measurements of hadronic states with charm quarks such as the @xmath3 have led to extensive and still ongoing discussions about our deeper understanding of mesons and baryons  @xcite , traditionally thought to be composed of a pair of quark and antiquark or three quarks in the naive quark model . with its mass ( @xmath4 mev )",
    "about 100 mev lower than the lowest @xmath5 scalar state in the naive quark model , the @xmath1 can not be a conventional @xmath6 state  @xcite .",
    "one possible interpretation is that of a compound dynamically generated by the strong @xmath2 interaction in coupled - channels dynamics  @xcite .",
    "such approaches have provided many useful insights into the nature of some most intriguing new resonances ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for some recent applications ) .    in order to clarify the nature of the @xmath3 , or of any other meson of similar kind ,",
    "it is useful to study such objects from various perspectives and compare the results with experimental and lattice qcd ( lqcd ) data . in this respect",
    ", it has been argued that the isospin - breaking decay width @xmath7  @xcite , the light - quark mass dependence  @xcite , and the volume dependence  @xcite of the @xmath3 properties can provide valuable information on its nature . at the same time",
    "it should also be noted that , in addition to the @xmath3 , coupled - channels unitary dynamics predicts several other states in sectors or channels related to the @xmath3 by heavy - quark spin and flavor symmetry and ( approximate ) chiral symmetry [ or broken su(4 ) symmetry ]  @xcite .",
    "once the mass and width of the @xmath3 are fixed , so are those of the other related states . future experiments in search for those resonances in the predicted energy regions are therefore strongly encouraged .",
    "all these predictions are subject to potentially sizable symmetry - breaking corrections . in particular , a comprehensive study of recoil corrections is necessary because the velocity of the charm quark in @xmath8 mesons is only about @xmath9 , not small enough to allow for a complete neglect of recoil corrections . for the scattering lengths of the nambu - goldstone bosons off the @xmath0 mesons , such a study has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it was shown that indeed recoil corrections are sizable . in refs .",
    "@xcite , covariant chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , supplemented with the extended - on - mass - shell ( eoms ) scheme , was applied to study the decay constants of the @xmath8/@xmath10 mesons .",
    "it was shown that the covariant chpt converges faster than its nonrelativistic ( heavy - meson ) counterpart .",
    "these findings can , to some extent , be deemed as repercussions of the one - baryon sector .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that the eoms formulation of the baryon chpt is capable of better describing three - flavor observables and their light - quark mass evolutions than its nonrelativistic ( heavy - baryon ) counterpart , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references cited therein .    in the present work we study the interactions of the heavy - light mesons ( @xmath0 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and their strange counterparts ) with nambu - goldstone bosons ( the octet of the lightest pseudoscalar mesons ) in covariant chpt and its unitary version .",
    "we calculate the interaction potentials up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and perform an iteration of these potentials to all orders using the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "it was pointed out that in the covariant calculation of the loop function appearing in the bethe - salpeter equation , one loses the heavy - quark spin and flavor symmetry  @xcite .",
    "we study this problem in detail and propose a new renormalization scheme , similar in spirit to the eoms scheme widely used in the one - baryon sector  @xcite and also used in refs .",
    "@xcite , to recover heavy - quark spin and flavor symmetry up to @xmath14 corrections , where @xmath15 is a generic heavy - light meson mass .",
    "we apply our approach to describe the most recent fully dynamical lqcd simulations for the scattering lengths of nambu - goldstone bosons off the @xmath0 mesons  @xcite and fix the relevant low - energy and subtraction constants .  , @xmath16 , and @xmath2 scattering lengths",
    "have also been calculated on the lattice using both quark - antiquark and meson - meson interpolating fields  @xcite and the @xmath1 is found to be a bound state in the @xmath2 channel  @xcite .",
    "] we then solve the corresponding bethe - salpeter equations and search for poles in the complex energy plane , identified as dynamically generated states .",
    "we show that a number of @xmath17 and @xmath18 states emerge naturally , including the @xmath1 , the @xmath19 and their bottom - quark counterparts .",

    "@xcite studied the preliminary lqcd results of ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the relevant terms of the effective chiral lagrangian are summarized and the driving potentials up to nlo are constructed . in sec .",
    "iii we propose a new renormalization scheme to be used in the bethe - salpeter equation , which manifestly satisfies the chiral power counting rules and heavy - quark spin and flavor symmetries .",
    "we discuss the advantage of this scheme in comparison with others widely used in unitary chpt . in sec .",
    "iv , we apply both the unitary heavy - meson and covariant formulations of chpt to fit the lqcd data and make predictions for the existence of a number of dynamically generated resonances in both the charm and the bottom sectors . a short summary is given in sec .",
    "introducing the chiral effective lagrangians in the present context , one first has to specify a power counting rule . in the present work ,",
    "the nambu - goldstone boson ( ngb ) masses @xmath20 and the field gradients @xmath21 are counted as @xmath22 as usual , where @xmath23 denotes a ngb boson of the pseudoscalar octet . for @xmath0 mesons , the triplets are @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and for @xmath26 mesons , they are @xmath27 and @xmath28 . their field gradients @xmath29 and @xmath30 and masses @xmath31 and @xmath32 are counted as @xmath33 . the ngb propagator @xmath34 is counted as @xmath35 , while the heavy - light pseudoscalar and vector meson propagators @xmath36 and @xmath37 are counted as @xmath38 .",
    "the chiral order of the propagators of the heavy - light mesons can be understood as follows . as in standard heavy - meson ( hm ) chpt ,",
    "one can write the momentum @xmath39 as a sum of a large component and a residual small component , i.e. , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the velocity of the heavy - light meson and @xmath42 is the small residual component counted as @xmath43",
    ". therefore , the heavy - light pseudoscalar meson propagator becomes @xmath44 , which is counted as @xmath38 .",
    "the same is true for the heavy - light vector meson propagator .",
    "the leading order covariant chiral lagrangian describing the interactions of the ngbs with the heavy - light pseudoscalar and vector mesons has the following form : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath32 are the @xmath47 and @xmath48 masses in the chiral limit , respectively , and @xmath49 denotes trace in the @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 flavor space .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath53 has mass dimension @xmath54 , whereas @xmath55 is dimensionless .",
    "the axial current is defined as @xmath56 and the chiral covariant derivative is @xmath57 with the vector current @xmath58 . in these equations , @xmath59 with @xmath60 being the ngb decay constant in the chiral limit and @xmath61 collecting the octet of ngb fields : @xmath62    the coupling @xmath63 is known empirically .",
    "it can be determined from the decay width @xmath64 together with the branching ratio @xmath65  @xcite . at tree level , @xmath66 , which gives @xmath67 .",
    "the coupling @xmath68 can be related to @xmath69 through the heavy - quark spin symmetry , i.e. , @xmath70 , keeping in mind that there could be sizable deviations of higher order in @xmath71 . the couplings @xmath72 and @xmath73 can be related to their @xmath0 counterparts through heavy - quark flavor symmetry .    in a similar way , one can construct the covariant nlo terms of the effective lagrangian : @xmath74\\mathcal d_\\nu p^\\dagger\\rangle]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + 2[\\tilde c_0\\langle p^*_\\mu",
