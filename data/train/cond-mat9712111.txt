    "the duality relation for the potts model @xcite is an identity @xcite relating the partition functions of a potts model on a planar lattice with that of its dual .",
    "very recently , one of us @xcite has extended the duality consideration to potts correlation functions .",
    "specifically , it was established that certain duality relations exist for correlation functions of any @xmath0 potts spins sitting on the boundary of a planar graph .",
    "explicit expressions for the duality relation were then obtained for @xmath2 . while for @xmath3 the relation generalizes a known expression @xcite for the 2-point correlation function of the ising model , the general @xmath0 results are new .",
    "it was also stated in @xcite that the formulation can be extended in a straightforward fashion to @xmath4 , and to the more general ( @xmath5 ) model of domany and riedel @xcite .",
    "jacobsen @xcite has since pointed out that the procedure as described in @xcite does not extend straightforwardly to @xmath4 . but",
    "wu and huang @xcite subsequently showed that the procedure can be made to work , provided that one invokes certain correlation identities which have not previously been known . in this paper",
    "we address the other extension of the formulation mention in @xcite , namely , the extension to the ( @xmath5 ) model . here",
    ", we report results for @xmath2 .",
    "the ( @xmath5 ) model @xcite is an @xmath6-state spin model , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are positive integers . for brevity we shall rename @xmath9",
    "the model is most conveniently visualized as being represented by placing two potts spins at each site . at each site of a lattice , or more generally a graph , @xmath10 of @xmath11 sites ,",
    "one places two potts spins of @xmath12 and @xmath13 states , respectively .",
    "denote the spins states by @xmath14 and @xmath15 . then , the interaction energy @xmath16 between two sites in spin states @xmath17 and @xmath18 is given by -e ( , ;  ,  ) /kt",

    "the @xmath1 model becomes the ashkin - teller model @xcite when @xmath22 .",
    "the partition function of the @xmath1 model is given by z= _",

    "let @xmath28 be the partition function of an ( @xmath29 ) model on the dual of @xmath10 which has @xmath30 sites with interactions also given by ( [ inter ] ) , but with @xmath31 replaced by @xmath32 .",
    "further introduce boltzmann factors @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "then , it is well - known @xcite that the duality relation assumes the form z(u_00,u_01,u_10,u_11 ) = ( qqc ) z^*(u_00^*,u_01^*,u_10^*,u_11^ * ) , [ dual ] where @xmath35 and u_00^ * & = & u_00 + ( q-1)u_10 + ( q-1)u_01+(q-1)(q-1)u_11 + u_01^ * & = & u_00 -u_01 + ( q-1)(u_10-u_11 ) + u_10^ * & = & u_00 -u_10 + ( q-1)(u_01-u_11 ) + u_11^ * & = & u_00 -u_01 -u_10+u_11 . [ dualinter ] note that the transformation ( [ dualinter ] ) can be written more compactly as ^ * = * t*_2(q ) ( q ) , where = , .5 cm * u*^ * = , .5 cm * t*_2(q ) = .",

    ". we shall refer to ( [ dual ] ) as the fundamental duality relation which applies to arbitrary graph @xmath10 with arbitrary ( nonuniform ) edge interactions . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the duality relations for correlation functions are most conveniently obtained by applications of this fundamental duality relation .",
    "in this section we consider the duality for the 2-point correlation functions between any two spins at sites @xmath38 and @xmath39 on the boundary of @xmath10 .",
    "following @xcite , this is done by applying ( [ dual ] ) to an auxiliary graph ( lattice ) .",
    "the auxiliary graph is obtained from @xmath10 by connecting sites @xmath38 and @xmath39 with an auxiliary edge as shown in fig .",
    "let @xmath40 and @xmath41 be the respective boltzmann factors associated with this edge and its dual related by ( [ dualinter ] ) . applying the fundamental duality to the auxiliary graph of fig .",
    "1(a ) , we arrive at ( [ dual ] ) in the form z_aux = c z^*_aux , where we have used the fact that the dual of the auxiliary graph has @xmath42 sites , and z_aux & = & qq[u_00z_00;00+(q-1)u_10z_01;00 + ( q-1)u_01z_00;01+(q-1)(q-1)u_11z_01;01 ] + z^*_aux & = & qq[u^*_00z^*_00;00+(q-1)u^*_10z^*_01;00 + ( q-1)u^*_01z^*_00;01+(q-1)(q-1)u^*_11z^*_01;01 ] .",
    "[ auxil ] note that in writing down ( [ auxil ] ) we have made use of the degeneracy @xmath43 ; @xmath44 ; etc .    substituting ( [ dualinter ] ) into ( [ auxil ] ) , the dual relation ( [ dual ] ) becomes linear in both @xmath40 and @xmath45 .",
    "it is now a simple matter to equate the coefficients of the 4 @xmath40 , and obtain z_00;00&=&c[z^*_00;00+(q-1)z^*_01;00+(q-1)(z^*_00;01+(q-1)z^*_01;01 ) ] + z_01;00&=&c[z^*_00;00-z^*_01;00+(q-1)(z^*_00;01-z^*_01;01 ) ] + z_00;01&=&c[z^*_00;00-z^*_00;01+(q-1)(z^*_01;00 -z^*_01;01 ) ] + z_01;01&=&c[z^*_00;00-z^*_01;00-z^*_00;01+z^*_01;01 ] .",
    "[ a ] this relation can be written more compactly as _ 2 = c*t*_2(q)_2^ * ( q ) , [ z ] where @xmath46 is a @xmath47 matrix with @xmath48-th element @xmath49 , and similarly for @xmath50 .",
    "this is the desired duality relation for the 2-point correlation function .    to compute the correlation ( [ ncorrelation ] ) for @xmath3 , we use ( [ prob ] ) and",
    "note that one can apply the fundamental duality relation ( [ dual ] ) to @xmath23 to write the partition function @xmath51 in the form of z = qqc z^ * = ( qq)^2 c z^*_00;00 .",
    "[ zz ] substituting ( [ a ] ) and ( [ zz ] ) into ( [ ncorrelation ] ) , one is led to the result _ 2 & = & ( q-1 ) p_01;00 + ( q-1 ) p_00;01 + ( q-1)(q-1 ) p_01;01 + & = & * v*_2(q)_2(q)-1 , [ g2 ] where p_; z^*_;/ z^*_00;00 , , , , = 0,1 , [ gamma2 ] with _",

    "the expression ( [ gamma2 ] ) generalizes the @xmath52 result for the potts model @xcite .",
    "for the 3-point correlation functions , we apply the fundamental duality relation to the auxiliary graph shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , and extract from the resulting expression the desired duality relation . now for @xmath53 there are 25 independent 3-point correlation functions and the algebra tends to be involved .",
    "the procedure of @xcite can nevertheless be carried through , and the result can be expressed compactly as suggested by ( [ zz ] ) as follows .",
    "introduce a @xmath54 matrix @xmath55 whose elements are the 3-point correlation functions _ 3= , and similarly for @xmath56 .",
    "then , we find _ 3= ( c ) * t*_3(q)^*_3(q ) [ z3 ] where _ 3(q)= .",
    "the 3-point correlation ( [ ncorrelation ] ) can be computed straightforwardly using ( [ z3 ] ) and the identity z= ( qq)^2 c z^*_000;000 .",
    "this leads to the compact expression which extends ( [ g2 ] ) , _ 3=*v*_3(q)_3(q)-1 , where the row vector @xmath57 and the @xmath58 matrix * p*@xmath59 are given by _",

    "we have obtained the duality relations for the 2- and 3-site boundary correlation functions for the @xmath1 model , which includes the @xmath60 ashkin - teller model as a special case .",
    "explicit expressions are also obtained for the 2- and 3-point correlations .",
    "our results are presented in compact forms which are suggestive of possible extensions to higher correlations and to the chiral potts model @xcite .",
