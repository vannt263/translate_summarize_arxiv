    "heavy fermion ( hf ) systems are a class of intermetallic compounds in which electronic correlation effects are particularly pronounced . in hf materials the correlation effects manifest themselves as a strong increase of the effective mass of the charge carriers at low temperatures accompanied with a crossover to the behavior of a landau fermi liquid @xcite .",
    "hybridization between originally localized @xmath1-states and the itinerant band states of these mainly @xmath2- and @xmath3-based compounds is causing this behavior .",
    "in special cases , either by chemical substitution or by external stimuli , such as applying pressure or a magnetic field , a sub - class of the hf system can be tuned into a quantum critical state @xcite . in this state ,",
    "characterized by the shift of a magnetic phase transition to @xmath4 , magnetic fluctuations exert their influence not only at @xmath4 but also at higher temperatures and cause strong deviations from landau s fermi liquid behavior .",
    "consequently , these materials are said to behave as non - fermi liquids . in these non - fermi liquids the low lying charge excitations",
    "can not be simply described as quasi - particle excitations .",
    "nevertheless , superconducting ( sc ) condensates can form in the non - fermi liquid state which is , e.g. , the case for @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the nature of the sc state in this hf material is therefore particularly interesting .",
    "several experiments , such as magnetic field dependent heat conductivity @xcite , specific heat @xcite and also point contact spectroscopy @xcite have provided evidence for a @xmath5 order parameter .",
    "as has been demonstrated for selected high temperature superconductors , phase sensitive experiments employing the josephson effect can be very helpful in elucidating the order parameter type in a very direct way .",
    "this pathway for hf superconductors is , however , difficult to follow .",
    "it mainly relies on the availability of epitaxial thin films . for",
    "selected materials efforts in this direction have been successful @xcite and have eventually led to well characterized tunnel junctions @xcite . for @xmath0 , however , attempts by severals groups have so far not led to epitaxial growth @xcite .",
    "as a possible way out of this difficulty we have previously developed a technique for addressing individual growth domains or microcrystals in @xmath6-axis oriented thin films of @xmath0 by combining focused ion beam ( fib ) etching and focused particle beam induced deposition with appropriate precursors @xcite . in this work",
    "we take advantage of the de - wetting tendency during early stages of @xmath0 thin film growth on @xmath7-plane sapphire for selecting an individual growth domain or microcrystal of about two micrometer lateral dimensions suitable for the fabrication of a microbridge - based squid . both , the squid loop and the individual microbridges exhibit well - defined voltage modulations in an external magnetic field .",
    "the microbridges critical dc josephson current is in good agreement with the ambegaokar - baratoff ( ab ) model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the dynamic resistance we see clear signatures of periodic vortex motion in the microbridges .",
    "these results point towards a very promising approach for phase sensitive studies in hf superconductors .",
    "the @xmath0 thin film was grown on a @xmath8mm@xmath9 @xmath10plane @xmath11 substrate by molecular beam epitaxy method with the growth details and a typical surface morphology reported earlier @xcite .",
    "the thin film was pre - patterned with conventional ultra violet photolithography and ion beam etching .",
    "the micro - structuring ( see fig .  1 ( a ) and ( b ) ) was performed with fib milling in an fei nova nanolab 600 dual beam scanning electron microscope ( sem ) . the outer electrodes ( not shown in the figure ) were metallic @xmath12-composite leads prepared by fib induced deposition using @xmath13 as precursor gas .",
    "a sem micrograph of the prepared squid is shown in fig .",
    "1c and a detailed view of one of the microbridges in the inset .",
    "the electrical measurements were performed in a @xmath14 cryostat employing a four - probe method and a standard differential resistance measurement technique using current modulation .",
    ", as a mean value between the outer and inner diameters , respectively .",
    "the estimated microbridges length and width are @xmath15 and width @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the film thickness is about @xmath17.,width=302 ]",
    "the four - probe resistance of the loop was measured during cool down at a small constant current @xmath18 , and its low temperature region is shown in the inset of fig .  2 .",
    "the complete curve shows the typical behavior for @xmath0 , as was reported for microcrystal measurements before @xcite .",
    "the residual resistance ratio @xmath19 was found to be 2.9 , and is slightly better than in the aforementioned work . however , this value is still small when compared to the value for bulk crystals , which indicates a lower crystal quality for this microcrystal .",
    "the resistivity at @xmath20 is also slightly larger than was reported for single crystals @xcite .",
    "the onset of superconductivity is found at @xmath21 , somewhat lower than that of a bulk crystal .",
    "another smooth transition is found at around @xmath22 , which we attribute to the josephson coupling temperature @xmath23 .",
    "this transition we ascribe to the sc transition in the bridges , and the local @xmath24 being reduced by the fib milling process . also , an important feature is the finite resistance @xmath25 ( also when @xmath26 ) at the lowest temperature , which we explain as follows .",
    "thermally activated processes may fundamentally modify the voltage - to - current @xmath27 relation of a josephson junction .",
    "in particular , as was shown by ambegaokar and halperin @xcite , there is always a finite resistance even below the josephson critical current @xmath28 .",
    "this may be viewed as an overdamped junction , i.e. a junction for which the mccumber parameter is small , which is expected to be the case for microbridges @xcite .",
    "the theoretical analysis of bridges whose dimensions are large compared to the ginsburg - landau ( gl ) coherence length @xmath29 is difficult . for large ratios of @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    "the bridge leaves the regime of the ideal josephson behavior and enters the abricosov vortex motion regime , as was pointed out by likharev @xcite . as a result , essential characteristics of the bridge are modified , such as the shape of squid voltage modulations or the dependence @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the dimensions of our bridges when compared with @xmath33 @xcite make both ratios @xmath34 and @xmath35 large .",
    "associated to the josephson coupling temperature @xmath23 .",
    "note the non - zero resistivity even at the lowest temperatures.,width=302 ]    in the main part of fig .",
    "2 we show a set of measured dynamic resistance curves as a function of current plotted for selected temperatures . the curves measured above @xmath24 show an anomalous background resistance , visible up to @xmath36 , out of which evolves the sc state .",
    "this nonlinearity , which we do not attribute to self heating effects , will be addressed in a separate publication .",
    "signatures of superconductivity become evident on top of the background anomaly at about @xmath21 and become more pronounced as the temperature decreases . at temperatures below @xmath23",
    "the curves develop additional features , which we marked by arrows on the lowest curve .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "3 shows typical measured squid voltage oscillations as a function of an externally applied magnetic field .",
    "the oscillations are well reproducible and of sine - like shape without asymmetries .",
    "the period of the measured oscillations corresponds to one flux quantum @xmath37 over the averaged loop area with excellent agreement . occasionally , the oscillations become phase - shifted by a random amount .",
    "since the oscillations are a measure of the sc phase difference between the two sc arms modulated by an external magnetic field , we attribute these phase slips to randomly trapped flux . the main part of fig .",
    "3 shows a long period modulation superimposed with the squid modulations , which appear as a band due to the scale .",
    "we ascribe them to the josephson modulations of the two individual bridges .",
    "these oscillations are also affected by random phase slips .",
    "their perturbed periodicity might be caused by interference effects between both bridges , since they are coupled by the sc wave function in the arms .",
    "a rough estimate of the period for these oscillations gives @xmath38 , and according to @xmath39 implies that the effective dimensions of each bridge extend into each sc bank by about @xmath40 , which compares favorably with the london penetration depth @xmath41 for @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the observed strong manifestation of the josephson effect enables us to analyze the peculiarities of the transport characteristics at low temperatures in the framework of models developed for the josephson effect in microbridges @xcite .",
    "the aslamazov - larkin ( al ) theory @xcite may be used for the analysis of the @xmath27 characteristics of microbridges of a geometry similar to ours when vortex dynamics has to be accounted for , i.e. @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in the framework of this model",
    "the electrical current density across the bridge is non - uniform , and is described as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the total current along the bridge , @xmath46 is the bridge thickness , @xmath7 is equal to @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the coordinate along the width of the bridge with @xmath49 at the bridge center .",
    "it may be shown that two vortices of opposite helicity are most likely to enter the bridge from opposite edges due to the locally highest current density there .    as is shown in the al model ,",
    "the total force acting on the @xmath50 vortex is @xmath51 . here , @xmath52 is the lorentz force due to the interaction with current @xmath45 , @xmath53 is the interaction with the edge , and @xmath54 is the vortex - vortex interaction term . at low t",
    "a vortex remains pinned to the edge due to @xmath53 as long as the counteracting lorentz force is @xmath55 . neglecting the @xmath54 term when the number of vortices in the bridge is small",
    ", one may derive the current at which @xmath56 as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 . at this and",
    "larger currents vortex pairs start a periodic viscous motion toward the bridge center with successive annihilation and new creation of a vortex pair at the edges . as the @xmath45 and",
    "@xmath52 increase , more than one vortex pair may be present simultaneously within the bridge giving a discontinuity on the @xmath27 curve .",
    "however , due to the associated increase of the @xmath54 , any succeeding current span will differ from the previous one .",
    "the equation of motion of the @xmath50 vortex is given by @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the viscosity coefficient .",
    "finally , solving this equation one finds the period of moving vortices , which is equal to the period @xmath61 in the josephson frequency relation @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the averaged measured voltage .",
    "hence , the electrical current @xmath45 is related with @xmath63 . according to the al model discontinuities on the @xmath27 curves",
    "are periodic in the voltage",
    ". one may show that this periodicity is given by ( si units ) :    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the effective penetration depth , which we take as @xmath41 , since @xmath66 and the correction is small .",
    "we attribute the smoothed peaks marked with arrows in fig .  2 each to a new number of vortex pairs moving simultaneously in the bridge .",
    "they appear , as expected , just above @xmath28 .",
    "three corresponding peaks are well resolved , which in our case implies that the strong repulsion between neighbored vortices of equal helicity limits considerably their number .",
    "this is very probable because the average inter - vortex distance @xmath67 is comparable with the vortex radius .",
    "also , large values of @xmath68 @xcite for @xmath0 do increase the inter - vortex repulsive coupling .",
    "the peaks are not equidistant with current , which is also expected from the al model , but the voltage peaks are equidistant with a period of about @xmath69 with good accuracy .",
    "this periodicity we ascribe to @xmath70 as predicted by the al model .",
    "one may obtain the viscosity coefficient @xmath60 from eq .",
    "( 1 ) . using @xmath71 , the approximate thickness in the bridge as @xmath72 , and @xmath73 @xcite we find @xmath74 .",
    "the agreement with the bardeen - stephen theory @xcite is good , which gives @xmath75 using @xmath76 and the normal state resistivity @xmath77 .",
    "denote the josephson coupling temperature .",
    "the measured value of the normal state resistance @xmath78 , while effective one used for the ab fit is @xmath79 .",
    "the measured @xmath28 at the lowest temperature is @xmath80,width=283 ]    a temperature dependence of the reduced josephson critical current @xmath28 for the two bridges is shown in fig .",
    "the dots represent measured data and the solid lines are theoretical curves for several cases using the measured @xmath23 and the normal state resistance @xmath81 .",
    "it is clear that the ab model @xcite fits the data well , although @xmath82 has to be used instead of the measured value of 42@xmath83 .",
    "this is not unexpected . on the one hand",
    ", the ab fit tends to overestimate the value of @xmath28 for @xmath43 , since @xmath81 growth linearly with @xmath84 but the gl order parameter in the middle of the bridge falls off exponentially . on the other hand ,",
    "the ab model is derived for tunnel junctions , that is @xmath85 and with no scattering within the barrier . in contradistinction , models derived for microconstrictions , such as that by kulik and omelyanchuk , in the dirty and clean limit @xcite or ishii s model @xcite for long bridges do not fit the data .",
    "additionally , the shape of the voltage modulations are not asymmetric , as expected in these models .",
    "we have to state that the observed @xmath32 dependence does not follow the probably expected behavior theoretically predicted for microbridges in the dirty or clean limit .",
    "these models do not take a possible influence of andreev bound states @xcite for a @xmath46-wave order parameter into account , which may be one reason for this discrepancy .",
    "the clean squid characteristics observed in this work on selected @xmath0 microcrystals allow for two main conclusions .",
    "first , the fact that the micro - patterning approach used here is not detrimental to the superconducting state in @xmath0 indicates a certain robustness of this state .",
    "considering , as a rule , the high sensitivity of the superconducting properties in other heavy - fermion superconductors , this may point toward an enhanced stability of the superconducting state when formed from a non - fermi liquid .",
    "second , the approach followed here provides junctions with rather close - to - ideal characteristics , which is promising with regard to utilizing other microbridge geometries .",
    "these geometries , such as recently proposed by gumann and schopohl @xcite or also a @xmath86-junction structure , which can e.g. be formed by the combination of a conventional sc lead prepared by focused ion beam induced deposition using the @xmath13 precursor with a @xmath0 microcrystal , can provide phase - sensitive information about the superconducting state in @xmath0 .",
    "work along these lines is in progress .",
    "we would like to acknowledge the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) for financial support under grant no .",
    "hu 752/3 - 3 and martin jourdan for granting access to an ion beam etching facility .",
