    "plastic scintillation detectors have been used in nuclear and high energy physics for many decades @xcite .",
    "their advantages and disadvantages are recognized . among their benefits",
    "are fast response , ease of manufacture and versatility .",
    "their main drawbacks are radiation resistance and cost .",
    "many research projects have concentrated on improving the fundamental properties of plastic scintillators @xcite , but little attention has focussed on their cost .",
    "currently available plastic scintillating materials are high quality products whose cost is relatively expensive , and because of that , their use in very large detectors has not been a feasible option . for instance , minos ( main injector neutrino oscillation search ) will require 400,000 kg of plastic scintillator for its detector @xcite . with the price of cast scintillator at approximately $ 40 per kg , such a detector would not be affordable .",
    "however , recent studies using commercial polystyrene pellets as the base material for extrudable plastic scintillators have allowed the minos collaboration to consider a less expensive alternative in building a plastic scintillation detector .",
    "furthermore , the d0 experiment at fermilab has been able to use extruded plastic scintillator to build and upgrade their forward and central preshower detectors . in this case , the driving force was not the cost of the material , since only 2,000 kg of plastic scintillator were needed , but the opportunity to use a particular shape ( triangular bar ) that would have been expensive to machine out of cast plastic scintillator sheets @xcite .",
    "several factors contribute to the high cost of plastic scintillating sheets and wavelength shifting fibers .",
    "the main reason is the labor - intensive nature of the manufacturing process .",
    "the raw materials , namely styrene , vinyltoluene , and the dopants , need to be highly pure .",
    "these purification steps often take place just prior to the material utilization .",
    "cleaning and assembly of the molds for the polymerization process is a detail - oriented operation that adds to the overall timeline .",
    "the polymerization cycle lasts several days .",
    "it consists of a high temperature treatment to induce full conversion from monomer to polymer , followed by a controlled ramp - down to room temperature to achieve a stress - free material .",
    "finally , there are machining charges for sheets and tiles , and drawing charges for fibers that can not be overlooked .    in order to significantly lower the cost of plastic scintillators , extruded plastic scintillation materials need to be considered . in an extrusion process ,",
    "polymer pellets or powder must be used .",
    "commercial polystyrene pellets are readily available , thus eliminating monomer purification and polymerization charges .",
    "in addition , extrusion can manufacture nearly any shape , increasing detector geometry options .",
    "there are , however , some important disadvantages .",
    "the extruded plastic scintillator is known to have poorer optical quality than the cast material .",
    "the main cause is high particulate matter content within the polystyrene pellets .",
    "general purpose polystyrene pellets are utilized in numerous products but few of them have strict optical requirements . a way to bypass",
    "the short attenuation length problem is to extrude a scintillator shape and use a wavelength shifting ( wls ) fiber as readout .",
    "our first approach was a two - step process that involved adding dopants to commercial polystyrene pellets to produce scintillating polystyrene pellets , which were then used to extrude a scintillator profile with a hole in the middle for a wls fiber ( figure  [ rect ] ) .",
    "the goal in the first step was to prepare scintillating pellets of acceptable optical quality in a factory environment .",
    "in addition to careful selection of the raw materials , the manufacturing concerns dealt with possible discoloration of the scintillating pellets because of either residues present in the equipment or degradation of the polymer pellets and the dopants in the processing device .",
    "the latter could be induced by the presence of oxygen at the high temperatures and pressures which constitute the typical operating conditions .",

    "samples of standard cast scintillators such as bc404 and bc408 , and samples prepared through bulk polymerization at fermilab were also included in the studies ( table i ) .",
    "all the samples had similar dopant composition and were cut as 2-cm cubes .",
    "the light yield measurements were performed using a @xmath0bi source ( 1 mev electrons ) .",
    "the light yield results ( table i ) showed no significant difference among them .",
    "the bicron samples are made of poly(vinyltoluene ) instead of polystyrene which accounts for the 20% increase in light output @xcite .",
    "the samples for radiation damage studies were placed in stainless steel cans and connected to a vacuum pump for two weeks to remove dissolved air and moisture .",
    "the cans were then back - filled with nitrogen and irradiated with a @xmath1co source at the phoenix memorial laboratory of the university of michigan .",
    "the irradiations took place at a rate of approximately 15 kgy / h to a total dose of 1 kgy .",
    "after irradiation and annealing , the extruded scintillator cubes showed a 5% decrease in light yield which is similar to the losses observed in regular scintillator of this composition . based on these tests , there was no sign of degradation in the scintillating pellets .",
    "the material was then used to produce extruded scintillator of different profiles with a hole in the middle for a wls fiber .     +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "research on extruded plastic scintillator was driven by the high cost of cast plastic scintillator .",
    "the goal was to use commercially available polystyrene pellets , in particular from a general purpose grade , and standard extrusion equipment to lower the price of plastic scintillators .",
    "extruded plastic scintillator strips have been manufactured and tested . the estimated price for extruded scintillator ranges from $ 3.5/kg to $ 6/kg . about 50% of the cost is due to raw materials with the remaining 50% due to processing .",
    "the results indicate that the extruded scintillator profile with a wls fiber as readout is a valid system for scintillation detectors .",
