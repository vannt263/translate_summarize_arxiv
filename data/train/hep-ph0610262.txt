    "although nowadays qcd is regarded as the fundamental theory responsible for all the strong interaction phenomenology , we are still far from a sheer understanding of many of its features .    within the light quark sector and in the low energy regime ( e @xmath3 )",
    "qcd exhibits a spontaneous breakdown of the chiral symmetry .",
    "it is believed that the operator responsible for this phenomenon is the quark condensate @xmath2 , which acquires a non - vanishing value .",
    "phenomenologically , this feature is reflected through the appearance in the spectrum of the so called pseudo - goldstone bosons .",
    "the effective theory governing their dynamics is chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath0pt ) @xcite .",
    "this theory consists in an expansion of the physical observables in terms of the momentum and quark masses . in the deep euclidean region ( @xmath4 )",
    "one can use the operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite , which is a series in inverse powers of momentum , each term multiplied by the appropriate qcd operator .    for the intermediate region",
    "there is only one known expansion parameter , namely @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "large @xmath6 tells us that this region is dominated by the hadronic resonances , that dictate their dynamics and implies that there must be an infinite number of them .",
    "all these features can be put together in a lagrangian formalism known as the resonance chiral theory ( r@xmath0 t ) @xcite .",
    "still we lack a method to handle an infinite tower of them , and then the so called minimal hadronic ansatz ( mha ) is usually used , meaning that we only consider the lowest lying ones .",
    "one is then able to perform a matching of the three regimes and thence to estimate the values of the low energy constants ( lec s ) of the @xmath0pt lagrangian @xcite .",
    "some effort has been done to push this study towards @xmath5 corrections through resonance loops @xcite and in the direction of including more resonances in the ansatz @xcite .",
    "order parameter green functions are those which in the chiral limit have no purely perturbative term in the ope and thus their leading contribution results from the @xmath2 operator . since this operator is the responsible for the chiral symmetry breaking those green functions encode essential information for a better understanding of confinement .    so far only the @xmath7 has been calculated . in this work",
    "we perform the first gluonic corrections @xcite which translates into scale and logarithm dependences",
    ". this might be useful for a scale dependence determination of the lec s and for including the full tower of resonances .",
    "the qcd currents are colour singlets quarks bilinears . in general",
    "they can be written as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the gell - mann matrices of the su(3 ) group in flavour space and @xmath10 is a dirac matrix .",
    "the mathematical definition of the green functions is as follows : @xmath11 the expectation value in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def-3 ] ) is to be understood with respect to the non - perturbative qcd vacuum .",
    "this vacuum is responsible for the breakdown of the chiral symmetry .",
    "the ope master formula expands the green functions into an infinite sum of local operators where the dependences in the space - time coordinates are enclosed in the wilson coefficients:@xmath12 in this work we deal with functions with @xmath13 to all orders in @xmath14 .",
    "these are called order parameteres of the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we will concentrate on the @xmath14 correction to the wilson coefficient @xmath15 .",
    "the vector and axial - vector currents are conserved in the chiral limit .",
    "this fact is reflected in the green functions through the ward identities . the ward identity which the @xmath16 correlator must follow fixes completely in a non - perturbative way its structure @xcite : @xmath17 and so does not get any @xmath1 correction .",
    "the only hadron interchanged by the two currents is a pseudo - goldstone boson .",
    "two point functions are of special interest since at tree level they only receive contributions from single goldstone and resonance exchange .",
    "let us concentrate in the @xmath18 correlator , which except for the @xmath16 is the only two point order parameter of the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "vector meson resonances are interchanged between the two currents . from general principles",
    "it can be inferred that : @xmath19 fig .",
    "[ cap:2-point - tree ] shows all the diagrams entering the @xmath20 for a two point correlator and fig .",
    "[ cap:2-point - tree ] their first order gluonic corrections .    in fig .",
    "[ cap:2-point - gluonic ] one observes there are gluons attached to quark propagators with zero incoming momenta and this may cause infrared divergences . in order to regularize these divergences we use dimensional regularization .",
    "doing so , one can not distinguish between ultraviolet and infrared ones , all of them manifest as @xmath21 ( and @xmath22 ) and hence the total divergence of a diagram is the sum of both . in this scheme",
    "only the box diagram has an infrared divergence .",
    "the divergence of this diagram is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the arbitrary gauge parameter of qcd . ] .",
    "together with the tree level amplitude we get the structure : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and the subscript @xmath28 stands for renormalized and @xmath29 for bare .",
    "we have used the fact that the product @xmath30 is a renormalization group invariant quantity and so the divergence is absorbed in the renormalization of the condensate .",
    "after renormalization the final result reads @xcite :    @xmath31\\right\\}\\label{vtresult},\\ ] ]    which is independent of the @xmath24 parameter , required by gauge invariance and it is also a good check for our calculation .",
    "the case of three point functions is of great interest because of several reasons .",
    "first , unlike the two point case , there is a quite big amount of them that are order parameters of the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "second , in the framework of r@xmath0 t it involves vertices among resonances and so it is useful to learn how they interact .",
    "third , there are a lot of @xmath0pt lec s that can be determined with these green functions . and",
    "fourth , by means of the lsz reduction formula we can relate the green functions with form factors entering the calculation of many interesting hadronic observables . some phenomenological applications of these functions can be found in ref .",
    "[ cap:3-point - tree ] accounts for the @xmath20 contribution and fig .",
    "[ cap:3-point - gluonic ] represents their first order gluonic corrections .    due to the length of the results of this section",
    "we will not include explicit expressions , which can be found in ref .",
    "these three point functions can be divided into two subsets : odd and even intrinsic parity sector .",
    "the first set contains three green functions , namely @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . due to ward identities and time reversal ,",
    "the three of them can be written as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 can be either @xmath37 or @xmath38 depending on the time reversal properties of the green function .",
    "all these functions are finite and do not need renormalization .    in the even intrinsic parity sector",
    "we have two groups . @xmath39 and @xmath40 need to be renormalized ; @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are finite .",
    "each one of the latter have only two independent lorentz structures , what defines two form factors .",
    "the definitions of the anomalous dimensions of the qcd parameters , currents and operators are the following : @xmath44 since @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are renormalization group invariant objects , then @xmath48 , and since @xmath49 and @xmath50 currents are conserved @xmath51 . on the other hand : @xmath52 and under the conditions of order parameters in the chiral limit eq .",
    "( [ weinbergformula ] ) leads to : @xmath53 which tell us the scale dependence of the green functions .",
    "the mass anomalous dimension appears in ( [ rge ] ) as a consequence of the running of the @xmath54 operator , the only one playing a role ( the @xmath55 function is already @xmath56 ) . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath57 there is no explicit @xmath58-dependence .",
    "all our results follow the renormalization group equations derived presented in this section , which is a good consistency check @xcite .",
    "we have shown that after a correct understanding of the infrared divergences present in the order parameter green functions of the chiral symmetry breaking those cancel out .",
    "moreover they are responsible for the running of @xmath2 .",
    "we have written renormalization group equations for all our green functions and our results follow the scale dependence derived from them .",
    "these results might be used to compute corrections to some spectral sum rules analyis so far done at leading order .",
    "but its main utility is to understand how to go beyond the minimal hadronic ansatz and how to include @xmath1 corrections and scale dependence to the @xmath0pt lec s determination by imposing the short distance constraints ( now with a logarithmic dependence ) .",
    "now we understand the problems arising when matching sss and spp results of ope and r@xmath0 t @xcite , but still we do not know how to solve them @xcite .      this work has been supported in part by eu flavianet network ( mrtn - ct-2006 - 035482 ) , the spanish ministry of education and science ( grant fpa2004 - 00996 ) , generalitat valenciana ( grupos03/013 and gv05 - 164 ) and by erdf funds from the eu commission .    9 s.  weinberg , physica a * 96 * ( 1979 ) 327 ; j.  gasser and h.  leutwyler , ann .",
