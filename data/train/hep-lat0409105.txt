    "it is widely accepted that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite is the fundamental theory of the strong interaction for hadrons and nuclei .",
    "nevertheless , it still remains as a difficult problem to derive low - energy physical quantities directly from qcd in an analytic manner .",
    "the perturbative qcd calculation , which successfully describes the high - energy process , can not be applied at the hadronic scale , since the qcd coupling constant becomes large in the infrared region .",
    "furthermore , the strong - coupling nature of qcd leads to a highly nontrival vacuum with rich nonperturbative phenomena such as color confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .    in this decade",
    ", the lattice - qcd monte carlo calculation has been recognized as a reliable nonperturbative method for the quantitative analysis of qcd , and the nonperturbative analysis based on qcd has become one of the central and important issues in the hadron physics .",
    "for instance , lattice qcd calculations successfully reproduce hadron mass spectra  @xcite and also predict the qcd phase transition at finite temperatures and densities  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the underlying structure of hadrons is not yet well investigated using lattice qcd .",
    "in fact , the application of lattice qcd is just beginning for the research of the hadron structure and related excitation modes in terms of quarks and gluons .",
    "the investigation on the hadron structure and the excitation modes has a long history in the particle physics . in 1969 , y.  nambu first pointed out the string picture for hadrons  @xcite to explain the veneziano amplitude  @xcite on hadron reactions and resonances . since then , the string picture has been one of the most important scenarios for hadrons  @xcite and has provided many interesting ideas in the wide region of the elementary particle physics  @xcite . for instance",
    ", the hadronic string creates infinite number of hadron resonances as the vibrational modes , and these excitations lead to the hagedorn `` ultimate '' temperature  @xcite , which gives an interesting theoretical picture for the qcd phase transition .    for real hadrons ,",
    "the hadronic string has a spatial extension like a `` flux - tube ''  @xcite , as the result of one - dimensional squeezing of the color - electric flux in accordance with color confinement  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the vibrational modes of the hadronic flux - tube should be much more complicated , and the analysis of the excitation modes is important to clarify the underlying picture for real hadrons .    in the language of qcd",
    ", such non - quark - origin excitation is called as the `` gluonic excitation ''  @xcite , and is physically interpreted as the excitation of the gluon - field configuration in the presence of the quark - antiquark pair or the three quarks in a color - singlet state .    in the hadron physics ,",
    "the gluonic excitation is one of the interesting phenomena beyond the quark model , and relates to the hybrid hadrons such as @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the valence picture .",
    "for instance , the hybrid meson includes the exotic hadrons with the exotic quantum number such as @xmath8 , which can not be constructed in the simple quark model  @xcite .",
    "then , it is important to investigate the gluonic excitation with lattice qcd , not only from the theoretical viewpoint but also from the experimental viewpoint .    in this paper",
    ", we study the excited - state three - quark ( 3q ) potential and the gluonic excitation in baryons using lattice qcd  @xcite , to get deeper insight on these excitations beyond the hypothetical models such as the string and the flux - tube models . in qcd ,",
    "the excited - state 3q potential is defined as the energy of the excited state of the gluon - field configuration in the presence of the static three quarks , and the gluonic - excitation energy is expressed as the energy difference between the ground - state 3q potential @xcite and the excited - state 3q potential .    note that the inter - quark potential is one of the most fundamental quantities directly connected to color confinement , and plays the important role for hadron properties . as for the q-@xmath9 system",
    ", a lot of lattice qcd studies  @xcite have shown that the ground - state q-@xmath9 potential @xmath10 is well described by the coulomb plus linear potential , @xmath11 with the inter - quark distance @xmath12 .",
    "its behavior at short distances can be explained by the coulomb interaction from the one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) process , and the linear confinement term seems to indicate the flux - tube picture  @xcite , where the quark and the antiquark are linked by one dimensional flux - tube with the string tension of @xmath13 gev / fm .    in qcd ,",
    "the three - body force among three quarks is also a `` primary '' force reflecting the su(3 ) gauge symmetry , while the three - body force is regarded as a residual interaction in most fields in physics .",
    "in fact , the 3q potential is directly responsible for the structure and properties of baryons , similar to the relevant role of the q-@xmath14 potential for meson properties , and both the q-@xmath14 potential and the 3q potential are equally important fundamental quantities in qcd .",
    "furthermore , the 3q potential is the key quantity to clarify the quark confinement mechanism in baryons .",
    "however , in contrast with the q-@xmath9 potential , there were only a few preliminary lattice - qcd works @xcite done in 1980 s for the ground - state 3q potential before our first study in 1999  @xcite .",
    "since 1999 , we have performed accurate calculations and detailed analyses of the ground - state 3q potential @xmath3 in lattice qcd with the smearing method for more than 300 different patterns of 3q systems @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , we have shown that the ground - state 3q potential @xmath3 is well described by the coulomb plus y - type linear potential , i.e. , the y - ansatz , @xmath15 within 1%-level deviation . here , @xmath16 denotes the minimal value of the total length of color - flux - tubes linking the three quarks  @xcite , which is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.lmin ] .",
    "we have found two remarkable features , the universality of the string tension as @xmath17 and the oge result as @xmath18 .",
    "( very recently , we show that the multi - quark potential is well described by the oge coulomb plus multi - y type linear potential  @xcite , which also supports the y - ansatz . )",
    ". there appears a physical junction linking the three flux tubes at the fermat point p. [ fig.lmin ] ]    we briefly summarize several other recent studies on the ground - state 3q potential to clarify the current status of the y - ansatz .",
    "after our first study , de forcrand s group tested only about 20 equilateral 3q configurations in lattice qcd , and supported the @xmath19-ansatz @xcite .",
    "however , their data seem to indicate the y - ansatz with an overall constant shift , and the deviation seems to originate from the data at very short distances , where the linear potential is negligible compared with the coulomb contribution .",
    "( also , their usage of the continuum coulomb potential may be problematic for the lattice data at very short distances . ) recently , de forcrand s group seems to change their opinion from the @xmath19-ansatz to the y - ansatz @xcite .",
    "one of the theoretical basis of the @xmath19-ansatz was cornwall s conjecture based on the vortex vacuum model @xcite .",
    "very recently , motivated by our studies , cornwall re - examined his previous work and found an error in the model calculation . the corrected answer was the y - ansatz instead of the @xmath19-ansatz @xcite .",
    "as another analytical work , kuzmenko and simonov also showed that the delta - shape is impossible from gauge - invariance point of view , and the y - shaped configuration is the only possible for the 3q system @xcite .",
    "as a clear evidence for the y - ansatz , ichie et al . performed the direct measurement on the action density in the spatially - fixed 3q system in lattice qcd using the maximally - abelian projection , and observed a clear y - type flux - tube profile @xcite .    in this way , the y - ansatz is also supported by various studies of other groups @xcite , and therefore the y - ansatz for the ground - state 3q potential is almost settled both in lattice qcd and in analytic framework .    as for the excited - state 3q potential",
    ", however , there is no lattice qcd study besides our previous work  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we present the detailed analysis of the excited - state 3q potential and the gluonic excitation for about 100 different patterns of the 3q static systems in su(3 ) lattice qcd at the quenched level .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we give a necessary formalism on the relation between the 3q wilson loop and the qcd hamiltonian .",
    "we then give the lattice qcd formalism to extract the excited - state 3q potential in section  [ sec3 ] , and show the lattice qcd results in section  [ sec4 ] . in section  [ sec5 ]",
    ", we investigate the functional form of the gluonic excitation energy from the lattice qcd data . in section  [ sec6 ]",
    ", we discuss the physical implication of the obtained lattice results , and consider the physical reason of the success of the quark model for low - lying hadrons in terms of the gluonic excitation .",
    "section  [ sec7 ] is devoted to the summary and the conclusion .",
    "to begin with , let us consider the physical modes in the static 3q system .",
    "we denote the @xmath20th excited state by @xmath21 ( @xmath20=0,1,2,3 , .. ) for the physical eigenstates of the qcd hamiltonian @xmath22 for the spatially - fixed 3q system . for the simple notation ,",
    "the ground state is expressed as the `` 0th excited state '' in this paper .",
    "since the three quarks are spatially fixed in this case , the eigenvalue of @xmath22 is expressed by the static 3q potential as @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the @xmath20th excited - state 3q potential .",
    "we take the normalization condition as @xmath25 .",
    "note that both @xmath24 and @xmath21 are universal physical quantities related to the qcd hamiltonian @xmath22 .",
    "the 3q wilson loop @xmath26 .",
    "the gauge - covariant 3q state @xmath27 is generated at @xmath28 and is annihilated at @xmath29 .",
    "the three quarks are spatially fixed in @xmath30 for @xmath31 . ]",
    "similar to the calculation of the q-@xmath32 potential with the wilson loop , the 3q potential can be calculated with the 3q wilson loop @xmath26 defined as @xmath33 with @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) . here",
    ", @xmath36 denotes the path - ordered product along the path denoted by @xmath37 in fig .",
    "[ fig.3qloop ] .    in the 3q wilson loop ,",
    "a gauge - covariant 3q state @xmath27 is generated at @xmath28 and is annihilated at @xmath29 with the three quarks being spatially fixed in @xmath30 for @xmath31 . in general , the 3q state @xmath27 in the 3q wilson loop is not an eigenstate of the qcd hamiltonian @xmath22 for the spatially - fixed 3q system , and can be expressed with a linear combination of the 3q physical eigenstates @xmath38 ( @xmath20=0,1,2 .. ) as @xmath39 where the complex coefficients @xmath40 satisfy @xmath41 and express the overlap with each state @xmath21 in the 3q wilson loop .    since the euclidean time evolution of the 3q state @xmath42",
    "is expressed with the operator @xmath43 , which corresponds to the transfer matrix in lattice qcd , the expectation value of the 3q wilson loop is expressed as @xmath44    then , the low - lying potentials , e.g. , the ground - state potential @xmath45 and the 1st excited - state potential @xmath46 , can be obtained from the large-@xmath47 behavior of @xmath48 where higher excited - state contributions are negligible . in practical lattice simulations , however , it is difficult to calculate @xmath48 accurately for large @xmath47 , since its value decreases exponentially with @xmath47 .    therefore , for the accurate calculation of low - lying potentials , it is desired to reduce higher excited - state components in the 3q state @xmath49 in the 3q wilson loop .",
    "for this purpose , we use the smearing method  @xcite to reduce highly excited - state components in the 3q state @xmath49 .",
    "the smearing is just a method for the state composition in a gauge - covariant manner , and never changes physical quantities and gauge configurations , unlike the cooling .",
    "the smearing for link - variables is expressed as the iterative replacement of the spatial link - variable @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) by the obscured link - variable @xmath52 which maximizes @xmath53 \\bigg\\ } , \\label{smear}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] leaving the temporal link - variable @xmath54 unchanged .",
    "note that the smeared 3q wilson loop composed by the smeared link - variable is expressed as a spatially - extended operator in terms of the original link - variable @xmath55 , and therefore the 3q state @xmath49 and the coefficients @xmath40 in the smeared 3q wilson loop are changed according to the iteration number @xmath56 of the smearing .",
    "in other words , the coefficients @xmath40 in the smeared 3q wilson loop can be controlled to some extent in the smearing procedure , by changing the iteration number @xmath56 and the smearing parameter @xmath57 .",
    "for instance , as the iteration number @xmath56 of the smearing increases from @xmath56=0 , the excited - state components in the @xmath58 smeared 3q wilson loop gradually decrease , and finally the 22th ( 42th ) smeared 3q wilson loop is almost ground - state saturated as @xmath59 for @xmath60 on the lattice with @xmath1=5.8 ( 6.0 )  @xcite .",
    "then , with the properly smeared 3q wilson loop @xmath48 , @xmath3 can be accurately calculated as @xmath61 even at relatively small @xmath47 @xcite",
    ".    the smearing method is also useful to extract the low - lying 3q potentials , i.e. , the ground - state potential @xmath3 and the 1st excited - state potential @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present the formalism of the variational method @xcite to extract the excited - state potential and the gluonic excitation by diagonalizing the qcd hamiltonian in the presence of static quarks .",
    "suppose that @xmath62 are arbitrary given independent 3q states for the spatially - fixed 3q system .",
    "in general , each 3q state @xmath63 can be expressed with a linear combination of the 3q physical eigenstates @xmath64 as @xmath65 here , the coefficients @xmath66 depend on the selection of the 3q states @xmath63 , and hence they are not universal quantities .",
    "( unlike the q-@xmath14 system , there is no definite symmetry in the 3q system , so that we do not construct the 3q states which carry the specific quantum number . )",
    "the euclidean time - evolution of the 3q state @xmath42 is expressed with the operator @xmath43 , which corresponds to the transfer matrix in lattice qcd .",
    "the overlap @xmath67 is given by the generalized 3q wilson loop sandwiched by the initial state @xmath68 at @xmath28 and the final state @xmath69 at @xmath29 , and is expressed as the correlation matrix in the euclidean heisenberg picture : @xmath70 we define the matrix @xmath71 and the diagonal matrix @xmath72 by @xmath73 and rewrite the above relation as @xmath74 note here that @xmath71 is not a unitary matrix , and therefore this relation does not mean the simple diagonalization by the unitary transformation , which connects the two matrices by the similarity transformation .",
    "since we are interested in the 3q potential @xmath75 in @xmath72 rather than the non - universal matrix @xmath71 , we single out @xmath76 from the 3q wilson loop @xmath77 using the following prescription . from eq.([3qstate06 ] ) , we obtain @xmath78 now , @xmath79 is expressed by the similarity transformation of the diagonal matrix @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , @xmath81 can be obtained as the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath82 , i.e. , the solutions of the secular equation , @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes the unit matrix .",
    "the largest eigenvalue corresponds to @xmath85 and the @xmath20th largest eigenvalue corresponds to @xmath81 .    in this way",
    ", the 3q potential @xmath86 can be obtained from the matrix @xmath82 . in the practical calculation",
    ", we prepare @xmath87 independent sample states @xmath88 .",
    "if one chooses appropriate states @xmath63 which does not include highly excited - state components , one can truncate the physical states as @xmath89 . then , @xmath77 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are reduced into @xmath90 matrices , and the secular equation eq.([3qstate08 ] )",
    "becomes the @xmath87th order equation .",
    "in this section , we show the lattice qcd result of the 1st excited - state 3q potential @xmath2 and the gluonic excitation energy @xmath5 as well as the ground - state potential @xmath3 for the spatially - fixed static 3q system .",
