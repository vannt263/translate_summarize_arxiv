    "the existing formulae for the one  loop susy qcd corrections to their decay widths have been given in the on  shell expansion for quarks and squarks .",
    "however , for large @xmath1 , these formulae suffer from very bad convergence of the perturbation series , which makes the numerical results unreliable .",
    "we have worked out a method for improving the susy qcd corrections to these widths .",
