    "each term is again a combinatorial analogue of the initial gosset polytope @xmath20 .",
    "just as the 6-dimensional gossett polytope can be represented as a section of the 7-dimensional one , each @xmath21 of the asymmetric sequence can be represented as a section of the @xmath22 of the symmetric sequence .",
    "* properties and connections : * perfect delaunay polytopes are fascinating geometric objects .",
    "there is a number of other reasons why we studied these polytopes .    1 .",
    "perfect delaunay polytopes are maximal delaunay polytopes  it follows immediately from the definition that a perfect delaunay polytope can not fit properly inside another delaunay polytope of the same dimension .",
    "each perfect delaunay polytope @xmath0 uniquely determines a positive definite quadratic form on @xmath4 , which in turn , determines a delaunay tiling of @xmath23 with @xmath0 as one of its delaunay tiles ( details on how these tilings are constructed are given in the following section ) .",
    "therefore , each of our sequences of perfect delaunay polytopes determines a corresponding sequence of delaunay tilings . just as the perfect delaunay polytopes in the sequence are combinatorial analogues , the corresponding delaunay tilings have somewhat similar combinatorial properties .",
    "+ each perfect delaunay polytope in the sequence of @xmath9-topes uniquely determines a delaunay tiling that is an analogue of that for the root lattice @xmath24 in @xmath25 .",
    "similarly , each term in the sequence of @xmath15-topes uniquely determines a delaunay tiling that is an analogue of that for the root lattice @xmath26 in @xmath27 .",
    "a quadratic form @xmath28 in @xmath1 indeterminates is called perfect ( after voronoi ) if it is positive definite and is uniquely determined by its minimal vectors through the linear system of equations @xmath29=\\min_{\\neq0 }   { \\varphi}\\;\\;\\vline\\ ; \\;\\mathbf{m}\\ : \\text{is a minimal vector for } \\:\\varphi\\}$ ] , where the coefficients of @xmath30 are the variables , @xmath31 is the minimal value achieved by @xmath28 on the non - zero elements of @xmath4 , and each equation corresponds a minimal vector @xmath32 for @xmath28 . if @xmath28 is perfect , then the only solution is @xmath33 .",
    "+ there is an inhomogeneous analogue to perfect form that plays an important role in the study of delaunay polytopes .",
    "let @xmath2 be an empty ellipsoid around a delaunay polytope @xmath0 , defined by inequality @xmath34 . since @xmath2 is empty , @xmath35 is non - negative on @xmath4 , and assumes its minimum value zero on @xmath36 . if @xmath0 is perfect then the coefficients of the inhomogeneous quadratic function @xmath35 are determined , up to a scale factor , by the linear system of equations @xmath37 .",
    "the rank of this linear system must then be @xmath13 , which requires a perfect delaunay polytope to have at least this number of vertices .",
    "the vertices of a perfect delaunay polytope are used to determine the coefficients of @xmath35 in much the same way that the minimal vectors are used to determine the coefficients of a perfect form .",
    "therefore , when @xmath0 is perfect it is natural to refer to @xmath35 as a _ perfect quadratic function _ , and to refer to @xmath2 as a _",
    "perfect ellipsoid_. clearly @xmath38 is perfect delaunay in @xmath39 and @xmath40}$ ] is perfect delaunay in @xmath41 .",
    "next perfect delaunay polytope lives in dimension 6 .",
    "+ the conditions that a perfect quadratic function must satisfy are more severe than those for a perfect form , which requires at least @xmath42 pairs of minimal vectors .",
    "this leads to the speculation that the growth of numbers of arithmetic types of perfect quadratic functions with dimension will be much slower than for numbers of types of perfect forms .",
    "this has been borne out by the data now available on perfect delaunay polytopes ( see http://www.liga.ens.fr/~dutour/ ) .",
    "in fact , the growth of numbers of arithmetic types of perfect function seems much slower that that for most classes of geometric objects studied in geometry of numbers .",
    "+ perfect forms have been introduced by korkine and zolotareff ( 1873 ) , who classified all the perfect forms through dimension five ( the term ` perfect ` was coined by voronoi ) .",
    "in addition , they found several perfect forms in higher dimensions , including the forms corresponding to the root lattices @xmath43 , @xmath44 ( both for @xmath45 ) , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , although they used completely different roman letters to denote these lattices .",
    "conway and sloane ( 1988 ) give a survey of perfect forms through dimension seven .",
    "more recently , the study of perfect forms has been taken up by martinet who published a comprehensive monograph on the topic in 2003 . as of the end of 2006 perfect forms",
    "have been classified in dimensions through eight ( see http://fma2.math.uni-magdeburg.de/~latgeo/ ) .",
    "4 .   a significant role for perfect delaunay polytopes is to provide geometric labels for a class of _ edge forms _ for the _ homogeneous domains _ of delaunay tilings of @xmath23 .",
    "these domains , also referred to as l - type domains , are polyhedral cones of positive forms , and the edge forms are those that lie on the extreme rays .",
    "l - type domains have been first introduced and studied by voronoi , and they play a central role in his classification theory for lattices , his theory of lattice types .",
    "delaunay associated these polyhedral cones with delaunay tilings .",
    "prior to the discovery of the sequence @xmath48 of @xmath9-topes by erdahl and rybnikov in 2001 only finitely many arithmetic types of edge forms of _ full rank _ were known .",
    "all of the infinite sequences of perfect delaunay polytopes that we report on correspond to infinite sequences of edge forms of full rank for l - type domains . later infinite series of perfect delaunay polytopes were constructed by dutour ( 2005 ) and grishukhin ( 2006 ) .",
    "our multiparametric series overlap with the 1-parametric series of dutour only in small dimensions ( 6,7,8 ) .",
    "our series contain all of the series of grishukhin , although his approach is different .",
    "the remarkable property of dutour s series is that the size of the vertex set of dutour s polytope grows exponentially with the dimension , for his @xmath1-polytope @xmath49 , for even @xmath1 s , contains a section isometric to the @xmath50-halfcube ( for odd @xmath1 s it has 2 sections isometric to the @xmath51-halfcube ) .",
    "dutour conjectured that this polytope @xmath49 has the largest number of vertices among all perfect delaunay polytopes of dimension @xmath1 .",
    "+ perfect delaunay polytopes , and the infinite cylinders with perfect delaunay polytopes as bases , also provide labels for _ edge functions _ for the _ inhomogeneous domains _ of delaunay polytopes . associated with each lattice delaunay polytope",
    "is a polyhedral cone of inhomogeneous quadratic functions , and we refer to the functions lying on extreme rays as edge functions .",
    "these domains play an important role in the structure theory of delaunay polytopes .",
    "delaunay tilings of lattices and voronoi s theory of l - types are intrinsically connected to the theory of moduli spaces of abelian varieties . on a philosophical level",
    "this connection stems from the idea of parametric approach to the study of geometric objects . in geometry of numbers and number",
    "theory this approach was pioneered by hermite ( 1850 ) .",
    "korkine , zolotareff , and voronoi referred to this approach as hermite s method of continuous variation of parameters .",
    "it is worth noting that voronoi s interest in geometry of numbers developed as a result of his work on irrationalities of the third degrees and , in particular , elliptic curves .",
    "the curous reader may consult delone [ delaunay ] and faddeev ( 1964 ) .",
    "for recently discovered connections between moduli spaces of abelian varieties and voronoi s theories of perfect and of l - types see alexeev ( 2002 ) and shepard - barron ( 2005 ) .",
    "we are not aware for any results interpreting perfect perfect delaunay polytopes and l - types defined by them , but we certainly anticipate them .",
    "+ the following section is devoted to the details of how perfect delaunay polytopes relate to these fundamental polyhedral cones in geometry of numbers , the homogeneous domain of a delaunay tiling , and the inhomogeneous domain of a delaunay polytope .",
    "* historical notes : * perfect delaunay polytopes were first considered by erdahl ( 1975 ) in connection with lattice polytopes arising from the quantum mechanics of many electrons .",
    "he observed ( 1975 ) that delaunay tilings of 0- and 1-dimensional lattices consist entirely of perfect delaunay polytopes , and showed that the gosset polytope @xmath52 with 27 vertices was a perfect delaunay polytope in the root lattice @xmath24 .",
    "he also showed that there were no perfect delaunay polytopes in dimensions 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "these results were further extended by erdahl ( 1992 ) by showing that the 7-dimensional gosset polytope @xmath20 with 56 vertices is perfect , and that there are no perfect delaunay polytopes of dimension @xmath1 for @xmath53 .",
    "erdahl also proved that @xmath9 and @xmath15 are the only perfect delaunay polytopes in the delaunay tilings for the root lattices .",
    "deza , grishukhin , and laurent ( 1992 - 1997 , in various combinations ) found more examples of perfect delaunay polytopes in dimensions 15 , 16 , 22 , and 23 , but all of those seemed to be sporadic .",
    "the first construction of infinite sequences of perfect delaunay polytopes was described at the conference dedicated to the seventieth birthday of sergei ryshkov ( erdahl , 2001 ) , and later reported by rybnikov ( 2001 ) and erdahl and rybnikov ( 2002 ) .",
    "perfect delaunay polytopes have been classified up to dimension 7  dutour ( 2004 ) proved that @xmath52 is the only perfect polytope for @xmath54 .",
    "it is strongly suspected that the existing lists of seven and eight dimensional perfect delaunay polytopes are complete ( see http://www.liga.ens.fr/~dutour ) .",
    "perfect delaunay polytopes play an important role in the _ l - type reduction theory of voronoi and delaunay _ for positive ( homogeneous ) quadratic forms .",
    "an l - type domain is the collection of all possible positive quadratic forms that give the same delaunay tiling @xmath55 for @xmath4 .",
    "l - type domains are relatively open polyhedral cones , with boundary cells that are also l - type domains  these conical cells fit together to tile the cone of positive quadratic forms , which is described in the next section in detail .",
    "simplicial delaunay tilings label the full dimensional conic \" tiles  , and all other possible delaunay tilings label the lower dimensional cones .",
    "the significance of extreme l - types is much due to their relation to the structure of delaunay and voronoi tilings for lattices .",
    "the delaunay tilings that correspond to edge forms play an important role :  _ the delaunay tiling for an l - type domain is the intersection of the delaunay tilings for edge forms for the l - type _ ( erdahl , 2000 ) .",
    "there is a corresponding dual statement on the structure of voronoi polytopes : _ the voronoi polytope _ @xmath56 _ _  for a form _",
    "_ @xmath57 _ _  contained in an l - type domain @xmath58 is a weighted minkowski sum of linear transforms of voronoi polytopes for each of the edge forms of @xmath58 . _",
    "_   the latter dual result was first established by h .- f .",
    "loesch in his 1990 doctoral dissertation , although it was first published by ryshkov ( 1998 , 1999 ) , who independently rediscovered loesch s theorem ; this dual result was given a shorter and simpler proof by erdahl ( 2000 ) .",
    "edge forms that are interior to the cone of positive forms are rare in low dimensions .",
    "they first occur in dimension 4 : @xmath59 has an extreme @xmath60-type . a good proportion , but not all , of the edge forms appearing in lower dimensions relate either directly or indirectly to perfect delaunay polytopes .",
    "as shown by dutour and vallentin ( 2005 ) this situation does not persist in higher dimensions : there is an  explosion \" of the number of inequivalent interior edge forms in six dimensions , and only a tiny fraction of these are inherited from perfect delaunay polytopes .",
    "the voronoi and delaunay tilings for point lattices are constructed using the euclidean metric , but are most effectively studied by injectively mapping the lattice into @xmath4 , and replacing the euclidean metric by an equivalent metrical form .  for a @xmath1-dimensional point lattice @xmath61 with a basis @xmath62 this",
    "is done as follows .",

    "the squared euclidean length is given by @xmath68 .",
    "this squared length can equally well be interpreted as the squared length of the integer vector @xmath69 relative to the form @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the dirichlet - voronoi and delaunay tilings for @xmath71 , constructed using the euclidean metric , can be studied using the corresponding dirichlet - voronoi and delaunay tilings for @xmath4 constructed using the form @xmath70 as metric .",
    "moreover , variation of the dirichlet - voronoi and delaunay tilings for @xmath72 in response to variation of the lattice basis can be studied by varying the metric @xmath57 for the fixed lattice @xmath4 . in this section",
