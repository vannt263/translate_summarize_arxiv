    "two clusterings of the data are clearly visible : objects with very small pd and a wide pa range over 180  are likely located in front of local dust clouds , while those with relatively large pds of typically @xmath29 and broadly similar pas of 030  are positioned beyond the dust clouds .",
    "we note that the slightly greater pd of v404  cyg  ( @xmath30 ) with respect to the surrounding objects ( @xmath29 ) implies a small level of intrinsic polarization for v404  cyg  of at most a few percent .",
    "furthermore , we show the @xmath31-band pds and pas of v404  cyg  in fig .",
    "[ fig : multiband ] indicating a steep pd decrease toward longer wavelengths with constant pas over the six observation bands .",

    "we consider the measured polarization of v404  cyg  is predominantly contaminated by interstellar dust between the object and the earth .",
    "the low intrinsic pd ( less than a few percent ) implies that the optical and nir emissions are dominated by either disk or optically - thick synchrotron emission , or both .",
    "the simultaneous _ kanata_/honir @xmath0- and @xmath1-band light curves showed almost the same temporal evolution , except the orphan @xmath1-band flare which peaked around mjd  57193.54 and lasted for @xmath2  mins ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lc ] ) . apart from this orphan flare ( which is discussed in detail later )",
    ", the quite similar @xmath0- and @xmath1-band light curves naturally leads to an interpretation that the nir and optical emissions come from the same component ( or have the same origin ) .",
    "there are two possible options to explain the optical and nir emissions : one is a disk origin and the other is from a jet . to gauge which is the most plausible , we constructed a broadband spectrum of v404  cyg  from the radio to x - ray bands in @xmath32-@xmath33 representation ( fig.[fig : fnu ] ) .",
    "note that the radio fluxes are not simultaneous , while the _ kanata _  and _ swift_/xrt data were obtained within a one - hour timespan .",
    "the _ kanata _  optical and nir fluxes were dereddened by assuming @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",

    "after we corrected the observed fluxes for extinction using @xmath34 , we found a slightly rising , but almost flat ( @xmath38 ) shape in the optical and nir spectrum .",
    "this implies optically - thick synchrotron emission from an outer jet .",
    "indeed , the @xmath39  ghz radio spectrum obtained about 1.5  days before our observation ( on mjd  57191.95 ) can be smoothly extrapolated to the _",
    "kanata_/honir spectral data assuming a @xmath40 form ( see fig  [ fig : fnu ] )",
    ". however , the flat optical / nir spectral shape can also be interpreted in a disk model ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* extended data figure  6 therein ) .",
    "thus , it is difficult to determine the optical / nir emission mechanism solely from its spectral shape .",
    "no evidence of intrinsic linear polarization in the @xmath0- and @xmath1-bands are allowed in both scenarios because both optically - thick synchrotron and blackbody radiation only generate weak linear polarization of order @xmath41% .    here , we focus on the orphan @xmath1-band flare which lasted for only @xmath2 mins at mjd  57193.54 .",
    "the observed red color and short duration imply synchrotron emission from a jet as the most plausible origin of the flare .",
    "indeed , the @xmath1-band peak flux of the flare reached @xmath27  jy , which was the same level measured during the giant radio and sub - mm flares observed by ratan-600 and sub millimeter array on mjd  57198.933 and mjd  57195.55 @xcite , respectively .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fnu ] ( _ left _ panel ) , an extrapolation of the radio spectrum observed during the giant flare at ghz - frequencies on mjd  57198.933 nicely connects to the @xmath1-band peak flux by assuming a flat spectral shape ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) .",
    "more interestingly , even during the orphan flare , the @xmath1-band pd remains showed no significant temporal variation , indicating the nir emission is not strongly polarized .",
    "this result would be reasonably understood if the jet synchrotron emission in the @xmath1 band is still in the optically - thick regime .",
    "we therefore conjecture that this orphan @xmath1-band flare is produced by optically - thick synchrotron emission from an outer jet .",
    "if the optically - thick synchrotron emission extends up to the @xmath0-band with a flat spectral shape and the baseline @xmath0-band flux is not as high as the flaring component of @xmath27  jy ( after extinction correction , assuming @xmath34 ) , it significantly contributes to the @xmath0-band flux as well , making the flare visible also in the @xmath0-band light curve .",
    "a spectral break between the @xmath1 and @xmath0 bands of the flaring emission component caused by the transition of synchrotron emission from optically - thick to optically - thin regimes , if present , would make the contribution of the flaring component negligible with respect to the baseline flux , as observed .",

    "to constrain the jet parameters and physical quantities in the emission region , we attempted to model the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of v404  cyg  by using a one - zone synchrotron plus synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model @xcite , which is widely used for blazar sed modeling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "hence , the optically - thick synchrotron emission from an outer jet , which has a flat spectrum of @xmath43 observed in the radio up to nir band is not modeled , while the optically - thin synchrotron and ssc emissions at optical frequencies and higher are fitted .",
    "however , in the current case , we now know that the optical and x - ray emission are from a disk and disk plus corona , respectively . we therefore regard the _",
    "kanata_/honir , _",
    "swift_/xrt , and _ integral _  data points ( taken from fig .  3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as upper limits for the jet emission .",
    "another constraint comes from the _ kanata_/honir observation that the @xmath1-band emission is not significantly polarized even during the orphan flare .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath1-band emission is still in the optically - thick regime and that the break frequency ( defined as @xmath44 ) is due to synchrotron self absorption ( ssa ) .",
    "the transition from the optically - thick to optically - thin regime is above the @xmath1-frequency band , thus @xmath45  hz , and we adopt a value of @xmath46  hz .",

    "note that the electron power - law index of 2.2 we obtained from sed modeling has already been modified by rapid synchrotron and ssc cooling . in the current situation , because the magnetic field is strong ( @xmath77  g ) and emission region is small ( @xmath78  cm ) , we need to consider the following three energy loss processes : adiabatic cooling ( this is also equivalent to particle escape from emission region ) , synchrotron cooling , and ssc cooling .",

    "the jet power in electrons ( @xmath86 ) and magnetic field ( @xmath87 ) is calculated as @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the electron energy density , @xmath90 is assumed , and the factor of 2 is due to the assumption of a two - sided jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we obtained the same parameter values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the electron energy distribution , but the electron normalization @xmath113 is smaller due to the fainter jet flux , as was observed in the radio band .",
    "we also found @xmath114 , suggesting again the jet is slightly poynting - flux dominated .",
    "more interestingly , the total radiated power is again larger than the summed electron and magnetic field powers in the jet ( see table  [ tab : model ] ) , implying the presence of a baryonic component even during the fainter state .      1 .",
    "the ssa frequency and peak flux density enable us to estimate the magnetic field strength and size of the emission region by assuming equipartition between magnetic field and relativistic electrons .",
    "the derived magnetic field of @xmath115  gauss is much stronger , and size of the emission region of @xmath116  cm much smaller , compared to agn jets ( typically @xmath117  gauss and @xmath118  cm , see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "based on modeling of the broadband spectrum of v404  cyg , we found an upper limit to the cutoff lorentz factor of electrons of @xmath112 .",
    "because the cutoff is determined by the balance of the acceleration and cooling times , this result implies a longer acceleration time of @xmath73 in this microquasar jet , suggesting electron acceleration is much less efficient compared to agn jets ( that typically show @xmath76 ) .",

    "electrons are assumed to have a broken power - law shape .",
    "the power - law index below the break lorentz factor @xmath120 ( typically @xmath121 ) is estimated as @xmath122 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , @xmath119 derived here in v404  cyg  jet is comparable to that derived in agn jets , implying that same acceleration mechanism operates in these different systems .",
