    "his model is based on concepts of the theory of algorithmic information and randomness .",
    "he modeled a solid as a selection rule of a finite algorithmic complexity which acts on an incoming random sequence of particles in the surroundings .",
    "this selection mechanism is intrinsically connected to the solid s complex non - linear structure ( partly a consequence of its internal atomic vibrations ) and its intricate time - response to external stimulus . as postulated in @xcite ,",

    "the solid s stability over time is explained in @xcite by using the stochastic property of the frequency stability of a random sequence .",
    "accordingly , the physical stability of the system ( solid ) is intrinsically and inversely proportional to the ability of the solid to deform ( or distort ) the input sequence and make it less random , i.e. , more random - deficient .",
