    "any liquid , when cooled sufficiently fast , turns into a glass : a peculiar state of matter , disordered like a liquid , yet rigid like a solid @xcite .",
    "black hole horizons behave like perfect fluids @xcite and have been used extensively to holographically model liquid states of matter @xcite .",
    "it is natural to hypothesize that such holographic liquids will similarly vitrify upon rapid cooling .",
    "but what , then , is a holographic glass ? this is is the question we want to address here .",
    "in fact , even disregarding interpretations in terms of black holes and holography , the nature of glass and the glass transition remains shrouded in mystery @xcite . over a century of theoretical , experimental and numerical research have led to many new insights , but so far no fully successful grand unified theory of the glass transition has emerged .",
    "the central question in the field is what causes the dynamical arrest that occurs when a supercooled liquid approaches its glass transition temperature , signaled by an explosive growth in relaxation time scales , leading for example to a dramatic increase in shear viscosity .",
    "this happens without any discernible change in spatial structure or order compared to the liquid phase .",
    "one of the diverging points of view in the field is whether the transition is essentially thermodynamic or kinetic in nature .",
    "what is known is that in any case , the glass transition is not described by equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "glasses are thermodynamically metastable states failing to find their way to true equilibrium on experimental time scales . as a result ,",
    "their properties depend on the details of their history , in particular on their age , that is to say on how long it has been since they fell out of equilibrium .",
    "this often manifests itself in universal `` aging '' behavior of observables .",
    "a concrete example of this is the aging of the conductivity @xmath8 of electron glasses , which when measured at different times decreases as @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "notice that instead of the usual time translation invariance of exponential relaxation ( e.g.  discharge of a capacitor ) , we now get time _ scale _ invariance .",
    "non - exponential relaxation laws have been observed for many other amorphous systems , apparently going back at least to weber , who noticed it in the relaxation of the silk threads he used to hang his magnets @xcite .",
    "a qualitative picture for how these and other features may come about is that glasses have extremely rugged free energy landscapes , with exponentially many local minima , in which the system gets hopelessly lost in its attempts to find the true global minimum .",
    "it has been known for a long time that this picture can be given a precise meaning in mean field models of spin glasses @xcite , in which the equations determining local magnetization densities ( the so - called tap equations @xcite ) have exponentially many solutions below the spin glass transition temperature .",
    "this is in contrast to the analogous mean field equations for the ising model , which below the critical temperature has just two solutions for the magnetization density , corresponding to the homogeneous spin up / down equilibrium states .",
    "the degrees of freedom governed by tap - like equations are local order parameters , coarser than the fundamental microscopic degrees of freedom , but finer than the global thermodynamic variables .",
    "they have definite expectation values in particular , metastable , macroscopically distinguished states , with small thermal fluctuations around these expectation values .",
    "this is analogous to classical backgrounds in field or string theory . indeed string theory",
    "likewise exhibits an exponentially large landscape of solutions , the `` vacua '' of the theory .",
    "various incarnations of the landscape - based , essentially static thermodynamic approach , adapted to structural glasses the standard terminology in the glass literature is that spin glass models are models with quenched disorder ( hamiltonians with randomly frozen couplings ) , while structural glass models start from simple hamiltonians ( e.g.  lennard - jones ) , the disorder being spontaneously generated .",
    "the systems studied in this work are analogous to structural glasses , existing without any quenched disorder . ]",
    "have been the leading theories of the glass transition for many years @xcite .",
    "more recently however , there has been a renewed focus on real space - time dynamical properties , as opposed to static configuration space properties , due to a large extent to the observation , in experiments and especially numerical simulations , of the ubiquitousness and importance of `` dynamical heterogeneities '' . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "one of the striking features of the glass transition is the complete absence of _ static _ structural changes accompanying it .",
    "the new insight is that this is not true for _ dynamic _ structural changes .",
    "supercooled liquids turn out to have long - lived , localized regions of high cooperative dynamic activity , mixed with localized regions of almost no cooperative motion whatsoever .",
    "the size , distribution and evolution of these structures changes significantly when approaching the glass transition .",
    "these remarkable kinetic features are hard to explain in the essentially static landscape - based theories , and theories giving a central role to spacetime trajectories have gained some prominence as a result @xcite .",
    "neither of these different classes of theories is fully satisfactory however , and getting the theories in line with observations often requires patching together elements from different approaches , which are not always logically consistent with each other .",
    "there is no universal framework analogous to the framework statistical mechanics provides for equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "one of the theoretical obstacles making this such a challenging problem is the lack of models that retain all the basic features of a structural glass while also remaining analytically tractable .",
    "there is at this point nothing like the hydrogen atom or the ising model for the glass transition .      a good model for the glass transition",
    "ideally should be able to quantitatively capture the strongly coupled physics of a liquid at all temperatures , allowing analytic study of thermodynamic and transport properties as well as real time relaxation dynamics , making the emergence of dynamical arrest and the salient features of glass formation manifest .",
    "holographic models would therefore seem to be the perfect candidates , as they provide exact solutions to thermodynamic questions ( at least for certain large @xmath10 field theories ) , and have proven to be particularly powerful exactly in modeling liquid phases of matter and their transport properties , at arbitrary temperatures .",
    "moreover , holography provides direct access to the complete thermodynamic state space , including the landscape of macroscopically distinct stable and metastable states , giving the latter a precise meaning . in other words",
    ", it provides a precise analog to the tap equations mentioned above , in the universal form of the bulk gravity field equations .",
    "explicit solutions can be constructed and probed at will , aided by geometric intuition .",
    "the relevant local order parameters are manifest , and it becomes possible to directly deduce whether or not a thermodynamic free energy landscape emerges , and if so what its physical consequences are .",
    "in addition , holography automatically incorporates spacetime dynamics , no matter if we are near or far from equilibrium .",
    "this makes it possible to study within the same local but macroscopic framework also relaxation dynamics , aging , dynamical heterogeneities and other kinetic features , without having to go back to the microscopic details .",
    "thus , it appears holography would be an ideal platform for theoretical work towards a unified theory of the glass transition .",
    "this brings us back to our question : what , then , is a holographic glass ?",
    "as mentioned before , a black hole or black brane in ads behaves as a holographic liquid .",
    "famously , the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath11 has the universal value @xmath12 for any thermodynamic state dual to a black brane at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the entropy density @xmath13 goes down with temperature , so for holographic liquids described by black branes , the shear viscosity @xmath14 will decrease with decreasing temperature .",
    "in contrast , for ordinary liquids such as water , the shear viscosity goes _ up _ when temperature goes down , dramatically so in the supercooled regime , effectively diverging when approaching the glass transition .",
    "thus a simple homogenous black brane will never behave like a supercooled liquid , let alone a glass .",
    "the holographic dual of a glass should therefore break the translation invariant , homogeneous nature of the black brane .",
    "it is known that in certain circumstances , homogeneous bulk geometries such as black branes may indeed become unstable to formation of inhomogeneities @xcite , sometimes giving rise to mildly spatially modulated , `` striped '' phases , vortex lattices or other inhomogeneous structures @xcite .",
    "these are distinct from holographic lattices that are quenched into the geometry by applying a modulated source on the boundary of ads such as those studied in @xcite , in the sense that they are spontaneously generated , in the absence of explicit inhomogeneous sources .",
    "the works cited above exhibit holographic geometries with lattice - like , periodic order . not surprisingly , they have crystal - like properties , rather than glass - like .",
    "one would expect a glassy geometry to be disordered .",
    "disordered holographic geometries have been studied too @xcite , but as far as we know , all examples studied to date are quenched by explicit sources .",
    "thus , in the terminology of footnote [ spinvsstructural ] , they describe holographic `` spin '' ( quenched ) glasses , rather than holographic structural ( spontaneous ) glasses . what we are after are holographic structural glasses , with the disordered geometry generated in the absence of explicit disordered boundary sources .",
    "it is possible that in the models of spontaneous breaking of translation symmetry cited above , disordered brane geometries might exist besides the ordered ones studied so far , the reason for the occurrence of order and lattice symmetry being more related to the relative simplicity of constructing symmetric geometries , rather than being intrinsic . indeed ,",
    "finding metastable disordered geometries would require finding isolated disordered solutions to a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations , arguably not an easy task . to construct simpler examples of disordered geometries in the absence of disordered sources",
    ", one might want to try to sprinkle charged massive probe particles onto a charged black brane background . in the dual cft , this would correspond to adding small matter density inhomogeneities .",
    "however , just dropping a charged particle onto a black brane horizon will not generate a metastable structure , as the charge will quickly dissolve into the horizon .",
    "more fundamentally , whether we treat the problem perturbatively or use the fully nonlinear einstein equations , we are still left with a single , smooth brane horizon , and it is not clear ( to us at least ) if local inhomogeneities are enough to destroy universal properties such as @xmath15 , which as we have seen is incompatible with what one expects from a supercooled liquid or a glass .      in this paper , we explore a different idea , continuing on our work in @xcite .",
    "the idea is that glassy and supercooled liquid phases of matter are holographically dual to disordered geometries with fragmented horizons , or more precisely to metastable black hole bound states .",
    "a zoo of absolutely stable , supersymmetric , stationary black hole bound states has been known in the context of 4d @xmath16 supergravity for some time @xcite , and the bound states we will study in this paper are cousins thereof , lifted to finite temperature and to asymptotically ads@xmath17 space .",
    "the generalization to finite temperature , asymptotically flat bound states was the subject of @xcite ( and independently @xcite ) , where existence of such bound states was established by considering charged probe black holes in the presence of a nonextremal background black hole . in this work",
    "we show that such bound states persist for nonextremal charged black holes in ads@xmath17 , including planar ones .",
    "the specific bulk gravity theory we consider is the simplest possible natural uplift of the asymptotically flat model studied in @xcite to ads@xmath17 .",
    "it is given by four - dimensional einstein gravity coupled to two @xmath18 gauge fields and a non - minimally coupled scalar , with a scalar potential of `` fayet - iliopoulos '' gauged supergravity form @xcite , which appears naturally in flux compactifications of string theory .",
    "the scalar potential has a negative energy extremum , leading to ads@xmath17 vacuum solutions , and the model has the virtue of having known explicit nonextremal black hole solutions with running scalars , a prerequisite for constructing bound states generalizing those of @xcite .",
    "the probe particles are characterized by two electric and two magnetic charges , and crucially the existence of stationary bound states requires the charges of probe and background to be mutually nonlocal ( i.e.  in a duality frame in which the background is considered electric , the magnetic charge of the probes must be nonzero in order for a bound state to exist ) . as a result the bound particles",
    "are dynamically trapped by the black hole background , the way electrons get trapped in a magnetic background .    at sufficiently high temperature ,",
    "the bound states disappear , melting away into the background . at sufficiently low temperatures ,",
    "the expulsion of particles from the mother black hole to form bound states lowers the free energy and thus becomes thermodynamically favored .",
    "however , at equilibrium , the rates for emission and absorption of charges are exponentially small in the semiclassical ( @xmath19 ) limit in which the bulk gravity picture becomes reliable , leading to a distribution of exponentially large relaxation time scales @xmath20 with @xmath21 broadly distributed .",
    "as we will demonstrate , this naturally leads to aging , with a logarithmic aging law of the type mentioned above .",
    "a number of glassy features of these bound states is evident .",
    "a rugged free energy landscape with an extensive configurational entropy is manifest as the space of stationary bound state configurations .",
    "this space is large as a result of the fact that the constituents can have a wide range of different possible charges , with frustrated van der waals type static and electron - monopole type magnetic interactions between them . in the language of @xcite , still in the probe approximation",
    ", we can think of the local minima in this landscape as equilibrium configurations of `` supergoop '' clouds surrounding the mother black hole .",
    "examples are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fields ] and further on in [ fig : holes ] .",
    "although it may well be that there exists one particular ordered cloud configuration minimizing the free energy , there is no straight path that takes the system there starting from say the bare black brane state . indeed , as we will see , even disregarding interactions between probes , it is in general not true that transitions towards lower free energy states are faster ; in fact for a range of charges the opposite is true , with time scales for transitions to the lowest free energy bound states being exponentially much longer than those to higher free energy states . as a result ,",
    "the system gets trapped in valleys of the free energy landscape which do not continue down to the true lowest free energy states . in this regime ( the regime in which bound states are thermodynamically preferred over the bare brane ) , the probe density will eventually increase to the point that we necessarily exit the range of validity of the probe approximation . at higher temperatures ,",
    "all bound states have higher free energy than the bare brane , and are thus metastable . in this case",
    ", time evolution preserves the validity of the probe approximation , and we can follow the evolution of the system for arbitrarily long times . for example , after quenching some initial cloud configuration with order 1 occupation numbers , we can see how it relaxes back to the bare brane configuration with an exponentially dilute cloud , which is the equilibrium state . as already mentioned , we observe characteristic @xmath22 aging behavior for such relaxation processes , similar to aging laws in other amorphous systems .",
    "the main goals of this paper are to establish the existence of ads black hole bound states at finite temperature , to map out their detailed phase diagram , and to exhibit quantitatively the crude glassy features we just sketched .",
    "in addition , we set up the basic holographic dictionary between black hole bound states and their cft dual thermal states .",
    "in particular we determine the features to which the localized bulk probe particles map in the boundary cft  for instance localized electric charge maps to a localized excess of matter density given by the normal component of the electric field strength at the boundary , while localized magnetic charge maps to a localized current loop ( or spin ) given by the cross product of the unit normal and the magnetic field at the boundary .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields of some probes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fields ] and cft charge and current densities are illustrated for actual examples in figures [ fig : vortices ] , [ fig : densplots ] and [ fig : densplots2 ] .",
    "to understand the glass transition itself in this context , to extract detailed transport properties and to place these models in the larger framework of theories of supercooled liquids and the glass transition , more work will be needed . in the final section of this paper ,",
    "we give a detailed discussion of the gaps in our present analysis , offering some speculation and the general outlook we have on further progress . in a nutshell ,",
    "our current speculative view is as follows .",
    "bound states get highly populated during a cooling quench via classical horizon charge clumping instabilities , thus generating a finite density of local structures that are not in equilibrium but nevertheless metastable with exponentially long lifetimes .",
    "the bound charges backreact onto the brane , and because they are necessarily magnetically charged , they will act as magnetic brakes onto charged horizon currents , generating eddy current friction due to lenz s law .",
    "this will obstruct charge transport , leading to a dramatic decrease in diffusion rates .",
    "shear viscosity on the other hand , which is transversal momentum conductivity , will get greatly enhanced with respect to the bare black brane , as momentum can now efficiently be conducted through the supergoop cloud covering the brane . indeed , due to the mutual electric - magnetic nonlocality of the charges in the cloud , implying that pairs of charges produce an intrinsic angular momentum stored in their electromagnetic field , the cloud can be thought of as a network of gyroscopes , resisting shearing and dynamically rigidifying the system , for any one of its configurations . as a result",
    ", the viscosity will greatly increase .",
    "finally , dynamical heterogeneities are seeded by the bound charges , and their hierarchical dynamics as observed in simulations such as @xcite finds a natural geometrization in terms of the hierarchy of layers of particles bound at different radii .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ setup ]",
    "we introduce the model . in section [ sec : solution ] we review the bulk background solutions we will use , and settle on a convenient parametrization . in section [ sec : stability ]",
    "we discuss in detail the thermodynamic phase diagram of the background black holes , including the identification of possible charge clumping instabilities .",
    "we also study the small and planar black hole limits , and hyperscaling - violating limits . in section [ hhads ]",
    "we exhibit the existence of probe bound states and map out their phase diagram .",
    "we give special attention to the planar case , and briefly discuss the opposite limit , `` ads supergoop '' , which is a possible endstate in which the horizon has completely fragmented into small black holes .",
    "in [ sec : relaxationdynamics ] we study the relaxation dynamics of probe clouds in the ideal gas approximation , demonstrating the appearance of logarithmic aging and relating the aging coefficients to barrier distributions . in section [ sec : holointerpret ] we give the holographic interpretation of our bulk constructions .",
    "finally in section [ outlook ] we summarize our conclusions , point out the gaps in our analysis , provide some speculations and give an outlook on future directions .",
    "the appendices provide details of some results which may be of independent interest .",
    "the bulk gravity theory we consider consists of four - dimensional einstein gravity coupled to two @xmath18 gauge fields and a non - minimally coupled scalar . in addition it has a scalar potential with an ads@xmath17 vacuum solution , with tunable parameters controlling the scalar vev and the ads curvature scale .",
    "the specific lagrangian we start from is given below in ( [ modellag ] ) and the part we will actually use in this paper is given in ( [ modellagsimple ] ) .",
    "it can be viewed as a bosonic truncation of the simplest possible @xmath16 gauged supergravity theory , sometimes called fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) gauged supergravity @xcite ( for a concise review with black holes in mind see @xcite ) .    in the flat space limit ( vanishing scalar potential )",
    ", the model reduces to the one considered in @xcite , which was obtained there as a universal consistent truncation of any calabi - yau compactification of type iia string theory .",
    "one motivation for our choice of model is that this flat space limit is known to have stationary bps black hole bound states of arbitrary complexity @xcite , which persist at finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "hence by continuity we are guaranteed that black hole bound states will also exist in the present model , at least in the limit in which the size of the black holes is much smaller than the ads radius .",
    "another motivation is that the asymptotically flat background black hole solutions used in @xcite have explicit asymptotically ads counterparts @xcite .",
    "this allows us to copy the probe strategy followed in @xcite , making manifest the specific new features induced by the lift to ads@xmath17 .",
    "the final motivation is the plausibility that this model has a suitable ( stable ) embedding in string theory , possibly with a holographic dual description as a three - dimensional conformal field theory .",
    "the string theory embedding will have at least one important imprint on the low energy physics which is not determined by the 4d bulk lagrangian ( [ modellag ] ) itself , namely the spectrum of charged particles . to stay as close as possible to @xcite",
    ", we will assume the charged particles in the model are all much heavier than the ads curvature scale .",
    "this allows treating them as well - localized probes . as detailed in section [ sec : probeaction ] below , we will infer their mass by thinking of them as black holes much smaller than any of the length scales of the background .",

    "it leads to the following potential : @xmath38 in the context of flux compactifications , the constants @xmath39 and @xmath40 would be fixed by the choice of fluxes supporting the compactification , and by values of moduli we are taking to be frozen here .",
    "we will take @xmath41 to be arbitrarily tunable but fixed real valued parameters of the theory .",
    "if they have the same sign , which we assume from now on , the potential is extremized at a negative local maximum @xmath42 , giving rise to an ads@xmath17 vacuum with ads length @xmath43 , with @xmath44 in this vacuum the scalar has the conformally coupled value @xmath45 , above the breitenlohner - freedman ads tachyon bound @xcite , which for ads@xmath17 is @xmath46 .",
    "for the background black hole solutions which we consider , it is consistent to put @xmath47 , in which case the coupling matrix @xmath48 becomes diagonal and the theta angle matrix @xmath49 is zero .",

    "further down we will see that other quantities such as particle mass spectra have abjm - like scalings with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    however , the model we are considering is _ not _ the low energy effective action of the abjm ads@xmath57 compactification , as in this theory one of the @xmath18s is actually massive , higgsed by a charged scalar ( the universal 4d axion ) with d0- and d4- charges proportional to @xmath62 @xcite .",

    ". we will consider probe black holes which are much smaller than the ads radius as well as much smaller than the background black hole , albeit at the same temperature .",
    "as argued in @xcite and as we will check again in section [ sec : probevalidity ] below , in this limit , the background becomes effectively cold from the point of view of the probe , in the sense that the thermal contribution to its mass becomes negligible .",
    "hence the probe acquires the properties of an extremal black hole in asymptotically flat space .",
    "extremal asymptotically flat black holes in @xmath16 supergravity may be bps or non - bps . in the first case ,",
    "their mass is given by the absolute value of the central charge of the asymptotically flat @xmath16 supersymmetry algebra , which for our model is @xmath74 in the second case , the mass is strictly greater than this . as in @xcite , we restrict ourselves to probe charges that are in fact bps . besides being the simplest to analyze systematically , bps probes are also the most stable .",
    "although non strictly supersymmetric in ads , the phase space for decay of these nearly - bps probes will generically be much smaller than for probe charges which have a non - bps flat space limit .",

    "however if we send @xmath191 then for @xmath192 : @xmath193 this is a hyperscaling violating geometry with @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",

    "notice that the above metric ( [ hsp1 ] ) is conformal to ads@xmath200 .",
    "these geometries were studied in the context of the @xmath201 truncation of @xmath202 gauged supergravity in @xcite .",
    "to see what this limit corresponds to in our phase diagram , we use the various relations summarized in the previous section , obtaining @xmath203 and @xmath204 , and from this the charges @xmath205 and @xmath206 . notice that for these expressions to be real , and therefore the solution to be physical , @xmath151 must be bounded above for a given @xmath207 .",
    "specifically when @xmath191 , we need @xmath208 and when @xmath196 , we need @xmath209 .    thus , when @xmath196 ( metric ( [ hsp1 ] ) ) , we get @xmath210 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 , implying @xmath213 while @xmath183 remains finite and tunable to any desired value satisfying @xmath214 .",

    "[ fig : planphasediag ] .",
    "the charge ratio in this limit is @xmath215 , that is the black hole becomes purely d4-charged in this limit .",
    "similarly , when @xmath191 , we get @xmath216 , while @xmath217 remains finite ; this is the boundary at infinity in fig .",
    "[ fig : planphasediag ] .",
    "the charge ratio is @xmath218 ; the black hole becomes purely d0-charged in this limit .    besides the @xmath196 solutions we just described , there are also regular @xmath219 solutions with @xmath140 and @xmath141 finite that have ads@xmath190 near - horizon geometries .",
    "their free energy is @xmath220 , whereas the free energy of the @xmath221 solution is @xmath222 .",
    "away from the boundary point @xmath223 , the latter is always lower than the former , so the hyperscaling - violating geometry is always thermodynamically preferred . at the boundary point ,",
    "the two solutions coincide .",
    "the entropy @xmath224 vanishes when @xmath221 or @xmath225 .",
    "hence we conclude that at @xmath219 , the system under study has vanishing entropy in its thermodynamically preferred state ; it does not suffer from the entropy anomaly typical for einstein - maxwell setups with scalar - independent couplings .",
    "the grand canonical ensemble has an instability for all values of the parameters , perturbative for some , nonperturbative for others , because at fixed temperature and potentials , the free grand canonical free energy @xmath226 is unbounded from below .",
    "the unbounded direction corresponds to infinite d0-charge density @xmath100 keeping the d4-charge density @xmath227 fixed .",
    "this limit can be reached e.g.  by letting @xmath228 with @xmath229 and @xmath230 . using ( [ planarextensive ] )",
    "this gives @xmath231 , @xmath232 , @xmath233 , @xmath234 , and ( dropping irrelevant numerical factors ) : @xmath235 for @xmath236 , this is unbounded below when @xmath237 .",
    "thus , once the d0-density is sufficiently large , the system will be able to lower its free energy without bound by sucking in d0-charge from the reservoir .",
    "the local ( wannabe ) equilibrium values of the temperature and potentials scale as @xmath238 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 .",
    "so we see that the local equilibrium chemical potential @xmath241 in fact _ decreases _ with @xmath100 , in other words we get a negative capacitance , hence the runaway instability . persists . ]    on the other hand , as suggested by ( [ fapproxlargeq0 ] ) and as can be checked more generally , for smaller values of @xmath100 , the free energy slope goes the other way , towards zero @xmath100 .",
    "so for sufficiently small values of @xmath100 , the instability is nonperturbative ; a free energy density barrier must be overcome before the runaway regime is reached .",
    "notice that for the d4-charge density there is no such instability .",
    "if we similarly take @xmath242 while keeping @xmath100 fixed ( which requires scaling @xmath243 and @xmath244 ) , we obtain @xmath245 , @xmath246 , so @xmath247 , which is bounded and stable . the crucial difference between the two",
    "is the asymptotic growth of the energy with the charge , which has an exponent @xmath248 for the d0 and @xmath249 for the d4 charge .    to have a physically more stable setup",
    ", we could therefore work for example at fixed temperature and fixed charges rather than at fixed temperature and fixed chemical potentials .",
    "this will eliminate the runaway charge transfer from the reservoir , but nevertheless there will be a remnant in the form of a clumping instability , i.e.  towards formation of inhomogeneities .",
    "this is because we can consider any finite subregion of our black brane horizon to be a system held at fixed potentials , with the remainder of the brane playing the role of reservoir .",
    "the d0-charge accumulation instability will now correspond to a thermodynamic instability towards accretion of d0-charge in the subregion .",
    "this can be seen more directly . at fixed temperature and fixed total brane charges ,",
    "the thermodynamically preferred equilibrium state is the state that minimizes the canonical free energy @xmath250 .",
    "this includes minimization over possible inhomogeneities in the charge and energy densities .",
    "now imagine concentrating a total amount of charge @xmath251 in some finite area @xmath252 , giving a charge density @xmath253 , and let us assume we are in the high d0-charge density regime described earlier . keeping the d4-charge density @xmath227 fixed , we thus obtain a region with a canonical free energy density @xmath254 . the contribution to the _ total _ free energy of this region",
    "is therefore @xmath255 , which becomes smaller when @xmath256 .",
    "it is thus thermodynamically favored to concentrate the charge @xmath251 into an ever smaller area @xmath256 , since in addition also the surrounding region will decrease its free energy in this way ( as it lowers its d0-charge density ) .",
    "thus , according to this simple - minded thermodynamic picture , the initially homogeneous d0-charge will tend to implode into point - like chunks .",
    "this analysis is of course rather crude .",
    "we have not taken into account possible quantum or stringy corrections , which become important in the singular limit under consideration , and may well regulate the singularities .",
    "we have not taken into account density gradient contributions to the energy , which would give rise to bubble wall tensions and may also regulate singularities .",
    "finally , even within these approximations , we have fixed by hand the d4-charge density , but in general this density will also run .",
    "this may lead for instance to a complete separation of charge , with pure d0-dots inside a pure d4-sea . in any case , to determine the true final state , a more detailed analysis is clearly in order , but this falls outside the scope of this paper .",
    "we now proceed to establish the existence of bound states of these black holes with suitably charged probes .",
    "the probes are assumed much heavier than the ads scale , and in particular they can be black holes themselves , as long as they are much smaller than the length scales set by the background solution .",
    "we compute the probe potentials from ( [ probeaction ] ) ; a local minimum indicates a bound state .",
    "we take the probe potential to be zero at the horizon , so negative / positive values of the potential energy indicate stable / metastable bound states . on the other hand , since the probes are massive , an escape to infinity would require an infinite amount of energy ; the global ads metric acts as a confining box .",
    "this is a significant difference with the asymptotically flat case studied in @xcite .",
    "most of our analysis is numerical .",
    "we provide some analytic results in the planar zero temperature limit in section [ sec : anal ] .",
    "consider a probe with ( d6,d4,d2,d0)-brane charge @xmath257 . in the spirit of section [ scalingsymm ]",
    "it will be convenient to introduce rescaled charges @xmath258 with @xmath259 an at this point arbitrary constant .",
    "this differs from the rescaling used for the background black hole charges ( [ rescaledext ] ) in that there is no factor of @xmath54 involved here ; in its place we now have @xmath259 , which we can think of as parametrizing the order of magnitude of the probe charges .",
    "we do this because we want to keep the quantized probe charges fixed and finite while taking the @xmath260 limit .",
    "notice that since charge is quantized in order 1 units in our conventions , the hatted probe charges are quantized in units given by the above scaling factors . at fixed finite @xmath77 ,",
    "these can be made arbitrarily small by taking @xmath259 large , making the rescaled charges effectively continuous .",
    "furthermore , ratios of probe to background charges , masses and length scales will involve the rescaled variables ( tilde - variables for the background , hatted variables for the probes ) and a universal overall factor @xmath261 .",
    "for example @xmath262 and , using ( [ dprobemasses ] ) , @xmath263 .",
    "the discussion in section [ sec : probeaction ] implies that for order 1 rescaled probe charges , the probe black hole entropy will be of order @xmath264 , hence the ratio of its linear size over the ads length scale will be of order @xmath265 .",
    "thus , for finite rescaled variables , the probe approximation will be justified provided @xmath266 .",
    "the static potential @xmath267 obtained from ( [ probeaction ] ) and the solutions described in section [ sec : msgp ] consists of two parts , a gravitational part @xmath268 and an electromagnetic part @xmath269 .",
    "explicitly @xmath270 with : @xmath271 } \\ , ~,\\ ] ] and @xmath272 where as before @xmath273 the radial coordinate @xmath274 vanishes at the horizon . in the above expressions , the background variables are understood to be rescaled as in section [ scalingsymm ] , but we have suppressed the tildes here .",
    "in contrast to the background metric and scalar , the probe potential is qualitatively altered when flipping the sign of @xmath100 or @xmath227 . because of this we have to consider both possible signs of @xmath275 separately .",
    "notice however that we still have the following symmetry : @xmath276 this allows us to assume @xmath277 without loss of generality .",
    "finally let us check the claim made in section [ sec : probeaction ] that from the probe point of view the background temperature is effectively zero .",
    "the fraction of the probe s energy that is thermal when it has the same temperature as the background is , for order 1 values of the rescaled variables , @xmath278 , so again if @xmath266 , the probe will effectively be extremal .    in what follows",
    "we will mostly drop the hats ( and tildes ) in our notation , which is equivalent to setting @xmath279 , @xmath280 , @xmath281 , @xmath282 . to restore the factors",
    "@xmath43 , @xmath10 , @xmath283 and @xmath259 in equations , one should keep in mind the following scaling weights : @xmath284=(1,0,-1,0)$ ] , @xmath285 = ( 0,1,0,0)$ ] , @xmath286 = ( 1,\\frac{1}{2},0,0)$ ] , @xmath287 = ( 0,\\frac{1}{2},0,1)$ ] .",
    "the first two entries correspond to the weights @xmath178 for background quantities given in section [ scalingsymm ] , the third one is the mass dimension , and the fourth one indicates nonzero only for quantities involving the probe ; it indicates the scaling with the overall size ( charge / mass ) of the probe .",
    "for example the weights of the probe potential are @xmath288=(0,0,-1,1)$ ] , hence @xmath289 .",
    "we will restore the original factors in the concluding sections .",
    "when a small probe charge is expelled from a black hole , the black hole entropy changes by an amount @xmath290 here we used the microcanonical definitions of temperature and chemical potentials , taking into account that the potentials for d2 and d6 charge are zero .",
    "conservation of charge implies @xmath291 and @xmath292 .",
    "conservation of energy implies @xmath293 , where @xmath294 is the sum of the probe s rest mass energy plus the binding energy due to the probe - black hole interaction .",
    "up to an additive constant @xmath295 this equals the natural total energy @xmath296 obtained from the probe action given in section [ sec : probeaction ] : @xmath297 where @xmath267 is the probe potential derived there , and @xmath298 is the probe kinetic energy .",
    "the additive constant @xmath295 is easily obtained by considering a probe at rest asymptotically far away from the black hole . in this case",
    "there is no binding energy so @xmath294 is just the probe s gravitational rest mass energy @xmath299 , defined in ( [ probepotdef ] ) .",
    "on the other hand in this situation we have @xmath300 , as can be seen from ( [ probepotdefel ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath301 .",
    "putting everything together , the constant term cancels with the other potential dependent terms in @xmath302 , leaving us with the simple result @xmath303 where @xmath304 . the change in the total microcanonical entropy of the system for a given final state @xmath305 of the probe viewed as a particle ( here @xmath306 is a one particle state label which includes charge and energy @xmath296 ) is thus @xmath307 where @xmath308 is the probe s internal entropy .",
    "recall that @xmath309 while @xmath310 , so in the probe limit @xmath266 , the probe s internal entropy contribution to @xmath311 is generically subleading .    in the planar limit it is also natural to take the system @xmath312 of interest to correspond to a finite ( but parametrically large ) part of the @xmath313-plane , with the remainder of the plane viewed as the reservoir .",
    "in this case , by definition , @xmath314 , and ( [ deltasnlm ] ) reduces to @xmath315 we can now take the system size to infinity , and view this as a formula for the change of total free energy in the grand canonical ensemble .    thus , in equilibrium , the probability of finding a single probe in a given state @xmath306 relative to the probability of having no probes is @xmath316 .",
    "in particular we see that if the minimum of the probe potential is negative , ejecting such probes is thermodynamically preferred at large @xmath10 , while if it is positive , swallowing them is preferred .",
    "if @xmath317 is positive for all possible probe charges , we get a cold , exponentially dilute gas in the large @xmath10 limit ( so interactions can be neglected ) , with average occupation number of the 1-particle state @xmath305 given by @xmath318 alternatively these occupation numbers can be obtained by considering the thermal atmosphere of the black hole as a statistical mechanical system in the grand canonical ensemble , with the black hole acting as a reservoir",
    ". we do not distinguish between bose or fermi statistics here because the gas is dilute ( the average occupation number is @xmath319 suppressed ) .    the average number of probe particles of a given charge @xmath320 is obtained ( still in the dilute gas approximation ) by summing this over all fixed charge 1-particle states , or semiclassically by integrating over the relevant phase space volume .",
    ", this phase space volume is actually infinite due to the infinite redshift .",
    "similarly , with dirichlet boundary conditions at the horizon , the naive sum over quantum states is infinite , for the same reasons . at the same time , and related to this , the dilute gas approximation breaks down near the horizon , since @xmath321 when @xmath322 .",
    "thus we can only make reliable statements for the average number of probes at separations larger than some ir cutoff @xmath323 .",

    "we will focus in particular on bound states with `` pure fluxed d6 '' probes  these are probes with charges @xmath329 defined by expanding @xmath330 , i.e. : @xmath331 in other words @xmath332 in the parametrization introduced at the end of section [ sec : probeaction ] .",
    "such probes can be thought of as wrapped d6-branes with worldvolume flux @xmath333 turned on , which lift to smooth , locally taub - nut `` bubbling '' geometries in m - theory @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this restriction is in part simplifying the search for bound states , and in part the observation made in @xcite that in the asymptotically flat case , at least in a large part of parameter space , these charges form bound states more easily than any other charge which has a single centered realization .",
    "numerical explorations in the present setup confirm this , although we do not investigate this exhaustively .    the search for bound states proceeds by looking for local minima of @xmath334 defined in equations  ( [ probepotdef ] ) and  ( [ probepotdefel ] ) , for all possible values of @xmath82 .",
    "this is done numerically .",
    "note that @xmath335 at the event horizon and therefore probe bound states with @xmath336 are thermodynamically favorable configurations as explained in section [ sec : thermointerpr ] .",

    "intuitively the reason is clear : when the temperature is increased , black holes gain mass rather than charge , the gravitational pull becomes stronger , and eventually gravitational collapse is inevitable  the probe is pulled into the black hole .",

    "these are probes bound to a black hole with negative free energy and are closer in nature to the bound state regions across the white gap than those across the dotted line .",

    "4 .   while the @xmath349 bound states generically disappear when crossing the lower dotted line from below , nothing analogous can be said for the @xmath341 bound states above the dotted line as we cross it from above . since nothing singular happens for the stable backgrounds as the lower dotted line is crossed , this matches with our expectations .",

    "note however that this is entirely due to the gravitational trapping effect of ads , the additional inter - particle interaction being now repulsive over the entire range of distances .",

    "however the considerations made in section [ sec : confwall ] , as well as more elementary considerations regarding the effective newtonian description of nonrelativistic particles confined to global ads , suggest the following simple modification of the static potential : @xmath426 where @xmath43 is the ads length and @xmath427 is the position of the @xmath428-th particle in isotropic coordinates .",

    "the dynamics has rather peculiar properties , with magnetic trapping , dynamical rigidity and precession drift being some of the more striking features .",
    "a key differences with the flat space system is that supersymmetry is broken . at the classical level one",
    "expects the high - dimensional moduli space to get lifted ; at the quantum level one expects similarly the lowest landau level to split up .",
    "in this section we initiate a study of the relaxation dynamics of metastable probe clouds .",
    "we will see that even when ignoring interactions between the probes , the system exhibits `` aging '' behavior typical for glasses .",
    "we begin by outlining the general ideas , and then apply this to our setup .      as observed in section [ sec : thermointerpr ] , to leading order in the probe approximation , the probe potential can be identified with the system s free energy relative to the probe being inside the black hole . in particular , bound states with @xmath430 are thermodynamically preferred and thus can be expected to be populated over time , while bound states with @xmath431 are metastable .",
    "however , transitions of probes in and out of the black hole will generically be exponentially slow at large @xmath54 .",

    "both exponents scale linearly with @xmath54 , hence transition rates will be exponentially suppressed at large @xmath54 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath21 in the transition rates @xmath436 depends on the charges of the probe and on the background parameters . as we will see , at large @xmath54 and @xmath283 , there is a parametrically large number of probe charges that form bound states , leading to a broad , quasi - continuous distribution of values for @xmath21 , and hence to a broad distribution of exponential time scales .      on general grounds , in such a situation , one may expect `` aging '' phenomena to occur , i.e.  the system exhibits age - dependent relaxation behavior which breaks time translation invariance but exhibits approximate scale invariance .",
    "more concretely this means the following .",
    "consider a system `` born '' at a time @xmath437 , and say we are interested in some observable @xmath438 .",
    "the system could for example be a glass sample produced by a rapid cooling quench at @xmath437 , and the observable @xmath438 its dielectric constant .",
    "for ordinary , non - aging systems , equilibrium will be reached on microscopic time - scales , after which @xmath438 will be constant , up to small fluctuations decaying exponentially on some characteristic microscopic time scale @xmath359 , independent of its age .",
    "in contrast , for an aging system , @xmath439 will forever evolve , and in addition obeys @xmath440 for some function @xmath131 .",
    "thus , there is no time translation invariance , but instead we have scale invariance : the relaxation behavior depends on the age of the system , with all relevant time scales growing in proportion to age .",
    "let us sketch the basic idea of how aging can emerge from the presence of a very large number of exponentially long relaxation time scales with broadly and densely distributed exponents @xcite .",
    "below , we will see in more detail how this is concretely realized in our setup . for now , let us just assume that at @xmath437 we quench the system of interest in some state that is not its equilibrium state , and that after this time it relaxes towards equilibrium along many different decay channels , characterized by exponentially large time scales @xmath441 , with the set of values of @xmath21 smoothly distributed over some finite range .",
    "suitable observables @xmath439 will evolve in time accordingly , picking up contributions from a broad range of the metastable , decaying modes .",
    "assuming the set of relaxation modes can be viewed as a continuum , we can write @xmath442 here @xmath443 is determined by the number density of relaxation modes with decay coefficient @xmath21 , by the dependence of the observable on these modes , and by the initial occupation numbers of the modes , set by the quench at @xmath437 .",
    "let us assume all of these factors depend in a smooth , @xmath10-independent way on @xmath21 , so that @xmath443 can be taken to be a smoothly varying , @xmath10-independent function .",
    "differentiating with respect to time and changing integration variables from @xmath21 to @xmath359 , we get : @xmath444 in the last step we made use of the assumption that @xmath259 is a slowly varying , @xmath10-independent function , implying that at large @xmath10 , the integral only receives significant contributions from values of @xmath359 of the same order of magnitude as @xmath445 , i.e.  @xmath446 . more explicitly , by expanding @xmath443 around @xmath447 , we get a @xmath448-expansion @xmath449 .    since the dependence on @xmath445 of @xmath450 is logarithmic and @xmath448-suppressed , we can take @xmath450 to be approximately constant over many orders of magnitude . and the microscopic time scale is @xmath451 , then for the range of time scales between @xmath452 sec and @xmath453 1 day , @xmath450 ranges from @xmath454 to about @xmath455 . for @xmath453",
    "10 years , we get to @xmath456 . ] thus , if @xmath457 is the rough time scale at which we are doing measurements , ( [ ratechange ] ) integrates simply to @xmath458 in other words , the system exhibits the ( approximate ) scale invariant aging behavior discussed above , with an aging rate set by @xmath459 and by the nature of the quench and other details of the system ( which determines @xmath259 ) .",
    "the essential feature leading to this conclusion is an approximately scale invariant distribution of relevant time scales , @xmath460 .",
    "this kind of logarithmic aging behavior is observed in a huge variety of glassy materials , ranging from the length of wires carrying weights to the conductivity of electron glasses @xcite .      for our black hole system",
    ", we will not really have a continuum of time scales , but rather a discrete set , corresponding to the probe charges allowing bound states .",
    "nevertheless , a sufficiently finely spaced set of charges is sufficient to get the logarithmic aging behavior described above . to see this , start from the discrete version of ( [ contdecay ] ) , that is @xmath461 , where @xmath462 .",
    "the rate of change of @xmath438 at time @xmath445 is then given by @xmath463 the idea is again that under suitable circumstances , this sum is dominated by terms with time scales @xmath464 of order @xmath445 , that is by values of @xmath465 . to see in more detail what suitable means , write @xmath466 ,",
    "so @xmath467 .",
    "the exponential factor is of order 1 when @xmath468 .",
    "it becomes exponentially small when @xmath469 , and double - exponentially small when @xmath470 .",
    "hence , provided the spacing of @xmath471 values is finer than @xmath448 and there are no sharp peaks or gaps in the values of @xmath472 , we have @xmath473 , hence for times @xmath474 , @xmath475 roughly of order @xmath457 : @xmath476 in other words , we get smooth logarithmic aging provided the values of @xmath477 are roughly uniformly distributed with spacings of order 1 or less .",
    "consider first a black brane in a region of parameter space where only metastable bound states exist , that is to say @xmath478 for all probe charges @xmath320 . in this case the equilibrium density ( [ mgammadensity2 ] ) , @xmath479 , will be exponentially small at large @xmath10 for all probe charges , since the probe potential @xmath480 scales linearly with @xmath10 .",
    "imagine however that by a suitable quench procedure , we will not try to explicitly describe such a procedure here but assume it can be done and only study the subsequent relaxation dynamics .",
    "possibilities could include the injection of a hot gas of many particles in a cold black hole background , the collision of two black holes at very high energies , creating a plasma ball which subsequently decays into many charged particles ( the analog of a collision of heavy ions hadronizing into jets of baryons ) , or a rapid change in the asymptotic parameters of the solution which may thermalize in part into a gas of charged particles of which a fraction will get trapped in potential wells . since thermal relaxation proceeds on non - exponential time scales , the cloud thus formed will cool down relatively rapidly , after which it will follow the slow relaxation dynamics described here .",
    "] we populate the metastable states such that for a large set of charges @xmath320 , the densities @xmath481 at time @xmath437 are _ not _ exponentially small .",
    "the sizable , metastable charge cloud we have thus created will then slowly decay back into the black hole , with a broad distribution of many exponentially large time scales .",
    "observables depending significantly on the amount of electric or magnetic charges in the cloud may therefore be expected to exhibit aging behavior .",
    "we will now argue in more detail that this is indeed the case .      in a classical stochastic picture , ignoring interactions between the probes , the time evolution of the probe number densities @xmath482 is given by @xmath483 where @xmath484 is the transition rate of probes out of the black hole into the metastable minimum and @xmath485 the reverse ( absorption ) rate .",
    "this is solved in general by @xmath486 where @xmath487 is the equilibrium density . for simplicity",
    "we will ignore the possibility of quantum tunneling here and only consider classical thermal activation processes .",
    "we will also ignore non - exponential prefactors .",
    "in this case the transition rates are @xmath488 where @xmath489 and @xmath490 are the potential barrier heights in and out of the black hole , respectively , that is , @xmath491 and @xmath492 .",
    "this leads to the correct detailed balance equilibrium densities @xmath493 .",
    "the relaxation dynamics will thus be entirely determined by the barrier properties of the probe potentials .",
    "to get an idea of how these depend on the background and probe parameters , we display some examples of potentials in fig .  [",
    "fig : examplepotentials ] .      in the case under study",
    "( only metastable bound states ) , we can set @xmath494 for all practical purposes , so ( [ generalstochasticsol ] ) reduces to a simple exponential decay of the densities @xmath481 , with time scale @xmath495 here we explicitly reinstated the scaling with @xmath10 and @xmath496 , using @xmath497 and @xmath498 .",
    "observables depending on the cloud charge densities ( for example the conductivity and other transport coefficients , which will pick up a contribution from the cloud ) can be expected to evolve in time with this spectrum of exponential decay time scales , matching the assumptions of our general discussion in section [ discretecase ] .",
    "thus observables of this kind can generically be expected to exhibit smooth logarithmic aging behavior , provided at least the spacing @xmath499 of @xmath500 values is much smaller than @xmath448 .",
    "to see under which conditions this is true , we need to take into account charge quantization . besides @xmath501 ,",
    "the integrally quantized probe charges are then @xmath502 , @xmath503 and @xmath504 , where we recall that @xmath505 , @xmath506 , @xmath507 .",
    "this implies that the quantized values of the rescaled charge variables are quantized with the following spacings : @xmath508 the region in @xmath509-space allowing bound states has finite volume . at fixed @xmath501 , the number of quantized charges in this volume scales as @xmath510 .",
    "recall that the validity of the probe approximation requires @xmath511 , that is @xmath512 .",
    "if we allow values of @xmath501 up to @xmath513 for some fixed @xmath514 , we thus get @xmath515 over this range of charges , @xmath500 takes values from 0 to an order @xmath516 upper bound .",
    "the average spacing of @xmath500 values near a generic point can therefore be expected ] to scale as @xmath517 .",
    "hence the time scale spacing condition discussed in section [ discretecase ] , @xmath518 , reduces to @xmath519 recalling ( [ abjmlike ] ) , we see that the left hand side equals @xmath520 ( or the central charge of the cft if there is a holographic dual ) , so this is nothing but the condition that the classical gravity description is reliable !    we conclude that whenever we trust the gravitational description , metastable probe clouds quenched to order one densities at time @xmath437 will exhibit logarithmic aging behavior when relaxing back to the pure black hole state .      to check the above assertions , we consider an explicit example .",
    "let the observable of interest be the total d0-charge in the cloud : @xmath521 here @xmath522 is the d0-charge component of the charge vector @xmath320 , and @xmath523 is the total charge in the region of interest , at time @xmath437 . to be concrete , we will assume we quench the initial particle densities to be proportional to what their abundance would be in flat space at a high temperature @xmath524 , i.e.  @xmath525 .",
    "( at this temperature , the distribution of charges is dominated by charges with @xmath526 . )",
    "we show the exact results for a specific choice of parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig : agingplots ] .",
    "clearly the results are in excellent agreement with the general discussion above .",
    "a natural question is whether there is a correlation between the distance of a bound probe to the horizon and the life expectancy of the bound state . translated to the dual cft , this becomes the question whether there is a correlation between the size of the inhomogeneity corresponding to the probe bound state and its life expectancy , with larger size mapping to shorter distances to the horizon . in section [ sec : pbhbopt ] we will see that the relevant notion of distance here is the `` optical distance '' , defined in ( [ opticaldist ] ) .",
    "the optical distance to the black hole horizon is proportional to the size of the charge inhomogeneity in the cft .",
    "a similar question can be asked about correlations between free energy and distance / size .    to explore these questions , we plot in [ fig : distplotsmeta ] the optical distance versus barrier height and free energy for all 15,862 charges with @xmath527 forming bound states .",
    "a first thing to note is that all bound states are localized within a fairly narrow band of distances , roughly in - between the horizon and the boundary of ads .",
    "this is also evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : holes ] .",
    "thus , in the cft , the inhomogeneities will have a fairly narrow range of characteristic scales .",
    "there is a mild correlation between distances and barrier heights , with the probes closest to the black hole having relatively low absorption barriers , and therefore relatively short lifetimes , and the probes most far away having the longest lifetimes . in the cft",
    ", this translates to the smallest structures being the most stable .",
    "the bound states closest to the black hole also all have relatively low free energies , although those the most far away are not the ones with the highest free energies .      when stable bound states exist , that is states with @xmath430 , the relaxation dynamics changes considerably .",
    "in fact in the presence of such minima , the system quickly runs out of the regime where we have the simplifying control of the probe approximation , since now the formal equilibrium densities are exponentially large rather than exponentially small .",
    "of course what this really means is that the probe approximation breaks down after some finite time .",
    "at least three effects may be expected to play a key role in the subsequent dynamics .",
    "first , due to charge depletion , the background will change by a non - negligible amount .",
    "second , the presence of a large density of probes in a potential well may favor or disfavor the arrival of other probes , depending on their charges . and",
    "third , probes may begin to cluster and clump together , thus either forming larger black holes , or multi - centered bound states amongst each other . over time , the system may thus be expected to sink irreversibly deeper into complicated bound states involving large numbers of centers of which the backreaction can no longer be neglected .",
    "although this is conceivably the truly glassy regime , it clearly falls outside of the scope of the probe approximation .",
    "nevertheless , some qualitative features about the onset of this phase can be made already with the results we have in hands .",
    "let us assume we start with a black brane _ without _ any bound probes , for example by a cooling quench of the temperature or the chemical potentials , starting from a high temperature black brane . from this point in time on , the negative potential minima will start to get populated , at a rate given by @xmath528 .",
    "naively , one might think the minima with the lowest @xmath529 will get populated first , but interestingly , this is not so .",
    "in fact quite the opposite is happening , as is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : barrierdistr10m7 ] : the lowest minima are shielded by the highest barriers , and they get populated at time scales many orders of magnitude larger than the shallower minima .",
    "in fact , the system will be far out of the probe regime long before the lowest free energy minima have even started to accumulate any noticeable charge .",
    "this is an explicit example of how for glassy systems , the relaxation path followed over time does not need to coincide at all with the steepest descent path towards the formal static equilibrium point .",
    "in the previous sections we have demonstrated the existence of black hole bound states in the probe approximation . the total number of different probe charges allowing bound states is proportional to @xmath530 , and besides the constraints related to the validity of the probe approximation , there is no limit in principle on the size or number of bound black holes . in the large @xmath54 limit",

    "these features are typical for glassy / amorphous systems , and thus we are lead to the hypothesis that these black hole bound states are in fact holographic descriptions of glassy phases of cfts with a gravity dual .    as a first step to make this idea more precise , we now turn to a number of observations relevant to the holographic interpretation of our results , assuming a dual cft exists . for simplicity , and because it has the most straightforward thermodynamical interpretation , we will again focus on the planar limit . in this section",

    "the vector potential modes falling off as @xmath544 on the other hand are interpreted as currents ; they are the response to the sources .",
    "more precisely , in gauge invariant terms , the component of the electric field normal to the boundary is identified with the charge density , @xmath545 , and components of the magnetic field parallel to the boundary are identified with the current density : @xmath546 .",
    "on the other hand the components of the electric field parallel to the boundary and the magnetic field component normal to the boundary are identified with external sources .",
    "electromagnetic duality exchanges electric and magnetic fields , and from the above it is clear that this symmetry does not commute with the dictionary .",
    "in fact , 4-dimensional s - duality acts as a symmetry relating different 3-dimensional cfts @xcite .    in the explicit bulk",
    "lagrangian ( [ modellag ] ) , we assumed a duality frame in which @xmath100 is electric and @xmath227 is magnetic . on the other hand , in our discussion of the thermodynamics of the background , we have been working in a grand canonical ensemble with fixed potentials @xmath241 and @xmath346 , which are more naturally interpreted in a duality frame in which both @xmath100 and @xmath227 are considered to be electric .",
    "so let us begin by assuming we are working in the latter frame .",
    "the bulk d0- and d4-charges are then identified with two global @xmath18 charges in the cft . denoting the associated cft charge densities by @xmath547 and @xmath548",
    ", we have ( for homogeneous planar solutions ) the identifications @xmath549 , @xmath550 .",
    "to summarize , cft quantities are related as follows to the dimensionless , scaling invariant tilde - variables of section [ scalingsymm ] ( which we used for example in all the phase diagrams of the preceding sections ) : @xmath551 and @xmath552 where for example @xmath553 .",
    "transport coefficients are easily obtained by making use of the general formulae of e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the d0-charge dc conductivity @xmath554 , susceptibility @xmath555 and diffusion coefficient @xmath556 are : @xmath557 here we made use of the explicit expressions given in section [ sec : planarlimit ] .",

    ", the viscosity is given by @xmath560 .",
    "the expressions given above imply various relations between cft quantities which are specific to the system under study , for instance @xmath561 .",
    "finally , we briefly return to the issue of the choice of duality frame .",
    "if we had chosen a frame in which the d4 is magnetic and the d2 electric , then our background would have been interpreted in the cft ( different from the original cft ) as having zero charge density @xmath562 and chemical potential @xmath563 , but a nonzero magnetization field and a constant magnetization density . at this level",
    ", this can perhaps be viewed as merely a different use of words , but it becomes important when we want to deduce the effect of the presence of probes bound to the black hole , to which we turn next .",
    "we now turn to the holographic interpretation of the black hole bound states .",
    "consider first the case of pure maxwell electrodynamics with lagrangian @xmath564 , and a particle with @xmath565 units of electric charge at rest in a fixed planar empty ads background , i.e.  in a metric @xmath566 ( where @xmath567 ) . without loss of generality we can assume the particle to be at @xmath568 .",
    "since the metric is conformally flat and maxwell s equations are conformally invariant , the electromagnetic field is identical to the field produced by a particle at rest in flat space .",
    "the electrostatic potential satisfies dirichlet boundary conditions at the plane @xmath569 , that is @xmath570 and hence @xmath571 ( or @xmath572 ) at @xmath569 .",
    "this is nothing but the classic textbook problem of a charge in the presence of an infinite perfect conductor at @xmath569 , solved most elegantly by the method of image charges .",
    "the potential is thus , with our charge conventions ( compare to ( [ modellagsimple ] ) , ( [ probeaction ] ) and ( [ abexpr ] ) ) : @xmath573 the expectation value of the charge density in the dual cft is given by the electric field strength at the boundary @xcite ( as is the induced charge density on the conducting plate in the classic electrostatics problem ) : @xmath574 we fixed the normalization by requiring the density to integrate to the total charge @xmath565 .",
    "the radius of the charge density peak is @xmath575 .",
    "let us now consider instead a magnetically charged particle .",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions on the vector potential imply @xmath576 ; they forbid magnetic flux through the @xmath569 boundary surface .",
    "the boundary conditions thus break electromagnetic duality : the magnetic field sourced by a magnetic charge , subject to the boundary conditions at hand , is not obtained by dualizing the electrostatic field [ electricpot ] , as this would give a magnetic field with @xmath577 instead of @xmath578 .",
    "rather it is obtained by dualizing the electrostatic field of a point charge with boundary conditions @xmath579 .",
    "this can again be constructed by the method of image charges , but this time with an image charge @xmath580 instead of @xmath581 .",
    "the nonvanishing components of the electromagnetic field strength at @xmath569 are then @xmath582 . this dualizes to the magnetostatic fields @xmath583 where @xmath584 is now the magnetic charge . in the cft",
    "dual , this corresponds to a medium with zero net charge density but with a nontrivial stationary vortex current , @xmath585 this can also be viewed as a `` magnetization '' current @xmath586 where the magnetization density is @xmath587 in the context of two dimensional incompressible fluid dynamics ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , @xmath588 is called the stream function , and @xmath589 is called the vorticity . the total current through a line from the origin to infinity is given by @xmath590 .    putting things together , we see that a general dyonic particle with charge @xmath591 at @xmath568 will correspond to a charge density @xmath592 and a magnetization density @xmath593 .",
    "applying this to our model in the duality frame where the d0 and d4 charges are considered to be electric charges ( and the scalar kept fixed ) , we see from ( [ modellagsimple ] ) that we have @xmath594 and @xmath595 .",
    "hence for an arbitrary probe charge @xmath257 , we get , in the notation ( [ probehats ] ) with @xmath596 , the following d0 and d4 charge and magnetization densities : @xmath597 note that under the symmetry ( [ d6d2symmetry ] ) , the magnetizations flip sign , while the charge densities remain invariant . in a duality frame with d4-charge considered to be magnetic , the roles of @xmath598 and @xmath599 would be exchanged , with the former giving rise to a magnetization density and the latter to a charge density .    for values of @xmath600 of order 1",
    ", @xmath601 is of order @xmath43 , causing the current density to be concentrated in a region of order @xmath43 .",
    "the charge density due to the probe will generically be much smaller than the background charge density ( [ bkgdens ] ) provided @xmath602 , which , not surprisingly , was the condition for the probe approximation to be valid .",
    "however since the background magnetic field vanishes , the magnetizations and corresponding spatial currents are entirely due to the probe .",
    "probes located at different positions will produce these currents appropriately translated in the @xmath603-plane , and multiple probes will produce currents which are superpositions of single probe currents .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ fig : vortices ] .",
    "more generally , the probes will also source the scalar and the metric , which in the cft corresponds to fluctuations in the expectation value of some scalar operator and in the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this can be studied in a similar way but we will not do this here .    for global ads ,",
    "a similar analysis can be done , although we can no longer make use of the simple map to flat space electromagnetism , so the gauge field propagator is somewhat more involved .",
    "we give the relevant expressions in appendix [ vector ] .",
    "to get a solution involving magnetic charges which is also consistent with dirichlet boundary conditions on the vector potential associated to our choice of duality frame , the total magnetic charge must be zero .",
    "in a dynamic setup , where we start off with a purely electrically charged black hole , this will be guaranteed by charge conservation .",
    "we now consider the system of actual interest , a probe charge in a general planar black hole background with a radially varying coupling constant .",
    "the background metric has the general form @xmath604 with ads@xmath17 asymptotics at @xmath605 , and the maxwell lagrangian takes the form @xmath606 . in our setup , we have @xmath607 , @xmath608 , @xmath609 and e.g.  @xmath610 , with the relevant explicit expressions given in ( [ planarmetricansatz])-([planarwarp ] ) .    in this case , it is no longer possible to find analytic solutions . in appendix [ app : particlesinbhbg ]",
    "we obtain a general approximate solution based on a wkb analysis .",
    "the final result is given in ( [ jseries ] ) , to which ( [ approxjt ] ) is a good enough approximation for our purposes : @xmath611 here @xmath612 and @xmath613 , @xmath614 are the `` optical distances '' coordinate defined by @xmath615 , de metric becomes spatially isotropic : @xmath616 .",
    "] from the boundary @xmath605 of ads to the horizon @xmath408 and to the probe @xmath617 , that is @xmath618 the first term in ( [ jteqwkb ] ) is similar to the empty ads solution ( [ ads4jt ] ) , and the second term can be interpreted as due to an image charge behind the black hole horizon .",
    "higher order corrections to this formula can similarly be interpreted as due to more image charges , obtained by subsequent mirroring over the horizon and boundary planes ; see the appendix for more details .    using this , we can now compute the cft charge density profiles corresponding to any cloud of bound probe particles .",
    "actual examples are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : densplots ] and [ fig : densplots2 ] . at low density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : densplots ] ) , we can still discern the charge disks associated to individual probes , at high density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : densplots2 ] ) this is no longer the case .",
    "( in this regime we would also expect the probe approximation to break down and interaction effects to become important . ) from the boundary cft point of view , the aging process described in section [ sec : meta - aging ] corresponds to a gradual , exponentially slow `` melting '' of the charged / magnetized lumps into the homogeneous background .",
    "on the other hand , the decay of the homogeneous state into stable bound states outlined in section [ sec : aging - stab ] corresponds to a gradual increase in inhomogeneity , up to and beyond the situation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : densplots2 ] .",
    "recall that the bound probe charges are all magnetically charged with respect to the background black hole , which means that they will be magnetically trapped by the background  classically , when kicked , they get stuck on circular orbits , quantum mechanically they form localized landau droplets .",
    "another way of thinking about this is that separated electric and magnetic charges come with intrinsic angular momentum stored in the electromagnetic field , so conservation of angular momentum will tend to obstruct free motion of the probes .",
    "similar rigidifying magnetic interactions occur between the different probes , as well as through backreaction polarization effects of the probes on the black hole horizon .",
    "thus we get a significant obstruction to spontaneous clumping or ordering effects one might naively have expected in the cloud , and various transport coefficients such as conductivity and viscosity may be strongly affected .    at a more basic level , due to thermal activation",
    ", we may expect some of the probes to wobble around in their magnetic traps while other lay dormant .",
    "furthermore , clusters of cloud particles may rearrange themselves and relax in a hierarchical cascade due to mutual interactions . in the cft",
    ", this will show up as _ dynamical _ inhomogeneities . even at high density , in contrast to the charge densities themselves ,",
    "these may still be expected to show up as distinguishable , locally active regions , since such regions will be relatively sparse , and their kinetic energy will only slowly be dissipated to other regions . in this way , inhomogeneities caused by probes will be different from inhomogeneities caused by a disordered horizon .",
    "the emergence of dynamical inhomogeneities appears to be a characteristic though not fully understood features of supercooled liquids near the glass transition @xcite .",
    "the effect we just described may be a holographic incarnation of this .",
    "the presence of a sufficiently dense probe cloud may also lead to a dramatic increase in viscosity , characteristic of approach to the glass transition .",
    "the shear viscosity @xmath14 can be viewed as momentum conductivity , more precisely e.g.  conductivity of @xmath619-momentum in the @xmath172-direction . when black branes are stirred in the @xmath620-direction",
    ", the induced momentum does not propagate far along @xmath172 on the horizon  rather it falls quickly into the black hole . as a result , the viscosity of a black brane is very low , leading to the famously low @xmath15 .",
    "however , this changes completely in the presence of a cloud with rigidifying magnetic interactions , as these interaction may have a strong drag effect , possibly leading to an enormous increase in momentum transport , i.e.  an enormous increase in shear viscosity .",
    "moreover , magnetic charges in the cloud may be expected to dramatically reduce charge transport efficiency by the black brane , by the `` eddy current brake '' mechanism @xcite .",
    "such a dramatic drop in ( global ) charge ( i.e.  matter ) transport efficiency is another feature characteristic of the approach to the glass transition .",
    "we leave exploration of these intriguing ideas to future work",
    ".      it would be desirable to have an explicit dual cft realization of our setup .",
    "the model we have studied can be characterized as the bosonic sector of an @xmath16 fayet - iliopoulos gauged supergravity with cubic prepotential .",
    "the two massless @xmath18s we have are sourced by charges which are parametrically heavier than the ads scale  they can be thought of as wrapped d0 , d2 , d4 and d6 branes in type iia .    in the flat space case",
    ", this model is a universal subsector of any type iia calabi - yau compactification , providing a consistent truncation of the corresponding four dimensional effective theories .",
    "the model we studied is basically the simplest possible uplift of this to ads .",
    "it would therefore seem logical that it should be equally easy to embed this model in string theory .",
    "in particular , flux compactifications , such as type iia on @xmath621 with @xmath10 units of rr 6-form flux and @xmath53 units of rr 2-form flux through the @xmath621 ( this one specifically being dual to the abjm quiver chern - simons cft @xcite ) , or related compactifications @xcite , would appear to be natural candidates .",
    "however there is a general obstruction to this idea .",
    "any ads@xmath622 compactification of type iia string theory which is supported by fluxes will have the property that some linear combination of the @xmath623 obtained by naively reducing the rr potentials coupling to wrapped d - branes is in fact higgsed and thus massive .",
    "the mechanism for this was exhibited explicitly for @xmath624 e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "a general diagnostic for a @xmath18 being higgsed is that magnetic monopole charges necessarily come with confining strings attached ; they are magnetic flux lines squeezed together by the meissner effect .",
    "now , if some compact @xmath584-cycle is threaded by @xmath424 units of ramond - ramond magnetic @xmath584-form flux , a d@xmath584-brane wrapped around this cycle will necessarily come with @xmath424 fundamental strings attached .",
    "this follows directly from gauss law for the d - brane worldvolume gauge theory : the flux creates a background charge for this gauge field , which due to the compactness of the brane must be canceled by the charge carried by open string endpoints .",
    "thus , at least one of the rr u(1)s present in the original calabi - yau compactification must be higgsed by turning on fluxes .",
    "this can also be seen more directly in flux compactifications of supergravity , with the higgs scalar emerging from the reduction of the dilation - axion . more specifically , for compactifications on @xmath621 with @xmath10 units of rr 6-form flux and @xmath53 units of rr 2-form flux , wrapped branes carrying d6- and d2-charge will generically come with strings attached , except for the specific ratio ( proportional to @xmath625 ) of the charges for which the two flux tadpoles exactly cancel each other .",
    "only the corresponding combination of the d0- and d4- @xmath623 survives as a gauge symmetry , the other one becomes massive .",
    "thus , if we try to embed our model in string theory in this way , we would have to accommodate these features .",
    "generic probes would have to come with fundamental strings attached ( stretched from the horizon to the probe or between the probes ) , and the massive photon would decay exponentially rather than polynomially .",
    "it can be checked that generically these `` stringy '' effects scale in exactly the same way with @xmath10 and @xmath283 as the other forces we considered .",
    "for example the probe potential ( [ vpvp ] ) for a d6 scales as @xmath626 . on the other hand , making the identification of the string length as in @xcite , @xmath61 , a string stretched over a coordinate distance @xmath627 would have an energy of order @xmath628 ( times something of order 1 , assuming @xmath629 is of other 1 ) .",
    "but by the above arguments , a single d6 comes not with one , but with @xmath10 strings attached .",
    "hence @xmath630 , the same scaling as the potential .",
    "this turns out to be the case for various other similar comparisons of scales .",
    "we conclude that in these models , the features we have exhibited are not obviously obliterated , nor are they obviously preserved .",
    "there are of course compactifications which can consistently be truncated to the model we consider . the simplest case in perhaps m - theory on ads@xmath631 , which corresponds to the case @xmath632 of the iia @xmath624 compactification considered above .",
    "the problem with these is that they have very light charged matter , with masses of the order of the ads scale , which will tend to condense and form superconducting condensates @xcite .",
    "this would again qualitatively affect our discussion . to physically trust our model",
    ", we need all charged matter to be parametrically heavy , which in at least the simpler examples means charges should be wrapped d - branes in a type ii picture ; in the usual freund - rubin compactifications , towers of charged kk modes tend to have masses going all the way down to the ads scale @xcite .",
    "this is not to say that in such cases glassy models are excluded .",
    "it is quite possible that analogous considerations can be made in the presence of light charged matter .",
    "but it would alter the analysis of this paper .",
    "borrowing language originating from the study of ads@xmath633 - cft@xmath17 pairs @xcite , we might call the heavy charges we have been assuming `` baryonic '' charges . indeed since it takes as many quarks as there are colors to make a baryon , states with nonzero baryon number in the cft are guaranteed to be heavy at large @xmath10 . from the bulk dual point of view , baryons are heavy because they correspond to internally wrapped branes .",
    "similar considerations hold for the ads@xmath634 - cft@xmath635 analogs @xcite .",
    "examples are m - theory compactifications on sasaki - einstein manifolds with nonzero betti number , such as @xmath636 , or quotients thereof @xcite .",
    "although this comes closer , our model is again not quite a consistent truncation of the low energy effective action of such models @xcite ; there are additional light scalars involved , which again may be expected to qualitatively change the analysis .",
    "a rather different class of flux compactifications involving calabi - yau orientifolds was studied in @xcite and black brane solutions in this setup were constructed in @xcite . in this case the obstruction to the most obvious attempts at embedding the model appear to be that the orientifold projection eliminates the desired massless @xmath18s , which is surely related to the above general considerations .",
    "it would be very interesting to follow a more direct top - down approach and see if bound states of the type we have analyzed here persist in models with a uv completion in string theory .",
    "in particular , in view of its genericity , it would be of interest to investigate the effect of the higgsed @xmath18 , specifically the impact of necessarily having strings attached to the probes .",
    "we have accomplished the following in this work :    1 .",
    "we have mapped out the complete thermodynamic phase diagram of a general class of nonextremal charged ads black hole solutions with running scalars , uncovering a rich phase structure .",
    "we have established the existence of finite temperature stationary bound states of these black holes with probe black holes .",
    "this implies the existence , in principle , of the corresponding nonlinear solutions to the coupled einstein equations .",
    "black branes can form stable and metastable bound states with arbitrary numbers of different charges , to a large extent trapped by magnetic forces .",
    "this leads to metastable , strongly disordered states with an extensive configurational entropy .",
    "in contrast to other studies of disordered holography @xcite , the disorder is not induced by sources ( which remain uniform ) , but is spontaneously generated .",
    "we have mapped out the regions in thermodynamic state space where such bound states can form , and have extensively studied their properties , including their dynamical and thermodynamical stability and the distributions of their radial sizes and barrier heights . 4 .   to the extent allowed by the probe approximation , and neglecting mutual probe interactions , we have studied the relaxation dynamics of clouds of bound probes , and established they exhibit logarithmic aging behavior characteristic for many amorphous systems .",
    "the aging rate at a given time scale is set by the density of states with a given barrier height set by the logarithm of the time scale .",
    "we have determined the detailed holographic map from bulk bound probe configurations to charge and vorticity densities in the dual cft . typically , quenched clouds of bound states map to structures of comparable characteristic sizes , but vastly different exponential lifetimes .",
    "at the static level , these bound state homogeneities may be hard to distinguish from horizon inhomogeneities .",
    "however they will have rather different dynamical signatures .",
    "in particular they may naturally lead to the striking dynamical heterogeneities and correlations that are observed in supercooled liquids .    the overall picture we propose",
    "is that whereas plain , smooth black branes are holographic duals of fluids , amorphously `` fragmented '' black branes represent more glassy phases of matter .",
    "most of the analysis of this paper was done in a probe approximation , and therefore the kind of fragmented branes we had actual control over were black branes dressed with clouds of charged probe black holes .",
    "nevertheless , already at this level we could demonstrate characteristic features of glassy relaxation , including logarithmic aging .",
    "if our overall picture is correct , such cloudy branes can be expected to interpolate between fluids and genuine glasses , and may exhibit the properties of supercooled liquids approaching the glass transition .",
    "if so , holography may provide important new insights into the still elusive nature of the glass transition , as it provides direct access to the thermodynamic state space , allows for efficient computation of transport coefficients ( which are the prime diagnostic for the approach to the glass transition ) , and is particularly powerful exactly in regimes that are relevant to glassy physics",
    ". however , more work is needed towards this goal , including the following :    1 .",
    "as we have seen , the black hole horizon itself is thermodynamically unstable ( perturbatively in some case , nonperturbatively in others ) to formation of inhomogeneities , similar to the instabilities found in @xcite .",
    "the relative importance of this compared to the inhomogeneities caused by bound particles needs to be assessed .",
    "for some but not all of the black branes forming bound states , there is indeed a perturbative thermodynamic instability in the grand canonical ensemble , which suggests instability towards inhomogeneities ( phase mixtures ) in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "one may wonder if such phase mixtures may be exhibited by a purely thermodynamic analysis , similar to @xcite .",
    "if we restrict to mixtures of the black brane phases described in this paper , the answer is no . for two phases to coexist , their temperature , chemical potentials and pressure ( free energy density ) must be equal .",
    "it can be checked that for our black brane phases , this implies the phases are identical .",
    "it seems therefore that a direct analysis of spatially inhomogeneous solutions , along the lines of @xcite , will be necessary to investigate this question .",
    "supercooled liquids and glasses are produced by thermal quenches , i.e.  fast cooling of the liquid phase .",
    "the properties of the resulting phase depend crucially on the cooling rate .",
    "we did not work out in any detail a concrete holographic realization of such a quench ( although we did give some suggestions in footnote [ fnquench ] ) .",
    "it would be interesting to do so .",
    "since the result of a quench is effectively immediate , it is plausible that the classical instabilities mentioned above may play an important role ; for example one could imagine a gregory - laflamme type instability @xcite ( augmented by quantum effects to allow horizons to split off ) spitting out large droplets of black hole brane , along the lines of e.g.  @xcite , getting subsequently trapped in metastable potential wells .",
    "3 .   the setups we studied in which the probe approximation remains valid at all times , namely clouds of probe charges that are not too dense and that are metastable , do not describe genuine glasses , since they ultimately return to the liquid ( bare black brane ) state . to get a system",
    "that does not relax back to the liquid phase , we need to go to regimes where stable bound states exist .",
    "here we did see indications of relaxation dynamics getting irreversibly lost in the free energy landscape , a characteristic feature in many theories of glasses .",
    "however in this case we exit the probe regime in finite time .",
    "therefore to really probe the glass phase and the glass transition , it will be important to go beyond the probe approximation .",
    "some of the features that can be expected to arise were outlined in section [ sec : aging - stab ] .",
    "we should also point out that even within the probe approximation , neglecting probe - probe interactions on exponentially long time scales is physically not justified , in particular not if these interactions may lead to probe black holes merging into larger and therefore more stable black holes .",
    "taking probe interactions into account at this level can be done without having to solve for the fully backreacted geometries .",
    "we restricted to relaxation through classical thermal activation . at sufficiently low temperatures ,",
    "quantum tunneling will become the dominant channel .",
    "the amplitude for tunneling through a barrier is suppressed by an exponential factor @xmath637 , which can be computed directly from e.g.  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "it would be very interesting to compute holographic transport coefficients in the presence of black hole bound states .",
    "the approach to the glass transition by supercooled liquids is characterized by dynamical arrest without any static structural changes , and associated to this a dramatic increase in shear viscosity and decrease in diffusion coefficients . since we no longer have a single horizon , but rather a fragmented conglomerate of horizons , there is no reason for the universal results for viscosity and conductivity to remain valid .",
    "in fact , tracing the reasoning of @xcite , it is clear that the presence of matter in the bulk will significantly alter these universality results . as we mentioned in section",
    "[ sec : transport ] , there are good reasons to believe even modest clouds could lead to dramatic increase in the shear viscosity .",
    "6 .   as discussed in section [ sec : strings ] , there are obstacles to finding an explicit holographic dual of our model as it stands .",
    "although the theory we start from is very similar to the low energy effective theory dual to the abjm cft @xcite , it misses the higgs scalar that renders one of the @xmath623 massive , and forces d6- and d2-charges to come with strings attached .",
    "we argued that this feature is in fact universal for any freund - rubin - like string flux compactification .",
    "it would therefore seem quite important to see what the impact is of adding this feature to the analysis . 7 .",
    "more generally , it would be useful to propose simplified models to capture the essential physics of glassy holography in a more transparent way .",
    "our model was motivated primarily because it was the simplest uplift of asymptotically flat @xmath16 supergravity to ads , making it likely a priori that black hole bound states would be found .",
    "but obviously , if we do not insist to this relation , much simpler models might be possible .",
    "indeed if we extrapolate to the fullest extent the real - world observation that virtually all known liquids form glasses when cooled sufficiently fast , we should expect glassy states to appear in setups simpler than ours .",
    "finally , it will of course be extremely interesting to ultimately extract general lessons from the holographic picture for the general theory of the glass transition .",
    "the geometrization of scale hierarchies , the natural symbiosis of thermodynamic and kinetic aspects and the easy access to out - of - equilibrium physics that are offered by holography , all of crucial importance for any theory of glasses , make us think that there are indeed important lessons to be learned from the holographic approach .",
    "conversely , one may hope that empirical knowledge of the properties of glasses will then lead to a better understanding of the fundamental landscape of quantum gravity , de sitter space , and the universe itself .",
