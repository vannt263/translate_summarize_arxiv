    "the eulerian walkers model introduced in @xcite as an example of self - organized criticality @xcite , was rediscovered later by researchers in different fields and attracted much attention due to its simple algorithmic structure @xcite .",
    "some properties of the eulerian walkers , stated in @xcite and in the related paper @xcite , were formulated then as rigorous graph - theoretical theorems @xcite . in the mathematical literature ,",
    "the model received the name `` rotor - router walk '' proposed by jim propp @xcite , who considered it as a derandomized analogue of the ordinary random walk .",
    "a formal definition of the rotor - router walk is given in section ii . in a less formal way ,",
    "one considers a lattice with arrows attached to the lattice sites .",
    "the arrow at every site is directed to one of its neighbors on the lattice .",
    "a particle ( chip ) performs a walk jumping from a site to a neighboring site . arriving to a given site",
    ", the chip changes the direction of the arrow at this site to next position , for instance 90 degrees clockwise , and moves to the neighbor pointed by new position of the arrow .",
    "thus , given an initial orientation of arrows on the whole lattice , the rotor - router walk is fully deterministic .",
    "fig.[steps ] illustrates three steps of the rotor walk on the square lattice .        at present , the basic properties of the rotor - router walks on finite graphs can be considered as well established .",
    "the walk starting from an arbitrary vertex of a finite eulerian graph @xmath1 ( see the definition below ) eventually settles into an eulerian circuit where each directed edge of @xmath1 is visited exactly once .",
    "when the walker is in the eulerian circuit , configurations of rotors associated to vertices of @xmath1 are recurrent . a striking property of the recurrent state is a filling of loops formed by rotors on a planar graph @xmath1 under clockwise rotations of rotors : if a sequence of rotors makes up a closed clockwise oriented contour @xmath2 on @xmath1 at some moment of the eulerian circuit , the walker enters into contour @xmath2 in a vertex @xmath3 , performs a full rotation of each rotor internal to @xmath2 , changes the orientation of rotors on @xmath2 to opposite and leaves the contour in the same vertex @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this property of the contour is called _",
    "reversibility_. recently , chan , church and grochow @xcite have noticed that the reversibility of all cycles on a graph is a test whether the given graph is planar or not .",
    "specifically , they proved that a connected loopless graph is planar if and only if all cycles are reversible under the rotor - router dynamics .",
    "the behavior of the rotor - router walk on infinite graphs is quite different .",
    "let @xmath1 be an infinite square lattice with the rotors associated to each vertex .",
    "each rotor has four possible directions ordered clockwise .",
    "the initial orientations of rotors are independently distributed with equal probabilities for each direction .",
    "the walker starting at the origin performs a diffusion - like motion .",
    "however , the exponent @xmath4 in the law of the mean - square displacement for @xmath5 steps @xmath6 differs considerably from its random walk value @xmath7 .",
    "extensive computer experiments show that @xmath8 with high precision .",
    "a qualitative derivation of the subdiffusion law @xmath8 in @xcite is far from a rigorous proof although the arguments given there seem to be credible .",
    "these arguments are based on an assumption that the walker s trajectory covers a kernel of the cluster almost densely before reaching the shell of the cluster again .",
    "then , the radius of kernel grows with a velocity inversely proportional to the area of the kernel , so the average radius @xmath9 . despite a strong numerical evidence for the assumption , there are no theoretical explanations of this unusual behavior of the rotor - router walk .",
    "the aim of the present work is to consider the motion of the rotor - router walk in a random environment in more detail .",
    "analyzing the trajectories of a walk inside closed contours , we find a rigorous rule of visiting a closed contour emerged in a random rotor configuration .",
    "namely , we prove a property which we call the _ weak reversibility _ for the rotor - router walks , where the condition of the full rotation of each rotor internal to the contour is released . instead , some rotors inside @xmath2 perform a partial rotation or do not move at all .",
    "nevertheless , two properties of reversibility are still retained : the rotor - router walk entering @xmath2 in a vertex @xmath10 leaves the contour in the same vertex @xmath0 , and the clockwise orientation of rotors on the contour @xmath2 becomes anti - clockwise .",
    "we consider the rotor - router walk inside the contour and we describe precisely which part of the contour interior is filled by the trajectory of the walk .",
    "then , we discuss a possible relation of the loop reversibility to the subdiffusion of the rotor - router walk on the infinite lattice .",
    "we observe that the set of vertices , where rotors make up clockwise contours , grows according to a definite rule , namely , the sequence of such vertices generates a spiral - like structure .",
    "moreover , the obtained spirals , being random , in average obey an unexpected law which we call the asymptotical _",
    "archimedean _ property .",
    "the spiral - like structure of the reference points of the closed clockwise contours together with the weak reversibility of contours provides the subdiffusion behavior of the rotor - router walk .",
    "consider a directed graph ( digraph ) @xmath11 with a set of vertices @xmath12 and a set of directed edges @xmath13 .",
    "we assume that there are no self - loops or multiple edges in @xmath1 although the definition of the model can be extended to this case .",
    "if for each edge directed from @xmath0 to @xmath14 there exists an edge directed from @xmath14 to @xmath0 , we call the graph @xmath1 bidirected",
    ". a bidirected graph can be obtained by replacing each edge of an undirected graph with a pair of directed edges , one in each direction .",

    "a path of length @xmath5 from vertex @xmath18 to @xmath19 is a sequence of distinct vertices @xmath20 such that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are connected by an edge @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the path becomes a cycle if @xmath27 .",
    "a shortest possible cycle has length @xmath28 and consists of two adjacent vertices @xmath29 , @xmath30 , which are connected by a pair of edges from @xmath29 to @xmath30 and back .",
    "we call such cycles dimers by analogy with lattice dimers covering two neighboring vertices . a cycle formed by more than two edges",
    "is called contour .",
    "an eulerian circuit on a finite digraph is a walk which starts and ends on the same vertex and visits each directed edge exactly once . if such a walk exists , the digraph is called eulerian .",

    "the set @xmath38 defines the rotor configuration . starting with an arbitrary rotor configuration , one drops a chip to a vertex of @xmath1 chosen at random . at each time",
    "step the chip arriving at a vertex @xmath0 , first changes the rotor direction from @xmath35 to @xmath39 , and then moves one step along the new rotor direction from @xmath0 to the corresponding neighboring vertex .",
    "the periodicity of @xmath40 is assumed @xmath41 .",
    "the rotor configuration @xmath42 can be considered as a spanning subgraph of @xmath1 @xmath43 with the set of vertices @xmath44 and the set of directed edges @xmath45 coinciding with the rotors .",
    "the state of the system at any moment of time is given by the pair @xmath46 of the rotor configuration @xmath42 and the position of the chip @xmath31 .",
    "a vertex @xmath31 is called sink if its out - degree @xmath47 . in the absence of sinks ,",
    "i.e. when each vertex has at least one outgoing edge , the motion of the chip does not stop .",
    "if iterating the rotor - router operation from the state @xmath48 eventually leads back to @xmath48 we say that @xmath48 is recurrent ; transient otherwise . according to arguments in @xcite , the rotor - router walk , started from an arbitrary initial state @xmath46 on a finite graph , passes transient states and enters into a recurrent state continuing the motion in the limiting cycle which is the eulerian circuit of the graph .    in @xcite a useful notion of _ unicycle",

    "if one iterates the rotor - router operation @xmath50 times starting from @xmath46 , the chip traverses an euler tour of @xmath1 , each rotor makes one full turn , and the state of the system returns to @xmath46 .",

    "the obtained single - chip - and - rotor state on the auxiliary graph @xmath106 is the unicycle @xmath113 .",

    "it is straightforward to see that the first visit of the rotor walk to @xmath98 is followed by @xmath115 steps which make the orientation of rotors clockwise , whereas the first visit to every internal contour @xmath116 is followed by @xmath117 steps which make the orientation on @xmath116 anticlockwise .",

    "indeed , let @xmath123 be a cycle oriented clockwise .",
    "if there are no internal cycles inside @xmath124 , then the first hit of a chip to the contour @xmath124 converts , by theorem 1 , the orientation of @xmath124 into anticlockwise after visiting its interior . then , we can simply skip the interval of the chip evolution between the moments of entry and exit from @xmath124 considering the orientation of @xmath124 as anticlockwise . if the interior of cycle @xmath124 contains anticlockwise cycles only , we can skip the mentioned interval of the evolution , by theorem 2 .",
    "if there are clockwise cycles inside @xmath124 , then we can apply the skipping procedure recursively .",
    "since each generation of cycles is enclosed in the previous one , we eventually reach a smallest cycle which does not contain any cycle inside .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the crucial concepts used for explanation of the subdiffusion behavior of the rotor - router walk on the infinite lattice are the kernel - shell structure of the cluster of visited vertices and the assumption that the trajectory of the walk covers the kernel almost densely in intervals between periodic returns to the shell .",
    "this property was approved by extensive simulations @xcite , but yet a detailed explanation has not been presented . in this section ,",

    "we are interested in relative disposition of contours and labels appeared during time @xmath69 .    to distinguish between rotors which did not move until the given moment of time and those involved into the motion , we call the moved rotors _ activated_. a current position of all activated rotors , except the last one , forms a single rooted tree @xmath136 . the location of the root is a current position of the chip .",

    "a preferable position for @xmath139 is on the right side of the branch @xmath137 to provide clockwise orientation of the contour @xmath140 if it has common edges with @xmath137 .",

    "<S> we use the proven property for an analysis of the sub - diffusive behavior of the rotor - router walk .    </S>",
    "<S> _ keywords _ : rotor - router walk , euler walk , spanning tree , unicycle . </S>"
