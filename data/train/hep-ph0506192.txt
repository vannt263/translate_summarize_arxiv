    "recently we have proposed  @xcite a following nonsymmetric mass matrix model for all quarks and leptons based on an extended flavor @xmath0 symmetry with one phase : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are real parameters and @xmath11 is a phase parameter . here ,",

    "the mass matrices @xmath20 and @xmath21 are , respectively , the dirac and the right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrices , which are included in the model if we assume the seesaw mechanism @xcite for neutrino masses . in this model",
    ", we assume that all the mass matrices for quarks and leptons have this common structure , which is against the conventional picture that the mass matrix forms in the quark sector take somewhat different structures from those in the lepton sector . in our previous works",

    ", the neutrino mass matrix @xmath14 should be symmetric .",
    "namely , we further assume @xmath22    in the scenario that the neutrino mass matrix is constructed via the seesaw mechanism , i.e. @xmath23 , the structure of @xmath14 mentioned above is alternatively realized by using the following two assumptions : ( i ) the mass matrices @xmath20 and @xmath21 have the same extended flavor 2 @xmath24 3 symmetry in eq.([ourmf ] ) with identical phase parameters , i.e. @xmath25 .",
