    "the energy density of all observed forms of classical matter is non - negative",
    ". however , quantum field theory has the remarkable property that the local energy density can be negative .",
    "this violates the weak energy condition ( wec ) which postulates that the local energy density is non - negative for all observers .",
    "its formal statement is that a stress tensor @xmath0 satisfies the wec provided that @xmath1 for all timelike vectors @xmath2 .",
    "negative energy densities raise the possibility of a variety of exotic phenomena , including violations of the second law of thermodynamics @xcite , traversable wormholes @xcite and `` faster - than - light '' travel @xcite , creation of naked singularities @xcite , and avoidance of singularities in gravitational collapse .",
    "however , in the case of inflationary cosmology it has recently been found that violations of the wec do not allow one to avoid initial singularities @xcite .",
    "the interest attached to the effects of negative energy has stimulated the study of constraints on the magnitude and extent of wec violations .",
    "although the energy density at a point can be arbitrarily negative , there are several integral constraints which we will briefly review for the case of flat spacetime .",
    "one constraint is that the integral of the energy density over all space , the hamiltonian , is bounded below .",
    "other constraints involve integrals over the world line of an observer , a construction first introduced by tipler  @xcite .",
    "one such constraint is the averaged weak energy condition ( awec ) , which states that the integral of the energy density seen by a geodesic observer is non - negative : @xmath3 here @xmath2 and @xmath4 are the observer s four - velocity and proper time , respectively .",
    "this condition has been proven to hold for a variety of free quantum field theories in boundary - free minkowski spacetime .",
    "it does not always hold inside of a cavity in flat spacetime because the casimir energy density can be negative .",
    "however , even in this case , observers at rest with respect to the cavity walls will see a modified version of eq .",
    "( [ eq : awec ] ) satisfied .",
    "this is the `` difference awec '' in which @xmath0 is replaced by the difference between the expectation value of the stress tensor in an arbitrary quantum state and that in the vacuum state @xcite .",
    "the physical content of this statement is that although the local energy density can be made more negative than in the vacuum , the time - integrated energy density can not .",
    "a related averaged energy condition is the averaged null energy condition ( anec ) , in which the integration is along a null geodesic .",
    "it also holds in boundary - free minkowski spacetime @xcite .",
    "the extent to which the awec and anec hold for quantum field theories in curved spacetime is less clear @xcite .",
    "although the awec imposes a significant constraint on negative energy , even stronger constraints are available in the form of `` quantum inequalities '' , ( qis ) @xcite . these are lower bounds on time integrals of the energy density multiplied by a sampling function , @xmath5 : @xmath6 the lower bound , @xmath7 , depends upon the sampling function and upon the spacetime . for the massless scalar field in two - dimensional minkowski spacetime ,",
    "flanagan @xcite has found the optimal bound : @xmath8 for the massless scalar field in four - dimensional minkowski spacetime , fewster and eveson @xcite have given a similar ( but not necessarily optimal ) bound : @xmath9    if the sampling function has a characteristic width @xmath10 , then the lower bounds are of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the dimensionality of spacetime .",
    "the awec can be derived from the qis as the limit in which @xmath13 .",
    "the essential physical content of the qis is that the larger a pulse of negative @xmath14  energy is , the closer in time it must be to a compensating pulse of positive @xmath15  energy . consider for example @xmath16-function pulses of @xmath15  and @xmath14  energy where the energy density in an observer s frame is given by @xmath17 \\ , .",

    "thus as the strength @xmath20 of the @xmath14  pulse increases , its separation in time from the compensating @xmath15  pulse must decrease as an inverse power of @xmath20 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it is further shown that the qis imply the phenomenon of _ quantum interest_. as the temporal separation of the @xmath14  and @xmath15   pulses increases , within the limits set by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tmax2d ] ) and ( [ eq : tmax4d ] ) , the degree of overcompensation must increase .",
    "thus the parameter @xmath26 must be a monotonically increasing function of @xmath18 .",
    "a discussion of quantum interest for more general pulses was given by pretorius @xcite and by fewster and teo @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to initiate an exploration of the limits on the spatial distribution of @xmath14  energy .",
    "the worldline qis summarized in the previous subsection provide one tool for this investigation .",
    "clearly , for massless fields , the temporal separation of a pair of pulses as seen by an inertial observer is also a measure of their spatial separation .",
    "however , a more detailed picture is desirable .",
    "several approaches can be pursued in the search for a description of the allowed spatial @xmath14  energy distributions .",
    "one is to seek generalizations of the qis which involve averaging over space as well as time .",
    "another approach is to use the awec and qis to place constraints upon the allowed spacetime distributions .",
    "the approach seeks to extract as much information as possible from the requirement that the awec and qis be satisfied along all timelike geodesics .",
    "a third approach is to examine the nature of distributions which are definitely allowed and can be explicitly constructed .",
    "all three approaches will be illustrated in this paper .",

    "as part of this discussion , it is useful to distinguish between wec violations in which the local energy density is negative for all observers ( `` strong '' violations ) , and those in which its sign depends upon the observer ( `` weak '' violations ) .",
    "the technical details of this distinction are elaborated in the appendix .",
    "section  [ sec : awec ] explores the limits of the awec , and shows that it would not hold if one were to integrate along a piecewise geodesic path .",

    "units in which @xmath27 and a spacelike metric convention are used in this paper .",
    "there are two disturbing results which might be construed as casting doubt upon the existence of constraints on the spatial distribution of negative energy .",
    "the first is an unpublished result of garfinkle @xcite , who showed that the total energy contained within an imaginary box in minkowski spacetime is unbounded below .",
    "let us first give a more precise statement of this result .",
    "consider a quantum field @xmath28 in boundary - free minkowski spacetime . by",
    "boundary - free , we mean that there are no physical boundaries upon which @xmath28 must satisfy boundary conditions .",
    "let @xmath29 be the normal - ordered energy density operator for @xmath28 on a @xmath30 constant hypersurface .",
    "now consider a volume @xmath31 , e.g. , the interior of an arbitrary rectangular box , and let @xmath32 be the energy inside this box in quantum state @xmath33 .",
    "this box is `` imaginary '' in the sense that there are no physical boundaries at the walls of the box .",
    "the garfinkle result is that @xmath34 is unbounded below .",
    "that is , there exist states @xmath33 for which @xmath34 is arbitrarily negative .",
    "note that this would not happen if the box were a physical box on whose walls @xmath28 must satisfy dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions . in this case",
    ", @xmath34 is the hamiltonian for @xmath28 within this cavity , and is bounded below by the casimir energy of the cavity .",
    "the garfinkle box is illustrated .",
    "a @xmath16-function pulse of @xmath15 energy has already passed through the box before time @xmath35 . at time @xmath35 , a @xmath16-function pulse of @xmath14 energy is inside the box .",
    "the magnitude of this @xmath14 pulse is inversely related to the distance to the @xmath15 pulse at a fixed time .",
    "however , we can always arrange for the @xmath15 pulse to be just outside the box , and for the @xmath14 pulse to be just inside .",
    "thus there can be an arbitrary amount of @xmath14 energy inside the box at @xmath35 . ]     here @xmath36 is a spacelike hypersurface which is asymptotic to a null surface , the dashed line .",
    "this allows @xmath36 to catch a @xmath16-function pulse of @xmath14 energy , while also avoiding the compensating @xmath16-function pulse of @xmath15 energy . in this way",
    ", the integrated energy over @xmath36 may be made arbitrarily negative . ]",
    "a second disturbing result was given by helfer @xcite , who showed that the integral of the energy density over a spacelike hypersurface can be unbounded below .",
    "although this result applies to curved , as well as flat spacetime , let us focus on the case of minkowski spacetime .",
    "let @xmath37 be a timelike vector field on minkowski spacetime , and let @xmath36 be a spacelike hypersurface to which @xmath37 is orthogonal .",
    "further let @xmath38 here @xmath39 is the volume element in @xmath36 , and @xmath40 is a test function with compact support .",
    "the quantity @xmath41 is an energy operator ( generalized hamiltonian ) obtained by integrating the energy density in state @xmath33 ( times the test function @xmath40 ) over @xmath36 .",
    "helfer has shown that in general , @xmath41 is unbounded below .",
    "note that in the limit that @xmath42 everywhere and @xmath37 is the timelike killing vector , @xmath41 becomes the usual hamiltonian , which has the lower bound of zero , attained in the minkowski vacuum state .",
    "note also that the helfer result includes the garfinkle result as the special case in which @xmath36 is a constant @xmath43 ( minkowski time ) surface and @xmath40 approaches a step function which is @xmath44 inside the box and @xmath45 outside of it",
    ".    both of these results might lead one to conclude that there can be no bounds on the spatial distribution of negative energy which would be analogous to the temporal bounds given by the quantum inequalities .",
    "thus it is desirable to understand the physical basis of these results in more detail .",
    "consider first the garfinkle box .",
    "we can understand the unboundedness of the total energy @xmath34 in this box as arising from two factors : ( 1 ) the energy is measured at a precise instant in time , and ( 2 ) the walls of the box are sharply defined .",
    "this allows an arbitrary amount of negative energy to have entered the box by time @xmath43 , while at this time excluding an even larger amount of positive energy which may be just outside of the box at time @xmath43 .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gar_box ] .",
    "the unboundedness of helfer s @xmath46 is harder to understand , although in particular cases one can give intuitive explanations similar to that in the garfinkle box case .",
    "let the hypersurface @xmath36 be asymptotically null , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : helf_slice ] . in this case",
    ", it is possible for the integral of the energy density over @xmath36 to include the contribution of an arbitrarily large negative energy pulse , but to omit that of an even larger positive pulse which preceded the negative pulse .",
    "once we include the effects of the test function @xmath40 , it is not necessary that @xmath36 be asymptotically null ; it can level out and approach a constant @xmath43 surface outside of the domain of support of @xmath40 .",
    "these considerations might suggest that the garfinkle and helfer results arise by methods of spatial averaging which manage to capture large amounts of @xmath14 energy while ignoring larger amounts of @xmath15 energy which are really very close by .",
    "however , the general result of helfer is not so easily explained . even if @xmath36 is a constant @xmath43 surface , @xmath46",
    "need not be bounded below in general in four - dimensional spacetime . in this case",
    ", we are dealing with the generalization of the garfinkle result where the walls of the box cease to be sharply defined .",
    "this seems to suggest that spatial averaging without time averaging may not be sufficient to yield quantities which are bounded below .",
    "we now turn to the question of whether one can derive generalizations of the quantum inequalities which involve averaging over both space and time . in two - dimensional spacetime , this can indeed be done .",
    "this was first done by one of us @xcite using a method analogous to those used in ref .",
    "@xcite to first prove worldline quantum inequalities .",
    "flanagan @xcite later noted that his method may also be used to generate two - dimensional spacetime averaged quantum inequalities .",

    "note that in two dimensions one also has a nontrivial bound from spatial averaging alone when @xmath66 .",
    "the extent to which the type of results found here in two dimensions can be generalized to four dimensions is unclear .",
    "it seems that there one may need the temporal averaging to get a bound .",
    "we can rule out several spatial distributions of @xmath15  and @xmath14  energy by applying the awec  and the qis to their possible evolutions . in all of the examples given below",
    "we assume that the violations of the wec  are strong , i.e. , if the energy density is negative in one frame then it is negative in all frames .",
    "( see the appendix for further details . )",
    "this assumption is necessary for the following discussion . in most of the cases",
    "we will be specifically considering null fluids , i.e. , @xmath67 for such stress tensors the violations of the wec  are strong , as can be easily shown .",

    "we consider situations in which the @xmath15  energy moves `` rigidly '' in that the null flow vector @xmath70 in the energy - momentum tensor , eq .  ( [ eq : nfluid ] ) , is constant in cartesian coordinates . more general evolutions are discussed in sec .",

    "if this world tube never crosses the time axis , an observer sitting on the axis throughout will never encounter the @xmath15  energy and his worldline will violate the  awec .",

    "next , consider the case where the world tube crosses the time axis in the future direction .",
    "( the case when it crosses it in the past direction is covered by the time - reverse of the argument presented below . )",
    "this means that the positive energy flows across the future of the region where there was negative energy , as shown in fig .",

    "since the motion of the positive energy is rigid , its world tube does not expand in either time direction .",

    "it is possible to arrange for the observer to see net negative integrated energy for selected values of the parameters @xmath265 , @xmath193 and @xmath10 .",
    "for example , @xmath266 is plotted in fig .  [",

    "the result can be either positive or negative .",
    "the cavity contains net positive energy , but with oscillatory pockets of negative energy density .",
    "an observer who enters the cavity at certain times during the cycle will manage to see net negative energy , whereas one who enters at other times may see net positive energy .",
    "it is also of interest to look at @xmath266 as a function of @xmath193 for fixed @xmath265 and @xmath10 .",

    "note that for smaller values of @xmath193 , @xmath269 , whereas larger values of @xmath193 allow the observer to see net negative energy , @xmath270 . if the observer spends too long in the cavity , the energy oscillations cause the time - integrated energy to be positive , but a speedier observer can manage to catch net negative energy .",
    "again it is important to emphasize that this net negative energy represents only the contribution of the quantum field in the cavity and not of the walls themselves . for any realistic cavity ,",
    "it is overwhelmingly likely that the awec integral including the walls rest mass energy will be positive .",

    "let us summarize some of the results obtained in this paper , as well as some of the unanswered questions which this investigation has raised .",
    "we have given some explicit examples of spacetime averaged quantum inequalities in two - dimensional spacetime .",
    "however , the problem of finding similar results in four - dimensional spacetime is unsolved . we have used the awec and qis to rule out or limit some particular model distributions of @xmath14   energy .",
    "in particular , the `` cap the cone '' argument given in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : fcdistr : f : sep ] shows that one can not have a piece of @xmath14   energy separated from rigidly moving positive energy .",
    "we were able to give quantitative restrictions on other possible distributions .",

    "however , much more work needs to be done to narrow the gap between distributions which can be ruled out and those which are definitely allowed . as part of our investigation ,",
    "we have introduced the distinction between strong and weak violations of the wec , which is likely to prove useful in future work on this subject .",
    "we have also tested the limits of the awec and provided counterexamples to the awec along piecewise geodesics and to the difference awec for observers who pass through a cavity .",
    "these types of counterexamples are useful for understanding more clearly just which conditions can be used to constrain spatial distributions of @xmath14  energy .",
    "future work in this area will involve a search for a more systematic ways to use information from worldline integrals to reconstruct or constrain spatial and spacetime distributions of @xmath14   energy .",
