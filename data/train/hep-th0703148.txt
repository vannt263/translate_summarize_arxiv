    ", it has recently been used to argue for the _ generic _ existence of long - lived meta - stable supersymmetry breaking vacua in supersymmetric gauge theories @xcite . in order to further exploit the fruitful interplay between gauge theory and string theory , it is natural to realize seiberg duality within a brane set - up in string theory @xcite . to sharpen the embedding map , it is useful to incorporate the backreaction of the heaviest , ns5-branes , used within the brane set - up into the background geometry",
    ". it is possible to do this in a double scaling limit @xcite .",
    "the d - branes that realize the gauge theories can then be described by an exact boundary conformal field theory , and one can analyze seiberg duality exactly within string theory , as argued and realized in @xcite for supersymmetric qcd with @xmath12 gauge group .",
    "it is worth trying to extend this to @xmath13 and @xmath14 gauge theories , since both the bulk and boundary conformal field theories , as well as the gauge theories , realize new physical phenomena .    in the rest of the introduction we review seiberg duality in @xmath15 gauge theories @xcite in the context of ns@xmath6/d - brane set - ups in type iia string theory , in as far as it is useful for our present purposes .",
    "we then move to a worldsheet description of the backreacted theory in a double scaling limit in section [ worldsheet ] .",
    "the main technical result in this section is the computation of the supersymmetric crosscap states built on the representations of the @xmath16 superconformal algebra . in the modular bootstrap procedure",
    "used to construct d - branes in liouville theory @xcite and their supersymmetric extensions , @xcite , the crosscap states are found by requiring that , in the overlap of the crosscaps with the localized brane , the @xmath17-twisted characters of the superconformal algebra are obtained in the open string channel .",
    "we give a closed string orientifold description of the different crosscaps by computing the klein - bottle amplitudes .",
    "some technical details regarding the amplitudes are collected in the appendices .",
    "crosscap states in the cigar background have already been studied in detail in a  continuum limit \" @xcite .",
    "however , for our purposes , it is necessary to require integral @xmath18 charges so as to be able to gso project .    in section [ flip ] , we use these crosscaps along with the boundary states described in @xcite to engineer a @xmath15 gauge theory in four dimensions with flavours in the fundamental representation .",
    "we study how electric - magnetic or seiberg duality is realized in the gauge theory from a worldsheet perspective , following the ideas in @xcite .",
    "this involves understanding how boundary states and crosscaps behave under a monodromy in the closed string parameter space .",
    "we find that within the context of a smooth superstring background , our results realize the results obtained in the geometric type iia set - up involving d@xmath19 branes and ns@xmath6 branes @xcite and are consistent with field theory expectations .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "when tackling the exact description of seiberg duality in the double scaling limit , it will be useful to keep in mind the bulk configuration before taking the limit .",
    "we review briefly how seiberg duality was analyzed by studying the low energy theory on d@xmath19 branes suspended between the ns@xmath6 branes in type iia string theory .",
    "the realization of seiberg duality in this brane set up has been discussed in detail in the literature @xcite . as we will show , some aspects of this description of seiberg duality are closely related to our worldsheet discussion .",
    "we begin with the electric set - up as shown in figure [ orient4 ] .",
    "we have shown the position of the various objects in the @xmath20 direction .",
    "the o@xmath19 plane extends all along the @xmath20 direction .",
    "note that when the o@xmath19 plane crosses an ns@xmath6 brane , it goes from the positively charged @xmath21 type to the negatively charged @xmath22 type .",
    "colour d4-branes and @xmath23 flavour d4-branes ending on d6-branes .",
    "[ orient4 ] ]    flavour is realized by d@xmath24 branes to the right of the ns brane as shown in figure [ orient4 ] .",
    "since the low - energy gauge theory physics is independent of the position of the d@xmath24 brane , one can also take the limit when it is at infinity .",
    "this limit has an interesting relation to the geometric engineering of gauge theories using d@xmath24 branes wrapped on the @xmath25-sphere @xcite in the deformed conifold .",
    "seiberg duality in that context was implemented by the so - called @xmath26transition .",
    "the deformed conifold is defined as the zero locus @xmath27 the @xmath26transition amounts to the operation @xmath28 . in the absence of flavour branes , such transitions have been studied in detail in @xcite by lifting the brane and orientifolds to m - theory following earlier work in @xcite .",
    "now the ns@xmath6 brane configuration we started with is related to the geometric set - up by t - dualities @xcite .",
    "it is known that the closed string parameter @xmath29 of the conifold maps to the relative position of the ns and ns branes .",
    "electric - magnetic duality is therefore implemented in the iia brane set - up by exchanging the positions of the ns and ns along the @xmath20 direction .",
    "the presence of the orientifold implies that we necessarily pass through a strong coupling region in order to implement seiberg duality @xcite .    in order to derive the magnetic configuration ,",
    "one uses the fact that a certain linking number @xcite must be conserved in the duality transition . for the ns@xmath6 brane",
    ", the linking number is defined for each ns@xmath6-brane as @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) refer to the number of branes of type @xmath33 to the right ( left ) of the ns@xmath6 brane .",
    "for the electric configuration , which leads to a @xmath34 theory with @xmath23 flavours , the linking number for the ns brane is equal to @xmath35 we count charges such that @xmath36 d@xmath19 branes lead to a colour group of @xmath34 .",

    "[ orient4magn ] ]    note that we are forced to include an additional @xmath19 d@xmath19 branes in order to leave invariant the linking number .",
    "one can check that this brane configuration has the correct properties of the seiberg dual gauge theory , including the presence of the @xmath37 mesonic fields ( the fluctuation of the @xmath38 branes stretched between the ns and d@xmath24 ) and the superpotential term @xmath39 .",
    "it is the equality of the linking number in the electric and magnetic configurations that forces us to include the @xmath19 extra d@xmath19 branes that realize the colour gauge theory .",
    "it is not possible to derive the generation of the @xmath19 extra d@xmath19 branes in this semi - classical brane set - up .",
    "see however @xcite for a derivation of this phenomenon from a strong coupling analysis .",
    "our analysis of the iia brane set - ups has been brief as these set - ups are fairly well studied in the literature .",
    "we now turn to describing the bulk geometry and the associated branes exactly in terms of conformal field theory , in a suitable limit of the ns@xmath6 brane background .",
    "for type iia strings on the deformed conifold , one can define a double scaling limit @xmath40 the mass of the d - branes that wrap the three - sphere remains finite . in this limit",

    "we note in passing that the relation between d - branes in ns@xmath6 backgrounds and the geometric engineering of gauge theories using branes on the deformed conifold , that was mentioned earlier , is consistent with this conjecture .",
    "the topological sub - sector of the cft has been matched to the topological sector of the deformed conifold theory for both closed strings @xcite and open strings @xcite .",
    "one can realize sqcd like theories in this set - up by introducing @xmath36 d3-branes localized at the tip of the cigar associated to an @xmath43 gauge group @xcite and @xmath23 double - sheeted d5-branes filling the whole of space - time that introduce @xmath23 flavors into the gauge theory @xcite .",
    "we next turn to a detailed discussion of the crosscaps and boundary states in this background that will allow us to understand seiberg duality from a worldsheet perspective .      in @xcite",
    "it was argued that a sign flip of the cigar bulk interaction coefficient @xmath29 leads to an exact conformal field theory realization of seiberg duality for @xmath43 gauge theories .",
    "we recall that from the cylinder amplitudes for these branes , one could derive the one - point functions via a modular bootstrap procedure @xcite . in this way one could associate to characters of the @xmath44 superconformal algebra ( labeled by @xmath45 , functions of the conformal dimension and r - charge ) particular cardy boundary states .",
    "a further crucial ingredient in @xcite was the addition relation : latexmath:[\\[\\label{dddiff }    exact boundary states .",
    "this is a consequence of an @xmath44 superconformal algebra character identity at level @xmath42 , relating the @xmath47 continuous character , with the @xmath48 continuous character and the identity character .",
    "we briefly recall a few annulus amplitudes for d - branes in the background , as discussed in @xcite . by a @xmath49 brane in the background ,",
    "we mean a d - brane that fills @xmath50 that is tensored with the identity brane in the cigar direction .",
    "we denote the corresponding boundary state as @xmath51 as above .",
    "similarly , a @xmath52 brane fills @xmath50 and is tensored with a brane labeled by the continuous representation @xmath53 .",
    "we mostly focus on the branes with @xmath54 and @xmath55 and will neglect the @xmath56 eigenvalue .    the modular bootstrap is implemented by requiring that only the identity character appears in the self - overlap of the @xmath49 brane while the continuous character appears in the overlap of the @xmath49 and the @xmath52 branes . in",
    "what follows , we will use the notation @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the open and closed string channel moduli . in the open string channel",

    "all three boundary states are therefore mutually supersymmetric .    from the identity in",
    ", we see that from the difference of and , one obtains the d@xmath25 self - overlap .",
    "indeed , the @xmath61 representation of the @xmath44 superconformal algebra is reducible . using the modular bootstrap method",
    ", one can modular transform the annulus amplitude into the closed string channel and read off the d@xmath25 and d@xmath6 brane wavefunctions for both @xmath61 and @xmath59 .",
    "this has been done in @xcite and we record the ns sector wavefunctions below - dependent phase factor in all wavefunctions ( both for the boundary states and the crosscaps to follow ) .",
    "we will come back to this point in section @xmath19 . ] : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "similar expressions also exist for the rr sectors that can be easily obtained from the expression above by spectral flow @xmath66 .      to construct crosscap states , we proceed in analogy with the boundary states .",
    "we will perform a modular bootstrap procedure for the mbius amplitudes for the supercoset conformal field theory at level @xmath42 .",
    "it is clear how to generalize our analysis to other levels , but we will not need the generalization for the applications in this paper",
    ". our starting point will be the requirement that our crosscap states have an overlap with the identity d@xmath25-brane which is an @xmath17-twisted @xmath44 superconformal character ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "we then use the open - closed duality of the mbius amplitudes and our knowledge of the d@xmath25-brane boundary state to derive corresponding crosscap states .",
    "afterwards , we will interpret the crosscap states in terms of orientifolds of the bulk superstring theory by computing the klein - bottle amplitudes .",
    "twisting ordinary @xmath44 superconformal characters in the open string channel by @xmath17 can be implemented by the substitution @xmath67 in the untwisted characters @xmath68 .",
    "one obtains the twisted characters @xmath69 that take into account the action of @xmath17 on the fermionic oscillators . the full mbius amplitude that corresponds to the overlap of the crosscap state labeled by the @xmath59 continuous character with the d@xmath25 brane ( and vice versa )",
    "is then given by @xmath70 \\,.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the mbius amplitude for the overlap of the @xmath61 crosscap state with the d@xmath25 brane can similarly be written as ensures that the small @xmath71 expansion of the characters begins with a real number . ]",
    "@xmath72\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] using the same theta function identities that were used to show the vanishing of the d@xmath6-d@xmath25 overlap ( for @xmath73 ) , we see that both the overlaps vanish .",
    "thus both these crosscap states are supersymmetric with respect to the d@xmath25 brane .",
    "similar to the d - brane boundary states , we define the crosscap state corresponding to the @xmath17-twisted identity character as the difference between the @xmath61 and @xmath59 crosscap state .",
    "let us now execute the modular bootstrap and determine the closed string one - point functions explicitly .",
    "modular transforming the first term of the @xmath59 mbius amplitude into the closed string channel , and using that the closed string and open string channel parameters are now related by @xmath74 , we get @xmath75 the details of the modular transformation are given in the appendix . for the @xmath61 mbius amplitude in equation ,",
    "the @xmath76 factor is first transformed into @xmath77 for the ns sector , we get for the @xmath61 mbius amplitude @xmath78 following the modular bootstrap approach that led to the boundary states , one can use the results for the d - brane wavefunctions in equation to derive the wavefunctions for the crosscap states .",
    "let us begin with the @xmath59 overlap in equation : expanding the theta - function @xmath79 as we did before , we get @xmath80 this should be rewritten in terms of the closed string wavefunctions as @xmath81 here , the @xmath17-twisted character @xmath82 is given by a twisted overlap of the ishibashi states @xmath83 note that in the overlap , only the even winding modes @xmath84 appear .",
    "the crosscap state can therefore be written as a linear combination of ishibashi states with even winding : @xmath85 let us now consider the open string contribution in the rr sector .",
    "similar manipulations yield that the crosscap state is a sum of only those ishibashi states with odd winding modes @xmath86    a similar exercise can be carried out for the @xmath61 crosscap state .",
    "the wavefunctions take the form @xmath87 thus , in the nsns sector , we find that the @xmath61 crosscap has only odd winding modes while the rr sector wavefunctions have even winding modes .",
    "a crosscap state that has a consistent projection in the open string channel on the identity character is the identity crosscap state , whose overlap with the d@xmath25 gives the twisted identity character .",
    "its wavefunction is just the difference of the @xmath61 and @xmath59 crosscap states in equations and .",
    "we will use this crosscap state to engineer our @xmath15 gauge theory in the electric set - up .",

    "this point will be crucial later on when we engineer the gauge theories of interest and we will come back to this point shortly , but we first give a closed string interpretation of these crosscap states in terms of projection operators .      *",

    "the @xmath14 gauge group is realized by taking the opposite ( overall ) sign of the orientifold plane .",
    "we can confirm the above picture as follows . from the ratio of one - point functions for the rr scalar , we can read of the charge of the crosscap state relative to the charge of the d5-brane .",

    "we note in passing that for the gauge theory without flavours , we can argue following @xcite that the breaking of the anomalous @xmath18 is encoded in the backreaction of the d3-branes _ and _ the orientifold plane on the rr - scalar .",

    "the @xmath59 brane does not have any massless localized modes in an overlap with either of the crosscaps .",

    "these are chiral superfields @xmath141 which fall into the vector representation of @xmath132 .",
    "the theory on the worldvolume of the branes at low energies is thus a four - dimensional @xmath132 gauge theory with @xmath127 quarks , which has @xmath133 supersymmetry .    from the d@xmath6 mbius amplitudes",
    ", we also read off that the global symmetry group is indeed @xmath142 .",
    "this can be seen as follows : while the massless d3-brane spectrum is projected by both the @xmath61 and the @xmath88 crosscap , the d5-brane massless spectrum is only affected in the open string channel by the non - compact @xmath88 crosscap .",
    "this can be checked by expanding the mbius amplitudes for the d5-brane with the @xmath61 crosscap and finding only massive modes in the open string channel ( see equations ( [ jzerocrossd5half1 ] , [ jzerocrossd5half2 ] , [ jzerocrossd5half3 ] ) ) . moreover , by expanding the mbius amplitudes that project the massless modes in the open string channel for the d3-brane ( see subsection [ crossd3 ] ) compared to the d5-brane ( see subsection [ crossd5 ] ) , we see that the mbius amplitudes have a relative minus sign . this can be traced back to the relative sign in the full orientifold that corresponds to subtraction of the @xmath61 and the @xmath88 crosscaps ( plus the fact that the main contribution to the d3-brane mbius amplitude is from the @xmath61 crosscap ) .",
    "the relative minus sign between the d@xmath25 and d@xmath6 mbius amplitudes codes the fact that the global symmetry group is @xmath14 when the gauge group is @xmath13 ( and vice versa ) .",

[ [ worldsheet - analysis - of - mu - transitions - and - the - magnetic - theory ] ] worldsheet analysis of @xmath26transitions and the magnetic theory ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    now that we have identified the relevant boundary states and crosscaps , we can proceed , following @xcite , to infer seiberg duality from the worldsheet . in",
    "what follows , we use the known transformations of the d - brane states under the @xmath29-flip transformation @xmath28 , the consequent rearrangement of the d - branes in the charge lattice , mutual supersymmetry with the final @xmath29-flipped configuration as well as some physical statements about tensions to infer the behaviour of the crosscap states under the @xmath26flip .",
    "we first review the transformation of the boundary states following .",
    "since most of the details can be found in @xcite , we will be brief in our discussion .",
    "[ [ behaviour - of - boundary - states - and - crosscaps - under - mu - transitions ] ] behaviour of boundary states and crosscaps under @xmath26transitions ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    the behavior of the d3 and d5-brane boundary states under a sign - flip of the coefficient @xmath29 of the cigar interaction term ( i.e. the n=2 liouville interaction term corresponding to a winding condensate ) was determined in @xcite .",
    "the first ingredient in the derivation is the fact that the bulk vertex operators satisfy a reflection relation , and therefore their one - point functions satisfy it as well @xcite .",
    "this determines the @xmath29 dependence of the one - point functions for the boundary states , as well as the crosscap states .",
    "the @xmath29-dependence of the closed string one - point functions in the nsns sector amounts to an overall factor of @xmath143 where @xmath97 is the momentum of the closed string , and @xmath144 is the ( worldsheet left - moving ) @xmath18 charge of the closed string vertex operator .",
    "we recall that d3-branes are localized objects with a well - defined mass .",
    "the gravitational backreaction is dominantly on the on - shell mode with asymptotic behaviour @xmath145 , @xmath146 being the radial direction of the cigar @xcite . under @xmath147 ,",
    "the one - point function for this mode flips sign .",
    "that shows that the nsns part of the d3-brane boundary state needs to pick up an explicit minus sign , when we demand that it maps into a physical d - brane with positive mass @xcite .    for the nsns part of the d5-brane boundary state , the dominant backreaction is onto the cosmological constant , which does not pick up a minus sign under the @xmath147 transformation .",
    "moreover , since the d5-brane changes orientation under the @xmath148 transformation @xcite , the rr part of the boundary state flips sign .",
    "charge conservation then fixes that the d3-brane rr boundary state flips sign as well ( leading to a simple overall minus sign in the boundary state ) .",
    "thus , under the @xmath148 transformation , we have the following transformation of the boundary states @xcite : @xmath149 after the annihilation of the @xmath36 d3-branes with @xmath23 anti - d3-branes ( for @xmath150 ) , we remain with @xmath151 color anti - branes , as well as @xmath23 mutually supersymmetric flavor branes ( at @xmath61 ) .",
    "thus , on the magnetic side , the colour gauge theory is realized on @xmath151 branes of the form @xmath152 .",
    "we now turn to the determination of the behaviour of the crosscap states under the @xmath148 transformation . our attitude will be slightly different than in the d - brane case .",
    "we will only attempt to describe the final configuration that results after the system has fully relaxed to the supersymmetric configuration . to that end",
    ", we would like to understand the crosscaps which are supersymmetric with respect to the final configuration of d - branes above in the magnetic theory at @xmath153 .",
    "mutual supersymmetry with the branes @xmath152 and @xmath154 dictates that the relative sign of the nsns and rr parts of the crosscap states change ( as for the d - branes ) when we go from @xmath155 .",
    "moreoever from the pure bulk theory before double scaling , we know that the exchange of the ns5 and ns5 branes before any d - branes are present is a trivial operation . that remains true in the presence of the orientifold plane , so the klein - bottle amplitude does not change under the @xmath29-flip .",
    "we further expect that the gauge theory which is realized on the localized branes is projected onto an so group as before .",
    "this projection arises from a mbius amplitude which is an overlap of the new crosscap with the localized branes in the magnetic theory @xmath156 .",
    "these conditions fix the transformation of the crosscap : latexmath:[\\ ] ] note that in the @xmath90-channel the density of states is a delta function as a result of which there is no integral over the momenta in the radial direction of the cigar .",
    "thus , the self overlap is regular as @xmath114 and vanishes because of the identity ( in the @xmath222-channel ) @xmath223      n.  seiberg , `` electric - magnetic duality in supersymmetric nonabelian gauge theories , '' nucl .",
