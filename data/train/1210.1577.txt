    "high energy heavy ion collisions provide a unique opportunity to investigate the properties of nuclear matter at high energy density , a few gev/@xmath2 , which is several times the energy density of a proton . at these temperatures , @xmath3 mev ,",
    "matter undergoes a transition between the hadronic phase and the quark - gluon plasma phase ( qgp ) @xcite . in the prevailing view , the strongly interacting matter validates the use of thermodynamics @xcite to describe the chemistry and hydrodynamics @xcite to describe the evolution .",
    "a typical assumption is that the hadronic chemistry is described by chemical freeze - out at a single temperature .",
    "this temperature is also associated with the qgp - hadron transition , or hadronization .",
    "although hadrons certainly collide a few more times after hadronization , many models typically ignore the effects of hadronic - stage interactions on the chemistry .",
    "particle ratios are often fit by a single temperature and a few chemical potentials to account for non - zero conserved charges such as strangeness , baryon number and electric charge .",
    "additionally , fugacities have been added to account for the inability of the system to produce the requisite number of up , down and strange quarks for equilibrium @xcite .",
    "these pictures are usually based on the idea that , due to the strong interactions between quarks , all partitions into various hadron species are thermally sampled during hadronization , and that the evolution of chemical abundances after hadronization comes only from decays",
    ". however , the inferred temperature could be misleading if chemical reactions during the hadronization stage significantly change particle ratios .",
    "of course , the chemical make - up does not completely freeze - out  hadrons indeed undergo chemical reactions during the hadronic stage .",
    "the effects of such evolution have been studied in two contexts . first , hadronic cascades ( microscopic simulations that follow the trajectories of individual hadrons ) such as urqmd @xcite include inelastic processes .",
    "although these models include annihilation processes , e.g. , @xmath4 @xcite , few microscopic models have included the regeneration processes and therefore violate detailed balance .",
    "inverse processes have been added to the hadronic hsd model , where @xmath5 processes such as @xmath6 are included self consistently @xcite .",
    "concomittantly , @xmath5 processes have also been incorporated into partonic simulations @xcite .",
    "the particular process , @xmath7 , allows an annihilation to ultimately produce 5 mesons after the @xmath8 mesons decay .",
    "these incorporations into the hsd model have been used to investigate the possibility of creating the observed number of antibaryons through bottom - up processes , mostly at sps , ags and sis energies . at higher energies ,",
    "if one assumes that a chemically equilibrated number of baryons and antibaryons are created at hadronization , the issue becomes one of whether the regeneration process significantly dampens the annihilation rate during the hadronic stage .",
    "implementing regeneration into cascade codes , as was done in hsd , requires significant investment , both in development and in the numerical cost of running more complicated codes .",
    "a second class of approaches involves solving for the chemical rates of a kinetically equilibrated gas .",
    "given that there are hundreds of resonances , such models typically assign fugacities to a few numbers such as effective pion number , or the net number of baryons plus antibaryons , and then solve for the evolution of the fugacities @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that regeneration rates , e.g. @xmath9 , were important .",
    "related issues were pursued by considering regeneration through hagedorn states in @xcite , where it was estimated that chemical equilibration times were only fast enough to maintain equilibrium for temperatures @xmath10 170 mev .",
    "chemical evolution was superimposed onto a hydrodynamic calculation in @xcite , where regeneration processes were included in a matter consistent with reproducing chemical equilibrium . in their results , annihilation and regeneration reduced baryon yields by 15 - 20% .    in all the calculations mentioned above",
    ", it is assumed that chemical equilibrium is maintained until some point , and that this temperature is sufficiently low that the system can be approximated as a hadron gas .",
    "this temperature , which we will label @xmath11 , is sometimes associated with the hadronization temperature , though that is not necessary .",
    "inferred temperatures near 170 mev are common , even though the density of a hadron gas at such temperatures would suggest densities of one hadron per @xmath12 , which is roughly the inverse volume of a hadron . further , lattice calculations show that the system is undergoing significant changes already by that time . the scalar quark condensate and the polyakov loop",
    "are already significantly changed relative to vacuum values for temperatures @xmath13 mev @xcite .",
    "fluctuations of conserved charges measured on the lattice show that hadron - like states exist up to somewhat higher temperatures , @xmath14 mev @xcitebazavov:2013dta .",
    "we proceed here with calculations assuming @xmath15 mev , even though hadrons at this temperature may have a rather different character than those in the vacuum .",
    "the shape of pion , kaon and proton spectra can be well described by hybrid hydrodynamic / cascade models that assume chemical equilibrium at the hadronization temperature , and ignore any subsequent chemical evolution beyond resonance decays and reformation @xcite .",
    "however , such model s proton / pion ratio tends to significantly differ from experimental measurements from the phenix collaboration at rhic and from the alice collaboration at the lhc .",
    "phenix ratios @xcite were @xmath16% below hybrid model predictions that fit the yields of pions and kaons in @xcite where baryon annihilations had been neglected .",
    "more consistent shortcomings are seen in pb+pb collisions at the lhc measured by alice @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 ratio is nearly half of what one would expect from freezeout at hadronization temperatures @xcite , and are @xmath17 lower than the hydrodynamic results in @xcite . using a microscopic model , a reduction of approximately this size",
    "was seen @xcite and in the erratum to @xcite , but those calculations ignore the inverse rates , which according to @xcite largely cancel the annihilation rates . in @xcite ,",
    "the inverse process was crudely estimated at the level of 8% , with this value then being used to represent the error associated with the lack of detailed balance in their model .",
    "the principal goal of this paper is to solve for the chemical rates of a wide range of hadronic species where baryon annihilation and regeneration are treated in a manner consistent with detailed balance , and to understand the relative importance of annihilation and regeneration .",
    "this is similar in spirit to what was outlined in @xcite and performed in @xcite , but in more detail and with a larger number of resonances considered .",
    "the chemical evolution is also followed until interactions fully cease .",
    "we will determine whether in a consistent calculation annihilations might account for a @xmath18% reduction in the final - state @xmath1 ratio measured in heavy - ion collisions at high energy relative to the final - state ration calculated without annihilation processes .",
    "further , we discuss the importance of accounting for baryon annihilations when estimating the chemical freeze - out temperature from final - state yields . as a secondary goal , we wish to see whether strange baryons are affected at the same level .    in order to concentrate on chemistry",
    ", we employ a simplified model of the space - time evolution .",
    "we consider the evolution of a single hydrodynamic cell , where the volume changes as a function of time according to a simple prescription .",
    "the parameterization is based on the one - dimensional bjorken expansion @xcite , but is modified to account for transverse expansion .",
    "the parameterization is chosen to roughly match what happens in a three - dimensional hydrodynamic calculation of a central pb+pb collision at the lhc . in a more realistic model",
    ", one would consider the whole ensemble of hydrodynamic cells , each of which would evolve differently .",
    "various species lose local kinetic equilibrium with one another when temperatures approach 140 mev , as heavier species like protons cool faster than pions @xcite .",
    "additionally , pions would begin to flow with different velocities , and leave the collision region while the embers would become relatively more baryon rich @xcite .",
    "accounting for these non - equilibrium aspects requires microscopic simulations .",
    "nonetheless , this picture should be adequate to gauge the significance of annihilation and regeneration .",
    "we model the hadronic stage by first assuming that all resonances are initially populated according to chemical equilibrium with a temperature @xmath11 , set by default to 170 mev , which is in the neighborhood of where hadronization takes place .",
    "all chemical potentials are set to zero .",
    "the list of 319 resonances taken from the particle data book @xcite extends to masses up to 2.25 gev .",
    "although one should have a non - zero baryonic chemical potential , even at high rhic and lhc energies , it will be ignored for this study given that the our goal is to gauge the importance of annihilation effects .",
    "after the initial time , we assume that collisions are sufficiently frequent to preserve local kinetic equilibrium , even though inelastic collisions are insufficient for maintaining chemical equilibrium . each species is assigned a chemical potential , @xmath19 . each @xmath19",
    "is initially set to zero , and if chemical equilibrium were maintained each @xmath19 would remain zero . ignoring bose effects , which are a @xmath20 correction for pions , thermal results within the context of the grand canonical ensemble for number densities , pressure ,",

    "the chemical potentials , @xmath19 , are zero . for a system of massless particles in an isentropic expansion ,",
    "the yields can be frozen and @xmath19 will remain zero .",
    "however , for massive particles the chemical potentials become positive if yields are frozen .",
    "this can be understood by considering the fact that the entropy per particle with zero chemical potential is near 3.5 for massless particles , but increases as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "even pions , the lightest mesons , develop significantly positive chemical potentials if the chemical evolution is frozen or if the evolution is confined to decays @xcite .",
    "as will be seen later in this paper , chemical potentials remain positive even after decays , e.g. @xmath30 , and annihilations , e.g. @xmath31 are included .",
    "baryon annihilation reduces baryon chemical potentials , but again are insufficiently fast to maintain equilibrium .    to return the pion chemical potential to zero",
    ", pion absorbing processes , e.g. @xmath32 , are required .",
    "due to conservation of g - parity , there are only a few reactions in the meson sector that can reduce the final number of pions relative to the number one would get from decays alone .",
    "for example , @xmath33 violates g - parity .",
    "reactions such as @xmath34 or @xmath35 conserve g - parity but are fairly rare .",
    "the baryon sector is a better candidate for affecting the final pion number since g - parity is not a constraint for reactions involving baryons .",
    "for instance @xmath36 lowers the final pion number by one .",
    "such reactions might well reduce the final - state number of pions at the 5 - 10% level . as will be shown here ,",
    "pions become overpopulated by a factor @xmath37 when the temperature has cooled to approximately 100 mev . thus , pion - absorbing reactions are far from able to maintain equilibrium , but they might also be non - negligible since chemical yields are now being evaluated at the 10% level .",
    "baryons comprise only @xmath38 of final - state hadrons at the lhc or at the highest rhic energies , but represent a much higher fraction of the hadrons at sps energies .",
    "although such pion - absorbing processes are not considered here , they deserve further study , especially for analyses of lower - energy collisions .",
    "since we are interested in simply gauging the effects of annihilation , we consider a simplified picture of the expansion . in a one - dimensional boost - invariant expansion @xcite ,",
    "the volume of a fluid element would increase proportional to the time @xmath39 .",
    "however , such a picture neglects transverse expansion . to crudely account for transverse expansion , we assume that the volume of the element increases as @xmath40 for times @xmath39 greater than the hadronization time @xmath41 . by viewing the evolution of the density and temperature of hydrodynamic expansions from @xcite , the parameters were chosen to be :",
    "@xmath42 fm/@xmath43 , @xmath44 fm/@xmath43 .",
    "this parameterization produced density vs. time curves that were similar to those seen in full hydrodynamic models .",
    "based on the assumption above , the continuity equations can be easily be solved in bjorken coordinates should all chemical rates be turned off , @xmath45 the evolution equations for the chemistry are modified in the presence of chemical rates , @xmath46=\\omega(\\tau ) r_i(\\tau),\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is net production / annihilation rate per unit @xmath48 of particles of species @xmath24 .",
    "the net rates , @xmath47 , are all zero at equilibrium , but as the system cools the system loses equilibrium and the rates become non - zero ( usually negative ) to push toward equilibrium .",

    "thus , given the rates @xmath47 , eq.s ( [ eq : dndtau]-[eq : dsdtau ] ) allow one to solve for the evolution of the number and entropy densities , or equivalently the chemical potentials and temperatures , as a function of @xmath39 .",
    "a multidimensional newton s method is used to numerically determine @xmath19 and @xmath50 from @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",

    "other inelastic processes , e.g. , @xmath70 , are ignored for this study as we are focusing on baryons .",
    "such processes can change @xmath71 at the level of 10% @xcite .",
    "experimental data show that the most likely number of pions in @xmath72 is @xmath73 , and to simplify the calculation we assume that all annihilations proceed through the @xmath74 production channel . for pair annihilation with nonzero strangeness ,",
    "we employ the minimal rule for kaon production , i.e , the number of kaons in the final state equals the initial strangeness .",
    "for example , if the initial strangeness is unity , then final production of annihilation will have one kaon .",
    "we still assume final production has five particles on average .",

    "this may explain part of the reason why in @xcite only 15 - 20% of the baryons were annihilated , while in this calculation the rate was closer to 40% .",
    "a common use of particle ratios is to determine the chemical freeze - out temperature .",

    "this would increase the @xmath118 ratio .",
    "in contrast , the process @xmath119 prefers to reduce the number of strange quarks and reduce the @xmath118 ratio .",

    "this helps explain the magnitude of the @xmath84 and @xmath121 spectra at the lhc relative to the pion spectra without surrendering the assumption of chemical equilibrium at the advent of the hadronic stage .",
    "figure [ fig : alldens ] also displays results from calculations where the inverse reactions , e.g. @xmath0 , were not included . in this case",
    "baryon yields would have fallen approximately 50% if regeneration had not been incorporated .",
    "this is consistent with microscopic transport models that also ignore regeneration @xcite .",
    "regeneration increases this reduced yield by about 20% so that the net reduction in baryon number is close to 40% .",

    "thus , this simple calculation mainly serves as a means to gauge whether regeneration , which requires significant work to implement in a microscopic model , warrants the effort to incorporate into microscopic models .",
    "the answer is `` yes '' , if one wants to understand baryon yields to the 10% level or better , but `` no '' if 20% accuracy is sufficient . it is also clear that baryon annihilation can not be ignored even if 20% accuracy is sufficient . even after regeneration is included , the annihilation fraction is in the neighborhood of 40% .",
    "figure [ fig : alldens ] also showed the effect of annihilation on strange baryon yields .",
    "however , these results are not trustworthy given the lack of knowledge of annihilation cross sections for hyperons .",
    "whereas the nucleon - antinucleon cross sections do not strongly depend on isospin , e.g. @xmath105 and @xmath104 annihilation cross sections are similar @xcite , little is known about the annihilation cross sections for hyperons , either with antinucleons or antihyperons , and one must resort to unconstrained model calculations @xcite or to fits to particle yields in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "additionally , it is possible that @xmath124 inelastic processes such as @xmath125 , which are not included here , might affect yields . in our calculations @xmath126 , so such effects might alter the @xmath118 ratio .",
    "any study of hyperon yields in heavy ion collisions will remain largely speculative until experimental information is obtained regarding hyperon annihilation reactions in the vacuum .",
    "the analysis of this paper , and of similar works , would significantly benefit if the details of how yields were measured was clearly provided .",
    "this is especially true for understanding the degree to which weak resonance decays are included in experimental results , especially preliminary results .",
    "for example , at the 10% level ratios of baryon yields to pions depend on whether weak decays , e.g. @xmath127 , that produce pions are included .",
    "presentations of model results are often similarly vague in their description .",
    "all weak decays were consistently ignored in the calculations presented here , but that can easily be modified to better either match experimental conditions or to match the choices of a competing theoretical model .",
    "although sufficient for obtaining an understanding of the importance of annihilation chemistry during the hadronic stage , the model employed here is too simplistic to compare to data at better than the 10% level .",
    "the assumptions are numerous : hadronic equilibrium at the onset of hadronization , boost - invariant dynamics , and local kinetic equilibrium that persists for long times .",
    "further , some of the chemistry is neglected .",
    "inelastic collisions , such as @xmath36 , can lower the final meson yields on the order of 10% . as shown here , to make a hadronic cascade reliable to the 10% level , one should employ a fully consistent microscopic simulation of the hadronic stage that includes regeneration . the cascade would then account for the three - dimensional expansion , include more @xmath115 processes , provide a realistic freeze - out picture , and allow for the loss of local kinetic equilibrium .",

    "<S> the role of baryon - antibaryon annihilation during the hadronic stage of a relativistic heavy ion collision is explored by simulating the chemical evolution of a hadron gas . beginning with a chemically equilibrated gas at an initial temperature of 170 mev </S>",
    "<S> , the chemical composition of a representative hydrodynamic cell is followed throughout the hadronic stage . the cell s volume changes with time according to a parameterization that mimics a three - dimensional hydrodynamic expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical evolution includes both annihilation and regeneration of baryons , consistent with detailed balance . during the hadronic stage , </S>",
    "<S> the number of baryons drops by approximately 40% for the case where there is no net baryonic charge . </S>",
    "<S> when the calculations are performed without the baryon regenerating processes , e.g. @xmath0 , the loss of baryons was found to be closer to 50% . </S>",
    "<S> after accounting for annihilation , yields are consistent with measurements from the alice collaboration at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> baryon annihilation is shown to alter the extracted chemical breakup temperature by significantly changing the @xmath1 ratio . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that annihilation cross sections are independent of the strangeness and isospin of the annihilating baryon and anti - baryon , the loss of strange baryons from annihilation is found to be similar . </S>"
