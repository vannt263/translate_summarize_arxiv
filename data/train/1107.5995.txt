    "in this paper we present the inverse scattering approach , based on an appropriate riemann  hilbert problem formulation , for the initial value problem for the degasperis - procesi ( dp ) equation @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a positive parameter .",
    "the dp equation arises as a model equation describing the shallow - water approximation in inviscid hydrodynamics in the so - called `` moderate amplitude regime '' : introducing two small parameters , the wave - amplitude parameter @xmath3 ( characterizing the smallness of the wave amplitude ) and the long - wave parameter @xmath4 ( characterizing the smallness of the typical wavelength with respect to the water depth ) , in this regime we assume that @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this regime can be characterized as to be more nonlinear than dispersive , which , in particular , allows `` wave breaking '' .",
    "this is in contrast with the so - called `` shallow water regime '' ( @xmath5 and @xmath7 ) , where nonlinearity and dispersion are so balanced that the solution of the initial value problem for the associated nonlinear equation ( the korteweg  de vries equation ) exists globally for all times , for all `` nice '' ( sufficiently decaying and smooth ) initial data .    among the models of moderate amplitude regime , only two are integrable ( admitting a bi - hamiltonian structure and a lax pair representation ) : they are the camassa ",
    "holm ( ch ) equation and the dp equation .",
    "also , they are the only two integrable equations from the `` @xmath8-family '' of equations @xmath9 the ch and dp equations correspond to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .    the analysis of the ch equation by using the inverse scattering approach was started in @xcite .",
    "a version of the inverse scattering method based on the riemann ",
    "hilbert ( rh ) factorization problem was proposed in @xcite ( another riemann ",
    "hilbert formulation of the inverse scattering transform is presented in @xcite ) .",
    "the rh approach has proved its efficiency in the study of the long - time behavior of solutions of both initial value problems @xcite and initial boundary value problems @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we develop the riemann ",
    "hilbert approach to the dp equation , following the main ideas developed in @xcite .    a major difference between the implementations of the riemann  hilbert method to the ch equation and",
    "the dp equation is that in the latter case , the spatial equation of the lax pair is of the third order , which implies that in the matrix form one has to deal with @xmath12 matrix - valued equations , while in the case of the ch equation , they have a @xmath13 matrix structure , as in the cases of the most known integrable equations ( kdv , modified kdv , nonlinear schrdinger , sine ",
    "gordon , etc . )",
    "hence , the construction and analysis of the associated rh problem become considerably more complicated .    in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "the inverse scattering method for the dp equation based on a @xmath12 matrix rh problem in the spectral @xmath14-plane is proposed , where the solution of the dp equation is extracted from the large-@xmath14 behavior of the solution of the rh problem .",
    "also , the dressing procedure is given for constructing @xmath15-soliton solutions , which is illustrated , particularly , by the explicit construction ( in parametric form ) of the @xmath16-soliton solutions .    in our approach",
    ", we propose a different riemann  hilbert problem and give a different representation of the solution @xmath17 of the initial value problem in terms of the solution of this rh problem evaluated at a distinguished point of the plane of the spectral parameter .",
    "remarkably , the formulae for @xmath17 have the same structure as the parametric formulae for pure multisoliton solutions obtained in @xcite .",
    "we assume that the initial function @xmath18 in is sufficiently smooth and decay fast as @xmath19 .",
    "letting @xmath17 be the solution of the dp equation , we introduce the `` momentum '' variable @xmath20 it is known that , similarly to the case of the ch equation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the condition @xmath21 for all @xmath22 provides the existence of @xmath23 for all @xmath24 ; moreover , @xmath25 for all @xmath26 and all @xmath27 .",
    "this justifies the form @xmath28{m+\\omega}\\right)_t=- \\left(u \\sqrt[3]{m+\\omega}\\right)_x\\ ] ] of the dp equation , which will be used in our constructions below .",
    "the linear dispersion parameter @xmath2 can be scaled out to @xmath29 .",
    "hence , in what follows , for simplicity , we assume @xmath29 .        the dp equation admits a lax representation : this equation is actually the compatibility condition of two linear equations @xcite    [ lax - ini ] @xmath30    where @xmath31 is a spectral parameter , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is an arbitrary constant . in what follows we will see that it is convenient to choose @xmath34 .      in order to control the behavior of solutions to as functions of the spectral parameter @xmath31 ( which is crucial for the riemann",
    "hilbert method ) , it is convenient to rewrite the lax pair in matrix form . introducing @xmath35 by @xmath36 transforms the scalar lax pair into a lax pair    [ lax - vec ] @xmath37 where @xmath38 with @xmath39    from now on , will be seen as a @xmath12 matrix - valued linear system : a `` matrix '' solution of is a collection @xmath40 of three `` vector '' solutions @xmath41 .",
    "now we notice that if @xmath34 , then @xmath42 is traceless .",
    "thus in this case the determinant of a matrix solution to the equation @xmath43 is independent of @xmath24 .",
    "the analogous property of @xmath44 is obvious .",
    "the coefficient matrices @xmath45 and @xmath42 in have singularities ( in the extended complex @xmath31-plane ) at @xmath46 and at @xmath47 . in order to control the large-@xmath31 behavior of solutions of",
    ", we follow a strategy similar to that adopted for the ch equation @xcite .",
    "we transform in such a way that :    a.   the leading terms for @xmath48 in the lax equations be diagonal , whereas the terms of order @xmath49 be off - diagonal ; b.   all lower order terms ( including those of order @xmath49 ) vanish as @xmath50 .",
    "it is instructive to perform this transformation in two steps :    a.   first , transform into a system where the leading terms are represented as products of @xmath51-independent and @xmath51-dependent factors .",
    "b.   second , diagonalize the @xmath51-independent factors .",
    "for the first step , introducing @xmath52 by @xmath53 where @xmath54 transforms into a new lax pair    [ lax - vec-1 ] @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57      for the second step , it is important that the commutator of @xmath58 and @xmath59 vanishes identically , i.e. , @xmath60\\equiv 0 $ ] , which allows simultaneous diagonalization of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "indeed , we have    [ la - a ] @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the identity @xmath12 matrix ,    [ la - p ] @xmath63 and @xmath64    here @xmath65 , @xmath66 are the solutions of the algebraic equation @xmath67 so that @xmath68 as @xmath48 , where @xmath69 .",

    "moreover , it can be checked directly that the diagonal entries of @xmath78 and @xmath79 are of order @xmath80 .",
    "this latter fact is important to establish the large-@xmath31 behavior of @xmath81 @xcite .    on the other hand , @xmath82 and @xmath83 as @xmath19 , which suggests introducing a @xmath12 diagonal function @xmath84 that solves the system    [ q - dif ] @xmath85    as follows : @xmath86 with @xmath87 the fact that the equations in are consistent follows directly from the dp equation in the form :",
