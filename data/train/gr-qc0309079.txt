    "wave propagation around nontrivial solutions of einstein equations , black holes in particular , is an active field of research ( see @xcite and references therein ) . the perspective of gravitational wave detection in the near future and the great development of numerical general relativity have increased even further the activity on this field .",
    "gravitational waves should be especially strong when emitted by black holes .",
    "the study of the propagation of perturbations around them is , hence , essential to provide templates for gravitational wave identification . on the other hand ,",
    "recent astrophysical observations indicate that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion phase , suggesting the existence of a small positive cosmological constant and that de sitter ( ds ) geometry provides a good description of very large scales of the universe @xcite .",
    "we notice also that string theory has recently motivated many works on asymptotically anti  de sitter spacetimes ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    in this work ,",
    "we perform an exhaustive investigation of scalar , electromagnetic , and gravitational perturbations in the background of schwarzchild  de sitter ( sds ) and reissner  nordstrm  de sitter ( rnds ) spacetimes . contrasting with the noncharged case , in the rnds one",
    "the electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations are necessarily coupled .",
    "we scan the full range of the cosmological constant , from the asymptotic flat case ( @xmath0 ) up to the critical value of @xmath1 which characterizes , for the noncharged case , the nariai solution @xcite .",
    "two different numerical methods and a higher order wkb analysis are used .",
    "the results are compared near the extreme @xmath1 regime , where analytical results can be obtained .",
    "we recall that for any perturbation in the spacetimes we consider that , after the initial transient phase , there are two main contributions to the resulting asymptotic wave @xcite : initially the so - called quasinormal modes , which are suppressed at later time by the tails .",
    "the first can be understood as candidates for normal modes which , however , decay ( their energy eigenvalues becomes complex ) , as in the ingenious mechanism first described by gamow in the context of nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "after the initial transient phase , the properties of the resulting waves are more related to the background spacetime rather than to the source itself .",
    "it is well known that for asymptotically flat backgrounds the tails decay according to a power law , whereas in a space with a positive cosmological constant the decay is exponential .",
    "curiously , @xmath2 modes for scalar fields in ds spacetimes , contrasting with the asymptotic flat cases , exponentially approach a nonvanishing asymptotic value @xcite .",
    "we detected , by using a noncharacteristic numerical integration scheme , a dependence of this asymptotic value on the initial velocities .",
    "in particular , it vanishes for static initial conditions .",
    "our results are in perfect agreement with the analytical predictions of @xcite .",
    "the semianalytical analyses of this work were performed by using the higher order wkb method proposed by schutz and will @xcite , and improved by iyer and will @xcite .",
    "it provides a very accurate and systematic way to study black hole quasinormal modes .",
    "we apply it to the study of various perturbation fields in the nonasymptotically flat ds geometry .",
    "quasinormal modes are also calculated according to this approximation , and the results are compared to the numerical ones whenever appropriate , providing a quite complete picture of the question of quasinormal perturbations for ds black holes .    concerning the charged case , we analyze in detail the wave propagation of the massless scalar field and coupled electromagnetic and gravitational fields in the rnds spacetime .",
    "an important difference concerning the dynamics of the electromagnetic and gravitational fields is that there are no pure modes , since both are interrelated .",
    "we will show that the direct picture of the evolution presents us with perfect agreement of quasinormal frequencies with those obtained by using the approximation method suggested in @xcite .",
    "one important point assessed is the dependence of the fields decay on the electric charge of the black hole , including the asymptotically flat limit , for which we expected to find traces of a power law tail appearing between the quasinormal modes and the exponential tail .",
    "two very recent works overlap our analysis presented here .",
    "a similar wkb approach , presented in @xcite , was used very recently by zhidenko @xcite to study sds black holes , giving results in agreement with ours .",
    "yoshida and futamase @xcite used a continued fraction numerical code to calculate quasinormal mode frequencies , with special emphasis on high order modes .",
    "our results are also compatible .",
    "finally , we notice that solutions of the wave equation in a nontrivial background have also been used to infer intrinsic properties of the spacetime @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows .",
