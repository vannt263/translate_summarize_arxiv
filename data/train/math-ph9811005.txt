    "the physical situation which has initiated this research is that of a dielectric particle with electric charges on its surface , placed in electric field . here , the diffusion equation of the charges is coupled with the maxwell equations .",
    "there is an analytical solution of this system of equation @xcite which involves some functional calculus with operators , in particular with laplace - beltrami operator defined on the surface of that particle .",
    "we can imagine many other physical situations described by a complicated system of equations where the laplace - beltrami operator is implicated ( e.g. that of the acoustic wave scattering on particles with membrane , etc . ) .",
    "as before , one can find a compact solution by using functional calculus .",
    "however , these solutions are not complete because , at this level , all is formal .",
    "we must have an effective procedure to calculate the expressions which involve operators .",
    "one can try to compute the matrices of those operators in some orthonormal basis and to transform the problem in to algebraic one .",
    "the practical problem is that one can compute only a finite number of matrix elements and this can leads to serious problem when unbounded operators are implicated . if we choose an inappropriate basis , it is possible that the expressions , calculated with truncated matrices , to not converge at the correct result",
    ".    in this paper we will find an orthonormal basis in the space of square integrable functions defined on a surfaces with axial symmetry such that the truncated matrices of laplace - beltrami operator converge in the norm resolvent sense .",
    "then , according to @xcite we can use these truncated matrices in functional calculus .",
    "let @xmath0 be a @xmath1 closed 2-dimensional surface which in the spherical coordinates @xmath2 relative to a 3-orthogonal system of axes is defined by the equation @xmath3 .",
