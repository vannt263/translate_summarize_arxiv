    "only systems observed with radar fall in this class . over 35 binary neas have been observed with radar , but only about ten have sufficient data to yield mutual orbits and component size estimates .",

    "we numerically investigate the coupled spin and orbital dynamics of two extended rigid objects under their mutual gravitational influence .",
    "we neglect the translational motion of the system barycenter and use the 6 first - order differential equations of motion ( eoms ) derived by @xcite . here",
    "we express these eoms in the body - fixed frame of the primary :    @xmath2    here @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the relative position and linear momentum vectors of the secondary with respect to the primary , respectively , @xmath5 is the reduced mass of the system , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the masses of the primary and secondary , respectively , @xmath8 is the mutual gravitational potential , @xmath9 s are the torque vectors acting on the two components , @xmath10 s are their angular velocity vectors , and @xmath11 s are their angular momentum vectors .",

    "oscillations of the secondary orientation with respect to the primary - to - secondary line are called _ librations_. in order to illustrate librations , let us first examine a situation in which the amount of angular momentum exchanged between the spin of the secondary and the mutual orbit is negligible .",
    "in this situation , we can treat the spin and orbit to be decoupled . a common approach to analyze the spin of the secondary",
    "is to assume the secondary to be a triaxial ellipsoid on a fixed kelperian mutual orbit about a spherical primary .",
    "the secondary spin is affected by the gravitational torques exerted by the primary(e.g .",
    "in this situation , the angle @xmath56 is the sum of _ free , forced , and optical _ libration angles . _",
    "free libration _ is easiest to understand in the case of a circular mutual orbit and a synchronously spinning secondary , i.e. , a secondary whose average spin rate is equal to the mutual orbit mean motion .",
    "the minimum energy configuration for this system is for the long axis of the secondary to always point towards the primary , such that its instantaneous spin rate is always equal to the mean motion .",
    "if the secondary is disturbed from this configuration , its long axis oscillates about the primary - secondary line due to torques exerted by the primary on the elongated secondary .",
    "this oscillation is called free libration and its frequency depends on the shape of the secondary and the mutual orbit parameters .",
    "generally , free libration damps out on short timescales due to tidal friction @xcite .",
    "if the mutual orbit is eccentric , the secondary exhibits optical and forced librations about the primary - secondary line even if the free libration is damped out . _ optical libration _ is the torque - free oscillation of the long axis of a uniformly spinning secondary about the primary - secondary line .",

    "nevertheless , even in the fully coupled problem around an axially symmetric primary , the secondary exhibits libration behavior similar to the free , forced , and optical librations of the decoupled spin problem .",
    "there are two modes of libration in the coupled spin - orbit problem , which we call the _ relaxed mode _ and _ excited mode _ of libration .",
    "the relaxed mode has the same frequency as the orbital frequency , similar to forced+optical libration in the decoupled spin problem .",
    "the excited mode of libration has a different frequency that depends on the shape of the secondary .",
    "this libration mode is similar to free libration in the decoupled spin problem . by exploring a range of initial conditions",
    ", we can minimize the excited - mode librations so that its amplitude is close @xmath71 , leaving the secondary librating in the relaxed mode .",
    "the relaxed mode disappears only when the system is in an equilibrium state , i.e. , when the mutual orbit is circular and the long axis of the secondary always points towards the primary .    for systems in which the exchange of angular momentum in the system is small",
    ", the coupled spin - orbit problem approaches the decoupled problem and the relaxed - mode and excited - mode librations become similar to the forced+optical and free librations , respectively . because most of our simulations include some amount of spin - orbit coupling , we use the relaxed / excited mode terminology as opposed to the free / forced mode terminology of the decoupled problem .",
    "in this section , we study the effects of spin - orbit coupling on the relaxed - mode libration amplitude of the secondary . under the assumptions of a fixed orbit around a spherical or point - mass primary , the amplitudes of forced+optical librations ( @xmath70 ) in the decoupled case can be estimated with  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", we use keplerian elements to describe the osculating mutual orbit at each time step .",
    "these elements vary on timescales shorter than the orbital period because the orbit is not keplerian .",

    "the system parameters for this plot are based on radar - derived estimates for near - earth asteroid ( nea ) 1991  vh  @xcite and are given in row 3 of table  [ tab : parameters ] .",

    "the secondary spins three times for every two orbits , so it is in a 3:2 spin - orbit resonance .",
    "mercury is the only known object in a 3:2 spin - orbit resonance .",
    "for the red trajectory surrounding @xmath84 , the secondary is in a 1:1 spin - orbit resonance , i.e. , it spins synchronously ( e.g. , the earth s moon ) .",
    "similar trajectories with islands centered exclusively on @xmath81 and @xmath82 exist near half - integer values of @xmath85 ( 2 , 2.5 , 3 , etc . ) .",
    "the horizontal extent of the trajectory around @xmath81 gives the amplitude of excited - mode libration ( equivalent to free libration in the decoupled spin problem ) .",
    "for example , on the red trajectory in the 1:1 resonance region , the secondary has an excited mode libration amplitude of @xmath86 . a trajectory with only relaxed - mode libration plots as a point on the y - axis , which we call the _ center _ of the resonance region ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "the relaxed - mode libration is not detectable in the horizontal dimension of the surface of section plots because we sample the spin state of the secondary at pericenter , where the relaxed - mode libration is always at @xmath71 phase .",
    "however , the relaxed - mode libration is detectable in the vertical dimension of the surface of section plots because it contributes to the angular velocity of the secondary at pericenter .",
    "the centers of the resonance regions are displaced vertically from their nominal positions in the absence of relaxed - mode libration .",
    "these offsets can be seen clearly for relaxed - mode librations with larger amplitudes ( figures [ fig : vh_ss ] and [ fig : yt1_ss ] ) .",
    "they are strictly due to torques on the permanent deformation of the satellite and are unrelated to the tidally induced pseudo - synchronous rotation described by , e.g. , @xcite for nearly spherical satellites on eccentric orbits .",
    "a chaotic ( blue color ) trajectory marks the boundary of a resonance region and is called a separatrix . on a separatrix",
    "the secondary explores the entire range of @xmath54 values and the trajectory fills up a region of phase space , indicating that the trajectory is chaotic .",
    "secondary spin rates that are further away from the resonance regions put the secondary on a trajectory similar to one of the non - resonant quasi - periodic ( green ) trajectories . on these trajectories",
    "the secondary is not in a spin - orbit resonance and circulates through all @xmath54 values in a quasi - periodic manner .",
    "these trajectories are called quasi - periodic because they exhibit at least one non - commensurate frequency in addition to the frequency at which the motion is sampled .",
    "@xcite assumed that the secondary spin is decoupled from the mutual orbit , a reasonable assumption for the saturn - hyperion system because hyperion has negligible angular momentum compared to the mutual orbit . under this approximation",
    ", they derive the half - widths of the resonance regions ( equation  ( [ eq : res_width ] ) , in units of the mean motion ) and of the chaotic separatrix surrounding the 1:1 spin - orbit resonance ( equation  ( [ eq : chaos ] ) , in the energy domain ) :    @xmath87    @xmath88    here , @xmath89 are functions tabulated in  @xcite and @xmath26 is the spin - orbit resonance ratio , e.g. , @xmath90 for a 3:2 spin - orbit resonance .",
    "@xmath91 represents energy variations on the chaotic separatrix and @xmath92 comes from the first integral of the averaged equation of motion of libration @xcite .",

    "the higher frequency terms that give rise to chaos are ignored , so the separatrix is regular .",
    "the width of the resonance and of the chaotic regions grow larger with @xmath95 and @xmath63 .",
    "for large enough values , neighboring resonance regions overlap , resulting in a large chaotic zone surrounding the overlapping resonances . the resonance overlap criterion for the 1:1 and 3:2 spin - orbit resonances",
    "is given by @xcite : @xmath96 overlap occurs when @xmath97 .",
    "these equations were derived under the assumption that the secondary spin has no feedback on the mutual orbit , and we investigate whether the analytical formulation ( equation ( [ eq : ro ] ) ) matches the results of our coupled integrator . for a system based on 1991  vh ( table  [ tab : parameters ] ) , we varied the elongation in steps of 0.01 and determined when resonance overlap occurred .",
    "we find that it does not occur for @xmath98 1.03 ( @xmath99 0.30 ) but that it does occur for @xmath100 1.04 ( @xmath101 0.34 ) . the analytical estimate , which does not take the width of the separatrix into account , places the onset of chaos at @xmath102 for @xmath79 .",
    "the small difference between the analytical and numerical estimates for the onset of chaos suggests that equation ( [ eq : ro ] ) provides a reasonable approximation even in the presence of spin - orbit coupling . in subsequent sections",
    ", we will confirm this finding by providing values for both estimates for a variety of orbital eccentricities .",

    "this suggests that resonance overlaps are quite likely to happen in binary near - earth asteroids .",

    "since the spin is coupled to the orbit , energy removed from the secondary spin will gradually change the orbit , the surface of section map , and the relaxed - mode libration amplitude and frequency . throughout this evolution ,",
    "the secondary remains in the same dynamical regime close to the center of the synchronous region .",
    "the next higher order stable resonance is the 2:1 resonance , however probability of capture into this resonance is low ( @xmath120 using equation 5.110 of @xcite ) .",
    "similar to the synchronous region , the 2:1 resonance region is shifted vertically from @xmath121 .",
    "the shift in this case is upwards because the instantaneous satellite spin rate at pericenter is greater than its orbit - averaged value of @xmath122 .",
    "preliminary measurements of the doppler extents ( or bandwidths ) of the secondary in radar images  @xcite are consistent with chaotic behavior , but because of the large amplitude libration at the resonance center and corresponding spin rate variations ( section  [ sec : implications2 ] ) , we can not entirely rule out the possibility of synchronous spin .",
    "this system s component sizes are @xmath123  m and @xmath124  m , so the primary is similar to that of 1991 vh but the secondary is a few times smaller .",
    "the orbit ( @xmath125 ) is somewhat wider than that of 1991  vh ( @xmath126 ) , and it is also more eccentric ( @xmath127 vs. @xmath79 )",
    ". the smaller secondary and wider mutual orbit mean that spin and orbit are less coupled in this system than in 1991  vh .",
    "substituting @xmath127 in equation  ( [ eq : ro ] ) , we get a theoretical threshold for resonance overlap @xmath128 , which corresponds to @xmath129 . using our simulations",
    "we find that the resonance overlap threshold lies between @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) and @xmath132 ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "the elongation of the satellite is unknown . for our simulations ( figure  [ fig : yt1_ss ] ) , we chose an elongation of 1.3 .",
    "the 1:1 spin - orbit resonance region is not as prominent in this plot as it is in figure  [ fig : vh_ss ] due to the higher eccentricity . despite the higher eccentricity ,",
    "the y - axis location of the synchronous region center is similar to that of 1991  vh , because of the smaller satellite elongation .",
    "the chaotic region is much bigger than that of 1991  vh and extends to @xmath133 .",
    "the first higher order stable resonance is the 5:2 spin - orbit resonance .",
    "this resonance region is shifted upwards from @xmath134 , similar to the upward shift of the 2:1 resonance region of 1991  vh .",
    "the amplitude of the relaxed - mode libration measured at the center of the synchronous region is about 45@xmath66 .",
    "2004  dc has the smallest primary ( @xmath135 m ) , secondary ( @xmath136 m ) , and mutual orbit semimajor axis ( 750 m ) in our sample , but it has the most eccentric mutual orbit ( @xmath137 ) ( table  [ tab : parameters ] ) .",
    "the resonance overlap criterion ( equation  [ eq : ro ] ) gives @xmath138 , which corresponds to an elongation of @xmath131 .",
    "using our simulations we find that the resonance overlap threshold lies between @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) and @xmath141 ( @xmath130 ) , roughly consistent with the analytical estimate .",
    "the shape of the secondary is not known , however its appearance in the radar images suggest that @xmath142 ( patrick taylor , personal communication ) . figure  [ fig : dc_ss ] shows the surface of section plot for a secondary having an elongation of 1.3 ( system parameters in table  [ tab : parameters ] ) .",
    "the chaotic region is so large that even the 1:1 resonance region disappears and the lowest - order stable resonance region is the 4:1 spin - orbit resonance .",
    "in fact the synchronous island is absent for all values of satellite elongations @xmath143 .",
    "radar data show that the satellites of 2000  dp107 , 2002  ce26 , 2001  sn263 ( gamma ) , 1999  kw4 , and 1994  cc ( beta ) are synchronous ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "didymos may also be synchronous  @xcite ; for our purposes we assume that it is .",
    "@xcite found that 1996  fg3 is synchronous .",
    "we use radar - derived mutual orbital parameters , component radii , and component masses for simulating these systems .",
    "these parameters are given in table  [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "for satellites whose elongations are not well known , we perform simulations using @xmath108=1.01 , 1.05 , 1.1 , 1.2 , and 1.3 .",
    "each simulation is performed with initial conditions that put the trajectory at the center of the synchronous island .",
    "we identify the center of the synchronous island by varying the values of initial @xmath53 until the horizontal extent of the trajectory on the surface of section becomes @xmath10 . as mentioned in section  [ sec : vh ] , the excited - mode libration amplitude is zero at the center of the synchronous island , which is what is expected for a tidally evolved satellite . in this case",
    ", the satellite exhibits only the relaxed - mode libration , which we measure as the angle between the long axis of the secondary and the line joining the primary and secondary centers of masses ( in the decoupled terminology , this is the optical+forced libration ) .",
    "the libration amplitudes , i.e. , the maximum values of the libration angles , are plotted as a function of elongation in figure  [ fig : all_lib ] .",
    "the analytical estimates of the libration amplitudes , assuming the decoupled spin - orbit problem , are given by equation  ( [ eq : lib ] ) .    since shape and spin state modeling are tied to each other  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , calculations such as those shown in figure  [ fig : all_lib ] are useful for shape modeling of asteroid satellites .",
    "these estimates are also useful for modeling binary yorp torques  @xcite on synchronous satellites .",
    "if a system exhibits excited - mode libration in addition to the relaxed - mode libration , the two librations will add up and create a beating pattern . because the amplitudes and frequencies of excited - mode libration can span a wide range of values , 3d reconstruction and binary yorp modeling of dynamically excited satellites is complicated .",
    "in section  [ sec : systems ] , we showed that resonance overlap is likely to occur for asynchronous satellites in our sample and that large chaotic zones are expected in their phase spaces .",
    "this behavior can be expected in other , similar systems .",
    "let us consider the evolution of a satellite formed with a high initial spin rate such that its trajectory in phase space is in or above the chaotic zone , the situation expected for most satellites in the formation model of @xcite .",
    "it is possible for yorp to increase the spin rate of the satellite , but we focus on the spin - down evolution under the influence of tidal and yorp forces .",
    "satellites that start above the chaotic region will most likely encounter the chaotic zone on their way to the 1:1 spin - orbit resonance region . in the chaotic zone",
    ", the satellite is acted upon by tides , yorp , and torques on its permanent shape , which cause the chaotic spin .",
    "since the spin of the satellite is coupled to the mutual orbit , angular momentum removed or added to the secondary spin by tides and yorp will also affect the mutual orbit and cause the surface of section map of the secondary to vary .",
    "however , for binary neas , the angular momentum of the mutual orbit is much greater than that of the secondary spin , so the effect is expected to be small .",
    "we neglect this effect for the following discussion and assume the surface of section map to be roughly constant during the evolution of the secondary spin in the chaotic zone .",
    "if the chaotic separatrix around the 1:1 spin - orbit resonance region is extremely thin , as is the case for satellites having almost spherical shapes , then the torques on the permanent shape will be small , allowing tides or yorp to easily drive the satellite spin across the separatrix and into the synchronous region . for satellites having larger chaotic zones ,",
    "like the asynchronous satellites in section  [ sec : systems ] , tides or yorp can not simply sweep the satellite across the chaotic region because torques on the permanent shape can increase as well as decrease the spin rate of the satellite in a random manner .",
    "the synchronous capture process is essentially stochastic in nature . for capture to occur , the satellite has to spend enough time near the boundary of the synchronous region for tides or yorp to torque the satellite into resonance .",
    "such a process was discussed by @xcite .",
    "the details of this capture process are not known and are difficult to model , however the probability of this happening will depend on the relative magnitude of @xmath109 compared to the energy dissipated due to tides ( @xmath144 ) or yorp ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "simulations and equation  [ eq : chaos ] show that values of chaotic spin energy variations ( @xmath109 ) for the asynchronous satellites are within an order of magnitude of 1 .",
    "we estimate the magnitude of tidal dissipation in one orbit using the following equation from @xcite : @xmath146 here @xmath147 is the love number , @xmath148 is the tidal dissipation factor , @xmath74 is the mean motion , @xmath149 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath114 is the radius of the secondary .",
    "we approximate energy dissipation due to yorp in one orbit by multiplying the yorp torque given in @xcite by the satellite rotation over one orbit , @xmath150 assuming 2 satellite rotations per orbit : @xmath151 here @xmath152 is the solar luminosity , @xmath153 is the yorp torque efficiency , @xmath33 is the speed of light , @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the semimajor axis and eccentricity of the heliocentric orbit , respectively . in order to compare the tidal and yorp energy dissipation with @xmath109 , we normalize @xmath156 and @xmath157 using @xmath92 from equation  [ eq : separatrix ] .    for computing @xmath156 we assume @xmath158 and estimate @xmath147 values using three different models . in the rubble pile model of @xcite , @xmath159 , where @xmath114 is in km .",
    "using the system parameters from table  [ tab : parameters ] , we determine @xmath144 for all the asynchronous satellites to be between @xmath160 and @xmath45 . assuming the monolith model of @xcite for the secondary yields lower values of @xmath161 because a monolith is more rigid than a rubble pile of the same size and has a lower value of @xmath147 . @xcite",
    "derived a different relation between love number and radius , @xmath162 , by assuming that orbits of observed synchronous asteroid satellites are in an equilibrium state such that tidal torques balance binary yorp torques .",
    "subsituting @xmath147 values from this relation in equation  ( [ eq : tides ] ) yields @xmath144 between @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "we compute @xmath165 by assuming @xmath166 , the estimated value for asteroid yorp @xcite .",
    "@xmath145 values for 1991  vh , 2003  yt1 , and 2004  dc are @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 , respectively .",
    "unknown values of @xmath148 , @xmath147 , and @xmath170 introduce uncertainties of a few orders of magnitude in @xmath156 and @xmath157 but these energy dissipation values are several orders of magnitudes smaller than @xmath109 , suggesting that chaotic variations in energy dominate tidal and yorp dissipations in these systems .",
    "this may substantially delay spin synchronization and , therefore , byorp - type evolution .",
    "if the timescale for synchronous capture is long , then tides may damp the mutual orbit eccentricity significantly before spin synchronization .",
    "this will reduce the size of the chaotic zone as dictated by equation  [ eq : chaos ] and make it easier for tides or yorp to torque the secondary into the synchronous region .",
    "tidal damping of eccentricity is not a very effective process and timescales may be quite long .",
    "@xcite estimated timescales in the range @xmath171 to @xmath172 years for the asynchronous satellites , but these may be in error because the underlying formalism by @xcite assumes synchronous rotators .",
    "it is likely that energy dissipates faster in the case of satellites that are torqued and tidally deformed in a chaotic manner , but the nature and characteristic timescale of the eccentricity evolution remain poorly known . complicating the picture",
    "is the fact that other mechanisms such as solar perturbations  @xcite or planetary flybys  @xcite may also be effective at damping or exciting eccentricities .",
    "although there is uncertainty related to the eccentricity - damping timescale , byorp - type evolution can not take place until the spin period is synchronized to the orbital period .",
    "asteroid binaries may enjoy extended lives because their chaotically spinning secondaries prevent byorp evolution .",
    "our results have implications for radar and lightcurve data interpretation . in radar observations ( images and spectra ) , the doppler extent ( or bandwidth ) of an object is proportional to its apparent , instantaneous spin rate ( inversely proportional to its spin period ) .",
    "lightcurves show variations in the object s brightness as it spins .",
    "if the object is spinning at a constant rate , the brightness variations will be approximately periodic .",
    "the primary periodicity in the lightcurve ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is often used as a proxy for the object s spin rate , even though the signal is affected by changes in relative positions between the sun , the object , and the observer .",
    "we showed in section  [ sec : systems ] that asteroid satellite spin rates can be time - variable .",
    "when the lightcurve data are of sufficient quality and when @xmath173 , it is sometimes possible to distinguish the signal of the secondary from that of the primary . in radar data , where the secondary is typically easily detectable",
    ", the spinning satellite will exhibit approximately periodic bandwidth variations .",
    "however , in both cases , a variable spin rate severely complicates the analysis . understanding the time - varying nature of the satellite spin is important when analyzing radar and lightcurve data .",
    "figure  [ fig : vh ] shows spin rate as a function of time for four trajectories of 1991  vh .",
    "the top panel shows a trajectory at the center of the synchronous island .",
    "even though it would plot as a point on a surface of section , the satellite spin rate exhibits a large oscillation at the orbital rate with an amplitude slightly greater than the mean motion , @xmath74 . as mentioned in section  [ sec : sos ] , this oscillation is the relaxed - mode libration of the satellite .",
    "the second panel in figure  [ fig : vh ] shows a chaotic trajectory . the spin rate variations span a similar , but slightly larger , range of values than that in the synchronous case .",
    "if observations ( radar or photometric ) were sparse , it would be difficult or even impossible to ascertain whether a trajectory was periodic or chaotic . with a sufficient number of data points sampled at a sufficiently fast cadence , one could examine the distribution of spin rate values to identify the type of trajectory , as the distributions for resonant and chaotic trajectories are different .",
    "spin rate variations on the synchronous trajectory resemble a sinusoid , so the distribution of spin rates looks approximately bimodal .",
    "the spin rate distribution of the satellite in the chaotic region can not be generalized and depends on specific system parameters .",
    "the third and fourth panels show the 3:2 resonant trajectory ( red ) and the quasi - periodic ( green ) trajectory of figure  [ fig : vh_ss ] , respectively .",
    "in these cases , the variations are much smaller than the previous two trajectories .",
    "these rotational regimes are easier to identify because large - scale chaotic variations are not present .    in radar data analysis ,",
    "modeling the spin state and shape of objects are tied to each other ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "incorrect spin state assumptions may yield incorrect shape models .",
    "our results indicate that in some cases it will be impossible to identify the spin state of the satellite , whereas in other cases an appropriate rotational model will provide a good fit to the data .",
    "a simple model of uniform rotation may not be sufficient , as libration amplitudes can cause displacements that exceed the image resolution .",
    "we recommend using a model that includes librations for the 3d reconstruction of asteroid satellites with even moderate eccentricity and elongation .",
    "we examined the rotational regimes of asteroid satellites using surfaces of section .",
    "the trajectories can be broadly classified as resonant , non - resonant quasi - periodic , and chaotic . in order to identify the specific type of spin behavior ,",
    "a dense time sampling of the satellite spin state is necessary ( section  [ sec : implications2 ] ) , however such datasets are seldom available .",
    "even densely sampled lightcurves , for instance , do not yield measurements of the instantaneous spin state due to the necessity of observing @xmath11 full period to estimate the spin period . in section  [ sec : implications2 ]",
    ", we showed that even synchronous satellites can undergo large variations in spin rates , potentially masquerading as asynchronous satellites .",
    "careful analysis of the data along with coupled spin - orbit simulations can be used to correctly identify the spin behavior .",
    "identifying the spin configurations is essential for obtaining accurate physical models of the satellites .",
    "the spin configurations of satellites play a crucial role in the secular evolution of binary / triple systems under the influence of forces such as tides and binary yorp .",
    "for example , the binary yorp torque acts only on satellites whose spin periods are integer multiples of their orbital periods  @xcite and some estimates suggest that this torque could disrupt binary systems in just a few tens of thousands of years  @xcite . thus understanding the process of spin synchronization is essential for understanding the evolution of binaries . in section  [ sec : implications1 ] , we showed that satellites may have significantly longer spin synchronization timescales than those estimated by considering tidal and/or yorp forces only .",
    "this would increase the fraction of asynchronous binaries in the observed population beyond what one would expect on the basis of tidal despinning timescales .",
    "the corresponding delay in the onset of binary yorp implies that the lifetimes of binary asteroids can be significantly longer than the few tens of thousands of years suggested by binary yorp models .",
    "we examined the results of spin - orbit coupling in the planar case .",
    "however , @xcite , using 3d simulations , showed that seemingly stable configurations in planar simulations can be attitude unstable .",
    "future work will involve studying inclined / oblique binary systems in order to test the attitude stability of satellites in various regions of phase space .",
    "our integrator can also be used for studying the secular evolution of binary asteroids .",
    "this will require implemention of radiation pressure and tidal forces .",

    "<S> we develop a fourth - order numerical integrator to simulate the coupled spin and orbital motions of two rigid bodies having arbitrary mass distributions under the influence of their mutual gravitational potential . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate the dynamics of components in well - characterized binary and triple near - earth asteroid systems and use surface of section plots to map the possible spin configurations of the satellites . for asynchronous satellites , </S>",
    "<S> the analysis reveals large regions of phase space where the spin state of the satellite is chaotic . for synchronous satellites , </S>",
    "<S> we show that libration amplitudes can reach detectable values even for moderately elongated shapes . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of chaotic regions in the phase space has important consequences for the evolution of binary asteroids . </S>",
    "<S> it may substantially increase spin synchronization timescales , explain the observed fraction of asynchronous binaries , delay byorp - type evolution , and extend the lifetime of binaries . </S>",
    "<S> the variations in spin rate due to large librations also affect the analysis and interpretation of lightcurve and radar observations .    </S>",
