    "the phenomenon of entanglement is one of the most fundamental and counterintuitive features of quantum mechanics .",
    "its fundamental role was emphasized by the formulation of the epr paradox @xcite , despite the original purpose of the latter to question physical reality of the wave function . the counterintuitive nature of entanglement is a hallmark of quantum mechanics , and its properties reveal deep distinctions between quantum and classical objects .    from the mathematical point of view entanglement",
    "is a consequence of the superposition principle and the tensor product postulate in quantum mechanics .",
    "specifically , the principle and postulate imply that a state vector of a system consisting of several subsystems is a linear combination of tensor products of state vectors of the subsystems .",
    "mathematical and physical properties of states interrelate : a state is disentangled if it can be transformed into a factorizable state ; any other state is entangled .",
    "equivalently , a state is disentangled if and only if each subsystem is in a definite state .    despite the simplicity of the above qualitative features of entanglement",
    "the complete list of its quantitative characteristics is unknown .",
    "for example , it might appear that the smallest number of linearly independent factorizable terms representing a state is an appropriate characteristic of its entanglement .",
    "this is true for two subsystems , in which case this single quantity completely classifies all entangled states . for more than two subsystems , however",
    ", this quantity does not characterize entanglement since it depends on a choice of bases . to choose appropriate entanglement characteristics for the general case we need to study invariant properties of states of composite systems",
    "; these are the key properties shaping the following discussion",
    ".    for states of composite systems entanglement quantifies ways in which states of subsystems contribute to linear combinations of tensor products .",
    "the larger the numbers of contributing states of subsystems , the greater the variety of arrangements of terms in linear combinations .",
    "however , some of the arrangements should be considered as dependent since they are related by transformations of bases .",
    "such related states form equivalence classes , finding the complete set of which is the goal of entanglement classification .    to classify entangled states",
    "one usually employs entanglement invariants , which are certain invariant quantities associated with the states .",
    "the nature of the problem requires that the invariants do not change under all transformations that can be reduced to changes of bases .",
    "consequently , the invariants take the same values for all states within each equivalence class , and the standard method of finding them uses the classical theory of invariants @xcite",
    ". variants of this method are used in most known cases of partial or complete entanglement classification ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "developing the ideas outlined above , we have introduced in @xcite a new entanglement classification method based on algebraic properties of tensor products of linear maps . in this paper",
    "we generalize and expand both the method and its applications .",
    "we first introduce various equivalence relations and corresponding equivalence classes on linear spaces of states .",
    "we then show how these classes lead to various linear subspaces and their invariants , which are the central objects in our method of algebraic classification of entangled states . during the development of our method we turn repeatedly to the example of three qubits to illustrate the procedure .",
    "finally , we proceed with numerous more complicated but physical relevant examples demonstrating the use of the method in classifying the entanglement of many systems unsolved until now .",
    "we begin by introducing the main components of our construction .",
    "let @xmath0 be a quantum system that consists of @xmath1 subsystems @xmath2 , where @xmath3 . for each @xmath4",
    ", let a finite - dimensional vector space @xmath5 over a field @xmath6 be the state space of @xmath7 .",
    "extension to infinite - dimensional spaces is nontrivial and is not considered here .",
    "we choose @xmath8 for the simplicity of presentation ; the case @xmath9 needs only minimal modifications .",
    "our first task is to define the space @xmath10 , the state space of @xmath0 .",
    "the tensor product postulate in quantum mechanics says that @xmath10 is a subspace of the tensor product space @xmath11 .",
    "a specific choice of subspace @xmath10 depends on the nature of @xmath0 . for identical subsystems , for example , the permutation symmetry acting on the subsystems determines @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , for bosonic or fermionic subsystems @xmath10 is , respectively , the symmetric or antisymmetric part of the product @xmath11 . also , if there is an equivalence relation among elements of @xmath10 ( as , for example , for linearly dependent vectors in quantum mechanics ) , then @xmath10 is the appropriate quotient set .",
    "modifications due to these and similar properties can be easily included into the following development , which assumes the simplest case where @xmath12 .",
    "we aim to study properties of the system @xmath0 related to its composition in terms of the subsystems @xmath2 ; these are equivalent to properties of @xmath10 related to its composition in terms of @xmath13 .",
    "the latter manifest themselves in their transformations under an appropriate group .",
    "note that the tensor structure of @xmath10 implies that the transformation group relevant for studying properties of @xmath10 is not the general linear group of @xmath10 , @xmath14 , but rather its subgroup @xmath15 .",
    "accordingly , for each @xmath4 we choose a subgroup @xmath16 of @xmath17 and define the corresponding subgroup @xmath18 of @xmath14 . as a result , the group @xmath19 is the transformation group for @xmath10 , and it determines properties of @xmath10 related to its composition in terms of @xmath13 .",
    "particular cases ( where only certain subsets of @xmath10 and subgroups of @xmath19 matter ) are of interest as well and can be treated similarly to the general case of @xmath12 and @xmath20 considered here .      the group @xmath19 induces the equivalence relation @xmath21 on @xmath10 , which is given by @xmath22 for each @xmath23 if and only if there exists @xmath24 such that @xmath25 . the equivalence relation defines the equivalence class of @xmath26 under @xmath21 , @xmath27 since all elements of the class @xmath28 are equivalent , any one of its elements determines the whole class .",
    "it is thus convenient to replace @xmath28 with its arbitrary single element @xmath29 , which we call a representative element of the class .",
    "( for each specific class @xmath28 the choice of @xmath30 based on various symmetry considerations generally leads to simplifications . ) repeating this procedure for each @xmath31 , we partition @xmath10 into the set of equivalence classes @xmath32 such that each vector in @xmath10 belongs to one and only one class . finally ,",
    "replacing each class in @xmath33 by its representative element , we arrive at the set @xmath34 which can also be written as the quotient set @xmath35 .      understanding the structure of the quotient set @xmath36 is our ultimate goal .",
    "we begin with a general property of @xmath36 , its partition into three characteristic subsets of vectors : ( 1 ) the zero vector , ( 2 ) decomposable vectors , ( 3 ) nondecomposable vectors . by definition ,",
    "a decomposable vector @xmath31 is a vector that can be written in the factorizable form @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a nonzero vector for each @xmath4 .",
    "a nondecomposable vector is a vector which is neither zero nor decomposable .",
    "we will derive the general form of a nondecomposable vector after we establish its invariant characteristics .",
    "the above partition is physically significant because it is in a one - to - one correspondence with the partition of quantum states into three types : ( 1 ) the vacuum state , ( 2 ) disentangled states , ( 3 ) entangled states .",
    "the zero vector ( the vacuum state ) and decomposable vectors ( disentangled states ) are the simplest elements of @xmath10 ; although they comprise only a small part of @xmath10 , they span all of it .",
    "by contrast , nondecomposable vectors ( entangled states ) are more complex and difficult to categorize .",
    "the difficulty is combinatorial because decomposable vectors from @xmath10 that enter the linear combination representing a nondecomposable vector differ by ways in which linearly independent vectors from @xmath13 enter the expression .",
    "finding all such possibilities of nonequivalent combinations ( which is the same as finding the quotient set @xmath36 ) is the problem of entanglement classification .",
    "another general property of @xmath36 concerns the number of its elements .",
    "although the set @xmath36 is not a vector space , we use the notation @xmath39 for the number of unconstrained elements of @xmath6 that a general element of @xmath36 depends on . using a similar notation for @xmath40 , we find @xmath41 the inequality sign appears here because , in general , the system of linear equations for @xmath24 that follows from the equivalence condition @xmath25 is not linearly independent .",
    "we have two distinct cases here : ( 1 ) if @xmath42 , the above inequality does not tell us if there are any unconstrained elements of @xmath6 that a general element of @xmath36 depends on ; ( 2 ) if @xmath43 , there are at least @xmath44 such elements of @xmath6 . consequently , @xmath36 is an infinite set in the second case .",
    "asymptotically for large @xmath1 , @xmath45 is exponential in @xmath1 and @xmath40 is at most quadratic in @xmath1 .",
    "it follows that @xmath1 does not need to be very large for the set @xmath36 to be infinite ; in other words , @xmath36 is typically infinite .      to illustrate the concepts introduced above",
    ", we consider a particular example of three qubits , in which case there are three @xmath46-dimensional spaces @xmath47 and their tensor product @xmath48 .",
    "we choose arbitrary bases @xmath49 for each @xmath5 and expand an arbitrary element @xmath31 in terms of its coordinates @xmath50 , @xmath51 the transformation group @xmath19 acts on @xmath26 according to @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and the coordinates of @xmath54 are @xmath55    the simplest example of a decomposable vector in @xmath10 ( a disentangled state in @xmath0 ) is @xmath56 .",
    "this is a state of the system @xmath0 in which each of its subsystems @xmath7 is in a definite state @xmath57 .",
    "there are three types of nondecomposable vectors in @xmath10 ( entangled states in @xmath0 ) .",
    "for the first type , vectors are nondecomposable for the tensor product of two spaces but decomposable for the tensor product of the three spaces . choosing @xmath58 and @xmath59 as two such spaces",
    ", we have the state @xmath60 in which the subsystems @xmath61 and @xmath62 are not in definite states , while the subsystem @xmath63 is in a definite state .",
    "the other two states of this type are obtained by permutation of the subsystems . for the second and third type ( which in the literature are called respectively the w and the ghz classes ) ,",
    "states are nondecomposable for the tensor product of the three spaces .",
    "the standard forms of their representative states are @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "for these states , no subsystem is in a definite state .    applying all elements of the group @xmath19 to a representative vector @xmath26 in any of the above three types of elements of @xmath10 , we obtain the equivalence class @xmath28 , which leads to @xmath66 equivalence classes ( counting permutations and including the zero vector which is in its own equivalence class ) .",
    "this is a well - known result ( which we also proved by using our method in @xcite ) that these @xmath66 classes constitute the complete entanglement classification of three qubits .",
    "the problem of finding @xmath36 can be solved by direct or indirect methods . in a direct method",
    ", one uses the definition of @xmath36 to derive the general form of representative elements of equivalence classes . although there are no restrictions to such methods in theory , they are usually inefficient in practice because of the need to solve complicated equations . by contrast , in an indirect method , one seeks quantities characterizing elements of @xmath10 which are invariant under @xmath19 .",
    "equivalence classes are obtained by finding allowed values of these invariants .",
    "indirect methods are usually efficient if all invariants are known .    continuing with indirect methods , let @xmath67 be an invariant of @xmath26 induced by the group @xmath19 .",
    "this is a quantity that satisfies @xmath68 for each @xmath31 , @xmath69 , which implies that invariants depend only on classes .",
    "let @xmath70 be a complete set of algebraically independent invariants of @xmath26 , so that @xmath22 if and only if @xmath71 , for each @xmath23 . the standard method of finding @xmath70 is to use the classical theory of invariants and covariants ; for a modern introduction , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "almost all known cases of partial or complete entanglement classifications use this method to a certain extent ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the rapid increase of @xmath72 with @xmath1 is the main reason why only the simplest cases of entanglement classification have been fully carried out .",
    "let us now consider a typical case of infinite @xmath36 .",
    "we find that the set of all possible values of the invariants , @xmath73 , is infinite .",
    "the resulting information about @xmath36 in terms of its elements and invariants is both overwhelming in its detail and impractical in its use . as a key part of our method",
    ", we reduce the amount of information by grouping equivalence classes into a finite number of sets .",
    "the grouping is determined by certain equivalence relation between classes in each set , a natural choice for which is defined as follows .",
    "we first introduce the rescaling equivalence of invariants .",
    "we note that since linearly dependent vectors in quantum mechanics correspond to the same physical state , we require @xmath74 for each @xmath31 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "it follows that algebraic invariants are homogeneous polynomials ; consequently , zero is the most important value of each invariant .",
    "this suggests we extend the above rescaling equivalence of states to the rescaling equivalence of invariants .",
    "specifically , we define the equivalence relation @xmath77 on the field @xmath6 by setting @xmath78 for each @xmath79 if and only if there exists @xmath75 , @xmath76 such that @xmath80 .",
    "( for @xmath8 or @xmath9 , this simply means that any two nonzero elements are equivalent . )",
    "it is easy to generalize this equivalence to ordered sets over @xmath6 , so that for each pair of such sets @xmath81 and @xmath82 we define @xmath83 if and only if @xmath84 for each @xmath85 .    having established equivalence for invariants , we transfer it to vectors .",
    "namely , we define the equivalence relation @xmath86 on the set @xmath10 by setting @xmath87 if and only if @xmath88 , for each @xmath23 .",
    "since invariants depend only on classes , @xmath22 implies @xmath87 .",
    "the relation @xmath89 defines the quantities @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 in the same manner as the relation @xmath21 defines the quantities @xmath28 , @xmath30 , @xmath33 , @xmath36 .",
    "clearly , @xmath92 is a partition of @xmath33 .    the sets @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the main objects of our study .",
    "we call the problem of finding them the restricted entanglement classification problem to emphasize that we seek only sets of classes , not the classes themselves . one way to solve the problem is to use the set of invariants @xmath70 from the standard classification method .",
    "this approach requires studying conditions under which elements of @xmath70 are zero .",
    "if @xmath70 is known , this method gives the solution ; however , we prefer a simpler approach that uses new algebraic invariants @xmath94 instead of @xmath70 .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that each element of @xmath94 describes certain algebraic properties of @xmath26 and takes a value from only a finite set of integers .",
    "the construction of @xmath94 uses only basic linear algebra  @xcite and proceeds as follows .",
    "the set of invariants @xmath94 is uniquely determined by the following conditions .",
    "first , @xmath94 depends only on the equivalence class @xmath90 to which @xmath26 belongs . as a result ,",
    "both @xmath90 and @xmath94 are invariant under the action of the transformation group @xmath19 .",
    "second , the rescaling property of @xmath70 implies that @xmath94 depends only on properties of linear subspaces of @xmath10 ; let @xmath95 be the set of such subspaces .",
    "third , @xmath95 depends linearly on @xmath26 .",
    "fourth , @xmath95 describes properties of @xmath26 associated with all partitions of the system @xmath0 into subsystems build from @xmath2 .",
    "such partitions result from all choices of writing @xmath10 as the tensor product of spaces built from @xmath13 .",
    "the above conditions require that @xmath95 is defined in terms of linear maps .",
    "we find these as follows .",
    "we first partition the system @xmath0 into subsystems @xmath96 and @xmath97 , so that @xmath98 .",
    "let @xmath99 and @xmath100 be the state spaces for @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively , so that @xmath101 .",
    "our main tool for constructing @xmath95 is a linear map @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the dual of @xmath104 .    according to a standard result in linear algebra , all information about a linear map",
    "is contained in two fundamental spaces associated with it : its kernel and image , @xmath105 associated with the map @xmath106 is the transpose map @xmath107 the matrices of @xmath106 and @xmath108 are the transposes of each other .    introducing inner products in @xmath99 and @xmath100 , we can relate the kernels and images of @xmath106 and @xmath108 through orthogonal compliments , @xmath109 ( the orthogonal complement @xmath110 of a subspace @xmath111 of an inner product space @xmath112 is the set of all vectors in @xmath112 that are orthogonal to every vector in @xmath111 , @xmath113 . )    thus , if both maps are used to construct @xmath95 , then it suffices to consider only their kernels , for example .",
    "we adopt this choice . furthermore ,",
    "since @xmath108 is obtained from @xmath106 by interchanging @xmath99 and @xmath100 , both maps are included by considering only @xmath106 for both @xmath101 and @xmath114 .    for specific computations we need expressions for the above quantities in terms of coordinates .",
    "we introduce these by choosing arbitrary bases @xmath115 and @xmath116 for the spaces @xmath99 and @xmath100 and representing a vector @xmath31 in terms of its coordinates @xmath117 , @xmath118 we find @xmath119 the kernel of a map is found by solving a homogeneous system of linear equations .      to describe properties of @xmath26 related to partitioning the system into any two subsystems , we need to consider all possible subsystems @xmath96 and @xmath97 such that @xmath98 and the corresponding @xmath99 and @xmath100 such that @xmath101 .",

    "we construct the set of new maps @xmath140 from the set of the maps @xmath141 using the operation of the tensor product",
    ". the new maps should be linear in @xmath26 , and it should be possible to compare them with each other , for example , by comparing their kernels .",
    "linearity in @xmath26 requires that the only other maps allowed in the construction are the identity maps .",
    "comparison of the new maps is possible only if their domains coincide , and a natural choice for such a common domain is the space @xmath10 .",
    "these requirements fix the form of the new maps , @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the identity map .",
    "let @xmath144 and @xmath145 for each @xmath129 .",

    "we call elements of @xmath94 algebraic invariants of @xmath26 because they are derived using standard tools of linear algebra .",
