    "the fluid dynamics of dense accretion discs is described by the navier - stokes and magneto - hydrodynamic equations .",
    "within such a description , the microscopic properties of the fluid are parameterized ( in part ) via the kinematic viscosity @xmath7 , which describes the rate at which inter - particle collisions damp fluid motions , and the resistivity @xmath8 , which quantifies the dissipation of currents via ohmic losses .",
    "timescales can be associated with each of these quantities .",
    "the viscous timescale of a disc @xmath9 , for example , is the timescale on which the microscopic viscosity would lead to angular momentum transport over a scale @xmath10 .",
    "as is well known @xcite , for astrophysical discs the timescales for evolution driven by the microscopic viscosity are many orders of magnitude larger than the observed evolution timescales .",
    "it is therefore generally assumed that evolution is driven by an  anomalous \" or  turbulent \" viscosity @xmath11 @xcite , possibly augmented in some cases by angular momentum loss in a wind @xcite . in most astrophysical discs @xmath12 is likely generated from turbulence driven by the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ; see @xcite and references therein ) . since @xmath11 most studies of discs make the implicit assumption that the actual values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are unimportant , and consider instead evolution under the action of the effective transport coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "provided that the reynolds ( @xmath14 ) and magnetic reynolds ( @xmath15 ) numbers are large enough , the absolute value of either one may indeed be of little import for accretion discs .",
    "their ratio , however , which we define as the magnetic prandtl number , @xmath16 is almost certainly _ not _ ignorable @xcite .",
    "an accretion disc serves to convert the large - scale energy present in the shear flow into other energy forms  turbulent kinetic energy , magnetic field , and heat  and the dissipation required to generate heat may vary strongly depending upon the microphysical transport coefficients . in particular , if @xmath17 the plasma is highly viscous on the scale at which resistivity operates .",
    "in this regime one may expect that dissipation of the magnetic field will be suppressed , with a resulting modification in the saturation level of dynamo generated fields and an inverse cascade of magnetic energy to large scales @xcite .",
    "the importance of the magnetic prandtl number for the resulting magnetic field structure has been illustarted analytically @xcite and numerically , both in idealised simulations of dynamo action within forced turbulence @xcite and in local shearing - box simulations of the mri within accretion discs @xcite dynamos is similar .",
    "disc simulations are required , however , to assess the impact of the small - scale physics on mri saturation and the large scale flow properties .",
    "it is unclear whether the shearing - box approach is adequate for study of these effects . ] . for discs",
    "the current limited set of simulations indicates that the efficiency of angular momentum transport , parameterized via the shakura - sunyaev @xmath18 parameter , increases with @xmath19 , and can approach @xmath20 given the combination of modest @xmath21 and a weak net vertical magnetic field .",
    "motivated by these results , @xcite calculated the expected radial variation of @xmath19 within standard shakura - sunyaev models of geometrically thin , radiatively efficient accretion discs .",
    "they found that @xmath19 exceeds unity within @xmath22 schwarzschild radii of the central object , and suggested that the qualitatively different behaviour of the mri in the high @xmath19 limit might be responsible for the time - dependent outbursts and state changes that are observed in x - ray binaries .    in this paper",
    ", we compute the magnitude and radial dependence of the magnetic prandtl number in hyper - accreting discs . such discs , which can support accretion rates of the order of @xmath23 , form from compact object mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and when the cores of rapidly rotating massive stars collapse @xcite .",
    "the disc structure is shaped by neutrino emission in the regions close to the accreting object , while in the outer parts neither neutrinos ( the temperature is too low ) nor photons ( which are trapped within the flow ) can provide cooling .",
    "hyper - accreting discs are invoked to provide the initial energy injection in many models for @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "our ultimate motivation for studying the magnetic prandtl number in these discs is to understand the complex phenomenology ( jets , highly variable prompt emission , x - ray flares , plateau phases etc ) that is observed in grbs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and which may well derive from the evolution of the disc .",
    "we anticipate different results from those found by @xcite for photon - cooled discs . in the neutrino - cooled region",
    "the differences arise from two reasons .",
    "first , since neutrino opacities are vastly smaller than photon opacities , hyper - accreting discs are much cooler and denser than an extrapolation of shakura - sunyaev discs would imply , and this on its own would alter the magnetic prandtl number .",
    "second , the temperatures and densities in hyper - accreting discs are such that the electrons are mildly relativistic and mildly degenerate , while the elastic collision cross - section for the nuclei exceeds the coulomb cross - section . as a consequence ,",
    "the classical @xcite expressions for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which are adequate for ordinary accretion flows , no longer apply .",
    "they do apply , instead , in the outer regions of hyper - accreting discs , where a different @xmath4 behaviour occurs since the flow is radiatively inefficient and photon - pressure dominated .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in  2 through  5",
    "we describe the formalism for calculating the structure of hyper - accreting discs .",
    "this is required here in order to determine consistently the plasma conditions within these discs  including the temperature , density , nuclear composition and degree of degeneracy .",
    "readers familiar with vertically averaged hyper - accreting disc models will find that our approach generally follows standard practice .",
    "the structure of the resulting disc models is presented in  6 . given these conditions ,",
    "we then calculate in  7 and  8 the resisitivity and viscosity in the neutrino cooled inner region of the disc .",
    "these sections contain the principle new results of this paper . combining the viscosity and resistivity ,",
    "we show in  10 that @xmath24 across the entire radial range relevant for grb models . in  11 we estimate the strength of other non - ideal mhd effects , and in  12 we study the structure of the outer non - radiative region of the disc .  13 and  14 discuss and",
    "summarize our results , and what they may imply for disc evolution and grb observables .",
    "we calculate the temperature and density at the midplane of a hyper - accreting disc from vertically averaged thin disc solutions . in hyper - accreting discs",
    "the diffusion time for photons to leak out from the disc is much larger than the accretion time scale ( @xmath25 ) and photons remain trapped .",

    "the temperature in the innermost region exceeds @xmath29 1  mev and neutrino production switches on ( popham , woosley & fryer 1999 ) .",
    "this happens for radii r @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the schwarzschild radius for a black hole of mass @xmath32 .",
    "the neutrino flux liberates the energy deposited locally by viscous ( turbulent ) stresses and consequently the local sound speed @xmath33 remains smaller than the rotational velocity ( @xmath34 ) of the disc .",

    "the surface density is related to the midplane ( @xmath44 ) density via @xmath45 . the radial mass flow @xmath38 [ gr s@xmath27 ] is defined by the continuity equation = - 2 r v_r = constant , where the radial drift velocity @xmath47 is subsonic .",
    "the turbulent kinematic viscosity is parameterized as @xcite , = c_sh .",
    "we emphasise here that the kinematic viscosity @xmath48 is quite different in nature from the  microscopic \" ( also referred to as  molecular \" ) viscosity @xmath7 , that enters into the definition of the magnetic prandtl number .",
    "the first is associated with turbulent flow and magnetic stresses in the plasma , while the second is given by deflection of ions and electrons by particle - particle collisions in the plasma .    for a thin disk both radial advection of energy and flux in the radial direction",
    "can typically be neglected ( we justify this for our case later ) . from energy conservation",

    "numerical simulations suggest that in low @xmath4 discs resistive dissipation ultimately sets the saturation level ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if , however , the small - scale dissipation of magnetic fields is frustrated by a high magnetic prandtl number , the only channel available to limit the flux may be macroscopic buoyancy . since buoyancy is relatively inefficient  the timescale is likely to modestly exceed the alfvn crossing time @xmath278 of the disc  a high magnetic prandtl number disc could saturate at a level that involves stronger magnetic fields , more vigorous turbulence and angular momentum transport , and ongoing field expulsion .",
    "these expectations are supported by the available numerical evidence . @xcite and @xcite",
    "find that the parameter @xmath18 increases with the magnetic prandtl number in the range @xmath279 and @xmath280 . in the case",

    "based on these arguments , two evolutionary consequences can be contemplated for hyper - accreting discs formed after stellar core collapse or compact object mergers . in the initial phase ,",
    "a high magnetic prandtl number in the neutrino cooled inner disc results in stronger magnetic field and a higher efficiency of angular momentum transport .",
    "since , as we have shown , a _ higher _ @xmath18 in such discs results in a yet _ higher _ @xmath4 , a runaway occurs until @xmath20 .",
    "this regime is sustainable for many dynamical timescales , provided that the excess magnetic energy that could quench the mri is removed from the disc , for example , by buoyancy .",
    "this is plausible since close to equipartition the buoyancy timescale @xmath281 is similar to the orbital timescale and can provide cooling by removing magnetic energy in which a fixed fraction of the cooling occurs non - radiatively via loss of magnetic energy .",

    "turbulent diffusion can depend in turn on the strength of the magnetic field and on non - linear mhd effects . in our case",
    "the dominance of the hall effect may influence the behaviour of the turbulence , by introducing an asymmetry between magnetic fields that are aligned or anti - aligned with the direction of the angular momentum vector @xcite .",

    "greater _ than unity , unless the angular momentum transport efficiency , parameterized via the shakura - sunyaev @xmath18 , is very small ( @xmath286 ) .",
    "@xmath4 ranges between a few tens to a few @xmath68 , and it typically increases with @xmath18 . in the optically _ thin _ regions for neutrinos , the main dependence of @xmath4 is on density ( inversely , via viscosity ) since the disc temperature varies very slowly as a function of @xmath38 and radius .",

    "we conclude by noting a number of implications for the global structure of hyper - accreting discs :    * for all plausible values of the magnetic field strength in the disc , the hall effect provides the largest non - ideal term in the mhd equations .",
    "these discs are perhaps a unique example of a high magnetic reynolds number flow in which the hall effect is the dominant non - ideal term .",
    "since there are no simulations where these conditions are accounted for , their effect on the magnetic field evolution and mri is unclear . *",
    "the large values of the magnetic prandtl number mean that the evolution of magnetic field within hyper - accreting discs is likely to be qualitatively different from discs with lower magnetic prandtl numbers .",

    "numerical simulations of hyper - accreting discs that do not account for microphysical dissipation may therefore have underestimated the magnetic field strength . *",
    "the _ immediate _ consequence of a high value of @xmath4 for models of the central engines of grbs is that disc formation is likely to be accompanied by vigorous expulsion of magnetic flux .",

    "<S> hyper - accreting discs occur in compact - object mergers and in collapsed cores of massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> they power the central engine of @xmath0-ray bursts in most scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the microphysical dissipation ( the viscosity and resistivity ) of plasma in these discs , and discuss the implications for their global structure and evolution . at the temperatures ( @xmath1 ) and densities ( @xmath2 ) characteristic of the neutrino - cooled innermost regions , </S>",
    "<S> the viscosity is provided mainly by mildly degenerate electrons , while the resistivity is modified from the spitzer value due to the effects of both relativity and degeneracy . under these conditions </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic reynolds number is very large ( @xmath3 ) and the plasma behaves as an almost ideal magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) fluid . among the possible non - ideal mhd effects the hall term is relatively the most important , while the magnetic prandtl number , @xmath4 ( the ratio of viscosity to resistivity ) , is typically larger than unity : @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> inspection of the outer radiatively inefficient regions indicates similar properties , with magnetic prandtl numbers as high as @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations of the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) indicate that the saturation level and angular momentum transport efficiency may be greatly enhanced at high prandtl numbers . </S>",
    "<S> if this behaviour persists in the presence of a strong hall effect we would expect that hyper - accreting discs should be strongly magnetised and highly variable . </S>",
    "<S> the expulsion of magnetic field that can not be dissipated at small scales may also favour a magnetic outflow . </S>",
    "<S> we note that there are limited similaries between hyper - accreting discs and x - ray binary discs  which also have a high magnetic prandtl number close to the black hole  which suggests that a comparison between late - time activity in @xmath0-ray bursts and x - ray binary accretion states may be fruitful . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , our results imply that the possibly different character of high prandtl number mhd flows needs to be considered in studies and numerical simulations of hyper - accreting discs .    </S>",
