    "tooth - like modulations termed superhumps are visible . the mean period of the superhump are a few percent longer than that of the orbital period , which are believed to be caused by phase - dependent tidal dissipation of the eccentrically - deformed precessing accretion disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    ".    why is @xmath0 band faint before an outburst ?",
    "one possibility is that inner portion of the accretion disk is filled by matter , which obscures the flux from the white dwarf",
    ". if this is the case , then line profiles in balmer series such as h@xmath29 and h@xmath30 should change before an outburst ; wing velocities will increase because of the existence of the inner matter .",

    "in order to clarify the nature of the faintness in @xmath0 band , spectroscopic observations prior to outburst should be performed .",
    "one of the most significant findings in our observations is that we confirm the presence of bright quiescence in su uma itself .",
    "it is well known that , after the end of superoutburst , su uma - type dwarf novae keeps brighter magnitudes compared with those of the majority of quiescence ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite noted that this is associated with cooling of the white dwarf heated by a superoutburst @xcite , although the slow decay in v344 lyr for about 50 days after a superoutburst mentioned in cannizzo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) might be due to a purely instrumental effect accompanied by repositioning of @xmath11 spacecraft ( see  2.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that the white dwarf of gw lib was heated by the 2007 superoutburst and has not returned to the quiescent state .",
    "therefore one can expect that appearance of bright quiescence is restricted in the vicinity of the termination of the superoutburst .",
    "the present observations , however , show that appearance of bright quiescence is independent of superoutburst .",
    "in addition , the durations of bright quiescence tend to be shorter compared to those of faint quiescence .",
    "although the reason for entering bright quiescence should await further observations , it may attribute to the accretion disk itself , rather than the heated white dwarf .",
    "regarding light curves , they show complicated profiles with various time scales and magnitudes . as mentioned the previous section , no significant signals corresponding to the orbital period",
    "were detected in the pdm analyses .",
    "this implies that the main light source may be originated from a complicated structure of the accretion disk , rather than the hot spot .",
    "color variations and light curves correlate well each other : the maxima of the light curves coincide with the blue peaks of @xmath16 .",
    "this differs from those observed in superhumps , in which the blue peaks of @xmath16 is prior to the bright maxima of @xmath1 band by phase @xmath3 0.2 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite noted that such behavior is associated with the heating and expansion in the accretion disk . from this standpoint ,",
    "the present result implies that these processes are marginal during quiescence .",
    "as noted in the previous section , su uma exhibited five normal outbursts during our observations .",
    "the bright maxima occurred on 14 , 35 , 46 , 63 , and 77 d from the epoch of our observations , by which we roughly estimated recurrence times as 21 , 11 , 17 , and 14 d. according to the original thermal - tidal instability , the recurrence time of normal outburst increases with the supercycle phase @xcite .",
    "however , the present observations show that no regularity exists in the recurrence times of the normal outbursts .",
    "similar trend can be also seen in the @xmath11 light curves of v344 lyr and v1504 cyg , in which the duration of quiescence ranges from 3 d to 20 d. so far , our obtained data can not lead to a conclusion why su uma shows various durations of quiescence .",
    "as displayed in figure [ 1214 ] , we succeeded in observing the very onset of the outburst , in which the light curve showed hump - like modulations with a period of 0.048111(354 ) d. if these modulations are linked to the keplerian motion of the accretion disk , then the light source is originated from @xmath3 0.7@xmath33 , where @xmath33 denotes the binary separation .",
    "this value is far beyond the tidal truncation radius of the accretion disk of su uma .",
    "it is unlikely to be the case either that these are associated with the hot spot , since no sign of the orbital period is detected . at present ,",
    "the origin of the modulations and periodicity is unclear . in order to clarify the physical mechanism of these modulations ,",
    "further photometric data before the onset of an outburst should be collected .",
    "( 160mm,160mm)figure11.eps    ( 160mm,160mm)figure12.eps      one of the purposes of our observations is to study negative superhumps of su uma - type dwarf novae . as noted in the previous section , our pdm analyses imply the signals shorter than the orbital period of the system .",
    "@xcite noted that negative superhumps show coherent light curves with a slow rise and rapid decline , like figure 8 of their paper .",
    "@xcite reported that appearance and disappearance of negative superhumps may be triggered by an outburst , based on period analyses on v344 lyr .",
    "in conjunction with these results , it may be premature to conclude that we detect negative superhumps , even though the theta diagrams imply the periodicities shorter than the orbital period .",
    "although we are less confident on detection of negative superhumps , our result does not mean that su uma shows any negative superhumps at all .",
    "for example , v344 lyr and v1504 cyg exhibited negative superhumps for only 150 d and 260 d against more than 600 d data ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . taking these facts into consideration ,",
    "our observations are too short to conclude whether su uma shows negative superhumps .",
    "as noted in @xcite , su uma experienced unusual states in the past ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . according to @xcite ,",
    "su uma hardly showed outbursts for about 3 years , despite the fact that a mean supercycle of su uma being @xmath3 1 year .",
    "in addition , su uma occasionally entered long quiescence with durations of longer than 50 d @xcite . recently , many authors point out that appearance of negative superhumps suppress an outburst ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . based on these ideas ,",
    "we speculate that such a long quiescence might be associated with negative superhumps . this should be investigated by further quiescent photometry not only for su uma itself , but also for other su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "in this paper , we summarize our results as follows :    \\1 .",
    "quiescence is divided into two types according to the magnitude : faint quiescence and bright quiescence .",
    "the latter is further divided into two types based on @xmath4 color . during bright quiescence ,",
    "the averaged magnitude is @xmath23 0.5 mag brighter than that of faint quiescence .",
    "the obtained light curves varied with the amplitude as large as @xmath23 1 mag with irregular and incoherent profiles . although our period analyses imply the periodicities shorter than the orbital period , it is premature to conclude that we detect negative superhumps .    \\3 . during our photometric campaign ,",
    "su uma experienced five normal outbursts , of which three were successfully observed .",
    "these outbursts are characteristic of the outside - in type . at the rising phase of the stage",
    "b outburst , hump - like modulations were visible at a period of @xmath3 0.048111(354 ) d. the origin of this period remains unknown .",
    "daily - averaged color - color indices of su uma revealed two cycles : outburst @xmath26 bright quiescence @xmath26 outburst , and outburst @xmath26 faint quiescence ( blue ) @xmath26 faint quiescence ( red ) @xmath26 outburst .",
    "this suggests that the thermal limit cycle of the accretion disk for su uma is more complicated .",
    "\\5 . the color index in @xmath4 becomes redder @xmath3 3 days prior to an outburst .",
    "one possibility is that the inner portion of the accretion disk is filled by gas , which obscures the central white dwarf .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that the stagnation effect works at the onset of the outburst .",
    "the physical mechanism on this reddening should be elucidated in future observations .",
    "we would like to thank an anonymous referee for helpful comments on the manuscript of this paper .",
