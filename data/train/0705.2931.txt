    "by utilizing shared entanglement and classical communication , quantum teleportation @xcite enables one , in principle , to transfer arbitrary quantum states with unit fidelity . in a realistic scenario ,",
    "typically , a receiver obtains an imperfect version of the sender s state .",
    "if the receiver decides to teleport his approximate version to a third party , the original quantum state will further degrade when it arrives at the final destination .",
    "such a sequential quantum teleportation therefore requires a sufficiently good performance of each individual teleporter ; otherwise the finally teleported state would hardly resemble the input state .",
    "most protocols for quantum information processing and their experimental realizations are based upon either discrete qubit / qudit or continuous phase - space variables . in quantum optical implementations ,",
    "typically , the single - photon - based qubit approach suffers from rather low efficiencies , but achieves , in principle , near - unit fidelities .",
    "combining several single - photon teleporters @xcite would , in principle , still result in very good fidelities , though conditioned upon coinciding detection events at very low success rates .",
    "conversely , when gaussian resource states and continuous - variable homodyne measurements are used , _ unconditional operations lead to , in principle , near - unit efficiencies , even when basic subroutines such as quantum teleportation are concatenated_. the continuous - variable approach @xcite , however , as it relies on intrinsically imperfect squeezed - state entanglement , will never result in arbitrarily high fidelities . in continuous - variable ( cv )",
    "quantum teleportation @xcite , the teleported state is a noisy replica of the input state , with an excess noise depending on the quality of the squeezed entanglement resource .",
    "therefore , when quantum information is sequentially manipulated through gaussian resources , for instance , via a sequence of teleportation circuits in a continuous - variable cluster computation @xcite , the unwanted excess noise accumulates and leads to increasingly deteriorating fidelities .",
    "in order to achieve still better than classical fidelities , it is thus crucial to improve the quality of each individual teleporter .",
    "so far , a variety of ( unsequential ) quantum teleportation protocols have been demonstrated , for instance , with photonic qubits @xcite , optical field modes @xcite , between atoms @xcite , and even between light and atoms @xcite . since the first realization of cv quantum teleportation of optical coherent states @xcite , several related experiments have followed @xcite .",
    "the cv quantum teleporter can be characterized by the fidelity @xmath3 for an input state @xmath4 and a teleported state @xmath5 .",
    "if the input state is a coherent state , @xmath6 , the total fidelity for a sequence of @xmath7 quantum teleportations may be described by @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the squeezing parameter of the ( equally ) entangled , standard two - mode squeezed - state resources . in the case of @xmath10 , at least @xmath11 is required ( corresponding to two @xmath12 teleporters ) in order to surpass the classical limit @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "in the present work , we demonstrate an experiment of two sequential quantum teleportations of optical coherent states .",
    "the input states are teleported from a sender ( `` alice 1 '' ) to a first receiver ( `` bob 1 '' ) and could be retrieved there , as we verify through fidelity measurements . in a second round of teleportation ,",
    "the output states of the first teleporter are then transferred from bob 1 ( now acting as `` alice 2 '' ) to a second receiver ( `` bob 2 '' ) where they can be verified again via fidelity measurements . as we use two high - fidelity teleporters ,",
    "the total fidelity of the output states is still well beyond the classical limit , despite the excess noise accumulated during the two rounds of quantum teleportation . during the entire protocol ,",
    "none of the participants ( the alice s and bob s ) gain any substantial information about the input state , though they do obtain some partial knowledge because of the non - maximal degree of entanglement of the finitely squeezed states used for teleportation .",
    "based on these results , one could sequentially communicate coherent signal states over two different segments of a channel , provided the corresponding amount of entanglement is available in each channel segment . for realistic , noisy channels",
    ", this would require entanglement distillation ( purification ) procedures @xcite performed prior to the teleportations . in general ,",
    "however , by dividing a communication channel into shorter segments @xcite , a higher degree of entanglement can be maintained in each segment and entanglement distillation will be more efficient . via sequential quantum teleportation , quantum information can then be sent to an intermediate station where it could be either retrieved or passed on to the next station .",
    "if the total communication channel covers a large distance ( e.g. , 1000 km ) , it will be necessary to connect some of the purified entangled states via entanglement swapping @xcite and repurify the resulting states @xcite .",
    "using various levels of purification and swapping enables one to cover a larger distance compared to sequential quantum teleportation .",
    "however , after entanglement swapping , quantum information can no longer be transferred to the intermediate stations and potentially retrieved there . as a consequence , in cv entanglement swapping @xcite , resource requirements are less demanding and , in principle , any nonzero squeezing value of the initial two - mode squeezed states results in a swapped entangled state sufficient for @xmath14 quantum teleportation of coherent states @xcite ( as opposed to the @xmath15 squeezing limit in sequential quantum teleportation ) . a comparison between these related schemes is shown in fig .  1 .    concerning quantum computation rather than communication , measurement - based schemes",
    "@xcite have been shown to be an interesting alternative to the more traditional circuit - based approach .",
    "the present experiment is also a first step towards a sequential , measurement - based manipulation of quantum information during its propagation through an efficient gaussian resource state @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the current sequential teleportation scheme with a protocol in which an input state is sent through a linear gaussian cluster state is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the quantum state to be teleported here is that of an electromagnetic field mode .",
    "an electromagnetic field mode is represented by an annihilation operator @xmath16 with real and imaginary parts @xmath17 and @xmath18 corresponding to the `` position '' and `` momentum '' quadrature - phase amplitude operators .",
    "these operators @xmath17 and @xmath18 satisfy the commutation relation @xmath19 = i/2 $ ] ( units - free , with @xmath20 ) .    in our experiment ,",
    "the input state is a coherent state for an optical sideband at 1 mhz .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "in order to generate squeezed vacuum states , we use four subthreshold optical parametric oscillators ( opos ) with a periodically poled ktiopo@xmath21 as a nonlinear medium @xcite .",
    "an output of cw ti : sapphire laser at 860 nm is frequency doubled in an external cavity with a potassium niobate crystal .",
    "the output beam at 430 nm is divided into four beams to pump the four opos .",
    "the pump powers are about 90mw . by combining two squeezed - vacuum states at a symmetric beam splitter",
    ", we can generate an entangled two - mode squeezed ( `` epr '' ) state . using four squeezed vacuum states ,",
    "we generate two pairs of epr beams in order to construct two teleporters .        in the following ,",
    "we describe the teleportation process in the heisenberg representation .",
    "initially , the sender alice and the receiver bob share a pair of epr beams .",
    "alice performs a joint measurement on her epr mode ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) and the input mode ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) .",
    "she combines these two modes at a symmetric beam splitter and measures @xmath26 and @xmath27 with two homodyne detectors .",
    "the measurement results ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) are then sent to bob through classical channels with gain @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the ( normalized ) gains of the classical channels are adjusted similar to ref . @xcite and defined as @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the adjusted gains for the teleporters 1 and 2 are @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , respectively . for simplicity ,",
    "these gains are fixed throughout the experiment and treated as unity .",
    "bob receives alice s measurement results ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) through the classical channels and displaces his epr beam ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) accordingly , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in our experiment ,",
    "the displacement operations are realized via electro - optical modulators ( eoms ) and highly reflecting mirrors ( 99/1 beam splitters ) .",
    "bob modulates two beams by using amplitude and phase modulators , corresponding to the displacement of @xmath42 and @xmath43 quadratures , respectively .",
    "the modulated beams are combined with bob s mode ( @xmath44 , @xmath39 ) at the 99/1 beam splitters .",
    "the teleported mode can be written as @xcite @xmath45 ideally , the epr beams would have perfect correlations such that @xmath46 and @xmath47 . hence , the state of the output mode , expressed by @xmath48 and @xmath49 , would coincide with that of the input mode , @xmath24 and @xmath50 .",
    "in the real experiment , the teleported state has some additional noise due to the finite epr correlations , i.e. , @xmath51 ^ 2\\right \\rangle \\neq 0 $ ] and @xmath52 ^ 2\\right \\rangle \\neq 0 $ ] . in the process of @xmath7 sequential quantum teleportations , this excess noise is added @xmath7 times to the input state .",
    "thus , the variances of the output state are @xmath53 where @xmath54 are the added noise terms of the @xmath55-th teleporter .",
    "3 shows the measurement results of the two sequential quantum teleportations .",
    "the outputs of the homodyne detection are measured by a spectrum analyzer .",
    "the measurement frequency is 1 mhz .",
    "3 ( a ) shows the input coherent state with the phase scanned . in our experiment ,",
    "an input coherent state is generated by modulating a weak coherent beam at 1 mhz .",
    "3 ( b ) shows the teleported states for the @xmath42 quadrature ( the @xmath43 quadrature is not shown ) .",
    "the variances of the teleported state are @xmath56 db and @xmath57 db relative to the vacuum noise level",
    ". here superscript @xmath58 stands for the output of the first teleporter . fig .",
    "3 ( c ) shows sequentially teleported states for the @xmath42 quadrature ( the @xmath43 quadrature is not shown ) .",
    "the variances of the sequentially teleported state are @xmath59 db and @xmath60 db .",
    "note that the amplitudes of the teleported states are almost identical to those of the input states , reassuring that the gains of the teleporters are near unity .",
    "we also evaluate the performance of the second teleporter individually ( not shown in fig .",
    "we teleport a coherent state by using the second teleporter , and determine the variances of the output .",
    "the measured variances of the output state are @xmath61 db and @xmath62 db with respect to the vacuum noise level . from eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we can calculate the variance of the sequentially teleported state from the added noise of each teleporter .",
    "the calculated variances are @xmath63 db and @xmath64 db , which is in good agreement with the experimental results .",
    "this confirms that our teleporters maintain their fidelities even when combining them . in principle",
    ", we can build a larger sequence of teleporters ( though at the expense of a further decreasing total fidelity ) .",
    "to estimate the performance of a teleporter , we use the fidelity @xmath65 for teleporting a coherent state with amplitude @xmath66 yielding the output state @xmath67 . for coherent - state inputs with unity gains ,",

    "the variances of the coherent state input is @xmath69 , hence the fidelity can be determined by the added noise of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we calculate the fidelity from the measured variances using eq .",
    "the performance of each teleporter is estimated for a coherent - state input as @xmath0 and @xmath1 for teleporters 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "note that our teleporters exceed both the classical limit @xmath13 @xcite and the no - cloning limit @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "we also calculate the fidelity between the input and the sequentially teleported state .",
    "the fidelity is @xmath2 which still exceeds the classical limit @xmath13 and verifies the successful demonstration of two sequential quantum teleportations .",
    "4 shows the wigner functions reconstructed via optical homodyne tomography technique @xcite .",
    "the wigner function is a quasi - probability distribution defined by @xmath73 @xcite . in optical homodyne tomography , we also use 1 mhz sidebands of the carrier beam @xcite .",
    "the output of a homodyne detector is high - pass filtered and then mixed with an electrical oscillator signal of frequency 1 mhz , which is the same frequency as for the creation of the input coherent state .",
    "the intermediate - frequency output of the mixer is low - pass filtered ( the bandwidth is 30 khz ) and recorded in a pc with an analogue - to - digital converter ( adc ) .",
    "the sampling rate of the adc is set to 300 khz and we measure around 100,000 points with the local oscillator ( lo ) phase scanned . to reconstruct the wigner function",

    "that here we lock the phase of the input coherent state to @xmath74 with respect to the @xmath42 quadrature .",
    "although the teleported states have excess noise and turn into mixed states , the input state is clearly reconstructed after the two rounds of quantum teleportation .",
    "in summary , we demonstrated two sequential quantum teleportations of coherent states of light .",
    "the experimentally determined fidelity for the sequentially teleported coherent states was well beyond the classical limit .",
    "these results imply the possibility of sequential quantum communication over several segments of a channel using efficient gaussian resources ( combined with non - gaussian distillation techniques @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , our experiment represents a first step towards sequentially manipulating quantum information using entangled gaussian resource states .",
    "future extensions of this work will include more general measurement - based gaussian transformations @xcite and the use of non - gaussian signal states as well as the addition of non - gaussian measurements in order to achieve universal quantum information processing @xcite .",
