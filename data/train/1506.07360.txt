    "out - of - equilibrium quantum systems have received much attention in the past few decades , both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "a major goal is to understand the transport of charge and energy through molecular or nanoscale systems coupled to reservoirs such that voltages and temperature gradients can be applied .",
    "while there exist powerful numerical and analytical methods to calculate ground state and finite temperature properties of isolated interacting quantum systems , the situation becomes much more involved when these systems are coupled to reservoirs and driven out of equilibrium , even in the case when a stationary state is reached @xcite . due to these difficulties most of the previous studies",
    "have been restricted to single site models like the spinless interacting resonant level model ( irlm ) or the single impurity anderson model , and the main focus was on the zero temperature @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics , in particular in the linear regime .",
    "a variety of methods , both numerical and analytical , have been applied like , e.g. , the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( tddmrg ) @xcite , non - equilibrium green s functions @xcite , the time evolving block decimation method @xcite , iterated summation of the path integral @xcite , and time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) @xcite .",
    "while in the meir - wingreen approach @xcite the problem is formally solved , for interacting models it is generally not possible to evaluate the various green s functions needed as input without further approximations . in the purely numerical methods there",
    "exist severe limitations with respect to size and dimensionality of the systems that can be studied , and even for single site models the approaches are computationally very expensive .    in the present study we utilize the hartree - fock approximation in order to calculate the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics of a spinless fermion model that can be seen as a generalization of the irlm to several sites .",
    "the obvious advantages of this method are the relatively low computational costs compared to numerically exact approaches , and the great flexibility with respect to dimensionality , system size and geometry , finite temperature , and type and range of interactions . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that hf calculations for isolated systems in the ground state or in thermal equilibrium tend to overestimate the appearance of spurious broken symmetry phases .",
    "therefore it is most important to benchmark the results against exact solutions .",
    "the purpose of this study is to assess the reliability of the hf approach in the non - equilibrium setting in comparison with available exact results .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional model of spinless fermions , where @xmath2 central sites ( the molecule ) with nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath3 are coupled to a left and a right lead of @xmath4 and @xmath5 non - interacting sites .",
    "the hopping parameter @xmath6 is , for simplicity , chosen to be the same in the leads and within the molecule , while the coupling between the leads and the molecule is described by a hopping parameter @xmath7 and a nearest neighbor interaction @xmath8 .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath9 with @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "the sites @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the first and the last sites of the molecule , respectively ( see fig .  1 ) , and the system size is @xmath14 .    ) for @xmath15 and @xmath16.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the charge currents between the leads and the molecule can be obtained from the equation of motion in the heisenberg picture . assuming that each fermion carries the charge @xmath17 , the charge current operator from the left lead into the molecule",
    "is given by @xmath18 = -ie t ' ( \\hat c^\\dagger_{a } \\hat c^{}_{a+1 } - \\hat c^\\dagger_{a+1 } \\hat c^{}_{a } ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the number of particles in the left lead , and @xmath20 is set to one .",
    "correspondingly , the operator of the current from the molecule into the right lead reads @xmath21",

    "there are two different schemes that have been proposed in the literature @xcite to simulate a non - equilibrium condition . in the first setting the molecule",
    "is initially considered non - interacting and decoupled from the leads , and each of the three isolated subsystems is assumed to be in grand canonical thermal equilibrium at its own temperature and chemical potential . at time",
    "@xmath23 the interaction is switched on , and the molecule and the leads are connected by adding @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the time evolution of the system is then governed by the full hamiltonian . for",
    "sufficiently long leads one expects that after a transient phase a stationary state arises where the current is time - independent , and the goal is to calculate this steady state current as function of the applied temperature and voltage bias .    in the second scheme one",
    "considers a situation where initially the leads and the molecule are coupled and in thermal equilibrium at the same temperature and chemical potential . at time @xmath26 a voltage @xmath1 is applied by adding different potentials @xmath27 to the leads .",
    "subsequently , the time evolution is governed by the full hamiltonian _ including _ the voltage bias .",
    "the stationary currents thus obtained coincide with the ones of the first quench scheme as long as the applied potential is much smaller than the band width of the leads @xcite .",
    "however , for larger voltages there are significant differences in the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics . while in the partitioned scheme the current approaches a finite value in the limit @xmath28 , in the second scheme it goes to zero when the potential difference exceeds the band width .",
    "since it is not clear how to realize a well - defined temperature bias in the second setting , and since we want to retain the possibility to treat both voltage and temperature gradients we use the first scheme for our calculations . the merits and shortcomings of both quench schemes have been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "generally , the state of a quantum mechanical system is described by the density matrix @xmath29 . in our case",
    "each subsystem @xmath30 l , c , r is initially in thermal equilibrium with inverse temperature @xmath31 and chemical potential @xmath32 , and the density matrix reads @xmath33 where @xmath34 is determined from the condition @xmath35 .",
    "the time - evolution of the density matrix is determined through @xmath36 in order to calculate time - dependent expectation values of observables , like the current , one has to compute the equal - time green s function defined as @xmath37 for non - interacting systems , i.e. , when the hamiltonian @xmath38 contains only bilinear combinations of the fermi operators , @xmath39 can be obtained from the equation of motion @xmath40 , % g(t ) = { \\rm e}^{iht } g(0 ) { \\rm e}^{-iht}\\ ] ] where the matrix @xmath41 is defined by @xmath42 equation  ( [ eqofmotion ] ) is valid also for time - dependent but non - interacting hamiltonians .",
    "expectation values of arbitrary products of fermi operators can be expressed in terms of the green s function @xmath43 by applying wick s theorem .",
    "therefore , once the matrix @xmath41 is numerically diagonalized , it is straightforward to calculate time - dependent charge currents for arbitrary times .",
    "when interactions are taken into account the task of determining the time - evolution of the density matrix becomes much more involved .",
    "exact solutions for interacting systems out of equilibrium are extremely rare and limited to very special points in the parameter space of the considered model , e.g. , the self dual point @xmath44 of the irlm @xcite .",
    "a rather simple and physically intuitive approximation arises from the hartree - fock decoupling of the interaction terms in the hamiltonian , @xmath45 as a result , the time - evolution of the density matrix is governed by a non - interacting but time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath46 , and the equation of motion for the one - particle density matrix reads @xmath47 .\\ ] ] this equation of motion can be solved numerically with arbitrary precision using the short - time propagation @xmath48 and choosing sufficiently small time steps @xmath49 .",
    "so far , we have discussed the time - evolution of the system starting from a given initial state in order to extract the transport properties from the stationary state that emerges in the course of time . as an alternative , one can use an approach that allows one to calculate the stationary currents directly without considering explicitly the time - evolution .",
    "formally this is achieved by the meir - wingreen approach @xcite , based on the non - equilibrium green s function formalism . for an effectively non - interacting system like @xmath46 their result for the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation is equivalent to the landauer formula @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the stationary state green s function @xmath50 can be expressed in terms of scattering states as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the eigenstate of @xmath53 that corresponds to an incoming wave from lead @xmath30 l , r with wave number @xmath54 , and @xmath55 with @xmath56 is the fermi function that accounts for the thermal occupation of the states within each lead .",
    "explicitly , up to a normalization constant the plane wave scattering state originating in the left lead is given by @xmath57 and @xmath58 with @xmath59 . here",
    "we have assumed for simplicity that the wave functions in both leads are continued periodically up to infinity , and that @xmath60 .",
    "numerically it is straightforward to connect the plane wave ansatz ( [ scattering ] ) in the left and right lead by solving the schrdinger equation for the hf hamiltonian within the molecule . since @xmath53 itself depends on the equal - time green s function , eq .",

    "in contrast to the non - interacting case , here @xmath63 is not only a function of the energy , but depends also on the voltage and the temperature of the leads due to the self - consistency condition .      if the number of interacting sites is small , ideally if there is only interaction across a single link of neighboring sites as it is the case for @xmath16 and @xmath64 , it is possible to calculate the time - dependent density matrix @xmath65 exactly with moderate numerical effort .",
    "the starting point is to write the time evolution operator @xmath66 as a product of @xmath67 short - time evolution operators , @xmath68 with @xmath69 . for small @xmath49",
    "one may further split each exponential by dividing @xmath70 into non - interacting contributions @xmath71 and interaction terms @xmath72 . using the symmetric trotter breakup , one obtains @xmath73 with an error of @xmath74 .",
    "finally , each exponential containing @xmath72 can be replaced by a sum over an ising variable @xmath75 using hirsch s discrete hubbard - stratonovich decoupling @xcite @xmath76 with @xmath77 . applying this transformation to both exponentials in eq .",

    "perturbative calculations @xcite for the irlm away from the self - dual point @xmath44 indicate that there exists a nonvanishing contribution @xmath86 to the backscattered nonlinear conductance although with a reduced weight compared to the noninteracting system .    for larger voltages ,",

    "can also be observed in the time - evolution of the current displayed in fig .  3 for @xmath82 and several voltages close to the jump .",
    "while for voltages below the transition ( red curves ) the stationary state is reached quite fast and the plateau values increase with voltage , there is a quite strong reduction of the stationary current within a very small range of voltages , and it takes much longer for the system to reach the non - equilibrium steady state .",

    "remarkably , at higher voltages there is a strong and for @xmath119 even discontinuous increase of the current such that all curves nearly collapse in the large voltage regime .    in order to check",
    "if the strong increase of the currents in the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics is an artifact of the hf approximation , we have calculated the exact time - dependent currents using the hubbard - stratonovich approach described in section 2.4 for shorter leads ( @xmath113 ) .",

    "this observation is in contrast to what we found for the irlm where the hf data were in reasonable agreement with the analytical results both for small and for large voltages , see fig .  2 .",
    "interestingly , the discontinuity of the currents appearing in the @xmath0-@xmath1 diagram for sufficiently strong interaction and low temperature can be associated with the existence of multiple solutions of the self - consistent hf equation . in fig .",
    "8 the currents obtained from the iterative solution of the hf equation and the stationary current taken from the time - evolution are shown in a small range of voltages close to the jump . performing the iteration for voltages that increase by small steps one obtains an @xmath0-@xmath1-curve that jumps from a low to a high current branch at a voltage of @xmath124 while in the opposite direction",

    "however , the self - consistent approach sometimes allows for multiple solutions which leads to hysteretic behavior when the voltage is varied adiabatically .",
