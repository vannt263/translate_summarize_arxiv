    "inasmuch as studies of the interaction between a particle and a quantum field are basic to particle physics and field theory , understanding the interaction between an atom and a quantum field is essential to current atomic and optical physics research @xcite .",
    "the interaction of an accelerated charge or detector ( an object with some internal degrees of freedom such as an atom or harmonic oscillator ) in a quantum field is a simple yet fundamental problem with many implications in quantum field theory @xcite , thermodynamics @xcite and applications in radiation theory and atomic - optical physics .",
    "it is common knowledge that accelerating charges give rise to radiation @xcite .",
    "but it is not entirely straightforward to derive the radiation formula from quantum field theory .",
    "how are vacuum fluctuations related to the emitted radiation ?",
    "when an atom or detector moves at constant acceleration , according to unruh @xcite , it would experience a thermal bath at temperature @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the proper acceleration .",
    "is there emitted radiation with an energy flux in the unruh effect ?",
    "unruh effect , and the related effect for moving mirrors studied by davies and fulling @xcite , were intended originally to mimic hawking radiation from black holes .",
    "because of this connection , for some time now there has been a speculation that there is real radiation emitted from a uniformly accelerated detector ( uad ) under steady state conditions ( i.e. , for atoms which have been uniformly accelerated for a time sufficiently long that transient effects have died out ) , not unlike that of an accelerating charge @xcite . in light of pending experiments both for electrons in accelerators @xcite and for accelerated atoms in optical cavities @xcite this speculation has acquired some realistic significance .",
    "there is a need for more detailed analysis for both the uniform acceleration of charges or detectors and for transient motions because the latter can produce radiation and as explained below , sudden changes in the dynamics can also produce emitted radiation with thermal characteristics .",
    "after unruh and wald s @xcite earlier explication of what a minkowski observer sees , grove @xcite questioned whether an accelerated atom actually emits radiated energy .",
    "raine , sciama and grove @xcite ( rsg ) analyzed what an inertial observer placed in the forward light cone of the accelerating detector would measure and concluded that the oscillator does not radiate .",
    "unruh @xcite , in an independent calculation , basically concurred with the findings of rsg but he also showed the existence of extra terms in the two - point function of the field which would contribute to the excitation of a detector placed in the forward light cone .",
    "massar , parantani and brout @xcite ( mpb ) pointed out that the missing terms in rsg contribute to a  polarization cloud \" around the accelerating detector . for a review of earlier work on accelerated detectors ,",
    "see e.g. , @xcite . for work after that ,",
    "see , e.g. , hinterleitner @xcite , audretsch , mller and holzmann @xcite , massar and parantani @xcite .",
    "our present work follows the vein of raval , hu , anglin ( rha ) and koks @xcite on the minimal coupling model and uses some results of lin @xcite on the unruh - dewitt model @xcite .    with regard to the question  is there a radiation flux emitted from an unruh detector ? \"",
    "the findings of rsg , unruh , mpb , rha and others show that , at least in ( 1 + 1 ) dimension model calculations , _ there is no emitted radiation from a linear uniformly accelerated oscillator under equilibrium conditions _ , even though , as found before , that there exists a polarization cloud around it .",
    "hu and johnson @xcite emphasized the difference between an equilibrium condition ( steady state uniform acceleration ) where there is no emitted radiation , and nonequilibrium conditions where there could be radiation emitted .",
    "nonequilibrium conditions arise for non - uniformly accelerated atoms ( for an example of finite time acceleration , see raval , hu and koks ( rhk ) @xcite ) , or during the initial transient time for an atom approaching uniform acceleration , when its internal states have not yet reached equilibrium through interaction with the field .",
    "hu and raval ( hr ) @xcite presented a more complete analysis of the two - point function , calculated for two points lying in arbitrary regions of minkowski space .",
    "this generalizes the results of mpb in that there is no restriction for the two points to lie to the left of the accelerated oscillator trajectory .",
    "they show where the extra terms in the two - point function are which were ignored in the rsg analysis . more important to answering the theme question ,",
    "they show that at least in ( 1 + 1 ) dimension the stress - energy tensor vanishes everywhere except on the horizon .",
    "this means that there is no net flux of radiation emitted from the uniformly accelerated oscillator in steady state in ( 1 + 1)d case .",
    "most prior theoretical work on this topic was done in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional spacetimes .",
    "however since most experimental proposals on the detection of unruh effect are designed for the physical four dimensional spacetime , it is necessary to do a detailed analysis for ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "although tempting , one can not assume that all ( 3 + 1 ) results are equivalent to those from ( 1 + 1 ) calculations .",
    "first , there are new divergences in the ( 3 + 1 ) case to deal with .",
    "second , the structure of the retarded field in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional spacetime is much richer : it consists of a bound field ( generalized coulomb field ) and a radiation field with a variety of multipole structure , while the ( 1 + 1 ) case has only the radiation field in a different form .",
    "third , an earlier work of one of us @xcite showed that there is some constant negative monopole radiation emitted from a detector initially in the ground state and uniformly accelerated in ( 3 + 1)d minkowski space , and claimed that this signal could be an evidence of the unruh effect .",
    "this contradicts the results reported by hr @xcite and others from the ( 1 + 1)d calculations .",
    "we need to clarify this discrepancy and determine the cause of it , by studying the complete process from transient to steady state .",
    "in particular , since radiation only exists under nonequilibrium conditions in the ( 1 + 1 ) case , it is crucial to understand the transient effects in the ( 3 + 1 ) case to gauge our expectation of what could be , against what would be , observed in laboratories .    in conceptual terms",
    ", one is tempted to invoke stationarity and thermality conditions for the description of an uad .",
    "this is indeed a simple and powerful way to understand its physics if the detector undergoes uniform acceleration and interacts with the field all throughout ( e.g. , because of the stationarity of the problem in the rindler proper time it is guaranteed that the total boost energy - operator is conserved ) .",
    "however , this argument is inapplicable for transient epochs during which the physics is quite different ( see , e.g. , the inertial to uniform acceleration motion treated in @xcite ) .",
    "likewise , one can invoke the thermality condition ( i.e. , the thermal radiance experienced by a uad is equivalent to that of an inertial detector in a thermal bath ) to obtain results based on simple reasonings .",
    "but then we note that the thermality condition does not uniquely arise from uniform acceleration conditions .",
    "for example if the motion is rapidly altered @xcite the radiation produced can be approximately thermal .",
    "this thermality in emitted radiation ( e.g. , from sudden injection of atoms into a cavity ) is similar to those encountered in cosmological particle creation @xcite , but has a different physical origin from unruh effect which is similar to particle creation from black holes ( hawking effect ) @xcite ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in terms of methodology , instead of using the more sophisticated influence functional method as in the earlier series of papers on accelerated detectors @xcite and moving charges @xcite",
    ", our work here follows more closely the work of hr who used the heisenberg operator method to calculate the two - point function and the stress - energy tensor of a massless quantum scalar field . in our analysis",
    "based on the ( 3 + 1)d unruh - dewitt detector theory we found the full and exact dynamics of the detector and the field in terms of their heisenberg operator evolution , thus making available the complete quantum and statistical information for this detector - field system , enabling us to address the interplay of thermal radiance in the detector , vacuum polarization cloud around the detector , quantum fluctuations and radiation , and emitted flux of classical radiation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we introduce the unruh - dewitt detector theory .",
    "then in sec.iii we describe the quantum dynamics of the detector - field system in the heisenberg picture , yielding the expectation values of the detector two - point function with respect to the minkowski vacuum and a detector coherent state in sec.iv . with these results",
    "we derive the two - point function of the quantum field and describe what constitutes the  vacuum polarization \" around the detector in sec.v . then in sec.vi we calculate the quantum expectation values of the stress - energy tensor induced by the uniformly accelerated detector .",
    "this allows us to explore the conservation law and derive the quantum radiation formula .",
    "a comparison with the results in ref.@xcite follows in sec.vii .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in sec.viii .",
    "the total action of the detector - field system is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the internal degree of freedom of the detector , assumed to be a harmonic oscillator with mass @xmath4 and a ( bare ) natural frequency @xmath5 : @xmath6.\\ ] ] here @xmath7 is the detector s proper time .",

    "this can be regarded as a simplified version of an atom .    below we will consider the ud detector moving in a prescribed trajectory @xmath14 in a four - dimensional minkowski spacetime with metric @xmath15 diag@xmath16 and line element @xmath17 . by ",
    "prescribed \" we mean the trajectory of the detector is not considered as a dynamical variable , thus we ignore the backreaction effect of the field on the trajectory .",

    "the quantum part of the coincidence limit of two - point functions , namely , the variances of @xmath3 and @xmath9 , are determined by the detector and the field together .    from the exact solutions , we were able to study the complete process from the initial transient to the final steady state . in particular , we can identify the time scales of transient behaviors analytically . when the coupling is turned on ,",
    "the zero - point fluctuations of the free detector dissipates exponentially , then the vacuum fluctuations take over .",
    "the time scales for both processes are the same .",
    "eventually the variance of @xmath3 saturates at a finite value , where the dissipation of the detector is balanced by the input from the vacuum fluctuations of the field . even in the zero - acceleration limit , the variances of @xmath3 and @xmath184 , thus the ground state energy of the interacting detector , shifted from the ones for the free detector .",
    "this fluctuations - induced effect share a similar origin with that of the lamb shift .",
    "the variance of @xmath3 yields an effective squared scalar charge , which induce a positive variance in the scalar field .",
    "this variance of the field contributes a positive radiated energy at the quantum level .",
    "however , the interference between the vacuum fluctuations and the retarded solution induced by the vacuum fluctuations screens part of the emission of quantum radiation .",
    "the time scale of the screening is proportional to @xmath363 for @xmath520 , where @xmath1 is the proper acceleration and @xmath521 is the damping constant proportional to @xmath522 .",
    "after the screening the renormalized green s functions of the field are still non - zero in steady state .    a quantum radiation formula determined at the null infinity of minkowski space has been derived .",
    "we found that even in steady state there exists a positive radiated power of quantum nature emitted by the uniformly accelerated ud detector . for large @xmath1",
    "the radiated power is proportional to @xmath523 , where @xmath498 is the unruh temperature .",
    "this could be interpreted as a hint of the unruh effect .",
    "however , the nearly constant negative flux obtained in ref.@xcite for ( 3 + 1)d case is essentially a transient effect .",
    "only part of the radiation is connected to the internal energy of the detector .",
    "the total energy of the dressed detector and the radiated energy of a monopole radiation from the detector is conserved for every proper time interval after the coupling is turned on .",
    "the external agent which drives the detector s motion has no additional influence on this channel .",
    "since the corresponding monopole radiation of quantum nature ceases in steady state , the hint of the unruh effect in the late - time radiated power is not directly from the energy flux experienced by the detector in unruh effect .",
