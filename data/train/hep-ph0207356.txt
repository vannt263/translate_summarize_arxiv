    "decays @xcite . in the standard model ( sm )",
    "the phenomenon of cp violation originates from the ckm three generation quark mixing matrix @xcite .",
    "it is an impressive success of this ckm picture of cp and flavor violation that the world average of the asymmetry in @xmath5 decays @xcite @xmath8 agrees with the value extracted from experimental constraints from very different processes such as those in the kaon sector , @xmath9 at @xmath10 c.l .",
    "however , this ckm paradigm is now challenged by the recently reported measurements of cp asymmetries in @xmath0 decays by babar @xcite @xmath11 and belle @xcite @xmath12 with resulting error weighted average @xmath13 with errors added in quadrature .",
    "the value in ( [ eq : belle ] ) corresponds to the coefficient of the sine term in the time dependent cp asymmetry , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "belle also quotes a value for the direct cp asymmetry , i.e. ,  the cosine term @xmath14 @xcite , which is consistent with zero . in view of the current large experimental uncertainties ,",
    "we neglect direct cp violating effects on the decay amplitudes in reporting the result of ( [ eq : ave ] ) . with increasing precision they will become sensible and yield additional information @xcite .    in the sm",
    "the above decay modes are related such that the difference @xmath15 of their asymmetries obeys @xcite-@xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 appears in wolfenstein s parameterization of the ckm matrix .",
    "evaluation of ( [ eq : avepsi ] ) , ( [ eq : ave ] ) yields @xmath18 hence violates the sm at 2.7 @xmath1 .",
    "the impact of these experimental results on the validity of ckm and sm is currently statistics limited .",
    "future prospects at the @xmath19-factories are that the statistical error @xmath20 can be expected to improve roughly by a factor of three with an increase of integrated luminosity from @xmath21 to @xmath22 @xcite and it will take some time before we know @xmath15 with sufficient significance to draw final conclusions .    in the following we entertain the possibility of a would - be measurement of @xmath23 or a similar value which departs drastically from the sm expectation of ( [ eq : diff ] ) .",
    "we discuss the generic requirements to new physics ( np ) models to explain these values in section [ sec : weak ] . in section [ sec : new ] we work out and discuss the reach of specific models in the observable @xmath24 and conclude in section [ sec : end ] .",

    "the `` golden - plated '' mode @xmath5 is mediated at the quark level by @xmath38 decay and receives a large contribution from tree level @xmath39 exchange .",
    "hence , we expect @xmath36 to be subleading even in the presence of np . on the other hand",
    ", the rare @xmath40 decay appears in the sm only at the loop level , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sm ] , and therefore is generically more susceptible to ( new ) physics from the weak and higher scales .    measurements of @xmath41 and @xmath42 fix @xmath43 up to a 4-fold ambiguity and in general have 8 pairs @xmath44 as solutions . for example , let s take the good @xmath45 agreement between data on @xmath46 and the sm fit for @xmath47 as an indication that the value of @xmath31 extracted is in the same branch as the one from the sm fit , i.e.  we assume that @xmath38 decays and @xmath32 mixing are dominated by the sm contribution .",
    "( this concerns discrete ambiguities and barring accidental cancellations does not affect our conclusions about large phases in @xmath48 decays . ) then , @xmath49 and @xmath50 using central values .",
    "this requires a large source of cp violation in the @xmath2 amplitude outside of the sm .",
    "we recall that there is no conflict with a small direct cp asymmetry as measured by babar @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "while a large value for @xmath52 would inambiguously indicate the presence of np , a small or vanishing one could be caused by small or vanishing strong phases .",
    "0.0truein    = 1.3 in    -0.3truein    lets illustrate what kind of scales could be invoked for an interpretation of an @xmath53 phase in the @xmath2 decay amplitude .",
    "the measured branching ratio @xmath54 @xcite is in agreement with the sm assuming factorization @xcite , which has however substantial errors from hadronic physics . in the absence of a first principle precision calculation of hadronic 2-body @xmath19",
    "decays into light mesons we will not perform here a detailed study of the @xmath40 matrix element .",
    "instead we assume that @xmath2 decays proceeds via a single flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) operator with appropriate dirac structures @xmath55 @xmath56 generated from an interaction at scale @xmath57 with coupling @xmath58 and @xmath59 contains all flavor mixing information . in the sm , @xmath60 is the weak scale , i.e.  @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 contains the ckm angles .",
    "the operator contributes with wilson coefficient @xmath64 renormalized at the @xmath65 scale of size of a few times @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the np contribution to @xmath67 has to be roughly of comparable size to the sm one to explain the observed @xmath68 branching ratio and has an order one cp phase in the overall mixing coefficient @xmath59 to explain a large cp asymmetry induced by the @xmath2 decay amplitude .",
    "0.0truein    = 1.3 in    -0.3truein    examples of contributions from physics beyond the sm to @xmath2 decays are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bsm ] .",
    "the left diagram displays the effect of a new boson @xmath60 in the fcnc loop with matter @xmath69 in close analogy to the sm mechanism .",
    "if @xmath62 , flavor angles @xmath70 and an @xmath53 cp phase , and @xmath71 is sm - like , then this requires @xmath72 gev to satisfy the conditions on size and cp breaking discussed above . assuming a larger wilson coefficient of order 1 requires @xmath73 tev .",
    "another possibility is tree level fcnc at the weak scale , where @xmath74 , @xmath62 and @xmath75 .",
    "this is illustrated in the right diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : bsm ] .",
    "the @xmath76 coupling has to be dominantly imaginary and satisfy @xmath77 to be in the right ball park .",
    "in this section we examine the reach of different models in the phase of the @xmath2 decay amplitude . in particular we study the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , a variant of the 2 higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) iii which contains an extra source of cp violation and a model with a vector - like down quark ( vldq ) .",
    "the cp reach in @xmath2 is estimated using the effective hamiltonian description and factorization @xcite . while this latter approach contains model dependence it gives the right pattern in which np enters the rare decays .",
    "our findings are summarized in table [ tab : pattern ] .",
    "only those models with @xmath78 are able to reproduce @xmath79 or a value similarly different from @xmath80 .    what is the explanation in supersymmetry ( susy ) ?",
    "to depart significantly from the sm with @xmath81 one has to go beyond the mssm with minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) , i.e.  allow for more cp and flavor violation than the one present in the sm that is in the yukawas .",
    "recall that gauge and anomaly mediation are mfv , whereas in general susy guts @xcite and effective susy models @xcite are not .    allowing for arbitrary mixing in the down squark sector ,",
    "the effect of gluino contributions in @xmath2 decay has been analyzed in refs .",
    "as shown in @xcite , an order one np contribution to the qcd penguins at the weak scale can give at most a 10 @xmath82 contribution at the scale @xmath83 .",
    "imposing experimental constraints from @xmath84 a range @xmath85 has been obtained @xcite .",
    "a most important contribution in a generic mssm without mfv stems from up squark mixing between the second and third generation which flips chirality , parametrized by @xmath86 .",
    "this parameter is essentially unconstrained @xmath87 , can be complex and induces an effective @xmath76 vertex @xmath88 defined as @xcite @xmath89 these @xmath3 penguins are constrained by @xmath90 decays @xmath91 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the contribution to @xmath92 is then @xmath93 . if the penguins are sizeable- indicating the presence of large , complex up squark mixing in the mssm- they access values of @xmath43 of @xmath53 .",
    "the effect of r - parity violating operators @xmath94 is small because there are no tree level contributions to the @xmath2 operator ( [ eq : o ] ) due to the symmetry properties of the super potential @xcite .",
    "we study the 2 hdm iii as an example of a np scenario with an extended higgs sector .",
    "the relevant model parameters are the charged higgs mass and the `` wrong '' higgs couplings of the third generation ( we neglect all entries except the @xmath95 one ) and their relative phase .",
    "this new cp phase enters predominantly the dipole operators such as the one with a gluon @xmath96 , see @xcite for details .",
    "this operator contributes to the @xmath2 amplitude , though in the sm at subleading level compared to the qcd penguins , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the 2hdm iii model is constrained by non - observation of the charged higgs @xmath97 gev , the @xmath84 branching ratio , @xmath32 mixing , the @xmath98 parameter and the neutron electric dipole moment .",
    "we scan over the allowed parameter space and obtain @xmath99 .",
    "a simple model beyond the sm with an enlarged matter sector is the one with an additional vector - like down quark @xmath100 .",
    "the @xmath101 dimensional extended ckm matrix @xmath102 includes mixing between @xmath100 and the sm quark doublets and causes tree level fcnc couplings to the @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "these are given as @xmath103 for @xmath104 transitions , where @xmath105 diagonalizes the down sector .",
    "this gives also the amount of ckm unitarity violation @xmath106 which vanishes in the sm .",
    "following the discussion for the susy models with @xmath3-penguins , we relate @xmath107 and get @xmath108 , slightly better than the bound from @xcite .",
    "the reach of the vldq model in @xmath43 is @xmath53 in agreement with the estimates at the end of section [ sec : weak ] .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have examined the implications of the experimental results @xcite on cp violation from interference between mixing and decay in @xmath109 decays .",
    "these data are in conflict with the sm at @xmath110 _ and _ with many np scenarios without @xmath43 of @xmath53 , as compiled in table [ tab : pattern ] , such as the mssm with mfv .",
    "as we find , models with sizeable and complex @xmath76 couplings do have the required cp reach in @xmath2 decays .",
    "note that anomalous couplings generically lead to large effects in the @xmath76 vertex @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3-penguins contribute also to @xmath90 decays , @xmath111 decays and @xmath112 mixing @xcite .    a new cp violating np contribution to the operator ( [ eq : o ] ) will leak into other decays such as @xmath113 which do have a @xmath114 admixture .",
    "belle reported for the time - dependent asymmetry parameters @xmath115 and @xmath116 @xcite,@xcite . due to",
    "the anomalously large branching ratio of @xmath117 decays @xcite the effect of np in the @xmath118 vertex can be diluted in these channels by an enhanced sm contribution .",
    "hence , it is conceivable that @xmath119 is closer to @xmath120 than @xmath121 in agreement with the data and the hypothesis of sizeable np in @xmath0 decays .",
    "there might be as well already np in the cp asymmetry in @xmath122 decays ( [ eq : avepsi ] ) . excluding the possibility that np in @xmath123 and/or @xmath124 mixing conspires such that the fit @xmath125 lives on a different branch than @xmath31 , this effect is at the 10 percent level . since @xmath126 @xcite and assuming approximate flavor universality an order one np contribution to @xmath0 is roughly a @xmath127 correction to @xmath5 which is within the errors .",
    "sensitivity to np from measuring @xmath125 in different decays is limited by the error on @xmath128 , which can be improved if the error on @xmath129 decreases and the sm background from @xmath130 contributions to @xmath40 which has been suggested to bound by @xmath131 analysis @xcite .",
