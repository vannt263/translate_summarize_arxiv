    "concentration of measure phenomenon was introduced in the seventies by v. milman @xcite in his study of asymptotic geometry of banach spaces .",
    "it was then studied in depth by many authors including gromov @xcite , talagrand @xcite , maurey @xcite , ledoux @xcite , bobkov @xcite and many others and played a decisive role in analysis , probability and statistics in high dimensions .",
    "we refer to the monographs @xcite and @xcite for an overview of the field .",
    "one classical example of such phenomenon can be observed for the standard gaussian measure @xmath0 on @xmath1 it follows from the well known sudakov - tsirelson - borell isoperimetric result in gauss space @xcite that if @xmath2 are @xmath3 i.i.d random vectors with law @xmath0 and @xmath4 is a @xmath5-lipschitz function ( with respect to the euclidean norm ) , then @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and where @xmath9 denotes the median of the random variable @xmath10 .",
    "the remarkable feature of this inequality is that it does not depend on the sample size @xmath3 .",
    "this property was used in numerous applications @xcite .",
    "the standard gaussian measure is far from being the only example of a probability distribution satisfying such a bound . in this introduction",
    ", we will say that a probability @xmath11 on some metric space @xmath12 satisfies the gaussian dimension - free concentration of measure phenomenon if holds true , with a constant @xmath13 independent on @xmath3 , when the @xmath14 s are distributed according to @xmath11 and @xmath15 is a function which is @xmath5-lipschitz with respect to the distance @xmath16 defined on @xmath17 by @xmath18^{1/2},\\qquad x , y \\in x^n.\\ ] ] this is also equivalent to the following property : for all positive integers @xmath3 , and all borel set @xmath19 such that @xmath20 , it holds @xmath21 where @xmath22 .    for instance",
    "if @xmath11 is a probability measure on @xmath23 , or even more generally on a smooth riemannian manifold @xmath24 equipped with its geodesic distance @xmath25 and has a density of the form @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is some smooth function on @xmath24 such that the so - called bakry - mery curvature condition holds @xmath28 for some @xmath29 , then the gaussian dimension - free concentration of measure phenomenon holds with the constant @xmath30 ( a direct proof can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "another very classical sufficient condition for the gaussian concentration of measure property is the logarithmic sobolev inequality introduced by gross @xcite ( see also stam @xcite and federbush @xcite ) . if , for some @xmath31 , @xmath11 satisfies @xmath32 for all smooth functions @xmath33 , then it satisfies with @xmath34 ( a proof of this classical result due to herbst can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "we recall that the entropy functional of a positive function @xmath35 is defined by @xmath36 .",
    "condition - denoted @xmath37 in the sequel - is less restrictive since , according to the famous bakry - mery criterion implies .",
    "it turns out that condition can be further relaxed .",
    "indeed , in @xcite , talagrand introduced another remarkable functional inequality involving the wasserstein distance @xmath38 defined , for all probability mesures @xmath39 on @xmath24 by @xmath40,\\ ] ] where the infimum runs over all pairs of random variables @xmath41 , with @xmath42 distributed according to @xmath11 and @xmath43 according to @xmath44 a probability measure @xmath11 satisfies talagrand s transport inequality @xmath45 for some @xmath46 , if @xmath47 for all probability measure @xmath48 on @xmath24 , where @xmath49 denotes the relative entropy defined by @xmath50 , @xmath51 if @xmath52 ( i.e. , @xmath48 absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath11 ) and @xmath53 otherwise . a nice argument first discovered by marton @xcite shows that is a sufficient condition for the gaussian dimension - free concentration property with @xmath54 .",
    "one crucial ingredient to derive dimension - free concentration from @xmath55 is the tensorization property enjoyed by this inequality ( the same property holds for @xmath56 ) : if @xmath11 satisfies @xmath57 , then for any positive integer @xmath3 , the product measure @xmath58 also satisfies @xmath59 condition is again an improvement upon condition since it was proved by otto and villani @xcite ( see @xcite for an alternative proof and @xcite and the references therein for extensions to more general spaces ) that implies with @xmath60 .",
    "it was then shown by the first author @xcite that condition was not only sufficient but also necessary for gaussian dimension - free concentration . more precisely ,",
    "if holds true with some @xmath13 ( and all @xmath3 ) , then @xmath11 satisfies @xmath61 .",
    "one of the main motivations behind this work , and a few satellite papers by the same authors and y. shu @xcite , is to understand what can replace each term in the chain of implications : @xmath62 in a _",
    "discrete _ setting ( for instance , when the space is a graph , finite or otherwise ) .    while several useful variants of the logarithmic sobolev inequality are well identified in discrete ( involving different natural discrete gradients , see",
    "@xcite ) , the other terms are far from being understood .    after the works by lott - villani @xcite and sturm @xcite extending to non - smooth geodesic spaces through convexity properties of the entropy functional on the space of probability measures equipped with the wasserstein distance @xmath38 , the question of generalizing the bakry - mery condition in a discrete setting attracted in recent years a lot of attention .",
    "we refer to the works by ollivier @xcite , bonciocat - sturm @xcite , ollivier - villani @xcite , erbar - mass @xcite , hillion @xcite and the work @xcite by the authors for different attempts to give a meaning to the notion of `` discrete curvature '' .    in the present paper ,",
    "the focus is put on the rightmost terms of our chain of implications : namely , our purpose is to find out what type of dimension - free concentration results we can hope for in a discrete setting and what type of transport inequalities can be related to it . at this stage , it is worth noting that , unfortunately , talagrand s inequality is _ never _ satisfied in discrete ( except of course by a dirac mass ) .",
    "for instance , it is proven in full generality in @xcite , that if @xmath11 is a probability measure on a metric space @xmath12 which satisfies @xmath55 , then its support is connected .",
    "it follows from the equivalence @xmath63 , that gaussian dimension - free concentration is also never true in discrete .",
    "one thus looks for a transport - cost sufficiently weaker than @xmath64 , to allow discrete measures to satisfy the related transport inequality , but sufficiently strong to make the transport inequality stable under tensor products",
    ". a natural candidate would be the @xmath65 distance : @xmath66 : \\mathrm{law}(x)=\\mu , \\mathrm{law}(y)=\\nu\\}.$ ] although transport inequalities involving @xmath67 instead of @xmath64 ( the so called @xmath68 inequalities ) make perfectly sense in discrete ( see bobkov - gtze @xcite , djelout - guillin - wu @xcite , bobkov - houdr - tetali @xcite ) , these inequalities tensorize only with a constant depending on the dimension !",
    "so the @xmath65 distance does not fulfill the second requirement .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the study of a family of weak transport costs , one typical element of which is the following weak version of the cost @xmath64 defined as follows . if @xmath11 and @xmath48 are probability measures on a metric space @xmath12 , one defines the weak cost @xmath69 as follows @xmath70 ^ 2\\,\\right]\\ ] ] where again the infimum runs over all pairs ( @xmath71 ) of random variables such that @xmath42 follows the law @xmath11 and @xmath43 the law @xmath44 jensen inequality immediately shows that @xmath72 two weak versions of talagrand s inequality are naturally associated to this cost : a probability @xmath11 is said to satisfy @xmath73 for some @xmath31 if @xmath74 and to satisfy @xmath75 if @xmath76 since @xmath77 is not symmetric these two inequalities are not equivalent in general .",
    "both are of course implied by the usual @xmath57 inequality .",
    "as we shall see in theorem  [ gozlan ] , which is one of our main results , a probability measure @xmath11 on @xmath42 satisfies the two inequalities @xmath78 for some @xmath31 if and only if it satisfies the following dimension - free concentration of measure property : for all positive integer @xmath3 and all set @xmath19 such that @xmath79 , it holds @xmath80 for some @xmath81 related to @xmath82 . in this concentration inequality the enlargement @xmath83 of @xmath84 is defined as follows @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the set of all borel probability measures on @xmath87 taking @xmath88 with @xmath89 , we see immediately that @xmath90 and therefore is less demanding than .    before going further into the presentation of our results , let us make some bibliographical comments on these weak transport costs and on the concentration property . first of all , this way of enlarging sets first appeared in the papers @xcite by talagrand , in the particular case where @xmath91 is the hamming distance ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1.1 ) and ( * ? ? ? * ( 1.2 ) ) ) .",
    "it was shown by talagrand that _ any _ probability measure @xmath11 on a polish space @xmath42 satisfies the concentration inequality with some universal constant @xmath81 ( and with the hamming distance ) . this deep result known as talagrand s convex hull concentration inequality has had a lot of interesting applications in probability theory and combinatorics @xcite .",
    "the result was given another proof by marton in @xcite , where she introduced ( again with @xmath25 being the hamming distance ) the weak transport cost @xmath77 ( denoted @xmath92 in her work ) and proved that any probability measure @xmath11 satisfies @xmath93 for all probability measures @xmath94 then she proved the tensorization property for this transport inequality and derived from it , using an argument that will be recalled in section [ sec : concentration ] , talagrand s concentration result .",
    "a similar strategy was then developed by dembo in @xcite in order to recover the sharp form of other concentration results by talagrand involving a control by @xmath95 points . finally the third named author extended in @xcite the tensorization technique of marton to some classes of dependent random variables . in @xcite",
    "he improved marton s transport inequality to recover yet another sharp concentration inequality by talagrand ( discovered in @xcite ) related to deviation inequalities for empirical processes . besides the hamming case",
    ", almost nothing is known on the inequalities @xmath96 .",
    "note that marton s result shows at least that any probability measure on a bounded metric space @xmath12 ( for instance a finite graph equipped with graph distance ) satisfies @xmath97 for @xmath98 , but the optimal constant @xmath82 can be much smaller .",
    "note also that if our primary motivation was to consider these inequalities on discrete spaces , the continuous case is also of interest since the inequalities @xmath96 could be a good substitute for probability measures not satisfying the usual @xmath55 .",
    "the aim of the paper is thus to provide different tools that can be useful in the study of these weak transport cost inequalities and to exhibit some new examples of such inequalities ( mostly on unbounded spaces ) .",
    "the main new tool we introduce is a version of the kantorovich duality theorem suitable for the weak transport cost @xmath77 .",
    "actually this duality result holds for a large family of transport costs that we shall now describe .",
    "to each cost function @xmath99 $ ] , ( where @xmath100 is the set of borel probability measures on @xmath42 ) we associate the optimal transport cost @xmath101 defined , for all probability measures @xmath39 on @xmath42 , by @xmath102 where the infimum runs over the set of all probability kernels @xmath103 such that @xmath104 .",
    "note that the usual cost @xmath64 corresponds to @xmath105 and the weak cost @xmath77 to @xmath106 . under some easily satisfiable technical assumptions on @xmath107 ( an important one being that @xmath107 be _ convex _ with respect to its second variable @xmath108 ) ,",
    "we prove in theorem [ kantorovich general ] that @xmath109 where the supremum runs over the set of bounded continuous functions , and @xmath110 note that , when @xmath111 , then @xmath112 and the result reduces to the classical kantorovich duality for @xmath64 ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . up to our best knowledge ,",
    "this class of cost functionals has not been considered before in the literature on optimal transport but we think that it may find interesting applications in this field .",
    "for example , denoting by @xmath113 the weak cost associated to the cost function @xmath114 defined on @xmath115 where @xmath116 is some norm on @xmath23 , it turns out that the duality formula for @xmath117 immediately gives back a well known result by strassen @xcite about the existence of martingales with given marginals .",
    "this is detailed in section [ sec : strassen ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 introduces a general definition of optimal transport costs and presents in detail three particular families of costs ( all variants of marton s costs @xmath77 defined above ) which will play a role in the rest of the paper .",
    "in particular , we state a kantorovich duality formula for each of these transport costs .",
    "section 3 is dedicated to the proof of strassen s theorem on the existence of martingales with given marginals .",
    "section 4 introduces the general definition of transport - entropy inequalities ( involving general transport costs of the form ) and presents their basic properties such as their dual formulation and their tensorization .",
    "section 5 deals with the links between concentration of measure and transport - entropy inequalities .",
    "we recall in particular the argument due to marton that enables to deduce concentration estimates from transport - entropy inequalities .",
    "we also extend to this general framework a result by the first author and show that in great generality dimension - free concentration gives back transport - entropy inequalities . in particular , we give a characterization ( in terms of a transport - entropy inequality involving the cost @xmath118 defined above ) of dimension - free gaussian concentration restricted to lipschitz convex ( or concave ) functions .",
    "in section 6 we recall the universal transport - entropy inequalities developed by marton @xcite , dembo @xcite and samson @xcite in order to recover some of talagrand s concentration inequalities for product measures .",
    "we take advantage of our duality theorems to revisit and bring some simplifications in the proof of @xcite .    in section 7",
    "we present the examples of bernoulli , binomial and poisson laws for which some sharp transport - entropy are proved in @xcite .    in section 8",
    "we show the equivalence between transport - entropy inequalities involving the transport cost @xmath118 and the logarithmic - sobolev inequality restricted to the class of log - convex or log - concave functions .",
    "this enables us to get other examples for these transport inequalities .",
    "finally , section 9 contains the proof of our general kantorovich duality result , theorem  [ kantorovich general ] , for a transport cost of the form .",
    "in this section , we introduce a general class of optimal transport costs and describe an associated kantorovich type duality formula .      throughout the paper @xmath12",
