    "nowadays it is widely accepted , that it is not possible to single out the only , unique measure in the set @xmath1 of all density matrices of size @xmath0 .    however , several possible measures are distinguished by different mathematical and physical arguments .",
    "for instance the hilbert - schmidt ( hs ) measure arises if one constructs random pure states @xmath2 distributed according to the natural ( fubini  study ) measure on the space of pure states on a composite hilbert space @xmath3 and obtains mixed states by partial tracing , @xmath4 @xcite .",

    "for instance , the set of @xmath6 mixed states analyzed with respect to the hs distance displays the geometry of the @xmath7ball ( the bloch ball ) , with the bloch sphere , containing the pure states , at its boundary .",
    "another measure in the space of mixed states , which should be distinguished , is the bures measure @xcite .",

    "it is a fisher  adjusted metric @xcite , since in the subspace of diagonal matrices it induces the statistical distance @xcite .",
    "moreover , the bures metric is fubini  study adjusted , since at the space of pure states both metrics do agree @xcite",
    ". these unique features of the bures distance are used to support the claim that without any prior knowledge on a certain density matrix , the optimal way to mimic it is to generate it at random with respect to the bures measure .    in this work",
    "we analyze statistical properties of ensembles of random states . in section",
    "ii we provide the definitions of the hilbert  schmidt and the bures ensembles of random density matrices and recall their joint distribution functions for their spectra .",

    "section v is devoted to the ensembles of random matrices obtained by partial tracing , for which the average traces and the eigenvalue correlation functions are computed .",
    "we are concerned with ensembles of random states , for which the probability measure has a product form and may be factorized @xcite , @xmath10 the latter factor , d@xmath11 , determining the distribution of the eigenvectors of the density matrix , is the unique , unitarily invariant , haar measure on @xmath12 . on the other hand , the first factor describing the distribution of eigenvalues",

    "such induced measures were discussed many times in the literature @xcite , while the normalisation constant was derived in @xcite .",
    "note that in the symmetric case @xmath23 the induced measure reduces to the hilbert - schmidt measure ( [ hsmes ] ) .",
    "it is worth to emphasize a link to known ensembles of random matrices . in order to construct a random density matrix according to the measure @xmath24 it is sufficient to generate a rectangular gaussian matrix @xmath25 of size @xmath26 and to compute @xmath27 @xcite . in the special case @xmath23",
    "this fact shows a relation between the ginibre ensemble of non hermitian random matrices @xcite and the hilbert - schmidt measure .",
    "the bures measure in the simplex of eigenvalues may be derived from an assumption that any ball in the sense of the bures distance of a fixed radius belonging to the set @xmath1 has the same volume .",

    "to characterize , to what extend a given state @xmath14 is mixed one may use the moments , tr@xmath31 , with any @xmath32 .",
    "the simplest to compute is the second trace @xmath33 , called _ purity _ , which is closely related to the _ linear entropy _ @xmath34 and inverse participation ratio , @xmath35 .",
    "mean purity averaged over the hs measure is smaller then the average over the bures measure , @xmath36 this result reflects the fact that the bures measure is more concentrated on the states of higher purity , than the hilbert - schmidt measure @xcite .",
