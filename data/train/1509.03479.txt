    "in ref .  , a quantum kinetic density matrix approach for the spin dynamics in mn doped semiconductors was developed starting from the hamiltonian : @xmath3 where @xmath4 describes the single particle band energies , @xmath5 accounts for the exchange interaction between the @xmath6-type conduction band electrons and the spins of the @xmath7-type electrons of the mn dopands while @xmath8 stands for the interaction of the latter with @xmath9-type holes .",
    "finally , @xmath10 comprises the dipole coupling to an external laser field .",
    "the exchange interactions @xmath11 as well as the random spatial distribution of mn atoms give rise to a hierarchy of higher order correlation functions . in order to obtain a finite set of dynamical variables",
    "a specially adapted correlation expansion has been worked out in ref .  .",
    "since the aim of the present paper is to investigate the spin transfer between conduction band electrons and mn dopands , the model can be reduced to : @xmath12 @xmath4 now accounts only for electrons in a single spin degenerate conduction band : @xmath13 where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) are the creation ( annihilation ) operators of conduction band electrons with k - vektor @xmath16 and spin index @xmath17 . for simplicity",
    "we shall assume parabolic bands @xmath18 , with an effective mass @xmath19 .",
    "the exchange interaction is given by @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the exchange constant and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) are operators for the spin of the mn atom ( conduction band electron ) in units of @xmath24 at the position @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "as in ref .",
    "we assume an on average spatially homogeneous distribution of mn positions @xmath25 .    according to the analysis in ref .",

    "this is a situation typical for a system , immediately after an ultrafast optical excitation has induced a finite electron spin polarization .",

    "( [ eq : eomq ] ) , we follow the procedure that in ref .",

    "( [ eq : eomq ] ) that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are of second order in @xmath1 and yield third order contributions to the electron spin dynamics .",

    "this allows us to formally integrate the correlations : @xmath45 with frequency @xmath46 . substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : integralgl ] ) back into the equations for @xmath30 and @xmath31 we have to perform a @xmath47-summation which due to interference resulting from the @xmath47-dependent phases @xmath48 leads to a finite memory .",
    "the markov limit is established by assuming that the sources @xmath44 change on a much slower timescale than the memory and can therefore be drawn out of the integral . the memory has been found to decay on a fs - timescale while the spin dynamics evolves on a ps - timescale @xcite .",

    "the first term describes the precession of the electron spin in an effective magnetic field due to the mn magnetization @xmath2 , which is also the result of a mean - field calculation@xcite .",
    "the second term represents a renormalization of the precession frequency that depends on the density of states and therefore on the dimensionality of the system as well as the k - vektor , which can possibly lead to dephasing of the electron spin . +",
    "the magnitude of the renormalization for a bulk semiconductor can be estimated in the continuum limit by approximating the brillouin zone ( bz ) as a sphere with radius @xmath57 and assuming a parabolic band structure as follows : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the mean - field precession frequency .",
    "the order of magnitude of the integral on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : renorm3d ] ) can be determined by noting that the optically excited carriers occupy only very few states near the center of the bz and therefore for the most part of the bz @xmath60 holds which also implies @xmath61 for the occupied states .",
    "approximating @xmath60 and @xmath62 the integral yields the value @xmath57 . for the parameters used in our study ( see below ) the renormalization is estimated in this way to be of the order of @xmath63 of the mean - field precession frequency .",
    "this fact supports the findings of refs .   that the markov limit is not a good approximation in systems with dimensions lower than 3 . ] .",
    "+ the third term in eq .  (",
    "[ eq : markov ] ) , which is proportional to the mn spin , describes a transfer of spin from the mn to the electron system .",
    "the prefactor @xmath64 is zero for @xmath65 . for @xmath66",
    "no transfer can occur because there are no electrons that can exchange their spins with the mn atoms ; for @xmath67 the transfer vanishes due to pauli blocking .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath68 has the form of the relaxation term of a landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation and describes the tendency of a spin in a given effective magnetic field to align along the direction of the field . unlike in the llg equation , here , the prefactor is determined by the parameters of the microscopic model and is not a phenomenological fitting parameter .    the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : markov ] ) resembles a relaxation term that would be expected in the llg equation for the mn magnetization @xmath69 . here",
    ", it arises in the equation for the electron spin reflecting the conservation of total spin which is a feature also of the full qkt @xcite",
    ". however , there is a crucial difference between the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : markov ] ) and the llg relaxation term for the mn magnetization : while the cross - products in the llg equation involve classical vectors , we are dealing here with vector operators . here",
    ", the expectation value has to be taken after constructing the cross product in a symmetrized form .",
    "the physical consequences of this difference become most obvious by rewriting the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : markov ] ) as follows : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 describe the electron spin of the states with k - vector @xmath16 in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the mn spin vector @xmath69 and @xmath73 .",
    "it is seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : damping ] ) that even when the electron spin is aligned parallel to the mn spin , a spin transfer can occur , and it was already noted in ref .   that the corresponding parallel spin transfer rate coincides with the result of fermi s golden rule .",
    "in contrast , the corresponding term in the standard llg equation would be zero .",
    "this transfer is enabled because the factor @xmath74 is non - zero as quantum mechanically the maximal value of @xmath75 is @xmath76 , while @xmath77 which reflects the uncertainty between the respective spin components . for classical vectors ,",
    "as considered in the standard llg equation , this factor would always be zero .",
    "furthermore , in general the contribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : damping ] ) is different for the parallel and perpendicular components of the electron spin .",
    "it is noteworthy that if the mn spin had been represented by a pseudo - spin @xmath78 , this feature would be lost as then independent of the mn spin configuration we find @xmath79 and @xmath80 resulting in the same prefactors for @xmath81 and @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : damping ] ) .",
    "in order to use eq .",
    "( [ eq : markov ] ) in practical calculations we have to know the values of the average mn spin @xmath2 and according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : damping ] ) the second moment @xmath83 which appear on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : markov ] ) .",
    "the average mn spin can be calculated from the knowledge of the electron spin and the initial total spin by using the total spin conservation@xcite .",
    "setting up an equation of motion for the second moment is cumbersome and not necessary for the cases that we shall discuss in this paper where it is assumed that the number of mn ions by far exceeds the number of photo induced electrons ( @xmath84 ) . in this case , the change of the average mn spin as well as its second moment can be neglected and thus the second moment essentially coincides with its initial thermal value .",
    "furthermore , for nearly constant mn magnetization , the equations of motion for electron states with different energies @xmath85 are decoupled in the markov limit due to the delta - distribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : markov ] ) and the fact that @xmath86 remains constant which allows using the initial occupation for the evaluation of the frequency renormalization .",
    "the decoupling of the equations of motion in the markov limit enables us to find analytical solutions for eq .",
    "( [ eq : markov ] ) . to this end",
    "we split the electron spin into its components parallel and perpendicular to the mn spin according to : @xmath87 where @xmath88 accounts for the precession of the perpendicular component that results from eq .",

    "reinserting the solutions for @xmath93 and @xmath94 into eq .",
    "( [ eq : e - spin ] ) and choosing again @xmath95 as the unit of time , we conclude that for given initial conditions the time trace of the electron spin @xmath96 is affected by the material parameters only via the ratio @xmath97 .",
    "the quantum kinetic equations of motion ( [ eq : eomq ] ) have been solved numerically and compared with their markov limit ( [ eq : markov ] ) for different initial conditions in a three dimensional bulk dms .",
    "the initial electron distribution over the single particle energies @xmath98 is taken to be gaussian with its center at @xmath99 and a standard deviation of @xmath100 while the initial magnitude of the mn spin is set to @xmath101 ( i.e. , @xmath102 of its maximal value ) .",
    "the material parameters used were the same as in ref .   for zn@xmath103mn@xmath104se with @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "first , we shall discuss results where at the beginning of the simulation the electron spins are assumed to be totally polarized in a direction with an angle of @xmath107 with respect to the mn magnetization vector . displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] is the corresponding time evolution of the electron spin ; part ( a ) shows the total electron spin , while in parts ( b ) and ( c ) the components parallel and perpendicular to the mn magnetization are plotted , respectively .",
    "the full quantum kinetic results are plotted as solid red lines whereas curves derived from the analytical solutions of the markov limit equations are depicted as dashed green lines .    as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] ( a ) , the dynamics predicted by the full theory is qualitatively different from the markovian result . on a short time",
    "scale ( for our parameters @xmath108 ps ) , the electron spin decays much faster for the full solution than in the markov limit .",
    "subsequently , the quantum kinetic curve exhibits a non - monotonic time dependence and the electron spin eventually approaches a finite value .",
    "in contrast , in the markov limit , we find a monotonic , almost exponential decay for all times . from the explicit analytical expression ( cf .",
    "appendix  [ ap : riccati ] ) it is seen that the long time limit of the electron spin in the markov limit is zero .",
    "the origin of the non - monotonic behavior can be understood by splitting the total electron spin into its components parallel [ fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] ( b ) ] and perpendicular [ fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] ( c ) ] to the mn spin .",
    "both spin components decrease almost exponentially in the ml as well as in the full qkt .",
    "the time evolution of the perpendicular spin component essentially yields the same results for the full quantum kinetic calculation and the markov limit . in the full qkt",
    ", however , the parallel spin component changes its sign and converges to a finite negative value , whereas both spin components in the ml and the perpendicular spin component of the qkt drop to zero .",
    "when the parallel spin component in the full qkt crosses the zero line , its modulus has a minimum which leads to a minimum in the total spin .",
    "the obvious discrepancy between the different levels of theory with regard to the dynamics of the parallel spin component does not arise due to the assumption of a short memory in the ml .",
    "this can be seen from calculations , where only the source terms @xmath44 , i.e. , the terms used to derive the ml in the first place , have been taken into account but the finite memory expressed by the retardations in eq .",
    "[ eq : integralgl ] are still kept [ blue circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] ] .",
    "the resulting curves almost coincide with the markovian calculation .",
    "the main difference between the full qkt and the ml is due to the source term @xmath109 , which is demonstrated by simulations that incorporate only @xmath110 and @xmath109 [ purple squares in fig .",

    "it should be noted , that especially the term @xmath109 , like @xmath111 and @xmath43 , gives contributions to the reduced electron density matrices in the order of @xmath112 while the leading order contributions of the correlations are of @xmath113 .",
    "thus , our results imply that a proper description of the coupled electron and mn spin dynamics requires a treatment beyond perturbation theory .    .",
    "]    the effect of these higher order contributions on the dynamics is particularly dramatic in the case of initially unpolarized electron spins .",
    "corresponding results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : s0 ] . here ,",
    "even the sign of the spin polarization is opposite for the qkt and ml calculations .",
    "furthermore , also the predictions concerning the magnitude of the spin polarization deviate significantly .",
    "by the numerical analysis in the last section , we were able to trace back the difference between the full quantum kinetic theory and its markov limit to a few selected source terms for the correlations in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eomq ] ) . in this section",
    ", we shall give a physical interpretation to the individual source terms which will enable us to understand what determines their relative importance .",
    "first of all , @xmath110 is the most important source term , because it starts the correlation dynamics , i.e. , without these sources the correlations would stay zero for all times . in the markov limit , @xmath110 yields a landau - lifshitz - gilbert - like damping term described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : damping ] ) and a spin transfer term proportional to the mn spin @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath114 provides corrections for pauli blocking to the transfer term and yields another llg - like damping term , where the electron spin appears twice in the double cross product ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : markov ] ) ) .",
    "as seen above , the quantum kinetic @xmath44 contributions act similarly to their markov limit counterparts .",
    "the dominant role of these terms is further emphasized by the fact that they are the leading terms in a perturbative treatment with respect to the exchange coupling constant @xmath1 .    in order to understand the meaning of the @xmath42 terms",
    ", it is instructive to reformulate the equations of motion of the qkt by introducing new correlation functions according to : @xmath115 which are summed over the electron band and mn state indices . here",
    ", we use the conventions @xmath116 with @xmath117 and @xmath118 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eomddtq ] ) , we obtain the following equations of motion for the summed correlations :    @xmath119    [ eq : corr_geom ]    where    @xmath120\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath121 is the levi - civita symbol .",
    "we note in passing that the residual sources @xmath122 contain a term resulting from @xmath123 which can not be expressed by the summed correlations .",
    "thus , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : corr_geom ] ) are numerically advantageous only if @xmath123 is disregarded .",
    "the point here is that the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr_geom_c ] ) originating from @xmath109 and @xmath111 both involve the levi - civita symbol and can therefore be interpreted as describing precessions .",
    "this can be made more explicit , e.g. , by introducing a vector with components @xmath124 according to @xmath125 then , the first of these terms , which stems from @xmath109 , can be written as a cross product : @xmath126 indicating a precession of the vector @xmath127 around the direction @xmath128 of the mn magnetization with the same frequency as the mean field precession of the electron spin . likewise , the term originating from @xmath111 has a similar structure .",
    "it can also be written as a cross product @xmath129 where now the index @xmath130 is associated with the components of a vector @xmath131 formed from the correlations according to @xmath132 i.e. , now we are dealing with a precession around the direction @xmath133 of the electron spin . thus ,",
    "not only the average spins of the electrons and mn atoms exhibit a precession dynamics , but also their correlations , which is represented in the equations of motion by the @xmath42 terms .",
    "finally , the physical meaning of the @xmath43 source terms becomes clear by noting that their structure is analogous to the structure of the @xmath44 terms , where the products of electron and mn density matrices are replaced by the corresponding unfactorized correlation functions .",
    "thus , the @xmath43 sources provide the correlated parts of the @xmath44 sources which represented a landau - lifshitz - gilbert - like dynamics including pauli blocking .",
    "now that all source terms have been physically interpreted , let us come back to the question of their relative importance in the case considered numerically in subsection [ numerics ] .",
    "as already noted , the sources @xmath44 always play a pivotal role , since no correlations would build up without these terms .",
    "the importance of the remaining terms depends on the physical situation .",
    "looking at the definition eq .",
    "( [ eq : eomq]d - f ) of the sources , it is seen that the terms @xmath134 , with @xmath135 , comprise similar factors as the corresponding contributions @xmath136 , except that the former contain an additional factor proportional to the electron density matrix @xmath30 . from this observation",
    "we can conclude that the @xmath134 sources should be less important than the @xmath136 terms , if the electron density is moderate , as it is the case here .",
    "a criterion for being in the low density limit is particularly easy to formulate for the @xmath42 terms , since eq .",
    "( [ eq : eomq]e ) implies that @xmath111 is negligible compared with @xmath109 if @xmath137 which is fulfilled in our simulations .",
    "however , it is more challenging to give a condition for the negligibility of the @xmath114 term , as it strongly depends on the electron distribution in k - space .    finally , since the @xmath43 sources have the same structure as the @xmath138 term , except that the correlations @xmath40 take the place of the product @xmath139 , they will be of minor importance if the relation @xmath140 is satisfied .",
    "the latter relation is expected to hold , when the conditions for the applicability of the correlation expansion are fulfilled .",
    "the numerical results shown in fig .  [ fig : comp ] indicate that the @xmath43 terms provide insignificant quantitative corrections which confirms the consistency of the correlation expansion approach .",
    "the fact that a source contains correlations is , however , not sufficient for concluding that it can be neglected compared with the @xmath44 terms , which do not involve correlations . in particular , the @xmath109 term was shown to qualitatively modify the spin dynamics ( cf . figs .",
    "[ fig : comp ] and [ fig : s0 ] ) . in view of our interpretation of the @xmath109 term",
    ", this implies physically that accounting for the precession of the correlations around the mn magnetization is essential for a correct description of the spin dynamics .",
    "this also explains why previous studies in refs .   and reported a negligible contribution from the @xmath109 term , since there a situation was considered , where the average mn spin was initially set to zero which suppresses the precession .",
    "the features of the spin dynamics predicted in this article manifest themselves in the time evolution of the spin polarization which is a quantity accessible experimentally , e.g. , by time- and polarization - resolved photoluminescence or faraday-/kerr - rotation measurements@xcite .",
    "favorable for the observation of such effects should be experiments measuring the time dependence of the spin polarization as well as the its equilibrium value where the angle between the mn magnetization and the initial electron spin polarization induced by a circularly polarized laser beam is varied .",
    "for our purposes , bulk materials are preferable compared with , e.g. quantum wells , since for heterostructures , the anisotropy with respect to growth axis as well as structure inversion asymmetry can play a role@xcite which would make it hard to separate the angular dependence predicted by our theory from anisotropy effects . furthermore , ii - vi dms should be better suited for the proposed experiment than iii - v dms , since they have the advantage of isoelectrical doping . in iii - v materials ,",
    "the bir - aronov - pikus interaction@xcite between electron and hole spins can dominate the spin dynamics@xcite , while for ii - vi dms with sufficiently high mn doping the s - d - exchange interaction is typically the most important spin relaxation mechanism@xcite .",
    "in this article , we have analyzed the spin dynamics of conduction band electrons in mn doped bulk dms induced by the s - d - exchange interaction . in contrast to our previous studies @xcite , we now assume a non - zero mn magnetization .",
    "this naturally leads to a distinction between the electron spin dynamics of the components parallel and perpendicular to the mn spin which introduces an anisotropy in the spin relaxation . starting from a microscopic quantum kinetic theory based on correlation expansion",
    "we have derived the markov limit yielding equations similar to the widely used phenomenological landau - lifshitz - gilbert equations .",
    "our derivation yields microscopic expressions for the parameters in the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equations and allows us to identify some quantum corrections .",
    "the resulting rate equations were solved analytically .",
    "numerical simulations within the quantum kinetic theory revealed that , while the dynamics of the perpendicular electron spin component can be well described by the markovian theory , the parallel component exhibits qualitative deviations between the full quantum kinetic and the corresponding markovian results .",
    "the differences between both levels of theory manifest themselves in a non - monotonic temporal behavior of the total spin in the quantum kinetic theory as opposed to an almost exponential monotonic decay predicted by the markovian theory .",
    "moreover , for certain excitation conditions , even the sign of the spin polarization differs between these levels of theory .",
    "a detailed analysis allowed us to assign a physical interpretation to all source terms for the correlations and to understand their relative importance found in our numerical studies . with the help of this analysis and our numerical results ,",
    "the deviations between the full quantum kinetic theory and its markov limit were traced back to the neglect of a precession dynamics of the correlations in the markov theory .",
    "this precession is missing in the markov limit not because of the assumption of a short memory but due to the perturbative treatment that is implicit in this approach .",

    "<S> we investigate the transfer between carrier and mn spins due to the s - d - exchange interaction in a mn doped bulk semiconductor within a microscopic quantum kinetic theory . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the spin transfer dynamics is qualitatively different for components of the carrier spin parallel and perpendicular to the mn magnetization . from our quantum kinetic equations </S>",
    "<S> we have worked out the corresponding markov limit which is equivalent to rate equations based on fermi s golden rule . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting equations resemble the widely used landau - lifshitz - gilbert - equations , but also describe genuine spin transfer due to quantum corrections . </S>",
    "<S> although it is known that the markovian rate description works well for bulk systems when the initial mn magnetization is zero , we find large qualitative deviations from the full quantum kinetic theory for finite initial mn magnetizations . </S>",
    "<S> these deviations mainly reflect corrections of higher than leading order in the interaction which are not accounted for in golden rule - type rates .    </S>",
    "<S> diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) have been studied intensively in the past decades , since they combine the versatility of semiconductors with the spin degree of freedom , which promises future applications in spintronics@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic properties of dms arise from the s / p - d exchange interaction@xcite between carriers and magnetic impurities , which typically consist of mn ions acting as localized spin @xmath0 systems . especially for short timescales and high mn doping concentrations </S>",
    "<S> the exchange interaction can dominate the spin dynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the description of the resulting spin transfer dynamics in dms is usually based on rate equations , where the rates are computed using fermi s golden rule@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the standard derivation of the golden rule involves a markov approximation@xcite and is perturbative with respect to the exchange coupling constant . in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> a projection operator method was applied to derive spin relaxation rates for dms quantum wells . there , </S>",
    "<S> also a markovian assumption as well as a perturbative argument were used . </S>",
    "<S> another approach to the description of the macroscopic magnetization dynamics is the use of the phenomenological landau - lifshitz - gilbert equations@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , starting from a kondo - like interaction hamiltonian a density matrix approach based on correlation expansion was developed@xcite in order to describe the spin dynamics in the ultrafast regime . </S>",
    "<S> until now , this quantum kinetic theory ( qkt ) has only been applied to the case of an initially zero mn spin . there </S>",
    "<S> , it has been found that in three dimensional systems , the time evolution of the carrier spin is exponentially decreasing , where the decay rate coincides with its value according to fermi s golden rule@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter was shown by performing the markov limit ( ml ) of the qkt using only terms in second order of @xmath1 . in lower dimensional systems , </S>",
    "<S> excitation conditions can be found , where significant differences between the ml and the qkt become visible although the memory induced by the exchange interaction is orders of magnitude shorter than the timescale for the evolution of the carrier and mn dynamics @xcite . in particular , quantum kinetic effects are most pronounced when suitably tuned oppositely circular </S>",
    "<S> polarized two - color laser pulses are used for the excitation@xcite .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we study the spin dynamics of conduction band electrons in a bulk znmnse semiconductor for the case of a non - zero initial mn spin where electron spins can precess around the mn magnetization . </S>",

    "<S> assuming mn concentrations much larger than the itinerant electron density analytical solutions of these markovian equations are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting analytical expressions also exhibit a different dynamics for perpendicular and parallel spin transfer , which , however , quantitatively and qualitatively disagrees with the prediction of the full qkt . here , the failure of the markovian approach can be traced back to contributions of higher than leading order in the exchange coupling constant .    </S>",
    "<S> outline of the paper : in a first step , we briefly summarize the qkt @xcite that was used as a basis for our numerical calculation and introduce the model used in this paper . then , we derive the markov limit of the qkt along the lines described in ref .   for an initially zero mn magnetization @xmath2 , but allow for a finite value of @xmath2 and an arbitrary angle between the conduction band electron spin and the mn spin . </S>",
    "<S> in a subsequent section we present numerical results of our qkt for the spin transfer dynamics of the parallel and perpendicular components and compare them with the ml . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical solution of the ml equations in combination with a rearrangement of the contributions to our qkt allows for a clear physical interpretation of the pertinent source terms . by selectively studying the impact of different source terms we are able to demonstrate the importance of contributions of higher than leading order in the coupling constant </S>"
