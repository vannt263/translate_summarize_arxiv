    "the dalitz - plot distribution of the @xmath5 process was analyzed by the babar collaboration @xcite .",
    "the resonant dominance sub - structure of this cabibbo suppressed decay was then studied and indicated that an isospin - zero final state may exist @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the dalitz - plot behavior showed the typical structure of a @xmath6 final state with @xmath7 @xcite , which is exotic and can not be composed of a quark - antiquark pair in the conventional quark model @xcite .",
    "if such a resonance exists near @xmath8 mev , it might be a hybrid or four - quark state @xcite .",
    "a hybrid meson is composed of a quark - antiquark pair and an excited gluonic field .",
    "it provides a good platform to search for exotic quantum numbers that can not be realized for a @xmath9 state .",
    "the mass of a @xmath10 hybrid was predicted to be about 1.82.2 gev in the constituent gluon model @xcite , around @xmath11 gev in the qcd coulomb gauge approach @xcite and 2.83.3 gev in qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "these values and ranges are all higher than or marginally consistent with the mass of @xmath4 meson . in the mit bag model @xcite , the hybrid states in the lightest supermultiplet with quantum numbers @xmath12 consist of a s - wave color - octet quark - antiquark pair coupled to an excited gluonic field with @xmath13 .",
    "a higher supermultiplet contains hybrids with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , which were composed of a p - wave @xmath9 pair and the same gluonic excitation @xcite .",
    "the hybrid state with @xmath0 may lie higher than other channels and couple to a different gluonic excitation .",
    "such supermultiplet structures were confirmed in lattice qcd @xcite , qcd sum rules @xcite and the p - wave quasigluon approach @xcite .    in quantum field theory , a hybrid @xmath19 operator and a four - quark operator can transform into each other with the same quantum numbers via quark annihilation interactions ( @xmath20 ) in the @xmath21 channel .",
    "they tend to mix and couple to the same physical state .",
    "in general , there are two types of four - quark operators : tetraquark - like operators @xmath22 and molecule - like operators @xmath23 .",
    "they are related to each other by the fierz transformation and color rearrangement @xcite .",
    "the tetraquark formalism was first suggested in the bag model by jaffe @xcite , then it was extensively investigated and used to study the nature of exotic hadron states @xcite . in the qcd coulomb gauge approach ,",
    "the masses of the @xmath10 molecules and tetraquarks were predicted to be around 1.36 gev and 2.15 gev respectively in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the four - quark states with @xmath0 were also systematically studied in the approach of qcd sum rules using the scalar interpolating currents in ref .",
    "@xcite , which seems not to support a mass below 2 gev .",
    "however , because the coefficient of the four - quark condensate is zero @xcite , it is difficult to assess the uncertainties associated with truncation of the ope .",
    "therefore it is worth considering different interpolating currents in the sum rule analysis , which provide a chance to obtain ope series that have better behaviours . in this work , we shall use the vector currents which can couple to @xmath0 and @xmath1 four - quark states .",
    "we shall perform the numerical analyses of the mass for both the scalar and vector channels . in order to make robust estimates",
    ", we shall use laplace sum rules ( lsr ) and finite energy sum rules ( fesr ) , and use the standard stability criterion with respect to the borel parameter @xmath24 and the continuum threshold @xmath25 to extract the masses .",
    "we shall conclude the paper by discussing the possible explanation of the @xmath3 dominance in @xmath4 decay and the decay patterns of the @xmath10 four - quark states .",
    "introduced by svz in 1979 @xcite , qcd sum rules has become a powerful method to study the hadronic properties .",
    "the basic idea of this approach is to relate the qcd expression of the correlation function ( obtained using the well - known operator product expansion ) with the phenomenological parametrization by using the standard dispersion relation .",
    "the two - point correlation function of the vector current has the following lorentz structure : _ ( q^2 ) & = & id^4xe^iqx0|t|0[eq:1 ] + & = & ( q_q_-q^2g_)_v(q^2)+q_q__s(q^2 ) , where @xmath26 in this work can be the four - quark currents that couple to both the @xmath1 and @xmath10 states , and the invariants @xmath27 and @xmath28 correspond respectively to contributions from the @xmath1 and @xmath10 states .",
    "the correlation function obeys the dispersion relation , which relates the @xmath29 with its imaginary part @xmath30 . for hadrons with light flavour quarks ,",
    "the dispersion relation reads : @xmath31    the dispersion relation provides an important connection between qcd and phenomenology as on the theoretical side the correlator can be expanded in terms of qcd vacuum condensates for large euclidean momentum ( i.e. @xmath32 is much greater than the qcd scale @xmath33 ) while on the phenomenological side the spectral function at low energy can be measured and parameterized experimentally . in this work , we adopt the widely used  one single narrow resonance minimal duality ansatz \" ( which has been tested in @xmath34 and charmonium data @xcite ) to parametrize the spectral function as : _",
    "v / s(s)&&_n(s - m_n^2)0||nn|^+|0 + & & f_h^2(s - m_h^2)+ ( s - s_0 ) , [ res_model ] where @xmath35 and @xmath25 respectively denote the the coupling of the current to the hadron and the qcd continuum threshold .    on the qcd side , the correlation function can be calculated perturbatively using the operator product expansion : _ v / s(q^2 ) _",
    "d=0,2,4 , ... _ dim o = d c(q^2 )  0|o|0  , where @xmath36 are the qcd vacuum condensates of dimension @xmath37 , @xmath38 are the corresponding wilson coefficients calculated in the perturbation theory . for the large euclidian @xmath39 ,",
    "the ope reaches good convergence thus the first few terms ( up to condensate dimension 8 in this work ) are expected to be a good approximation of the correlation function .",
    "to further improve the convergence of ope and also to suppress the continuum contribution in the spectral integral , one can apply the inverse laplace operator to both sides of the dispersion relation and then the moment and the ratio of laplace / borel sum rules ( lsr ) can be derived : [ usr ] m_v / s(,s_0 ) & = & _ 0^s_0 ds  ( -s )   _ v / s(s )  , + r_v / s(,s_0 ) & = & - m_h^2  .    due to the uncertainties induced by the truncation of the ope series and the simple parametrization of the spectral function , the output results depend on the two external parameters @xmath40 .",
    "svz originally suggested the sum rule should be analyzed within a certain range of the borel parameter @xmath24 , which ensures both the validity of the ope truncation and the suppression of the continuum contribution to the spectral integral .",
    "furthermore , some attempts to determine @xmath40 objectively from the sum rules have also been made following either the standard stability criterion with respect to @xmath40 @xcite or the original concept of the sum rule window @xcite ( e.g. , the monte - carlo based weighted - least - squared matching procedure @xcite ) .",
    "one would expect to optimize the output results by demanding that they are insensitive to the variation of @xmath40 .",
    "however , as is well - known , lsr for multi - quark currents ( of high dimension ) is more likely than those for ordinary @xmath41 measons to suffer from eq .  , the simple parametrization of the spectral function , which could lead to the absence of the @xmath25-stability .",
    "such cases have occurred in tetraquark and pentaquark sum rules , as has been discussed in @xcite .    in the case where the @xmath25-stability is not reached , fesr has been shown in some other sum rule analyses for multi - quark states @xcite to be a useful complement .",
    "the moment and ratio of fesr read : [ fesr ] r_v / s(s_0 ) & = & _ 0^s_0 ds  s   _ v / s(s)_0^s_0 ds   _ v / s(s ) m_h^2  , which provides a connection between the lowest state mass and the continuum threshold .",
    "fesr can be obtained by letting the borel parameter @xmath24 be zero in lsr prior to renormalization - group improvement , thus it s quite natural to expect such an approach can help reduce the effects of high dimensional condensates in the sum rules and provide the possibility to restore the @xmath25-stability .",
    "the @xmath10 light four - quark states have been studied in @xcite using the scalar diquark - antidiquark currents , which does not support a mass below 2 gev . however , as noted earlier , the coefficients of four - quark condensates have been found to be zero in the ope @xcite , which raises some doubts on the resulting accuracy of the sum rules . furthermore , the @xmath25-stability is not reached in @xcite , suggesting that the currents used in @xcite may not provide sufficiently reliable sum rules .",
    "therefore , here we use diquark - antidiquark vector currents which can couple to both the @xmath1 and @xmath10 four - quark states .",
    "the lorentz structures of the @xmath42 diquark anti - diquark vector currents have been systematically studied in @xcite for the charmonium - like states .",
    "here we use the @xmath43 currents of the same lorentz structures ( under isospin symmetry , @xmath44 and @xmath45 share the same sum rules with @xmath43 at leading order ) : @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 have the color structure @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 have the color structure @xmath56 . since the states of different isospin are degenerate in masses at leading order ( lo )",
    ", we do not differentiate the isospin in our calculation .",
    "after performing the svz expansion in the chiral limit ( @xmath57 ) to lo of the perturbation series , we arrive at the following expression for the correlation function ( up to dimension-8 condensate contributions ) resulting from @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) : @xmath60 where the coefficients @xmath61 are listed in table  [ tab : coeff ] .",
    "light hybrid meson , where the contributions from the gluon condensates are comparable to those from the quark condensates . ]    .[tab : coeff ] the coefficients for eq .. [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      as mentioned previously , the sum rules for currents of different color structures at lo are only slightly different ( we will see this more obviously in this and the next subsection ) .",
    "what affects the behaviour of the sum rules considerably are the lorentz structures of the currents , by which we will categorize the currents in our analyses .",
    "for each category , if stability is reached ( with a suitably converging ope for lsr ) , we will extract the mass considering the effects of violation of factorization as a source of theoretical uncertainty in our analysis .",
    "we first consider the lsr for @xmath47 and @xmath52 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : slj1j2 ] , the lsr for both @xmath62 and @xmath63 reach the @xmath24-stability ( which is lost after considering violation of factorization ) .",
    "however , the masses obtained from the @xmath24-stability points increase gradually with @xmath25 , which means the @xmath25-stability is not reached and thus @xmath25 can not be determined from the lsr for @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we consider the following values obtained at @xmath64 ( assuming the mass of the lowest - lying state is below 2 gev , which is consistent with the subsequent analyses resulting from other currents ) : m_s1;l&=&1.78  gev  at  s_0=5.0  gev^2 , + m_s2;l&=&1.78  gev  at  s_0=5.0  gev^2 .",
    "the fesr for @xmath65 and @xmath63 also do not reach stability , which can be seen in fig .",

    "again the @xmath74-stability is absent .",
