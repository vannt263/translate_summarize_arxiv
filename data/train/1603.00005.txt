    "the clic ( compact linear collider ) project has a beam transportation line in order to deliver the beam from main linac to ir ( interaction region ) and demagnify the beam into desired parameters at the ir @xcite .",
    "we use the layout of the bds described in the cdr @xcite .",
    "the layout is shown in figure  [ fig : bds ] .",
    "after acceleration to full beam energy in the linac , the beam enters the diagnostics section of the bds where the beam properties are measured and corrected .",
    "the beam then traverses the energy collimation section , where off - momentum particles are removed .",
    "of particular interest for this study is the third section , the betatron betatron collimation section , which is designed to remove halo particles .",
    "it is followed by the final focus region which has strong magnets to focus the beam to the required beam parameters at the interaction point .",
    "halo particles will be generated by scattering processes like beam - gas scattering .",
    "other sources of generating and enhancing the beam halo include optics effects like mismatch and dispersion , and equipment related effects like noise or mechanical vibrations  @xcite . for the study presented here",
    ", we use halo distributions generated by the well known elastic and inelastic interactions of the beam with the residual gas .",
    "the halo is removed in the betatron collimation section by the combination of spoilers and absorbers .",
    "the large amplitude particles which constitute the beam halo will typically first interact with the relatively thin spoilers which are closest to the beam axis , and then be stopped by the thicker absorbers .",
    "there is a small but finite probability that muons are produced in these interactions .",
    "muons are much harder to stop and may reach the interaction region and deteriorate the detector performance .",
    "the goal of the study presented here is the mitigation of this secondary muon flux into the detector region .",
    "we propose magnetized muon shields , designed to sweep away and absorb the majority of the muons before they reach the detector region .",
    "we propose a design with a toroidal magnetic field , which is zero on the beam axis . we have considered two options , one based on permanent magnets and another on normal conducting magnets .",
    "the magnetic field homogeneity depends on number of sm - co blocks in the permanent magnet option .",
    "this is shown for different numbers of sm - co blocks in figure  [ fig : smco ] .",
    "the average field depends on the number of sm - co blocks in the magnet .",
    "the magnetic field values fluctuate between 1.6 t and 0.8 t for 2 blocks sm - co option . for 16 blocks sm - co ,",
    "the magnetic field fluctuation is reduced to values close 1.2 t as shown in figure  [ fig : smco ] .",
    "the other option is based on normal conducting coils , which produce an azimuthally symmetric field shown in figure  [ fig : normal ] .",
    "the power consumption is estimated at about 120w for a single 2 meter section .",
    "the current density is 0.8a",
    "/ mm@xmath0 which allows for an air cooled system .",
    "the inner and outer radius of the sweeper in all options is 4 cm and 60 cm , respectively .",
    "the beam delivery system contains four sets of spoilers and absorbers in the betatron collimation section .",
    "we perform detailed , high statistics simulations of the betatron collimation with muon production and absorption .",
    "the muon sweepers are implemented in the simulation studies as 2.5 m long modules with 4 cm inner radius and 60 cm outer radius , with 0.7 t or 1.2 t magnetic fields .",
    "for the first set of simulations , four modules , each 10 m long with 10 cm space between them , have been placed after each vertical absorber in the betatron collimation section .",
    "this option has 40 m long magnetized shielding in total .    for comparison",
    ", we also re - considered the spoiler size and location from the earlier study described in ref  @xcite , now based on the more realistic spoiler design presented here and using the updated version of bdsim . in the previous study ,",
    "the muon sweepers have been placed after each horizontal and vertical absorber , adding up to a total shield length of 80 m .",
    "we have simulated this by placing 32 of our 2.5 m long modules after each absorber as listed in table  [ table:1 ] .        as a result of this work ,",
    "the permanent magnet and normal conducting coil options have been compared with each other by means of magnetic field homogeneity for muon sweeper .",
    "the muon sweeper parameters have been updated by taking into account the previous study with updated version of bdsim .",
    "roughly a factor of 10 reduction have been reached up with 1.2 t homogeneous magnetic in the simulations .",
