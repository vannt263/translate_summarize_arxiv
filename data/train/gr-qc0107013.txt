    "nonlinear phenomena have been one of the most popular topics during last years . nevertheless , it must be admitted that nonlinear classical fields have not received general consideration .",
    "this is probably due to the mathematical difficulties which arise because of the nonrenormalizability of the fermi and other nonlinear couplings  @xcite .",
    "nonlinear selfcouplings of the spinor fields may arise as a consequence of the geometrical structure of the space - time and , more precisely , because of the existence of torsion .",
    "as soon as 1938 , ivanenko @xcite showed that a relativistic theory imposes in some cases a fourth order selfcoupling . in 1950",
    "weyl  @xcite proved that , if the affine and the metric properties of the space - time are taken as independent , the spinor field obeys either a linear equation in a space with torsion or a nonlinear one in a reimannian space .",
    "as the selfaction is of spin - spin type , it allows the assignment of a dynamical role to the spin and offers a clue about the origin of the nonlinearities .",
    "this question was further clarifed in some important papers by utiyama , kibble and sciama  @xcite in the simplest scheme the selfaction is of pseudovector type , but it can be shown that one can also get a scalar coupling  @xcite .",
    "an exelent review of the problem may be found in  @xcite .",
    "nonlinear quantum dirac fields were used by heisenberg  @xcite in his ambitious unified theory of elementary particles .",
    "they are presently the object of renewed interest since the widely known paper by gross and neveu  @xcite    the quantum field theory in curved space - time has been a matter of great interest in recent years because of its applications to cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "the evidence of existence of strong gravitational fields in our universe led to the study of the quantum effects of material fields in external classical gravitational field .",
    "after the appearance of parker s paper on scalar fields  @xcite and spin-@xmath1 fields ,  @xcite several authors have studied this subject .",
    "the present cosmology is based largely on friedmann s solutions of the einstein equations which describe the completely uniform and isotropic universe ( closed and open models , i.e. , bounded or unbounded universe ) . the main feature of these solutions is their non - stationarity .",
    "the idea of expanding universe , following from this property , is confirmed by the astronomical observations and it now safe to assume that the isotropic model provides , in its general features , an adequate description of the present state of the universe .",
    "although the universe seems homogenous and isotropic at present , it does not necessarily mean that it is also suitable for description of the early stages of the development of the universe and there are no observational data guarantying the isotropy in the era prior to the recombination .",
    "in fact , there are theoretical arguments that sustain the existence of an anisotropic phase that approaches an isotropic one  @xcite .",
    "interest in studying klein - gordon and dirac equations in anisotropic models has increased since hu and parker  @xcite have shown that the creation of scalar particles in anisotropic backgrounds can dissipate the anisotropy as the universe expands .    a bianchi type - i ( b - i ) universe , being the straightforward generalization of the flat robertson - walker ( rw ) universe , is one of the simplest models of an anisotropic universe that describes a homogenous and spatially flat universe . unlike the rw universe which has the same scale factor for each of the three spatial directions , a b - i universe has a different scale factor in each direction , thereby introducing an anisotropy to the system .",
    "it moreover has the agreeable property that near the singularity it behaves like a kasner universe , even in the presence of matter , and consequently falls within the general analysis of the singularity given by belinskii et al  @xcite .",
    "also in a universe filled with matter for @xmath2 , it has been shown that any initial anisotropy in a b - i universe quickly dies away and a b - i universe eventually evolves into a frw universe  @xcite .",
    "since the present - day universe is surprisingly isotropic , this feature of the b - i universe makes it a prime candidate for studying the possible effects of an anisotropy in the early universe on present - day observations . in light of the importance of",
    "mentioned above , several authors have studied b - i universe from different aspects .    in  @xcite chimento and mollerach studied the dirac equations in b - i universe and obtained their classical solutions .",
    "they also claimed that for each value of the momentum only two independent solutions exist and showed that it is not possible to obtain the solutions from those of a frw universe only by perturbation .",
    "one of the solutions obtained would describe a particle with a given helicity , while the other one would represent antiparticles with the opposite helicity .",
    "this fact posed a very interesting problem , spin-@xmath3 particles can not live in a b - i , at least if they keep their well - known properties of flat space - time .",
    "this problem was handled by castagnino et al  @xcite where they showed that if the dirac equation is separable , the number of independent solution is four , contrary to the claim made in  @xcite .    in a number of papers  @xcite",
    "several authors studied the behavior of gravitational waves ( gw s ) in a b - i universe . in  @xcite the evolution equations for small perturbations in the metric , energy density , and material velocity",
    "were derived for an anisotropic viscous b - i universe.it has been shown that the results were independent of the equation of state of the cosmic fluid and its viscosity .",
    "they also showed that the gws need not necessarily be transversal in an anisotropically expanding b - i universe and the longitudinal components of the gravitational waves have no physical significance . in  @xcite cho and speliotopoulos studied the propagation of classical gravitational waves in b - i universe .",
    "they found that gws in b - i universe are not equivalent to two minimally coupled massless scalar fields as in frw universe . because of its tensorial nature",
    ", the gw is much more sensitive to the anisotropy in space - time than the scalar field is and it gains an effective mass term .",
    "moreover , they found a coupling between the two polarization states of the gw which is not present in a frw universe .",
    "nonlinear spinor field ( nlsf ) in external frw cosmological gravitational field was first studied by g.n .",
    "shikin in 1991  @xcite .",
    "the main purpose to introduce a nonlinear term in the spinor field lagrangian is to study the possibility of elimination of initial singularity .",
    "following  @xcite , we analyzed the nonlinear spinor field equations in an external b - i universe  @xcite . in that paper",
    "we consider the nonlinear term in the spinor field lagrangian as an arbitrary function of all possible invariants generated from spinor bilinear forms .",
    "there we also studied the possibility of elimination of initial singularity especially for the kasner universe . for few years we studied the behavior of self - consistent nlsf in",
    "a b - i universe  @xcite both in presence of perfect fluid and without it that was followed by the refs . ,",
    "@xcite where we studied the self - consistent system of interacting spinor and scalar fields .",
    "recently , we study  @xcite the role of the cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) in the lagrangian which together with newton s gravitational constant ( @xmath4 ) is considered as the fundamental constants in einstein s theory of gravity  @xcite .",
    "a diagonal bianchi type - i space - time ( hereafter b - i ) is a spatially homogeneous space - time which admits an abelian group @xmath5 , acting on spacelike hypersurfaces , generated by the spacelike killing vectors @xmath6 . in synchronous coordinates the metric is @xcite : @xmath7 if the three scale factors are equal ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) , ( [ bib ] ) describes an isotropic and spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe .",
    "the b - i universe has a different scale factor in each direction , thereby introducing an anisotropy to the system .",
    "thus , a bianchi type - i ( b - i ) universe , being the straightforward generalization of the flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe , is one of the simplest models of an anisotropic universe that describes a homogenous and spatially flat universe .",
    "when the two of the metric functions are equal ( e.g. @xmath9 ) the b - i space - time is reduce to the important class of plane symmetric space - time ( a special class of the locally rotational symmetric space - times  @xcite ) which admit a @xmath10 group of isometries acting multiply transitively on the spacelike hypersurfaces of homogeneity generated by the vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the b - i has the agreeable property that near the singularity it behaves like a kasner universe , given by @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the parameters of the b - i space - time which measure the relative anisotropy between any two asymmetry axis and satisfy the constraints    [ kc ] @xmath15    thus out of three parameters , only one is arbitrary .",
