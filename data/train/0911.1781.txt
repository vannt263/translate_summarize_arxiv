    "studies of the chemical compositions of these stars suggest that they form an evolutionary sequence @xcite .",
    "there are two leading scenarios to explain the origin of extreme helium stars . in one scenario , the merger of a he - star or a he - core wd with a carbon / oxygen core wd forms a hydrogen - deficient supergiant @xcite .",
    "the other scenario , commonly referred to as the born - again scenario , suggests that a hydrogen - deficient star forms when a post - asymptotic giant branch star experiences a late helium shell flash ( see * ? ? ?",

    "this flash converts the hydrogen - rich envelope to helium , creating a hydrogen - deficient star .",

    "they propose the wd merger scenario as a likely formation mechanism . based on preliminary calculations , @xcite",

    "they will merge within 100 myr to 8.4 gyr and form extreme helium stars , j0822 + 2753 may become an am cvn system instead ( see section 6.5 ) . ] .",
    "therefore , these 3 systems provide independent evidence that there is a mechanism to form hydrogen deficient stars through wd mergers .",
    "close binary evolution plays an important role in the formation of subdwarf b stars , as witnessed by the large fraction ( @xmath108% ) of sdb stars in binaries .",
    "mass transfer between the companions and common - envelope evolution can lead to large amount of mass loss prior to the start of core he - burning , creating an sdb star in a binary .",

    "depending on when this flash happens , sdb or he - enriched sdo stars form .    only about 4% of he - enriched sdo stars are in binary systems @xcite .",
    "the mergers of two he - core wds can explain the lower fraction of binaries observed among the he - enriched sdo stars @xcite .",
    "with shrinking separation , the less massive object is accreted onto the companion , leading to he ignition @xcite .",
    "the merger product will be enriched in cno , similar to the observed abundances of he - enriched sdo stars @xcite .",

    "the recent discoveries of planets around the subdwarf b stars v pegasi @xcite and hd 149382 @xcite show that this channel of formation contributes to the single subdwarf b star population .",
    "there is a 70% chance that the companion to one of our targets , j1053 + 5200 , is a low - mass he - core wd .",
    "the merger of this binary wd system will most likely create a he - enriched sdo star .",
    "hence , binary mergers of two he - core wds contribute to the single hot subdwarf population in the galaxy .",
    "sne ia are caused by the thermonuclear explosion of wds growing to the chandrasekhar mass either by accretion from a companion or by mergers of two degenerate stars .",
    "the double degenerate scenario requires mainly mergers of two co wds to have sufficient mass to exceed the chandrasekhar mass limit @xcite .",
    "however , if the mass transfer is stable , accretion from a he - core wd can also result in accumulation of chandrasekhar mass by the co wd accretor and this can result in a sn ia explosion . the population synthesis models by @xcite demonstrate that the expected contribution of he+co wd binaries to the sne ia rate is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the co+co wd systems .",
    "the visible components of the four binaries discussed in this paper are 0.17 - 0.24 @xmath31 wds .",

    "our targets are most likely not sne ia progenitors .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a new mechanism for the detonation of a sub - chandrasekhar mass co wd through accretion from a low - mass he - core wd .",
    "if the mass accretion is dynamically unstable , the instabilities in the accretion stream can lead to the detonation of surface helium that accumulates on the co primary during the final few orbits prior to merger .",
    "these detonations are likely to resemble dim type ia sne ( or .ia , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and would primarily synthesize intermediate - mass elements . under certain conditions , the primary itself is also detonated . an important feature of this mechanism is that the total system mass does not need to exceed the chandrasekhar limit . as such , the systems we present in this paper could very well be the progenitor systems for these events .",
    "green bank telescope observations do not detect milli - second pulsar companions around our targets .",
    "however , neutron star companions can not be ruled out based on the radio data alone .",

    "they find that , once the white dwarf has filled its roche lobe , it is disrupted in a few orbital periods , e.g. on the order of 5 minutes .",
    "the final configuration consists of a neutron star surrounded by an accretion disk , and the mass loss from the system is negligible .",

    "these donors have initial masses larger than 0.32 - 0.35 @xmath31 and they somehow survive disruption in the merger with the ns .",
    "therefore , 0.2 @xmath31 wds may also survive mergers with neutron stars .",
    "am cvn stars are interacting double stars with wd accretors and orbital periods less than about one hour .",
