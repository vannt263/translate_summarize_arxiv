    "kenyon and peres @xcite showed that for an nc carpet there is a unique measure of full hausdorff dimension . using a coding map constructed by a markov partition for @xmath14 one obtains a symbolic representation of the carpet which is a full shift on finitely many symbols . _ _    in this paper , we consider a more general set whose symbolic representation is a shift of finite type rather than a full shift .",
