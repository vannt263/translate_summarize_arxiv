    "according to the naive non - relativistic quark model , the meson is composed of a pair of quark and anti - quark .",
    "the neutral mesons do not carry the quantum numbers such as @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , the non - conventional mesons such as the hybrid meson , tetraquark states and glueballs are allowed in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and can have these quantum numbers .",
    "sometimes these states are denoted as the exotic states in order to emphasize the difference from the mesons within the quark model .",
    "in fact , the exotic quantum numbers provide a powerful handle to probe the non - perturbative behavior of qcd @xcite . in this work we focus on the the exotic meson with @xmath3 , which is a good candidate of the hybrid meson and tetraquark state .",
    "there are three candidates with @xmath3 : @xmath4 , @xmath1 and @xmath5 .",
    "their masses and widths are ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) mev , ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) mev and ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) mev  @xcite respectively .",
    "@xmath1 was first observed in the reaction @xmath12 in 1998 @xcite .",
    "later the @xmath13 was confirmed in the @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 @xcite and @xmath16 channels@xcite .",
    "some experiments also indicated the possible existence of @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the existence of @xmath5 awaits further experimental confirmation .",
    "this state was not included in the pdg since 2010  @xcite .",
    "the current status of the @xmath4 and @xmath1 is a little murky .",
    "there exist speculations that the @xmath4 might be non - resonant or it may be a tetraquark candidate instead of a hybrid meson . although there also exist other possible theoretical explanations such as a tetraquark candidate @xcite or a molecule / four - quark mixture @xcite , the @xmath1 remains a popular candidate of the light hybrid meson @xcite .",
    "the present calculation is based on the following three facts : the @xmath17 exotic quantum number , the su(3 ) flavor structure and the current available decay modes . in other words , it s applicable to all possible interpretations of the @xmath18 mesons .",
    "there are many investigations of the @xmath17 light hybrid meson mass in literature @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 mass extracted from the quenched lattice qcd simulation ranges from 1.74 gev  @xcite and 1.8 gev  @xcite to 2 gev  @xcite , which is significantly larger than the experimental value .",
    "this apparent discrepancy is slightly disturbing .",
    "one possible reason may be due to the fact that all these lattice qcd simulations were performed with quenched configurations and rather large pion mass on the lattice .",
    "one may wonder whether such a discrepancy may be removed with dynamical lattice qcd simulations using physical pion mass",
    ". then one may make chiral extrapolations to extract the physical mass of the hybrid meson .    in this work",
    "we shall derive the explicit expressions of the non - analytical chiral corrections to the @xmath1 mass up to one - loop order , which may be used to make the chiral extrapolations if the dynamical lattice qcd simulations are available . throughout our analysis",
    ", we focus on the variation of the @xmath1 meson mass with @xmath19 or @xmath20 . in the @xmath21 chiral limit @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath24 chiral limit is adopted where @xmath25 and @xmath26 remains finite .",
    "then , the eta meson mass does not vanish due to the large strange quark mass .",

    "[ sec2 ] and present the formalism in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we present the numerical results and conclude .",
    "in order to calculate the chiral corrections to the @xmath1 meson mass up to the one loop order , we first construct the effective chiral lagrangian @xcite , which can be expressed as follows @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the free part @xmath29    according to the decay modes of @xmath1 , we can write down the interaction terms @xmath30    because of the chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking , all the pionic coupling constants should vanish when either the pion momentum or its mass goes to zero .",
    "the s - wave coupling constants @xmath31 and @xmath32 arise from the finite current quark mass correction . therefore , these coupling constants are proportional to @xmath33 , @xmath34    the @xmath35 decay mode may lead to the two - loop self energy diagram @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ three_pi_loop ] .",
    "we ignore the contribution from this diagram since we focus on the chiral corrections to the @xmath1 mass up to the one - loop order in this work .",
    "moreover , some contribution of this two - loop diagram may have been partly included in the one - loop diagram with the intermediate @xmath36 and @xmath37 meson because the @xmath36 meson is the two pion resonance .     with three intermediate @xmath37 mesons .",
    "]    further more , we need the chiral interaction between the @xmath1 and the pseudo scalar mesons , which is similar to the chiral lagrangians of the vector mesons @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that the @xmath38 interaction is forbidden by the g - parity conservation .",
    "we have @xmath39    for the @xmath40 and @xmath41 interaction , we have @xmath42    in order to absorb the divergence in the one - loop chiral corrections , we need the following counter terms @xmath43 @xmath44 is similar to the chiral lagrangians of the vector mesons in the form of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the vector meson and the notation @xmath48 is related to the current quark mass .",
    "with the above preparation , we start to calculate the chiral corrections to the mass of @xmath1 . the propagator of the @xmath1 is defined as @xmath49 where p is the four momenta of @xmath18 . at the lowest order",
    ", the propagator simply reads @xmath50 and its inverse is @xmath51 here , @xmath52 denotes the bare mass of @xmath1 .",
    "we separate the self energy @xmath53 into the transversal and longitudinal parts @xmath54    the full propagator reads @xmath55^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be expressed as @xmath56 only the transverse part @xmath57 will shift the pole position",
    ". therefore we concentrate on the transversal part of the self energy @xcite and consider all the feynman diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ pi1selfenergy ] and fig .",
    "[ counterterms ] .",
    "the @xmath1 mass satisfies the relation @xmath58     with one light meson plus one @xmath37 or @xmath59 . ]    in order to obtain the quark mass ( @xmath60 ) dependence of the self energy corrections , it is convenient to adopt the infrared regularization ( ir ) scheme @xcite to calculate the loop integrals . usually , the ir method is used in order not to break the power counting while dealing with the integral .",
    "unfortunately , there does nt exist a proper power counting rule for the issue we are dealing with .",
    "there are a few different mass scales such as the @xmath18 mass , the @xmath61 meson masses , the masses of other meson resonances , and the chiral symmetry breaking scale .",
    "the mass of the @xmath18 is so high that the @xmath61 and other light mesons can take large momenta , and thus the convergence of a chiral expansion is not ensured .",
    "however , for our purpose , the ir method still can be used to derive the non - analytic part of an integral .",
    "the non - analytical chiral corrections to the self - energy of the @xmath18 are inherent and intrinsic due to the presence of the chiral fields , and the non - analytical chiral structures are universal and model independent to a large extent .",
    "one may derive them using very different theoretical approaches such chiral quark model , effective chiral lagrangians at the hadronic level or rigorous chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "with chpt , one can include both analytical and non - analytical corrections order by order with consistent power counting .",
    "in contrast , with the effective chiral lagrangians at the hadronic level as employed in this work , there does not exist consistent power counting .",
    "fortunately , the non - analytical corrections from different approaches are similar if one considers the one - loop diagrams .",
    "the non - analytical structures may play an important role in the chiral extrapolation of the dynamical lattice qcd simulation of the @xmath17 exotic meson mass , which is sensitive to the pion mass on the lattice . within the ir scheme ,",
    "the so - called infrared singular part turns out to be the main contribution of the loop integral in the chiral limit .",
    "however , one can also find the full expressions of these loop integrals by performing the standard lorentz invariant calculation in refs.@xcite .    for a certain diagram , there are three mass scales , @xmath62 and the masses of the two intermediate states @xmath63 .",
    "we assume @xmath64 .",
    "the main contribution of a loop integral comes from the poles of the propagators , which are called as the soft poles and hard poles in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when one expands the loop integral in terms of the small parameters such as @xmath65 or @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the renormalization scale , one notices that the soft part contribution contains all the terms which are non - analytic in the expansion parameter .",
    "in contrast , the hard part is a local polynomial in these parameters which can be absorbed by the low energy constants of higher order lagrangians @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in the small chiral fluctuations around the mass shell of @xmath1 , we set the kinematical region @xmath68 .",
    "in particular , we set the the regularization scale to be @xmath62 .",
    "these self - energy diagrams can be divided into two categories",
    ". the first class of diagrams fulfills the condition @xmath69 and @xmath70 , including those diagrams with the @xmath71 and @xmath14 as the intermediate states .",
    "the second class corresponds to the condition @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where the intermediate states are the @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
