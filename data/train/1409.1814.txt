    "interference resulting from quantum coherence causes an abundance of effects that contradict our classical intuition .",
    "most people would probably be inclined to negate both the interference of independent photons @xcite or of mesoscopic molecules @xcite if there was no clear experimental evidence for the existence of both effects ; and despite the fact that interference phenomena in quantum mechanical systems have been observed for more than a century , we can still find large missing pieces in our understanding of quantum coherence .",
    "the fact that a coherent superposition of at least two path alternatives ( two state - vectors in a more general , abstract description ) is necessary for an _ interference pattern _ to emerge , and that the achievable contrast increases with the number of states that are coherently over - imposed is one of the best established notions of elementary physics .",
    "however , going beyond this qualitative observation , our intuition is typically not able to answer the question of how many path - alternatives are needed to generate a particular interference pattern with reduced contrast .",
    "the overall aim of this paper is to explore the information content stored in the interference pattern , and to develop a framework which addresses the above question .",
    "the formal definition of quantum coherence requires a set of mutually orthogonal states @xmath0 , @xmath1 with respect to which coherence is defined . in an interferometric situation these states would correspond to different path alternatives and the number of paths that are being taken coherently is often referred to in terms of the lateral coherence length . in the case of molecular networks one is typically interested in the number of chromophores over which an excitation is coherently distributed , so that coherent delocalization is defined in terms of the excited states of the individual chromophores @xcite ; and in transport theory or quantum thermodynamics this reference basis is given by energy eigenstates @xcite .    in general , a pure state @xmath2 is considered @xmath3-coherent in terms of a given set of basis states @xmath0 , if at least @xmath3 of the amplitudes @xmath4 are non - vanishing .",
    "since decoherence processes which are unavoidably present in actual physical situations result in the deterioration of quantum coherence , the description in terms of mixed states or density matrices becomes necessary . as every mixed state @xmath5",
    "can intuitively be understood as an average over pure states , averaging over _ incoherent _ states @xmath6 will not result in any interference phenomena .",
    "consequently , any mixed state @xmath7 that can be decomposed into a mixture of incoherent states with @xmath8 is considered incoherent .",
    "analogously , every mixed state that can be expressed in terms of an average over pure states with no more than @xmath3-coherence is _ not _ @xmath9-coherent .",
    "this motivates the commonly employed definition @xcite that a mixed state @xmath10 is @xmath3-coherent , if any ensemble @xmath11 that satisfies @xmath12 for some set of probabilities @xmath13 contains at least one @xmath3-coherent state vector .",
    "the notion of @xmath3-coherence is thus similar to the concept of multipartite entanglement , since a mixed state is called @xmath3-partite entangled if any of its ensemble decompositions involves at least one @xmath3-partite entangled pure state @xcite .",
    "quantum coherence has recently been recognized as a resource @xcite in the sense that there are processes whose realization is facilitated by the consumption of coherence .",
    "various tools known from the entanglement theory have thus been adapted for the classification and quantification of quantum coherence @xcite .",
    "reconstruction of the complete density matrix is required to assess most of these tools , and only few schemes work with fewer observables to be measured @xcite . on the one hand",
    ", this fact poses a rather high threshold for the analysis of coherence in laboratory experiments , and , on the other hand , the abstract nature of the aforementioned tools limits the intuition that might be gained from their use",
    ".    we will strive for the identification of quantum coherence based on the interference pattern only .",
    "if an interference pattern can be decomposed into a sum of patterns resulting from @xmath3-path interference , then , this pattern does not permit to conclude on @xmath9-coherence ( as exemplarily depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : interferencemixed ] for @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "we will therefore identify ( in section ii ) properties of interference pattern asserting that such a decomposition is not possible . in section iii",
    "we provide numerical evidence underlining the performance of the tools developed in section ii .",
    "the numerical studies have been designed to capture major practical issues , such as difficulties with the proper identification of the maximum of a complicated interference pattern , or its coarse graining .    ]",
    "we consider a rather general physical situation in which a superposition of different states is being established , and a certain level of decoherence results in the fact that this superposition is not perfectly coherent .",
    "a specific realization of such a situation would be a mach - zehnder type of interferometer , as schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : interference ] for @xmath14 , where the different path - alternatives define the basis states @xmath16 .    ]",
    "an incoming object impinges on a beam - splitter ( bs ) , that creates a coherent superposition of the basis states .",
    "the phase shifters @xmath17 permit to generate an interference pattern that can be read off , once the object has crossed the second beam splitter .",
    "the interference pattern @xmath18 with @xmath19 is defined as the normalized probability distribution to observe an object in the output mode , where @xmath5 is the state before crossing the second beam splitter . since on average only one out of @xmath20 objects exits through the output mode ,",
    "the interference pattern is given in terms of an over - normalized state with @xmath21 .",
    "the simplest case of @xmath22 path alternatives corresponds to the original mach - zehnder - interferometer , in which one can record the interference pattern by tuning a single phase shifter . in general , the interference pattern is obtained by tuning @xmath23 phase shifters . beyond the obvious increase of dimensionality , also the structure of the pattern",
    "typically gets more complicated with growing @xmath20 since the dependence of the detection probabilities on the phases @xmath17 gets more sensitive .",
    "our aim shall thus be to capture a more global part of the desired information , which is robust against small deviations of the tuned parameters .",
    "to this end we examine various _ moments _ of the interference pattern in question .",
    "one can certainly obtain some information on coherence from the maximum of the interference pattern @xmath24 as its value , when larger than @xmath25 , unambiguously identifies @xmath5 to be @xmath3-coherent . in practice , however , this is not necessarily the best choice .",
    "in particular , for highly coherent states , the interference pattern is a rapidly oscillating function so that optimizations will often identify only local maxima with a resulting under - estimation of coherence properties . since , again , for highly coherent states , the optimum is given by a very narrow peak , an extremely accurate reconstruction of the interference pattern becomes necessary .",
    "a much more practical alternative would be to employ the uniform statistical moments @xmath26 the first moment @xmath27 is just the norm of the interference pattern , but the higher moments carry non - trivial information .",
    "one would expect that increasing the order of moments improves the identification of @xmath3-coherence , because taking the limit @xmath28 is equivalent to finding the maximum ( [ max ] ) . on the other hand the required accuracy of the reconstructed pattern ( _ e.g. _ from experimental data ) necessary to assess a moment grows with @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "we thus strive for an approach that is based on moments of reasonably low order , which are more robust against small deviations of the interference pattern . in order to find a good compromise between a sensitive identification and robustness with respect to imperfections",
    ", we utilize the _ generalized moments _",
    "@xmath30 defined in terms of a suitably chosen @xmath20-dimensional probability distribution @xmath31 .",
    "the simplest case @xmath32 reproduces the uniform moments eq .",
    "( [ uniform ] ) . in the opposite case ,",
    "when @xmath31 is strongly localized around the maximum of the interference pattern , the value of the generalized moment @xmath33 approximates the maximum @xmath34 .",
    "this specific choice calls for the search of an optimal probability distribution which might be flawed by the same issues as encountered for eq .  .",
    "with a sufficiently wide distribution @xmath35 , on the other hand , the optimization landscape is substantially flatter than in eq .   what eases the optimization a lot .",
    "using the generalized moments of low order together with the distribution @xmath35 encoding additional information , namely the expected position of the maximum of the interference pattern , one can reasonably merge advantages of both interference peaks ( eq .  ) and regular statistical moments ( eq .  ) , avoiding complications brought by each of two approaches alone .      since the interference pattern defined in eq .",
    "is given in terms of all the phases @xmath36 as independent variables , it is reasonable to define @xmath31 in terms of independent distributions for each phase , _ i.e. _ @xmath37 .",
    "the variable @xmath38 is thus distributed according to @xmath39 , with @xmath40 having the same functional form for all @xmath36 . by @xmath41",
    "we denote the expectation value of each of these distributions . although strictly speaking not necessary",
    ", we will assume equal width of all distributions and denote their standard deviation by @xmath42 .",
    "an evaluation of eq .   requires the construction of so - called _ trigonometric moments _",
    "@xmath43 @xcite defined for any integer @xmath29 . due to the fact , that the phases @xmath36 are defined only in an interval of width of @xmath44 , this step can be done explicitly for most typically employed distributions like the lorentz or gauss distributions . to this end , it is helpful to take advantage of a _ wrapped _ version of a distribution @xcite . in the case of the wrapped normal distribution ,",
    "the trigonometric moments are equal to the characteristic function of the normal ( unwrapped ) distribution evaluated at integer arguments , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 . with the help of the function @xmath47 one can perform the integration in eq .   and express the generalized moments as @xmath48    as argued above , the use of low order moments is desirable .",
    "we will therefore focus in the following on @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "there is however no fundamental obstacle for generalizations to higher values of @xmath29 .      before one can use the moments defined in eqs .   or to rigorously identify coherence properties , one needs to find the maximum that @xmath33 can adopt for @xmath3-coherent states .",
    "in the present case such an optimization can be done explicitly , confirming that the maximum among all @xmath3-coherent states is provided by @xmath52 _",
    "i.e. _ a perfectly balanced coherent superposition of @xmath3 basis states .    to arrive at this conclusion , one may first realize that the generalized moments @xmath33 are convex , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath53 for @xmath54 and any pair of density matrices @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the two facts that the @xmath57 power of a linear functional like @xmath58 is convex for @xmath59 , and that the integral @xmath60 preserves convexity as @xmath35 is non - negative .",
    "since states @xmath10 that are at most @xmath3-coherent ( for any value of @xmath3 ) define a convex set ( _ i.e. _ @xmath61 is no more than @xmath3-coherent ) the maximum of @xmath33 over @xmath3-coherent density matrices is always reached for a pure state .    the most general @xmath3-coherent pure state reads @xmath62 assuming ( without loss of generality ) that exactly the first @xmath3 basis states are comprised with non - vanishing weights @xmath63 in the coherent superposition . in appendix [ sec : derivation - of - threshold - values ] it is shown that the optimization of the phase factors @xmath64 can be performed independently of the optimization over the real amplitudes @xmath63 , and that the maximum is obtained if the @xmath65 coincide with the expectation values @xmath41 of @xmath66 .",
    "also the remaining optimization over the @xmath63 can be performed very generally .",
    "as further shown in appendix [ sec : derivation - of - threshold - values ] , the quantity to be optimized is a schur - concave function which is maximized for @xmath67 for @xmath68 .    summarizing the above considerations , the maximum of @xmath33 that can be adopted for @xmath3-coherent states with a given distribution @xmath35 reads @xmath69 with the coefficients @xmath70 given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "any excess of this threshold value is an unambiguous identification of coherence properties beyond @xmath3-coherence .",
    "coefficients @xmath70 that characterize the threshold values in eq .   for @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the index @xmath71 runs from @xmath72 to @xmath73 and @xmath74 is a short hand notation .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results of our numerical analysis are presented in table [ tab : detection_ratios_random_states ] . comparing @xmath75 with the ratios @xmath76 in the suboptimal setting ( positive @xmath77 ) , we confirm the previous observation that the performance of the moments ( those with narrow distributions ) can be highly sensitive to uncertainty of @xmath78 .",
    "similarly to the case of the first ensemble investigated , the second and third moment with positive width @xmath42 can significantly increase the detection ratio in this suboptimal setting .",
    "in section [ sec2 ] we showed that the generalized moments @xmath33 are convex with respect to the density matrix , what further implies that their maxima are provided by pure states ( see eq .  ) .",
    "the identification of the maximum value of @xmath33 that can be taken for mixed states with given purity , thus allows to strengthen the detection of coherence in mixed states .",
    "as we explicitly demonstrate here for the case @xmath50 , there are however strongly mixed states that yield values of @xmath79 close to the achievable maximum . that is , the present approach is by no means limited to pure or weakly mixed states , but",
    ", it can indeed identify @xmath3-coherence also for substantially mixed states .    in appendix",
    "[ sec : derivation - of - maximum ] we show that the global maximum @xmath80 taken over all states with given purity @xmath81 is obtained for the state @xmath82 with @xmath83 defined in eq .  .",
    "moreover , any state of the form eq .   with purity @xmath84 is at most @xmath3-coherent .",
    "@xmath85 is thus the smallest purity that permits to identify @xmath9-coherence with the present moments .",
    "[ fig : opt ] depicts @xmath86 as function of @xmath81 ( solid curve ) , and @xmath87 for a @xmath88-dimensional system with @xmath89 .",
    "the symbols ( triangles , rectangles , circles ) depict the numerically obtained maximum @xmath90 of @xmath79 with the maximization performed over all at most @xmath3-coherent states with given purity ( see eq .   in the appendix ) ; the horizontal lines depict the corresponding values for @xmath91 to guide the eye .     depict the numerically obtained , purity - dependent threshold values of @xmath3-coherence for @xmath92 in a @xmath93-dimensional system and @xmath89 .",
    "the solid curve denotes the analytical result obtained for the state ( [ state1 ] ) .",
    "the horizontal lines denote the original threshold values obtained by pure states .",
    "[ fig : opt ] ]    as one can see , the values @xmath90 coincide with @xmath86 for @xmath94 ; for @xmath95 , @xmath90 is nearly constant , _",
    "i.e. _ there is a very small increase with @xmath81 .",
    "this means , that there are rather highly mixed @xmath9-coherent states that yield values above the threshold values of @xmath90 for @xmath3-coherence .",
    "the approach developed hitherto is thus able to identify coherence reliably even for rather strongly mixed states , even if no information on purity is available .",
    "since the range over which @xmath90 is nearly constant , is the larger ( _ i.e. _ including lower values of @xmath81 ) , the smaller @xmath3 is , this holds in particular for the identification of low @xmath3 coherence .",
    "that is , in particular for @xmath96 , ( as it typically is the case in excitation transport @xcite ) , the present framework can detect coherence very well even for quantum states with substantial degree of mixing ; but if necessary , one may always resort to the purity - dependent threshold values in order to improve the detection .",
    "as we have seen , an interference pattern permits to draw rigorous conclusions on coherence beyond the intuitive , qualitative expectation that an interference contrast grows with increasing coherence properties . from a practical point of view",
    ", the freedom in choice of sampling as well as the possibility to include additional information ( like purity ) makes this approach flexible , so that it can be tailored for the specific properties of a system under investigation .",
    "that is , limitations on experimentally variable quantities may be compensated through suitably chosen distributions with variable widths that reflect the realistically achievable sampling . in particular , with noisy data that does not permit to reconstruct an entire interference pattern reliably , the generalized moments of low order still can characterize coherence properties reliably .    here , we have been considering the case of @xmath20 independently adjustable phases , but the underlying framework can be generalized also for the variation of fewer phases",
    ". moreover , we developed the general framework which can utilize a wrapped version of an arbitrary probability distribution .",
    "while the normal distribution seems to be the most natural first choice , more sophisticated distributions can even better support a particular experimental realization . beyond the conceptual connection between a directly observable interference pattern and the underlying , abstract coherence properties , the present approach",
    "thus provides a versatile method to characterize coherence properties in a wide range of systems .    at the end , let us establish a general link between the generalized moments discussed in this paper and the commonly employed characterization of quantum coherence in terms of the @xmath97-norm of coherence @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "since the interference pattern ( eq .  ) satisfies @xmath99 for any value of @xmath100 , @xmath101 is bounded , @xmath102 , in terms of the moments @xmath103 .",
    "it is thus not surprising , that @xmath104 contains enough information to provide a valuable description of quantum coherence as well as practical criteria for identification of @xmath3-coherence .",
    "we thank alexander stibor and bjrn witt for interesting and helpful conversations .",
    "financial support by the european research council under the project odycquent is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "we start the derivation by inserting @xmath105 with @xmath106 given by ( [ kcohpure ] ) into the expression ( [ eq : final - expression - for - p_n ] ) : @xmath107 with @xmath108 an estimate @xmath109 applied in the second line implies that the maximum of @xmath104 with respect to @xmath110 is achieved when the peak position of the probability distribution coincides with the maximum of the interference pattern .    in the next step we employ the concept of schur - concavity @xcite .",
    "for any two vectors @xmath111 and @xmath111 such that @xmath112 is majorized by @xmath111 ( so that @xmath113 ) and any schur - concave function @xmath114 one gets @xmath115 . in the case of pure , @xmath3-coherent states all vectors",
    "@xmath111 majorize the uniform vector @xmath116 to finish the proof we thus only need to show that the function @xmath117 defined in ( [ eq : p_n_res ] ) is schur - concave for @xmath50 and @xmath51 . to this end",
    "it is sufficient to show that @xmath117 satisfies the condition @xmath118 to proceed further we need an explicit form of both functions ; that is why we define @xmath119 and @xmath120 where @xmath121 denotes the sum over all pairwise different indices @xmath122 running from @xmath123 to @xmath20 . with this , one obtains    @xmath124    and @xmath125 since all parameters @xmath126 are non - negative we can treat each term in ( [ eq : g2]-[eq : g3 ] ) separately and find ( for @xmath127 ) @xmath128    where @xmath129 denotes the sum @xmath121 with the additional exclusion of the values @xmath130 . from eq .",
    "one may see that @xmath131 ( with @xmath127 ) contains only terms proportional to @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "since all these terms are separately non - positive , @xmath135 is a sum of schur - concave functions @xmath136 , and thus schur concave .",
    "the function @xmath137 involves additional terms which are not of the form of @xmath136 and are not schur - concave .",
    "it is , however , possible to show that the terms @xmath138 @xmath139 are schur - concave for @xmath140 . for the wrapped normal distribution we get @xmath141 , so that @xmath137 is schur - concave as well .",
    "since the generalized moments ( [ eq : final - expression - for - p_n ] ) are real and non - negative we have the estimate @xmath142 since the right hand side does not depend on @xmath110 , the same upper bound applies to the maximum of @xmath143 ( maximized with respect to the center of the distribution @xmath144 ) .    the right hand side of ( [ b1 ] )",
    "explicitly reads @xmath145 and saturates if @xmath146 for all @xmath127 , so that the density matrix has only real and non - negative entries .    using the inequality of arithmetic and geometric mean we get the estimates @xmath147 @xmath148 since we assume that the purity @xmath149 is fixed we get @xmath150 what also implies that @xmath151    the maximum of ( [ identity ] ) , as well as maxima of ( [ 13 ] , [ 13 - 1 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) are provided by the uniform distribution @xmath152 this observation immediately leads to a state independent maximum of @xmath79 .",
    "the above maximum may be saturated only when the inequalities used in ( [ 13 ] , [ 13 - 1 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) saturate too , i.e. when @xmath153 the last conclusion proves eq .",
    "( [ state1 ] ) , showing that the maximum is always global .",
    "the next step is to determine when the state ( [ state1 ] ) does not happen to be @xmath9-coherent .",
    "for example , if @xmath91 , the global maximum is attained by a @xmath20-coherent pure state .",
    "we start with the following observation : to realize any @xmath3-coherent state it is sufficient to consider the form : @xmath154 with @xmath155 being for each @xmath156 a unique set of @xmath3 different indices taken from @xmath157 . by @xmath158",
    "we denote arbitrary ( not normalized ) @xmath159 positive semi - definite matrices .",
    "we shall now construct @xmath10 with all diagonal elements equal to @xmath160 and all off - diagonal elements equal to @xmath161 .",
    "the maximal value of @xmath162 is provided by the case when for every @xmath163 , all diagonal elements of @xmath158 are equal to some @xmath164 and all corresponding off - diagonal elements are given by some @xmath165 . from combinatorial considerations we find @xmath166",
