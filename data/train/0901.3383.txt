    "<S> it is widely thought that in steady , gravity - driven , unobstructed soap - film flows , the velocity increases monotonically downstream . here </S>",
    "<S> we show experimentally that the velocity increases , peaks , drops abruptly , then lessens gradually downstream . </S>",
    "<S> we argue theoretically and verify experimentally that the abrupt drop in velocity corresponds to a marangoni shock , a type of shock related to the elasticity of the film . </S>",
    "<S> marangoni shocks induce locally intense turbulent fluctuations and may help elucidate the mechanisms that produce two - dimensional turbulence away from boundaries .    </S>",
    "<S> soap - film flows @xcite have long been used to study two - dimensional ( 2-d ) turbulence , a type of turbulence that differs from its three - dimensional ( 3-d ) counterpart in crucial respects . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in 3-d turbulence the energy may cascade only from larger to smaller lengthscales whereas in 2-d turbulence the energy may cascade in either direction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> disparate directions of energy transfer result in disparate apportionings of the turbulent kinetic energy among the lengthscales of the flow @xcite . besides the theoretical interest inherent in its distinctive characteristics , </S>",
    "<S> 2-d turbulence is relevant to the large - scale irregularities encountered in 2-d atmospheric flows  flows that are confined to two dimensions by geostrophic forces and a stratified atmosphere @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . examples of large - scale irregularities in 2-d atmospheric flows include hurricanes , typhoons , and the great red spot of jupiter @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in the typical setup used to study soap - film flows @xcite , a film hangs between two long , vertical , mutually parallel wires a few centimeters apart from one another . </S>",
    "<S> driven by gravity , a steady vertical flow soon becomes established within the film ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ setup ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , the thickness @xmath0 of the film is roughly uniform on any cross section of the flow @xcite , and we write @xmath1 , where @xmath2 runs along the centerline of the flow ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ setup ] ) . in a typical flow @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> m , much smaller than both the width @xmath4 and the length @xmath5 of the flow ( fig .  [ setup ] ) . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the velocity of the flow lies on the plane of the film , and the flow is 2-d . since the viscous stresses ( and the attendant velocity gradients ) </S>",
    "<S> are confined close to the wires , the mean ( time - averaged ) velocity @xmath6 is roughly uniform on any cross section of the film @xcite , and we write @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , assuming incompressibility , @xmath8 equals the flux @xmath9 per unit width of film and is independent of @xmath2 for a steady flow .    </S>",
    "<S> analyses of steady flows have accounted for the gravitational force , the inertial force , the drag force of the ambient air , and the drag force of the wires . </S>",
    "<S> rutgers et  al .   </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have shown that the drag force of the wires is negligible as compared to the drag force of the ambient air and may be dropped from the equation of momentum balance . </S>",
    "<S> then , a prediction can be made that in a steady flow the mean velocity is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath2 and approaches a terminal velocity asymptotically downstream @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction has not been tested , but it is thought to be in qualitative agreement with the few known experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to this prediction , in our experiments @xmath10 is a strongly non - monotonic function of @xmath2 .    to measure @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> , we use laser doppler velocimetry ( ldv ) . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ velo ] we show plots of @xmath6 along the centerline of several representative flows . in each flow , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 increases downstream up to a certain point whereupon it peaks , drops abruptly to a fraction of its peak value , then continues to lessen gradually downstream .    from the incompressibility condition ( @xmath11 ) , the abrupt drop in @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> should be accompanied by an abrupt increase in @xmath0 . to verify this abrupt increase in @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> we light one face of a film with a sodium lamp and observe the interference fringes that form there . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ thick]a we show a photograph of the interference fringes on the part of a film where @xmath6 drops abruptly . </S>",
    "<S> the distance between successive fringes decreases rapidly in the downstream direction , signaling an abrupt increase in @xmath0 . to verify the abrupt increase in @xmath0 by means of an alternative technique </S>",
    "<S> , we put flourescein dye in the soapy solution and focus incoherent blue light on a spot on the film . </S>",
    "<S> the spot becomes fluorescent , and we monitor the intensity of the fluorescence using a photodetector whose counting rate is proportional to @xmath0 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ thick]b we show plots of @xmath0 along four cross sections of a flow . </S>",
    "<S> these cross sections lie on the part of the flow where @xmath6 drops abruptly . </S>",
    "<S> the thickness trebles over a short distance of a few centimeters in the downstream direction .    to explain our experimental results , we write the steady - state equation of momentum balance in the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the density , @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath15 is the surface tension , @xmath16 is the gravitational acceleration , and @xmath17 is the shear stress due to air friction . from left to right , the terms in ( [ start ] ) represent the inertial force , the elastic force , the gravitational force , and the drag force of the ambient air . here </S>",
    "<S> we follow rutgers et  al .   </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and use ( as a rough approximation ) @xmath18 , the blasius expression for the shear stress on a rigid plate that moves at a constant velocity @xmath6 through air of density @xmath19kg / m@xmath20 and viscosity @xmath21kg / ms .    to obtain an expression for @xmath22 , we argue that the concentration of soap molecules in the bulk of the film remains constant in our experiments ( because there is no time for diffusional exchange between the bulk and the faces of the film @xcite ) . then , the film is said to be in the _ marangoni regime _ , and @xmath23 @xcite , where @xmath24 is the _ marangoni speed_a property of the film , independent of @xmath0 , that quantifies the speed at which disturbances in @xmath0 travel on the plane of the film @xcite . by substituting @xmath23 and @xmath25 in ( [ start ] ) , we obtain the governing equation @xmath26    in ( [ goveq ] ) we can distinguish two types of flow : a supercritical flow in which @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and a subcritical flow in which @xmath29 and @xmath30 . we conjecture that in our experiments the flow is supercritical upstream of the drop in velocity and subcritical downstream . consistent with this conjecture , for any fixed @xmath9 the flow upstream of the drop in velocity remains invariant to changes in the length of the flow ( inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ velo ] ) .    to confirm that flows are supercritical upstream of the drop in velocity and subcritical downstream , we use pins to pierce a flow upstream and downstream of the drop in velocity ( figs .  [ thick]c and d , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> upstream of the drop in velocity the mach angle @xmath31 ( from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ thick]c ) , and the local @xmath32 m/s ( from an ldv measurement ) ; thus @xmath33m / s@xmath34 m/s in our experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> let us test the governing equation ( [ goveq ] ) for one of our experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt a value of @xmath24 and a value of @xmath9 and perform two computations . </S>",
    "<S> first , we integrate ( [ goveq ] ) downstream from @xmath35 with boundary condition @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the velocity measured at @xmath35 in the experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this first computation gives a function @xmath10 that should fit the experiment upstream of the drop in velocity . </S>",
    "<S> second , we integrate ( [ goveq ] ) upstream from @xmath38 with boundary condition @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the velocity measured at @xmath38 in the experiment @xcite . this second computation gives a function @xmath10 that should fit the experiment downstream of the drop in velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we perform the same computations for each one of our experiments trying different values of @xmath9 and @xmath24 , and choose the _ optimal values of _ @xmath9 and the _ optimal value of _ @xmath24that is to say , the values of @xmath9 ( one for each experiment ) and the value of @xmath24 ( the same for all experiments ) that yield the best fits to the experiments ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ compa ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal value of @xmath24 , @xmath41 m/s , is in remarkable agreement with our estimate from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ thick]c ( @xmath42 m/s ) . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal values of @xmath9 are in reasonable agreement with the experimental estimates for @xmath9 @xcite ( caption to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ compa ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that a drop in velocity signals a supercritical - to - subcritical transition and corresponds to a _ </S>",
    "<S> marangoni shock_. in theory the drop in velocity is infinitely steep and may be said to take place at @xmath43 , where @xmath6 attains the value of @xmath24 ( and @xmath44 becomes singular ) in the subcritical flow ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ compa ] ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but in experiments the drop in velocity takes place over a finite span @xmath45 whose magnitude appears to increase with @xmath9 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ compa ] ) and whose downstream edge is located at about @xmath43 , the theoretical position of the shock ( a position which appears to move downstream as @xmath9 increases ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus in our simple theory the shock is sharp whereas in experiments the shock is diffused over a finite span @xmath45 .    to understand the reason why our theory ( which does not account for turbulence ) can not resolve the structure of the shock , recall that a shock must dissipate energy at a steady rate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we argue ( i ) that the shock dissipates energy by powering locally intense turbulent fluctuations and ( ii ) that these fluctuations must extend roughly over the same span @xmath45 as the shock that powers them @xcite .    to test these arguments we use ldv to measure the root - mean - square velocity @xmath46 along the centerline of a representative flow ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ rms ] ) . from a comparison of figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ rms]a and b , we confirm that the shock is accompanied over its entire span @xmath45 by velocity fluctuations that are up to thrice as intense as the velocity fluctuations that prevail both upstream and dowstream of @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that intense velocity fluctuations can arise more readily where the mean velocity is higher ; this may explain why the locally intense velocity fluctuations  and the diffusive shock that powers them  are located on the supercritical side of the theoretical position of the shock .    </S>",
    "<S> to verify that the velocity fluctuations are turbulent , we obtain the energy spectrum on the centerline of the flow for three cross sections : one upstream , one within , and one downstream of the shock ( inset to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ rms]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( these cross sections are marked `` a , '' `` b , '' and `` c '' in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ rms]b . ) </S>",
    "<S> the area under the spectrum is larger for cross section b than for cross sections a and c , confirming that the turbulence is more intense within the shock than elsewhere in the flow . </S>",
    "<S> further , the slope of the spectrum at intermediate wavenumbers and the shape of the spectrum at low wavenumbers differ on either side of the shock , indicating that the spectrum undergoes structural changes as the flow traverses the shock .    </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated the spontaneous occurrence of shocks in the soap - film flows that are customarily used in experimental work on two - dimensional turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> these shocks are dissipative and diffusive ; they give rise to fluctuations independently from the boundaries , with a strong but circumscribed effect on the spatial distribution of turbulent intensity ; and they alter the structure of the turbulent spectrum downstream from the shock . we conclude that the presence of shocks should be factored in in the interpretation of experimental measurements , and submit that shocks may furnish a convenient setting to study localized turbulence production in two dimensions . </S>"
