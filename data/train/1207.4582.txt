    "in insulating solids , high frequency atomic vibrations are responsible for heat transport and thus determine the thermal properties . while the mechanisms leading to phonon damping in crystals are rather well understood , those responsible for sound attenuation in non - crystalline solids are still a matter of large interest .",
    "the main problem is that , due to the lack of periodicity , the exact nature of local and of collective vibrations is unknown .    at very low temperatures",
    ", it has been demonstrated that the dominant damping mechanism is a coupling of acoustic vibrations with tunneling units  @xcite .",
    "while the microscopic nature of those systems is not known , the phenomenological model involving resonance and relaxation of two - level tunneling systems ( tls ) explains the temperature ( @xmath0 ) and frequency ( @xmath1 ) dependence of sound velocity @xmath2 and attenuation @xmath3  @xcite . in a large @xmath0 domain above 10",
    "k the sound attenuation is dominated by a large broad peak which shifts to high @xmath0 with increasing frequency .",
    "this peak has been assigned to the coupling of acoustic vibrations with structural entities described as defects moving in asymmetric double - well potentials by thermally activated relaxation ( tar )  @xcite .",
    "this explains the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath3 observed in most sonic and ultrasonic experiments .",
    "however , the @xmath0-dependence of the sound velocity in glasses such as as@xmath4s@xmath5 and as@xmath4se@xmath5  @xcite can not be explained by this model : the behavior observed there is very similar to the decrease of sound velocity in crystals , where it is assigned to relaxation of thermal phonons by anharmonic interactions  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that , even if the nature of thermal modes in glasses is unknown , and certainly different from propagating plane - wave phonons , a similar anharmonic mechanism can be present  @xcite .",
    "in fact , we have observed that brillouin scattering measurements of @xmath3 in vitreous silica at frequencies in the hypersonic range can not be described satisfactorily by the tar mechanism alone  @xcite .",
    "the excess to the tar contribution was assigned to anharmonicity .",
    "the measurements were extended to frequencies up to 400  ghz  @xcite .",
    "the results are well described by the sum of the contributions of the three above mechanisms , tls , tar and anharmonicity . due to the different @xmath0 and @xmath1 dependence of those mechanisms",
    ", anharmonicity tends to dominate above 100  ghz . in vitreous silica , @xmath2-sio@xmath4 ,",
    "we have performed a simultaneous fit of measurements of @xmath3 and @xmath2 at low @xmath0 in a large frequency domain , which allowed to extract the parameters of the models . calculating the velocity dispersion up to high @xmath0 and subtracting the contributions",
    "given by tar and anharmonicity from the experimental results , one expects to get a constant bare velocity .",
    "in fact , we observed that the bare velocity shows an almost linear increase above 100  k. this was explained by a temperature dependent microscopic structural change leading to @xmath0-hardening  @xcite .",
    "a well - known characteristic of glasses is the plateau observed in the thermal conductivity in the 5 - 10  k range  @xcite .",
    "this plateau suggests that a strong damping mechanism limits the mean free path of the acoustic waves responsible for thermal transfer  @xcite . in this temperature range ,",
    "the frequency of dominating thermal acoustic waves is around 1  thz  @xcite .",
    "a mechanism leading to this strong damping must be invoked in addition to those discussed above .",
    "using brillouin scattering of x - rays to investigate acoustic waves in the thz range , we have given evidence for an attenuation increasing as @xmath6 in two glasses leading to a ioffe - regel crossover  @xcite .",
    "above the frequency of this crossover , plane acoustic waves can no longer propagate  @xcite .",
    "the association of the mechanisms discussed above gives a satisfactory description of most of the @xmath3 and @xmath2 measurements in vitreous silica .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to extend this description to vitreous germanium oxide ( @xmath2-geo@xmath4 ) , another tetrahedrally coordinated glass .",
