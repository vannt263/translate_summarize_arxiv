    "the irac bands , on the other hand , correctly place the extreme candidates at the brightest end of sequence 1 , the fundamental mode pulsators .",
    "the 24  @xmath7 m  band is sensitive to emission from cool dusty envelopes .",
    "the observed flux from the sources surrounded by the most optically thick dust shells is dominated by the emission from their outermost , coolest layers .",

    "the 24  @xmath7 m  flux is therefore not representative of the intrinsic brightness of these sources .",
    "this poor estimate for intrinsic brightness causes the sequence structure to break down entirely .",
    "using the method of weighted least - squares , linear models of the form @xmath35[eq : pl ] were fit to each of the sequences as a whole , and to each subgroup ( o - rich , etc . ) within each sequence .",
    "periods and amplitudes are from the dominant mode of variability derived by @xcite from macho blue - band lightcurves .",
    "periods were considered free of errors , and because the sage observations are not phase corrected , magnitudes were weighted by the inverse of the quadrature sum of the 1-@xmath36 photometric error and one - half the macho peak - to - peak variability amplitude .",
    "table  [ tab : fit ] lists the linear fit parameters thus determined for each of the 6 sequences , using the irac [ 3.6 ] magnitude as the luminosity proxy .",
    "previous work has indicated that mira variables exhibit much lower amplitude variation in the ir than in the optical ( lattanzio & wood ( 2003 ) , in : * ? ? ? * ) , and thus using one - half of the macho amplitude in the error term might overestimate the true scatter in the data due to intrinsic variation . to investigate this , we extracted a sample of @xmath0100 sources from the catalog of @xcite with well - determined macho periods between 150 and 200 days . at these periods",
    ", the three month cadence of the sage observations could sample these stars anywhere between maximum and minimum brightness .",
    "thus the range of variation in brightness between epoch 1 and 2 observations could represent the full mid - ir peak to peak amplitude of variation .",
    "the macho amplitudes for the o - rich and c - rich agb candidates are statistically very similar to the variation seen in this smaller sample .",
    "the small sample from @xcite has a median mid - ir variation of @xmath00.2  mag between sage epoch 1 and epoch 2 .",
    "the median optical amplitudes for all o - rich and c - rich sources together are 0.2 and 0.3 magnitudes respectively .",
    "in addition , we compared the distribution of the macho variability amplitudes to the distribution of the residual scatter ( table  [ tab : fit ] ) about the p - l fits .",
    "the residual scatter of @xmath00.5 magnitude about the best fit line ( see table  [ tab : fit ] ) is due to the intrinsic variability of the sources .",
    "the sage mosaic photometry is constructed from the two epochs of the sage survey , but lacks the time - stamp information necessary for the phase - correction necessary to compute a true mean magnitude for these variable sources .",
    "some of our sources have been observed near maximum brightness , while other were near their minimum brightness .",
    "the residual scatter about the p - l relations gives us an indication of the scale of the ir variability of our sample .",
    "both quantities followed similar distributions , and were of the same scale .",
    "this justifies our use of the macho optical variability amplitude as a measure of the ir variability of our sources for the estimation of the uncertainty in the ir mean magnitudes in the p - l relations .",

    " cores \" visible to the eye .",
    "this emphasis sacrifices some sample size , but we note that the scatter in our p - l relations ( of order @xmath00.15  mag ) is dominated by the intrinsic variability of the sources and would not be significantly reduced by introducing more sources by using the secondary periods to assign the un - sequenced sources to one of the existing p - l sequences .",
    "we note that ultimately , our p - l sequence definitions are a judgment call , and slightly different definitons used by other authors are equally valid and can affect the measured p - l fits .",
    "in particular , the trgb cut at a constant @xmath37 leads to a sharp parallelogram shape at the brightest end of the rgb population .",
    "these corners cause the rgb and o - rich agb p - l fits to be less steep than the fit to all the stars in a sequence , regardless of class , which is not affected by this selection bias ( table  [ tab : fit ] ) .    beginning with these definitions of the p - l sequences , careful study of the panels of figure  [ fig:4band ]",
