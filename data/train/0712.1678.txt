    "in this brief report the dynamics of a chain fluctuating in some medium at fixed temperature @xmath1 is discussed .",
    "the three dimensional case is particularly interesting , because it allows to study the topological entanglement of two or more chains .",
    "the problem of the topological entanglement of two chains has been investigated for a long time in the statistical mechanics of polymers , see for instance ref .   and references therein .",
    "if the topological constraints which limit the fluctuations of the chains are described by using the gauss linking number , the probability distribution of the system turns out to be equivalent to the partition function of a zero - component landau  ginzburg model interacting with a pair of chern  simons fields . the analogous problem in polymer dynamics",
    "has not yet been solved . here",
    "we show that the probability function of the system of two chains in the presence of topological constraints may be simplified thanks to the introduction of a chern ",
    "simons field theory also in the case of dynamics .",
    "finally , we provide a formula for the probability function of a chain which can form only discrete angles with respect to the @xmath0axis .",
    "we would like to treat the dynamics of a chain fluctuating in some medium at constant temperature @xmath1 . in ref .",
    "( see also ref .  )",
    "the case of a two dimensional chain has been discussed .",
    "the approach presented in those references can however be extended to any dimension .",
    "let us consider the probability function @xmath2 which measures the probability that a @xmath3dimensional continuous chain starting from a given spatial configuration @xmath4 arrives after a time @xmath5 to a final configuration @xmath6 .",
    "the chain is regarded as the continuous limit of a discrete chain consisting of particles connected together with segments of fixed length . in the continuous limit",
    ", the constraints arising due to the presence of the segments take the form : @xmath7 .",
    "then , an expression of @xmath2 in terms of path integrals may be written as follows : @xmath8 & = & \\int_{\\mathbf r(t_f , s)= \\mathbf r_f(s)\\atop \\mathbf r(t_i , s)= \\mathbf r_i(s ) } { \\cal d}\\mathbf r{\\cal d}\\lambda\\exp\\left\\ { -c{\\textstyle \\int_{t_i}^{t_f}dt\\int_0^lds\\dot{\\mathbf    r}^2 } \\right\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\exp{\\textstyle\\left\\{i\\int_{t_i}^{t_f}dt\\int_0^lds\\lambda\\left ( { \\textstyle\\left| \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf r}{\\partial s }   \\right|^2 - 1 } \\right)\\right\\ } } \\label{contparttd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the fields @xmath9 represent @xmath3dimensional vectors .",
    "moreover @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the total mass of the chain , @xmath12 is its length and @xmath13 denotes the boltzmann constant .",
    "finally , the relaxation time @xmath14 characterizes the rate of the decay of the drift velocity of the particles composing the chain . in eq .",
    "( [ contparttd ] ) the lagrange multiplier @xmath15 has been introduced in order to impose the constraints using the fourier representation of the @xmath16function @xmath17 .",
    "the model described by eq .",
    "( [ contparttd ] ) will be called here the generalized nonlinear sigma model ( gnlsm ) due to its close resemblance to a two - dimensional nonlinear sigma model .",
    "let us note that the holonomic constraint @xmath18 of the nonlinear sigma model has been replaced here by a nonholonomic constraint .    in the following , we will restrict ourselves to the physically relevant case @xmath19 .",
    "the three dimensional case is particularly interesting because it allows the introduction of topological relations . to this purpose ,",
    "let us imagine two closed chains @xmath20 and @xmath21 of lengths @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "the trajectories of the two chains are described by the two vectors @xmath24 and @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 . the simplest way to impose topological constraints on two closed trajectories",
    "is to use the gauss linking number @xmath28 : @xmath29 .",
    "if the trajectories of the chains were impenetrable , then @xmath28 would not depend on time , since it is not possible to change the topological configuration of a system of knots if their trajectories are not allowed to cross themselves .",
    "however , since we are not going to introduce interactions between the two chains , we just require that , during the time @xmath5 , the average value of the gauss linking number is an arbitrary constant @xmath30 , i.  e. @xmath31 .",
    "it is possible to show that the probability function of two chains whose trajectories satisfy the above topological constraint is given by : @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34}\\quad i=1,2\\ ] ] @xmath35 @xmath36",
    "to conclude , we would like to mention the interesting case in which the chain is forced to form with the @xmath0axis only the two fixed angles @xmath37 and @xmath38@xcite . if there are no interactions depending on the @xmath39 degree of freedom , it turns out that this problem can be reduced to a two dimensional one .",
    "since in this work interactions are not considered , the probability function of the chain may be written as follows : @xmath40 where @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "in this work the dynamics of a @xmath3dimensional chain has been investigated .",
    "the probability function @xmath2 of this system is equivalent to the partition function of a generalized nonlinear sigma model .",
    "next , the fluctuations of two topologically entangled chains have been discussed .",
    "analogously to what happens in the case of statistical mechanics@xcite , the complexities connected with the handling of the gauss linking number may be partly eliminated with the introduction of chern - simons fields , which decouple the interactions of topological origin between the chains @xcite .",
    "still , one has to perform a path integration over the trajectories of each chain separately . in statistical mechanics , this is equivalent to compute the path integral of a particle immersed in a magnetic field . in dynamics ,",
    "the particle is replaced by a two dimensional field @xmath9 .",
    "to evaluate such path integral is a complicated task .",
    "finally , the problem of a three dimensional chain admitting only fixed angles with respect to the @xmath0axis is reduced to the problem of a two dimensional chain , in a way which is similar to the reduction of the statistical mechanics of a directed polymer to the random walk of a two dimensional particle .",
