    "we discuss observation and reduction techniques which may prove important to other coronagraphic programs .",
    "we then present the measured and inferred properties from hst / nicmos and keck / lris & nirc observations of the newly discovered companion .",

    "we obtained two multiple - exposure images with the bright primary star twa 5 behind the coronagraph ( radius = 0.3  arc  sec ) at two orientations differing by 29.9 degrees .",
    "while the stellar point - spread - function ( psf ) , the instrumental scattering function , and detector artifacts rotate with the aperture , any real features in the unocculted area of the detector will be unaffected by a change in the camera orientation .",
    "subtraction of these two images has been shown to further reduce residual psf background light ( schneider et al .",

    "step64 multiaccum ( non - destructive read ) integrations ( mackenty et al .",
    "1997 ) totaling 684 s were executed at each orientation .",
    "the nicmos coronagraphic images were reduced and processed utilizing calibration darks and flat - fields created by the nicmos instrument design team ( idt ) from on - orbit observations .",
    "the raw image data were calibrated in an analog to the pipeline reduction software , calnica ( bushouse 1997 ) , which performs a dark subtraction , fits the multiaccum data using linear regression , and flat - fields the images .",
    "no explicit background correction was made at this step because the differencing of the two coronagraphic images removed scattered light and any background light .",
    "two additional steps were performed before flat - fielding ; one process which used the first reads in the multiaccum sets to estimate the signals in pixels which saturated in later reads , and another which removed an estimate of the residual dc offsets left after subtracting the dark current .",
    "following initial calibration , bad pixel values were replaced by a weighted interpolation with a radius of 5 pixels .",
    "the three multiaccums at each orientation were then averaged to create final calibrated images .",
    "the images from each of the two spacecraft orientations were then aligned and subtracted from each other leaving lower amplitude residual noise near the coronagraphic hole edge , as well as positive and negative conjugates of any objects in the field of view .",
    "the raw data were reduced independently in a similar manner using the nicred program ( mcleod 1997 ) .",

    "the secondary is also seen in the lris ( figure 1b ) and nirc ( not shown ) direct images at the same position angle and separation .",
    "the positions of the primary and secondary in the nicmos images were found by a least - squares isophotal ellipse fitting process around the psf core with a radius of 7 pixels to exclude flux from any close objects .",
    "since the target star is occulted in the nicmos coronagraphic images , its position is ascertained from the target acquisition image , which resulted in independent measurements of each offset and position from both orientations .      in order to measure the flux of the secondary in the nicmos images ,",
    "the image conjugates ( positive and negative ) were separated after subtraction , then shifted ( translated , not rotated ) with bi - cubic interpolation / resampling to null - out / align the psf of the companion .",
    "the positive and negative images were combined to produce a reconstructed image of the companion with the background suppressed except for residual photon noise ( figure 1a ) .",

    "the h - band magnitude of twa 5a was determined from aperture photometry of the two calibrated target acquisition images ( at each of the two spacecraft orientations ) processed as described in section 2.1 . both measurements overlapped within the uncertainties and",
    "were averaged to yield h @xmath0 7.2 @xmath21 0.1 mag ( table 1 ) .",

    "was used to minimize the influence of spillover light from the primary . the flux measured in the aperture",
    "was corrected relative to an 8 pixel ( 1.@xmath202 ) radius aperture using bright objects in the lris field of view . comparing the measured signal with a white dwarf , hz4 , whose i=14.7 mag ( zuckerman & becklin 1987 )",

    "the majority of the uncertainty in the measure lies in the aperture correction due to the proximity of the saturated primary .    as in the lris images ,",
    "the primary is also saturated in the nirc direct images , but circular aperture photometry was performed on the secondary using small apertures to decrease the influence of light from the primary . the measured j and k magnitudes of twa 5b ( table 1 ) harbor systematic uncertainties resulting from poorly calibrated curves of growth of both the object and standard stars .",

    "hence the a priori probability of finding an object of this brightness within a 2@xmath20 radius circle ( area = 0.0035 sq .",

    "most of those red objects were likely background galaxies which would be resolved by hst .",
    "therefore , we estimate the probability that a red background star is separated from twa 5a by 2 arcsec is the product of these two , or @xmath26 2 @xmath28 .",
    "we consider the possibility that twa 5b could be a foreground , low - mass star . assuming",
    "a spectral type later than m7 from the colors , we find m@xmath29 @xmath27 10.15 for a dwarf star ( kirkpatrick & mccarthy 1994 ) , so the photometric distance would be 25 parsecs .",

    "assuming a spherical distribution of low mass stars in the solar neighborhood , we should expect 750 such objects out to 25 parsecs , so the a priori probability of finding one in projection within a 2@xmath20 radius circle is 2 @xmath30 .",
    "given these small probabilities , it is unlikely we would find a foreground or background object of this nature in our sample size of less than 50 stars .",
    "the combination of a small separation from another low - mass star , an extremely red color , and moderate brightness is rare at a galactic latitude of 25 degrees .",
    "further , as shown below , twa 5b falls on the same isochrone as twa 5a on the h - r diagram , implying coevality , and therefore companionship . for the remainder of the paper , we assume twa 5b is physically associated with twa 5a .",

    "simons et al ( 1996 ) present a derived relation between color and effective temperature which gives 2538k for the j@xmath2k color we measure . since many young",
    ", low - mass stars possess spectral features indicative of both dwarfs and giants ( luhman & rieke 1998 ) , it has been argued that adopting an intermediate effective temperature for the two luminosity classes , 100@xmath8k to 150@xmath8k hotter than the dwarf scale , is appropriate ( luhman et al 1997 ; white et al 1998 ) .",
