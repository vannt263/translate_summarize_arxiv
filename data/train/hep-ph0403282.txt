    "rare @xmath1 meson decays , induced by flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xmath2 transitions provide a promising ground for testing the structure of weak interactions .",
    "these decays which are forbidden in the standard model ( sm ) at tree level , occur at loop level and are very sensitive to the gauge structure of the sm",
    ". moreover , these decays are also quite sensitive to the existence of new physics beyond the sm , since loops with new particles can give considerable contribution to rare decays .",
    "the new physics effects in rare decays can appear in two ways ; one via modification of the existing wilson coefficients in the sm , or through the introduction of some operators with new coefficients .",
    "theoretical investigation of the @xmath3 decays are relatively more clean compared to their exclusive counterparts , since they are not spoiled by nonperturbative long distance effects , while the corresponding exclusive channels are easier to measure experimentally .",
    "some of the most important exclusive fcnc decays are @xmath4 and @xmath5 decays .",
    "the latter provides potentially a very rich set of experimental observables , such as , lepton pair forward ",
    "backward ( fb ) asymmetry , lepton polarizations , etc .",
    "various kinematical distributions of such processes as @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite have already been studied .",
    "experimentally measurable quantities such as forward  backward asymmetry , single polarization asymmetry , etc . , have been studied for the @xmath10 decay in @xcite .",
    "study of these quantities can give useful information in fitting the parameters of the sm and put constraints on new physics @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out in @xcite that the study of simultaneous polarizations of both leptons in the final state provide , in principle , measurement of many more observables which would be useful in further improvement of the parameters of the sm probing new physics beyond the sm .",
    "it should be noted here that both lepton polarizations in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 decays are studied in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "as has already been noted , one efficient way of establishing new physics effects is studying forward ",
    "backward asymmetry in semileptonic @xmath0 decay , since , @xmath13 vanishes at specific values of the dilepton invariant mass , and more essential than that , this zero position of @xmath13 is known to be practically free of hadronic uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is studying the polarized forward  backward asymmetry in the exclusive @xmath10 decay using a general form of the effective hamiltonian , including all possible forms of interactions .",
    "here we would like to remind the reader that the influence of new wilson coefficients on various kinematical variables , such as branching ratios , lepton pair forward ",
    "backward asymmetries and single lepton polarization asymmetries for the inclusive @xmath14 decays ( see first references in @xcite ) and exclusive @xmath15 @xcite and pure leptonic @xmath16 decays @xcite have been studied comprehensively .",
    "recently , exiting results have been announced by the babar and belle collaborations for experimental study of the @xmath17 decay .",
    "as far as the results for the branching ratio of the @xmath10 decay measured by these collaborations are gives as ( b k^^+ ^- ) = \\ {    lc ( 11.5^+2.6_-2.4 0.8 0.2 ) 10 ^ -7 & @xcite  , +   + ( 0.88^+0.33_-0.29 ) 10 ^ -6 & @xcite  .    .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , using a general form of the effective hamiltonian , we obtain the matrix element in terms of the form factors of the @xmath18 transition . in section 3",
    "we derive the analytical results for the polarized forward  backward asymmetry .",
    "last section is devoted to the numerical analysis , discussion and conclusions .",
    "in this section we present the matrix element for the @xmath10 decay using a general form of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the @xmath10 process is governed by @xmath19 transition at quark level .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath19 can be written in terms of the twelve model independent four  fermi interactions in the following form : [ e6301 ] h_eff v_tsv_tb^\\ { c_sl |s i _ l b |^+ c_br |s i _ r b |^ + c_ll^tot |s_l _ b_l |_l ^_l + c_lr^tot |s_l _ b_l |_r ^_r + c_rl |s_r _ b_r    c_rr |s_r _ b_r |_r ^_r + c_lrlr |s_l b_r |_l _ r + c_rllr |s_r b_l |_l _ r + c_lrrl |s_l b_r |_r _",
    "l + c_rlrl |s_r b_l |_r _",
    "l+ c_t |s _ b |^ + i c_te^ |s _ b | _ }  , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 in ( [ e6301 ] ) are defined as l =  ,   r =  , and @xmath22 are the coefficients of the four  fermi interactions . here , few words about the above hamiltonian are in order . in principle ,",
    "@xmath23 , being a member of the standard model operators , as well as operators of the type @xmath24 , where @xmath25 represents a quark field , give contributions to the @xmath19 transition at one  loop level .",
    "the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ e6301 ] ) should be understood as an effective version of the most general one , where the above  mentioned contributions are absorbed into effective wilson coefficients which depend on @xmath26 in general .",
    "the first two coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ e6301 ] ) , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are the nonlocal fermi interactions , which correspond to @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the sm , respectively .",
    "the following four terms with coefficients @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the vector type interactions .",
    "two of these interactions containing @xmath35 and @xmath36 do already exist in the sm in the form @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "hence , representing @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the form c_ll^tot & = & c_9^eff - c_10 + c_ll  , + c_lr^tot & = & c_9^eff + c_10 + c_lr  , allows us to conclude that @xmath35 and @xmath36 describe the sum of the contributions from sm and the new physics .",
    "the terms with coefficients @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 describe the scalar type interactions .",
    "the remaining last two terms lead by the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 , obviously , describe the tensor type interactions .",
    "the exclusive @xmath10 decay is described in terms of the matrix elements of the quark operators in eq .",
    "( [ e6301 ] ) over meson states , which can be parametrized in terms of the form factors . obviously , the following matrix elements & & k^|s _ ( 1 _ 5 ) b b  , + & & k^|s i _ q^ ( 1 _ 5 ) b b  , + & & k^|s ( 1 _ 5 ) b b  , + & & k^|s _ b b  , are needed for the calculation of the @xmath10 decay .",
    "these matrix elements are defined as follows : + & & - _ ^ p_k^^q^ i _",

    "in order to ensure finiteness of ( [ e6302 ] ) at @xmath48 , we assume that @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the matrix element @xmath51 can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ e6302 ] ) by contracting both sides of eq .",
    "( [ e6302 ] ) with @xmath52 and using equation of motion . neglecting the mass of the strange quark we get [ e6305 ] k^(p_k^ , ) |s ( 1 _ 5 ) b b(p_b ) =  . in deriving eq .",
    "( [ e6305 ] ) we have used the relationship 2 m_k^ a_3(q^2 ) = ( m_b+m_k^ ) a_1(q^2 ) - ( m_b - m_k^ ) a_2(q^2 )  , which follows from the equations of motion .    using the definition of the form factors ,",
    "as given above , the amplitude of the @xmath10 decay can be written as + & & \\ { |^(1-_5 ) + & & + |^(1+_5 ) + & & + |(1-_5 ) + |(1+_5 ) + & & + 4 |^ ( i c_t _ ) + & & + 16 c_te | _  , +   + [ e6317 ] a_fb^lt m_b^2  , +   + [ e6318 ] a_fb^tl m_b^2 +   + [ e6319 ] a_fb^nt m_b^2  , +   + [ e6320 ] a_fb^tn m_b^2  , +   + [ e6321 ] a_fb^nn m_b^3 v  , +   + [ e6322 ] a_fb^tt m_b^3 v  . in these expressions for @xmath53 , the first index in the superscript describes the polarization of lepton and the second index describes that of anti  lepton .",
    "it should be noted here that , the double  polarized @xmath54 asymmetry for the @xmath55 and @xmath56 decays are calculated in the supersymmetric model in @xcite .",
    "in this section we analyze the effects of the wilson coefficients on the polarized @xmath54 asymmetry .",
    "the input parameters we use in our numerical calculations are : @xmath57 and @xmath58 . for the values of the wilson",
    "coefficients we use @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "it should be noted that the above  presented value for @xmath61 corresponds only to short distance contributions .",
    "in addition to the short distance contributions , it receives long distance contributions which result from the conversion of @xmath62 to the lepton pair . in this work",
    "we neglect long distance contributions .",
    "the reason for such a choice is dictated by the fact that , in the sm the zero position of @xmath13 for the @xmath10 decay is practically independent of the form factors and is determined in terms of short distance wilson coefficients @xmath61 and @xmath63 ( see @xcite ) and @xmath64 . for the form factors we have used the light cone qcd sum rules results @xcite . as a result of the analysis carried out in this scheme , the @xmath26 dependence of the form factors can be represented in terms of three parameters as f(q^2 ) =  , where the values of parameters @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 for the @xmath18 decay are listed in table 1 .",
    "@xmath68    the new wilson coefficients vary in the range @xmath69 .",
    "the experimental value of the branching ratio of the @xmath70 decay @xcite and the bound on the branching ratio of the @xmath71 @xcite suggest that this is the right order of magnitude for the vector and scalar interaction coefficients .",
    "it should be noted here that the experimental results lead to stronger restrictions on some of the wilson coefficients , namely @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , while the remaining coefficients vary in the range @xmath76 .",
    "since all existing experimental results are yet preliminary , we will vary all new wilson coefficients in the range @xmath76 .    in fig .",
    "1(2 ) we present the dependence of the @xmath77 on @xmath26 for the @xmath78 at four fixed values of @xmath79 . from these figures",
    "we see that nonzero values of the new wilson coefficients shift the zero position of @xmath77 corresponding to the sm result . when @xmath31 gets negative ( positive ) values , the zero position of @xmath77 shifts to the left ( right ) in comparison to that of the zero position in the sm .",
    "our analysis shows that the zero position of @xmath77 for the @xmath78 decay is practically independent of the existence of other wilson coefficients .",
    "for this reason we do not present the dependence of @xmath77 on @xmath26 at fixed values of the remaining wilson coefficients .    figs .",
    "3(5 ) and 4(6 ) depict the dependence of @xmath80 and @xmath81 on @xmath26 at four fixed values of @xmath82 .",
    "we observe from these figures that the zero positions of @xmath80 and @xmath81 are very sensitive to the existence of tensor interactions .",
    "more essential than is that in the sm case @xmath80 and @xmath81 do not have zero values .",
    "therefore , if zero values for the polarized @xmath80 and @xmath81 asymmetries are measured in the experiments in future , these results are unambiguous indication of the existence of new physics beyond the sm , more specifically , the existence of tensor interactions .    in the case of @xmath83 decay ,",
    "the zero position for the double polarization asymmetries @xmath53 is absent for most of the new wilson coefficients , and hence , it could be concluded to be insensitive to the new physics beyond the sm , or the value of @xmath53 is quite small , whose measurement in the experiments could practically be impossible .",
    "for this reason we do not present the dependencies of @xmath53 on @xmath26 at fixed values of @xmath22 for the @xmath83 decay .    as is obvious from the explicit expressions of the forward  backward asymmetries , they depend both on @xmath26 and the new wilson coefficients @xmath22 . as a result of this , it might be difficult to study the dependence of the polarized forward ",
    "backward asymmetries @xmath53 on these parameters .",
    "however , we can eliminate the dependence of the polarized @xmath53 on @xmath26 by performing integration over @xmath26 in the kinematically allowed region , so that the polarized forward ",
    "backward asymmetry is said to be averaged .",
    "the averaged polarized forward ",
    "backward asymmetry is defined as _ fb^ij =  .    in fig .",
    "( 7 ) , we present the dependence of @xmath84 on @xmath22 for the @xmath78 decay .",
    "the common intersection point of all curves corresponds to the sm case .",
    "we observe from this figure that , @xmath84 has symmetric behavior on its dependence on @xmath43 and @xmath44 with respect to zero position , and remains smaller compared to the sm result .",
    "the only case for which @xmath85 occurs for the positive values of the vector interaction coefficients .",
    "therefore , if we measure in the experiments @xmath86 , it is a direct indication of new physics beyond the sm , and this departure is to be attributed solely to the existence of vector type interactions .",
    "the situation is even more conformative for the @xmath83 case . in figs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , we present the dependencies of @xmath84 and @xmath87 on the new wilson coefficients @xmath22 . from fig .",
    "( 9 ) we observe that , with respect to the zero value of the wilson coefficients , @xmath84 increases if @xmath88 and @xmath34 increase , while it decreases when @xmath40 increases .    from fig .",
    "( 9 ) we see that the dependence of @xmath87 on the tensor interaction is stronger .",
    "when @xmath89 and @xmath32 are negative ( positive ) and vary from @xmath90 to zero ( from zero to @xmath91 ) @xmath87 decrease ( increase ) . additionally , we observe that with increasing values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath87 increases .",
    "this figure further depicts that @xmath87 , for practical purposes , is not sensitive to the existence of scalar interactions . on the other hand , @xmath92 and",
    "@xmath93 are very sensitive to the presence of tensor and scalar interactions ( see figs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 11 ) ) .",
    "it is clear from these results that several of the polarized forward ",
    "backward asymmetries show sizable departure from the sm results and they are sensitive to the existence of different type of interactions",
    ". therefore , study of these observables can be very useful in looking for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "obviously , if new physics beyond the sm exists , there hoped to be effects on the branching ratio besides the polarized @xmath13 . keeping in mind that the measurement of the branching ratio is easier",
    ", one could find it more convenient to study it for establishing new physics .",
    "but the intriguing question is , whether there could appear situations in which the value of the branching ratio coincides with that of the sm result , while polarized @xmath13 does not . in order to answer this question we study the correlation between the averaged , polarized @xmath94 and branching ratio . in further analysis",
    "we vary the branching ratio of @xmath95 between the values @xmath96 $ ] , which is very close to the sm calculations .",
    "note that , we do not take into account the experimental results on branching ratio since they contain large errors , and it would be better to wait for more improved experimental results .",
    "our conclusion for the @xmath97 decay , in regard to the above  mentioned correlated relation , is as follows ( remember that , the intersection of all curves corresponds to the sm value ) :    * for @xmath84 , such a region is absent for all @xmath22 , * for @xmath98 , such a region does exist for @xmath99 and @xmath44 ( see fig . ( 13 ) ) .",
    "the situation is much more attractive for the @xmath100 decay . in figs .",
    "( 14)(18 ) , we depict the dependence of the averaged , forward  backward polarized asymmetries @xmath84 ; @xmath101 ; @xmath102 ; @xmath92 and @xmath93 , on branching ratio .",
    "it follows from these figures that , indeed , there exist certain regions of the new wilson coefficients for which , mere study of the polarized @xmath13 can give promising information about new physics beyond the sm .    in summary , in this work we present the analysis for the forward  backward asymmetries when both leptons are polarized , using a general , model independent form of the effective hamiltonian . our work verifies that the study of the zero position of @xmath84 can give unambiguous conformation of the new physics beyond the sm , since when",
    "new physics effects are taken into account , the results are shifted with respect to their zero positions in the sm .",
    "moreover , we find that the polarized @xmath13 is quite sensitive to the existence of the tensor and vector interactions .",
    "finally we obtain that there exist certain regions of the new wilson coefficients for which , only study of the polarized forward ",
    "backward asymmetry gives invaluable information in establishing new physics beyond the sm .",
