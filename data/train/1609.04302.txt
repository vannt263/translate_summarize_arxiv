    "brownian motion with purely time dependent drift and diffusion are ubiquitous in geophysical , environmental and biophysical processes .",
    "one can identify numerous geophysical and environmental processes which occur under the crucial effect of external time dependent and random forcing , e.g. , the change between the snow - storage and snow - melt phases @xcite , outbreak of water - borne diseases @xcite , the life cycle of tidal communities @xcite , and many more .",
    "stochastic models with time dependent drift and diffusion terms are extensively used in the study of neuroscience @xcite .",
    "one of the most useful tool to tackle such stochastic processes is the fokker- planck formalism @xcite . in this formalism ,",
    "different realizations of a system are narrated in terms of probability density which denotes the system in a given state at a certain instant and the theoretical description of such 1-d diffusion motion is governed by : @xmath7 in this respect several interesting questions of wide inter- est can be raised such as , ( i)the probability of finding the system in a certain domain at a certain instant ( survival probability ) , ( ii)the pdf of time @xmath1 at which the system exit a certain domain first time ( known as first passage time @xmath2 ) starting from initial point @xmath0 , ( iii)the pdf @xmath4 of the maximum value of a bm process be- fore of its first passage time , and ( iv)the joint probability distribution @xmath8 of the maximum value m and its occurrence time @xmath6 before the first passage time of the bm process . +",
    "all the above mentioned pdfs are calculated and discussed for simple wiener and ornstein - uhlenbeck processes @xcite as well as in the context of dna breathing dynamics @xcite .",
    "but , all these discussions are based on constant drift and diffusion terms .",
    "however , the extension to a time dependent drift and time dependent diffusion terms are not straightforward .",
    "this is mainly because of the fact that the system has broken both the space and time homogeneity .",
    "several attempts are made to study bm process with purely time dependent drift and diffusion terms .",
    "one of the main work on bm with time dependent drift is barrierless electronic reactions in solutions @xcite . generalizing the oster - nishijima model @xcite to the low viscosity limit or the inertial limit ,",
    "the authors observed a strong dependence on friction and temperature of the decay rate even in the absence of the barrier , which agrees well with numerical simulation of the full lanevin equation @xcite .",
    "a series of works on stochastic resonance for time dependent sinusoidal drift is analyzed in refs . @xcite .",
    "the first passage time statistics for a wiener process with an exponential time dependent drift term are analyzed in the context of neu- ron dynamics in refs . @xcite .",
    "also , recent studies of dna unzipping under periodic forcing need to be mentioned @xcite .",
    "recently , molini _ et . al _ @xcite make a study on bm with purely time dependent drift and diffusion terms .",
    "+ in this work , we extend above mentioned works @xcite by incorporating several pdfs of brownian motion i.e. @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 for a bm with purely time dependent drift and diffusion terms .",
    "one of the main objective of this work is to incorporate inertial effect in brownian functional study and to our best of knowledge , it is the first attempt to incorporate inertial effect in first passage study which is one of the impor- tant unsolved problem .",
    "the other objective of this work is to advertise for the use of the recently studied backward fokker - planck ( bfp ) method @xcite and the path decomposition ( pd ) method @xcite .",
    "both the bfp and pd methods are based on the feynman - kac formalism @xcite and both of them are first time used for exploring bm process with purely time dependent drift and diffusion terms . both the techniques are extensively used in study- ing many aspects of classical brownian motion , as well as for exploring different problems in computer science and astronomy @xcite . for the first time , we consider these elegant methods to study the brownian functionals for a bm with purely time dependent drift and diffu- sion . unlike the standard fp treatment @xcite",
    "which yields distribution functions directly , we derive and solve differential equations for the laplace transforms of var- ious brownian functionals in the bfp method . on the other hand",
    ", we can utilize the pd method to calculate the distribution functions of interest by splitting a rep- resentative path of the dynamics into parts with their appropriate weighage of each part separately .",
    "this fact is justifiable by considering the markovian property of the dynamics . + the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we dis- cuss our bm process model with purely time dependent drift and diffusion terms .",
    "then we discuss several dis- tribution functions of interest and their relevances .",
    "the bfp and pd methods are explained in short . in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce several pdfs for a bm with power law time dependent drift and diffusion terms .",
    "we illustrate the example of fresh water availability in summer in the snowmelt dominated regime with the power law time dependent drift and diffusion terms .",
    "we conclude our paper in section iv .",
    "we are interested with those kind of problem where time - dependent random forcing is predominant . hence , the fokker - planck description of such problem can be made through eq .",
    "the associated stochastic differential equation for the state variable x(t ) is given by : @xmath9 where , @xmath10 is the purely time dependent drift term , @xmath11 denotes the diffusion term , and @xmath12 is a wiener process with gaussian distribution .",
    "the wiener process is an idealized statistical descriptions that apply to many physical systems @xcite .",
    "one of the most elegant theoretical method to tackle such kind of stochastic processes is the fokker - planck ( fp ) formalism @xcite . in this formalism",
    ", one can describe different realizations of a system by the probability density .",
    "one can find the system in a given state at a certain time , and the corresponding diffusion equation describes its temporal evolution .",
    "several interesting questions related to such stochastic systems are of wide interest in several areas @xcite .",
    "one of the main interest in this field is to find the probability density for the system remains in a certain domain at a given instant and the moment at which the system escapes it for the first time .",
    "due to the stochastic nature of the system , different realizations of the system leave a certain domain at different times and it is natural to consider the statistical properties of this random variable .",
    "other interesting questions related with such first passage statistics are ( i ) finding the probability density @xmath3 of area under a path ( ii ) probability density @xmath4 of maximum size and ( iii ) the joint probability density @xmath13 of maximum size and its occurrence time @xmath6 .",
    "+      in one dimension , the first passage statistics related problem are basically formulated by considering a state variable which evolves stochastically according to a given law in its phase space .",
    "we are mainly concerned about the instant when the variable leaves a certain domain for the first time . to deal with such problem",
    "a number of several methods or approaches had been described in refs .",
    "@xcite . here , we describe two elegant methods ( i)backward fokker - planck ( bfp ) method and ( ii ) path decomposition method ( pd ) .      following ref .",
    "@xcite , we can introduce a general description to compute the pdf of a brownian functional in a time interval @xmath14 , where @xmath2 is the first passage time of the process .",
    "thus , one can introduce a functional to calculate different statistical properties of a brownian functional : @xmath15 where , @xmath16 is a brownian path which follows differential eq.(2 ) and it starts at @xmath0 at time @xmath17 and continues up to @xmath18 . here , @xmath19 is a specified function of the path and its form depends on the quantity we are interested to calculate . for example , if we are interested to calculate first passage time one should choose @xmath20 . on the other hand , for the area distribution one should consider @xmath21 .",
    "one can easily understand that @xmath22 is a random variable which can take different values for different brownian paths .",
    "the main goal is to calculate probability distribution @xmath23 .",
    "now , one may note that the random variable @xmath22 can be only positive for our choice of @xmath19 , thus , one may consider the laplace transform of the distribution @xmath24 : @xmath25 here , the angular bracket denotes the average over all possible paths starting at @xmath26 at @xmath17 and ending at the first time they cross the origin . for simplicity",
    ", we will drop the variable p in the function @xmath27 in the rest of our paper .",
    "now , to derive a differential equation for @xmath28 , we follow the method described in ref .",
    "thus , we split the interval @xmath29 into two parts . during the first interval @xmath30 , the path starts from @xmath0 and",
    "propagates up to @xmath31 . in the second interval @xmath32 ,",
    "the path starts at @xmath33 and ends at 0 at time @xmath2 . here ,",
    "@xmath34 is a fixed , infinitesimally small time interval . to leading order in @xmath34",
    ", we obtain : @xmath35 . as a result of",
    "that one can obtain from eq .",
    "( 4 ) : @xmath36 here , the angular bracket denotes the average over all possible realizations of @xmath37 .",
    "now , one can obtain from the dynamical equation for a free langevin particle , i.e. from @xmath38 that @xmath39 .",
    "now , expanding @xmath40 in powers of @xmath34 , and taking the averages over the noise by using the facts @xmath41 and @xmath42 as @xmath43 , one obtains , to lowest order in @xmath34 , the ordinary differential equation : @xmath44 _ boundary conditions : _ equation ( 6 ) is valid in the regime @xmath45 with the following boundary conditions : ( i ) as the initial position @xmath46 , the first passage time vanishes which gives us @xmath47 , ( ii)on the other hand , as @xmath48 , the first passage time diverges which results in @xmath49 . + thus , our scheme will be as follows .",
    "we can solve the differential eq .",
    "( 6 ) , termed as the bfp equation @xcite . by solving eq.(6 ) with appropriate boundary condition as mentioned above provides us the laplace transformed pdfs of various quantities which are determined by the choice of u(x ) .",
    "now , inverting the laplace transform with respect to p , one can obtain the desired pdf @xmath24 . on the other hand , the standard fokker - planck method adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite yields the distribution function p(x , t ) directly .",
    "thus , these two approaches are distinct , providing complementary information .",
    "the basic principle of this pd method is very simple .",
    "since , our motion in eq.(2 ) is markovian one can break a typical path into two parts .",
    "thus , the weightage of the whole path is the product of the weights of the two split parts @xcite .",
    "thus , the joint probability distribution @xmath13 of the maximum bubble size m and the occurrence time @xmath6 at which this maximum occurs before first passage .",
    "now , integrating over m , one can obtain the marginal distribution @xmath50 . the basic process to compute @xmath13 by splitting a typical path into two parts , before and after @xmath6 . here , weights @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the weighage of the path before and after @xmath6 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the total weight w of the whole path is : @xmath53 on the left - hand side of @xmath6 , the path propagates from @xmath0 at @xmath54 to @xmath55 at @xmath56 , without attaining the value @xmath57 or @xmath58 during the interval @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "now , the weight @xmath51 can be determined by using a path - integral treatment based on the feynman - kac formalism .",
    "let us we denote @xmath60 be the probability that the motion described by eq .",
    "( 2 ) exits the interval @xmath61 for the first time through the origin .",
    "thus , @xmath60 is the cumulative probability that the maximum before the first - passage time is @xmath62 .",
    "it is known that this function satisfies two boundary conditions : ( i ) @xmath63 and ( ii ) @xmath64 . let us consider a function @xmath65 which gives us the distribution function of a small displacement @xmath37 in time @xmath66 .",
    "now , using the markovian property of the dynamics ( 2 ) , one can show that : @xmath67 now , making a taylor expansion of @xmath68 and averaging over @xmath69 , and using @xmath70 and @xmath42 .",
    "thus , to the leading order in @xmath71 we obtain @xmath72 now , solving the above equation with the help of above mentioned boundary boundary condition , one can obtain : @xmath73 now , differentiating @xmath60 with respect to @xmath58 we obtain : @xmath74 now , the @xmath52 is obtained as @xmath75 on the other hand , the weight @xmath51 can be obtained from the white noise is gaussian and the probability of a path is given by : @xmath76 then , the weight @xmath51 is then obtained as a sum over contributions from all possible paths : @xmath77 where , @xmath78 and @xmath79 enforce the requirements that the path does not cross either the level @xmath57 or the level @xmath58 for times between @xmath57 and @xmath6 . now , following feynman - kac @xcite , the path integral can be identified with the propagator @xmath80 , corresponding to the quantum hamiltonian @xmath81 of a single particle of unit mass , @xmath82 with potential energy @xmath83 for @xmath84 and @xmath85 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "note , that the infinite potential energy at @xmath86 and at @xmath87 enforces the requirement that the path never crosses either the level 0 or level m. finally , @xmath88 where , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the eigenfunctions and eigenenergies , respectively for the hamiltonian @xmath81 .",
    "our primary focus is on several first - passage brownian functionals of physical relevance .",
    "we consider the following quantities and explore their pdfs . in this context",
    ", we explore a physical phenomenon of snowmelt dynamics for the fresh water availability in summer .",
    "+ ( i)_first passage time or lifetime of the stochastic process _ : the first - passage time pdf @xmath91 , i.e. , the pdf of the time of touching the origin first time with initial size @xmath0 , provides the information about the lifetime of the stochastic process .",
    "a related quantity is the survival probability @xmath92 of the process .",
    "this survival probability is an experimentally measurable quantity .",
    "for example , in the context of dna breathing dynamics @xmath93 can be inferred from experiments by measuring fluorescence correlations of a tagged dna @xcite . in the snow",
    "melt dynamics , our key stochastic variable is the total potential water availability , h ( in terms of water equivalent from both snow and rainfall ) .",
    "thus , the survival probability @xmath94 for a given initial snow water equivalent @xmath95 and the pdf of first passage time @xmath96 are very much useful quantities to offer important information about the timing between melting of snow and fresh water availability in summer under different climatic scenarios . + ( ii)_area under a path : _ if we consider a typical path which is described by eq .",
    "( 2 ) , one can define the area under such a path before the first - passage time as @xmath97 .",
    "the interesting quantity is its pdf @xmath98 with an initial value @xmath0 .",
    "this quantity is of interest because it provides a measure for the effectiveness of the corresponding stochastic processes .",
    "for example , if we consider the snow melt process , then @xmath99 gives us the information about the average total snow water equivalent with initial value @xmath95 .",
    "while the first - passage time distribution provides information about the lifetime , it does not contain any hint of the average total water equivalent before full melting .",
    "quantities ( i ) , ( ii)can be calculated below by following the bfp method discussed in sec .",
    "+ _ maximum size m : _ the other proposed measure for quantifying reactivity of the process is the distribution of the maximum size before the first - passage time , p(m ) . let us consider again snow melt process .",
    "now , the pdf @xmath4 provide us about the information about the maximum total available fresh water equivalent before total melting of snow .",
    "+ _ maximum size m and the corresponding time tm : _ the joint probability distribution function @xmath13 can be investigated here by following the pd method , which is based on the feynman - kac formalism @xcite ( see sec .",
    "iib-2 ) . using this pdf , one can further calculate the distribution function @xmath50 of the time at which the process attains its maximum size before hitting the origin .",
    "this latter pdf is of interest because it provides information about the ( average ) time of occurrence of the biggest size before hitting the origin .",
    "snowmelt is one of the main source of freshwater for many regions of the world and the snowmelt process is very much sensitive to temperature and precipitation fluctuations @xcite .",
    "snow dynamics is basically consists of two phases : ( a ) an accumulation phase in which snow water equivalent ( i.e. the amount of liquid water available by total and instantaneous melting of the entire snowmass ) rises to its seasonal maximum @xmath100 and the other one is ( b)the depletion phase where the whole snowpack gradually decreases ( release of stored water content ) due to temperature fluctuation . to describe such a complex dynamics one needs a lot of physical parameters .",
    "now , we are trying to build a simplified stochastic model which can describe the total water equivalent from both snow and rainfall during the melting season , as driven by both precipitation ( solid to liquid transition ) and increasing air temperature . due to simplification of the stochastic model",
    ", we consider the total potential water availability ( in terms of water equivalent ) as the main stochastic variable . here , we neglect any other effects connected with snow percolation and metamorphism etc . @xcite .",
    "the predominant factors which govern the fresh water availability in the warm season are increasing air temperature and liquid precipitation .",
    "accordingly , we assume the melting phase can be described by a power - law time dependent drift directed towards the total melting of the snowpack .",
    "on the other hand , positive and negative exponents of power - law diffusion usually represent precipitation events and pure melting periods , respectively .",
    "following the `` degree - day '' approach with time - varying melting - rate coefficients , one can assume the melting process can be described by a linear function of time @xcite .",
    "considering a power - law form for drift and diffusion during the melting season , the dynamics of the total water equivalent from both snow melting and precipitation at a given point in space can be reasonably described by the langevin equation @xcite : @xmath101 where , the drift part @xmath102 represents the accumulation or depletion with a rate constant @xmath103 and the diffusion rate is given by @xmath104 . also , both the rainfall and snowmelt contributions are included in @xmath105 . here",
    ", we assume that the drift and the diffusion follow the same power law with exponent @xmath106 .",

    "<S> in this paper , we investigate a brownian motion ( bm ) with purely time dependent drift and difusion by suggesting and examining several brownian functionals which characterize the lifetime and reactivity of such stochastic processes . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce several probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) associated with such time dependent bms . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , for a bm with initial starting point @xmath0 , we derive analytical expressions for : ( i ) the pdf @xmath1 of the first passage time @xmath2 which specify the lifetime of such stochastic process , ( ii ) the pdf @xmath3 of the area a till the first passage time and it provides us numerous valuable information about the effective reactivity of the process , ( iii ) the pdf @xmath4 associated with the maximum size m of the bm process before the first passage time , and ( iv)the joint pdf @xmath5 of the maximum size m and its occurrence time @xmath6 before the first passage time . </S>",
    "<S> these distributions are examined for the power law time time dependent drift and diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> a simple illustrative example for the stochastic model of water resources availability in snowmelt dominated regions with power law time dependent drift and diffusion and is demonstrated in details . </S>",
    "<S> we motivate our study with approximate calculation of an unsolved problem of brownian functionals including inertia . </S>"
