    "the order parameter will undergo a relaxation process displaying an initial increase .",
    "as long as the correlations are short - ranged and the spatial dimension @xmath0 is smaller than the critical dimension @xmath51 , the order parameter follows a mean - field ordering process because the mean - field critical temperature @xmath52 is larger than the actual critical temperature @xmath53 .",
    "this ordering causes an amplification of the initial order parameter . for @xmath54 mean - field theory applies and there is no critical increase .    for the sri models @xmath55 .",
    "the longer is the interaction range , the stronger the suppression of the fluctuations and hence the critical dimension of the lri model is smaller .",
    "indeed , it turns out that @xmath56 . also one would expect that the critical initial increase should be weaker as the interaction range becomes longer",

    "@xmath59 is very small and the numerical values of the exponents are accurate when computed to order @xmath65 .",
    "however , when the interaction range is not very long , the situation becomes more complicated , due to a subtle competition between the sri and the lri fixed points [ 6 - 9 ] .",
    "honkonen @xcite computed the @xmath66-function of the renormalisation group for the pure lri model at three - loops and found that the infrared lri fixed point becomes unstable for @xmath67 . in the pure lri model",
    "the exchange interaction term is not renormalised , so that the anomalous dimension of the field @xmath68 is zero , whereas in the sri model the field carries some anomalous dimension @xmath69 . taking the limit @xmath70 the expressions for the anomalous dimension ( and for other critical exponents )",
    "do not coincide .",
    "however , as first shown by sak @xcite to the leading non - trivial order and later by honkonen and nalimov @xcite to all order in @xmath71 , the anomalous dimension @xmath69 and the other exponents are continuous functions of the parameter @xmath63 .",
    "this means that the scaling regime of the lri model is valid only for @xmath72 , whereas for @xmath73 the scaling behaviour is described by the sri model . at the borderline value @xmath74 the two descriptions yield equal values for the critical exponents .",
    "let us conclude here by remarking that these last results were obtained solely for static models .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 , the lri model with @xmath75 is studied by the @xmath59 expansion method .",
    "the scaling behaviour of the order parameter , correlation and response functions , as well as the corresponding critical initial slip exponents , are obtained .",
