    "since the curie temperature of ferromagnetic metals like iron , cobalt , and nickel is of the order of electrostatic energies in solids , i.e. , is much higher than the interaction energy of the electron spins , itinerant ferromagnetism is expected to be the result of the interplay between the ordinary spin-_in_dependent coulomb interaction and the kinetic energy of the electrons , in combination with the pauli principle @xcite . as such it is one of the fundamental cooperative phenomena in condensed matter physics .    until recently the theory of itinerant ferromagnetism was investigated by two essentially separate communities , one using model hamiltonians in conjunction with many - body techniques ( or even rigorous mathematical methods @xcite ) , the other employing density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "dft and its local density approximation ( lda ) have the advantage of being _ ab initio _ approaches which do not require empirical parameters as input .",
    "indeed , they are highly successful techniques for the calculation of the electronic structure of real materials . however , in practice dft / lda is restricted in its ability to describe strongly correlated materials . here , the model hamiltonian approach is more general and powerful since there exist systematic theoretical methods to investigate the many - electron problem with increasing accuracy . nevertheless , the uncertainty in the choice of the model parameters and the technical complexity of the correlation problem itself prevent the model hamiltonian approach from being a flexible or reliable enough tool for studying real materials",
    ". the two approaches are therefore complementary .",
    "originally the one - band hubbard model was introduced to gain insight into the origin of metallic ferromagnetism @xcite . however , even for this simplest possible microscopic model answers are not easily obtained since in general metallic ferromagnetism occurs at _ intermediate _ couplings and off half filling @xcite .",
    "thus , this cooperative phenomenon belongs to the class of problems where standard perturbation techniques are not applicable .",
    "in particular , weak - coupling theories or renormalization group approaches @xcite which are so effective in detecting instabilities with respect to antiferromagnetism or superconductivity meet with limited success here . in general , _ non - perturbative _",
    "investigations are required .    during the last couple of years",
    "significant progress was made in the theoretical understanding of the microscopic foundations of metallic ferromagnetism .",
    "they were made possible mainly by the development ( i )  of new analytic approaches , such as the mathematical methods used to investigate flat - band ferromagnetism @xcite and its extensions @xcite as well as dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite , ( ii ) of new numerical techniques , such as the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) which yields precise results in @xmath2 @xcite , and ( iii ) of new comprehensive approximation schemes such as the multi - band gutzwiller wave function @xcite , or the new _ ab initio _ computational scheme lda+dmft @xcite which merges conventional band structure theory ( lda ) with a comprehensive many - body technique ( dmft ) .    in this paper",
    "the insights gained with the help of the dmft will be reviewed .",
    "after a short introduction into this approach ( section [ dmft ] ) , the microscopic conditions for metallic ferromagnetism in the one - band hubbard model ( section [ sec : oneband ] ) and in the case of the orbitally degenerate model ( section [ sec : zweiband ] ) are explained and the differences discussed .",
    "furthermore , the physics of itinerant ferromagnetism in more complicated models , e.g. , the ferromagnetic kondo lattice model with coulomb correlations for manganites with perovskite structure , is analyzed .",
    "a conclusion and outlook ( section [ sec : concl ] ) closes the presentation .",
    "during the last decade a new many - body approach was developed which is especially well - suited for the investigation of correlated electronic systems with strong local interactions  the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite .",
    "it becomes exact for @xmath3 , i.e. , for lattices with coordination number @xmath4 @xcite . why is the investigation of this limit useful and interesting ?",
    "the answer is that already in @xmath5 the coordination number of regular lattices , such as the fcc lattice , is quite large ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "it is therefore quite natural to view @xmath7 as a large number , and to consider the limit @xmath8 as a starting point @xcite . to obtain a meaningful model in this limit one has to scale the nn   hopping amplitude in the kinetic energy ( see below ) as @xmath9 ( in the following we set @xmath10 and thereby fix the energy scale ) .",
    "then one obtains a purely local theory where the self - energy @xmath11 becomes @xmath12 independent and where the propagator @xmath13 may be represented by the non - interacting propagator at a shifted frequency  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the quantum mechanical correlation problem is then fully included .",
    "that is why this theory is referred to as `` dynamical mean - field theory '' ( dmft ) .",
    "we note that due to the local nature of the theory there is no _ short_-range order in position space .    within dmft",
    "the electronic lattice problem is mapped onto an effective self - consistent single - impurity anderson model @xcite .",
    "dmft is a non - perturbative , thermodynamically consistent theoretical framework within which the dynamics of correlated lattice electrons with local interaction can be investigated at all coupling strengths .",
    "this is of essential importance for problems like band - ferromagnetism or the metal - insulator transition @xcite which set in at a coulomb interaction strength comparable to the electronic band width .    in dmft the information about the lattice or the dispersion of the system under investigation enters only through the density of states ( dos ) @xmath14 of the _ non_-interacting particles , unless there is long - range order with broken translational symmetry of the lattice as in the case of antiferromagnetism . in finite dimensions , e.g. , @xmath5 , dmft is then an approximation  usually an excellent one as is manifested by the plethora of results obtained within the last decade @xcite .",
    "dmft is presently the only comprehensive , thermodynamically consistent computational scheme which allows one to investigate the dynamics of correlated lattice electrons on all energy scales .    due to its equivalence to an anderson impurity problem a variety of approximative techniques have been employed to solve the complicated dmft equations , such as the iterated perturbation theory ( ipt ) @xcite and the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) @xcite , as well as numerically exact techniques like quantum monte - carlo simulations ( qmc ) @xcite , exact diagonalization ( ed ) @xcite , or the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite .",
    "however , nrg can not yet be used to solve the dmft equations for multi - band models .    in the present paper",
    "all dmft results were obtained by qmc .",
    "this is a particularly well - tested and reliable , albeit computer - expensive method which may be employed down to temperatures @xmath15 ( @xmath16 : band width ) and at not too strong interactions .",
    "the one - band hubbard model@xmath17is the simplest lattice model for correlated electrons , and was originally proposed to understand metallic ferromagnetism in 3@xmath18 transition metals @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath19 is a general hopping matrix element between sites @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in the past the kinetic energy in ( [ eqn : hub ] )",
    "was usually restricted to nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hopping ; then it is useful to divide the underlying lattices into bipartite and non - bipartite ones .",
    "this distinction ceases to be useful if , in addition to nn   hopping @xmath22 , longer - range hopping , in particular next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) hopping @xmath23 is considered .",
    "the hubbard model is characterized by a purely local interaction term which is completely independent of the lattice structure and dimension . therefore in this model the kinetic energy of the electrons ( i.e. , the dispersion ) and the structure of the lattice are very important for the stability of metallic ferromagnetism .",
    "this is well - known from the approximate investigations by gutzwiller @xcite , hubbard @xcite , kanamori @xcite and nagaoka @xcite , and has recently been confirmed , and made precise , by detailed investigations @xcite .",
    "on bipartite lattices the @xmath23-hopping term destroys the antiferromagnetic nesting instability at small @xmath0 ( see , for example hofstetter98 ) by shifting spectral weight to the band edges and thereby introducing an asymmetry into the otherwise symmetric dos .",
    "it will be shown below that a high spectral weight at the band edge ( more precisely : the _ lower _ band edge for @xmath24 ) minimizes the loss of kinetic energy of the overturned spins in the magnetic state and is hence energetically favorable .",
    "therefore frustrated , i.e. ,  non - bipartite lattices , or bipartite lattices with frustration due to further - range hopping ( e.g. ,  @xmath25 ) support the stabilization of metallic ferromagnetism .",
    "the fcc lattice is an example of a frustrated lattice in @xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding dos of the non - interacting particles is shown in fig .",
    "fig : fccdos .",
    "switching on an additional nnn  hopping @xmath23 further increases the spectral weight at the lower band edge . for @xmath26 one even obtains a square - root - like divergence .     with and without additional nnn  hopping @xmath27 .",
    "]    to understand why a high spectral weight at the band edge is favorable for the kinetic energy we first consider the case @xmath28 , @xmath24  vollhardt97b+99 .",
    "let us consider a flat , symmetric dos .",
    "the fully polarized state is obtained by inverting the spin of the down electrons , which due to the pauli principle have to occupy higher energy states .",
    "counting the energy from the lower band edge the fermi energy of the polarized state , @xmath29 , is seen to be twice that of the unpolarized state .",
    "this should be contrasted with a dos having large spectral weight at the lower band edge . here",
    "the fermi level of the polarized state is not so strongly shifted upwards , i.e. ,  fewer high energy states are populated , which is clearly energetically favorable .",
    "the energy difference between the fully polarized state and the unpolarized state @xmath30\\;de\\;n^{0}(e)\\;e\\]]must become negative for the ferromagnetic state to be stable .",
    "of course , in the non - interacting case one has @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , even for @xmath28 , @xmath32 attains its lowest value for a dos with peaked spectral weight at the lower band edge for all @xmath24  @xcite . to show that @xmath33 for @xmath34 requires a reliable calculation of the energy of the _ correlated paramagnet_. indeed ,",
    "this is one of the central , most difficult problems of electronic correlation theory .",
    "it should be noted that the above discussion concerning the shape of the dos goes beyond the well - known stoner criterion which predicts a ferromagnetic instability of the paramagnet for @xmath0 equal to the inverse of the dos precisely _ at _ the fermi level .      since metallic ferromagnetism is an intermediate - coupling problem purely analytic approaches alone can not provide sufficient information , in particular in dimensions @xmath35 .",
    "in this situation the development of new numerical techniques during the last few years was of crucial importance for progress in this field .",
    "in particular , for one - dimensional systems the dmrg @xcite , and for high - dimensional systems the dmft have led to important insights . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to results obtained by dmft .    by a suitable generalization of the dispersion relation in three dimensions ,",
    "frustrated lattices like the fcc lattice can be defined in any dimension , in particular in @xmath3 @xcite . with the proper scaling of the hopping term ( see above ) the non - interacting dos of the _",
    "g_eneralized _ fcc _ lattice in @xmath3 is obtained as : @xmath36it has a strong square - root divergence at the lower band edge , @xmath37 , and no upper band edge .",
    "investigations of the stability of metallic ferromagnetism on fcc - type lattices within dmft , in combination with finite - temperature qmc techniques to solve the dmft equations , were first performed by ulmke @xcite . to detect a ferromagnetic instability",
    "one calculates the temperature dependence of the uniform static susceptibility @xmath38 from the corresponding two - particle correlation function @xcite . for @xmath39 and at an intermediate interaction strength of @xmath40 the ferromagnetic response",
    "is found to be strongest around quarter filling ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the susceptibility @xmath38 is seen to obey a curie - weiss law ( fig .",

    "error - bars are of the size of the symbols or smaller .",
    "the value of @xmath42 at @xmath44 is a data point , not an extrapolation .",
    "the dotted line is a linear fit to @xmath42 , the dashed line a fit with a brillouin function to @xmath45 @xcite .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    thus the curie temperature @xmath46 can be safely extrapolated from the zero of @xmath47 . for @xmath43",
    "this leads to a value of @xmath48 .",
    "below @xmath46 the magnetization @xmath45 ( a one - particle quantity determined by the local propagator ) grows rapidly , reaching more than 80% of the fully polarized value ( @xmath49 ) at the lowest temperature ( 30% below @xmath46 ) .",
    "the three data points @xmath50 in fig .",
    "[ fig : figferro1 ] are consistent with a brillouin function with the same critical temperature of @xmath51 and an extrapolated full polarization at @xmath52 .",
    "( we note that a saturated ground - state magnetization is also consistent with the single - spin - flip analysis of the fully polarized state by uhrig @xcite ) .",
    "so one finds _",
    "simultaneously _ a curie - weiss - type static susceptibility with brillouin - function - type magnetization , _ and _ a non - integer magneton number , in qualitative agreement with experiments on 3@xmath18 transition metals . in the past , these features were attributed to seemingly opposite physical pictures : the former to localized spins , and the latter to itinerant electrons .",
    "however , this was only because of the use of oversimplified , _",
    "static _ mean - field - type theories like weiss mean - field theory ( for spin models ) and hartree - fock ( for electrons ) . here",
    "we see that these properties are natural features of _ correlated _ electronic systems , which are generated by the quantum dynamics of the many - body problem . within dmft this `` paradoxical '' behavior of band ferromagnets",
    "is resolved without difficulty .",
    "collecting the values of @xmath53 obtained by @xmath54 , the boundaries between the ferromagnetic and the paramagnetic phases are determined .",

    "in this paper we reviewed recent developments in our understanding of the origin of metallic ferromagnetism in the one - band hubbard model and in band - degenerate models on the basis of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "in the one - band hubbard model metallic ferromagnetism is found to exist in a surprisingly large region of the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 phase diagram .",
    "a stabilization of this phase at intermediate @xmath0 values requires a sufficiently large spectral weight near one of the band edges as is typical for frustrated ( e.g. , fcc - type ) lattices which optimize the kinetic energy of the polarized state and , at the same time , frustrate the parasitic antiferromagnetic order .",
    "this finding , together with the results obtained for dimension @xmath2 @xcite , finally establishes the stability of band ferromagnetism in the one - band hubbard model on regular lattices and at intermediate values of the interaction @xmath0 and density @xmath1 .",
    "thereby one of the prominent questions of many - body theory in this field is finally answered .    by contrast , the origin of metallic ferromagnetism in the band - degenerate hubbard model at intermediate @xmath0 values is not primarily a spectral weight effect but is already caused by moderately strong hund s rule couplings . in this respect the origin of ferromagnetism in the orbitally degenerate model is more straightforward than that in the ( less realistic ) one - band case .",
    "nevertheless , in the absence of orbital ordering the resulting magnetic phase diagrams are remarkably similar .",
    "the identification of a single main driving force for the stabilization of metallic ferromagnetism in the one - band and the band - degenerate hubbard model , respectively , helps to differentiate between different mechanisms .",
    "however , in real systems these effects will tend to conspire , as is evident , for example , in nickel where an fcc lattice leads to a strongly asymmetric dos and the band degeneracy brings with it hund s rule couplings .",
    "these insights also helped to understand the origin of itinerant ferromagnetism in more complicated models , e.g. , the ferromagnetic kondo lattice model with and without coulomb correlations , which is employed to understand the physics of manganites with perovskite structure , like la@xmath110(sr , ca)@xmath111mno@xmath112 .",
    "it was found that in this model double exchange can explain ferromagnetism only for doping @xmath137 . at lower values of @xmath130 the suppression of double occupations by the local coulomb repulsion",
    "becomes more and more important and leads to a crossover from double exchange to superexchange .",
    "this results in a maximum of the curie temperature in qualitative agreement with experiment .    as discussed in the introduction",
    "the problem of metallic ferromagnetism was , until recently , investigated by two essentially separate communities  one using model hamiltonians together with many - body techniques , the other employing density functional theory ( dft ) in the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "in view of the individual power of lda and the model hamiltonian approach it is highly desirable to combine these techniques , thereby creating an enormous potential for all future _ ab initio _ investigations of real materials , including , e.g. , @xmath138-electron systems , mott insulators and metallic ferromagnets .",
    "a combination of these two approaches had already been used to investigate band ferromagnetism some time ago @xcite .",
    "recently , a fusion has started to emerge in new directions .",
    "one is the construction of multi - band gutzwiller wave functions in combination with spin - density functional theory in the limit of large coordination numbers @xcite .",
    "it was already successfully applied to ferromagnetic nickel , leading to significant improvements over lda results .",
    "the other is the _ ab initio _ computational scheme lda+dmft @xcite which was recently used to investigate transition metal oxides and to calculate the magnetic excitation spectrum of ferromagnetic iron @xcite . without doubt",
    "these and related methods @xcite will rapidly develop into standard tools for future investigations of band ferromagnetism and other electronic correlation phenomena .",
