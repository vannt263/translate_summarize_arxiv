    "although the uncertainty principle is usually considered to be a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics , its precise theoretical formulation is not always clear . a breakthrough in the investigation of measurement uncertainties",
    "was achieved when ozawa demonstrated in 2003 that the uncertainty trade - off between measurement error and disturbance may be much lower than the uncertainty trade - off between non - commuting properties in a quantum state @xcite .",
    "recently , the definitions of measurement uncertainties introduced by ozawa have been evaluated experimentally using two - level systems such as neutron spins @xcite and photon polarizations @xcite .",
    "these experimental tests have confirmed the lower uncertainty limits predicted by ozawa and resulted in the formulation and confirmation of even tighter bounds @xcite .",
    "however , there has also been some controversy concerning the role of the initial state in this definition of measurement uncertainties @xcite .",
    "it may therefore be useful to take a closer look at the definition of measurement errors and their experimental evaluation .    in principle",
    ", it is natural to define the error of a measurement as the statistical average of the squared difference between the measurement outcome and the actual value of the target observable .",
    "however , quantum theory makes it difficult to assign a value to an observable when neither the initial state nor the final measurement is represented by an eigenstate of the observable",
    ". nevertheless , the operator formalism defines correlations between the measurement outcome and the operator @xmath0 that represents the target observable , and this correlation between operators can be evaluated by weak measurements @xcite or by statistical reconstruction using variations of the input state @xcite .",
    "essentially , the experimental evaluations of ozawa uncertainties is therefore based on an evaluation of non - classical correlations between the measurement outcome and the target observable in the initial quantum state @xmath1 .    in the following ,",
    "we investigate the role of non - classical correlations in quantum measurements by applying a sequential measurement to the polarization of a single photon , such that the initial measurement commutes with the target polarization , while the final measurement selects a complementary polarization . in this scenario ,",
    "the initial measurement can be described by classical error statistics , and the evaluation of the measurement errors corresponds to conventional statistical methods .",
    "however , the final measurement introduces non - classical correlations that provide additional information on the target observable . by varying the strength of the initial measurement",
    ", we can control the balance between classical and non - classical effects in the correlations .",
    "in addition , we obtain two separate measurement outcomes , one of which refers directly to the target observable , and another one which can only relate to the target observable via correlations in the input state .",
    "our measurement results thus provide a detailed characterization of non - classical effects in the relation between measurement outcomes and target observable . in particular , our results show that the intermediate measurement outcome modifies the non - classical correlations between the final outcome and the target observable , which can result in a counter - intuitive assignment of measurement values , where the intermediate measurement outcome and the estimates values seem to be anti - correlated .",
    "our results thus illustrate that the combination of classical and non - classical correlations can be highly non - trivial and should be investigated in detail to achieve a more complete understanding of the experimental analysis of quantum systems .",

    "however , the situation is not so simple if @xmath0 and @xmath4 do not commute . in this case ,",
    "an experimental evaluation of the measurement error @xmath9 requires the reconstruction of a genuine quantum correlation represented by operator products .",
    "perhaps the most direct method of obtaining the appropriate data is to vary the input state @xcite . to obtain the correlation between the measurement outcome @xmath3 and the observable @xmath0 , it is sufficient to use two superposition states as input , @xmath10 where the expectation values in the normalization factors refer to the statistics of the original state @xmath1",
    ". it is now possible to determine the correlation between the measurement outcome and the target observable from the weighted difference between the probabilities @xmath11 and @xmath12 obtained with these two superposition states . specifically , @xmath13 = \\frac{1}{4 \\lambda } \\left((1 + 2 \\lambda \\langle \\hat{a } \\rangle + \\lambda^2",

    "if the non - classical correlation in eq.([eq : ozawa ] ) is expressed using the conditional average in eq.([eq : condav ] ) , the result reads @xmath16 it is then obvious that the minimal error @xmath17 is obtained for @xmath18 , and that this minimal error is given by the difference between the original variance of @xmath0 in the quantum state @xmath19 and the variance of the conditional averages @xmath20 , @xmath21 importantly , all of the necessary information can be obtained experimentally using the superposition input states @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "as will be shown in the following , this means that for two level systems , the non - classical correlations can actually be derived from measurements performed on eigenstates of @xmath0 .",
    "in a two level system , all physical properties can be expressed in terms of operators with eigenvalues of @xmath24 .",
    "this results in a significant simplification of the formalism .",
    "in particular , it is possible to define the states @xmath25 and @xmath23 used for the experimental evaluation of non - classical correlations in the measurement errors by setting @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pm ] ) .",
    "the result is a projection onto eigenstates of @xmath0 , so that @xmath25 and @xmath23 are eigenstates of the target observable @xmath0 with eigenvalues of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",

    "( [ eq : evaluate ] ) , the relation for the two - level system with eigenvalues of @xmath29 and @xmath26 is @xmath30   = p(m|+ ) p(+|\\psi ) - p(m|- ) p(-|\\psi).\\ ] ] note that this looks like a fully projective measurement sequence , where a measurement of @xmath0 is followed by a measurement of @xmath3 .",
    "however , such a projective measurement of @xmath0 actually changes the probabilities of the final outcomes @xmath3 .",
    "it is therefore quite strange that the correlation between an undetected observable @xmath0 and the measurement result @xmath3 obtained from an initial state @xmath19 can be derived from a sequential projective measurement , as if the measurement disturbance of a projective measurement of @xmath0 had no effect on the final probabilities of @xmath3 .",
    "the non - classical features of the correlation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eval2l ] ) emerge when the conditional average is determined according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : condav ] ) , @xmath31 although this equation looks almost like a classical conditional average , it is important to note that the probabilities are actually obtained from two different measurements . as a result , the denominator is not given by the sum of the probabilities in the numerator .",
    "in fact , it is quite possible that @xmath32 is much lower than the sum of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , so that the conditional average @xmath20 is much larger than @xmath27 ( or much lower than @xmath28 ) .",
    "in fact , we should expect such anomalous enhancements of the conditional average , since eq .",
    "( [ eq : condav ] ) shows that @xmath20 is equal to the weak value of @xmath0 conditioned by @xmath19 and @xmath3 .",
    "it may seem confusing that the combination of statistical results obtained in two perfectly normal experiments results in the defintion of a seemingly paradoxical conditional average . however , this is precisely why quantum statistics have no classical explanation .",
    "in fact , the present two level paradox is simply a reformulation of the violation of leggett - garg inequalities @xcite , where it is shown that it is impossible to explain the probabilities @xmath32 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 as marginal probabilities of the same positive valued joint probability @xmath37 .",
    "effectively , the evaluation of measurement errors proposed by ozawa @xcite and applied in the first experimental demonstration @xcite is identical to the verification of leggett - garg inequality violation by parallel measurements proposed in @xcite and applied in @xcite .",
    "we can now look at the evaluation of the measurement errors in more detail . using the previous results to express eq .",
    "( [ eq : ozawa ] ) in terms of experimental probabilities , the measurement error is given by @xmath38 although this is already a great simplification , it is interesting to note that the evaluation used in the first experimental demonstration @xcite is even more simple .",
    "this is because of an additional assumption : if we only allow an assignment of @xmath39 , so that @xmath3 can be given by @xmath40 or @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 in many cases , errors are symmetric , so that @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "if this assumption is used , the evaluation of measurement errors is completely independent of the input state , since the probabilities of @xmath46 and of @xmath47 add up to one , and the error is simply given by the error observed for eigenstate inputs , @xmath48 importantly , this result is just a special case where the measurement error appears to be state independent because of a specific choice of @xmath6 for the evaluation of the measurement . in the following , we will consider a setup that explores the optimization of @xmath6 and the role of the non - classical correlations between measurement outcomes and target observable using the evaluation of experimental data developed above .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the anomalous values of the conditional averages @xmath20 that also provide the optimal assignments of measurement outcomes @xmath6 originate from the same experimental statistics that are used to violate leggett - garg inequalities .",
    "we are therefore particularly interested in the correlations between bloch vector components in the equatorial plane of the bloch sphere . in the case of photon polarization , these are the linear polarizations , where the horizontal ( h ) and vertical ( v ) polarizations define one axis and the diagonal polarizations corresponding to positive ( p ) and negative ( m ) superposition of h and v define the orthogonal axis . in terms of operators with eigenvalues of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , these polarizations can be expressed by @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "if our target observable is @xmath51 , any measurement that commutes with @xmath50 can be explained in terms of classical statistics .",
    "we therefore use a setup that implements a variable strength measurement of diagonal polarization similar to the one we previously used to study leggett - garg iequality violations and weak measurements @xcite . in the output",
    ", we then perform a measurement of hv - polarization , so that the total measurement does not commute with the target observable . by dividing the measurement into two parts",
    ", we can vary the strength of the non - classical effects and study the transition between classical correlations and quantum correlations in detail .",
    "followed by the projective measurement of @xmath49 .",
    "this interferometer was realized by using a hybrid cube of a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) and a beam splitter ( bs ) , where the input beam is split by the pbs part and the outputs interfere at the bs part of the cube .",
    "the variable strength measurement of the positive ( p ) and negative ( m ) superposition of horizontal ( h ) and vertical ( v ) polarizations is realized by path interference between the h and the v polarized component .",
    "the measurement strength of the pm measurement is controlled by the angle @xmath52 of one of two half - wave plates ( hwps ) inside the interferometer , which can be changed from zero for no measurement to 22.5@xmath53 for a fully projective measurement .",
    "the other hwp is used for a phase compensation between h and v components.,width=264 ]    the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . as explained in @xcite , a variable strength measurement is implemented by separating the horizintal and vertical polarizations at a polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) , rotating the polarizations towards each other using a half - wave plate ( hwp ) and interfering them at a beam splitter ( bs ) .",
    "the effect of the interference is to distinguish p - polarization from m - polarization , where the visibility of the interference and hence the strength of the measurement is controlled by the rotation angle of the hwp , where the angle @xmath52 can be changed from zero for no measurement to 22.5@xmath53 for a fully projective measurement . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] , the interferomter is a sagnac type , where the difference between input and output beam splitter is implemented by using a hybrid cube that acts as either a pbs or a bs , depending on the part of the cube on which the beam is incident .",

    "the output photon numbers in the output paths @xmath55 ( measurement outcome p or @xmath56 ) and in the path @xmath57 ( measurement outcome m or @xmath58 ) are counted by using the single photon detectors d1 and d2 , respectively .",
    "polarizers were inserted to realize the final measurement of @xmath49 , corrsponding to @xmath59 for h - polarization and @xmath60 for v - polarization .",
    "the number of input photons in the initial state was monitored with the single photon detector d3 in order to compensate fluctuations of intensity in the weak coherent light used as input . in the actual setup",
    ", we also detected a systematic difference between the reflectivity and the transmissivity of the final bs resulting in a slight change of the orientation of the measurement basis from the directions of pm - polarization .",
    "the cancellation of this systematic effect is achieved by exchanging the roles of path b1 and path b2 using the settings of the hwp , which effectively restores the proper alignment of the polarization axes with the measurement @xcite .",
    "the measurement has four outcomes @xmath61 given by the combinations of @xmath50 eigenvalues ( @xmath62 ) and @xmath49 eigenvalues ( @xmath63 ) . in the absence of experimental errors , the measurement outcomes can be described by pure state projections , @xmath64     of the pm - measurement obtained with p polarization ( @xmath65 ) as the initial state .",

    "the much higher probability of @xmath56 does not result in a comparative enhancement of this correlation , so that the estimated value @xmath97 for an outcome of @xmath56 is actually lower than the estimated value @xmath108 for an outcome of @xmath58 .",
    "these non - classical aspects of correlations between measurement results and target observable highlight the importance of the relation between the two measurement outcomes : it is impossible to isolate the measurement result @xmath77 from the context established by both @xmath19 and @xmath89 . since the estimated values @xmath94 correspond to weak values , this observation may also provide a practical example of the relation between weak values and contextuality @xcite .    in the limit of zero measurement strength ( @xmath86 ) , the estimated values depend only on @xmath89 , with the unlikely measurement outcome of @xmath59 resulting in an anomalous weak value of @xmath110 and the likely outcome of @xmath60 resulting in a weak value estimate of @xmath111 .",
    "since these estimates are based only on the outcomes of precise measurements of hv - polarization , they provide a direct illustration of the non - classical correlation between @xmath50 and @xmath49 in @xmath19 . due to the specific choice of initial state , @xmath112 is larger than @xmath113 , which means that the detection of h - polarization makes p - polarization more likely , while the detection of v - polarization increases the likelihood of m - polarization .",
    "if we disregard for a moment that the estimated values for @xmath59 lie outside the range of possible eigenvalues , we can give a fairly intuitive characterization of this non - classical correlation .",
    "clearly , the lowest likelihood is assigned to the combination of h - polarization and m - polarization , which are the least likely polarization results obtained in separate measurements of hv - polarization and pm - polarization for the input state @xmath19 .",

    "in fact , the error for this assignment exceeds the uncertainty of @xmath119 for the initial state @xmath19 at measurement strengths of @xmath120 , indicating that one can obtain a better estimate of pm - polarization from the expectation value of the input state .",
    "this never happens in the case of the errors @xmath121 associated with the optimal estimates of the target observable , since the optimized estimates based on the conditional averages for the different measurement outcomes include the information of the initial state . in the case of the classical estimate @xmath85 obtained from the variable strength pm - measurement , the measurement error drops gradually from the variance of the initial state at @xmath86 to a residual error caused by the limited visibility @xmath122 at @xmath100 . by including the information of the final hv - measurement ,",
    "the estimate can be improved to @xmath94 , resulting in a reduction of the error that is particularly significant when the measurement strength approaches @xmath86 .",
    "the most interesting experimental result is definitely the error obtained for the optimal estimate @xmath94 , which summarizes all of the available information in the estimates shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aopt ] .",
    "theoretically , the error of this estimate would be zero if the measurements could be performed without any experimental imperfections , as indicated by the red solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] .",
    "the actual results are close to zero error in the limit of low measurement strength . in this limit ,",
    "the high visibility of the final hv - measurement for @xmath89 dominate the estimate , with a much lower impact of the less reliable pm - measurement for @xmath77 .",
    "the errors then start to rise as the experimental values of @xmath108 in fig .",
    "[ fig : aopt ] reach their maximal values near @xmath123 .",
    "the value of the error continues to rise beyond the maximum of @xmath108 and reaches its maximal value near the @xmath104 crossing point where @xmath124 . at this point ,",
    "the estimate is particularly sensitive to measurement noise , since the extremely low probabilities of an outcome of @xmath103 are strongly affected by experimental noise backgrounds . for measurement stengths greater than this crossing point ( @xmath125 ) ,",
    "the error of @xmath94 is not much lower than the error of @xmath85 , indicating that the final measurement result @xmath89 provides only very little additional measurement information on @xmath50 .",
    "this appears to be a result of the experimental noise in the pm - measurement , which limits the error to @xmath126 at a maximal measurement strength of @xmath100 .    in summary",
    ", the analysis of the measurement errors shows that the non - classical correlation between @xmath89 and @xmath50 used to obtain the estimate @xmath94 in the limit of weak measurement interactions results in much lower errors than the use of the classical correlations between @xmath77 and @xmath50 that dominate in the strong measurement regime .",
    "this is a result of the fact that the errors in the limit of weak measurement are dominated by the hv - visibility of the setup , while the errors in the strong measurement regime mostly originate from the pm visibility , which happens to be much lower than the hv - visibility in the present setup .",
    "our setup is therefore ideally suited to illustrate the importance of non - classical correlations in the evaluation of measurement errors when the initial state is taken into account .",
    "the optimal estimate @xmath94 is obtained by considering the specific relation between the measurement outcomes and the target observable in the specific input state , which may result in counter - intuitive assignments of values to the different measurement outcomes . in the present case ,",
    "the lowest errors are obtained as a consequence of this counter - intuitive assignment , since the experimental setup is particularly robust against experimental imperfections in the regime of low measurement strength which is most sensitive to the effects of non - classical correlations .",
    "our results thus provide a particularly clear experimental demonstration of the reduction of measurement errors by non - classical correlations between measurement result and target observable in the initial quantum state .",
    "we have investigated the non - classical correlations between the outcomes of a quantum measurement and the target observable of the measurement by studying the statistics of measurement errors in a sequential measurement . in the initial measurement ,",
    "the measurement operator commutes with the target observable and the measurement outcome @xmath77 relates directly to the target observable , while the final measurement of a complementary observable introduces the effect of non - classical correlations between the outcome @xmath89 and the target observable . to evaluate the errors",
    ", we applied the operator formalism introduced by ozawa and show that the evaluation of two - level statistics can be performed by combining the measurement statistics of the input state @xmath19 with the statistics obtained from eigenstate inputs of the target observable . by combining the statistics of separate measurements according to the rules obtained from the operator formalism ,",
    "it is possible to identify the optimal estimate of the target observable using only the available experimental data . due to the specific combination of the statistical results ,",
    "this estimate can exceed the limits of classical statistics by obtaining values that lie outside the range of possible eigenvalues .",
    "typically , the least likely outcomes are associated with extreme values of the target observable . in the present experiment",
    ", we find extremely high estimates of the target observable when the strength of the initial measurement is weak and the measurement result is dominated by the non - classical correlations between the target observable and the complementary observable detected in the final measurement . in this limit ,",
    "the initial measurement outcome that refers directly to the target observable mainly enhances or reduces the effects of the non - classical correlations , which results in the counter - intuitive anti - correlation between the actual measurement result and the associated estimate of the target observable for a final outcome of @xmath59 .",
    "our discussion provides a more detailed insight into the experimental analysis of measurent errors that has recently been used to evaluate the uncertainty limits of quantum measurements derived by ozawa @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the estimation procedure associated with this kind of error analysis also reveals important details of the non - classical statistics originating from the correlations between physical properties in the initial state . in the present work ,",
    "we have taken a closer look at the experimental analysis of measurement errors and clarified its non - classical features .",
    "the results show that some of the effects involved in the optimal evaluation of the experimental data are rather counter - intuitive and exhibit features that exceed the possibilities of classical statistics in significant ways . for a complete understanding of measurement statistics in quantum mechanics ,",
    "it is therefore necessary to explore the effects of non - classical correlations in more detail , and the present study may be a helpful starting point for a deeper understanding of the role such correlations can play in various measurement contexts .",
