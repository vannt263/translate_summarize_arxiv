    "most o and b stars in the galactic disk are found in young star clusters or ob associations , where they often reside in binaries . about 30% of the o stars and 510% of the b stars",
    "are found in the field .",
    "these objects almost invariably have large space velocities ( 30200 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "most of these ` runaway ' stars appear to be single .",
    "many have high he abundance , and rotate fast .",
    "two scenarios for the formation of runaway stars are considered viable : ( i ) a supernova explosion in a massive binary ( zwicky 1957 ; blaauw 1961 ) , in which the primary becomes a compact object , and the secondary moves away with a velocity comparable to its pre - explosion orbital velocity , and ( ii ) dynamical ejection from a dense stellar cluster ( poveda et al .",
    "1967 ; gies & bolton 1986 ) .",
    "both scenarios can explain the properties of the ensemble of runaway stars observed to date . as a result",
    ", the relative importance of the two scenarios has been debated extensively in the past decades .    in order to find specific rather than statistical evidence for either scenario",
    ", we need to establish a common origin for either a runaway star and a pulsar or a runaway star and a dense stellar cluster .",
    "the availability of hipparcos milli - arcsec ( mas ) global astrometry for the nearby stars , and of pulsar astrometry provided by vlbi and timing measurements , therefore stimulated us to carry out a systematic study of the past orbits of the nearby runaways and pulsars .",
    "the full study will be reported elsewhere ( hoogerwerf et al .",
    "2000 ) ; here we restrict ourselves to a brief summary of some of the main results .",
    "blaauw ( 1952 ) proposed that the o9.5v runaway star @xmath0 oph originated in the nearby association sco ob2 .",
    "it is a single star , appears to be a blue straggler , and has he abundance @xmath4 and @xmath5 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the space motion of @xmath0 oph is @xmath640 km s@xmath1 relative to sco ob2 , and the star traversed the 5 myr old subgroup upper scorpius @xmath61 myr ago .",
    "the kinematics of the expanding hi shell which surrounds upper scorpius is consistent with a supernova explosion around the same time , and the present - day mass function of the subgroup indicates that about 40 @xmath7 is missing ( de geus 1992 ) .",
    "it is therefore natural to speculate that the supernova occurred in a massive binary , and that @xmath0 oph is the former secondary .",
    "mass transfer during the binary evolution prior to the explosion would then be the cause of the increased he abundance , the large rotation velocity , and the blue straggler nature .",
    "can we find the compact object ?",
    "the catalog of pulsars with distances and proper motions maintained by taylor , manchester & lyne ( 1993 ) contains seven objects within 1 kpc with measurement accuracy better than 10% .",
    "the radial velocities @xmath8 of these pulsars are unknown , so we retraced their paths in the gravitational field of the galaxy by numerical orbit integration for a range of @xmath9 500 km s@xmath1 in @xmath10 . taking into account the characteristic age @xmath11 of the pulsars",
    "leaves only one likely candidate : psr j1932 + 1059 .",
    "if its @xmath12 km s@xmath1 , then it passed through upper scorpius about 1 myr ago , on its way towards the galactic plane ( which it recently crossed ) .",
    "if the pulsar did not originate in upper scorpius , then it must have been launched from the galactic plane some @xmath6 50 myr ago .",
    "this is unlikely given a characteristic age of about 3 myr .",
    "having identified the most likely pulsar , we computed the absolute minimum separation @xmath13 between the orbits of @xmath0 oph and psr j1932 + 1059 , while sampling the error distributions in position and velocity .",
    "the main uncertainties are the errors in the parallax of @xmath0 oph ( @xmath14 mas ) and the pulsar ( @xmath15 mas , campbell 1995 ) , and the remaining range in @xmath8 .",
    "we found that the distribution of @xmath13 is consistent with @xmath0 oph and the pulsar being _ in the same location _",
    "@xmath16 myr ago in upper scorpius ( figures 1 & 2 ) .",
    "this is compelling dynamical evidence for the binary supernova scenario .",
    "the value of @xmath17 is an uncertain age indicator , and the @xmath18 myr for psr j1932 + 1059 is consistent with the dynamical age of 1 myr derived here . while the current period is 0.22 seconds , the implied period at birth is 0.18 seconds .",
    "pulsars are expected to receive a kick velocity @xmath19 at birth .",
    "observations of the ensemble of pulsars suggest that @xmath20 is a few hundred km s@xmath1 ( hartman 1997 ; hansen & phinney 1997 ) . assuming that @xmath0 oph and psr j1932 + 1059 originated in the same binary allows a determination of @xmath19 .",
    "based on the angle between the orbits of the two objects , and the magnitude of the space velocities , we find @xmath21 km s@xmath1 .",
    "new vlbi observations of the proper motion and parallax of psr j1932 + 1059 which are being obtained by campbell ( priv .  comm . ) will make it possible to improve this estimate further .",
    "blaauw & morgan ( 1954 ) drew attention to the isolated stars ae aur ( o9.5 v ) and @xmath2 col ( o9.5v / b0v ) , which run away in opposite directions from the association ori ob1 with space velocities of about 100 km s@xmath1 each ( figure 3 ) .",
    "blaauw & morgan speculated that both stars originated in the same event in ori ob1 , some 2.5 myr ago .",
    "gies & bolton ( 1986 ) suggested that this event was an encounter between two hard binaries , which also produced the eccentric massive binary @xmath3 ori ( o9iii+b1iii ) .",
    "we used the globally accurate hipparcos proper motions and parallaxes , and published radial velocities to retrace the orbits of @xmath3 ori and the two runaways .",
    "we carried out @xmath22 experiments to sample the error distribution in the measurements ( the largest uncertainties are in the parallax , as the objects are at distances of @xmath23 pc ) .",
    "we found that the distribution of the radius @xmath24 of the minimum volume enclosing the three objects is consistent with ae aur , @xmath2 col and @xmath3 ori being _ simultaneously in one location _",
    "@xmath25 myr ago .",
    "this is strong evidence for the dynamical ejection scenario .",
    "it is of interest to ask , where did the binary - binary encounter occur ?",
    "we assumed that the center - of - mass motion of the four stars involved in the encounter was identical to the mean motion of the parent cluster . by using conservation of linear momentum",
    ", we then computed the current location and mean motion of the cluster .",
    "this is somewhat sensitive to the masses of ae aur and @xmath2 col , but all data are consistent with the binary - binary encounter taking place in the nascent trapezium cluster ( figure 3 ) .",
    "this identification is supported by the age of @xmath62 myr ( palla & stahler 1999 ) , the high stellar density , the short dynamical time as evidenced by mass segregration ( hillenbrand & hartmann 1998 ) , and the high binary fraction ( weigelt et al .",
    "1999 ) of the trapezium cluster .",
    "the results from the previous two sections demonstrate that runaway stars are created both by binary supernova explosions and by dynamical ejection , and that it is now possible to identify individual events .",
    "enlarging the sample would provide a probe of the recent history of massive star formation in the galactic disk , and would constrain the fraction of binaries in young clusters ( portegies zwart 1999 ) .",
    "we therefore took all 3622 o  b5 stars in the hipparcos catalog with ( i ) measured radial velocity @xmath8 ( 1118 ) , ( ii ) parallax @xmath26 ( which translates to a distance less than about 700 pc ) , ( iii ) accurate proper motion @xmath27 , and ( iv ) space velocity @xmath28 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this produced 56 runaway candidates .",
    "similarly , we took all the pulsars in the taylor et al.(1993 ) catalog with ( i ) measured distance and proper motions ( 94 ) , a distance estimate of @xmath29 kpc , and ( iii ) accurate proper motion @xmath27 .",
    "this leaves only seven pulsars .",
    "we then retraced the orbits of all these objects , to identify the sites of origin .",
    "this work is in progress .",
    "both samples are severely incomplete .",
    "the hipparcos catalog is complete only for @xmath30 ( depending on latitude ) , and less than a third of the o and b stars in it have a measured radial velocity . because of beamed radio emission , we can not observe all pulsars , and not all of those that do radiate in our direction have been found ; of these , only a few have an accurately measured proper motion .",
    "even so , to date we have found the parent stellar group for two more pulsars ( in addition to psr j1932 + 1059 ) and for @xmath620 runaway stars ( 10 of which are new ) .",
    "the two pulsars both originate in the @xmath31 myr old association per ob3 .",
    "this is not surprising , as the peak of pulsar production occurs for the lower - mass b stars , i.e. , in old groups .",
    "twenty of the 56 runaway stars can be linked to the nearby associations .",
    "other runaways in the sample presumably originate in open clusters , including a newly - discovered pair of stars running away in opposite directions from the region of the @xmath32 ori cluster .",
    "further progress requires accurate space motions for the young open clusters in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "some of the remaining runaways ( and pulsars ) must have originated beyond 700 pc , where our knowledge of the parent groups is poor .",
    "much can be learned by measuring radial velocities for the nearby o and b field stars , and by increasing the sample of pulsars with measured astrometry . at the current accuracy of about 1 mas in parallax and 1 mas / yr in proper motion ,",
    "a full census is possible of the nearby 500 pc .",
    "extension to a larger volume requires @xmath2as astrometry , which will be provided by future space observatories such as diva , fame , and gaia .",
