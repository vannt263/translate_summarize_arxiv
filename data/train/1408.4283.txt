    "in a series of papers , long ago , de felice and coworkers @xcite defined and studied the relative strains among a set of comoving particles in black hole spacetimes , confined to a normal neighborhood of the observer s world line and in a well specified state of motion . the particles were considered as test with respect to the background geometry .    starting from that analysis",
    ", we consider here how the definition of relative accelerations and strains is affected by the geometric properties of the frame adapted to the fiducial observer ( e.g. transport law of the spatial triad along the observer s congruence ) . within this more general context",
    "we reconsider previous works and extend that discussion in view of possible quasi - local experiments in space laboratories moving in different gravitational environments .",
    "the basis of our observer - dependent analysis of relative strains is the concept of gravitational compass introduced by szekeres @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and the related discussion about the problem of setting up a preferred frame within which to study the gravitational field . according to szekeres , a gravitational compass consists in an arrangement of three test particles joined by springs to a central observer ; their relative deviation is then investigated via the geodesic deviation equation to deduce the physical significance of the weyl tensor components . at the instant of measurement",
    "the reference particle drops the apparatus observing the strains on the springs .",
    "the relative acceleration between two nearby geodesics is completely determined by the electric part of the riemann tensor , which can be thought of as a symmetric force distribution whose six independent components are the strains on the six springs . when the off diagonal terms ( i.e. the transverse strains ) vanish , the springs connecting the test particles to the observer lie along the principal axes of the tidal force matrix , so that the apparatus maps out the local gravitational field , acting just as a sort of compass .",
    "expressing the riemann tensor in terms of the weyl tensor ( with which coincides in the case of vacuum spacetimes ) allowed szekeres to discuss the physical meaning of the petrov classification .",
    "the electric part of the weyl tensor represents the only direct curvature contribution to the geodesic deviation equation ( as well as the deviation equation for general non - geodesic motion ) , introducing shearing forces due to its property of being symmetric and trace - free .",
    "actually szekeres gravitational compass is only valid to describe an idealized situation . for any practical use , in fact",
    ", it should be replaced by a gravity gradiometer , \" i.e. a device to perform measurements of the local gradient of the tidal gravitational force .",
    "the theory of a relativistic gravity gradiometer has been developed by mashhoon , theiss , paik and will @xcite in view of satellite experiments around the earth in the framework of post - newtonian approximation .",
    "it should also be noted that a modern observational trend is to use atomic interferometry to build the future generation of highly precise gravity gradiometers ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently chicone and mashhoon @xcite obtained a generalized geodesic deviation equation in fermi coordinates as well as in arbitrary coordinates as a taylor expansion in powers of the components of the deviation vector , retaining terms up to first order , but without any restriction on the relative spatial velocities .",
    "they then investigated in a number of papers @xcite the motion of a swarm of free particles ( in both non - relativistic and relativistic regime ) relative to a free reference particle which is on a radial escape trajectory away from a collapsed object ( a schwarzschild as well as a kerr black hole ) , discussing the astrophysical implications of the related ( observer - dependent ) tidal acceleration mechanism .",
    "the further dependence of the deviation equation on the four acceleration of the observer as well as his three velocity has been accounted very recently by mullari and tammelo @xcite .",
    "aim of this work is to set up the necessary assessment to assure stability of extended bodies as they move in a given spacetime , identifying which parts of them should be provided of a more rigid structure to resist tidal or acceleration strains , according to their internal constituency .",
    "in fact we are not concerned here with internal stresses but with the external field of strains generated by the geometrical environment .",
    "special attention will be devoted to type d vacuum stationary axisymmetric spacetimes . in this case",
    ", szekeres analysis suggests that the tidal strains cause the distorsion of a sphere of test free particles about the observer into an ellipsoid , as a typical behaviour of particles falling towards the central attracting body .",
    "we are thus interested in studying how szekeres picture as well as the one associated with the relativistic gravity gradiometry modifies when the acceleration strains are also present , and which frame is most convenient to measure either tidal or inertial forces experienced by an extended body .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we derive the relative acceleration equation and give the ( observer and frame - dependent ) definition of the strain tensor . in section 3",
    "we analyze the strains which affect a bunch of uniformly rotating particles in the flat minkowski spacetime . in section [ kerrcase ]",
    "we discuss instead the deviation acceleration and associated strains in vacuum stationary axisymmetric spacetimes from either geometrically or physically motivated timelike congruences .",
    "in particular we explore the cases of the born - rigid congruence of static observers , of the irrotational family of zero angular momentum observers ( zamos ) , and ( limiting to the schwarzschild and kerr black hole spacetimes ) of the geodesic and irrotational congruence of painlev - gullstrand @xcite orbits .    in what follows",
