    "the casimir effect @xcite is traditionally thought of as a force between electrical conductors caused by the effects of these conducting boundaries on the spectrum of normal modes of the quantized electromagnetic field in the region exterior to the conductors .",
    "( for simplicity when investigating matters of principle , the em field is often replaced by a scalar field , and the boundary conditions of a perfect conductor replaced by the dirichlet condition , @xmath0 . the present work deals with that model . ) crudely , the idea is that each mode acts as a harmonic oscillator with ground - state energy @xmath1 , so that when the energy is summed over all modes of the system , the total vacuum energy is @xmath2 ; then the derivative of @xmath3 with respect to some geometrical parameter of the system constitutes a generalized force , by the `` principle of virtual work '' .",
    "this mode sum is clearly divergent , and its relation to physical realities measured in the laboratory has been somewhat controversial .",
    "formal regularizations , such as the zeta - function method @xcite , usually give answers that are generally accepted as `` correct '' , but their physical logic is unconvincing .",
    "also , when the conductors are regarded as rigid and only their relative positions are allowed to vary , a finite answer for the force ( or energy difference ) can be obtained by sufficiently careful calculations @xcite .",
    "it is generally agreed , however , that the root of the problem is the failure of the idealized notion of a perfect conductor .",
    "a real material does not act like a perfect conductor ( or even a perfect dielectric ) at very high frequencies , and thus nature must provide an ultraviolet ( or high - momentum @xcite ) cutoff .",
    "but the detailed study of a real material is a complicated nonlinear problem of condensed - matter physics , and it is of interest to step back and see if the phenomena can still be modeled , at least qualitatively , entirely within the linear framework of the field alone .",
    "the most common approach is to insert _ ad hoc _ an ultraviolet cutoff to make the integrals over frequency finite .",
    "the simplest choice is an exponential cutoff : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the cutoff parameter , which can also be considered as a wick rotation of the difference of two time coordinates , @xmath6 .",
    "a complementary approach is to calculate expectation values of the local energy density and pressure ( components of the stress tensor : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , etc . ) , from which all the physically interesting quantities are in principle derivable . from local calculations one sees that , once one removes the ubiquitous zero - point energy that is present even for a completely free field , the vacuum energy density at any point away from the boundary is finite even without a cutoff , and infinities in the total energy ( for a region of finite volume ) arise only because the energy density is not integrable near the boundary .",
    "thus this approach significantly elucidates the physical meaning of the divergences .",
    "cutoff and local calculations fit very well together , as both can be based on a green function of the field equation corresponding to the geometry of the system considered ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it was reasonable to expect that keeping @xmath5 nonzero , and comparable ( in natural units ) to an interatomic spacing , would yield an effective model of the casimir effects of a realistic imperfect conductor .",
    "however , when ultraviolet regularization is applied to the stress tensor , it produces formulas for energy density and pressure that are inconsistent with each other @xcite .",
    "the principle of virtual work , or energy - pressure balance , requires that a change in the vacuum energy corresponding to some infinitesimal movement of a boundary of the system be attributable to some vacuum pressure pushing against that boundary . as an example , consider the pressure against a flat wall , @xmath9 this relation does not follow by default from the local energy - momentum conservation law , @xmath10 ( which is satisfied by the expectation values inside the cavity ) .",
    "it instead constrains the equation of state of the quantized field ( cf .",
    "it appears that the principle of virtual work has been disrupted by the regularization method .",
    "pressure balance can be restored by replacing the timelike ultraviolet cutoff by point - splitting in a `` neutral '' direction , one parallel to the wall @xcite , but this is to repair the damage done by one _ ad hoc _ measure by adding another one .",
    "therefore , bouas et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a new kind of model , the _ soft wall _ , wherein the dirichlet boundary is replaced by a smooth , steeply rising potential function . although regularization is still needed , as always in quantum field theory , the pathology of the perfect conductor has been removed in a physically rigorous way .",
    "that is , the departure from ideal conductivity is embodied from the start in a complete and consistent physical theory , rather than imposed _ a posteriori _ by inserting a cutoff into the formal mathematical results of an unrealistic theory .",
    "one has every reason to expect the principle of virtual work to hold ( after renormalization ) in this context .",
    "specifically , @xcite and @xcite , summarized in @xcite , studied a `` power wall '' set at the plane @xmath11 ( see eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) ) .",
    "it models a conducting plate whose thickness is much greater than its skin depth and whose size is large enough that edge effects are negligible .",
    "that project was continued in the thesis @xcite , whose results are reported here with some corrections .",
    "following milton @xcite , we express the components of the vacuum stress - energy tensor in terms of the _ reduced green function _ formed from the solutions of the @xmath12 dependence of the field in the imaginary - frequency regime ( sec .",

    "we use the natural units @xmath21 and in addition choose the unit of length so that the coupling constant implied in eq .",

    "the potential formally approaches @xmath24 which represents a hard wall ( dirichlet boundary condition ) at @xmath25 .",
    "our goal is to understand the ground - state expectation values of energy density and pressure , which will be of significant magnitude only in some interval surrounding the interval @xmath26 .    when eq .",
    "( [ fieldeq ] ) is solved by separation of variables , the dimensions @xmath27 are trivial , and the @xmath12 dependence is given by solutions of @xmath28 as detailed in @xcite . however , following @xcite , we find it more useful to express vacuum expectation values in terms of a reduced green function , built out of solutions of eq ,  ( [ eigeneq ] ) with the sign of the spectral parameter reversed : @xmath29    for each ( positive ) value of @xmath30 or @xmath31 , there are two linearly independent solutions of eq .",

    "the power wall is a promising model of the effects of a boundary on the vacuum state of a quantum field .",
    "it helps to separate the genuine effects from the pathologies associated with idealized boundary conditions .",
    "this paper deals with a flat wall interacting with a scalar field . we have set up a systematic notation for the solutions of the separated field equation and developed useful approximations for them in the limits of large and small imaginary wavenumber @xmath31 , which have been tested numerically . in the region outside the wall",
    ", we obtained approximations for the energy density that closely match the exact solutions in both asymptotic limits and are reasonably accurate in between .",
    "progress in the region inside the wall has been slow , because of both technical problems and the conceptual complication of renormalization in the presence of a nontrivial potential .",
    "the renormalization problem has been investigated separately @xcite for a general potential ; @xcite uses higher - order wkb approximations , with special attention to the application to the power wall .",
    "precise calculation of the renormalized stress tensor , including contributions from the non - wkb region of the spectrum , are in process .    the foremost motivation for this work was to resolve the `` pressure anomaly '' in the force on a perpendicular wall that has been observed @xcite in calculations for a hard wall regularized by a finite cutoff .",
    "outside the soft wall , we have calculated the energy and pressure and shown that the anomaly does not occur in this model .",
    "( eventual success inside the wall is expected . )",
    "we attribute this success to the fact that the soft - wall model is a consistent physical system whose energy density is well behaved from the start , rather than being forced to be finite by an _",
    "ad hoc _ cutoff .",
    "calculations so far ( here and in @xcite ) deal primarily with small values of @xmath22 and hence with the extraneous divergences near @xmath11 caused by the singularity in the potential there . for very large values of @xmath22",
    "these divergences must disappear , and the stress tensor must resemble that of a hard wall near @xmath198 . until such computations are available , it is not meaningful to make a comparison of our results with others , such as those of barton or passante et al .",

    "first to base the analysis of the casimir effect on local quantities ( i.e. , the expectation values of components of the stress tensor ) rather than total energy or force were brown and maclay @xcite .",
    "dewitt @xcite recognized the importance of this topic for understanding quantum field theory in curved space - time .",
    "consequently , the generic behavior of the stress tensor near boundaries was investigated from differing points of view by two groups in austin @xcite ; deutsch and candelas @xcite argued that divergences in the total energy are related to finite and physically meaningful , though nonintegrable , distributions of energy density near the boundary and , therefore , must be taken seriously .",
    "this can be regarded as the origin of the modern program of softening ( not discarding ) surface terms by improved modeling of the boundaries themselves .",
    "later , the analysis of the energy in a box in terms of classical paths by hertzberg et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that energy density near boundaries has physical meaning and can be responsible for counterintuitive signs in some parts of casimir forces .",
    "closer to the spirit of the present work is ford and svaiter s investigation of a hard boundary whose location is subjected to random fluctuations @xcite .",
    "similar work has been done recently by passante et al.@xcite    qualitatively similar results appear in a large number of papers by graham , jaffe , olum , and coworkers ( such as refs .",
    "@xcite ) culminating in the book @xcite .",
    "that program differs from ours superficially by dealing with a high , narrow potential hill ( instead of a one - sided wall ) , and more fundamentally in the choice of calculational methods ( techniques of scattering theory instead of local , differential - equation analyses ) , which results in a rather different point of view .",
    "an earlier paper in that tradition is bordag @xcite .",
    "the present program is rooted in @xcite , which proposed to model a soft wall simply by maintaining a finite ultraviolet cutoff in calculations for a hard wall .",
    "results were qualitatively so similar to those of ford and svaiter @xcite and graham and olum @xcite as to suggest that all the approaches were on the same track .",
    "however , in calculations for a spherical boundary , martin schaden and fulling ( unpublished , but summarized in @xcite ) discovered a pressure anomaly  a violation of eq .",
    "( [ balance ] ) .",
    "detailed examination @xcite showed that this problem existed for flat boundaries also , and that it was related to the direction dependence of vacuum energy as regularized by point - splitting @xcite .",
    "that is the motivation for the study of the soft wall @xcite .",
    "the closest work to ours that we know of in previous literature ( until @xcite and @xcite ) is that of actor and bender @xcite , in which the perfectly reflecting wall is replaced by a harmonic - oscillator potential . that paper was written before the modern critiques of formal renormalization @xcite and the modern emphasis on local quantities ( such as energy density ) .",
    "it deals with total energies calculated by zeta - function regularization .",
    "here we have not reviewed papers on scalar quantum field theory in general background scalar potentials and the resulting issues of renormalization , since that topic relates more to @xcite and possible later papers . nor have we listed the large body of papers on fields interacting with slabs of material ( such as dielectrics ) or delta - function potentials ; such models are not truly `` soft '' by our definition , since boundary divergences remain .",
