    "polygonal classical billiards is an active subject of research in mathematics and physics ( see for review ref.@xcite ) . in view of the null lyapunov exponent and the null kolmogorov metric entropy",
    "the rational polygons , formed by the piece - line billiard boundary with the vertex angles are rational multiplies of @xmath3 , are known to be _ nonchaotic _",
    "systems@xcite . they are therefore well distinct from the sinai billiard@xcite ( sb ) and the bunimovich billiard@xcite ( bb ) where classical _ chaotic _ motion regimes are due to , respectively , _",
    "dispersive  effects _ caused by the circle disk and the squared boundary , and the _ interplay  _ between boundary segments formed by the circle and the square .",
    "meanwhile , the rational polygons of @xmath4 equal sides and equal vertices ( hereafter , the @xmath4-gons@xcite ) revealed@xcite positive lyapunov exponents with increasing of @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , the polygonal billiards exposed chaoticlike changes in the associated quantum - level spectra@xcite , which fluctuations are shown@xcite to be very close to the gaussian orthogonal - ensemble - type statistics . in view of the _ splitting effects _ by the angle vertices , polygons",
    "do not satisfy the conditions of integrability@xcite    these evidences for the chaoticlike features of the nonintegrable rational polygons were recently questioned by mantica@xcite through the orbital complexity analysis . unlike the case of the integrable billiards@xcite , a delicate problem of the interplay between the regular ( piece - line ) and the irregular ( vertex - angle ) boundary segments in polygons can not be solved in terms of the first - order averaged polygonal characteristics , such as the average - orbit coding length@xcite , the mean wall - collision time@xcite , or the average collision number@xcite .",
    "as shown through analysis of the orbit - wall - collision statistics@xcite , the higher order correlation effects induced by vertices play a crucial role in the intrinsic dynamics of @xmath4-gons .",
    "earlier this was experimentally corroborated@xcite through the quantum - level spectra statistics :  unlike the case of the irrational polygons , the long - range level correlation effects are due to the _ rationality _ of vertex angles@xcite . in the case of the curved - by - circle infinite-@xmath4 rational polygon ( @xmath5-gon )",
    "the late - time memory effects arise from the _ sliding orbits_@xcite , which have no analog in the ballistic - type dynamics of its counterpart given by the circle billiard ( hereafter cb ) , where the orbit classification is well established@xcite .",
    "this implies that the quasi - classical approach has no justification for the ",

    "this is in agreement with a conclusion on inapplicability in polygons of the quantum - to - classic correspondence principle .",
    "the latter was elaborated@xcite within the scope of the conventional wentsell - kramer - brillouin picture that failed to establish a one - to - one correspondence between classical orbits and their quantum counterparts .",
    "the issue of the current paper is an investigation of the vertex - splitting effects revealed in the _",
    "decay _ dynamics of finite-@xmath4 rational polygons .",
    "an analysis is given through the survival orbit statistics in the weakly open billiards , which boundaries permit orbits to escape through a small opening .",
    "we will see that , similarly to the case of the intrinsic dynamics in the closed @xmath4-gons@xcite , the vertex - splitting effects are dual of vertex - ordering and vertex - disordering motion effects , that is manifested through , respectively , the orderlike and chaoticlike behavior observed in the late - time relaxation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the recent findings for the decay dynamics in nonchaotic@xcite and chaotic@xcite billiards are given in sec.ii and discussed within concepts of the primary and the secondary relaxation channels .",
    "the weakly open rational polygons are analyzed numerically and analytically in sec.iii for the cases of small and large numbers @xmath4 .",
    "discussion and conclusions are summarized in sec.iv .",
    "the intrinsic dynamics of the closed classical billiards is commonly considered in terms of a temporal decay of the correlation functions for certain dynamical variables ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "pure exponential lost of amount of memory on the initial states is not a unique channel of relaxation even in the chaotic systems ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) . by studying the chaotic billiards , such as the sb@xcite , that is dynamically equivalent to the correspondent lorentz gas ( lg ) model@xcite and the bb@xcite with a stadium geometry , it has been recognized that a crossover from the short - time exponential to the late - time algebraic decay is due to the long - term memory effects on a free regular motion .",
    "the algebraic tail of the correlation functions seems to be vanished only in the case of the fully hyperbolic systems correspondent to such geometries as the finite - horizon sb@xcite ( equivalent to the high - density lg ) or the diamond@xcite .",
    "qualitatively the same can be referred to the _",
    "decay dynamics _ in weakly open billiards that describes a crossover from a bounded to unbounded orbit free motion .",
    "such a decay dynamics is initially established by uniformly distributed @xmath7 point particles ( of unit mass and unit velocity ) moving inside of the closed planar billiard table and then allowing to escape through a small opening of width @xmath8 .",
    "a temporal behavior of the dynamic observables can be scaled to the characteristic billiard times , namely @xmath9 here the _",
    "mean collision time_@xcite @xmath10 and by the _",
    "mean escape time_@xcite @xmath11 are introduced through the accessible area @xmath12 and the perimeter @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) for a given billiard table .",
    "the late - time ( @xmath15 ) algebraic - type evolution of non - escaped orbits ( or particles ) @xmath16 , which time derivation is related to the _ survival probability _ , is definitely characterized by the _ decay _ _ dynamic exponent _ @xmath17 .    in the integrable _ nonchaotic _ billiards , the first observation of the algebraic decay with exponents @xmath18 was given@xcite for the case of the square billiard .",
    "recent study of the decay dynamics in the @xmath19gon revealed@xcite two distinct channels of the algebraic - type slow relaxation .",
    "the first one is due to the regular - orbit motion with the decay dynamic exponent @xmath1 , and the second channel is originated from the  irregular  orbits induced by the singular vertex - spliting effects , which give rise to the subdiffusion motion regime indicated@xcite by @xmath20 .",
    "such a kind of diverse dynamical behavior was observed through the _",
    "survival orbit spectra _ defined by a number for the survived orbits and simulated in the integrable cb and in the almost - integrable@xcite square billiard ( see , respectively , figs .",
    "5,6 and 3,4 in ref.@xcite ) . in both the cases",
    "an irregularlike motion is due to orbit families known as , respectively , the  whispering - gallery  ( polygonlike ) and",
    "the  bouncing - ball  orbits .",
    "meanwhile , in the late - time decay of the cb ( see inserts in figs . 3,4 and 5,6 in ref.@xcite ) the short - time living , frequently escaped  whispering - gallery ",
    "orbits , unlike the nonintegrable case , did not contribute to the second channel of relaxation .",
    "thus , the solely exponent @xmath1 was observed in the cb .    in",
    "the _ chaotic _ closed and weakly open ( including hamiltonian ) classical systems , presented by the bb@xcite , the infinite - horizon sb@xcite , and by the low - density lg model@xcite , the algebraic - type decay was numerically revealed@xcite by the dynamic exponents @xmath21 . similarly to the nonchaotic case , it has been repeatedly recognized that the algebraic tail is caused by the  arbitrary long segments  observed in the evolution of stochastic orbits@xcite , or by the regularlike orbit motion due to  sticking particles  @xcite .",
    "this implies that in both the cases this relaxation is due to a free motion of the corresponding trajectories in the infinite ( with respect to the observation time ) distinct",
    "_  corridors _ which are open in the relevant phase space@xcite .",
    "the algebraic - type relaxation channel with @xmath1 ( @xmath22 ) established in the chaotic@xcite as well as in nonchaotic@xcite billiards , seems to be generic for all non - fully hyperbolic systems with smooth convex boundaries .",
    "its independence of the billiard space dimension@xcite , its insensitiveness to details of the boundary shape@xcite , including that to a position of the small opening@xcite , and to the initial conditions@xcite , suggests that the late - time @xmath23-relaxation arise in classical systems as the _ universal primary relaxation_. the latter is a part of the two - step relaxation scenario discussed in the chaotic@xcite and nonchaotic@xcite weekly open classical systems .",
    "universal scenario _ was introduced by the short - time pure exponential and by the first - power - algebraic overall orbit decays given by @xmath24 with @xmath25 , and by @xmath26 with @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "meanwhile the real relaxation does not exclude the existence of the additional intermediate _ transient _ _ regimes _ approximated by the stretched - exponential form@xcite with @xmath27 ( earlier discussed for chaotic billiards in analytical@xcite and numerical@xcite forms ) , and by other algebraic - decay forms@xcite with @xmath28 .",
    "the escape mechanism of the primary relaxation in the chaotic and nonchaotic billiards was described in details within a coarse - grained approximation ( see , respectively , eq.(12 ) in ref.@xcite and eq.(15 ) in ref.@xcite ) . unlike the case of the primary relaxation , the temporal observation conditions ( observation windows ) for the _ secondary relaxation _ in the chaotic billiards ( @xmath29 ) are shown to be very sensitive to the billiard geometry@xcite , to the dimension@xcite @xmath30 of a billiard table , and to the initial conditions@xcite .",
    "this can be exemplified by the dynamic - exponent constraint @xmath31 proposed in ref.@xcite and observed in the chaotic bb@xcite and sb@xcite billiards .",
    "the algebraic - type decay of correlations in the low - density _ chaotic _ lg is due to evolution of trajectories within the infinite principal and/or  hindered ",
    "open corridors@xcite . in the corresponding disk - dispersing sb ( of side @xmath32 and disk radius @xmath33 ) with the infinite - horizon geometry ( @xmath34 ) the principal and the  hindered  corridors , respectively , can be governed by the limiting disk radii@xcite @xmath35 and @xmath36 and observed through the established@xcite algebraic - tail temporal windows .",
    "thus , the primary relaxation was observed@xcite within the domain @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 , when the  hindered  corridors are closed@xcite . under the geometric conditions @xmath40 @xmath41 the transient @xmath42-relaxation channel",
    "was activated and indicated by the decay dynamic exponents @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "one can see that the primary and the secondary relaxation channels can be geometrically associated with blehers@xcite principal and  hindered  corridors , respectively .",
    "the latter case was additionally characterized@xcite as a _ superdiffusive _ motion regime , observed earlier in the chaotic@xcite and very recently in the polygonal@xcite closed billiards .",
    "we see that non - fully hyperbolic billiards , on one hand , are indiscernible within decay dynamics observed through the primary universal @xmath23-relaxation channel . on the other hand , the chaotic and nonchaotic , the open and closed",
    "billiards are well distinguished with respect to the secondary @xmath45-relaxation given by the decay dynamic exponents @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively . in what follows",
    "we give numerical and analytical analysis of the conditions of stabilization of both the primary and secondary relaxation channels in the weakly open rational polygonal billiards .",
    "we deal with the rational polygons _  _ of @xmath4 equal sides , denominated as @xmath4-gons , circumscribed below a circle of radius @xmath33 .",
    "the mean collision time @xmath48 and the mean escape time @xmath49 are given with the help of eq.([tau / ec ] ) through area @xmath50 and perimeter @xmath51 . in the limit @xmath6 one",
    "naturally arrives at the circle geometry of the @xmath5-gon with the mean times @xmath52 and @xmath53 , both characteristic of the cb .",
    "this demonstrates how the first - order dynamic characteristics can be introduced through the aforementioned geometrical correspondence that takes place between the @xmath5-gon and the cb .",
    "meanwhile the dynamical correspondence does not exist@xcite because the vertex - memory effects violate commutation between of the temporal ( @xmath54 ) and spatial ( @xmath6 ) limits .      similarly to the closed @xmath4-gons@xcite ,",
    "let us consider the case of small number of vertices , with @xmath55 , within the scope of the deterministic approach .",
    "this is given by generalization of the regular - orbit description introduced@xcite for the particular case of @xmath56 and is straightforwardly based on the fact that the wall - collision angles @xmath57 ( counted off the normal to the boundary and preserved by elastic refections ) are integrals of motion .",
    "this is true for the integrable billiards where dispersing or splitting effects are absent .",
    "a dynamic description of the regular - orbit motion can be introduced with accounting of the fact that @xmath4 ( or @xmath58 ) sides of a given @xmath4-gon , with odd ( or even ) number of vertices , are dynamically equivalent@xcite .",
    "a description of the wall - collision statistics can be therefore reduced to the collision - angle domain @xmath59 $ ] with @xmath60 in turn , the @xmath57-family regular ",
    "orbit sets can be introduced ( for details see appendix ) through the characteristic collision times , namely @xmath61 the collision time @xmath62 is related to the billiard mean collision time @xmath63 through the ",
    "mean - collision - time ",
    "equation , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath64 @xmath63 .",
    "the latter is equivalent to the known@xcite  mean - free - path  equation considered in the uniformly populated two - dimensional ( @xmath65 ) _",
    "subspace @xmath66 ( see also eqs.(3,4 ) in ref.@xcite ) the @xmath67 phase space @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath57-set - orbit distribution function @xmath69 is defined here as @xmath70 by generalization of eqs.(6,7 ) in ref.@xcite .",
    "we discuss the late - time ( @xmath71 ) survival dynamics in a given @xmath4-gon through the @xmath57-set - orbit decay spectra defined by numbers of the survived orbits @xmath72 and by corresponding overall numbers @xmath73 . here a procedure of averaging over collisions , denoted by @xmath74 , is introduced through the aforesaid ",
    "mean - collision - time  equation .",
    "the universal relaxation channel , associated solely with the regular orbits , is given through numbers of the nonescaped orbits , namely @xmath75 which are the late - time solutions of the relevant decay - kinetics master equation ( see eqs .",
    "( 16,17 ) in ref.@xcite ) . as seen from eq.([nt ] ) , the fundamental characteristics @xmath76 @xmath77 and @xmath78 are common for both the decay and intrinsic dynamics .",
    "the @xmath79-set orbit - partial weight @xmath80 and the orbit - overall weight @xmath81 of the corresponding algebraic tails can be established in explicit form within a certain coarse - grained scheme and directly observed@xcite .",
    "however an interesting analysis that indicates a departure of @xmath4-gons from the true integrable systems due to vertices can be given through the algebraic - tail weights without detail calculations .    by taking into account the mentioned equation @xmath82",
    ", the overall regular - orbit - decay weight @xmath83 immediately follows from eq.([nt ] ) .",
    "the validity of this relation can be straightforwardly tested for the integrable cb where the irregular orbits do not survive in the late - time relaxation . indeed , in this case @xmath84 and @xmath85 that follows from the observation ( see tab.2 in ref.@xcite ) of the primary relaxation of the collision space @xmath86",
    ". one can see that the algebraic - tail parametrization of the regular - orbit decay effects in the cb is self - consistent that is experimentally justified with a high precision , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath87 . in the case of polygons , a violation of the relations @xmath88 and @xmath89",
    "is expected in view of the long - living irregular - orbit motion induced by vertex - splitting effects .",
    "we have performed numerical experiments@xcite on decay dynamics in @xmath4-gons with small number of vertices : @xmath90 . the initial particles ( @xmath91 )",
    "have been distributed randomly within the two distinct phase spaces described in eq.([f - spaces ] ) and then allowed to escape through a small opening @xmath92 . the condition @xmath93 ( @xmath94 )",
    "is chosen to be common for all @xmath4 and that has been provided with the accuracy of @xmath95 with the help of eq.([tau / ec ] ) . in all cases of @xmath96",
    "the typical algebraic decay is observed@xcite within a certain temporal windows given by , approximately , @xmath97 .",
    "the particular cases of the observed decay spectra for pentagon and heptagon are exemplified in * fig.1*. in general , the overall - orbit late - time decay in @xmath4-gons with small number of vertices do not show noticeable deviations from the linear relaxation@xcite ( see the left insert in fig.1 ) .",
    "thus the partial weights @xmath98 are derived from the observed numbers @xmath99 through eq.([nt ] ) with accounting of the estimated distribution function @xmath77 and the collision times @xmath62 given in , respectively , eqs.([fi - m ] ) and ( [ tc - m ] ) .",
    "these equations were additionally experimentally tested@xcite ( _ e.g. _ see the right insert in fig.1 ) .    as seen from fig.1 , the observed partial weights @xmath98 exhibit regular ( small ) and irregular ( large ) deviations from the mean magnitude @xmath100 shown by a solid ( horizontal ) line .",
    "the latter and the regular - orbit weights @xmath101 ( evaluated with regardless of the large isolated peaks ) are accumulated in * table.1*. through analysis of a difference between the overall and partial weights @xmath102 , one can see with the help of table 1 that , similarly to the case of the intrinsic dynamics ( see fig.2 in ref.@xcite ) , the vertex - splitting effects in the even - gons are more pronounced than those in the odd - gons . in all the @xmath4-gon cases",
    "a deviation of the total weights , treated as @xmath103 ( with @xmath104 and @xmath105 given in table 1 ) , exceeds experimental error ( @xmath106 ) established above for the integrable sb , and we therefore infer that @xmath107 .",
    "this implies that the irregular - orbit motion is involved into the observed relaxation . on the other hand ,",
    "no noticeable deviation from the primary relaxation is indicated in the observed decay - orbit dynamics when @xmath96 .",
    "similarly to the case of the intrinsic dynamics observed@xcite in the @xmath4-gons with small number of vertices , we deduce that the regular - orbit motion dominates in the late - time decay dynamics .",
    "the universal two - step relaxation in open billiards is shared by @xmath4-gons with arbitrary number of vertices@xcite . in * figs . 2 *  and * 3 * we analyze our numerical results for the late - time overall - orbit decay dynamics in the @xmath4-gons with large number ( @xmath108 with @xmath109 ) of vertices for the cases of relatively small and large opening widths . in general",
    ", one can observe that the decay dynamics of the rational polygons with increasing of number of sides moves away from that given by the geometrically corresponding cb : the chaotic effects , manifested by the secondary relaxation channel with @xmath46 , become more pronounced with number of vertices . as seen from the observed relaxation of the initially equivalent states ( given in phase spaces @xmath110 and @xmath111 ) is qualitatively distinct , and the _ open _ @xmath5-gon and the cb are not therefore dynamically equivalent .",
    "moreover , the @xmath4-gons with @xmath112 do not expose the algebraic decay with @xmath113 , characteristic for _ subdiffusive _ motion regimes in nonchaotic open systems observed@xcite in @xmath19-gon .    in the particular case of @xmath114 shown in fig .",
    ", the universal relaxation remains stable until @xmath115 , but when @xmath116 the primary relaxation channel turns up to be closed .",
    "in other words , the regular - orbit - motion relaxation affected by vertices is transformed into the irregularlike - motion relaxation indicated by dynamic exponent @xmath43 .",
    "qualitatively the same follows from fig . 3 , but the upper limit for the @xmath23-channel observation window shows its dependence on @xmath8 , _",
    "@xmath117 for @xmath118 .",
    "thus bleher s principal corridors of the regular - motion relaxations are open for @xmath119 ( similarly to the case of the sb given by @xmath37 @xmath120 @xmath39 that is discussed in sec.ii ) when the vertex - splitting ( or disk - dispersing effects ) are weak@xcite .",
    "we see that the @xmath23-relaxation ( @xmath121 ) occurs as a precursor of the @xmath42-relaxation regime , realized for @xmath122 , just as in the chaotic sb case the @xmath42-relaxation ( @xmath40 @xmath41 ) was observed@xcite before the @xmath23-relaxation ( @xmath37 @xmath120 @xmath39 ) .",
    "conversely , the observed @xmath23-to-@xmath42-relaxation crossover in the @xmath4-gons , induced by the interplay between the piece - line regular and the vertex - angle singular boundaries , is similar to that between the semi - square and semi - circle parts of the stadium boundary .",
    "the latter was deduced@xcite in the case of the bb with small ( @xmath123 ) and large ( @xmath124 ) opening widths , with the observed exponents @xmath125 ( see table 1 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "qualitatively , the effect of closing of the principal corridors in a given @xmath126-gon can be understood by difficulties , increasing with @xmath4 , to draw the long segments of free motion , which intersect the polygonal sides in the correspondent lg lattice but avoid the vertex angles ( see also discussion in appendix ) .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath42-relaxation revealed in figs .",
    "2 , 3 is associated with stabilization of the  irregular-type trajectories , which are effectively deviated by vertex angles .",
    "more precisely , the observed order - to - chaoticlike crossover can be understood as a regular - to - irregular orbit transformation of the aforesaid sliding orbits ( formed@xcite by @xmath127 -sets with characteristic free - path times @xmath128 following from eq.([tc - m ] ) ) , which survive in the open @xmath4-gons with @xmath129 , into those , renormalized substantially by vertex angles , called@xcite by _ vortexlike _ orbits ( with the large , but finite mean characteristic time @xmath130 ) , which expected to be stable for @xmath131 . within this context , the survival conditions of the regular ( sliding ) and the irregular ( vortexlike ) orbits driven , respectively , by piece - line and vertex - angle parts of the open polygonal boundary , can be introduced as follows . on one hand , the favorable observation conditions for the @xmath23-relaxation ( or the @xmath42-relaxation ) should ensure to exclude ( or to include ) the vertex - angle effects under the constraint @xmath129 ( or @xmath132 ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the weakly open ( @xmath133 ) @xmath4-gon of a side length @xmath134 , the survival conditions for the regular sliding or irregular vortexlike orbits are satisfied by geometric constraints , respectively , @xmath135 or @xmath136 .",
    "hence , the @xmath23-@xmath42-relaxation crossover , observed at @xmath137 , is ensured by the condition @xmath138 . with taking into account that perimeter in the polygons with large number of sides is well approximated by @xmath139 ,",
    "one arrives at the desirable criterium @xmath140 this finding provides the estimates @xmath141 and @xmath142 for the particular cases of @xmath143 and @xmath144 realized in figs . 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "we infer that unlike the case of the closed polygons@xcite , the vertex - splitting effects in the open @xmath4-gons with large number of vertices give rise to stabilization of the vortexlike - orbit motion .",
    "the mild discontinues caused by vertex angles and relative lengths of the edges is the central problem of the intrinsic dynamics of the  almost integrable  polygonal billiards commonly discussed@xcite in terms of the orbit ergodicity , mixing , entropy , coding , complexity@xcite , pseudo - integrability@xcite , spectral level statistics@xcite , and the orbit collision statistics@xcite .",
    "the problem is now addressed to the decay dynamics in the @xmath4-gons and is discussed through the orbit survival probability @xmath145 related to the number of the survived orbits @xmath146 .",
    "the decay spectra given by the @xmath79-set regular - orbit numbers @xmath72 , are also studied for the case of small number of vertices @xmath4 .    a general approach to the decay problem based on a simple decay kinetic equation@xcite naturally arrives at the primary slow relaxation of the regular - orbit sets given by @xmath147 ( see eq.([nt ] ) ) .",
    "we have demonstrated that the universal @xmath23-channel , attributed for both the chaotic@xcite and nonchaotic@xcite billiards , is also characteristic of nonintegrable rational polygons .",
    "the primary relaxation - motion regime originated from the piece - line parts of the polygonal table is associated with long - living sliding orbits with large collision angles @xmath57 . in the corresponding phase space",
    "these orbits are unbounded trajectories ( see * fig.4 * ) that move without splitting at angle vertices along bleher s principal corridors .",
    "following to the simplest polygonal orbit classification by gutkin@xcite , the regular sliding - orbit sets can be presented by the  infinite - past - to - infinite - future  trajectories .",
    "they  never  hit vertices , preserve the initial linear momenta , and show a regular behavior in the orbit decay spectra @xmath72 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "conversely , the singular orbit sets caused by the  infinite - past - to - vertex  , the  vertex - to - infinite - future  , and the diagonal  vertex - to - vertex  trajectories@xcite exhibit pronounced weights @xmath80 in the orbit - decay process ( shown by high peaks in fig.1 ) . eventually , they do not play any significant role in the wall - collision statistics in @xmath4-gons with small number of vertices limited by , approximately , @xmath148 , and thus the primary relaxation dominates .",
    "this corroborates by our numerical study ( analyzed in table 1and fig.1 ) and , in general , is in accord with studies of the closed polygons by the orbit - wall collision statistics@xcite and by the orbit complexity@xcite .",
    "when the number of vertices is large , the secondary relaxation with the survival probability @xmath149 predominates over the primary relaxation ( see figs .",

    "qualitatively , the survival probability function @xmath151 can be associated with the distribution function for trajectories trapped by the strange attractors , discussed in the theory of the open classical chaotic systems , or with the corresponding waiting - time probability function@xcite . with accounting of findings for the decay dynamics on the sb by fendrik s group@xcite",
    ", one can expect that the secondary relaxation is due to the _ singular trapped _",
    "orbit sets that move freely along bleher s ",

    "the observation conditions for the secondary relaxation in rational polygons are sensitive to the initial conditions and to the geometrical constrains .",

    "as shown , this criterium meets the favorable survival conditions for the regular - motion regime with those induced by rationality of the vortices .",
    "the latter are generated by the sliding orbits through the vertex-ordering  effects and are associated with the vortexlike orbits@xcite . as follows from eq.([m - alfa ] ) , the observation window of such a motion disappears in the limit @xmath155 , when the vortexlike orbits do not survive in the closed polygons ( see fig.2 in ref.@xcite ) .",
