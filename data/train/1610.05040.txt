    "the discovery of the higgs boson has marked the completion of the sm particle content .",
    "however , observations in particle physics , astrophysics , and cosmology point to the existence of particles and interactions beyond the sm .",

    "remarkably , problems _ 1)-3 ) _ are solved in the neutrino minimal sm ( @xmath5msm )  @xcite : a minimal extension of the sm by three right - handed singlet neutrinos @xmath0 , having dirac masses @xmath6 arising from yukawa couplings @xmath7 with the higgs ( @xmath8 ) and lepton ( @xmath9 ) doublets , as well as explicit majorana masses @xmath10 , @xmath11\\ , , \\label{yuk_numsm}\\ ] ] ( in weyl spinor notation ) . in the seesaw limit , @xmath12 , the neutrino mass spectrum splits into a light set given by the eigenvalues @xmath13 of the matrix @xmath14 , with the eigenstates corresponding mainly to mixings of the active left - handed neutrinos @xmath15 , and a heavy set given by the eigenvalues @xmath16 of the matrix @xmath10 , with the eigenstates corresponding to mixings of the sterile right - handed neutrinos @xmath0 .",
    "1 ) _ is thus solved by the usual seesaw type - i mechanism .",
    "intriguingly , problems _ 2 ) _ and _ 3 ) _ can be solved simultaneously if @xmath17kev and @xmath18gev .",
    "in fact , in this case @xmath19 create flavored lepton asymmetries from cp - violating oscillations in the early universe which are crucial for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe via flavored leptogenesis and of the lightest sterile neutrino @xmath20  the dark matter candidate of the @xmath5msm  by the msw effect .",
    "moreover , it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that also problem _ 4 ) _ can be solved in the @xmath5msm by allowing a non - minimal coupling of the higgs field to the ricci scalar , @xmath21 , which promotes the higgs field to an inflaton candidate .",
    "however , the success of the @xmath5msm as a minimal model of particle cosmology is threatened by several facts .",
    "first of all , recent findings in astrophysics have seriously constrained the parameter space for @xmath20 as a dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "secondly , the large value of the non - minimal coupling @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the higgs self - coupling , required to fit the amplitude of the scalar perturbations inferred from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature fluctuations , imply that perturbative unitarity breaks down at the scale @xmath24gev , well below the scale of inflation , @xmath25gev , making the inflationary predictions unreliable @xcite .",
    "thirdly , higgs inflation can not be realised at all if the higgs quartic coupling @xmath23 runs negative at large ( planckian ) field values due to the corrections from top quark loops .",
    "although , given the current experimental uncertainties , a definite conclusion can not yet be drawn , see e.g.  @xcite , the presently favoured central values of the strong gauge coupling and the higgs and top quark masses imply that @xmath23 becomes negative at a field value corresponding to an energy scale @xmath26 gev , much lower than what is required for higgs inflation , and is thus inconsistent with it .",
    "these three obstacles of the @xmath5msm are circumvented in smash - an extension of the sm which features the axion , the type - i seesaw and higgs portal inflation @xcite - as we will review in these proceedings .",
    "the sm particle content is extended not only by three right - handed singlet neutrinos @xmath0 , but also by a vector - like color - triplet quark @xmath1 , as in the ksvz @xcite model .",
    "the sm quarks and leptons as well as the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are assumed to be charged under a global lepton number and pq @xmath2 symmetry @xcite which is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value @xmath27 of a sm - singlet complex scalar field @xmath4 .",
    "the most general scalar potential reads @xmath28 while the most general yukawa couplings of the new fields are given by @xmath29\\ , .",
    "\\label{lyukseesaw}\\ ] ]    after @xmath2 symmetry breaking the sterile neutrinos @xmath0 , the particle excitation @xmath30 of the modulus of the @xmath4 field , and the exotic quark @xmath1 get large masses @xmath31gev : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 . therefore , as far as physics around the electroweak scale or below is concerned , these heavy particles can be integrated out ( unless one considers tiny yukawa and self couplings ) .",
    "the corresponding low - energy lagrangian of smash is identical to that of the sm , augmented by seesaw - generated neutrino masses , @xmath35 , and mixing ( thus solving problem _ 1 ) _ ) , plus one new particle : the particle excitation @xmath36 of the angular degree of freedom of the complex @xmath4 field  the nambu - goldstone boson of the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the @xmath2 , which is dubbed  axion \" in the literature dealing with the pq solution of the strong cp problem @xcite and  majoron \" in the literature dealing with the spontaneous breaking of a global lepton symmetry .",
    "integrating out the exotic quark induces an anomalous coupling of the axion field to the topological charge density in qcd , @xmath37 , promoting the axion field to a dynamical theta parameter , @xmath38 , which relaxes to zero in the vacuum , @xmath39 , thereby solving problem _ 5)_. while the strong cp problem is solved for any value of the axion decay constant @xmath40 , the dark matter will be comprised by axions only if @xmath41 is around @xmath42gev , as we will see later . in this case , the axion mass is predicted to be around @xmath43 @xcite .    , and the modulus of @xmath4 , @xmath30 , all in units of @xmath44 , for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , supporting mixed higgs - hidden - scalar inflation along one of the valleys .",

    "[ fig : inflation ] ( middle ) .",
    "importantly , for ( h)hsi , the effective self - coupling @xmath57 is a free parameter and therefore can be chosen small , @xmath58 , such that the required non - minimal coupling to fit the amplitude of primordial scalar perturbations is of order unity , @xmath59 , cf .",

    "importantly , the higgs portal term @xmath62 in the scalar potential helps to ensure absolute stability in the higgs direction via the threshold stabilisation mechanism pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "we have found that stability can be achieved if the threshold parameter @xmath63 is between @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "instabilities could also originate in the @xmath4 direction , due to quantum corrections from the right - handed neutrinos @xmath0 and the exotic quark @xmath1 .",
    "stability in the @xmath4 direction then restricts their yukawas to @xmath66 .     before standard matter and cosmological constant domination epochs @xcite.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "both in ( h)hsi , slow - roll inflation ends at a value of @xmath67 , where the effect of @xmath68 is negligible and the inflaton starts to undergo hubble - damped oscillations in a quartic potential , with the universe expanding as in a radiation - dominated era , which lasts until reheating , cf .",
    "[ fig : history ] .",
    "after the latter , radiation domination continues , though driven by a bath of relativistic particles .",
    "this fixes the thick red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : inflation ] ( middle ) as the prediction for @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath50 in smash .",
    "the fluctuations of @xmath4 grow fast due to parametric resonance while the inflaton background oscillates in its quartic potential , leading to a rapid restoration of the pq symmetry after about 14 oscillations .",
    "the following reheating stage differs considerably for hsi and hhsi . in the former ,",
    "the large induced particle masses quench inflaton decays or annihilations into sm particles , resulting in a low reheating temperature , @xmath69gev , such that the produced relativistic axions are never thermalized .",
    "correspondingly , hsi predicts a significant amount of cosmic axion background radiation ( cab ) : an increase @xmath70 of the effective number of relativistic neutrino species beyond the sm value @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "this disvafors hsi , since the current results from cmb and baryon acoustic oscillations yield @xmath72 at 68% cl and thus do not allow an additional contribution of order one @xcite .",
    "for this reason , inflation in smash must be of hhsi type , and therefore the inflaton contains a ( small ) higgs component .",
    "the latter allows for efficient reheating of the universe by the production of sm gauge bosons . the reheating temperature in this case is predicted to be around @xmath73gev .",
    "such temperature ensures a thermal restoration of the pq symmetry for the relevant region of parameter space , since the critical temperature @xmath74 of the pq phase transition goes as @xmath75 .",
    "a thermal background of axions is produced at this stage which later decouples and results in a moderate cab corresponding to @xmath76 , a prediction which may be checked in a future cmb polarisation experiment .",
    "dark matter is produced in smash by the re - alignment mechanism  @xcite and the decay of topological defects ( axion strings and domain walls ) @xcite . in order to account for all of the cold dark matter in the universe ,",
    "the pq symmetry breaking scale is predicted to be in the range @xmath77 , corresponding to an axion mass in the range @xmath78 @xcite . here",
    ", the uncertainty originates mainly from the difficulty in predicting the relative importance of the two main production mechanisms of axionic dark matter , i.e. re - alignment and topological defect decay .",
    "importantly , the axion dark matter mass window will be probed in the upcoming decade by axion dark matter direct detection experiments such as cultask , madmax , and orpheus .",
    "the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe is explained in smash by thermal leptogenesis @xcite . in hhsi , after reheating and thermal pq restoration , the rh neutrinos become massive and at least the lightest rh neutrino @xmath20 will retain an equilibrium abundance .",
    "however the stability bound on @xmath79gev , for a hierarchical @xmath0 spectrum ( @xmath80 ) , is just borderline compatible with vanilla leptogenesis from the decays of @xmath20 , which demands @xmath81 gev @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , leptogenesis can occur with a mild resonant enhancement @xcite for a less hierarchical rh neutrino spectrum , which relaxes the stability bound and ensures that all the rh neutrinos remain in equilibrium after the phase transition .",
