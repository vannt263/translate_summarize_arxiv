    "let @xmath0 be an orientable surface of finite type , i.e. a surface of genus @xmath1 with @xmath2 marked points , usually referred to as punctures .",
    "the mapping class group of @xmath0 consists of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms which preserve the punctures , modulo those isotopic to the identity .",
    "thurston @xcite showed that all elements of the mapping class group are periodic , reducible or pseudo - anosov . in this paper",
    "we show that a random walk on the mapping class group gives rise to a pseudo - anosov element with asymptotic probability one .",
    "in fact we obtain a more general result which we now describe .",
    "let @xmath3 be a probability distribution on the mapping class group @xmath4 .",
    "a random walk on @xmath4 is a markov chain on @xmath4 with transition probabilities given by left translation of @xmath3 , i.e. the probability that you go from @xmath5 at time @xmath6 , to @xmath7 at time @xmath8 , is @xmath9 , and we shall assume that we start at the identity at time zero .",
    "the path space for the random walk is the probability space @xmath10 , where the product @xmath11 is the collection of all sample paths , and the measure @xmath12 is determined by @xmath3 . if @xmath13 is a sample path , then we will write @xmath14 for the location of the sample path at time @xmath6 , and the distribution of @xmath14 is given by the @xmath6-fold convolution of @xmath3 .",
    "the support of the random walk is the semi - group generated by the support of @xmath3 .",
    "we shall always assume that the group generated by the support of @xmath3 is a non - elementary subgroup of the mapping class group , i.e. it contains a pair of elements with distinct fixed points in @xmath15 .",
    "the mapping class group is finitely generated , so a choice of ( finite ) generating set gives rise to a word metric on the group , where the length of an element is the shortest length of any word in the generators equal to the group element , and two different choices of finite generating sets give quasi - isometric word metrics .",
    "we may also consider the word metric on the mapping class group with respect to an infinite generating set , though in this case the resulting metric need not be proper , and is often referred to as a relative metric .",
    "masur and minsky @xcite have shown that there is a choice of infinite generating set , consisting of a finite generating set union a particular collection of subgroups , which gives rise to a metric which is @xmath16-hyperbolic . in this case , we say that the mapping class group is weakly relatively hyperbolic .",
    "in fact , the mapping class group with this particular relative metric is quasi - isometric to the complex of curves .",
    "this gives two different ways to measure lengths of elements of the mapping class group , as we can measure their length using word length with respect to a finite generating set , or we can measure their length in the relative metric . the relative length of a group element is its distance from the identity in the relative metric . we show that @xmath14 is conjugate to an element of bounded relative length with asymptotic probability zero , i.e. the probability that @xmath14 is conjugate to an element of bounded relative length tends to zero as @xmath6 tends to infinity .",
    "[ theorem : rw ] consider a random walk on the mapping class group of an orientable surface of finite type , which is not a sphere with three or fewer punctures , and let @xmath14 be the location of the random walk after @xmath6 steps .",
    "if the group generated by the support of the random walk is non - elementary , then for any constant @xmath17 , @xmath14 is conjugate to an element of relative length at most @xmath17 with asymptotic probability zero .",
    "there is a constant @xmath17 , depending on the surface , such that any mapping class group element which is not is conjugate to an element of relative length at most @xmath17 , as shown in lemma [ lemma : bounded length ] , and so this implies that @xmath14 is pseudo - anosov with asymptotic probability one .",
    "rivin @xcite and kowalski @xcite have also shown that the nearest neighbour random walk on the mapping class group gives rise to a pseudo - anosov element with asymptotic probability one , as part of a broader investigation of random walks on groups .",
    "their methods apply whenever the support of the random walk maps onto @xmath18 , and have the advantage that they may be used to construct explicit lower bounds for the proportion of elements which are pseudo - anosov at time @xmath6 , and furthermore , show that the set of elements is transient for these random walks .",
    "however , our methods apply to random walks supported on more general subgroups of the mapping class group .",
    "for example , the torelli group is the subgroup of the mapping class group which acts trivially on the homology of the surface .",
    "this is a normal subgroup whose limit set is dense in the thurston boundary , and so is not contained in a non - trivial centralizer .",
    "therefore the nearest neighbour random walk on a cayley graph for the torelli group gives rise to a pseudo - anosov element with asymptotic probability one .",
    "we now give an outline of the main argument .",
    "let @xmath19 be a set of elements in the mapping class group which are all conjugate to elements of bounded relative length , for example all of the non - elements of the mapping class group .",
    "the basic idea is to consider the distribution of elements of @xmath19 inside the mapping class group , and show that random walks end up travelling through regions in which the density of elements of @xmath19 tends to zero .",
    "the long time behaviour of random walks in the mapping class group is described by harmonic measure on @xmath15 , the space of projective measured laminations .",
    "this space may be thought of as a boundary for the mapping class group , following work of masur and minsky @xcite and klarreich @xcite , and we make this precise in section [ section : random ] . by work of kaimanovich and masur @xcite , sample paths",
    "converge to the boundary with probability one , and this gives rise to a measure on @xmath15 , called harmonic measure .",
    "the measure of a subset of the boundary is the probability that a sample path will converge to a lamination lying in that set , and this measure depends on the choice of probability distribution @xmath3 used to define the random walk . given a subset @xmath20 of the mapping class group , we can take the harmonic measure of its limit set @xmath21 in @xmath15 .",
    "a sample path of the random walk is recurrent on @xmath20 if it hits @xmath20 infinitely often .",
    "if a sample path is recurrent on @xmath20 , and it converges to the boundary , then it converges to a point in @xmath21 . as sample paths converge to the boundary with probability one , this means that the probability that a sample path is recurrent on @xmath20 is a lower bound on the harmonic measure of @xmath21 . in particular , if the harmonic measure of the limit set is zero , then the random walk is transient on @xmath20 , i.e. a sample path hits @xmath20 only finitely many times with probability one .    in general the limit set of @xmath19 need not have harmonic measure zero , for example the set of all elements of the mapping class group which are not pseudo - anosov has a limit set consisting of all of @xmath15 , and so has harmonic measure one .",
    "however , we can consider @xmath22 , the set of all the elements in @xmath19 which are word length distance ( not relative distance ) at most @xmath23 from some other element of @xmath19 .",
    "we show that the limit set of @xmath22 is contained in the union of the limit sets of the centralizers of elements of the mapping class group of length at most @xmath23 .",
    "we then show that this set has harmonic measure zero , assuming that the group @xmath24 generated by the support of the random walk is non - elementary , and every non - trivial element has a centralizer which has infinitely many images under @xmath24 .",
    "each element of @xmath25 lives inside a ball of elements not in @xmath19 of radius at least @xmath23 , and so there is an upper bound for the probability that a sample path hits an element of @xmath25 .",
    "this bound tends to zero as @xmath23 tends to infinity , so the probability that a sample path is not pseudo - anosov tends to zero as the length of the path tends to infinity .",
    "finally , if there are centralizers with finitely many images under the group @xmath24 generated by the support of the random walk , we show that we can map @xmath24 to the mapping class group of a surface covered by @xmath0 , whose mapping class group does satisfy the condition on images of centralizers .",
    "an important part of showing that the limit set of @xmath22 is a finite union of centralizers , is showing that if an element @xmath1 is conjugate to a relatively short element @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath27 , and if @xmath13 is chosen to be the shortest conjugating word , then the path @xmath28 is actually quasi - geodesic , for quasi - geodesic constants that depend on the relative length of @xmath26 , but not of @xmath1 .",
    "this follows from showing that the mapping class group has relative conjugacy bounds , which means that the relative length of a shortest conjugating word is bounded in terms of the relative lengths of the two conjugate words .",
    "using further work of masur and minsky @xcite , we show that the mapping class group has relative conjugacy bounds by considering the action of the mapping class group on the complex of curves .",
    "the relative conjugacy bound property is equivalent to discreteness for the action of the mapping class group on the complex of curves , in the following sense : hyperbolic isometries have a minimal translation distance , and elliptic isometries have centralizers which act coarsely transitively on their coarse fixed sets .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ section : defs ]",
    "we review some well known definitions and results . in section",
    "[ section : conjugacy ] we show that the mapping class group has relative conjugacy bounds . in section [ section : coarse ]",
    "we describe the distribution of @xmath23-dense reducible elements in the mapping class group , and finally in section [ section : random ] we prove the main result on random walks .",
    "i would like to thank nathan dunfield and howard masur for useful advice .",
    "i would especially like to thank the referees for pointing out many errors in an earlier version , supplying a correct proof of lemma [ lemma : ref ] , and for suggestions on how to re - organize the paper .",
    "i would also like to thank danny calegari , daniel groves and jason manning for helpful conversations .",
    "part of this paper was written while i was at the california institute of technology , and part while i was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the centre de recherches mathmatiques and the institut des sciences mathmatiques in montral .",
    "this work was also partially supported by nsf grant dms-070674 .",
    "in this section we review some of the definitions and results we will use in the main part of the paper , and fix some notation .",
    "let @xmath0 be the closed orientable surface of genus @xmath1 with @xmath6 marked points , also known as punctures",
    ". we will write @xmath29 if we need to explicit refer to the genus @xmath1 , and the number of punctures @xmath6 .",
    "the mapping class group of @xmath0 is the group of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of the surface which preserve the set of punctures , modulo those isotopic to the identity .",
    "we say a surface is _ sporadic _ if it is a sphere with at most four punctures , or a torus with at most one puncture .",
    "if @xmath0 is a sphere with three or fewer punctures , then the mapping class group of @xmath0 is finite , and does not contain any elements . if @xmath0 is a torus with at most one puncture , or a four punctured sphere , then the mapping class group is commensurable with @xmath30 , and random walks on @xmath30 are well understood by work of furstenberg @xcite .",
    "so for the remainder of this paper we will assume that the surface @xmath0 is _ not _ sporadic .",
    "however , we will at times need to consider subsurfaces of @xmath0 which may be sporadic , so certain results will be needed for surfaces which include a torus with one puncture , or a four punctured sphere .",
    "dehn @xcite and lickorish @xcite showed that the mapping class group is finitely generated .",
    "in fact , we can describe an explicit generating set using dehn twists .",
    "a dehn twist is a map from the surface to itself defined by cutting the surface along an essential simple closed curve , and then gluing the two boundary components back together using a full twist .",
    "we say a simple closed curve in the surface is _ essential _ if it does not bound a subsurface which is either a disc , or a disc containing a single puncture .",
    "a dehn twist represents a non - trivial element of the mapping class group .",
    "a dehn twist is supported in a neighbourhood of the simple closed curve used to define it , and takes a transverse arc in a regular neighbourhood of the simple closed curve to one which winds once around the annular regular neighbourhood .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ picture31 ] below .",
    "the collection of dehn twists in the simple closed curves shown below in figure [ picture21 ] generate the mapping class group of a closed surface with no punctures .",
    "if the surface has punctures , then there is a finite collection of dehn twists which generate the finite index subgroup of the mapping class group which fixes each puncture , and this may be extended to a finite generating set for the whole group by adding elements which permute the punctures .",
    "these elements may be chosen to be half dehn twist in simple closed curves that bound discs containing exactly two punctures , see for example birman @xcite*chapter 4 .",
    "we shall think of elements of the mapping class group as functions on surfaces , so we will write @xmath31 to denote @xmath32 for all @xmath33 .    the collection of essential simple closed curves in the surface may be made in to a simplicial complex , called the the _ complex of curves _ , which we shall denote @xmath34 .",
    "the vertices of this complex are isotopy classes of simple closed curves in @xmath0 , and a collection of vertices spans a simplex if representatives of the curves can be realised disjointly in the surface .",
    "the complex of curves is a finite dimensional simplicial complex , but it is not locally finite .",
    "we will write @xmath35 to denote the vertices of the simplicial complex @xmath34 , which is the set of isotopy classes of simple closed curves . we will write @xmath36 for the distance in the one - skeleton between two vertices @xmath5 and @xmath7 of the complex of curves",
    ". we will always consider the complex of curves to have a basepoint @xmath37 , which we shall take to be one of the curves corresponding to a standard generating set for the mapping class group .",
    "the mapping class group acts by simplicial isometries on the complex of curves . for certain sporadic surfaces the definition above produces a collection of disconnected points , and",
    "so a slightly different definition is used .",
    "if the surface is a torus with at most one puncture , then two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding simple closed curves may be isotoped to intersect transversely exactly once .",
    "if the surfaces is a four punctured sphere , then two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding simple closed curves may be isotoped to intersect transversely in two points . in these cases ,",
    "the resulting curve complex is isomorphic to the farey graph .",
    "a geodesic metric space is _",
    "@xmath16-hyperbolic _ if every geodesic triangle is @xmath16-slim , i.e. each edge is contained in a @xmath16-neighbourhood of the other two .",

    "an explicit bound for @xmath16 in terms of the complexity of the surface is given by bowditch @xcite .",
    "according to thurston s classification of surface automorphisms , there are three sorts of elements of the mapping class group .",
    "we say that an element @xmath1 of the mapping class group is _ periodic _ if it has finite order .",
    "we say @xmath1 is _ reducible _ , if it fixes a disjoint collection of simple closed curves in @xmath0 .",
    "the periodic and reducible elements act on the complex of curves as elliptic isometries .",
    "all other elements are _ pseudo - anosov _ , and act on the complex of curves as hyperbolic isometries .",
    "let @xmath4 be a finitely generated group , together with a symmetric generating set @xmath38 .",
    "for each element @xmath1 of @xmath4 , we define the word length of @xmath1 to be the length of the shortest word representing @xmath1 in the generating set @xmath38 .",
    "this length function on @xmath4 induces a left - invariant distance metric on @xmath4 , called the _",
    "word metric_. this metric may also be obtained by forming the _ cayley graph _",
    "@xmath39 for the group .",
    "the cayley graph is the graph whose vertices consist of elements of @xmath4 , with two group elements @xmath40 and @xmath41 connected by an edge if @xmath42 is a member of the generating set .",
    "if we set the length of each edge equal to @xmath43 then the distance between two vertices in the cayley graph is the same as the word metric distance",
    ". different choices of generating set give different , but quasi - isometric , word metrics .",
    "we will assume we have fixed some generating set for the mapping class group , and we will write @xmath44 for the word length of @xmath5 , and @xmath45 for the distance from @xmath5 to @xmath7 in the word metric on @xmath4 .",
    "a geodesic in the word metric on @xmath4 is a word of minimal length in the generating set .",
    "given a group @xmath4 , and a collection of subgroups @xmath46 , we define the _ relative length _ of a group element @xmath1 to be the length of the shortest word in the typically infinite generating set @xmath47 .",

    "we will write @xmath49 to denote the group @xmath4 with the relative metric , which we shall also refer to as the _ relative space_. this space is quasi - isometric to the _ relative _ or _ electrified cayley graph_. the relative cayley graph @xmath50 is the graph formed by adding a vertex for each coset @xmath51 , and then connecting this vertex to each element of the coset @xmath51 by an edge of length one - half",
    ". however , we will find it convenient to work with @xmath49 rather than the electrified cayley graph .",
    "we will write @xmath52 for the relative length of @xmath5 , and @xmath53 for the relative distance from @xmath5 to @xmath7 .",
    "a geodesic in the relative space is a word of minimal length in the generators @xmath47 .",

    ", relative to a finite list of subgroups @xmath48 , if the relative space @xmath49 is @xmath16-hyperbolic .",
    "this definition of relative hyperbolicity is due to farb @xcite , and is more general than the definition of strong relative hyperbolicity due to gromov @xcite , see also bowditch @xcite .",
    "osin @xcite contains a detailed discussion of several definitions of relative hyperbolicity , and their relations .",
    "we may consider the relative metric on the mapping class group with respect to the following collection of subgroups .",
    "let @xmath54 be a list of representatives of orbits of simple closed curves in @xmath0 , under the action of the mapping class group .",
    "we may choose the @xmath55 to be distance at most one from the curves corresponding to the standard generators illustrated in figure [ picture21 ] .",

    "then the electrified cayley graph @xmath50 is quasi - isometric to the complex of curves @xmath34 .",

    "we will always measure distances in @xmath34 between points that lie in the zero - skeleton , so the complex of curves is effectively a discrete space .",
    "furthermore , the relative distance between two elements is zero if and only if they are the same , so we only need an additive quasi - isometry constant on the right hand side of the inequalities below .",
    "@xmath59    the _ gromov boundary _ of a @xmath16-hyperbolic space is the set of endpoints of quasi - geodesic rays , where two quasi - geodesic rays are said to be equivalent if they stay a bounded distance apart .",
