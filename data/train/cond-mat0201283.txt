    "the experimental study of the inelastic ( raman ) scattering of light in arrays of quantum dots ( qdots ) began a few years ago @xcite .",
    "these studies were aimed at investigating multipole excitations or spin excited states in the quantum dot , which do not leave traces in luminescence or absorption experiments . in both papers ,",
    "quasi - bidimensional dots with radii around 100 nm and nominal electron density about @xmath1 were studied . a rich spectrum of single - particle ( spe ) , and collective charge - density ( cde ) and spin - density excitations ( sde ) was observed .",
    "the single - particle spectra were interpreted in terms of the single - particle density of states in the dot @xcite , computed in the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation .",
    "the energy position and raman strengths of cde states in dots with 12 electrons , computed within time - dependent hf theory @xcite , were shown to qualitatively agree with the experimental results .",
    "more consistent calculations in the framework of time - dependent density - functional theory ( dft ) were carried out in ref . , where the charge and spin dynamic structure functions were computed for a system of 200 electrons .",
    "the multipolarities of the observed cde and sde peaks , and the relative peak intensities , as functions of the transferred wave vector of the light , were reproduced .",
    "let us stress that , in electron qdots , raman processes in which the final states are sde require the account for valence - band mixing in the intermediate hole state .",
    "for this reason , cde peak intensities reported in ref . can not be properly compared with intensities in the sde channels .",
    "the inclusion of valence - band mixing effects in the intermediate states of raman processes is to be published elsewhere @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we compute raman amplitudes for neutral quantum dots , where the number of holes , @xmath2 , equals the number of electrons in the dot . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there are no similar calculations in the literature .",
    "although the lifetime of the excitons may pose certain difficulties to the raman measurements , we believe that it does not represent a real challenge to present experiments . with relative independence on the dot parameters , the multi - excitonic system reaches typical densities around @xmath3 pairs/@xmath4 , a value which may be obtained by pumping a neutral qdot with a stationary mean - power laser .",
    "in fact , densities well above @xmath5 have been achieved already for a few years @xcite with pulsed high - power lasers .    due to the lack of experimental results",
    ", we will focus on the qualitative aspects following from our calculations .",
    "a simplified two - band model of a disk - shaped qdot with parabolic confinement @xcite is to be used .",
    "we shall , first , make some remarks concerning the computational method .",
    "the random phase approximation ( rpa ) is the common frame , as in the cited papers .",
    "we adopt the wave - function approach of nuclear physics @xcite , and construct rpa approximations to the wave functions of both final and intermediate states .",
    "coulomb interactions and collective effects are exactly accounted for within the rpa , even for the intermediate states entering the raman amplitudes , which are states with @xmath6 e - h pairs .",
    "corrections to the rpa functions , such as the e - h pairing correlations , could , in principle , be included by means of the quasiparticle rpa scheme @xcite .",
    "the electron - radiation ( e - r ) interaction hamiltonian is written in second quantization in the basis of hf single - particle states .",
    "our treatment of raman scattering follows the lines of refs . and , in the sense that the e - r interaction causes transitions between multi - excitonic states .",
    "thus , energy denominators contain @xmath2-pair instead of single - particle energies .",
    "concerning the numerical results , there are a few points to stress .",
    "first , the absorption threshold , or the frequency for which extreme resonance is achieved in raman scattering , grows at a rate of 0.3 mev per pair added to the dot .",
    "this is an indirect way of determining the mean number of pairs in the dot .",
    "second , raman peaks in quadrupole channels are 1/10 of monopole peaks at momentum transfer around @xmath7 .",
    "next , intensities corresponding to weakly collective or spe are comparable in magnitude to the strongest cde peaks , and vary very rapidly with the magnetic field or the frequency of the incident laser .",
    "thus , our calculated spectra resemble more the complex spectra of quantum wells in strong magnetic fields @xcite , and differ from the smooth experimental curves obtained in ref . for the pure electronic strong - confinement qdot .    a last point which deserves attention is the fact that raman scattering in sde channels do not require mixing of hole bands .",
    "thus sde peaks should be observed in any polarization of the scattered light .",
    "the present calculation of raman cross sections completes a series of papers on the optical properties of the @xmath2-pair system in a qdot .",
    "the dominance of a giant dipole resonance in the infrared absorption , which position scales as @xmath8 , was shown in ref . .",
    "this resonance could be studied through the modulations of the photoluminescence caused by an infrared source , in the same way as the infrared excitations in the `` @xmath2-electron plus one hole '' system are presently studied @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the position and intensity of the coherent magneto - luminescence peak were computed in ref . .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "the basic expressions for raman cross sections along with hf , rpa and particle - particle tamm - dancoff approximations ( pp - tda ) are presented in section ii .",
    "the formalism is well established in the nuclear physics context @xcite .",
    "we underline in that section only the main points for the sake of completeness .",
    "computed ground - state properties , the multipole excitations and their strength variations with magnetic field , the band gap renormalization as a function of the number of pairs , and the raman cross sections are given in section iii .",

    "we start by occupying the lowest oscillator shells , construct the matrix inside brackets in ( [ hf ] ) , and iterate until convergence is reached .",
    "the occupation of hf levels is actualized after every 10 steps in accordance to the current values of the hf energies .",
    "15 oscillator shells are used in the calculations , i. e. a total of 240 2d oscillator states .      in the rpa @xcite , we allow a general correlated ground state , @xmath59 , and the excited states are looked for in the form    @xmath60    where the @xmath61 operator for cde states is given by the expression    @xmath62    the index @xmath63 runs over occupied hf states , and @xmath64 runs over unoccupied states .",

    "we give in this sub - section a few qualitative results that follow from the hf calculations .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] a subset of the hf single - particle levels at @xmath136 t. fermi energies are represented as dotted lines .",
    "apart from an overall downward shift , we observe only a slight deformation of free oscillator shells due to coulomb interactions .",
    "the zeeman splitting is not resolved in the figure scale , thus spin - up and -down levels are simultaneously occupied . as a result ,",
    "total electron and hole spins remain equal to zero when the magnetic field is varied between zero and 2 t. in fact , very low spin polarizations persist up to higher magnetic fields , of the order of 20 t. @xcite the total ground - state angular momentum is also zero in this magnetic field range , and persists up to very high @xmath71 , as a prelude to the formation of e - h pairs in zero relative angular momentum states , which maximize coulomb attraction .",
    "let us stress also that fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] qualitatively predicts that single - particle excitations ( spe ) with @xmath137 ( `` quadrupole''-like , represented by arrows in the figure ) are lower in energy than `` monopole '' ( @xmath138 ) or `` dipole '' ( @xmath139 ) excitations at @xmath136 t. this fact is corroborated by the rpa calculations , see below .",
    "the energetic cost of adding an e - h pair with @xmath140 is , according to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , around 15 mev ( plus @xmath10 ) . a value confirmed by the tda results .",
    "electron and hole densities at @xmath141 and 2 t are drawn in fig .",
    "the small differences between both densities are due to the differences between electron and hole in - plane masses .",
    "the maximum value , around @xmath142 pairs/@xmath4 , is typical of excitonic systems .",
    "notice also that density oscillations , related to shell - filling effects , are smoothed as @xmath71 is increased .",
    "this fact is due to the increasing occupations of states in the first landau level , which wave functions have no radial nodes .",
    "cde of various multipolarities in the @xmath2-pair system are obtained from the rpa computations .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the monopole sector , which is the most relevant for raman cde processes .",
    "states with more than 5 % contribution to the energy - weighted sum rule ( [ s1 ] ) are represented in the figure as triangles .",
    "they will be called `` collective '' excitations .",
    "they form three well defined bands accounting for , approximately , 7 , 35 and 5% of the sum rule .",
    "the rest of the monopole strength is divided among 200 states with excitation energy lower than 30 mev .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows also the lowest monopole spe ( triangles plus dotted line ) .",
    "a complex pattern of probability transfer between colliding levels , as the magnetic field is varied , is reflected in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] in the form of abrupt variations of the number of collective levels .",
    "the situation is similar to the behavior of the dipole strength in the biexciton @xcite .",
    "dipole and quadrupole collective levels and the corresponding spe in these sectors are shown in fig .",
    "one sees that dipole excitations are , as a rule , lower than monopole and quadrupole collective cde , but the quadrupole spe are lower at @xmath136 t , as mentioned above with regard to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] a few results following from the pp - tda calculations . in the upper figure , the lowest @xmath121 for the intermediate state with @xmath6 pairs , in which the added pair has @xmath140 , is drawn .",
    "this magnitude can be taken as the renormalization of the absorption edge due to the background of @xmath2 electron - hole pairs .",
    "let us stress that there are two main effects contributing to this magnitude .",
    "the first is the blue shift induced by fermi statistics , i. e. the added pair should occupy higher hf single - particle states .",
    "the second is the red shift caused by coulomb ( attractive ) interactions .",
    "as can be seen in this figure , for @xmath0 the net result is a blue shift of 12 - 16 mev .",
    "the apparent kinks are signals of ground - state rearrangements as the magnetic field is varied .",
    "the lowest part of fig . [ fig6 ] shows the dependence on @xmath2 of the edge renormalization at @xmath136 t. it grows from 3 mev for 12 pairs up to 14 mev for the 42-pair system .",
    "that is , at a rate of 0.3 mev per pair in the dot .",
    "this magnitude can be used as a complementary way of determining the mean number of pairs in the dot .",
    "let us consider raman processes in which the final states are cde .",
    "the first important question we would like to address is the role played by collective and spe in resonant raman amplitudes .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the raman differential cross section , computed from    @xmath143 is the solid angle element in the direction of the dispersed light .",
    "we will use a smearing of the delta function as follows :    @xmath144    with a phenomenological @xmath145 mev .",
    "the spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] are computed under conditions of normal incidence ( @xmath146 , only monopole final states are excited ) and parallel light polarization .",
    "the latter is supposed to disentangle collective cde modes from sde in electronic qdots under non - resonant scattering @xcite .",
    "the monopole strengths are also included in the figure for comparison .",
    "the upper figure shows results at @xmath136 t. there are always raman peaks associated to the more collective cde states , although their magnitude rapidly vary with the incident laser frequency .",
    "the overall behavior , which is apparent in this figure , is that low - energy weakly collective or spe are favored at `` extreme resonance '' , i. e. when @xmath9 is near 1574 mev in this situation , whereas 30 mev above the effective band gap high - energy collective or weakly collective cde give the strongest peaks .",
    "notice that the maximum peak intensities under extreme resonance are reached for laser frequencies a few mev above the renormalized band gap .",
    "thus , as the laser frequency moves above 1574 mev , the amplitudes corresponding to weakly collective or spe initially increase , but further experience a sudden drop .    in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the spectra at @xmath147 t are drawn .",
    "we notice variations in the peak distributions as compared to the @xmath136 t results .",
    "notice also that , in both spectra , the strongest cde state is not seen as a distinct peak for @xmath148 mev .",
    "the qualitative conclusions to be extracted from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] are thus the following : ( a ) comparable raman intensities for strongly collective and for weakly collective states ( even for spe at intermediate excitation energies ) , ( b ) a complex pattern of variations of the raman intensities as the frequency of the incident laser or the magnetic field is varied .",
    "distinct peaks are seen only in certain intervals of these magnitudes , and ( c ) a richer structure of the raman spectra as compared with the charged quantum dots .",
    "the second important point to discuss , from the qualitative point of view , is the excitation of high multipolarity modes at non - zero momentum transfer .",
    "we notice that the light wave vector is around @xmath149 nm@xmath150 in the present situation .",
    "the maximum momentum transfer is thus @xmath151 nm@xmath150 in backscattering geometry .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the quadrupole spectra at @xmath136 t in the parallel light polarization configuration and momentum transfer equal to @xmath149 nm@xmath150 ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "of course , in an experimental curve all the multipolarities come together .",
    "we separate the quadrupole spectra to simplify the analysis .",
    "first , we notice that quadrupole raman intensities are 1/10 of monopole ones . on qualitative grounds ,",
    "one expects quadrupole intensities of order @xmath153 , where @xmath154 nm is the system diameter , and @xmath155 is the number of intermediate states participating in the process .",
    "@xmath156 provides a factor @xmath157 , but the number of states contributing to quadrupole processes is roughly three times the states contributing to monopole processes ( intermediate states with excess angular momentum 0 , + 1 , and + 2 in the @xmath158 case , for example ) . thus @xmath159 .",
    "second , we observe an asymmetry between the @xmath160 and @xmath161 spectra .",
    "most of the @xmath160 peaks correspond to spe or weakly collective states .",
    "the @xmath161 peaks , two or three times more intense , are concentrated around collective states , which strengths are more uniformly distributed .",
    "the most collective cde state with @xmath161 shows up as a distinct peak only in a thin range of frequencies .",
    "other multipoles show similar behavior .",
    "thus , the conclusions coming from fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] are the following : ( a ) the intensity of cde raman peaks with multipolarity @xmath162 are proportional to @xmath163 , and ( b ) negative-@xmath162 peaks correspond mainly to very weakly collective or spe states .",
    "the peak associated to the most collective cde state is well defined practically at any @xmath9 . on the other hand ,",
    "positive-@xmath162 peaks are stronger and show a dominance of collective states .    a third interesting question to be addressed",
    "is related to the modes excited when the dispersed light polarization is orthogonal to the polarization of the incident light .",
    "the results for monopole states at @xmath136 t are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] . under extreme resonance ,",
    "we observe peaks associated to spe modes with excitation energies lower than 12 mev .",
    "in particular , the lowest spe at 4 mev is clearly distinguished .",
    "raman signals due to cde states are strongly suppressed in these conditions .",
    "30 mev above extreme resonance , the dominant peaks are located at higher excitation energies .",
    "they correspond to spe or weakly collective states .",
    "we have computed the raman amplitudes for the light scattered of a qdot which contains 42 e - h pairs . in an attempt to identify the states giving rise to the strongest peaks , we compared the raman intensities with the multipole strengths .",
    "the result is that both collective and spe states play important roles in raman spectra . their relative weight in the spectra",
    "is seen to strongly depend on the external magnetic field , the polarization of the scattered light and the frequency of the incident light . taken in a wider context , this conclusion suggests caution when making an assignment to an experimental raman peak , and urges for theoretical calculations in parallel to the experiments .",
    "the explicit construction of the wave functions for the intermediate states , always in the framework of mean - field time - dependent approximations , allows us to consider extreme as well as non extreme resonance conditions . in the same way",
    ", the formalism allows for any wave momentum transfer or any kind of light polarization",
    ".    we can not presently consider sde final states .",
    "the reason has been explained briefly in the text : the sdes are `` 2p-2h '' states , which can not be modeled by the rpa approximation adopted in this work .",
    "it shall be said , however , that none of the papers or accounted for valence - band mixing effects in the intermediate hole state in raman sde channels .",
    "however , on qualitative grounds , it can be argued that sde final states shall give strong raman peaks , may be even stronger than cde states .",
    "the argument goes as follows .",
    "it may be seen that the factor determining the raman amplitude is in fact the orbital factor , i. e. the overlapping between the electron and hole wave functions . in the symmetric , @xmath164 ,",
    "system we are studying , the overlapping is high in the intermediate states ( both e and h above the fermi levels ) , but low for cde final states because one of the annihilated particles is above its fermi level , and the other is below . for sde states , however ,",
    "both the annihilated e and h are below their fermi levels , and the overlapping may be high .",
    "thus , raman sde amplitudes could be even stronger than cde amplitudes .    in the electronic qdots ,",
    "raman scattering in sde channels goes through hole band mixing .",
    "apart from the low overlapping in final states , one would expect the amplitude to be proportional to the light hole component of the hole wave function .",
    "due to the fact that the coulomb interaction is diagonal in the band indexes , a strong electronic background could depress valence band mixing , thus making sde amplitudes even weaker .",
    "research along this direction is in progress .",
    "part of this work was carried out at the abdus salam ictp .",
    "a. d. and a. g. acknowledge the ictp associate and federation schemes office for support .",
    "we give in this appendix the expressions for the band and orbital factors entering eqs .",
    "( [ her- ] ) and ( [ her+ ] ) . the ratio of the band factor @xmath165 to the magnitude @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the interband gaas constant , is given in tab . [ tab1 ] .",
    "@xmath168 is the spin projection over the @xmath106 axis .",
    "conventionally , we assign @xmath169 to the @xmath170 electron state in the valence band .",
    "the @xmath171 components are defined as    @xmath172    the band factor entering eq .",
