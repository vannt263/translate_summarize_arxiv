    "the standard model of cosmology , @xmath0cdm , is today confronted with several inconsistencies and unpalatable coincidences , even though it arguably represents the most successful attempt at accounting for the cosmological observations .",
    "many have written extensively on this subject , including , e.g. , spergel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and tegmark et al .",
    "for example , @xmath0cdm has been used with measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation to infer that the universe is flat , so its energy density @xmath8 is at ( or very near ) its  critical \" value @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the hubble constant and the other symbols have their usual meanings . yet among the many peculiarities of the standard model is the inference that the density @xmath11 of dark energy must itself be of order @xmath12 .",
    "worse , no reasonable explanation has yet been offered as to why such a fixed , universal density ought to exist at this scale .",
    "it is well known that if @xmath0 is associated with the energy of the vacuum in quantum theory , it should have a scale representative of phase transitions in the early universe120 orders of magnitude greater than @xmath12 .",
    "the most recent  and perhaps most disturbing  coincidence with @xmath0cdm is the apparent equality of our gravitational horizon @xmath1 with the distance @xmath2 light has traveled since the big bang ( in terms of the presumed current age @xmath3 of the universe ) .",
    "this equality was first identified as a peculiarity of the standard model in melia ( 2003 ) , and has come under greater scrutiny in recent years ( melia 2007 , 2009 ; melia & abdelqader 2009 ; van oirschot et al .",
    "2010 ; see also lima 2007 for a related , though unpublished , work ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to advance a possible explanation for why the observed equality @xmath13 may in fact not be a coincidence of any particular model , such as @xmath0cdm .",
    "rather , we suggest a reason why it may be required for all cosmologies , by an application of birkhoff s theorem and its corollary , together with the weyl postulate , to the properties of the friedmann - robertson - walker spacetime .",
    "more importantly , we show that , at least for flat cosmologies , this equality may actually be upheld for all cosmic time @xmath6 which , however , would not be entirely consistent with @xmath0cdm , or any other cosmological model we know of",
    ". we shall see that if our proposal turns out to be correct , models such as @xmath0cdm would then be compelled to fit the data subject to the constraint @xmath13 today , but would therefore incorrectly ascribe the universal expansion to variable conditions inconsistent with this time - independent gr - weyl constraint in the past .",
    "we conclude by suggesting that an @xmath7 universe is unmistakably distinguishable from all other models through a comparison with standard candles at redshifts extending beyond the current type ia supernova limit at @xmath14 , therefore providing a reliable test of our proposal when compared to other models .",
    "standard cosmology is based on the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric for a spatially homogeneous and isotropic three - dimensional space , in which the coordinates expand or contract as a function of time : @xmath15\\;.\\ ] ] the coordinates for this metric have been chosen so that @xmath6 represents the time measured by a comoving observer ( and is the same everywhere , so it functions as a  community \" time ) , @xmath16 is the expansion factor , and @xmath17 is an appropriately scaled radial coordinate in the comoving frame .",
    "the geometric factor @xmath18 is @xmath19 for a closed universe , @xmath20 for a flat , open universe , or @xmath21 for an open universe .    applying the frw metric to einstein s field equations of gr ,",
    "one obtains the corresponding frw differential equations of motion .",
    "these are the friedmann equation , @xmath22 and the  acceleration \" equation , @xmath23 an overdot denotes a derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath6 , and @xmath8 and @xmath24 represent the total energy density and total pressure , respectively",
    ". a further application of the frw metric to the energy conservation equation in gr yields the final equation , @xmath25 which , however , is not independent of equations  ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "in comoving coordinates , the proper distance @xmath26 is measured at constant @xmath6 and one can easily see from equation  ( 2 ) that for purely radial paths in a flat cosmology , @xmath27 .",
    "it is sometimes useful to recast equation  ( 2 ) in terms of @xmath26 ( see equation  9 below ) which can reveal , e.g. , the dependence of the metric coefficients on the observer s gravitational horizon , which we now define .",
    "the hubble radius is the point at which the universal expansion rate @xmath28 equals the speed of light @xmath29 .",
    "but though this radius is well known , it is rarely recognized as just a manifestation of the gravitational radius ( see melia 2007 ) , because every observer experiences zero _ net _ acceleration from a surrounding isotropic mass , suggesting that no measure of distance equivalent to the schwarzschild radius is present in cosmology .",
    "but in fact the _ relative _ acceleration between an observer and any other spacetime point in the cosmos is not zero ; it depends on the mass - energy content between him / herself and that point .",
    "this is most easily understood in the context of birkhoff s theorem and its corollary ( birkhoff 1923)a relativistic generalization of newton s theory , that the gravitational field outside a spherically symmetric body is indistinguishable from that of the same mass concentrated at its center .",
    "what is particularly germane to our discussion here is the corollary to this theorem , describing the field _ inside _ an empty spherical cavity at the center of an isotropic distribution .",
    "the metric inside such a cavity is equivalent to the flat - space minkowski metric @xmath30 , a situation not unlike that found in electromagnetism , where the electric field inside a spherical cavity embedded within an otherwise uniform charge distribution is zero .",
    "not surprisingly , the corollary to birkhoff s theorem is itself analogous to another newtonian result  that the gravitational field of a spherical shell vanishes inside the shell .",
    "so even in the classical limit , one can argue that the medium exterior to a spherical cavity may be thought of as a sequence of ever increasing spherical shells , each of which produces a net zero effect within the cavity .    to understand the emergence of a gravitational radius in cosmology ,",
    "imagine placing an observer at the center of this spherical cavity with proper radius @xmath31 , surrounding him / her by a spherically - symmetric mass with a proper surface radius @xmath32 .",
    "the metric in the space between the mass and the edge of the cavity is given by the schwarzschild solution , and the relative acceleration between the observer and @xmath33 is simply due to the mass enclosed within @xmath33 , which we may write in terms of the cosmic energy density @xmath34 as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the proper volume .",
    "is the volume within which the co - moving density of particles remains fixed as the universe expands . ]",
    "the criterion we will use to define the gravitational radius @xmath37 is @xmath38 ( see melia 2007 , melia & abdelqader 2009 ) . as we shall see below",
    ", the frw equations in principle allow many different kinds of solutions with their own particular form of the expansion factor @xmath16 .",
    "when we impose the condition in equation  ( 8) , however , only one of these solutions is permitted .",
    "this unique solution corresponds to the observed equality @xmath13 , which is most easily inferred from the measurement of @xmath39 in the shoes project ( riess et al .",
    "2009 ) , refining the value previously obtained through the hubble space telescope key project on the extragalactic distance scale ( mould et al . 2000 ) . the hubble constant , @xmath40 km s@xmath41 mpc@xmath41 ,",
    "is now known with unprecedented accuracy . in the context of @xmath0cdm ,",
    "the density @xmath8 is at ( or very near ) its  critical \" value @xmath12 , and with this @xmath39 , @xmath42 billion lightyears ( @xmath43 )",
    ".    equation  ( 8) explains why the hubble radius exists in the first place , and is our proposal for a resolution of the @xmath13 coincidence in the standard model .",
    "ironically , though many may be unaware of the existence of this radius , de sitter s own solution to einstein s equations was actually first written in terms of what we now call the proper distance @xmath27 ; a limiting radius equivalent to @xmath37 appeared in his form of the metric ( see de sitter 1917 ) .",
    "it is now well known that de sitter s spacetime describes a universe driven by an exponential scale factor @xmath16 . in the more general case ,",
    "it is not difficult to show , in terms of the proper radii @xmath44 and @xmath37 , that equation  ( 2 ) transforms to @xmath45 ( melia & abdelqader 2009 ) , where the function @xmath46 signals the dependence of the metric on the proximity of the proper radius @xmath44 to the gravitational radius @xmath37 .",
    "we have here assumed a flat universe with @xmath47 , as indicated by the precision measurements of the cmb radiation ( spergel et al .",
    "the reader will also notice that , formally , @xmath37 functions as the _ static _",
    "limit , since the interval @xmath48 becomes unphysical at any _ fixed _ proper distance @xmath44 beyond @xmath37 . however , there is no such exclusion on the viability of this metric beyond @xmath37 when @xmath49 , such as we have for sources receding from us with the hubble expansion ( more on this below ) .",
    "the impact of equation  ( 8) may now be gauged with the use of equation  ( 3 ) , yielding ( with @xmath47 ) @xmath50 ( see melia & abdelqader 2009 ) .",
    "this is in fact also the definition of the better known hubble radius , which is therefore simply another manifestation of the gravitational radius @xmath37 .",
    "thus , given what we know about the analogous gravitational radius of a static spherical mass , it is not surprising that the expansion rate @xmath51 should equal @xmath29 when @xmath52 , just as the speed of matter falling towards a black hole reaches @xmath29 at the event horizon .",
    "this may be seen most easily from the definition of @xmath44 and equation  ( 11 ) , which together give @xmath53 and therefore @xmath54 when @xmath55 .",
    "below we analyze the role of @xmath37 further and see that , even though equation  ( 9 ) is quite general as written , the definition of the gravitational radius in equation  ( 8) actually selects out only one specific frw solution , which we are proposing as the correct cosmic spacetime .",
    "as a prelude to our further consideration of @xmath37 , we reaffirm the fact that the universe appears to be homogeneous and isotropic on large scales , meaning that observations made from our vantage point are representative of the cosmos as viewed from anywhere else .",
    "known as the cosmological principle , the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy is essential to any attempt at using what we see here from earth as a basis for testing cosmological models .    on large scales",
    ", at least , the universe appears to be expanding in an orderly manner , with galaxies moving apart from one another ( except for the odd collision or two due to some peculiar motion on top of the  hubble flow \" ) .",
    "galactic trajectories on a spacetime diagram would therefore show world lines forming a funnel - like structure in which the separation between any two paths is steadily increasing with time @xmath6 .",
    "homogeneity and isotropy are consistent with this type of regularity , and together suggest that the evolution of the universe may be represented as a time - ordered sequence of three - dimensional spacelike hypersurfaces , each of which satisfies the cosmological principle . this intuitive picture of regularity",
    "is often expressed formally as the _ weyl postulate _",
    ", after the mathematician hermann weyl , who did much of the early work on this subject in the 1920 s ( see , e.g , weyl 1923 ) .",
    "the most general line element satisfying the weyl postulate and the cosmological principle is given by equation  ( 2 ) above , in which the spatial coordinates @xmath56 are constant from hypersurface to hypersurface in the expanding flow , while the temporal behavior of the scale factor @xmath16 reflects the dynamics of the expanding cosmos .",
    "this metric was first rigorously derived in the 1930 s by robertson ( 1935 ) and ( independently ) walker ( 1936 ) , using the ideas espoused earlier by weyl .",
    "it is therefore clear that any proper distance in this spacetime is measured on a spacelike hypersurface in the foliated sequence orthogonal to the non - intersecting geodesics .",
    "we have shown in   3 above that the hubble radius is itself the distance @xmath37 . but according to the definition of @xmath37 in terms of @xmath57 in equation  ( 8) , @xmath37 must itself be a proper distance @xmath58 with the property that @xmath59 is a constant comoving coordinate , otherwise @xmath57 would not represent the volume within which the particle density is constant in the comoving frame . comparing equations  ( 11 ) and ( 13 ) , we therefore see that @xmath60 which means that @xmath61 itself must be constant for consistency with the weyl postulate .",
    "this is the most important consequence of our definition of @xmath37 in equation  ( 8) .    from equation  ( 4 )",
    ", we infer that the acceleration @xmath62 is zero either for an empty universe ( in which @xmath63 ) or one characterized by an equation of state @xmath64 ( refer to the appendix for some additional insight into why these two conditions are actually related ) . and",
    "it is trivial to see from equation  ( 11 ) that @xmath65 for all cosmic times @xmath6 , not just the current value @xmath3 .    within the framework of our proposal , one",
    "may then understand why today we  measure \" @xmath1 to be equal to @xmath2 ( within the observational errors ) , because in a flat universe ( @xmath47 ) consistent with the weyl postulate and the cosmological principle , these two quantities must always be equal .",
    "let us now see how this result impacts the standard model of cosmology . we suppose that @xmath66 where , following convention , we designate the matter , radiation , and dark energy densities , respectively , as @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath11 .",
    "we will also assume that these energy densities scale according to @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "( if dark energy is indeed a cosmological constant @xmath0 , then @xmath72 constant . )",
    "thus , defining @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath75 with the ( flatness ) constraint @xmath76 we may rewrite the friedmann equation as @xmath77 we have here normalized the expansion factor so that @xmath78 , which we assume throughout this paper .    introducing the cosmological redshift @xmath79 , where @xmath80 we can re - arrange this equation to read @xmath81 so that @xmath82^{1/2}}\\;.\\ ] ] that is @xmath83^{1/2}}\\;,\\ ] ] where we have also defined the function @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is the redshift of light reaching us at @xmath3 , but emitted at cosmic time @xmath86 . in this expression , we have used the equality @xmath87 , which is valid in a flat ( @xmath47 ) cosmology .",
    "other than this flat condition , equation  ( 25 ) is identical to that obtained in the concordance model , subject to the density in equation  ( 16 ) .",
    "if we now put @xmath88 and @xmath89 , then clearly @xmath90^{1/2}}\\;.\\ ] ] our proposed form of the gravitational ( i.e. , hubble ) radius in equation  ( 8) leads to the equality @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , any cosmological model consistent with the weyl postulate and the cosmological principle must satisfy the condition @xmath91^{1/2}}=1\\;.\\ ] ] although not immediately obvious , this constraint implies that no matter what period of deceleration or acceleration the universe may have experienced in its past , its overall acceleration averaged over the time @xmath3 must be zero ( melia 2009 ) .",
    "we can best see this directly from the frw equations , which indicate that @xmath92 where the parameter @xmath93 characterizes the total pressure @xmath24 in terms of the total energy density @xmath8 . under the assumption that @xmath37 was much smaller in the distant past than it is today",
    ", we can easily integrate this equation to get @xmath94 where @xmath95 thus , in order for @xmath1 to equal @xmath2 ( which in turn leads to equation  27 ) , we must have @xmath96 , corresponding to an average acceleration @xmath97 in equation  ( 4 ) .    any cosmological model that purports to correctly trace the universal expansion must simultaneously satisfy equation  ( 27 ) and the condition @xmath96 . in @xmath0cdm , for example , dark energy is considered to be a cosmological constant , so @xmath98 . in figure  1 , we plot the value of the integral in equation  ( 27 ) as a function of @xmath99 for a flat @xmath0cdm cosmology . not surprisingly , the integral is @xmath100 when @xmath101 , consistent with the optimized parameters of the concordance model ( see , e.g. , spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) .    using the same optimized parameters to evaluate the integral in equation  ( 31 ) ,",
    "we obtain the time - averaged value of @xmath102 plotted as a function of cosmic time in figure  2 .",
    "we see that @xmath103 at @xmath104 , consistent with the fit shown in figure  1 .",
    "clearly , the simplest way to satisfy both equation  ( 27 ) and the constraint @xmath96 would be to have @xmath64 for all cosmic time @xmath6 .",
    "but this is not what happens in @xmath0cdm , as one can trivially see from figure  2 .",
    "instead , one must adjust the values of @xmath99 and @xmath105 in order to make the integral in equation  ( 27 ) come out to @xmath100 , which ensures that @xmath96 today , but neither @xmath102 nor @xmath106 are equal to @xmath107 at any other time .",
    "this is far from satisfactory , however , because ( as noted previously by melia 2009 ) , the time - averaged value of @xmath102 could then be equal to @xmath107 only once in the entire history of the universe , and that would have to happen right now .",
    "the distinction between our proposed cosmology with @xmath7 ( for all @xmath6 , not just @xmath3 ) , and other frw models with past epochs of deceleration , is quite pronounced at redshifts larger than the current limits ( @xmath108 ) of study .",
    "this happens because the application of birkhoff s theorem , together with the weyl postulate and the cosmological principle , suggests that @xmath64 for all @xmath6 , whereas @xmath106 in @xmath0cdm changes with cosmic time ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "based on current type ia supernova measurements , the use of @xmath0cdm as the standard evolutionary model seems to provide an adequate fit to the data . this could present a problem for our proposal because our explanation for the observed equality @xmath13 would suggest that the @xmath0cdm version of the luminosity distance @xmath109 used to fit the type ia supernova data ( e.g. , the  gold sample \" in riess et al .",
    "2004 ) is not correct in a flat spacetime ( see also riess et al . 1998 , and perlmutter et al . 1999 ) .",
    "however , the disparity between this version of @xmath109 and that required by a flat cosmology with @xmath64 , increases with redshift , so in principle we should be able to distinguish between the two by observing events at sufficiently early times .    in @xmath0cdm , the luminosity distance is given as @xmath110^{1/2}}\\ ] ] where , strictly speaking , dark energy is a cosmological constant , so that @xmath111 , and @xmath112 is zero , since @xmath113 . using this distance measure , riess et al .",
    "( 2004 ) find that the  gold sample \" of 157 sne ia is consistent with an @xmath114 , @xmath115 cosmology , yielding @xmath116 .",
    "adding several free parameters , specifically an acceleration parameter @xmath117 and @xmath118 evaluated at @xmath119 , riess et al .",
    "( 2004 ) find an even better fit with @xmath120 and @xmath121 , yielding @xmath122 .    at face value , this is a reasonable fit .",
    "the caveat , of course , is that one must use many free parameters with this model .",
    "one should also question the validity of introducing two new parameters ( @xmath123 and @xmath118 ) independent of @xmath99 and @xmath124 , given that the expansion history of the universe in @xmath0cdm is completely specified once the latter two are selected . as it turns out",
    ", the additional free parameters improve the fit because the current acceleration needs to be counterbalanced by an earlier deceleration that together yield an overall expansion consistent with a coasting universe ( i.e. , @xmath125 , equivalent to @xmath96 ) .",
    "in contrast , the luminosity distance in a universe with @xmath7 is given by the expression @xmath126 ( see also melia 2009 ) . here , the only parameter is the hubble constant @xmath39 , which enters through our gravitational radius @xmath1 .",
    "this is the proper form of the luminosity distance to use in the analysis of type ia supernova data if our understanding of the relativistic constraint @xmath127 is correct .",
    "however , this form of the luminosity distance , without the luxury of extra free parameters , does not fit the current sample of type ia supernova as well as equation  ( 32 ) .",
    "interestingly , equation  ( 33 ) _ does _ fit the data adequately at low and high redshifts , but not in between , as may be seen , e.g. , in figure  6 of riess et al .",
    "this could be an important clue , because the difficulty with interpreting the data at intermediate redshifts is made more evident through a comparison of the gold sample with other , newer compilations .",
    "though all of the currently available sne ia catalogs yield a consistent and robust value of @xmath99 ( i.e. , @xmath128 ) , they vary significantly when it comes to the inferred redshift @xmath129 at which deceleration is meant to have switched over to acceleration in the present epoc . for example , the gold sample gives a value @xmath130 ( riess et al .",
    "the so - called union2 sample contains 557 events in the redshift range @xmath131 ( amanullah et al .",
    "the analysis of these data alone yield @xmath132 , though with a fairly large uncertainty ( @xmath133 ) , and a combination of the union2 sample with the cmb measurements yield @xmath134 .",
    "the essence sne ia data span the redshift range @xmath135 ( wu et al . 2008 ) .",
    "their analysis yields a transition redshift @xmath136 , roughly in the range of the others , but not as tightly consistent with them as the value of @xmath99 , which essence finds to be @xmath137 , quite close to the value calculated from both the gold and union2 samples .",
    "we draw several conclusions from this comparison .",
    "it is possible , though we believe unlikely , that @xmath0cdm is correct after all and that equation  ( 27 ) is simply a coincidence , as improbable as that may be .",
    "it would then be incumbent upon us to understand where our argument for the constraint @xmath7 has gone wrong .",
    "we stress , however , that we have examined the need for this equality only for a flat cosmology ( i.e. , @xmath47 ) . the disparity between this condition and the type ia supernova data",
    "may be telling us that the universe is not flat after all  if it turns out that the constraint @xmath7 does not apply when @xmath138 .",
    "we will examine this situation next and report the results elsewhere .",
    "on the other hand , it could very well be that @xmath0cdm is currently providing a reasonable fit to the type ia supernova data only because ( i ) it has several free parameters , some of them ( @xmath123 and @xmath118 ) possibly inconsistent with the others ( e.g. , @xmath99 and @xmath105 ) ; and ( ii ) other factors , perhaps astrophysical in origin , are biasing the observed supernova luminosities at intermediate redshifts .",
    "certainly , the fact that @xmath129 varies widely from sample to sample could be an indication that this might be happening .    of course",
    ", there are many other consequences of the @xmath7 constraint , e.g. , with regard to baryogenesis , nucleosynthesis , and structure formation , all of which would have been affected in terms of when they could have occurred , if not the physical conditions prevalent at those times .",
    "although it is beyond the scope of the present work to fully explore all of these processes , a detailed account is necessary before the viability of our proposal can be fully assessed .",
    "this extended analysis is necessary because the current situation with the standard model is far from adequate .",
    "for example , @xmath0cdm does not provide a compelling explanation for the galaxy correlation function . over the past four decades",
    ", the successively larger galaxy redshift surveys have mapped the distribution of galaxies with ever increasing precision , confirming correlation functions consistent with a single power law on all scales ( e.g. , marzke et al .",
    "1995 ; zehavi et al .",
    "2002 ) , from large regions ( @xmath139 mpc ) exhibiting slight density fluctuations , to collapsed , virialized galaxy groups and clusters ( @xmath140 mpc ) .",
    "the lack of any observational feature signaling the transition from one physical domain to the next is surprising when viewed within context of the standard model ( see , e.g. , li & white 2009 ) , because the matter correlation function in the concordance model differs significantly from a power law .",
    "the most recent attempts at accounting for the unexpected galaxy correlation function have relied on several new , fine - tuning additions in order to get the correct profile ( see , e.g. , watson et al .",
    "but the various contributing effects are intertwined and no simple , universal rule exists for which a power - law correlation function emerges.the evolving competition between accretion and destruction rates of subhalos over time is _ required _ to have struck just the right balance at @xmath141 , leading watson et al .",
    "( 2011 ) to conclude that the power - law galaxy correlation function is a cosmic coincidence .",
    "part of the difficulty with this type of analysis is that , besides gravity and pressure , other physical processes can play an important role in the formation of structure , and these are not easy to handle . for example , in baryonic models , the most important physical phenomenon is the interaction between baryons and photons during the pre - recombination era , and the consequent dissipation due to viscosity and heat conduction .",
    "insofar as the @xmath7 universe is concerned , we can leave these elements aside for the moment , and at least suggest how the fundamental equation describing the dynamical growth of density fluctuations would appear in this cosmology . defining the density contrast @xmath142 in terms of the density fluctuation @xmath143 and unperturbed density @xmath8 , we can form the wavelike decomposition @xmath144 where the fourier component @xmath145 depends only on cosmic time @xmath6 , and @xmath146 and * r * are the co - moving wavevector and radius , respectively . in the linear regime ,",
    "the @xmath147-th perturbative mode satisfies the equation @xmath148 where a dot signifies differentiation with respect to @xmath6 , @xmath149 is the cosmic expansion factor we defined earlier , and @xmath150 is the adiabatic sound speed squared , in terms of the pressure @xmath24 and energy density @xmath8 ( see , e.g. , tsagas 2002 ) .",
    "the second term on the left is due to the cosmic expansion and always suppresses the growth of @xmath145 . the combined term on the right reflects the conflict between gravity ( @xmath151 ) and pressure support ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "defining the proper wavelength of the perturbation @xmath153 , one sees immediately that whether gravity or pressure support dominates depends on whether @xmath154 is greater or smaller than the so - called jeans length @xmath155 in the standard model , one solves equation  ( 35 ) by first choosing the constituents of the universe ( e.g. , baryonic matter , cold dark matter , and radiation ) contributing to @xmath8 , adopting an equation of state to calculate @xmath24 and therefore @xmath156 , and then integrating @xmath145 over time from an assumed set of initial conditions .    the origin of the initial seed perturbations is uncertain , one possible explanation being that they are quantum fluctuations boosted to macroscopic scales by inflation .",
    "the primordial power spectrum is usually assumed to have a power - law dependence on scale , @xmath157 with a scale - invariant spectral index @xmath158 , and an unknown normalization factor @xmath159 that must be determined observationally . the initial conditions for the solution to equation  ( 35 ) follow from this because at any redshift @xmath79 , the power spectrum may also be written @xmath160 so the starting size of the fluctuation is @xmath161    equation  ( 35 ) is adequate for most applications , but not in situations where the pressure is a significant fraction of @xmath8 .",
    "in general relativity , both @xmath8 and @xmath24 contribute to the  active \" mass inducing curvature , as evidenced by the appearance of both @xmath8 and @xmath24 in equations  ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "thus , to analyze the growth of perturbations in an @xmath7 universe , we must resort to the relativistic version of equation  ( 35 ) .",
    "fortunately , this transition is greatly simplified by the very simple equation of state implied by the condition @xmath7 , given by @xmath162 with @xmath64 , as we discussed earlier .    for a universe with density @xmath8 and pressure @xmath163 ,",
    "the linear relativistic version of equation  ( 35 ) is @xmath164 therefore , for an @xmath7 universe , the dynamical equation for @xmath145 is @xmath165 we need to emphasize several important features of this equation .",
    "first of all , the active mass in this universe is proportional to @xmath166 , and therefore the gravitational term normally appearing in the standard model is absent ( see equation  35 ) .",
    "but this does not mean that @xmath145 can not grow . instead , because @xmath167 , the ( usually dissipative ) pressure term in equation  ( 35 ) here becomes an agent of growth .",
    "moreover , there is no jeans length scale . in its place is the gravitational radius , which we can see most easily by writing equation  ( 42 ) in the form @xmath168 where @xmath169 note , in particular , that both the gravitational radius @xmath37 and the fluctuation scale @xmath154 vary with @xmath6 in exactly the same way , so @xmath170 is therefore a constant in time .",
    "but the growth rate of @xmath145 depends critically on whether @xmath154 is less than or greater than @xmath37 .    a simple solution to equation  ( 43 ) is the power law @xmath171 where evidently @xmath172 so that @xmath173 thus , for small fluctuations ( @xmath174 ) , @xmath175 whereas for large fluctuations ( @xmath176 ) , @xmath177 where the @xmath178 constants depend on the initial conditions",
    ".    beyond this point there are too many unknowns to pin down the final galaxy correlation function resulting from these growth functions .",
    "for example , we do nt know how to set the values of @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 in a model - independent way , nor does any of this analysis take into account the non - linear growth that follows .",
    "but already we can point to a decided advantage of the @xmath7 universe over @xmath0cdm .",
    "whereas the concordance model predicts different distributions at different scales , in part because of the influence of the jeans length , no such transition region exists for the @xmath7 universe .",
    "instead , the fluctuation growth is driven by the pressure term , which looks the same no matter the perturbation length @xmath174 .",
    "at least in this regard , the @xmath7 universe appears to be a better match to the observations .",
    "fortunately , a resolution to the @xmath0cdm versus @xmath7 universe dilemma will surely come with the observation of standard candles at redshifts even greater than 1.8 ( roughly the current upper limit to the type ia samples ) .",
    "a cosmology with the time - independent constraint @xmath7 predicts a luminosity distance unmistakably distinguishable from that of all other models . and",
    "the differences will manifest themselves most prominently early in the universe s expansion ( i.e. , at large redshift @xmath79 ) , where all other models ( including @xmath0cdm ) predict a rapid deceleration .",
    "this research was partially supported by onr grant n00014 - 09-c-0032 and an nsf graduate student fellowship at the university of arizona , and by a miegunyah fellowship at the university of melbourne .",
    "fm is also grateful to amherst college for its support through a john woodruff simpson lectureship .",
    "the fact that @xmath7 in _ both _ an empty universe ( milne 1940 ) and a flat ( @xmath47 ) universe is not a coincidence , as one may appreciate from a simple heuristic argument justified by the corollary to birkhoff s theorem . as noted by weinberg ( 1972 ) , the fact that the gravitational influence of any isotropic , external mass - energy is zero within a spherical cavity , permits the limited use of newtonian mechanics to some cosmological problems , which we can use here to gain some insight into the dynamics implied by @xmath47 .    consider a sphere  cut out \" of a homogeneous and isotropic universal medium with ( proper ) radius @xmath183 . adopting the cosmological principle",
    ", we assume that the density within this region is a function of time @xmath6 only , and that every point within and without the sphere expands away from every other point in proportion to the time - dependent scale factor @xmath16 , which itself is the same everywhere . according to birkhoff s theorem and its corollary",
    ", we only need to consider contributions to the energy from the contents enclosed within @xmath184 to determine the local dynamics of this region extending out to @xmath184 .",
    "relative to an observer at the center of this sphere , the kinetic energy of a shell with thickness @xmath185 at radius @xmath44 is therefore @xmath186 and integrating this out from @xmath187 to @xmath188 , one easily gets the total kinetic energy of this sphere relative to the observer at the origin : @xmath189    let us now calculate the corresponding gravitational potential energy of this spherical distribution ( remember that this is a classical approach ) .",
    "the potential energy of the shell at @xmath44 is @xmath190 where @xmath191 is the total mass enclosed inside radius @xmath44 . and",
    "integrating this out from @xmath187 to @xmath188 , we see that the total potential energy of this sphere ( as measured by the observer at the origin ) is @xmath192    classically , then , the observer measures a total energy of this sphere given by @xmath193 which may be re - arranged to cast it into a more recognizable form : @xmath194 evidently , the local conservation of energy relative to the observer at the origin is actually the friedmann equation ( 3 ) , when we identify the spatial curvature constant as @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the _ total _ local energy density .",
    "a universe with positive curvature therefore corresponds to a net negative energy , which means the system is bound , whereas a negative curvature is associated with a positive total energy density ( @xmath197 ) , characterizing an unbound universe .",
    "a universe with net zero energy is therefore flat ( @xmath47 ) , and the latest cosmological measurements ( see , e.g. , spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) are apparently telling us that this is the state we re in .",
    "let us remember that general relativity is a local theory ; it tells us only about the gradient of the spacetime curvature locally due to the presence of a source at that point .",
    "as far as general relativity is concerned , therefore , the local dynamics of a universe with net zero energy density ( @xmath198 ) is indistinguishable from an empty ( or milne ) universe .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath199 in both cases , and why @xmath7 ."
