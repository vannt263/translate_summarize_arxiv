    "human beings are extraordinarily complex agents .",
    "remarkably , in spite of that complexity a number of striking statistical regularities are known to describe individual and societal human behavior @xcite .",
    "these regularities are of enormous practical importance because of the influence of individual behaviors on social and economic outcomes .",
    "even though the analysis of social and economic data has a long and illustrious history , from smith  @xcite to pareto  @xcite and to zipf  @xcite , the recent availability of digital records has made it much easier for researchers to _ quantitatively _ investigate various aspects of human behavior . in particular , the availability and omnipresence of e - mail communication records is attracting much attention @xcite .",
    "recently , barabsi studied the e - mail records of users at a university and reported two patterns in e - mail communication  @xcite : the time interval between two consecutive e - mails sent by the same user , which we will denote as the interevent time @xmath1 , and the time interval between when a user sends an e - mail and when a recipient sends an e - mail back to the original sender , which we will denote as the waiting time @xmath2 , follow power - law distributions which decay in the tail with exponent @xmath0 .",
    "additionally , barabsi proposed a priority queuing model that reportedly captures the processes by which individuals reply to e - mails , thereby predicting the probability distribution of @xmath2 .    here , we demonstrate that the empirical results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite are an artifact of the data analysis .",
    "we perform a standard bayesian model selection analysis that demonstrates that the interevent times are well - described by a single log - normal while the waiting times are better described by the superposition of two log - normals .",
    "our analysis rejects beyond any doubt the possibility that the data could be described by truncated power - law distributions .",
    "we also critically evaluate the priority queuing model proposed by barabsi to describe the observed waiting time distributions .",
    "we show that neither the assumptions nor the predictions of the model are plausible .",
    "we thus conclude that the description of human e - mail communication patterns remains an open problem .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the preprocessing of the data .",
    "we then analyze the distribution of interevent times ( section [ sect : tau ] ) and the distribution of waiting times ( section [ sect : tauw ] ) .",
    "finally , in section  [ sect : pqm ] we investigate the priority queuing model of ref .",
    "we consider here the database investigated by barabsi  @xcite , which was also the focus of an earlier paper by eckmann et al .  @xcite .",
    "this database consists of e - mail records for 3,188 e - mail accounts at a university covering an 83-day period .",
    "each record comprises a sender identifier , a recipient identifier , the size of the e - mail , and a time stamp with a precision of one second . before describing our analysis of the data , we first note some important features of the data which impact the analysis .",
    "the first important fact is that the data were gathered at an e - mail server , not from the e - mail clients of the individual users .",
    "it is quite possible that some users have e - mail clients , like microsoft outlook , which permit users to send multiple e - mails at once regardless of when the e - mails were composed .",
    "moreover , servers may parse long recipient lists into several shorter lists @xcite . for this reason , e - mails to multiple recipients",
    "were occasionally recorded in the server as _ multiple _ e - mails .",
    "each of these duplicate e - mails was then sent in rapid succession to a different subset of the list of recipients in the actual e - mail .",
    "both the client - side and server - side uncertainties introduce artifacts in the time series of interevent times for each user as it could appear that a user is sending several e - mails over a very short time interval .    to minimize these uncertainties , we preprocessed the data in order to focus on _ actual _ human behavior .",
    "first , we identify sets of e - mails sent by a user that have the _ exact _ same size but whose time stamp differs by at most five seconds . ] .",
    "we then remove all but the first e - mail from the time series of e - mails sent , while adjusting the list of recipients to the first e - mail to include all recipients in the removed e - mails .",
    "an additional important fact to note is that some of the e - mail accounts do not belong to `` typical '' users .",
    "for example , user 1962 only sent 5 e - mails while receiving 2,284 e - mails .",
    "this individual s e - mail use is too infrequent to provide useful information on human dynamics .",
    "meanwhile user 4099 sent 9,431 e - mails while receiving no e - mails .",
    "although it can not be confirmed due to the anonymous nature of the data , this e - mail account was in all likelihood used for bulk e - mails , implying that it can not provide information on _ human _ e - mail usage .    to avoid having our analysis distorted ,",
    "we first restrict our attention to users which sent at least 11 e - mails over the 83-day experiment , yielding a minimum of 10 interevent times .",
    "our reasoning is that users sending fewer e - mails do not use e - mail regularly enough to allow us to truly infer patterns of human dynamics .",
    "this procedure excludes 1,976 of the 3,188 original e - mail accounts .",
    "next we examine the ratio of the number of e - mails received to the number of e - mails sent to determine what constitutes a `` typical '' user .",
    "this ratio is well - described by a log - normal distribution , and we use this fact to consider only those users in our study who are within three standard deviations from the mean .",
    "this added constraint excludes an additional 46 users .",
    "we thus focus here on the 1,152 users who fulfill the above criteria ( fig .",
