    "the recent discovery of high-@xmath0 superconductors in the iron pnictides @xcite has renewed a tremendous interest in the interplay between the magnetism and superconductivity .",
    "the similar issue has been vigorously investigated in the high-@xmath0 cuprates over two decades , where antiferromagnetism has been firmly related to the localized electrons of the mott insulator in undoped cuprate compounds@xcite . by contrast , in the pnictides , the undoped parent material is not a simple mott - hubbard insulator but resembles a multi - band bad metal - i.e. , the iron 3@xmath1-electrons are believed to be quite itinerant with their hybridized multi - orbitals forming multiple fermi pockets at the fermi levelband4,band1,band2,band3,kuroki .",
    "it is natural for many to consider the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) order , observed in the undoped parent compounds by the neutron scattering measurements@xcite , as originated from the same itinerant electrons via fermi surface nesting @xcite .",
    "this picture seems more consistent in explaining the arpes@xcite , transportdiscovery , transport , and optical properties@xcite than a purely localized model , e.g. , the @xmath2@xmath3 modelj1j20,j1j21,j1j22,j1j23 , where a mott - insulator transition has been implied .",
    "the latter is more reasonable in explaining the spin excitations in neutron scattering @xcite and high - temperature magnetic susceptibility@xcite , but obviously fails in understanding the bad metal behaviorbadmetal1,discovery , optical , badmetal2 and the presence of the small fermi pockets@xcite in the parent compounds .",
    "based on the overall experimental evidence , an alternative picture has been recently proposed@xcite , which assumes that some kind of orbital - selective mott transition happens in the iron 3@xmath1 orbitals of the pnictides such that both itinerant and mott - localized electron coexist in the system .",
    "the minimal model@xcite based on this picture tries to reconcile the seemingly contradictory experimental facts and provides a natural understanding of the unified driving force behind the collinear antiferromangetic ( af ) order and high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "recently a microscopic realization of an orbital - selective mott transition in the pnictides has been studied@xcite based on the dynamic mean - field theory , which lends further support to this model .",
    "the key and unique feature for such a coexistent itinerant and localized electron system is that the two subsystems share the _ same _ characteristic momenta at @xmath4 @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "namely , the hole and electron fermi surface pockets around @xmath7 and @xmath8 points in the brillouin zone ( bz ) are approximately connected by @xmath9 in the undoped case ( i.e. , close to the fermi surface nesting ) , and at the same time , the local moments are strongly correlated at the af wavevectors @xmath10 . as a consequence , the local hund s rule coupling between the itinerant electrons and local moments can be significantly enhanced around @xmath10 , which is called the _ _ resonant effect__@xcite_. _ at low temperature , such a resonant effect  can serve as a predominant force in driving the _ magnetic _ or _ pairing instability _ at different dopings . here",
    "the magnetic phase is predicted@xcite to be an induced sdw order of the itinerant electrons locking with the collinear af order of the local moments at the _ same _ @xmath10 .",
    "corresponding to such an af ordering , a small sdw gap will open up in the excitation spectrum of itinerant electrons , although _ not _ necessarily pinned at the fermi level as in an sdw state purely driven by fermi surface nesting . at the mean - field level",
    ", the low - lying af fluctuation of the local moments is also gapped at @xmath11 due to the mutual locking of the magnetic orders in the two subsystems .",
    "therefore , after the spontaneous magnetic symmetry breaking , the strong resonant  scattering between the two degrees of freedom gets substantially reduced , which leads to a very coherent charge transport contributed by the ungapped part of the fermi surfaces in consistency with the optical measurement@xcite .    however , it remains an important issue whether a gapless spin wave , i.e. , a goldstone mode , is still present in the magnetically ordered state of such a multi - component system . to answer this question",
    ", one has to go beyond the mean - field theory to study the collective spin fluctuations , which is also important in order to self - consistently address the issue how the charge dynamics gets reshaped in the af phase . in this paper , we shall address this issue with using a realistic five - band model@xcite to characterize the itinerant electrons near the fermi pockets , and a @xmath2@xmath3 type model to describe the mott - localized electrons .",
    "then we study the hund s rule coupling between the itinerant and localized electrons at the rpa level in the magnetic ordered phase .",
    "we demonstrate that the goldstone theorem indeed holds at the rpa level as a gapless spin wave emerges within the mean - field sdw gap of itinerant electrons .",
    "but it is fragile against the ion - anisotropy .",
    "we further find that the coupling between the goldstone mode and the charge carriers diminishes in the long - wavelength around @xmath10  as expected . on the other hand , distinct from a single component system ,",
    "a gapped out - of - phase  collective spin mode is also present with its high - energy part predominantly contributed by the local moments whose energy scale @xmath12 extends over a much wider regime than the sdw gap .",
    "its low - energy part gets strongly renormalized by coupling to the itinerant electrons around @xmath10it becomes gapped once the mean - field sdw order forms by itinerant electrons , which is not significantly modified at the rpa level .",
    "furthermore , such an out - of - phase  mode is not sensitive to a weak ion - anisotropy effect and is thus more robust than the goldstone mode .",
    "the existence of the two branches of spin excitations in the af state is a unique prediction of the present multi - component model . in particular , it is this out - of - phase  spin mode that remains strongly interacting with itinerant electrons , at an energy higher than its gap , and therefore dominates the high - energy magnetic and transport properties in the magnetically ordered phase .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the model and present the mean - field treatment in the magnetically ordered state . then in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the spin dynamics at the rpa level and demonstrate that the spin collective excitations are split into a gapless goldstone mode which is upper - bounded and a gapped out - of - phase mode which extends over a much wider energy scale . in sec .",
    "iv , we study the scattering between the collective spin modes and the itinerant electrons based on the single - particle self - energy of the itinerant electrons and the optical conductivity , which illustrate that the out - of - phase mode will play a dominant role beyond its energy gap . finally , sec .",
    "v is devoted to the discussion and conclusion .",
    "we consider a multi - component system composed of coexistent multiband itinerant and mott - localized electrons described by @xmath13    here @xmath14 is a tight - binding model of multiband itinerant electrons : @xmath15where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the orbital indices .",

    "we ignore the issues like how the fermi surface shape gets affected by the orbital - selective mott transition as well as how the luttinger volume is correctly accounted for and mainly focus on the low - energy physics in the present work .",
    "the third term @xmath28 in ( [ h ] ) is the hund s rule coupling between the spins of itinerant and the localized electrons :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the spin operator of the itinerant electrons in the m - th orbital and @xmath31 denotes the localized moment at site @xmath32 .",

    "it implies that although in the normal state the itinerant electrons may be strongly scattered by the low - lying local moment fluctuations , the sharp coherence of quasiparticles will emerge in the af state , where the gapless goldstone mode is essentially decoupled from the particle - hole continuum and the out - of - phase  mode is gapped .",
    "finally , let us examine the overall structure of the optical conductivity @xmath185 at the mean - field and rpa levels .",
    "it is related to the current - current correlation function @xmath186 through the relation @xmath187where @xmath188 is the fourier transformation of the current - current correlator @xmath189here @xmath190 denotes the @xmath191 current operator @xmath192 along , say , the @xmath141 axis for the five - band model ( [ hitr ] ) defined by@xmath193 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv & \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}\\in r,\\sigma \\alpha \\beta } v_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma \\alpha \\beta } c_{\\mathbf{k}\\alpha \\sigma } ^{\\dagger } c_{\\mathbf{k}\\beta \\sigma } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        omitting the vertex - correction , we find @xmath194with the feynman diagrams shown in fig . 13 . denoting @xmath195at @xmath196",
    "we obtain @xmath197such that @xmath198    the calculated optical conductivity @xmath199 is shown in fig .",
    "the black - squared curve shows the result for the bare five - band itinerant electrons and the red circles represent the result of the sdw reconstructed bands . note that the multi - peak structure is mainly due to the multi - band effect with the lower ones change significantly in the sdw state .",
    "furthermore , by incorporating the scattering with the collective spin modes at the rpa level , as shown by the blue triangles in fig .",
    "14 , no significant change has been found in the optical conductivity with @xmath191 .",
    "it clearly illustrated that the itinerant electrons remain very coherent in the af ordered phase , where the low - lying goldstone mode does not strongly scatter the quasiparticles as expected .",
    "in the af ordered state ( blue solid triangle ) which shows that the quasiparticles remain quite coherent as compared to the case without incorporating the scattering with the collective spin modes ( red solid circles ) . for comparison ,",
    "@xmath200 for the pure five - band model without the sdw reconstruction is shown ( black square).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "in this work , we have studied the collective spin excitations in the af ordered phase of a multi - component system composed of coexistent itinerant and localized electrons .",
    "the main prediction is that a usual spin mode is split into two branches in such a multi - band system with orbital - selective mott transition .",
    "the lower branch is a gapless goldstone mode which is recovered at the rpa level and is quickly damped above @xmath201 by coupling to the particle - hole continuum of itinerant electrons , similar to the case in which the sdw order is due to the pure fermi - surface nesting effect for itinerant electrons .",
    "however , an upper branch remnant spin wave reemerges above the sdw gap over a much wider energy @xmath12 which is dominantly contributed by the local moment fluctuations . here",
    "the lower and upper branches can be regarded as in - phase and out - of - phase combinations of the spin fluctuations from the itinerant and mott - localized electrons , which are clearly distinguished from the single mode in a conventional af state either due to the pure fermi - surface nesting effect for itinerant electrons or af superexchanges of local moments .",
    "experimentally the high - energy spin - wave excitation has been clearly observed by the neutron scattering experiments over an energy scale @xmath202 and presumably survives in the high - temperature regime above the ordered phase .",
    "however , a small gap ( @xmath203 @xmath204 has been generally found in @xmath3@xmath3 and @xmath205@xmath3 , and interpreted as due to ion - anisotropyneutron1,neutron2 . as shown in this work , a small ion - anisotropy can indeed easily destroy the lower branch goldstone mode , while the upper branch is more robust .",
    "it remains to be seen if the lower branch spin mode can be unambiguously identified for a sample with less ion - anisotropy .",
    "another distinct property of the present system is that the itinerant electrons become very coherent in the af ordered phase , leading to a good metallic behavior after the af transition .",
    "this is in contrast to the presumably strong scattering between the itinerant electrons and local moments in the normal state , where due to the very fact that the momentum displacement of the hole - electron fermi pockets of the itinerant electrons matches with the af wavevector of the local moments , there exists a strongly enhanced interaction , i.e. , the _ _ resonant effect  _ _ around @xmath10 , between the two subsystems .",
    "it provides the strong scattering source responsible for a drastic change in the charge response once the system enters the af long - range ordered state at low - temperature . by forming a joint magnetic ordering ,",
    "the two subsystem effectively get decoupled  as the af fluctuations of the local moments gain a gap @xmath150 as the out - of - phase collective mode . on the other hand ,",
    "the gapless goldstone mode is effectively decoupled from the itinerant electrons in the long - wavelength , thanks to the fermi surface reconstruction by the sdw order .    therefore , the collective fluctuations of the local moments can serve as the main driving force for both the af ordering as well as the superconducting pairing in the system via the resonant effect  on itinerant electrons , as first pointed out in ref . @xcite . the resulting magnetic and charge properties in the af ordered state , in particular the two branch collective spin modes predicted in the present work , can be further tested by experiment in order to establish the relevance of the model with the iron pnictides .",
