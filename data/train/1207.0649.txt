    "a relativistic charge crossing a dielectric interface in a rectilinear and uniform motion can originate a highly directional and broad wavelength band radiation emission propagating backward and forward from the boundary surface within a small angle scaling down with the energy of the charge , the so called transition radiation @xcite .",
    "thanks to the instantaneous , highly directional and charge - energy dependent features , transition radiation is a precious tool in the beam diagnostics of a particle accelerator . in the vacuum chamber of a particle accelerator the relativistic charged beam can be indeed intercepted by a movable thin metallic screen and the resulting light pulse can be imaged by a ccd - camera ( charge - coupled - device ) , for instance , to measure the transverse profile of the charged beam . under the key - word otr beam diagnostics ( optical transition radiation ) , the reader can find an enormous specialized literature dedicated to this topic .",
    "for most part of the practical detection conditions ( from the extreme visible to the thz region ) , the metallic screen can be assimilated to an ideal conductor surface and the transition radiation emission can be easily schematized as the result of the dipolar oscillation of the conduction electrons of the metallic surface induced by the electromagnetic field of the incident relativistic charge .",
    "the dipolar oscillation induced in the double layer of charge by the relativistic charge explains indeed how an electromagnetic radiative mechanism , originated by a charge in a rectilinear and uniform motion , can also propagate in the backward direction .",
    "such a model of the double layer of charge , describing the transition radiation emission as the result of the dipolar oscillation of the conduction electrons induced by the relativistic charge , is also enlightening about the kinematics of this radiative mechanism and about the common relativistic nature that it shares with other electromagnetic radiative mechanisms by relativistic charged beams .",
    "the kinematics of the transition radiative mechanism can be indeed schematized as the head - on collision of two distributions of charge as observed in the reference frame of rest of one of the two colliding charged distributions .",
    "the backward and forward double conical transition radiation emission can be thus interpreted as the photon bremsstrahlung emission that two head - on colliding electron beams can originate .",
    "taking into consideration that the transition radiation mechanism shares with other electromagnetic radiative mechanisms , such as the synchrotron or the bremsstrahlung radiation , the same kinematical and relativistic nature , it is thus reasonable to expect that , even at a very short wavelength , some spectral modifications of the radiation intensity due to transverse density of the beam should also affect the transition radiative mechanism by an electron beam in a similar way as , in other electromagnetic radiative mechanism by charged beams , the beam transverse size contributes to determine the so called brilliance or luminosity properties of the radiation source .    in the case of an electron beam at a normal angle of incidence onto a metallic screen with arbitrary size and shape , it can be demonstrated that a covariant and temporal causal formulation of the transition radiation energy spectrum of an electron beam necessarily implies , even at a very short wavelength , a dependence of the radiation spectral intensity on the distribution function of the particle density in the transverse plane @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the transition radiation emission of an electron beam at a normal angle of incidence onto a metallic screen , the longitudinal and transverse coordinates of the electrons play different roles .",
    "the distribution function of the longitudinal coordinates of the @xmath0 electrons determines indeed the sequence of the particle collisions onto the metallic screen and , consequently , on the basis of the temporal causality principle , also the distribution function of the relative emission phases - from the metallic surface - of the @xmath0 single electron amplitudes composing the radiation field .",
    "the distribution function of the @xmath0 electron transverse coordinates contributes as well in determining the relative phase delay of the @xmath0 single electron field amplitudes at the observation point as a function of the transverse displacement of the @xmath0 electrons with respect to the beam axis where the radiation field is supposed to be observed .",
    "but , in addition , because of the relativistic invariance under a lorentz transformation in the direction of motion of the beam , the @xmath0 electron transverse density manifests itself as a covariant feature of the radiation field whose observability can transform but not disappear under a lorentz transformation . in the present work , the covariant and temporal causal formula of the transition radiation energy spectrum of a @xmath0 electron bunch , already derived in an implicit form in @xcite in the most general case of a radiator surface with an arbitrary size and shape , will be here rendered into an explicit form in the particular case of a round radiator with an arbitrary radius .",
    "the so obtained formula of the transition radiation energy spectrum of a @xmath0 electron bunch at a normal angle of incidence onto a round metallic screen is demonstrated to be temporal causal and covariant @xcite and to reproduce , as a limit , some results already well known in literature , such as : the frank - ginzburg formula of the single particle transition radiation energy spectrum in the ideal case of an infinite radiator or the single electron transition energy spectrum radiated by a round metallic screen with a finite radius . finally ,",
    "because of the covariant dependence of the radiation field on the transverse density of the @xmath0 electrons , it results that the distribution function of the @xmath0 electron transverse coordinates affects both the temporal coherent and incoherent parts of the transition radiation energy spectrum . even at a very short wavelength ,",
    "the effect of the @xmath0 electron transverse density on the spectral distribution of the radiation intensity manifests itself as an increase of the radiated energy with the decrease of the beam transverse size and a spectral narrowing of the angular distribution of the radiation intensity in comparison with the ideal case of an electron beam having a point - like transverse extension . in the following , in the case of a bunch of @xmath0 electrons hitting the metallic screen at a normal angle of incidence",
    ", details on the formula of the transition radiation energy spectrum and numerical results will be presented .",
    "a bunch of @xmath0 electrons in a rectilinear and uniform motion along the @xmath1-axis of the laboratory reference frame is colliding , at a normal angle of incidence , onto a flat ideal conductor surface @xmath2 placed in the plane @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath0 electrons are supposed to fly in vacuum with a common velocity @xmath4 .",
    "all the electrons are supposed to hit the metallic screen at a normal angle of incidence .",
    "effects of the angular divergence of the electron beam on the radiation energy spectrum are not considered in the present work . the radiator surface @xmath2 has a round shape with a finite radius @xmath5 .",
    "the observation point of the radiation emission is on the @xmath1-axis at a distance @xmath6 from the screen much larger than the observed wavelength @xmath7 .",
    "the spatial coordinates of the @xmath0 electrons being @xmath8 $ ] with @xmath9 at a given reference time @xmath10 when the center of mass of the charged distribution is crossing the boundary surface , the spectral component of the radiation field resulting from the collision of the @xmath0 relativistic electrons onto the metallic screen reads , see @xcite , @xmath11 where , under the far - field approximation @xcite , the single electron contribution to the radiation field can be calculated in the most general case of a radiator surface @xmath2 with an arbitrary shape and size ( either infinite @xmath12 or finite @xmath13 ) as follows @xcite : @xmath14 in previous equation , @xmath15 is the wave number , @xmath16 is the transverse component of the wave - vector , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 being the relativistic lorentz factor ) and the vector @xmath19 represents the integration variable on the surface @xmath2 of the screen .    with reference to eqs.([uno],[due ] ) , the transition radiation energy spectrum by a @xmath0 electron beam can be finally calculated as the flux of the poynting vector , see also @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 with @xmath22 , as defined in eq.([due ] ) .",
    "the formal expression of the radiation field and of the radiation energy spectrum of the @xmath0 electron bunch , as represented in eqs.([uno],[due ] ) and eq.([tre ] ) in the most general case of a flat radiator surface @xmath2 with an arbitrary size and shape , meets the constraints of the temporal causality and of the covariance .",
    "the structure of the emission phases from the screen of the @xmath0 single electron field amplitudes composing the radiation field - see eqs.([uno],[due ] ) - is indeed causally related to the temporal sequence of the @xmath0 particle collision onto the metallic screen . furthermore , with reference to @xcite , covariant or covariance consistent are all the formal steps which , from the expression of the electromagnetic field of the @xmath0 electron bunch in the laboratory reference frame , leads to the radiation field - see eqs.([uno],[due ] ) - and to the radiation energy spectrum , see eq([tre ] ) . for further details about the covariant and the temporal causal formulation of the transition radiation emission from a @xmath0 electron bunch - as described in eqs.([uno],[due],[tre ] ) -",
    "the reader is addressed to @xcite .    for the sake of ease , in order to proceed with the formal explicit derivation of the transition radiation energy spectrum in the case of a round radiator with a radius @xmath5 , a polar angle representation is considered for the following vectors @xmath23 where @xmath24 @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath19 with @xmath27 being the vectors of the @xmath0 electron transverse coordinates and the vector of the screen coordinates , respectively . taking into account the following integral representation of the bessel function of the first kind @xcite ( see also eq.(@xmath28 ) in @xcite ) : @xmath29 in the limit of a round metallic surface with a radius @xmath5 much longer than the average transverse size of the beam @xmath30 the integral that",

    "diffractive cut - off .",
    "this problem was already tackled in several works @xcite .",

    "temporal causality and covariance constrain the role that the distributions of the longitudinal and transverse coordinates of an electron bunch plays in determining the physical features of an electromagnetic radiative mechanism , in particular , the transition radiation mechanism . in the case of a @xmath0 electron bunch hitting at a normal angle of incidence a metallic screen",
    ", the distribution of the electron longitudinal coordinates defines the causal correlation occurring between the temporal sequence of the electron collisions onto the metallic screen and the structure of the relative emission phases of the @xmath0 single electron radiation field amplitudes propagating from the metallic screen to the observation point , located on the beam longitudinal axis .",
