    "since the development of _ periodic orbit theory _ by gutzwiller @xcite it has become a fundamental question as to how individual semiclassical eigenenergies and resonances can be obtained from periodic orbit quantization for classically chaotic systems .",
    "a major problem is the exponential proliferation of the number of periodic orbits with increasing period , resulting in a divergence of gutzwiller s trace formula at real energies and below the real axis , where the poles of the green s function are located .",
    "the periodic orbit sum is a dirichlet series @xmath2 where the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the amplitudes and periods ( actions ) of the periodic orbit contributions . in most applications eq .",
    "[ g ] is absolutely convergent only in the region @xmath5 with @xmath6 the entropy barrier of the system , while the poles of @xmath1 , i.e. , the bound states and resonances , are located on and below the real axis , @xmath7 .",
    "thus , to extract individual eigenstates , the semiclassical trace formula ( [ g ] ) has to be analytically continued to the region of the quantum poles .    up to now no general procedure is known for the analytic continuation of a non - convergent dirichlet series of the type of eq .",
    "all existing techniques are restricted to special situations . for bound and ergodic systems",
    "the semiclassical eigenenergies can be extracted with the help of a functional equation and the mean staircase function ( weyl term ) , resulting in a riemann - siegel look - alike formula @xcite .",
    "alternative semiclassical quantization conditions based on a semiclassical representation of the spectral staircase @xcite and derived from a quantum version of a classical poincar map @xcite are also restricted to bound and ergodic systems .    for systems with a symbolic dynamics",
    "the periodic orbit sum ( [ g ] ) can be reformulated as an infinite euler product , which can be expanded in terms of the cycle length of the symbolic code .",
    "if the contributions of longer orbits are shadowed by the contributions of short orbits the cycle expansion technique can remarkably improve the convergence properties of the series and allows to extract the bound states and resonances of bound and open systems , respectively @xcite .",
    "a combination of the cycle expansion technique with a functional equation for bound systems has been studied by tanner et al .",
    "however , the existence of a simple symbolic code is restricted to very few systems , and cycle expansion techniques can not be applied , e.g. , to the general class of systems with mixed regular - chaotic classical dynamics .",
    "in this paper we present a general technique for the analytic continuation and the extraction of poles of a non - convergent series of the type of eq .",
    "the method is based on _ harmonic inversion _ by filter - diagonalization .",
    "the advantage of the method is that it does not depend on special properties of the system such as ergodicity or the existence of a symbolic dynamics for periodic orbits",
    ". it does not even require the knowledge of the mean staircase function , i.e. , the weyl term in dynamical systems .",
    "the only assumption we have to make is that the analytic continuation of the dirichlet series @xmath1 ( eq .  [ g ] ) is a linear combination of poles @xmath8 , which is exactly the functional form of , e.g. , a quantum mechanical response function with real and complex parameters @xmath9 representing the bound states and resonances of the system , respectively . to demonstrate the general applicability and accuracy of our method",
    "we will apply it to two systems with completely different properties , first the zeros of the riemann zeta function @xcite , as a mathematical model for a bound system , and second the three disk scattering system as a physical example .    as pointed out by berry @xcite the density of zeros of riemann s zeta function",
    "can be written , in formal analogy with gutzwiller s semiclassical trace formula , as a non - convergent series , where the `` periodic orbits '' are the prime numbers .",
    "a special property of this system is the existence of a functional equation which allows the calculation of riemann zeros via the riemann - siegel formula @xcite .",
    "an analogous functional equation for quantum systems with an underlying chaotic ( ergodic ) classical dynamics has served as the basis for the development of a semiclassical quantization rule for bound ergodic systems @xcite .",
    "the riemann zeta function has also served as a mathematical model to study the statistical properties of level distributions @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate that harmonic inversion can reveal the riemann zeros with extremely high accuracy and with just prime numbers as input data .",
    "the most important advantage of our method is , however , its wide applicability , i.e. , it can be generalized in a straightforward way to non - ergodic bound or open systems .    our second example , the three disk scattering problem , is an open and non - ergodic system .",
    "its classical dynamics is purely hyperbolic , and the periodic orbits can be classified by a complete binary symbolic code . this system has served as a model for the development of cycle expansion techniques @xcite . when applying the harmonic inversion technique to the three disk scattering system we will highlight the general applicability of our method by not having to make use of its symbolic dynamics in any way .",
    "it is evident that methods invoking special properties of a given system may be more efficient regarding , e.g. , the number of periodic orbits required for the calculation of a certain number of poles of the response function @xmath1 in that particular case .",
    "it is not our purpose to compete with the efficiency of such methods .",
    "rather , the advantage of the harmonic inversion technique lies in its wide applicability , which allows the investigation also of systems not possessing special properties .",
    "this is demonstrated in this paper by solving two completely different problems , viz .",
    "the zeros of the riemann zeta function and the three disk scattering system , with one and the same method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we explain the general idea of the method by way of example of the riemann zeros .",
    "this is followed by the derivation of the harmonic inversion method in section 3 and the presentation of numerical results for the riemann zeros in section 4 .",
    "the method is extended to the general case of periodic orbit quantization in section 5 , and its usefulness and wide applicability is demonstrated for the three disk scattering system , as a physical example , in section 6 .",
    "our goal is to introduce our method for periodic orbit quantization by harmonic inversion using , as an example , the well defined problem of calculating zeros of the riemann zeta function .",
    "there are essentially two advantages of studying the zeta function instead of a `` real '' physical bound system .",
    "first , the riemann analogue of gutzwiller s trace formula is exact , as is the case for systems with constant negative curvature @xcite , whereas the semiclassical trace formula for systems with plane geometry is correct only to first order in @xmath10 .",
    "this allows a direct check on the precision of the method .",
    "second , no extensive periodic orbit search is necessary for the calculation of riemann zeros , as the only input data are just prime numbers .",
    "it is not our intention to introduce yet another method for computing riemann zeros , which , as an objective in its own right , can be accomplished more efficiently by specific procedures .",
    "rather , in our context the riemann zeta function serves primarily as a mathematical model to illustrate the power of our technique when applied to bound systems .      before discussing the harmonic inversion method",
    "we start with recapitulating a few brief remarks on riemann s zeta function necessary for our purposes .",
    "the hypothesis of riemann is that all the non - trivial zeros of the analytic continuation of the function @xmath11 have real part @xmath12 , so that the values @xmath13 , defined by @xmath14 are all real or purely imaginary @xcite .",
    "the riemann staircase function for the zeros along the line @xmath15 , defined as @xmath16 i.e.  the number @xmath17 of zeros with @xmath18 , can be split @xcite into a smooth part , @xmath19 and a fluctuating part , @xmath20 substituting the product formula ( [ zeta_def ] ) ( assuming that it can be used when @xmath21 ) into ( [ n_osc_def ] ) and expanding the logarithms yields @xmath22 therefore the density of zeros along the line @xmath15 can formally be written as @xmath23 with the response function @xmath1 given by the series @xmath24 which converges only for @xmath25 .",
    "obviously eq .",
    "[ g_nc ] is of the same type as the response function ( [ g ] ) , with the entropy barrier @xmath26 , i.e. , eq .",
    "[ g_nc ] does not converge on the real axis , where the riemann zeros are located .",
    "the mathematical analogy between the above equation and gutzwiller s periodic orbit sum @xmath27 with @xmath28 the amplitudes and @xmath29 the classical actions ( including phase information ) of the periodic orbit contributions , was already pointed out by berry @xcite . for the riemann zeta function",
    "the primitive periodic orbits have to be identified with the primes @xmath30 , and the integer @xmath31 formally counts the `` repetitions '' of orbits .",
    "the `` amplitudes '' and `` actions '' are then given by @xmath32 both equation ( [ rho_zeta ] ) for the riemann zeros and  for most classically chaotic physical systems  the periodic orbit sum ( [ rho_po ] ) do not converge . in particular , zeros of the zeta function , or semiclassical eigenstates , can not be obtained directly using these expressions .",
    "the problem is to find the analytic continuation of these equations to the region where the riemann zeros or , for physical systems , the eigenenergies and resonances , are located .",
    "[ g_nc ] is the starting point for our introduction and discussion of the harmonic inversion technique for the example of the riemann zeta function .",
    "the generalization of the method to periodic orbit quantization ( eq .  [ rho_po ] ) in section 5 will be straightforward .",
    "although eq .",
    "[ g_nc ] is the starting point for the harmonic inversion method , for completeness we quote the riemann - siegel formula , which is the most efficient approach to computing riemann zeros . for the riemann zeta function it follows from a functional equation @xcite that the function @xmath33\\right\\ }          \\zeta\\left({1\\over 2}-iw\\right)\\ ] ] is real , and even for real @xmath34 . the asymptotic representation of @xmath35 for large @xmath34 , @xmath36 }   \\frac{\\cos\\{\\pi\\overline n(w)-w\\ln n\\}}{n^{1/2 } } \\nonumber \\\\   & - & ( -1)^{{\\rm int}[\\sqrt{w/2\\pi}]}\\left({2\\pi\\over w}\\right)^{1\\over4 } \\ ;     { \\cos\\left(2\\pi\\left(t^2-t-{1/16}\\right)\\right )     \\over\\cos\\left(2\\pi t\\right ) } + \\dots \\ ; , \\label{riemann_siegel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath37 $ ] is known as the riemann - siegel formula and has been employed ( with several more correction terms ) in effective methods for computing riemann zeros @xcite .",
    "note that the principal sum in ( [ riemann_siegel ] ) has discontinuities at integer positions of @xmath38 , and therefore the riemann zeros obtained from the principal sum are correct only to about 1 to 15 percent of the mean spacing between the zeros .",
    "the higher order corrections to the principal riemann - siegel sum remove , one by one , the discontinuities in successive derivatives of @xmath35 at the truncation points and are thus essential to obtaining accurate numerical results .",
    "an alternative method for improving the asymptotic representation of @xmath35 by smoothing the cut - offs with an error function and adding higher order correction terms is presented in @xcite .",
    "an analogue of the functional equation for bound and ergodic dynamical systems has been used as the starting point to develop a `` rule for quantizing chaos '' via a `` riemann - siegel look - alike formula '' @xcite .",
    "this method is very efficient as it requires the least number of periodic orbits , but unfortunately it is restricted to ergodic systems on principle reasons , and can not be generalized either to systems with regular or mixed classical dynamics or to open systems .",
    "by contrast , the method of harmonic inversion does not have these restrictions .",
    "we will demonstrate that riemann zeros can be obtained directly from the `` ingredients '' of the non - convergent response function ( [ g_nc ] ) , i.e. , the set of values @xmath39 and @xmath40 , thus avoiding the use of the functional equation , the riemann - siegel formula , the mean staircase function ( [ n_bar ] ) , or any other special property of the zeta function . the comparison of results in section 4 will show that the accuracy of our method goes far beyond the riemann - siegel formula ( [ riemann_siegel ] ) without higher order correction terms .",

    "it is hard to directly adjust the non - convergent ( on the real axis ) series @xmath1 to the form of @xmath44 .",

    "speculations that the operator @xmath152 can be regarded as the hamiltonian of a quantum mechanical system have been presented by berry @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath152 is not known as it is only defined implicitly by way of its matrix representation ( [ eq : upjj ] ) , which is a linear functional of the signal ( [ c_sigma ] )",
    ". however , the very fact that the riemann zeros are obtained as eigenvalues of some matrix with analytically known coefficients is already intriguing .",
    "as mentioned in section 2 the basic equation ( [ g_nc ] ) used for the calculation of riemann zeros has the same mathematical form as gutzwiller s semiclassical trace formula . both series , eq .",
    "[ g_nc ] and the periodic orbit sum ( [ rho_po ] ) , suffer from similar convergence problems in that they are absolutely convergent only in the complex half - plane outside the region where the riemann zeros , or quantum eigenvalues , respectively , are located . as a consequence , in a direct summation of periodic orbit contributions",
    "smoothing techniques must be applied resulting in low resolution spectra for the density of states @xcite . to extract individual eigenstates the semiclassical trace formula has to be analytically continued to the region of the quantum poles . here",
    "dynamical zeta functions have turned out to be of particular interest .    for _ bound _ and",
    "_ ergodic _ systems one technique is to apply an approximate functional equation and generalize the riemann - siegel formula ( [ riemann_siegel ] ) to dynamical zeta functions @xcite .",
    "the riemann - siegel look - alike formula has been applied , e.g. , for the semiclassical quantization of the hyperbola billiard @xcite . for bound ergodic systems alternative semiclassical quantization conditions based on a semiclassical representation of the spectral staircase @xmath153 @xcite and derived from a quantum version of a classical poincar map @xcite",
    "have also been discussed .",
    "these quantization techniques can not be applied to _ open _ systems . however , if a symbolic dynamics for the system exists , i.e. , if the periodic orbits can be classified with the help of a complete symbolic code , the dynamical zeta function , given as an infinite euler product over entries from classical periodic orbits can be expanded in terms of the cycle length of the orbits @xcite . the _ cycle expansion _",

    "a combination of the cycle - expansion method with a functional equation has been applied to bound systems in @xcite . however , the existence of a complete symbolic dynamics is more the exception than the rule , and the cycle expansion can not be applied , in particular for systems with mixed regular - chaotic classical dynamics .    in this section",
    "we apply the same technique that we used for the calculation of riemann zeros , to the calculation of semiclassical eigenenergies and resonances of physical systems by harmonic inversion of gutzwiller s periodic orbit sum for the propagator .",
    "the method only requires the knowledge of all orbits up to a sufficiently long but finite period and does not rely on either an approximate semiclassical functional equation , nor does it depend on the existence of a symbolic code for the orbits .",
    "the method will therefore allow the investigation of a large variety of systems with an underlying chaotic , mixed , or even regular classical dynamics .",
    "the derivation of an expression for the recurrence function to be harmonically inverted is analogous to that in section 2.2 .      following gutzwiller @xcite the semiclassical response function for chaotic systems",
    "is given by @xmath154 where @xmath155 is a smooth function and the @xmath29 and @xmath28 are the classical actions and weights ( including phase information given by the maslov index ) of periodic orbit contributions .",
    "( [ g_sc ] ) is also valid for integrable @xcite and near - integrable @xcite systems but with different expressions for the amplitudes @xmath28 .",
    "it should also be possible to include complex `` ghost '' orbits @xcite and uniform semiclassical approximations @xcite close to bifurcations of periodic orbits in the semiclassical response function ( [ g_sc ] ) .",
    "the eigenenergies and resonances are the poles of the response function but , unfortunately , its semiclassical approximation ( [ g_sc ] ) does not converge in the region of the poles , whence the problem is the analytic continuation of @xmath156 to this region .    in the following",
    "we make the ( weak ) assumption that the classical system has a scaling property , i.e. , the shape of periodic orbits does not depend on the scaling parameter , @xmath34 , and the classical action scales as @xmath157 examples of scaling systems are billiards @xcite , hamiltonians with homogeneous potentials @xcite , coulomb systems @xcite , or the hydrogen atom in external magnetic and electric fields @xcite .",

    "[ c_qm ] , the frequencies , @xmath9 , can be interpreted as the semiclassical approximation to the poles of the green s function in ( [ g_qm ] ) .",
    "note that the harmonic inversion method described in section 3 allows studying signals with complex frequencies @xmath9 as well .",
    "for open systems the complex frequencies can be interpreted as semiclassical resonances .",
    "note also that the @xmath9 in general differ from the exact quantum eigenvalues because gutzwiller s trace formula ( [ g_sc ] ) is an approximation , correct only to first order in @xmath10 .",
    "therefore the diagonalization of small matrices in ( [ eq : generalized ] ) does not imply that the results of periodic orbit quantization are more `` quantum '' in any sense than those obtained , e.g. , from a cycle expansion @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues are solutions of non - linear equations and the diagonalization is equivalent to the search of zeros of the dynamical zeta function in the cycle expansion technique .",
    "numerical calculation of the zeros is also a non - linear problem and , in contrast to the matrix diagonalization , might encounter a problem of missing roots .",
    "the procedure described above can be generalized in a straightforward manner to the calculation of semiclassical diagonal matrix elements @xmath168 of a smooth hermitian operator @xmath169 . in this case",
    "we start from the quantum mechanical trace formula @xcite @xmath170 which has the same functional form as ( [ g_qm ] ) , but with @xmath171 instead of @xmath52 . for the quantum response function @xmath172 ( eq .",

    "[ a_po , a ] and [ a_cl ] is analyzed with the method of harmonic inversion the frequencies and amplitudes obtained are the semiclassical approximations to the eigenvalues @xmath9 and matrix elements @xmath171 , respectively .",
    "let us consider a billiard system consisting of three identical hard disks with unit radii , @xmath181 , displaced from each other by the same distance @xmath182 .",

    "we first apply it to the case @xmath187 studied before .",
    "note that the ratio corresponds to the very favorable regime for the cycle expansion ( see below ) . in billiards",
    "the scaled action @xmath46 is given by the length @xmath188 of orbits @xmath189 and the quantized parameter is the absolute value of the wave vector @xmath190 .",

    "the groups with oscillating sign belong to periodic orbits with adjacent cycle lengths . to obtain a smooth function on an equidistant grid , which is required for the harmonic inversion method ,",
    "the @xmath114-functions in ( [ c_sc ] ) have been convoluted with a gaussian function of width @xmath192 .",
    "as explained in section 2 this does not change the underlying spectrum .",
    "the results of the harmonic inversion analysis of this signal are presented in fig .",
    "3b and table 3 . the crosses in fig .",
    "3b represent semiclassical poles , for which the amplitudes @xmath43 are very close to @xmath193 , mostly within one percent . because the amplitudes converge much slower than the frequencies",
    "these resonance positions can be assumed to be very accurate within the semiclassical approximation .",
    "in fact , a perfect agreement to many significant figures is achieved for these poles with the results obtained by cycle expansion @xcite , and this agreement confirms that the results in fig .",
    "3b and table 3 are the true semiclassical resonances , i.e. , deviations from the exact quantum poles are solely due to the semiclassical approximation in gutzwiller s trace formula . for some broad resonances marked by diamonds in fig .",
    "3b and table 3 the @xmath43 deviate strongly from @xmath193 , within 5 to maximal 50 percent .",
    "it is not clear whether these strong deviations are due to numerical effects , such as convergence problems caused by too short a signal , or if they are a direct consequence of the semiclassical approximation .",
    "of course , in the exact expression ( [ c_qm ] ) all multiplicities @xmath43 are 1 , but there is no proof that this is still true within the semiclassical approximation . however , for the lowest @xmath194 eigenvalues ( see , e.g. , the first three resonances in table 3 ) , where the agreement with the exact resonance energies is worst @xcite @xmath52 still holds , indicating that there is no @xmath10-dependence for the multiplicities .",
    "the cycle expansion technique is based on the idea that the contributions of long periodic orbits are shadowed by those of short orbits .",
    "for the three disk scattering system this is ideally fulfilled in the limit of a large ratio @xmath195 .",
    "this is no longer true for short distances between the disks and hence the convergence of the conventional cycle expansion becomes rather slow @xcite . as a second example of periodic orbit quantization by harmonic inversion we therefore study the three disk scattering system with a short distance ratio @xmath196 , and thus in a situation where the assumption of the cycle expansion that contributions of long orbits are shadowed by short orbits is no longer a good approximation .",
    "the results are presented in fig .  4 and table 4 .",
    "for large @xmath188 groups of orbits with the same cycle length of the symbolic code strongly overlap and can not be recognized in fig .",
    ". the signal is obtained from periodic orbits with cycle length @xmath197 .",
    "note that only 356 periodic orbits with @xmath198 are included in the signal ( fig .",
    "4a ) whereas the complete set of orbits with cycle length @xmath197 consists of 1377 orbits .",
    "the resonances obtained by harmonic inversion of the semiclassical recurrence function are in good agreement with results of the cycle expansion @xcite .",
    "we finally remark that when a symbolic dynamics exists and contributions of long orbits are shadowed by short orbits the cycle expansion techniques are very efficient and , e.g. , for the three disk scattering system with @xmath199 a large number of resonances can be obtained from just 8 periodic orbits with cycle length @xmath200 .",
    "again , we do not aim at competing with the efficiency of the cycle expansion method in such ideal situations . as already mentioned in section 4",
    "the advantage of periodic orbit quantization by harmonic inversion is its _ general _ applicability : it does not depend on the existence of a symbolic code and the shadowing of orbits .",
    "we have extracted the semiclassical resonances of the three disk scattering problem directly from the periodic orbits with exactly the same method as the riemann zeros in section 4 from the primes as periodic orbits , for which no symbolic dynamics exists .",
    "we have introduced harmonic inversion as a new and general tool for semiclassical periodic orbit quantization .",
    "the method requires the complete set of periodic orbits up to a given maximum period as input but does not depend on special properties of the orbits , as , e.g. , the existence of a symbolic code or a functional equation .",
    "we have demonstrated the wide applicability of the method by applying it to two systems with completely different properties , namely the zeros of the riemann zeta function and the three disk scattering problem .",
    "both systems have been treated before by efficient methods , which , however , are restricted to bound ergodic systems or systems with a complete symbolic dynamics .",
    "the harmonic inversion technique allows to solve both problems with one and the same method .",
    "therefore the method can also serve as a tool for , e.g. , the semiclassical quantization of systems with mixed regular - chaotic classical dynamics , which still is a challenging and unsolved problem .",
    "the signal @xmath161 can be composed as the sum of a signal related to the irregular part of the classical phase space with periodic orbit amplitudes given by gutzwiller s trace formula @xcite and a signal related to stable @xcite or nearly integrable @xcite torus structures .",
    "it should also be possible to include , e.g. , creeping orbits @xcite , ghost orbit contributions @xcite , and higher order @xmath10 corrections @xcite into the signal @xmath161 , which can then be inverted to reveal the semiclassical poles .",
    "the method can even be used for a semiclassical periodic orbit quantization of systems with non - homogeneous potentials such as the potential surfaces of molecules when a generalized scaling technique @xcite is applied .",
    "we are grateful to b.  eckhardt who kindly communicated to us his periodic orbits for the three disk scattering system .",
