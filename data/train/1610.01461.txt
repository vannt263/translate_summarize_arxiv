    "distributed coordination in multi - agent systems has recently gained extensive attention due to its potential applications in engineering , biological and social systems @xcite .",
    "the main goal in distributed coordinated control is to realize a group objective using local interaction between agents . from this perspective",
    ", various coordinated control algorithms for identical linear multi - agent systems described by single / mulitple integrators , linear oscillators , and more general high - order dynamics have been proposed in the literature under some specific assumptions on the interconnection between agents .",
    "examples of these results can be found in @xcite , where several methods have been proposed to solve different , yet closely - related , coordination problems including consensus , flocking , formation maintenance , cooperative tracking , and synchronization . for heterogeneous multi - agent systems ,",
    "@xcite have shown that distributed algorithms can also be derived using similar methods combined with results form the classical output regulation theory @xcite .",
    "in fact , the cooperative output regulation problem has emerged as an important problem that encapsulates many coordinated control problems of heterogeneous agents ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we consider the cooperative output regulation problem of heterogeneous linear multi - agent systems governed by the general dynamics @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 are , respectively , the state vector , the control input , and the measured output of the @xmath4-th agent , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 are matrices of appropriate dimensions , and @xmath11 is the index set of all agents .",
    "the signal @xmath12 models both the global reference signal to be tracked and the disturbance to be rejected by each agent and is generated by the following exogenous dynamic system @xmath13 with some initial states and @xmath14 being a known matrix .",
    "the objective consists in designing appropriate inputs @xmath15 such that stabilization of some regulated error signal , to be defined later , is guaranteed .",
    "clearly , in the case where all agents can sense / estimate the exogenous signal @xmath16 , the above described problem reduces to the output regulation problem of a single plant studied by @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we are interested in the case where the exogenous signal @xmath16 can be captured only by a group of informed agents whereas the other agents attempt to achieve the control objective by coordinating with other team members .",
    "basically , all agents need to reach an agreement on the estimate of the time - varying exogenous signal using local information exchange performed according to some interconnection topology . to that end , all agents are interconnected in the sense that some information can be transmitted between agents according to some graph topology .    the above problem , with its variants regarding the system model , has been addressed in @xcite , to cite a few , under different assumptions on the interconnection graph , however , under similar idealized assumptions on the interaction between agents which is generally performed using communication networks .",
    "in fact , in all the above mentioned papers , the information exchange is assumed ideal in the sense that the information is continuously transmitted between agents and received in real time . in practice , however , communication over networks is subject to time - varying delays , packets dropouts , and can be discrete - time and intermittent due to various environmental and/or technological factors .",
    "motivated by this , our main interest in this paper is to solve the cooperative output regulation problem for system assuming constrained discrete - time communication between agents .",
    "the second - order consensus problem for double integrators has been studied , for instance , in @xcite , in the presence of uniform constant communication delays . for identical higher - order linear multi - agents",
    ", @xcite presented a consensus algorithm in the presence of arbitrary large constant communication delays .",
    "a similar result was also obtained in @xcite in the case of uniform time - varying delays , however , under some conditions on the delays upper bounds and some restrictions on the dynamics of the agents .",
    "a common assumption in the above mentioned delay - robust algorithms is that the information exchange is assumed to be continuous in time and the communication delays are perfectly known . in @xcite , a consensus algorithm for high - order heterogeneous agents has been proposed assuming sampled - data information exchange subject to known constant communication delays .",
    "on the other hand , the authors in @xcite presented consensus algorithms , for linear homogeneous multi - agent systems , in the case of intermittent information exchange between agents .",
    "however , communication delays have been considered only in @xcite dealing with the second - order consensus problem under the assumptions of strong connectivity , periodic intermittent communication , and perfectly known time - varying communication delays .",
    "more recently , a small - gain framework has been adopted in @xcite to design distributed algorithms for nonlinear second - order systems in the presence of irregular communication delays .",
    "the latter approach has been further developed in @xcite to solve similar problems for second - order systems assuming delayed and ( not necessarily periodic ) intermittent discrete - time information exchange .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is a solution to the cooperative output regulation problem for heterogeneous linear multi - agent systems assuming discrete - time , intermittent and asynchronous information exchange , subject to non - uniform and unknown irregular communication delays that can be unbounded .",
    "as compared to the relevant literature mentioned above , the present work considers the coordinated control problem of high - order heterogeneous multi - agent systems by taking into account all the above communication constraints simultaneously .",
    "our control objective can be reached in the case of a general directed graph , describing the interconnection between agents , for arbitrary properties of the communication process that can induce large communication blackouts . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there is no coordinated control algorithm in the literature that takes into account ( simultaneously ) all the above mentioned communication constraints for high - order linear heterogeneous ( or identical ) multi - agent systems .",
    "consider the @xmath17 heterogenous agents in and suppose that the external signal @xmath16 , generated by , can be estimated only by some informed agents referred to as leaders .",
    "the uninformed agents , acting as followers , do not have access to the exogenous signal . without loss of generality ,",
    "let @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with @xmath20 , denote the sets of indices corresponding the followers and leaders , respectively .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the directed graph that models the interconnection between agents , where @xmath22 is the set of nodes representing the agents , @xmath23 is the set of pairs of edges , and @xmath24\\in\\mathbb{r}^{n\\times n}$ ] is the weighted adjacency matrix .",
    "an edge @xmath25 , represented by a directed link from node @xmath26 to node @xmath4 , indicates that agent @xmath4 can receive information from agent @xmath26 but not _",
    "vice versa_. a finite sequence of distinct edges of @xmath27 in the form @xmath28 is called a directed path from @xmath26 to @xmath4 . the elements of @xmath29 are defined such that @xmath30 , @xmath31 if @xmath32 , and @xmath33 if @xmath34 . the laplacian matrix @xmath35\\in\\mathbb{r}^{n\\times n}$ ] associated to @xmath27 is defined such that : @xmath36 , and @xmath37 for @xmath38 .    also , the information exchange is discrete in time and subject to irregular communication delays .",
    "more precisely , for each @xmath32 , agent @xmath26 can send data to agent @xmath4 only at instants @xmath39 , with @xmath40 and @xmath41 being a common sampling period .",
    "this information can be received by agent @xmath4 at instant @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a sequence of communication delays that take values in @xmath44 , where @xmath45 means that the corresponding data has been lost during transmission .",
    "our objective consists in designing a control algorithm for - such that the regulated error signal @xmath46 written in the general form @xmath47 satisfies @xmath48 , for @xmath49 , for arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "note that the above formulation , with @xmath50 , is general in the sense that it captures many problems relevant to multi - agent systems such as leader - follower consensus / synchronization and cooperative tracking / disturbance rejection .",

    "obviously , an infinite @xmath71 implies that communication between agents is completely lost and the cooperative output regulation problem described above may not be solved , in general . also , note that the subsequences @xmath72 and @xmath68 are defined for each edge in @xmath73 , which shows that the intermittent and delayed discrete - time information exchange described above is also asynchronous .",
