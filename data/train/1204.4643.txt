    "_ gravity probe b _ ( ) is the spaceborne relativity experiment developed by nasa and stanford university to test two predictions of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the experiment used four superconducting gyroscopes , contained in a low - altitude , polar orbiting spacecraft , to measure the geodetic effect and the much smaller frame - dragging effect . according to gr",
    ", each of these effects induces precessions of the gyroscopes .",
    "the predicted precession is 6.6 arcsecyr@xmath3 for the geodetic effect and 39 milliarcsecondsyr@xmath3 ( ) for the frame - dragging effect .",
    "was designed to measure the precessions with a standard error @xmath40.5  relative to distant inertial space .",
    "this space may be closely linked to the extragalactic international celestial reference frame ( icrf ) , which is based on radio very - long - baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) measurements @xcite .",
    "because of technical limitations , the spacecraft could not measure the precessions relative to such a frame directly , but rather only to an optically bright star .",
    "the proper motion of this chosen `` guide star , '' ( = hr  8703 ; hd  216489 ; fk5  3829 ) , was independently determined using vlbi measurements made relative to a fiducial point in the quasar ( = 4c  15.76 ; qso j2253 + 1608 ) .",
    "two other radio sources , and , are used as secondary reference sources to set a limit on the stability of the fiducial point .",

    "its milliarcsecond - scale structure has been extensively studied with vlbi . at radio frequencies between",
    "1.7  ghz and 15  ghz , the structure of 3c  454.3 consists of a bright , relatively compact ( unresolved ) core region and an extended one - sided jet which is directed west - southwest near the core region and bends to the northwest @xmath25  mas from the core region ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath25  yr vlbi observing program at 10.7  ghz of @xcite traced the motions of four compact components which emerged from the core region and moved at superluminal apparent speeds in the range 59@xmath1 along the curved path of the jet . and a friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology with @xmath6 and @xmath7 . ]",
    "the results at 5 and 8.4  ghz by @xcite give for one particular component a mean motion between 1983 and 1991 of @xmath217@xmath1 . at frequencies of 22 and 43  ghz , the core region itself",
    "is resolved into two principal components oriented approximately east - west and separated by @xmath20.6  mas ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , observations at 43  ghz reveal that new components are occasionally ejected from the easternmost core - region component and move toward the westernmost core - region component with superluminal speeds anywhere in the range 313@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the easternmost component is very compact at 43  ghz ( @xmath40.1  mas full - width - at - half - maximum : fwhm ) and is considered at that frequency to be the `` core , '' though its stationarity with respect to a celestial reference frame ( e.g. , the icrf ) has not been determined .",
    "the stationarity of a spatially related component at 8.4  ghz has recently been determined relative to an updated celestial reference frame ( crf ) , defined by @xmath24000 compact extragalactic radio sources ( see paper  iii ; @xcite ) .",

    "in fact , only a handful of vlbi images of b2250 + 194 have been produced by others , and mostly as part of the united states naval observatory s astrometry program and the very long baseline array s ( vlba s ) calibrator survey @xcite .",
    "these images show that the source is only partially resolved at both 2.3 and 8.4  ghz on intercontinental baselines .",

    "[ conclus ] .",
    "the principal astrometric requirements for our vlbi reference sources are that they be ( 1 ) radio bright and compact , ( 2 ) in close proximity on the sky to i m  peg , and ( 3 ) extragalactic in origin , with a core , or other structural reference point , stationary on the sky to a very high degree .",
    "these requirements are consistent with those of targeted astrometric vlbi experiments employing phase referencing ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to summarize briefly",
    ", phase referencing requires that the reference source be detected in scans @xmath21  minute or less in length , so that the interferometric phase delay , which changes with time , often very rapidly , can be successfully interpolated to scans of the target source . for this reason",
    ", the phase reference source must have a correlated flux density @xmath9100  mjy , i.e. , a flux density of at least this magnitude arising from a sufficiently compact emission region .",
    "similarly , since the phase delay can change significantly with pointing direction , due mainly to radio propagation through the troposphere and ionosphere , the reference source should be located within @xmath21  of the target source .",
    "finally , if the morphology of the reference source is variable between observing sessions , then a point must be identified within the source image at every session that may confidently be assumed to be a ( nearly ) stationary feature of the source over the time spanned by our observing program .",
    "the quasar 3c  454.3 is the only radio source which has both a correlated flux density @xmath10100  mjy and a relatively compact , milliarcsecond - scale structure within 1  of i m  peg ( see figure  [ foursourcepos ] ) .",
    "furthermore , 3c  454.3 was used as the only reference source for i m  peg in the phase - referenced mapping vlbi observations made for the hipparcos frame - tie project from 1991 to 1994 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "our continued observation of 3c  454.3 therefore provides a long time baseline for the guide - star proper - motion measurement . on the other hand ,",
    "3c  454.3 is a classic superluminal source with , in general , moving jet components . without the benefit of a detailed and evolving model of its radio structure , the position accuracy of 3c  454.3",
    "is limited ( in the icrf of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to @xmath21.5  mas , which is not quite sufficient to yield proper motions to within the @xmath20.1  standard error desired for",
    ". however , since our astrometric vlbi observations were designed so that we could produce high quality images of our reference sources , we can identify a point in 3c  454.3 which is stationary on the sky to a much higher degree .",
    "all things considered , 3c  454.3 was the best choice to be our phase reference and main astrometric reference source .",
    "the quasar b2250 + 194 is the next closest radio source on the sky to i m  peg which has a flux density @xmath10100  mjy and is compact on milliarcsecond scales . indeed , b2250 + 194 has a more compact structure and displays more limited structural changes than 3c  454.3 , as evidenced by the accuracy to which its position is measured in the icrf ( @xmath20.3  mas ;",
    "see * ? ? ?",
    ". however , at a separation on the sky from i m  peg of 2.9  ( see figure  [ foursourcepos ] ) , its use as the primary astrometric reference could have introduced large errors in the stellar proper - motion measurement ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , on the basis of its compact structure and `` reasonably '' small sky separation from i m  peg , we selected b2250 + 194 to be a secondary reference source .",
    "the radio source b2252 + 172 is very compact and favorably located within @xmath22  of , and approximately along the same north - south axis as , 3c  454.3 , b2250 + 194 , and i m  peg ( see figure  [ foursourcepos ] ) .",
    "b2252 + 172 is relatively weak ( @xmath220  mjy at 8.4  ghz ) , and was discovered only recently by the nvss . in light of its low centimetric spectral index , we assume that b2252 + 172 is also extragalactic , even though its @xmath11 optical counterpart is so faint that no spectrum has yet been obtained for it .",
    "we selected b2252 + 172 to serve as an additional reference source and astrometric check source , since its north - south alignment with 3c  454.3 , b2250 + 194 , and i m  peg helps to better model propagation - medium effects .",
    "we carried out 35 sessions of 8.4  ghz ( @xmath12  cm ) vlbi observations of the  guide star i m  peg between 1997 january and 2005 july using a global vlbi array of between 12 and 16 telescopes ( see below ) .",
    "the considerations governing the scheduling of the observing sessions are outlined in paper  v @xcite . for each session",
    ", we interleaved observations ( `` scans '' ) of i m  peg with those of our references sources so that we could employ the phase - referencing technique ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to determine an accurate astrometric position for i m  peg .",
    "the phase reference source for all sessions was 3c  454.3 .",
    "b2250 + 194 was also observed during all sessions .",
    "b2252 + 172 was included for the final 12 sessions , starting in 2002 november .",
    "we give the sky coordinates for each reference source in paper  iii .",
    "our global vlbi array for each set of observations included the ten 25-m vlba telescopes and , for increased sensitivity to the relatively weak i m  peg ( flux density 0.280  mjy ; see paper  v ) , two or more of the following large - aperture telescopes : the phased very large array ( vla ) , the 100-m effelsberg telescope , the 43-m green bank telescope , the 46-m algonquin radio observatory telescope , and the three 70-m nasa - jpl deep space network ( dsn ) telescopes .",
    "the total observing time after data editing and calibration for each session was 1115 hr . during each session , we switched between i m  peg and each of the reference sources with a cycle time of between 5.5 and 7.3 minutes , in which i m  peg",
    "was observed for a minimum of 120 seconds , 3c  454.3 and b2250 + 194 for approximately 60 seconds each , and b2252 + 172 ( when included ) for approximately 75 seconds .",
    "the data were recorded with either the vlba or mark iii system with sampling rates of 112 , 128 , or 256 @xmath13 , and were correlated with the nrao vlba processor in socorro , new mexico . at most epochs ,",
    "both right - hand and left - hand circular polarizations were recorded .",
    "the specific characteristics of each set of observations are given in table  [ antab ] .",
    "for our session on 2004 may  18 , we observed i m  peg and the three reference sources at 5.0  ghz ( @xmath14  cm ) and 15.4  ghz ( @xmath15  cm ) in addition to using our standard frequency of 8.4  ghz .",
    "we observed for @xmath22  hr at 8.4  ghz at the start of the observations , alternated @xmath240  minute observing cycles at each of the three frequencies for the next @xmath28  hr , observed at 8.4  ghz again for an extended period of @xmath24  hr , and returned to the @xmath240  minute cycle of three frequencies for the remaining @xmath22  hr .",
    "we used the vla as a stand - alone interferometer ( in addition to using it as an element of our vlbi array ) for most of our sessions in order to monitor the variability of the total flux density and total circular polarization of i m  peg over the course of the 1115 hr observing sessions . to set the flux - density scale for each set of vla observations , we used one or both of the flux - density calibrator sources 3c  286 and 3c  48 , with flux densities defined on the scale of @xcite .",
    "we assume a standard error of @xmath25% in the vla - determined flux densities at each session .",
    "the range of values for the total flux density of i m  peg for each session , as well as the radio light curves in total intensity and total fractional circular polarization for a selected sample of sessions , are presented in paper  vii @xcite .",
    "the flux densities0.2  mjy arcsecond - scale jet . ] of reference sources 3c  454.3 , b2250 + 194 , and b2252 + 172 for each session are given in table  [ fluxdensities ] .",

    "the proper motion of j1 ( see figure  [ j1andextc1relpos ] ) , though approximately uniform in @xmath21 , changed in @xmath22 between the first 26 epochs ( @xmath26.5  yr ) and the remaining nine epochs ( @xmath22.0  yr ) .",
    "fitting to each time period separately , we determined the relative proper motion in @xmath22 to decrease from @xmath287  for the first 26 epochs to @xmath288  for the remaining nine .",
    "the result for the first 26 epochs suggests that the northward bend in the jet that starts at a position @xmath23  mas west of c1 , i.e. , at a position between transient components d1 and d2 , continues to a position @xmath25.6  mas west of c1 .",
    "the rapid change at this point in the direction of the proper motion may signify a second sharp bend in the jet .",

    "this result is consistent with the 1.7  ghz space - vlbi observations of @xcite , which showed for an epoch in 1999 june that the extended jet region was composed of 3 or 4 components .",
    "moreover , the decrease in the major - axis length ( fwhm ) of the `` moving '' jext from @xmath27.3  mas to @xmath25.9  mas ( see table  [ 3cextjetcomp ] ) suggests that no `` new '' component transited from the inner - jet region to the extended - jet region during our @xmath28.5  yr observing period .",
    "component j1 , as discussed above , may have been close to this transition near the end of our program .",
    "we note that the major axis of jext is approximately aligned with the axis of the arcsecond - scale jet of 3c  454.3 ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we repeated the simulation study described here for non - typical instances of our  coverage ( 1997 january  18 , 2002 april  14 , and 2002 november  20 ) and found flux - density and position variations for the 3c  454.3 model components consistent with the uncertainties derived here for the typical coverage . ]  coverage and consisting of the fourier transforms of simple geometrical models similar to 3c  454.3 as described in ",
    "[ coreregion]  [ outerjetregion ] .",
    "each variation of the model used different positions and flux densities for the two bright core - region components ( c1 and c2 ) , and in a few cases also used different positions and flux densities for the weaker components ( d1 , d2 , j1 , and jext ) .",
    "we fourier - inverted the simulated data for each variation and used the clean deconvolution algorithm to produce images .",
    "we subsequently compared to the input models the resulting simulated images and new models fit to the simulated images .",
    "( the new model , or `` output '' model , contains the same number and type of components as the input model . ) for each variation of the input model , we found the model structure to be reasonably well reproduced in the simulated images ( taking into account the size and orientation of the clean restoring beam ) , but noted that additional `` ripples '' were present in the core region with peak - to - peak amplitudes of 13% of the image peak and in the inner - jet and extended - jet regions with amplitudes of 0.21% of the image peak .",
    "the fourier counterparts of these ripples occur at spatial frequencies just outside the bulk of the  coverage .",
    "the maximum fraction ( considering several variations of the input model ) of the rms flux density in ripples near the positions of the input - model components to the flux density in the components themselves was @xmath25% for the core - region components ( c1 and c2 ) and extended - jet component ( jext ) and @xmath210% for the compact - jet components ( d1 , d2 , and j1 ) .",
    "when we compared the flux densities of the output - model components to those of the input - model components , we found corresponding differences of up to @xmath25% for c1 , c2 , and jext and @xmath210% for d1 , d2 , and j1 .",
    "we therefore take these values ( @xmath25% for each of c1 , c2 , and jext and @xmath210% for each of d1 , d2 , and j1 ) as a conservative estimate of the fractional flux - density uncertainty due to deconvolution errors . to estimate the amount by which the ripples affect the positions of the model components , we compared the positions of the output and input model components for each variation .",
    "we found the maximum difference between the output and input component positions to be @xmath20.020  mas for c1 and c2 ( @xmath20.015  mas in @xmath21 and @xmath20.010  mas in @xmath22 ) , @xmath20.100  mas for d1 ( @xmath20.080  mas in @xmath21 and @xmath20.050  mas in @xmath22 ) , @xmath20.070  mas for d2 and j1 ( @xmath20.050  mas in each coordinate ) , and @xmath20.040  mas for jext ( @xmath20.030  mas in each coordinate ) .",
    "we take the maximum difference between the positions of the output and input model components quoted above as conservative estimates of the various position uncertainties due to deconvolution errors .    as a second reliability test we used another deconvolution algorithm , namely the maximum entropy method ( mem",
    "; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to produce images of 3c  454.3 at select epochs .",
    "we then performed the same fits in the image plane as described in   [ coreregion]  [ outerjetregion ] .",
    "we found that the differences in the position determinations of the relevant components in the mem deconvolved images compared to the clean deconvolved images were well within the limits given above .",
    "we also performed an analysis of the changing 8.4  ghz radio structure of 3c  454.3 via model fitting in the  plane .",
    "fitting in the plane is not affected by deconvolution errors ( as described in   [ deconv ] ) and is not as sensitive to differences from epoch to epoch in the precise  coverage . on the other hand ,",
    "we can not , given our  coverage , simultaneously constrain the high - flux - density components in the core region and the low - flux - density or low - surface - brightness components in the inner - jet and extended - jet regions .",
    "we fit to the  data at each epoch a model consisting of three point sources , which describe , approximately , the core - region components c1 and c2 as well as the compact jet component j1 ( see   [ implanefits ] ) . for comparison with the image - plane models , we plot in figure  [ uvrelpos ] the separations in the -plane model of @xmath294 and @xmath295 ( top panels ) and @xmath296 and @xmath295 ( bottom panels ) .",
    "the proper motion of @xmath294 with respect to @xmath295 is consistent with that found in the image - plane analysis .",
    "the proper motion of @xmath296 with respect to @xmath295 differs at the 1.5@xmath154 level from that found in the image - plane analysis .",
    "this difference may result from structural changes in the unmodeled extended jet over the @xmath28.5  yr period of our observing program .",
    "given the limitations of the -plane - based analysis for 3c  454.3 , we believe our image - plane models ( see   [ implanefits ] ) provide the better overall description of the evolving structure of this source .",
    "we present in figure  [ 3cimagescxu ] the 5.0 , 8.4 , and 15.4  ghz images of 3c  454.3 generated from our nearly simultaneous vlbi observations on 2004 may  18 ( see   [ obs ] ) .",
    "the 8.4  ghz image is the same as that presented in figure  [ 3cimages ] except for the choice of contour levels .",
    "the images are aligned on the center of the easternmost component of the radio structure ( see below ) .",
    "the image characteristics are given in table  [ 3cimstat ] .",
    "the 5.0 and 15.4  ghz images are slightly noisier than the 8.4  ghz image , mainly because the total time on source was @xmath24  hr at each of 5.0 and 15.4  ghz compared to @xmath27  hr at 8.4  ghz .",
    "nevertheless , the images at all three frequencies show a core region extended nearly east - west and a jet bending toward the north .",
    "to quantitatively compare the positions and flux densities of the core- and inner - jet - region components , we fit to the combined core / inner - jet region in each of the 5.0 and 15.4  ghz images the three - component model ( c1 , c2 , and d1 ) described in   [ innerjetregion ] .",
    "similarly , to compare the positions and flux densities of the extended - jet - region component(s ) , we fit to the extended - jet region in the 5.0  ghz image the two - component model ( j1 and jext ) described in   [ outerjetregion ] .",
    "however , at 15.4  ghz we fit only a single point source ( j1 ) to the region within @xmath22  mas of the jet peak , because the surface brightness of the extended jet in this image is too low to allow us to adequately constrain an elliptical gaussian component .",
    "the results of the fits are given in table  [ 3ccompcxu ] and illustrated in figure  [ 3cimagescxu ] .",
    "the uncertainties in the flux densities and positions include contributions , added in quadrature , of the statistical standard error of the fit and an estimate ( using an analysis similar to that described in   [ deconv ] ) of the systematic error associated with deconvolution errors in the corresponding image .",

    "but how well do the images at 5.0 , 8.4 , and 15.4  ghz actually line - up ? to answer this question we look at the separation of j1 and c1 at each frequency .",
    "the jet peak is clearly identified at each frequency , and thus serves as a useful marker in the radio structure .",
    "the largest difference between the three images in the j1c1 separation ( see the last four columns of table  [ 3ccompcxu ] ) is @xmath309  mas in @xmath21 and @xmath310  mas in @xmath22 .",
    "we therefore believe that the images at 5.0 , 8.4 , and 15.4  ghz are aligned ( relative to these internal reference points ) to within 0.10  mas in @xmath21 and 0.15  mas in @xmath22 ; i.e. , to better than @xmath215% of the resolution of the 5.0  ghz image .    the separations of c2 and d1 from c1 are more variable with frequency than the separation of j1 from c1 .",
    "this difference is not surprising considering the complexity of the underlying structure in the core and inner - jet regions .",
    "the @xmath21.8 times higher angular resolution of the 15.4  ghz image , compared to that of the 8.4  ghz image , reveals that the core and inner - jet regions for 2004 may  18 contain more than three components .",
    "specifically , there appears to be a component located between the positions of c1 and c2 , and another component located west - southwest of the position of c2 .",
    "can we understand the differences in the fit - estimated c2c1 and d1c1 separations at each frequency in terms of the frequency - dependent flux densities of these unmodeled components ? generally speaking ,",
    "the spectral index , @xmath21 ( @xmath311 ) , of a component is steeper ( i.e. , more negative ) the farther west it is from the core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , relative to c1 and c2 , a component lying between them will likely have a larger fractional flux density at 15.4  ghz than at 8.4 or 5.0  ghz , while a component west of c2 will have a larger fractional flux density at 5.0  ghz than at either 8.4 or 15.4  ghz .",
    "these flux - density differences would create at 15.4  ghz a `` plateau '' between c1 and c2 ( as observed ) and at 5.0  ghz a west - broadened c2 . for a core - region modeled only by c1 and c2",
    ", we might then expect a c2c1 separation which is smaller at 15.4  ghz than at 5.0  ghz .",
    "this is indeed what we find in our model fits ( see table  [ 3ccompcxu ] ) . in the inner - jet region ,",
    "the situation is reversed . here",
    ", the component west - southwest of c2 might be expected to create at 5.0  ghz a plateau between c2 and d1 , and yield a d1c1 separation which is smaller at this frequency than at 15.4  ghz .",
    "these expectations , too , are confirmed by our model fits .",
    "we give in table  [ 3cspeccxu ] the flux - density ratio ( @xmath312 ) and resulting point - to - point spectral index ( @xmath313 ) for each model component for each pair of frequencies .",
    "we also give for comparison the total ( clean ) flux - density ratio ( using the values in table  [ 3cimstat ] ) and resulting point - to - point spectral index for each pair of frequencies .",
    "note that to compute the standard errors in the flux densities , we added in quadrature to the other contributions a 5% uncertainty representative of the standard error in the vlbi flux - density scale . we adopt a 5% uncertainty for this epoch rather than the nominal 10% ( see   [ vlbiamp ] ) , because the vlbi- and vla - determined flux densities at each frequency differ by only 27% ( see table  [ 3cimstat ] ) . the slightly lower ratio of vlbi - determined to vla - determined flux density at 5.0  ghz compared to those at 8.4 and 15.4  ghz is likely due to the insensitivity of our vlbi observations to low - surface - brightness ( and steep - spectral - index ) emission in the extended jet at distances @xmath915  mas northwest of the core ( see * ? ? ?",

    "( 3 ) @xcite find for a component located @xmath21.5  mas west - southwest of the core a spectral index of @xmath350 .",
    "our spectral - index estimates for d1 ( @xmath21 @xmath351 @xmath352 to @xmath353 ) are roughly consistent with this value , but again suggest that components between c2 and d1 are contributing fractionally more flux density to d1 at 5.0 and 8.4  ghz than at 15.4  ghz .",
    "in contrast to the core and inner - jet regions , the extended - jet region appears to be reasonably well represented by our two - component model at 5.0 and 8.4  ghz , and likewise the ( immediate ) jet - peak region by our one - component model at 15.4  ghz .",
    "our estimates of the spectral index of j1 ( @xmath21 @xmath351 @xmath354 to @xmath355 ) are self - consistent and also consistent with the spectral index ( @xmath350 ) estimated by @xcite for a component approximately @xmath25.5  mas west of the core .",
    "we note that the lower - level structure extending west of j1 in the 15.4  ghz image is likely real , and not a noise spike or sidelobe of one of the bright core - region components .",
    "its appearance is robust against changes ( e.g. , to the positioning of clean windows ) in the imaging process .",
    "the east - west extension at j1 at all three frequencies is , perhaps , a consequence of a near superposition of jet components undergoing the change in trajectory described in   [ outerjetregion ] .",

    ", the 8.4  ghz brightness peak is very nearly aligned with the center of c1 . over the next several epochs , the brightness peak moves westward , and by 2005 january  15 is very nearly aligned with the center of c2 . if we assume that the brightening in 2003 september  8 temporally coincides ( within @xmath212 months ) with the ejection of a new component from the `` core , '' then we may interpret the subsequent shifts in the position of the brightness peak as roughly tracking the motion of the new component between the positions defined by c1 and c2 .",
    "the total transit time , using 2003 september  8 as the epoch of ejection and 2005 january  15 as the epoch of arrival , is @xmath21.4  yr . the 2004 may  18 epoch represents the approximate mid - point of this interval .",
    "we present in figure  [ 2250imagesplot ] the 8.4  ghz images of b2250 + 194 generated from each of the 35 sessions of vlbi observations made between 1997  january and 2005  july .",
    "the image characteristics are summarized in table  [ 2250imstat ] .",
    "the images reveal a relatively compact source . near the brightness peak",
    ", the source shows no deviation from the restoring beam , down to the @xmath210% level . below this level , i.e. , at the brightness level of the outermost five or six contours , the source shows a distinct `` kidney - bean '' shape : the northern portion of the source bends @xmath230  to the west , while the southern portion of the source bends @xmath210 to the west .",
    "other than the @xmath225% increase in the peak brightness over the @xmath28.5  yr period of our observing program , there is no significant indication of radio structure evolution in the images . the low - level kidney - bean structure may trace ( 1 ) continuous emission along a single , bent jet , ( 2 ) emission from well - separated regions in a single , bent jet viewed nearly straight on , or ( 3 ) emission from a pair of bent ( or at least not quite counter - aligned ) jets .",
    "if scenario 1 were correct , then the core of the quasar could be located at either the north or south end of the source , and the centrally - located brightness peak would be a bright jet component . if , on the other hand , scenario 2 or 3 were correct , then the brightness peak could be nearly aligned with the core .",

    "<S> we used 8.4  ghz vlbi images obtained at up to 35 epochs between 1997 and 2005 to examine the radio structures of the main reference source , 3c  454.3 , and two secondary reference sources , b2250 + 194 and b2252 + 172 , for the guide star for the nasa / stanford relativity mission _ gravity probe b _ ( ) . for one epoch in 2004 may , we also obtained images at 5.0 and 15.4  ghz . the 35 8.4  ghz images for quasar 3c  454.3 confirm a complex , evolving , core - jet structure . </S>",
    "<S> we identified at each epoch a component , c1 , near the easternmost edge of the core region . </S>",
    "<S> simulations of the core region showed that c1 is located , on average , @xmath0  mas west of the unresolved `` core '' identified in 43  ghz images . </S>",
    "<S> we also identified in 3c  454.3 at 8.4  ghz several additional components which moved away from c1 with proper motions ranging in magnitude between 0.9@xmath1 and 5@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed motions of the components exhibit two distinct bends in the jet axis located @xmath23 and @xmath25.5  mas west of c1 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra between 5.0 and 15.4  ghz for the `` moving '' components are steeper than that for c1 . </S>",
    "<S> the 8.4  ghz images of b2250 + 194 and b2252 + 172 , in contrast to those of 3c  454.3 , reveal compact structures . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum between 5.0 and 15.4  ghz for b2250 + 194 is inverted while that for b2252 + 172 is flat .    </S>",
    "<S> based on its position near the easternmost edge of the 8.4  ghz radio structure , close spatial association with the 43  ghz core , and relatively flat spectrum , we believe 3c  454.3 component c1 to be the best choice for the ultimate reference point for the  guide star . the compact structures and inverted to flat spectra of b2250 + 194 and b2252 + 172 make these objects valuable secondary reference sources . </S>"
