    "the discovery of topological phases in non - interacting electron band structures has resulted in a wealth of interesting new systems  @xcite . for materials with fully gapped bands , it is possible to define a topological invariant that determines the number of protected surface states  @xcite and the quantized value of response functions such as the hall conductivity in integer quantum hall systems  @xcite or the magnetoelectric effect in strong topological insulators@xcite .",
    "the invariant underlies the precise quantization of these response functions and the robustness of the surface states , since its value does not change as long as the bandgap does not close .",
    "in addition to fully gapped insulators and superconductors , however , topological phases can occur in gapless systems when the bulk nodal structures are themselves protected  @xcite .",
    "this occurs in weyl semimetals , where the bulk bands touch at separated pairs of points in the brillouin zone known as weyl nodes . in 3d , these nodes are robust to gap - opening perturbations .",
    "they behave like monopoles of berry curvature and can only be removed by pairwise annihilation when two nodes with oppositely charged monopoles merge  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the monopole is the topological invariant underlying a pair of weyl nodes , and is determined by the berry flux through a closed 2d surface in momentum space that encloses a single node .",
    "similar to the bulk invariant in gapped topological phases , the bulk weyl nodes are manifested physically as surface states displaying fermi arcs and an anomalous hall effect  @xcite .",
    "weyl nodes have been proposed to exist in the a phase  @xcite of @xmath1he and recently in several materials including pyrochlore iridates  @xcite , topological insulator - ferromagnet multilayers  @xcite , and hgcr@xmath2se@xmath3  @xcite .    in superconductors ,",

    "cept@xmath4si is one such noncentrosymmetric superconductor in which spin - orbit coupling is proposed to result in a mixed singlet - triplet pairing .",
    "the stability of line nodes in this material has been attributed to a non - trivial topological invariant of a 1d loop in momentum space enclosing the nodal line .",
    "the system has surface states with unusual flat bands in a certain range of momentum determined by the bulk line nodes .    in this work",
    "we extend the understanding of topological phases in nodal superconductors to systems with point nodes that break time - reversal symmetry  @xcite .",
    "specifically we study a superconducting model with double - weyl nodes ( with monopole strength of 2 ) and protected surface states displaying fermi arcs .",
    "the model consists of a double - weyl semimetal stabilized by @xmath5 point - group symmetry , and superconducting pairing terms that preserve the point - group symmetry .",
    "to argue that the nodes and surface states are protected , we derive a topological invariant for the superconductor . for a weyl phase the calculation has two steps",

    "we derive a simple way to carry out each step using changes in the symmetry eigenvalues along high - symmetry momentum ( hsm ) lines in the brillouin zone .",
    "interestingly , we find that the invariant for the superconducting weyl nodes is determined by the fermi surface topology of the normal state .",
    "fermi surface topology studies have been previously used to characterize fully gapped , tri superconductors  @xcite .",
    "for example , the @xmath6 invariant of a gapped , odd - parity tri superconductor is determined by the number of tri momenta enclosed by the fermi surface  @xcite .",
    "we extend these fermi surface studies to the time - reversal - breaking gapless structure of weyl phases .",
    "the method is applied to a superconducting system whose pairing vanishes on hsm lines , as the @xmath0-invariant pairings do . in this case , finding bulk nodes in the superconductor becomes equivalent to finding the intersections of hsm lines with the fermi surface of the parent material .",

    ", the hamiltonian near the weyl nodes can be written as @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath9 in front of the last term indicates that the two nodes have opposite chirality .",
    "any further perturbation commutes with at least one term in the hamiltonian , and thus can only shift the location of the nodes but can not open a gap .",
    "the existence of weyl nodes requires either time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) or inversion to be broken , and in this work we consider systems without trs .",
    "weyl nodes are topological defects in momentum space .",
    "similar to vortices in real space , they may annihilate pair - wise but are individually robust .",
    "it is desirable to find a topological invariant underlying a pair of weyl nodes analogous to the vorticity of a vortex pair .",
    "because of the presence of bulk nodes , a topological invariant can not be well - defined over the full 3d brillouin zone .",
    "instead it is useful to consider a lower dimensional subset of the brillouin zone that surrounds the nodal region . since the subset is chosen by design to avoid the nodes , the system constrained to the subset is fully gapped .",
    "a topological invariant is defined on this lower dimensional subset so that a non - trivial value of the invariant indicates enclosed nodes .",
    "the robustness of this invariant ensures that the nodes can not be eliminated except across quantum phase transitions .",
    "gapless phases are therefore protected by topological invariants of lower dimensional subsets that enclose the nodal region .",
    "topological phases have been classified into a periodic table that predicts the invariants allowed for a given spatial dimension and symmetry class .",
    "we use this classification to first review the topological nature of tri superconductors with nodal lines , then analyze superconductors with point nodes . in tri superconductors , the hamiltonian on generic subsets of the brillouin zone breaks both trs and particle - hole symmetry ( phs ) .",
    "however the hamiltonian satisfies a chiral symmetry defined as the product of trs and phs , and thus belongs to symmetry class aiii which has a non - trivial integer - valued invariant  @xcite in 1d .",
    "nodal lines can be surrounded by a 1d loop in momentum - space and are protected by the 1d invariant ( fig .",
    "[ nodalline ] ) .",
    "furthermore the surface states of the superconductor correspond to the non - trivial edge states on the 1d momentum subset , which are zero - energy states .",
    "these flat surface bands may seem surprising in a 3d system , but should be thought of as the edge modes of the 1d topological phase that is protected by the nodal line  @xcite .",
    "next we turn to superconductors with weyl nodes and show the stability of those that break time - reversal .",
    "weyl nodes are point nodes that are enclosed by a 2d subset of the brillouin zone ( fig .",
    "[ nodalpoint ] ) .",
    "class aiii has no non - trivial 2d topological invariant , so point nodes are unstable in tri superconductors .",
    "for this reason , breaking inversion while preserving trs is insufficient for a weyl superconductor , though of course it is possible that additional symmetries may stabilize it .    for superconductors that break trs",
    ", the hamiltonian on generic subsets of the brillouin zone again breaks trs and phs . in this case",
    "there is no additional chiral symmetry , so the hamiltonian on the subsets belongs to class a. the existence of a 2d topological invariant in class a makes weyl nodes in trs - breaking superconductors stable .",
    "the surface states correspond to the edge states of non - trivial 2d systems in class a , which are chiral and have linear dispersion .",
    "we verify this for the model studied in sec .",
    "[ sec : pairing ] .",
    "weyl nodes in superconductors breaking trs therefore do no need additional symmetries to be stabilized .",
    "our argument is in agreement with a previous microscopic calculation  @xcite showing that superconducting weyl nodes are unstable in trs systems but stable when trs is broken . in this work",
    "we use certain point - group symmetries to express the corresponding topological invariant in a simple way , though they are not necessary for the existence of the nodes .",
    "we now show that symmetry eigenvalues can define a topological invariant even in the presence of generic bulk gap closings .",
    "consider a two - band model @xmath10 where @xmath11 are functions of momentum @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are pauli matrices in a basis of spin , orbital , or spin - orbit - coupled degrees of freedom .",
    "a point group operator @xmath14 for a @xmath7 , or @xmath15-fold , rotation about the @xmath16- axis maps @xmath12 to @xmath17 . in this work",
    "we consider a @xmath5 symmetry consisting of a combined 4-fold rotation about the @xmath16-axis and mirror reflection about the @xmath18-plane , which take @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "a system that preserves this symmetry obeys @xmath21 without loss of generality , consider the case where the point - group operator is represented by @xmath22 .",
    "this leads to the following contstraints on the coefficients of the pauli matrices :    @xmath23    @xmath24    we define high - symmetry momentum ( hsm ) points @xmath25 as points in momentum space left invariant under the symmetry operator : @xmath26 .",

    "the hamiltonian at hsm commutes with the symmetry operator , so each energy band can be characterized by eigenvalues of the symmetry operator , @xmath32 : @xmath33 the eigenvalue @xmath34 changes sign only when @xmath35 goes to 0 , _ ie _ , when the energy gap closes at one of the hsm . the product of symmetry eigenvalues , @xmath36 , can be used to define phases as regions of constant @xmath37 separated by gap closings at @xmath25 .",
    "since the @xmath34 are defined only at hsm @xmath38 , they do not change when the gap closes at non - high - symmetry points .",
    "therefore @xmath37 is a robust invariant even in the presence of bulk gap closings , as long as they occur away from @xmath38 .",
    "in addition to defining a robust invariant for nodal systems , the symmetry eigenvalues can be used to detect and classify the nodes themselves .",
    "consider rotation - invariant momentum lines , for example @xmath39 or @xmath40 for @xmath0-invariant systems . along a fixed @xmath41 , unequal values of @xmath42 at @xmath43 and @xmath44 indicate that the gap has closed at some value of @xmath45 in between .",

    "the key difference is that the gap - closing occurs at @xmath60 in the semimetal and @xmath61 in the superconductor . for superconductors",
    "whose pairing vanishes on rotationally - invariant momemtum lines , the latter condition has a simple physical meaning in terms of the normal ( non - superconducting ) material .",
    "it marks the intersection of the parent fermi surface with the rotationally - invariant momentum lines .",
