    "the near - earth object 2008 tc@xmath0 was a small fast rotating asteroid ( discovered by r.a .",
    "kowalski , catalina sky survey ) , which impacted the earth on october 7 , 2008 .",
    "this extraordinary object was discovered and then tracked for about 20 h before its collision .",
    "it was approaching at rather small speed of about @xmath1 km / s .",
    "periodic light variation indicated the fast rotation of the object ( period about 1.5 min ) in a complex , non - principal axis ( `` tumbling '' ) state @xcite .",
    "2008  tc@xmath0 entered the atmosphere at 02:46 utc and exploded 37 km above northern sudan . the first prediction ( s.r .",
    "chesley , jpl ) indicated explosion and a rain of small meteorites .",
    "as expected number of small fragments was found .",
    "a total of about 600 fragments ( 10.5 kg ) were collected @xcite .",
    "the meteorites were later identified as ureilites .",
    "collision probability computations and impact prediction were performed at the university of pisa ( italy ) and jet propulsion laboratory ( usa ) .",
    "preliminary orbit computation immediately indicated collision with the earth , and subsequent `` follow - up '' observations were performed , finally gathering a total of 570 astrometric observations from 26 different observatories .",
    "neodys ( pisa ) lists five other independent possible previous close approaches of 2008  tc@xmath0 with the earth and one with mars .",
    "four of which have the probability approaching @xmath2% and one approaching @xmath3% . in sect .",
    "2 we describe the methods used for computing orbits and collision probability . in sect .",
    "3 we present our results and sect .",
    "4 contains conclusions .",
    "an outline of the bayesian treatment of the orbital inverse problem can be found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "the solution to the orbital inverse problem can be written as an a posteriori probability , using bayes theorem :    @xmath4    where :    * @xmath5 is the a priori probability density function ( p.d.f . ) , * @xmath6 is the observational error p.d.f .",

    "pairs : @xmath14 .    to keep @xmath15 invariant in transformations from one orbital element set to another , one can use , for example , jeffreys a priori p.d.f .",
    "@xcite : @xmath16    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the information matrix ( or the inverse covariance matrix ) evaluated for the local orbital elements @xmath9 , @xmath19 contains the partial derivatives of r.a . and dec .",
    "with respect to the orbital elements , and @xmath20 is the covariance matrix for the observational errors . for details of asteroid orbital inversion theory ,",
    "refer to the extensive literature available @xcite . to characterize the complicated a posteriori target densities",
    ", we use monte - carlo methods . in particular , we focus on the markov - chain monte - carlo ranging technique .",
    "markov - chain monte - carlo ( mcmc ) ranging @xcite is a nonlinear orbital sampling technique that combines the monte - carlo ( mc ) ranging method and metropolis - hastings ( mh ) algorithm .",
    "in contrast to mc ranging , in mcmc ranging the sampling is guided , with a help of arbitrary proposal density ( here we use multi - normal proposal density ) for inversion parameters .",
    "subsequent orbits result in a chain ( markov chain ) of samples which are not independent . as inversion parameters",
    "the spherical coordinates @xmath21 at two chosen observation dates a and b are used .",
    "multivariate gaussian proposal distribution @xmath22 ( describing the transition probability from last accepted spherical coordinates @xmath23 to candidate spherical coordinates @xmath24 ) is adopted for candidate orbit sampling . in particular , here we use multi - normal proposal distribution with highly correlated ranges @xmath25 and @xmath26 , as such a correlation is very often a case for short observational arcs @xcite ( also see fig .",
    "[ ranges ] ) . as the number of observations and observational time interval increases , the ranges distribution become more confined and less correlated .",
    "this simple proposal distribution in spherical coordinates phase - space corresponds to highly complicated proposal distributions in cartesian or / and keplerian element phase space . to increase our chances of detection of multimodal distributions",
    ", we decided to use a number of shorter markov chains instead of one long chain .",
    "we start our sampling with a set of random orbits ( i.e. , 10 sample orbits ) .",
    "each of those composes a first element in a separate markov chain .",
    "next , a new candidate orbit is proposed ( one candidate orbit for each chain ) with a help of proposal densities .",
    "that orbit is then accepted into a chain or rejected according to mh acceptance criteria :    @xmath27    where ,    @xmath28    @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the jacobians from topocentric coordinates to orbital parameters for the candidate and the last accepted sample respectively . @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote a set of orbital elements , and @xmath15 is the a posteriori probability density function . in practice , this means that a trial orbit is always accepted if it produces a better fit to the full observational data set than the last accepted one in a given chain .",
    "the trial orbit is sometimes accepted if the fit is worse than the last accepted solution . if we have a choice between jumping to bad fit and a very bad fit , the bad fit jump is more probable .",
    "if a candidate orbit is rejected , then the last accepted solution is repeated in a chain . for more details on mcmc ranging",
    "please see @xcite . to avoid manual tuning of the proposal density covariance",
    ", we have implemented an automated version of the mcmc algorithm . in the automated version ,",
    "we first run pre - runs ( which could be considered as a burn - in period ) to the actual sampling , in order to find adequate proposal density . that proposal density is computed based on empirical samples from the pre - runs , and then updated in a manner similar to that described in @xcite :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the empirical @xmath35 covariance matrix obtained from pre - run @xmath36 from @xmath37 samples @xmath38 ; @xmath39 is a scaling factor , that depends on the number of dimensions @xmath40 in the problem , in our case @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "this scaling factor is optimized for for mh in the case of gaussian targets and gaussian proposals ( for more details , please see gelman et al .",
    "1996 @xcite ) .",
    "we stop updating the proposal covariance matrix after the pre - runs in order to avoid introducing biases in the sampling and to preserve the desired properties of markov chains .",
    "the number of pre - runs depends on , for example , convergence diagnostic checks .",
    "the minimum number of pre - runs is two .",
    "the first proposal covariance matrix has to be user defined .",
    "then , we start the automated mcmc ranging with the first pre - run and require 500 sample orbits . from that first pre - run ,",
    "we compute the new proposal covariance matrix and continue with a second pre - run ( 1000 required orbits ) .",
    "a third pre - run is possible if the final number of required orbits is 50000 or more .",
    "after those pre - runs , we continue with iterative runs until all of the below conditions are fulfilled :    * the algorithm has decided that it has reached the stationary distribution ( please see the next section for more details ) , * the jump ratio in the last run is between 15 - 50% ( recommended mcmc ratio ) , * the difference in the obtained maximum likelihood p.d.f in subsequent runs is smaller than a threshold value ( @xmath43 ) . *",
    "the difference in the obtained empirical covariance matrix in sub - sequentive runs is smaller than a threshold value ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "and @xmath26 computed using a two - body model with six observations , 0.3-arcsec astrometric noise assumption , and jeffreys a priori . ]        . ]    . ]    even though the conditions are designed to ensure that we have reached the stationary distribution , one should always remember that convergence might still not have been reached ( see the next section ) . if those conditions were not fulfilled and the number of iterations exceeded the maximum number of iterations ( here we use five iterations after the pre - runs ) , the program exits with a warning that the stationary distribution has not been reached .",
    "example results of a converged run are shown in fig .",
    "[ orbel ] .      after obtaining sets of possible orbit solutions for each chain , we perform convergence diagnostics , which is a critical part of mcmc algorithms .",
    "convergence diagnostics relate to the idea that a markov chain , after a sufficient number of iterations , will eventually converge to the stationary distribution ( target distribution ) , starting from any point in the phase space and then mixing in that part of phase space forever .",
    "the proof of convergence can be found for example in roberts and rosenthal 2004 @xcite .",
    "the main concerns are : ( 1 ) convergence to the stationary distribution ; ( 2 ) the length of the burn - in period ( for example , see fig .",
    "[ burnin ] ) ; and , finally , ( 3 ) number of iterations it will take to summarize the posterior distribution @xcite .     and @xmath45 , computed for asteroid 2008 tc@xmath0 using five observations and 0.5-arcsec astrometric noise assumption .",
    "the arrow indicates the burn - in samples , before reaching the stationary distribution . ]    in general , there are two approaches to monitoring the convergence : monitoring of one chain for a long time or monitoring many chains for shorter periods of time . at present , a set of convergence diagnostics methods is available for mcmc algorithms for both of these approaches .",
    "the main idea usually involves running the markov chain repeatedly from different initial states and checking if the chains all converge to approximately the same distribution or , in the case of a single chain , running it for long time and checking if it `` looks stable '' .",
    "the diagnostics help identify problems with convergence , but can not prove that the convergence has occurred .    , assuming 1.5-arcsec astrometric noise and including four observations for a time interval of 0.003 day .",
    "]    the basic convergence testing methods include history plots ( plot of sampled parameters against the number of iterations , also called trace plots ) and marginal distribution plots .",
    "if the algorithm converged to a stable distribution , the history plot will move around the mode of the distribution , and all the chains will cover the similar parameter range . trending in trace plots",
    "can indicate lack of convergence .",
    "figure [ history ] shows an example trace plot .",
    "if the separate chains converged to different areas in the phase space , we may be able also to see `` lumpy '' posterior marginal distributions , with distinct solution clouds .",
    "this effect can be sometimes also seen in the observed - minus - computed ( o - c ) residuals plots . to test the randomness of a data set , autocorrelation function plots ( correlograms )",
    "are often used .",
    "correlograms involve computing the correlation between data sets from a single chain and separated by some lag .",
    "if random , all the correlations will be near zero .",
    "rubin @xcite proposed a statistical indicator , a so - called `` shrink factor '' r , involving the average within - chain variances , and the variance between the means obtained from @xmath46 parallel over - dispersed chains .",
    "once convergence is reached , the between chains and within chains variance should be almost equivalent because variation within the chains and variations between the chains should coincide , so r should approximately equal one .",
    "rafery and lewis @xcite proposed a method for estimating the total numbers of iterations needed , the length of the burn - in period based on chosen quantile , required accuracy , required probability to obtain specified accuracy and convergence tolerance .",
    "gewke @xcite indicated the use of methods from spectral analysis in testing for convergence .",
    "the method is graphical and based on running means of parameters and can be used in , for example , checking for the length of the burn - in period .",
    "zellner and min @xcite proposed a criterion based on conditional probability to test for convergence to a correct distribution .",
    "extensive review of mcmc convergence diagnostics methods can be found in for example mengersen et al .",
    "1999 and cowles and carlin 1996 @xcite .",
    "topic of biases induced in the mcmc diagnostics is considered in for example clowes et al .",
    "1999 @xcite . in our analysis",
    ", we make use of trace plots , kernel plots , o - c residuals plots , and gelman  rubin diagnostics .",
    "to assess the impact probabilities , we use techniques that rely on the orbital - element probability density function ( p.d.f . ) characterized using mcmc orbital ranging @xcite and mc ranging @xcite . after obtaining a set of possible orbit solutions ( here",
    "we use @xmath47 different mcmc orbits for all the objects or / and @xmath47 mc orbits ) , we propagate each of the orbits into the future to check for a possible collision with the earth within the determined impact interval @xmath48 ( time interval when collisions are possible ) .",
    "we step through this interval depending on the approximated time needed for the object to hit the earth , given as it would be heading straightforward to the earth .",
    "the next propagation step is therefore fixed as the time interval needed for the object to reach the earth , given it would be heading head - on with our planet and depending on the current velocity and distance .",
    "the collision probability is given by @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the radius of the planetary body and @xmath51 is defined as : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the minimum distance of the small body from the center of the large ( planetary ) body , @xmath54 is dirac s function , @xmath9 denotes orbital elements , @xmath15 is the a posteriori p.d.f . of the orbital elements leading to a collision . for more details ,",

    "6 - 8 , 2008 . in the case of mc results ,",
    "the orbits are weighted with the a posteriori p.d.f . ; in the case of mcmc results , the weight of an orbit equals the number of repetitions of the orbit .",
    "to study the evolution of collision probabilities for the asteroid 2008 tc@xmath0 based on a short observation arc , we use a limited number of observations from the discovery night only . here",
    "we use the first six observations obtained on october 6 , 2008 .",
    "we divide this observational data into separate small sets .",

    "we have computed and examined collision probabilities using the mc and mcmc ranging methods for the earth - impactor asteroid 2008 tc@xmath0 using small amounts of data .",
    "we have considered sampling of the astrometric uncertainty as an additional parameter to the orbital elements , which can be important for cases where that uncertainty is not known or can not be assumed .",
    "we indicate the need for more reliable methods of collision probability estimation ( less sensitive to the noise assumption ) for poorly observed objects .",
