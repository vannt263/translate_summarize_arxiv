    "numerical relativity has made significant advances in simulations which will be helpful toward achieving the final goal of providing useful information for the detection of gravitational waves , although the goal of achieving long term simulations of binary black holes has not yet been met . at some level ,",
    "we have entered an era in which einstein s equations can effectively be considered solved at the local level ; i.e. there are several codes which provide accurate evolutions in a sufficiently small space - time region where the gravitational field has small variation when expressed in a riemann normal coordinate system . however , at the global level , the computation of gravitational radiation from black hole space - times remains a highly challenging problem , in which there are vastly different time scales at play in the inner and outer regions and in which the proper choice of gauge is far from obvious .",
    "most work in numerical relativity is based upon the cauchy @xmath1 formalism ( see , for instance @xcite ) .",
    "a different approach , which is specifically tailored to study radiation , is based upon the characteristic initial value problem .",
    "this approach , which has been successful in computing gravitational radiation in single black hole space - times , is the focus of attention in this paper .",

    "besides these main equations , there is a set of constraint equations which are satisfied via the bianchi identities if they are satisfied on an inner boundary . at null infinity",
    ", these constraints can be interpreted as conservation conditions governing energy and angular momentum .",
    "the numerical implementation of the characteristic method consists in evolving a given field ( e.g. scalar , electromagnetic or gravitational ) on a family of null hypersurfaces along a discrete sequence of retarded time steps .",
    "a stable , second order accurate , fully nonlinear , 3-dimensional code ( the pitt code ) has been based upon this characteristic formalism .",
    "its implementation , tests and results have been presented in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "the code poses data on an initial null hypersurface and on an inner worldtube boundary , and evolves the exterior space - time out to a compactified version of null infinity .",

    "the @xmath11calculus simplifies the underlying equations , avoids spurious coordinate singularities and allows accurate differentiation of tensor fields on the sphere in a computationally efficient and clean way .",
    "the approach leads to a straightforward implementation of a second order convergent , finite difference code .",
    "the pitt code has undergone recent improvements to increase the accuracy in the simulation of highly distorted single black hole space - times @xcite and in the calculation of the bondi news function which describes the radiated waveform at null infinity @xmath12  @xcite .",

    "our work here is motivated by the possibility of using characteristic evolution to model bosonic stars in orbit about a black hole . besides the possible importance of such stars astrophysical and cosmological aspects  @xcite",
    ", their existence as solitonic solutions  @xcite offers a way to model a compact object without the difficulties of a hydrodynamic description of the matter field .",
    "the bosonic field can be evolved using the same characteristic techniques developed for the gravitational field . with this goal in mind , here we incorporate a scalar field in the pitt code .",

    "the spherical harmonic modes of the gravitational waves are mixed by quadratic ( and higher order ) interactions . in the case of the massless ekg system ,",
    "the scalar wave modes are only mixed indirectly through their quadratic coupling ( via their stress energy tensor ) to the gravitational field . as a result ,",
    "scalar wave modes excite gravitational wave modes at the quadratic order but they excite other scalar modes only at a cubic order . thus the scalar - scalar interaction is weaker and less interesting physically than the scalar - gravitational interaction .",
    "the production of gravitational waves by the scattering of scalar waves has many mathematical features in common with the production of gravitational waves by the motion of fluid bodies .",

    "toroidal distributions of matter fields around black holes play a major role in models describing active galactic nuclei , quasars and even gravitational wave sources .",
    "a successful simulation of these systems will require , at the very least , robust general relativistic codes appropriately coupled to relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "a toroidal scalar field distribution around a black hole represents a intermediate step for assessing the performance of the implementation . although this has limitations , it does provide a geometrical set up similar to the one expected in real astrophysical sources .",
    "therefore , it can shed light on issues such as the gravitational wave output of physical systems , the characteristics of the expected waveforms , the radiated angular momentum , etc .",
    "additionally , the equivalence of a massless scalar field to an irrotational stiff fluid provides a simple computational alternative to general relativistic hydrodynamics  @xcite , which can be used to probe the interaction of the torus with the black hole .",
    "preliminary relativistic hydrodynamical simulations already reveal that this system gives rise to rich scenarios  @xcite .",
    "* stability of kerr black holes under massive scalar fields .",
    "although the stability question of schwarzschild black holes has been settled  @xcite , the problem for spinning black holes is still quite open .",
    "in particular , it has been pointed out that for massive scalar fields , unstable modes are likely  @xcite .",
    "a mathematical analysis of such a system is complicated even in the axisymmetric case  @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of massive scalar perturbations might help shed light on this problem .",
    "* boson star orbiting a black hole  @xcite .",
    "such a simulation would shed light on both the orbital decay and the waveform radiated to null infinity .",
    "while this is perhaps the physically most interesting project , it is also the most computationally demanding because of the necessity to resolve the compact distribution of the scalar field .",
    "some of the above projects can already be studied with the code as implemented in this work .",
    "however , for more `` realistic '' scenarios one would like to extend this treatment to include massive scalar fields and spinning black holes .",
    "work in these directions is in progress .",
    "we thank m. choptuik , j. pullin and y. zlochower for their input . for correspondence on the quasinormal frequencies of scalar radiation",
    "we also wish to thank h. beyer , l. burko , k. kokkotas and r. price ; price also directed us to reference  @xcite .",
