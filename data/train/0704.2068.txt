    "the investigation of star - formation feedback on the interstellar medium ( ism ) in low - metallicity environments is of prime importance to understand and constrain the evolution of primordial systems .",
    "the most relevant diagnostics are drawn from the study of the various ism components as a function of the physical conditions in starburst - dominated objects such as dwarf star - forming galaxies and giant h  ii  regions . in this perspective , the mid - infared ( mir ) domain , which gives access to both gas and dust components , provides one of the most powerful tools .",
    "star - forming objects are characterized by strong mir emission features attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) in the photodissociation envelopes surrounding massive star clusters ( lger & puget 1984 ; allamandola et al .",
    "1985 , 1989 ; puget & lger 1989 ; tielens et al .",
    "the pahs emitting in the @xmath2-@xmath3@xmath1 m range contain from several tens up to several hundreds carbon atoms ( see , e.g. , schutte et al .",
    "pah molecules are mainly excited by far - uv radiation .",
    "the mir emission features are due to the subsequent fluorescence of aromatic c@xmath4c ( especially dominant at 6.2 and 7.7@xmath1 m ) and peripheral c@xmath4h ( 3.3 , 8.6 , and 11.3@xmath1 m ) fundamental vibrational and bending modes .",
    "the various pah emission features are differently affected by the local physical conditions such as the hardness of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , the dust temperature , or the pah mixture ( hony et al .",
    "2001 ; peeters et al .",
    "it has been suggested that strong uv radiation is able to ionize the pahs , while for weaker radiation , pahs can be neutral or even negatively charged by accretion of a single electron ( bakes & tielens 1994 , 1998 ; salama et al .  1996 ; dartois & dhendecourt 1997 ) .",
    "laboratory experiments indicate that neutral pahs show stronger c@xmath4h mode emission relatively to c@xmath4c modes while the inverse is true for ionized pahs ( szczepanski & vala 1993 ; langhoff 1996 ; kim et al .  2001 ; hudgins & allamandolla 1999 ) . as a result ,",
    "the emission features at 3.3 and 11.3@xmath1 m are thought to mainly originate from neutral pahs while the emission features between 6 and 9@xmath1 m are due to ionized pahs .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated that not only the uv radiation but also the metallicity and the dust extinction are able to significantly influence the pah ionization fraction ( cox  &  spaans 2006 ) .",
    "because of their chemical composition , pah molecules are expected to be less abundant in low - metallicity environments . the pah intensity in galaxies has been found to correlate with the ism metallicity ( see e.g. , madden et al .",
    "2006 ; engelbracht et al .",
    "2005 ; wu et al .",
    "this correlation can be due either to the low carbon abundance , to the harder isrf from low - metallicity hot stellar atmospheres ( see e.g. , schaller et al .",
    "1992 ; schaerer & maeder 1992;schaerer et al .",
    "1993 ; charbonnel et al .",

    "madden et al .",
    "( 2006 ) showed that the radiation field itself has an impact on the pah survival in various metallicity dwarf galaxies .",
    "the pah spectrum is seen to vary not only from one object to another but also within a single object .",
    "hence it is possible to investigate the variations of the pah spectrum as a function of the physical conditions across a given region ( see e.g. , joblin et al .",
    "2000 ; vermeij et al .",
    "2002 ; bregman & temi 2005 ; kassis et al .",
    "2006 ) . in a few objects ,",
    "the pah intensity has been found to decrease when the isrf hardens ( verstraete et al.1996 ; madden et al .",

    "gives the possibility to investigate the spatial distribution of the ionized gas , the molecular hydrogen gas , the pahs , the silicate dust , and the very small grains ( vsgs ) .",
    "one of the most interesting application enabled by the _ irs _ is to understand the influence of the local physical conditions , such as the hardness of the isrf , on the molecular content .",

    "the second order ( 5.2 - 7.7@xmath1 m ) is observed through the sl2 slit ( @xmath45pc@xmath44 ) .",

    "the data were processed by the spitzer science center , using the s13.2 pipeline .",
    "we used the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) product .",
    "the background was calculated using the nominal and offset observations of position # 1 , and substracted from the other positions .",
    "spectra were extracted from the two - dimensional flat - fielded detector image using scripts within the cornell irs spectroscopy modelling analysis and reduction tool environment ( smart ; higdon et al .",
    "the two order spectra scale relatively well , and no corrections were needed .",

    "the final resolution is @xmath47@xmath1 m for sl2 and @xmath48@xmath1 m for sl1 .",
    "spatial variations can be observed within the long slits ( see figure[fig : spectral_image ] ) , with regions emitting strong forbidden lines and no pahs , and regions showing intense pah features together with relatively weak lines . to investigate these spatial variations , we extracted columns , fixed to 4 pixels wide , within the long slit on the basis that the full width at half maximum of the point spread function ( psf ) is @xmath492 pixels .",
    "mir sources above or below the slit , or on each side of the extraction window within the slit , can contribute ( because of the psf ) to the total flux in a given chosen extraction window .",
    "hence the spatial column actually extracted corresponds to a region somewhat larger than 0.24@xmath500.12pc@xmath44 @xmath4 which would be the size of the extracted spatial region if the psf width was null .",
    "for this reason , it is particularly difficult to estimate the related absolute uncertainty on the flux calibration .",
    "given the fact that our study is focused on relative spatial variations , we consider this caveat as being of little importance as far as the interpretations are concerned .",
    "comparing the fluxes of same spatial positions observed at different locations within the slit , we find relative errors ranging from @xmath517% ( position # 3 , lowest integrated flux ) to @xmath514% ( position # 7 , largest flux ) .",
    "we extracted overlapping extraction windows along the slits , shifting by one pixel between each other ( which make a total of 37 different columns , and as many data points , for a given nominal or offset observation ) .",
    "this is not an actual oversampling of the spatial psf . indeed , whatever the sampling is , one is limited by the psf convolution . the spatial profile of spectral feature emission along the slit are smoothed by the psf so that the choice of the number of extracting windows only results in different samplings of the @xmath4 same @xmath4 eventually smoothed spatial profile . finally , it must be added that variations of features in the observed ( psf convolved ) spatial profile imply in reality even larger variations .",
    "we observe several pah features and forbidden emission lines superimposed on a spectral continuum which in our case is dominated by thermal emission of dust and broad silicate emission / absorption .",
    "several windows in positions # 3 , # 4 , # 5 , and # 7 show silicate absorption around 10@xmath1 m while positions # 6 and # 8 show silicate emission in the same range ( see fig.[fig : example ] ) .",
    "note that the silicate features appear less prominent in the full slit spectra of figure[fig : fullslit ] due to the contribution of several distinct physical regions within the slit . only the position # 6 shows signs of a stellar emission continuum rising toward wavelengths shorter than @xmath08@xmath1 m ( see fig.[fig : fullslit ] ) .",

    "2001 ) . however , we find that the peak of all the pah profiles does not vary by more than one resolution element across the observations of ngc3603 ( 0.06@xmath1 m for the 5.7 and 6.2@xmath1 m features , 0.12@xmath1 m for the 8.6 and 11.3@xmath1 m features ) , the only exception being the pah feature at 7.7@xmath1 m which shows a somewhat larger distribution , centered on 7.64@xmath510.24@xmath1 m .",
    "these results imply that the molecule properties do not change significantly across the region .",
    "in particular , the invariance of the 6.2@xmath1 m profile peak , centered on 6.23@xmath510.06@xmath1 m , suggests the presence of complexed and/or substituted carriers ( by introduction of an hetero atom in place of a carbon atom in the skeleton ; hudgins et al .",

    "the spectra across ngc3603 identify with the `` class @xmath98 '' in the classification of peeters et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , i.e. , where the pah features actually peak at @xmath496.22 , @xmath497.6 , and @xmath498.6@xmath1 m .",
    "this class is populated by h  ii  regions , reflection nebul  and most extragalactic sources .",
    "+     on first approximation , the pah spectra across the region look identical , with the intensities of the various features scaling together .",
    "this suggests , together with the presence of both neutral ( 11.3@xmath1 m ) and ionized ( 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6@xmath1 m ) features in the spectra , that the pah ionization fraction is relatively constant . in order to investigate in more details the influence of ionization on the pah spectra",
    ", we compare in figure[fig : pahpah1]a the intensity @xmath95(11.3 ) with @xmath95(6.2)+@xmath95(7.7)+@xmath95(8.6 ) .",
    "there is a tight correlation , implying that the neutral / ionized mixture does not vary significantly across the region .",
    "more particularly , the ratio is essentially constant as a function of the distance to the cluster ( fig.[fig : pahpah1]b ) .",
    "we attribute the constant ionization fraction to the electron recombination rate in the ionized region which balances the pah ionization rate .",
    "figure[fig : pahpah2]a shows that emission bands dominated by c@xmath4c modes and c@xmath4h modes correlate with each other .",
    "this correlation hold for the range of [ s  iv]/[ne  ii ] ratios probed across the region (  [ sec : isrf ] ) .",
    "there is no correlation with the distance to the cluster ( fig.[fig : pahpah2]b ) .",
    "these findings are consistent with the fact that the pah ionization fraction is constant across ngc3603 , since ionized pahs should show enhanced c@xmath4c mode emission ( see introduction ) .      while pah emission originates in pdrs ( tielens 1993 ; sellgren et al .",
    "1990 ) , vsg emission is seen to peak in ionized regions ( cesarsky et al .  1996 ; verstraete et al.1996 ) . in order to check",
    "whether these results hold for ngc3603 , we estimated the vsg emission by measuring the continuum flux at 14@xmath1 m .",
    "the vsg emission spans a wide range of values across the region ( fig.[fig : vsg_compa ] ) .",
    "we find that the vsg continuum intensity scales tightly with [ s  iv ] line intensity ( fig.[fig : nice ] ) .",
    "since [ s  iv ] line intensity is seen to peak close to the central cluster ( fig.[fig : sivneii_dist ] ) , we conclude that vsgs also emit mostly in these regions and that they are the dominant dust component in the ionized region .",
    "the difference between the spatial emission of pah and vsg can be seen in figure[fig : pahvsg_dist ] , where we plot the pah / vsg ratio as a function of the distance to the cluster .",
    "vsg and pah emission do not coexist spatially , the vsgs emitting mostly in the ionized region ( although they can be present elsewhere but without being excited ) .",
    "the photons exciting vsgs also illuminate pahs , thus the pah molecules may not survive the physical conditions required to heat vsgs ( madden et al .",
    "2006 ) . in order to investigate the relation between pah emission and the hardness of the isrf in more details",
    ", we use a similar approach to that of madden et al .",
    "( 2006 ) by comparing the pah emission with vsg emission .",
    "we show in figure[fig : pahnom ] the variation of the pah / vsg intensity ratio as a function of [ s  iv]/[ne  ii ] . it can be seen that pah emission becomes globally weaker when the isrf becomes harder .    the pah features dominated by c - c or c - h emission modes do not show significant differences across the region (  [ sec : pahs ] ) .",
    "thus , dehydrogenation ( rupture of the c@xmath4h bonds by absorption of uv photons ) is unlikely to be responsible for the lack of pahs relative to dust in regions where the isrf is the hardest . on the other hand ,",
    "pah molecules could be destroyed by high - energy photons .",
    "we find that [ ar  ii ] and [ ne  ii ] emission peaks always correlates with pah emission peaks .",
    "we find no regions where pah emission anticorrelates with both @xmath95([ar  ii ] ) and @xmath95([ne  ii ] ) .",
    "in contrast , some regions show an anticorrelation between pah intensity and @xmath95([ar  iii ] ) and @xmath95([s  iv ] ) ( see their identification in fig.[fig : pro3 ] and their corresponding locations in fig.[fig : slits ] ) . within these regions ,",
    "the location of the ion peak emission always follows a clear structure , being correlated with the ionization potential , and implying a sharp variation of the hardness of the isrf .",
    "we identify these transitions as being interfaces between ionized region and pdrs .",
    "the interfaces toward the ionized region regime are all located in the direction the central cluster ( fig.[fig : slits ] ) .",
    "the size of the interfaces ( between the maximal and minimal pah intensities ) is respectively 0.48 , 0.72 , 0.57 , 0.66 , and 0.40pc ( note that this should not be confused with the size of the pdr ) .",
    "the energy deposited via photon heating is potentially large enough to dissociate bonds within pahs .",
    "this has been the explanation to the pah variations in the orion bar and in the red rectangle nebula ( geballe et al .",
    "the ar  ii  ion exists for energies larger than 15.8ev and it is the dominant ionization stage in regions where pah intensity is maximal .",
    "this means that the far - uv radiation responsible for the dominant presence of ar  ii  ( from 15.8 to 27.6ev which is the ionization potential of ar  ii ) is not able to destroy efficiently the pahs , at least for the intensity of the isrf at this energy .",
    "although the energy required to break c@xmath4h or c@xmath4c bonds is 4.8ev and @xmath08.5ev respectively ( omont 1986 ) , photons with higher energy may be needed to dissociate bonds in a large molecule . using the models of omont ( 1986 ) ,",
    "we find that bonds can be broken by @xmath99ev photons only in a molecule smaller than @xmath025 - 50 c - atoms , depending on the bond type .",
    "note that the threshold size varies from one model to another , and the values we derive should only give a first order approximation .",
    "hence , one possibility is that pah molecules are large enough to prevent dissociation to occur .",
    "another possibility requires that pah molecules are small , and that the energy density is relatively weak .",
    "can we infer a maximal size for the pahs in ngc3603 ?",
    "the uv radiation required for the dominant presence of ar  iii  ( 27.6 - 40.7ev ) and s  iv  ( 34.8 - 47.3ev ) ions could be responsible for pah molecule destruction .",
    "single photons with energies 40.7ev ( 47.3ev ) are able to break bonds in molecules smaller than @xmath040 - 75 ( @xmath050 - 85 ) c - atoms , depending on the bond type .",
    "furthermore , it also implies that the energy density is large enough .",
    "although even larger pahs may be present , it is difficult to set an upper limit on their size . however , since pah emission is almost zero in regions where ar  iii  and s  iv  are dominant , it is likely that most pahs have sizes smaller than @xmath085 c - atoms , at least in regions where the isrf is the hardest .",
    "the small - scale variations of the spectral feature intensities across ngc3603 show the transition between regions dominated by pah emission and regions dominated by high - ionization lines .",
    "our results should fit in mir diagnostic diagrams used to distinguish between active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , pdr , and ionized region behaviors .    in figure[fig :",
    "laurent ] , we present a diagram , based on laurent et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and peeters et al .",
    "the templates we use are the galactic reflection nebula ngc7023 ( werner et al .",
    "2004b ; pdr excited by optical photons ) , the h  ii  region m17 - position # 2 ( peeters et al .  2004 ) , and the quasar 3c273 .",
    "accordingly to the approach of laurent et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and peeters et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we plot the continuum ratio between @xmath013.8@xmath1 m ( average flux between 13.6 and 14.0@xmath1 m ) and @xmath06.0@xmath1 m ( average between 5.9 and 6.1@xmath1 m ) against the ratio of the 6.2@xmath1 m pah intensity over the continuum level at @xmath06.0@xmath1 m .",
    "our data points form a relatively narrow stripe , probing observationally the ionized region - pdr transition ( fig.[fig : laurent ] ) .",
    "the results of positions # 7 and # 8 lie around the ionized region template , while the results of positions # 3 , # 4 , and # 5 range from 100% ionized region - contribution to 75% pdr - contribution .",
    "there is no region within our observed field in ngc3603 similar to an isolated `` exposed '' pdrs such as ngc7023 .",
    "this is likely due to a geometry effect because dust emission at 14@xmath1 m could lie in the foreground or background , resulting in an overestimation of the 14.0/6.0 continuum ratio .",
    "the only points showing more than 50% `` agn - like '' behavior are those from position # 6 that are probing the central stellar cluster .",
    "this is because for these positions , the continuum measured at 6@xmath1 m is dominated by stellar emission .",
    "thus , if a given starburst galaxy spectrum is dominated by stellar cluster emission , it could _ a priori _ be confused with an agn when using mir diagnostics",
    ". however , the global spectrum of ngc3603 , obtained using the sum of the full slit spectra of all positions ( diamond in the fig.[fig : laurent ] ) , does not show any sign of stellar contamination . in this case",
    ", the regions characterized by dust emission dominate the global spectrum .",
    "other than the small - scale results of position # 6 , none of the points probing purely ism material show signs of agn regime . using the observations in ngc3603",
    ", we successfully test this diagram as a diagnostic tool to distinguish regimes in a single objects , as long as the stellar emission is not significant .",
    "we also show in figure[fig : laurent ] the results using full slit extraction of each position ( large squares ) , that were obtained by integrating the mir emission of all the regions within the slit .",
    "the corresponding data points of each position lie in the middle of the small - scale results , implying that the full slit extraction does not give any systematic error on the diagnostic .",
    "we have investigated the spatial variations of the mir spectral feature intensities ( both ionic and solid state ) in the galactic h  ii  region complex ngc3603 , and obtained the following results :    * on first approximation , the various pah emission features have identical spatial distribution and the pah ionization fraction is constant . *",
    "the isrf hardness , as probed by the [ s  iv]/[ne  ii ] ratio , decreases as a function of the distance from the central stellar cluster .",
    "* silicate is detected in emission close to the cluster while it is detected in absorption further away .",
    "local absorption maxima of the 9.7@xmath1 m feature seem to identify with bright pah emission knots .",
    "* pah emission lies at larger distances than vsg emission and becomes weaker when the isrf becomes harder .",
    "it has been shown for low - metallicity galaxies by madden et al .",
    "it seems that pah molecules are not able to survive the same physical conditions as vsgs .",
    "the simplest explanation is the photodestruction of the molecules .",
