    "future fifth generation ( 5 g ) cellular networks , it is expected that the number of users and user demand is going to continue to increase @xcite .",
    "device - to - device ( d2d ) communications plays a key role in helping take the load off the cellular network by reducing the demand on the central network operator , i.e. , the base station ( bs ) @xcite . introducing d2d communications into the cellular network",
    "can also provide an increase in resource utilization , interference , quality - of - service ( qos ) , quality - of - experience ( qoe ) , energy efficiency , spectral efficiency , system capacity , and communication reliability .",
    "we study d2d communications as an overlay to cellular communications in order to eliminate intra - cell interference , i.e. , the interference between cellular and d2d users @xcite , as d2d pairs are allocated orthogonal spectrum .",
    "uil is a closed loop system with feedback , which allows users to choose what their requirements are and whether they will allow their behavior to be controlled or influenced @xcite , i.e. , smart communications .      in this paper , we a dynamic stackelberg game resource allocation problem in distributed d2d communications , with d2d overlay to cellular users .",
    "bs is the stackelberg leader , determines a price to charge the followers satisfaction the communication cell .",
    "the d2d pairs access the same spectrum , aim to optimally select transmit power while guaranteeing qos and qoe , with respect to the satisfaction price set by the bs .",
    "hence , the following contributions are made :    * u - beas is a user - behavior - aware dynamic stackelberg repeated non - cooperative game jointly optimizes user - behavior at the application layer and transmit power at the physical ( phy ) layer , to increase overall system capacity , qos , qoe , and while reducing transmit power for all players , as well as guaranteeing social welfare across all d2d users .",
    "* we d2d user - behavior to three : .",
    "each behavior is assigned a different utility function which suits the particular behavior and resource requirements . *",
    "the performance metric , packet delivery ratio ( pdr ) , is used to measure communication priority and reliability for each d2d pair .",
    "we show the effects of priority on by setting different minimum pdr targets for each , e.g. , has a minimum target pdr of 0.90 , has a minimum target pdr of 0.94 , and has a minimum target pdr of 0.98 . *",
    "we show that our proposed game overall has a stackelberg equilibrium , and it is a sub - game perfect equilibrium at each stage in the game , which is independent of the game history .",
    "the leader s satisfaction first rapidly converges to an optimal outcome , then the followers rapidly converge to a pareto - efficient transmit power and pdr outcome .",
    "the optimal outcome for the leader in terms of satisfaction helps guarantee social welfare across all d2d users .",
    "d2d communications can be implemented in licensed or unlicensed spectrum .",
    "we study d2d communications in licensed spectrum ( in - band ) , which is the cellular spectrum @xcite .",
    "depending on how d2d and cellular users share the spectrum , d2d communications introduce two - types of interference within the network : inter - cell interference and intra - cell interference .",
    "inter - cell interference is the interference generated between d2d and cellular users from other cells @xcite .",
    "non - cooperative power control games minimize transmit power and interference , while guaranteeing qos for all users , as in the following @xcite . in @xcite , a non - cooperative cross - layer repeated game",
    "is proposed , which combines a non - cooperative power control game and a two armed - bandit game .",
    "this work aims at minimizing transmit power and interference , while guaranteeing qos and selecting optimal transmission mode for all d2d users .",
    "stackelberg games the aforementioned works considered interference management schemes , power control , and resource utilization , however none of the works considered joint optimization between d2d user - behaviour and resource utilization , using non - cooperative game theory .",
    "d2d communications allows the offloading of traffic from the bs , which provides the following advantages to the network : ( i ) the bs can accommodate more users within the cell and increase system capacity and throughput @xcite ; ( ii ) increasing spectral efficiency of the network @xcite ; ( iii ) reduced latency for both cellular and d2d users @xcite ; ( iv ) reducing the required power consumption of the bs , cellular users , and d2d users @xcite . as a result",
    ", the bs will have more resources to allocate to determining the cell layout , user locations within the cell , priority , and type of communications .",
    "the bs can also measure each d2d user s satisfaction within the cell , in order to satisfy cell requirements . @xcite .",
    "@xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a user satisfaction based resource allocation algorithm for d2d communications was established , using an artificial fish swarm approach .",
    "the proposed approach provides improved average system satisfaction and increased system throughput , as the number of d2d pairs is increased .",
    "hence , the bs can determine the social welfare of the cell by summing all the d2d users satisfaction @xcite , where social welfare is a socially optimal outcome for particular network users - of - interest @xcite .",
    "user - in - the - loop ( uil ) is approach which can be used to enable , and measure , d2d user satisfaction .",
    "uil aims to aid user s experience by reducing traffic and delay within the network . within uil users",
    "can choose their behavior requirements .",
    "chosen behavior , incentives or penalties may be charged to the user , to ensure users maintain a certain level of qoe @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the user s chosen behavior , the incentives provided to the user may consist of postponing their non - urgent message to another time when there is less traffic , or moving to a different location where there is less traffic @xcite,@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the penalties provided to the user may consist of charging the user a cost , if they did not wish to postpone their message or move to a different location @xcite,@xcite . considering user - behavior within the network ,",
    "overall network spectral efficiency can be increased , along with qoe for each user @xcite . jointly optimizing user behavior and",
    "resource utilization is an important research problem that needs to be addressed for d2d communications , as outlined in @xcite .",
    "such joint optimization , as outlined in this paper , can lead to significantly improved user experience and require less user input , while optimizing communication parameters that increase network efficiency .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we outline the system model of our proposed game . in section",
    "we define dynamic stackelberg repeated game ( u - beas ) , utility function , . the simulation in section . finally , concluding remarks are made in section .",
    "we implement our proposed game in a single cell for a future fifth generation ( 5 g ) cellular network , where d2d communications overlay the cellular network .",
    "future 5 g cellular networks will supersede long term evolution - advanced ( lte - a ) cellular networks where some forms of d2d communications can already be deployed .",
    "within the cell there exists one base station ( bs ) , one channel , one cellular user , and @xmath0 d2d , \\{@xmath1,@xmath2,  ,@xmath3 } , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : systemmodel ] .",
    "this simplified scenario can be applied to a more general case with many cellular and d2d users . for two d2d users to communicate directly to one another",
    ", both users must be within the maximum transmission range , creating a d2d transmitter - receiver pair .",
    "depending on spectrum allocation by the bs , interference between d2d pairs may be large .",
    "the interference received at a d2d receiver , is the sum of the non - paired d2d transmitters sharing the same subchannel . .",
    "to we place a threshold on _ signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio _ ( sinr ) , to .",
    "the sinr at the receiver for the @xmath4-th d2d using part of the @xmath5-th subchannel at time slot @xmath6 is given by , @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is transmit power of the @xmath4-th d2d in subchannel @xmath5 at time @xmath6 ; @xmath10 is the interfering transmit power of the @xmath11-th d2d , who is sharing the same subchannel as the @xmath4-th d2d user ; @xmath12 is the channel gain d2d pair ; @xmath13 is the interfering channel gain between the @xmath4-th d2d pair receiver and @xmath11-th d2d transmitter , in the same subchannel ; @xmath14 is the power for d2d users ; and @xmath15 is the target sinr for d2d users .",
    "the channel model is based on free space path loss and small - scale fading ( i.e. , rayleigh fading ) , as follows , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the free space path loss channel attenuation ; @xmath18 is the small - scale fading ( i.e. , rayleigh fading ) channel attenuation , calculated using jakes model ; @xmath19 is the reference distance between ; @xmath20 is the distance between the @xmath4-th transmitter and the @xmath11-th receiver ; @xmath21 is the path loss exponent .",
    "the performance metric we to measure our proposed game is _ packet delivery ratio _ ( pdr ) .",
    "pdr is a compressed exponential function of inverse sinr @xcite , as follows , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the sinr of the @xmath4-th d2d user ; @xmath24 and",
    "@xmath25 are constants which depend on packet size , type of modulation , and coding scheme . we can rearrange into a simpler form as follows , @xmath26 @xmath27    . .",

    "[ fig : result3 ] , plots average pdr for the three behavior for all followers in the game , without considering communication priority . table [ tab : pdrresults ] outlines the average outcome of pdr for the npc games .",
    "we observe that the u - beas game has different effects on pdr , depending on the behavior class .",
    "hence , fig .",
    "[ fig : result4 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : result5 ] plot average transmit power and pdr for d2d pairs respectively , by taking into account different levels of priority for each behavior .",
    "[ fig : result4 ] exhibits the same characteristics as in fig .",
    "[ fig : result2 ] , and table [ tab : txresults ] outlines the average outcome of transmit power for the three behaviour classes with priority , for both the u - beas game and the three npc games .",
    "[ fig : result5 ] on the other hand shows the effects of pdr when different levels of priority are considered for each behavior class .",
    "table [ tab : pdrresults ] outlines the average outcome of pdr for the u - beas game and the three npc games with priority .",
    "here we see that when prioritized behavior classes are considered , average pdr is slightly improved for both the u - beas game and the npc games . in fig .",
    "[ fig : result5 ] , the serious - behavior class for the game achieves its minimum target pdr of 0.98 , except this is not the case for the serious - behavior npc game . for the other behavior classes , the u - beas game and",
    "the npc games also achieve their minimum target pdrs .",
    "the leader becomes more satisfied the game and converges to its optimal satisfaction outcome , where the d2d pairs also further reduce their transmit power to a pareto - efficient outcome , as in both fig .",

    "[ fig : result5 ] .",
    "therefore , once the leader converges to optimal satisfaction , the social welfare is guaranteed across all d2d users .",
    "in this paper , we proposed provides an optimal trade - off between minimizing transmit power and maximizing pdr , with respect to d2d user - behavior for all d2d pairs .",
    "the bs the leader , whose strategy was to measure satisfaction the cell and the d2d users .",
    "the d2d users were the followers , whose strategy was to minimize transmit power and maintain acceptable pdr , with respect to d2d user - behavior .",
    "analysis of u - beas a unique nash equilibrium , thus resulting in a stackelberg equilibrium , which is sub - game perfect ( i.e. , independent of game history ) .",
    "simulation results illustrate that as the bs converges to an optimal satisfaction ( total satisfaction ) , the followers then converge to pareto - efficient transmit power and pdr .",
    "we compared u - beas to three different npc games reflect the three different behaviors . from simulation results ,",
    "it is evident that u - beas has a much better outcome than traditional npc games , as players transmit power is further minimized , and pdr is further maximized , with respect to d2d user - behavior for all d2d pairs .",
