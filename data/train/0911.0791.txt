    "figures [ fig : color1 ] , [ fig : color2 ] and  [ fig : color3 ] show that even though the model colours fall within the range of the observed colours , there are some clusters whose colours are difficult to understand in terms of ssp models .",
    "the bluer colours of young clusters can be explained by statistical fluctuations in the number of blue supergiants contained in these clusters .",
    "however , clusters with ages in the range from 0.1 to 1 gyr are all bluer than standard ssp models predict .",
    "the model colours shown in figures [ fig : color2 ] and [ fig : color3 ] are sensitive to the contribution of tp  agb stars to the integrated ssp spectrum . bruzual ( 2007 ) showed that tp ",
    "agb stars dominate the @xmath21-band luminosity in ssps at an age of @xmath22 1 gyr , and that models computed following the prescription by marigo & girardi ( 2007 ) have brighter @xmath21-band magnitudes and redder near - infrared colours than other models .",
    "figures [ fig : color2 ] and [ fig : color3 ] suggest that either the contribution of tp  agb stars predicted by marigo & girardi ( 2007 ) is too large , producing model colors which are too red , or the spectra assigned to these stars in the models are not realistic enough .",
    "this can be understood easily by examining the contribution of various stellar evolutionary phases to the total light of the galaxy in ssp models .",
    "figure  [ fig : fract1 ] shows the fraction of light contributed by stars at different evolutionary phases as a function of time in the @xmath23 and @xmath21 bands for the @xmath16 cb09 model . in the @xmath23 band ,",
    "the tp  agb stars never contribute more than a few percent , but in the @xmath21 band their contribution reaches close to 6070% in the cb09 model , about a factor of two higher than the 40% predicted by bc03 .",
    "population synthesis models are frequently used to estimate properties of stellar populations , such as the age and mass of the stars dominating the emitted light .",
    "the preceding discussion shows that mass estimates of star clusters and galaxies with dominant stellar populations in the age range around 1 gyr depend critically on the treatment of tp  agb stars in population synthesis models .",
    "masses derived from the cb09 models are about half the masses implied by the bc03 models .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the colours of the clusters in figures [ fig : color2 ] and [ fig : color3 ] is that they are not genuine ssps , i.e. , we can not use equation  ( [ convol ] ) to find @xmath5 such that the model colours match the observations at the appropriate age and metallicity . at this point",
    ", it is difficult to decide in favour or against either one of these possibilities .",
    "it is likely that as more and better data pertaining to the frequency of tp  agb stars in resolved stellar populations become available , treatment of these stars in stellar evolution theory and population synthesis models will improve .",
    "thus , the current lack of agreement between model predictions and observations of cluster colours and magnitudes may be pointing us towards problems in the modelling , and do not necessarily imply that star clusters do not behave like ssps .     and @xmath20 colour evolution for several @xmath24 ssp models : cb09 ( thick black solid line ) , marigo _ et al . _",

    "this is a good approximation for large stellar ensembles , such as massive galaxies but , depending on mass , it may not be appropriate to describe less numerous populations , like star clusters or dwarf galaxies .      to describe low - mass populations , we must construct models that allow discrete sampling of the stellar imf .",

    "as these authors indicated , removing this feature from the analytical imf models poses a theoretical difficulty , as it would also prevent the significant enrichment of helium and nitrogen in the most massive agb stars , which is required to explain the observed abundances in type i planetary nebulae .",
    "conroy _ et al . _",
    "( 2009_a , b _ ) explored in detail the impact of key phases of stellar evolution , imf variations and sampling , and other parameters on the derived properties of stellar populations using population synthesis models .",
    "the reader is referred to these papers for enlightening discussions .",
    "( 2009_a _ ) show that artificially increasing the effective temperature of tp  agb stars by @xmath74 or decreasing their bolometric luminosity by @xmath75 makes the predicted @xmath15 colour bluer by 1 and 0.5 mag , respectively .",
    "the bluer colours observed in the data compared to the analytical imf model predictions in figures [ fig : color2 ] , [ fig : color3 ] and [ fig : simul2 ] can also be understood if we assume that clusters are not ssps , and instead allow for the presence of composite stellar populations in these clusters .",
    "figures [ fig : simul2]_(b ) _ and [ fig : simul2]_(d ) _ show the bluing in the colours produced by a second burst of star formation amounting to 30% of the initial cluster mass occurring at different ages throughout the cluster s history . as indicated by the thin vertical lines ,",
    "the colours become bluer than in the ssp model and remain blue for a short period of time . successive bursts of star formation will maintain the bluer colours for a prolonged period of time .",
    "the dashed lines in figures [ fig : simul2]_(b ) _ and [ fig : simul2]_(d ) _ show the colours of models undergoing continuous star formation . the star - formation rate is assumed to decay exponentially in time , as indicated in the figure caption . in this case",
    ", the models do not become as blue as in the multiple - burst scenario .",
    "stochastic fluctuations in the number of stars populating the imf thus provide a natural explanation for the lmc cluster colours in the age range from @xmath72 to a few @xmath73 yr .",
    "in our simulations , the colours of the reddest _ younger _ clusters require supersolar metallicities , which may not be realistic for the lmc . at older ages",
    ", there is no problem reproducing the colours of the oldest lmc clusters , which have ages and metallicities typical of galactic old globular clusters .    in a series of papers ,",
    "cervio _ et al .",
    "_ ( 2000 , 2001 , 2002 ) examined the effects of the stochastic nature of the imf in star clusters from a different perspective .",
    "they parameterized the distributions of the observed parameters in clusters of the same mass and age in terms of confidence limits in population synthesis models .",
    "these confidence limits can be understood as the inherent uncertainties in the synthesis models due to the fact that models use continuous functions that do not reproduce exactly the discontinuous nature of star formation , especially in systems containing small numbers of stars .",
    "this approach provides the theoretical basis for our monte carlo simulations , and reaches similar conclusions to ours .",
    "the amplitude of the stochastic fluctuations depends critically on the number of stars present in the stellar population , i.e. , on the cluster mass . for a given cluster mass ,",
    "the fluctuations are smaller in colours determined by stars in evolutionary phases populated by large numbers of stars , e.g. , the @xmath13 and @xmath14 colours in figure [ fig : simul2 ] , which are dominated by ms stars .",
    "the fluctuations increase in those colours dominated by bright and short - lived stellar phases , e.g. , the near - infrared colours dominated by tp ",
    "agb stars .",
    "the predictions of the standard population models should reproduce the behaviour of stellar populations with mass @xmath76 m@xmath3 .",
    "stochastic fluctuations certainly dominate the predicted colours and magnitudes for clusters of mass @xmath77 m@xmath3 .",
    "the magnitudes and colours predicted by stellar population synthesis models do not readily match observations of unresolved star clusters , which are commonly expected to behave like ideal ssps .",
    "this lack of agreement between the model predictions and observations may indicate problems or deficiencies in the modelling , and does not necessarily tell us that star clusters do not behave like ssps .    in this review ,",
    "i have briefly summarized the results of simple simulations which show how the range of colours observed in intermediate - age lmc star clusters can be understood on the basis of current stellar evolution theory , if we properly take into account the expected variation in the number of stars occupying sparsely populated evolutionary stages , due to stochastic fluctuations in the imf . in this case ,",
    "population synthesis models reproduce remarkably well the full ranges of observed integrated colours and absolute magnitudes of star clusters of various ages and metallicities .",
    "some young clusters are described by supersolar - metallicity models , which may not be realistic for the lmc .",
    "there is no need to introduce ad hoc assumptions into population synthesis models ( maraston 1998 ; maraston _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) , representing a departure from our current understanding of stellar evolution theory , to explain the observed range of cluster colours and magnitudes .",
    "the predicted fluctuations in the integrated photometric properties of simulated clusters increase with decreasing cluster mass , as expected on the basis of the results of cervio _ et al . _",
    "( 2000 , 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , because of the stochastic nature of the integrated - light properties of star clusters , single clusters may not be taken as reference standards of ssps of a given age and metallicity .",
    "it should be emphasized that matching the photometric properties of star clusters using ssp models is a necessary condition for clusters to be considered simple stellar populations , but not sufficient .",
    "so far , the single ms and unique ms turnoff required by ssps can be established with certainty only for resolved stellar populations .",
