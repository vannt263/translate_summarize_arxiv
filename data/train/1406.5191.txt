    "our understanding of the present - day distributions of galaxies and their properties has largely focused on the accounting of stellar mass back through time .",
    "such work is routine , with snapshots of the distribution of mass in both active and passive galaxies from @xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to @xmath5 @xcite , and galaxy mass functions back to times when the universe was under a gyr old @xcite . out of these efforts",
    "we see a striking tenfold increase in the numbers of quiescent @xmath6 galaxies since @xmath5 @xcite , with a twofold increase since just @xmath7 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "despite such evolution in the numbers of normal and massive galaxies , the processes that produced such growth remain elusive .",
    "the conundrum is compounded by the relative invariance in the shape the passive galaxy mass function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "how are so many passive galaxies created over such a broad range of stellar mass at relatively equal rates during the past 10 gyr while preserving the overall distribution of ellipticities @xcite ? and why do the quiescent and star - forming mass functions have the same slope at low masses , with a quiescent galaxy fraction of 15%-20% that stays relatively constant with time @xcite ?",
    "furthermore , the processes that make such tremendous numbers of massive galaxies quiescent over the past 10 gyr have also served to increase their apparent sizes @xcite , with some attendant morphological transformations @xcite .",
    "accounting for this size evolution has required invoking minor _ and _ dry mergers @xcite , as there are apparently too few substantial , or potentially substantial mergers @xcite to get the job done despite the well - known correlations between young stellar populations and fine structures and tidal features in early - type galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the evolving morphological mix of quiescent galaxies since @xmath8 surely indicates that both disks and bulges play crucial roles @xcite , that the processes that both grow galaxies and lead to increased quiescence are not decoupled .    snapshots of stellar mass alone , however , have not uncovered the mechanisms that gave rise to such an abundance of quiescent galaxies at late times . the distribution of ongoing star - formation rates ( sfr ) at fixed stellar mass has been taken as a crucial piece of the puzzle ; such data offer the only direct window into the key process by which galaxies grow .",
    "locally there exists a strong correlation between sfr and stellar mass , with a slope near unity and @xmath9 dex of scatter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at modest masses , @xmath10 , the slope changes , such that ssfr declines mildly with mass , and such a shape is observed back to @xmath8 @xcite .    the relative constancy of ssfr is commonly used to infer that star - formation proceeds with similar efficiency in all galaxies .",
    "after all , baryonic mass must scale roughly with halo mass , and since gas mass roughly scales with baryonic mass the constant ssfr must imply a universal efficiency with which galaxies convert gas into stars . at high masses",
    "the change in slope implies diminished efficiency , though recent work by @xcite shows that at least some of the anticorrelation between ssfr and galaxy mass arises because massive galaxies tend to have higher bulge mass fractions , on average , and bulges tend not to form stars in great numbers .",
    "the fact that bulges do not participate meaningfully in the formation of stars compared to disks means that one should decouple the processes of star - formation and bulge growth from the sfms . if one wants to probe the extent to which star - formation efficiency is a property of galaxy disks , then normalizing sfr by the total stellar mass of galaxies is unhelpful . using a large sample of galaxies in the sdss",
    ", @xcite deduced the stellar masses of galaxy disks and constructed a new sfms using sfr/@xmath11 .",
    "they found that the presence of bulge mass had accounted for @xmath12 dex / dex of the slope of the sfms at high masses . if bulge formation is a process that is distinct from the _ in situ _ stellar mass growth of galaxies , then the steeper slopes derived earlier for the high - mass end of the sfms was providing a skewed picture of the processes that quench galaxies .",
    "naturally one wants to understand both the histories of star - formation and mass assembly , as the latter process serves to increase the denominator of ssfr with potentially negligible impact on the numerator .",
    "@xcite found that there was significantly less dependence of the star - formation efficiency of galaxy disks on galaxy mass than one would have deduced by assuming galaxies were monolithic structures .    despite such trivialities as galactic structure ,",
    "the redshift dependence of the sfms had been coupled with the evolving stellar mass function to provide functional frameworks to describe the growth and quenching of galaxies over time @xcite .",
    "these physical interpretations for scaling relations such as the sfms are on one end of a spectrum of even more informative , yet deterministic , schemes for describing the growth of galaxies in cosmological contexts @xcite .    here",
    "we consider the sfms from a different standpoint , recognizing that the growth of stellar mass occurs within a tempestuous context , over long and short timescales , and a myriad of environments . as such",
    ", we attempt to treat the _ in situ _ growth of stellar mass , i.e. star - formation , as a stochastic process .",
    "stochastic processes have strict definitions in the mathematical and statistical literature that are different than what astronomers normally assume when loosely using the word `` stochastic . ''",
    "a stochastic process is not a random process , but it is defined by a formal expectation that on average they do _ not _ change from one moment to the next . under this formalism , the central limit theorem produces a correlation between sfr and stellar mass strikingly similar to the one observed .",
    "finding that the sfms is a statistical artifact may run counter to one s intuition  how can a purely mathematical derivation of a distribution of ssfrs properly reflect the range of astrophysical phenomena that grow galaxies , as well as the potentially broad range of timescales that govern stochasticity in a cosmological context ?",
    "one very specific answer calls to our intuition as astronomers : if a galaxy of a given mass and star - formation rate today probably did nt have a very different star - formation rate a short time ago , and then again a short time before that , and before that , then there s a limited set of histories that could have resulted in that galaxy having that mass at the present epoch . any significant perturbation to its star - formation history ( sfh )",
    "would have produced a galaxy with a different mass .",
    "it is this normalization of star - formation by stellar mass that is the key to seeing the sfms as a scale - free consequence of the stochastic processes that grew galaxies over time .    from this point of view , we derive a statistical description of the ensemble of star - forming galaxies using a minimum of deterministic rules . for much of the text",
    "we treat the ensemble of galaxies as an ensemble of systems that form stars .",
    "because the bulk of star - formation occurs not in bulges , we assume our formalism pertains specifically to galaxy disks , or at least the general class of star - forming disk galaxies .",
    "however , this distinction is made more out of convenience so that the methodology can be generalized to encompass other sources of stellar mass , such as merging and accretion .",
    "such processes also bring fuel for star - formation , but the resulting growth of stellar mass out of that gas is observed through measurements of _ in situ _ sfrs and as such is largely accounted for in our derivation of the sfms .",
    "such details are deferred until later , as we have not yet left the introduction .    in  [ sec :",
    "process ] stochastic processes are defined for the purposes of modeling stellar mass growth , and the central limit theorem is applied in order to derive the long - term behavior in distribution . in  [ sec : fbm ] we generalize the results to histories with long - term correlations between stochastic events . within this formalism",
    "we discuss a number of immediate consequences for the general distributions of star - forming galaxies in  [ sec : predict ] . in ",
    "[ sec : mf ] we extend the mathematical consequences of stochasticity to a general discussion of stellar mass growth over cosmic time .  [ sec : ambig ] we provide a few examples where stochasticity limits our ability to interpret observations . finally in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize the key points . all equations derived below have been verified with numerical experiments .",
    "stochastic processes are not anarchic , but remain constant _ on average _ from one timestep to the next , much like a random walk or gambling on a coin toss . an analogy : go measure star - formation rates for a sample of galaxies . what will their sfrs be in the near future ?",
    "though the sfrs of individual galaxies may have experienced small changes , on average things will not look very different .",
    "so let us consider a process , @xmath13 , as the amount of stellar mass formed over time interval @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mass accumulated up to the interval @xmath14 in time @xmath17 by _ in situ _ mass growth .",
    "we will assume discrete timesteps for the moment , with no loss of generality .",
    "if @xmath18 is a stochastic process , then at time @xmath19 there is an expectation that @xmath20 is , on average , the same as @xmath18 : @xmath21=s_t\\label{eq : stationary}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in other words , 10 years from now we expect the milky way to be forming stars at the same rate that it does today , and the same should be true 100 years from now , and 10 million years from now , or even 100 million years from now . but over time there are probabilities that the star - formation rate may go up a little or go down a little .",
    "so from one timestep to the next there are changes to @xmath13 , which we define as @xmath22 : @xmath23 at this point in the derivation the astronomer should note that physics is buried here , in @xmath22 , where a broad range of astrophysical processes can serve to increase or decrease @xmath13 , the rate at which a galaxy grows .",
    "these `` stochastic differences '' in @xmath13 are independent random numbers drawn from distributions centered on zero , because that is the definition of a stochastic process , and because there are astrophysical reasons why the rates of growth for galaxies may increase or decrease",
    ". we will revisit this assumption later as we generalize the derivations for correlations among the stochastic differences , and for a more general picture of galaxy assembly .",
    "for now we assume these stochastic differences are all independent , so that at each timestep , the random variables @xmath22 are also be drawn from distributions with potentially time - dependent variances : @xmath24=\\sigma^2_{t+1}\\label{eq : variance}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we can rewrite the stellar mass formed at time @xmath14 as the sum of the stochastic differences : @xmath25 where we set @xmath26 for simplicity .    by definition the accumulated stellar mass growth at time",
    "@xmath27 is @xmath28    note that the sfms is an observed correlation of @xmath29 vs @xmath30 , and we have now shown that it is really between @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this recasting is important as the variances in @xmath22 will drive both @xmath13 and @xmath33 from only the very few assumptions made so far .",
    "we now proceed to derive long - term expectation values for both @xmath13 and @xmath33 , as well as an expected distribution of @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ; specific star - formation rate ) .      if the stochastic differences , @xmath36 , are independent , random variables centered on zero  with equal probability of being positive or negative",
    " @xmath13 is called a martingale , and @xmath22 are called martingale differences .",
    "martingales were originally defined in the context of gambling as `` fair '' games , where , at any time or step , @xmath13 ( your winnings ) may go up or down with equal chance , by an amount @xmath22 , _ independent of earlier events_. there exist central limit theorems that describe their long - term behavior in distribution @xcite , briefly summarized here .",
    "we introduced stellar mass growth as a stochastic process , and continue by defining the variance in @xmath29 : @xmath37&=\\label{eq : var2}&\\mathcal{e}[s_t^2]-(\\mathcal{e}[s_t])^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when the stochastic differences are independent , the variance in @xmath29 , is simply the sum of the variances in the stochastic differences leading up to that time . because @xmath13 is stationary , @xmath37\\label{eq : clt1}&=&\\sum^{t}_{t=1}x_t^2=\\sum^{t}_{t=1}\\sigma_t^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "this result appears similar to brownian motion , itself a simple stochastic process , though here we have allowed , for example , the variances to also be random , and for the distributions of stochastic differences to be non - gaussian . by doing so , we attempt a derivation with as few assumptions about stellar mass growth as possible .    given @xmath38 galaxies with their stochastic histories , we define a normalization for object @xmath39 that is equivalent to an expected rms fluctuation in @xmath40 : @xmath41^{1/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the central limit theorem states that the distribution of @xmath29 will be a gaussian centered on zero with a standard deviation of unity . in other words ,",
    "@xmath40 , where @xmath42 , converges _ in distribution _ to the normal distribution , @xmath43 @xcite , when @xmath13 is properly normalized : @xmath44    what we see already in equation [ eq : gauss1 ] is that given some astrophysical variance @xmath45 , known or measured _ a priori _ for a distribution of galaxies or proto - galaxies , we can already calculate an expected variance in stellar mass growth at any epoch @xmath46 .",
    "but before we apply such a probability distribution to star - formation , we now impose nonnegativity on @xmath18 .",
    "galaxies grow stars at nonnegative rates so our solutions for the distributions of @xmath13 must be bounded by @xmath47 .",
    "one approach is to approximate _ in situ _ stellar mass growth in a manner similar to geometric brownian motion , where one models distributions of @xmath48 , and the stochastic differences @xmath22 are changes in the logarithm of sfr",
    ". doing so would undoubtedly ensure positivity , but such an approach would preclude the possibility that ( some ) galaxies may stochastically be driven to star formation rates of zero .    by adopting a boundary condition of @xmath47 , we obtain a probability density for @xmath29 that is not a symmetric gaussian centered on zero , as shown in equation [ eq : gauss1 ] , but is simply the nonnegative side of the gaussian : @xmath49\\label{eq : pnn}&=&\\biggl({2\\over\\pi}\\biggr)^{1/2}\\int_{0}^{x}e^{-{1\\over 2}z^2}\\text{d}z\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we obtain this result because technically @xmath13 is no long a martingale but a submartingale . loosely a submartingale is defined by @xmath21\\ge s_t\\label{eq : sub}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for example , when a galaxy s star - formation rate has been stochastically driven to @xmath50 , the sfr at the next interval can not be driven to lower rate and can only go up .",
    "thus @xmath13 is no longer a `` fair game . '' with submartingales there are several tricks for deriving their limiting behavior , but in this case it simplest to use the theorem that every submartingale can be written as the absolute value of a martingale @xcite . in doing so",
    "one derives the above result ( with numerical experiments verifying this behavior ) .",
    "the expectation values for @xmath18 and @xmath16 over @xmath51 are @xmath52&\\label{eq : st}=&\\biggl({2\\over{\\pi}}\\biggr)^{1/2}\\biggl({t\\over{t}}\\biggr)^{1/2}\\\\ \\mathcal{e}\\bigl[{m_t\\over t^{1/2}\\sigma}\\bigr]&\\label{eq : mt}=&{2\\over{3}}t\\biggl({2\\over{\\pi}}\\biggr)^{1/2}\\biggl({t\\over{t}}\\biggr)^{3/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the variance : @xmath53\\label{eq : clt2}&=&{1\\over{2}}\\mathcal{e}\\bigl[{s_t\\over t^{1/2}\\sigma}\\bigr]^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is just the normalization for the central limit theorem ( equation [ eq : gauss1 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath55 the expectations are , including the expectation for the standard deviation : @xmath56\\label{eq : clt4}&=&{3\\over{2t}}\\\\ \\text{sig}\\bigl[{s_t\\over m_t}\\bigr]\\label{eq : clt5}&=&{1\\over{\\sqrt{2}}}\\mathcal{e}\\bigl[{s_t\\over m_t}\\bigr]\\\\ \\text{sig}\\bigl[\\ln { s_t\\over m_t}\\bigr]&\\approx&{1\\over{\\sqrt{2}}}\\\\ \\text{sig}\\bigl[\\log { s_t\\over m_t}\\bigr]&\\approx&0.3\\hbox { dex}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] what these derivations show is that under the assumptions outlined above , we would expect ssfr to ( 1 ) be mass - independent , ( 2 ) fall like @xmath2 , and ( 3 ) have a _ relative _ dispersion that should be independent of mass and time , at a level of @xmath57 dex .",
    "we have neither made , nor required , any assumptions about the star - formation efficiencies of galaxies to reach these results .",
    "these expectation values can be directly contrasted to the case where there are zero stochastic changes to star - formation , as such a case would produce @xmath58=1/t$ ] , and @xmath59=0 $ ] .",
    "such was the case explored by the models of @xcite .",
    "random noise in the star - formation histories leads to an increase in the median ssfr by 50% , but leaves the correlation between sfr and mass in tact with fairly small scatter .    before we can directly compare these expectations to the observed sfms , as well as other data",
    ", we will generalize the derivation in  [ sec : fbm ] for expected short- and long - term correlations between the random , stochastic changes in star - formation . and before doing that",
    ", we first have two digressions : one on timescales , and another on how notions of star - formation efficiency might fit into this framework .      until now we have kept the derivations simple by adopting constant integer intervals for timesteps .",
    "the reader may wonder how our derivations may depend on the timescales over which galaxies experience stochastic changes to their stellar mass growth .",
    "equation [ eq : dmdt ] explicitly allows for arbitrary intervals in time , such that @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the mean star - formation rate during the @xmath14th interval in time .",
    "thus @xmath62 and @xmath63    while it is not strictly necessary to adopt constant intervals in time ( for a given galaxy ) , we do so below to simplify the presentation .",
    "the equations for randomly varying timesteps is a little more involved than is needed here , though we explore the consequences of random timescales later in ",
    "[ sec : time2 ] .",
    "so let us now write @xmath64 and @xmath65    the martingale differences @xmath66 are drawn from distributions with @xmath67 .",
    "after normalizing as in equation [ eq : norm ] and rearranging , we obtain @xmath68&=\\label{eq : stp}&\\sigma'\\biggl({2\\over{\\pi}}\\biggr)^{1/2}{t}^{1/2}\\\\ \\mathcal{e}[m_t]&=\\label{eq : mtp}&\\delta{\\mathcal{t}}\\sigma'{2\\over{3}}\\biggl({2\\over{\\pi}}\\biggr)^{1/2}{t}^{3/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using these results , we therefore derive an expectation value for ssfr for the ensemble of disk galaxies whose stochastic changes in sfr occur on timescales of @xmath69 : @xmath70&=\\label{eq : time2}&{3\\over{2t\\delta{\\mathcal{t}}}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and since at any given epoch @xmath71 is just the time since the beginning of star - formation , we recover the earlier result that @xmath72=3/(2\\mathcal{t})$ ] . put more concretely : galaxy disks that experience @xmath73 major stochastic changes to their stellar mass growth over a random distribution of timescales since @xmath74 will have the same distribution of ssfrs as galaxies that experience @xmath75 major episodes over the same span of cosmic time .",
    "in summary , equation [ eq : time2 ] adds another key point to the conclusions drawn earlier for the distribution of ssfrs for fair , representative samples of star - forming disk galaxies .",
    "not only is @xmath76 $ ] independent of mass , and not only does it fall by @xmath77 , and not only is its relative scatter independent of mass and time , but these expectations are independent of the timescales over which stochastic changes in star - formation occur . in other words ,",
    "_ almost _ no information is encoded within diagrams of ssfr vs stellar mass regarding the timescales of the processes that bounce galaxies up or down or left and right .",
    "star - formation rate indicators that probe a range of timescales within a given galaxy will , of course , provide useful information on formation histories , but the derivation of individual histories from the sfms is mathematically ill - defined .",
    "at least as derived so far , and we are not yet finished , the sfms appears to be as fundamental a scaling relation as one might ever find in nature , arising not from any astrophysically deterministic laws of galaxy evolution , but seemingly arising from one of the most profound mathematical ones , the central limit theorem .",
    "we have one more brief aside before generalizing our derivations for correlated stochastic changes in sfr , followed by a short discussion of observations related to these statistical expectations .",
    "in that context we will also discuss general extensions to our formalism to include _ ex situ _ stellar mass growth , and variable timescales of stochasticity .",
    "equations [ eq : stationary ] through equations [ eq : time2 ] were written assuming @xmath13 as increments of _ in situ _ stellar mass growth .",
    "however , one may write @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the fuel available for making new stellar mass at time @xmath14 and @xmath80 is the efficiency with which fuel is converted to new stars",
    ". such notation may explicitly incorporate stochastic changes in efficiency over time , as well as changes in the availability of cold gas to form new stars , but the derivation of the sfms continues unaltered .",
    "while we are not finished deriving what will be the final form of the sfms for disk galaxies , we have already concluded that the observed correlation between sfr and stellar mass for disk galaxies is independent of mass , time , or even timescales , and it is equally important to stress that the existence of the sfms does not imply that galaxies form stars with uniform , or nearly uniform efficiency .",
    "it may prove interesting in the future to employ @xmath80 and @xmath81 , if only to use observations outside of the sfms to constrain the astrophysical processes and events that drive stochastic changes in sfr .",
    "we will comment more later , but no matter the cause , so long as the stochastic differences are random and stationary , no amount of tinkering with astrophysical underpinnings will move the expectation values for star - forming disks . all astrophysics is subsumed within @xmath82 , defined by equation [ eq : norm ] .",
    "recasting @xmath13 as a combination of star - formation efficiency and fuel supply only changes the philosophical underpinnings of @xmath82 but does not prevent it from cancelling out when dividing @xmath13 by @xmath33 .",
    "the long ( infinite ) reach of gravity , plus the primordial power spectrum , correlates events over a broad range of time - scales .",
    "unfortunately the derivation in ",
    "[ sec : process ] assumed that stochastic changes in star - formation were independent and uncorrelated . when events are correlated equation [ eq : stoch ] must be modified @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes a maximum number of covariant timesteps , and @xmath85 are the unknown correlation coefficients between the stochastic changes in @xmath13 at times @xmath14 and @xmath86 .    because @xmath84 describes the correlation timescale",
    "over which changes in @xmath13 are arbitrarily covariant , these changes are referred to as `` @xmath84-dependent random variables . ''",
    "fortunately such random variables also obey central limit theorems ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , for the form of correlations expected in a cosmological context , the sums of @xmath84-dependent random variables converge _ in distribution _ to fractional brownian motions @xcite . in  [ sec : process ] our derivations converged to nonnegative brownian motions .",
    "fractional brownian motions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are `` fractional '' in the sense that the stochastic changes in @xmath13 are not fully independent of each other .",
    "thus , fbm is a generalization of the formalism derived earlier  in which we derived expectations for purely random changes in sfr  such that the random changes are smoothed on all timescales .",
    "this smoothing is controlled by @xmath87 , the hurst parameter , where @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath89 there is no covariance between the stochastic changes in @xmath13 and the derivations in  [ sec : process ] are recovered exactly .",
    "in contrast , histories with @xmath90 show rapid variability , where increases in @xmath13 tend to be followed rapidly by stochastic decreases , ever trying to revert @xmath13 to the mean . in the limit of @xmath91 ,",
    "the solutions are equivalent to constant star - formation , with @xmath92 and zero intrinsic scatter .",
    "when @xmath93 , there are long - term trends , since increases tend to be followed by more increases , and decreases tend to be followed by more decreases .",
    "the larger @xmath87 is , the more the implied histories are marked by extremes of feasts and famines , as one might expect in a universe of hierarchical galaxy and structure formation .",
    "it is remarkable and convenient that the unknown , random distributions of stochastic changes in star - formation _ and the unknown , random covariances between them over arbitrarily long timescales _ may be reduced , in distribution , to a single number : @xmath87 .",
    "normalizing by @xmath54 as above , fbm has well - behaved expectations for @xmath18 , with simple dependencies on @xmath87 @xcite . in the coming sections we will compare these long - term expectation values with a range of data but",

    "such demarcation crudely separates when each aggregate `` stellar population '' might appear red or blue .",
    "the normalized growth histories for these paths are shown in figure [ fig : sfhplot2 ] , color coded similarly .    it is important to note that the formal rules of stochastic processes have led to suites of growth histories , depending on the level at which stochastic changes to sfr are correlated over time .",
    "the central limit theorem provides probability densities for these histories such that an aggregate distribution of sfhs can be constructed _ a priori _ , based on the amount of time a galaxy had to grow to its given mass .",
    "however , nothing in the rules , so far , has limited which histories may be unphysical or potentially disallowed . in theory these are the distributions for unbiased ensembles , where sfrs have an equal chance of increasing or decreasing at every ( unknown ) timestep .",
    "astrophysical simulations may serve to constrain these sets to better represent the cosmological distribution of histories that real star - forming disks experience .",
    "we introduce generalizations to this formalism later in the text to help account for astrophysically interesting constraints , but proceed under the assumption , for now , that these general distributions of sfhs represent the range of possible histories for the universe s ensemble of galaxies as they evolve through a broad range of dynamically changing galaxy environments over cosmic time .",

    ", the distribution of sfr at fixed mass should skew high .",
    "in such regions , however , _",
    "ex situ _ stellar mass growth will also be higher . how these two processes are mismatched will determine whether , and for how long , galaxies sit high or low with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "which process wins out in shaping the observed distributions of ssfr ?",
    "how does this competition shape the star - formation - density relation @xcite ? and since high - density regions of the universe evolve more quickly than low - density regions of the universe , do these high - density regions simply contain distributions of galaxies with intrinsically longer timescales of stochasticity at fixed cosmic time ?",
    "of course these environments serve to systematically suppress @xmath13 ( or @xmath81 ) in the long - term , contributing to systematically lower ssfr at fixed mass at high density @xcite .",
    "note too that equation [ eq : time2vo ] is mathematically identical to equation [ eq : smothq ] .",
    "the result is that long - term systematic lengthening of stochastic timescales will have the same mathematical consequence on distributions of ssfr as the long - term accumulation of stellar mass from mergers and accretion , and the same mathematical consequence on distributions of ssfr as running out of fuel for star - formation .",
    "thus the repetitive diminishing of sfr per unit stellar mass in high mass galaxies may arise because something occurs to systematically lengthen the timescales over which stochastic changes in occur  separately from processes that diminish star - formation efficiency and/or fuel supply , or add stellar mass to galaxies from the outside .",
    "based on the explorations above , and the correlations shown earlier between @xmath183 ratios and galaxy colors , it appears that galaxy scaling relations , and the sfms in particular , are degenerate integrations of the processes that grow and shape galaxies over time .",
    "coupling such data with , for example , the evolution of stellar mass functions and measurements of the sfrd over time will be critical for identifying which galaxies are accreted out of the mass function as @xmath209 , the external source of stellar mass growth , and whether @xmath13 decreases with time faster than @xmath33 increases .",
    "certainly any model of the long - term evolution of galaxies must include all such processes , but at least we now have the first step or two in assembling a meaningful statistical framework .",
    "even with only the beginnings of a new framework , we can already reinterpret a broad range of observations beyond the sfms , casting , for example , the growth of galaxies through starbursts and the rise of quiescent galaxies in a new light .",
    "starbursts are galaxies that have rates of ongoing star - formation significantly higher than their lifetime - averaged sfrs ( @xmath238 ) .",
    "these are classified usually by @xmath239 , where @xmath240 is a threshold .",
    "our derivations specify a distribution of ssfr at any given time for disk galaxies , and thus relates specifically to the frequency one should expect `` starburst '' phenomena .",
    "this framework should not be interpreted in a way that implies starburst galaxies are not real , but simply that there is a natural way to calculate the probability that galaxies , at a given mass , have had a large fraction of their mass formed very recently ( especially since growing more rapidly would have put them into the next larger mass bin ) .",
    "equation [ eq : clt4h ] , and figure [ fig : pull4 ] , say that @xmath241 is equal to twice the lifetime average sfr .",
    "if one has defined a starburst as a galaxy with @xmath242 , one can use our statistical model for the distribution of sfrs at fixed mass and calculate the expected fractions of disks that exceed such thresholds .",
    "our fbm realizations have `` starburst '' fractions of 20% at @xmath243 ( half a hubble time ) , and 24% at @xmath244 ( these variations belie the effects of the finite size of our fbm samples ) .",
    "in other words @xmath245 of disk ( bulgeless ) galaxies should meet this starburst criterion at every epoch .",
    "@xcite , in fact , found @xmath246 of field galaxies at @xmath247 in such a starburst mode . at masses where bulge mass fractions are not substantial",
    ", this starburst fraction should should remain relatively constant  at least when defined relative to lifetime average sfrs . in a study of dwarf galaxies in the local volume , @xcite found starburst fractions of @xmath248 , comparable to the prediction here , though small number statistics and uncertain starburst criteria make a detailed comparison more difficult .",
    "but as bulges assemble over time , at fixed mass , this operational definition of starburst masks the presence or meaning of burstiness , which ought to be defined in relation to disk mass .",
    "recall that the fraction of disks with @xmath249 is @xmath250 .",
    "galaxies with bulge mass fractions of @xmath251 would only meet the same observational threshold if @xmath252 and only @xmath253 actually meet this heightened level of activity . those galaxies with 75% bulge",
    "mass fractions require even greater activity to be classified as starbursts , at a level of @xmath254 , and @xmath255 of disks will meet this criterion .",
    "the first consequence of these calculations is that as populations of galaxies acquire more and more stellar mass from outside sources , fewer and fewer will appear as starbursts .",
    "in fact , @xcite found that the starburst fraction decreased from 25% at @xmath247 to @xmath256 by @xmath257 , and @xmath258 today . using the typical bulge mass fractions for galaxies with @xmath259 in the sdss , @xmath260 @xcite , and correcting the starburst criteria , one derive starburst fractions of @xmath261 .",
    "these results suggest that galaxies at these modest masses have acquired substantial amounts of stellar mass from outside sources , presumably assembling it into bulges and spheroids , and the observed rapid evolution in early - type fraction at low redshift seen by @xcite in the field supports such an assertion .",
    "disks that meet starburst definitions will only do so for a specified periods of time , and these timescales will depend sensitively on the starburst intensity .",
    "after all , forming stars too quickly will push a galaxy into the next mass bin , where that galaxy s sfr will be compared to an entirely different distribution of sfrs .",
    "our mathematical framework provides estimates for these timescales .    .",
    "but for galaxies that have bulge mass fractions of 50star - formation rate @xmath262 is equivalent to @xmath263 , shown in orange .",
    "half of these galaxies would no longer be considered starbursts by @xmath264 , or about 0.5 gyr .",
    "for galaxies with bulge mass fractions of 75% , this selection is equivalent to @xmath265 , shown in blue .",
    "such galaxies appear as starbursts for @xmath266 myr because such extreme intensity , relative to the accumulated mass , is rare and short - lived .",
    "[ fig : burst],width=268 ]    in figure [ fig : burst ] we run fbm models ( @xmath101 ) , take those models that meet starburst criteria at half a hubble time , and compute what fraction of those starbursts would remain classified as such at later intervals .",
    "we calculate that of those stellar disks that have @xmath267 ( green line ) , 50% would meet still this threshold a fifth of a hubble time later . as an example , more than half of the starbursting disk galaxies at @xmath268 would no longer be classified as starbursts by @xmath269 ( while many other disk galaxies would be , thus preserving the 20 - 25% starburst fraction ) . and while 26% of the starbursts from @xmath243 would still be classified as starbursts at @xmath179 , @xmath182 of these would not necessarily have been classified as starbursts during the intervening periods of time .",
    "but as galaxy bulges are assembled at late times the timescales over which galaxies appear as starbursts is shorter galaxies with bulge mass fractions of 50% at @xmath270 , for example , require @xmath271 to be classified as starbursts ( orange line ) , and more than half of these starbursts would no longer be identified as such by @xmath272 , @xmath273th of a hubble time later . for galaxies with even higher bulge fractions the duration is even shorter .",
    "note that in each of these cases the timescales are set because the galaxy masses increase rapidly , and when star - formation stochastically dips , the galaxies cease to be classified as starbursts .",
    "typically this happens after the `` starbursts '' increase the ( disk ) mass by @xmath274 .",
    "we remind the reader that these statistics for starbursts , and their lifetimes , are derived from the distributions of sfrs that must be present when galaxies grow according to a stochastic process of the kind described in  [ sec : process ] . within a specific period of time ,",
    "a galaxy of a given mass could have only experienced a specific set of growth histories .",
    "the set of histories is governed by the assumption that , on average , sfrs do not change from one timestep to the next , and the central limit theorem sets the probability that can be attached to each possible history .",
    "the convergence , in distribution , of the long - term correlations between stochastic changes in sfr modifies these probabilities and broadens the set of possible histories .",
    "when star - formation is not a stationary stochastic process , the results will change , such as our simple calculations that take into account a broader range of bulge mass fractions .",
    "processes that grow bulges while adding to _ in situ _ star - formation may modify these deduced probabilities , but only if the sum of processes can not be reduced to , e.g. , equation [ eq : ff ] .    because the sfms encodes so little information about star - formation timescales ,",
    "no individual starburst can be assigned a timescale over which it has endured such intense stellar mass growth without additional data . on average , however , the mathematics of stochastic processes relates the duty cycles directly to the hubble time at every epoch . for galaxies at @xmath275 , @xcite estimated starburst duty cycles of @xmath276 , consistent with the predictions shown in figure [ fig : burst ] .",
    "stochasticity , through the dispersion in sfhs and distribution of ssfrs at fixed mass , also provides estimates for the fraction of disks that are quiescent at any given epoch .",

    "galaxies with zero ongoing star - formation are not the only galaxies that can be classified as quiescent .",

    "[ fig : powerspec2],width=268 ]    figure [ fig : powerspec2 ] quantifies this problem . here",
    "we show using the green curve the fraction of ( disk ) galaxies selected as quiescent at half a hubble time that would retain such classification at later times . within 25% of a hubble time",
    "more than half of the quiescent population has already cycled back into the star - forming population . and",
    "likewise for those ( disk ) galaxies classified as quiescent today ( but looking back in time ) .",
    "the correspondence between quiescent galaxies at some distant time in the past and those today appears to be quite poor . and",
    "these disks wo nt care if they have bulges  only their aggregate ssfrs will be lower , increasing their chances of being classified as quiescent ( see below ) but growing in mass nonetheless .",
    "the mathematics for the stochastic evolution of the disk components of galaxies likely continues as derived , independent of bulge mass .",
    "assuming such recycling is occurring , there are broad consequences for comparisons of the properties of ensembles of ( quiescent ) galaxies over long redshift baselines .",
    "any analysis that requires progenitorship ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and others ) must fully model such recycling of galaxies .",
    "the tracing , for example , of the sizes of quiescent galaxies over time must be seen in a context where the resumption of stellar mass growth is not only routine , but is essentially part of the normal process by which all galaxies grow ( not just the quiescent ones ) .",
    "we emphasize this point in figure [ fig : timescales ] , in which we plot the cumulative distributions of timescales when ( disk ) galaxies reach 16% , 50% , and 84% of their present - day masses ( or at least the masses at the time of observation ) .",
    "the full distribution is shown by the solid lines . here",
    "we see that 50% of these ( disk ) galaxies reach 50% of their present - day mass by relatively late times , about 1/3 of a hubble time ago . and",
    "about a quarter of the galaxies reach their 50% mass point almost 2/3 of a hubble time ago . for comparison , but",
    "not shown , t050% of ( disk ) galaxies selected as quiescent today reached 84% of their present - day mass 40% of a hubble time ago .",
    "half of them reached half their present - day mass by @xmath281 .",
    "but figure [ fig : timescales ] specifically shows the continued mass growth for those disks that would have been classified as quiescent at half a hubble time .",
    "more than half of them have not yet reached 50% of their present - day masses , as that wo nt have happened until @xmath282 .    , in red , blue , and violet , respectively .",
    "the solid lines trace the cumulative mass evolution for disks selected as quiescent at @xmath179 , whereas the dashed lines show the continued mass evolution for disks selected as quiescent at half a hubble time ( @xmath243 ) . for galaxies with significant bulge mass fractions ,",
    "a larger fraction of galaxies will be counted as quiescent but their disks will maintain distributions of mass growth similar to that shown here , with consequences for their evolving stellar populations , galaxy sizes , and internal structures . [ fig : timescales],width=264 ]    note that these calculations are for galaxies without bulges  without spheroidal mass components that appear older than the disks because the mass formed _ ex situ _ is comprised of stars taken out of the continued history of stochastic mass growth .",
    "galaxies with ( old ) bulges may or may not see different sfhs for their stellar disks , depending on their situations .",
    "of course quiescent galaxies tend to live in rich , high - density environments at low- and high - redshifts @xcite .",
    "how will these galaxies continue to acquire the new material out of which must grow new stellar mass ? even at the present epoch ,",
    "only @xmath283 of the stellar mass density of the universe is locked into regions that can no longer support ongoing star - formation @xcite . in the past ,",
    "galaxies that reached states of quiescence would still have been in relatively low - mass groups , and these groups continue to accrete and grow with time , bringing fresh fuel to rejuvenate stellar disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus all studies of the evolution of quiescent galaxies over time must account for ( 1 ) mechanisms that stochastically reignite star - formation in the old disks of quiescent galaxies , presumably in disks , or ( 2 ) recent stochastic emergence of quiescent galaxies out of those populations of galaxies that were recently forming stars . assuming some mean",
    "mass growth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) does not mitigate against these issues .",
    "the martingale central limit theorem remains valid even when superposed on long - term trends .",
    "we discussed some potential long - term trends that would add and subtract from our predictions of stellar mass growth earlier , but choose for the moment not to fit any data to constrain such long - term processes  partly because doing so is beyond the scope of this purely theoretical paper , and partly because so much of the mathematics appear to be degenerate .    in this section",
    "we recognize that there is a significant change in the slope of the sfms at high masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we simply superimpose our statistical framework onto the observed change in slope at high mass .",
    "this is functionally equivalent to incorporating the relevant processes to recover the proper form of the sfms . for simplicity",
    "we adopt the broken power - law form found by @xcite , but assume that below @xmath284 , @xmath285 $ ] is a constant defined by our fbm models with @xmath101 , and above that mass there is a slope of @xmath286 dex / dex .",
    "we also adopt the scatter derived with @xmath101 , knowing that the central limit theorem remains operable when superposed on long - term expectations .",
    "we expect that an additional process , or additional processes , have produced the anticorrelation at high masses and the dispersion in the ensemble is expected to remain @xmath287=\\mathcal{e}[\\text{ssfr}]$ ] .",
    "the baseline ssfr and scatter are shown in figure [ fig : sloan](a ) using the violet horizontal lines .",
    "the broken power - law form is shown in green . using only this diagram ,",
    "we compute quiescent fractions as a function of mass .",
    "later we will discuss how this change in slope may arise in the context of our derived equations .",
    "to first order , all galaxies below the solid red line ( ssfr @xmath288 ) are quiescent . and if additional star - formation is attenuated by @xmath289 mag , those galaxies may rejoin the quiescent clump within @xmath290 yr ( at least in a @xmath291 diagram ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus there is an effective quiescence cut shown by the dashed red line whereby low levels of recent , attenuated star - formation are inconsequential .",
    "when superposed on galaxies with bulges , such star - formation is , fractionally , even less consequential @xcite .",
    "we have propagated the fbm sfhs , including a secondary process of _ ex situ _ mass growth to mimic the departure from @xmath285 $ ] at high masses , through stellar population synthesis models .",
    "the resulting @xmath156 and @xmath157 bicolor distribution is shown in figure [ fig : sloan](b ) , assuming solar metallicity and no dust attenuation , and , despite these shortcomings the distribution looks similar to those found in existing surveys @xcite . using the @xcite boundaries to select quiescent from star - forming , we compute the quiescent galaxy fraction as a function of stellar mass , shown in figure [ fig : sloan](c ) by the black solid line . just using the predicted lognormal scatter , plus the 16% of galaxies with @xmath292 at @xmath293 ( see  [ sec : recycle ] ) , one can estimate a rough trend of quiescent fraction with galaxy stellar mass , shown by the red line in figure [ fig : sloan](b ) . the observed quiescent galaxy fractions from sdss @xcite",
    "are shown in blue and match surprising well , though the @xcite definition of quiescent was defined using color - magnitude relations . because we have no dust attenuation in our simple tests , we have opted to rely on the @xmath291 criteria .",
    "furthermore , at the present epoch , @xmath294 of the stellar mass density of the universe is locked into regions that can no longer support ongoing star - formation @xcite and these simple models have not enhanced the quiescent fractions to account for the increased volume comprised of such evolutionary dead - ends .    despite these shortcomings ,",
    "the model works surprisingly well . when comparing to higher redshift data",
    "some of the more problematic issues are mitigated , such as the diminished contributions of the richest groups and clusters to the global average , and the more common selection of quiescent galaxies using @xmath291 diagrams .",
    "so in figure [ fig : zfourge ] we perform the same exercise at redshifts @xmath295 and @xmath281 , making direct comparisons to the quiescent galaxy fractions in z - fourge @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig : zfourge](a , c ) show the sfms , with the assumed anticorrelation at high masses .",
    "overlayed are data from @xcite and @xcite , to illustrate that the model sfmss are reasonable starting points .",
    "simple integrations over the underlying dispersion in ssfr are shown by the red lines in figures [ fig : zfourge](b , d ) , and are analogous to that shown in figure [ fig : sloan](c ) . but to better match the published data , we have constructed magnitudes in the observed frame , `` selecting '' the samples to be limited at @xmath296 mag , the limit of the z - fourge survey .",
    "the resulting quiescent galaxy fractions are shown by the black lines , which closely mimic the observed quiescent fractions shown in blue .    while careful modeling of the observational errors , dust attenuations , stellar abundances , and selection effects may improve the overall quality of the mimicry , the basic match between the model expectations and the data is striking .",
    "such estimations call into question the validity of separating galaxies into categories based on quiescence , and we suggest that a broader view be taken when modeling the evolving distributions of ( all ) galaxies over time .    these results should not be taken to imply that there are no quiescent galaxies in the universe . just as in the discussion of starburst galaxies , these results suggest that these classifications oversimplify the evolution of the ensembles .",
    "quiescent galaxies are a heterogeneous population , arising from a range of histories .",
    "processes that stifle star - formation in one set perhaps should not be assumed to have been the dominant mechanisms that lead other galaxies to appear as quiescent .",
    "earlier we discussed several avenues for expanding the formalism of stochastic processes , including ones that can increase a the probabilities for quiescence over time : _ ex situ _ mass growth , variable timescales for stochastic changes in _ in situ _ mass growth , and diminished fuel supplies or star - formation efficiencies .",
    "any of these may be operable , but the underlying astrophysical causes are sufficiently different that one would not wish to put those galaxies that appear quiescent because of each process into a single category .",
    "additional data must be used to better constrain the mechanisms that drive relative quiescence , such as the utilization of bulge mass fractions by @xcite .",
    "monolithic probabilistic formalisms are very likely not helpful , but a wealth of data regarding galaxy environments , star - formation rate densities , structural parameters , and galaxy mass functions , should all be relied upon .    we invoked no mechanisms to permanently quench galaxies or make them appear quiescent , outside of ( 1 ) whatever modest astrophysical events stochastically change star - formation over time , and ( 2 ) whatever process imposes the modest anticorrelation of ssfr with galaxy mass at the high - mass end of the mass function .",
    "at least part of this change in slope is due to an increase in bulge mass , systematically depressing ssfr so that one under - appreciates the extent to which those galaxies are continuing to grow .    the simplest model for star - forming disks invokes no stochastic changes to star - formation over time , producing long - term expectations of @xmath92 with zero intrinsic scatter .",
    "this is mathematically equivalent to @xmath91 and functionally equivalent to the models of @xcite .",
    "in such a model no galaxies ever reach quiescence without the invocation of additional mathematical tools or probabilistic approaches to galaxy quenching .",
    "the reader may conclude from all these derivations that we have merely rederived the @xcite approach , but with enough moments in the calculations to avoid making quenching fraction a model parameter . from a distance",
    "this interpretation may be appealing , but it would miss ( 1 ) the salient point that galaxies only stochastically `` quench '' temporarily , and ( 2 ) that no adoption of a universal star - formation efficiency is required or even relevant .",
    "furthermore , one can very nearly calculate the quiescent galaxy fraction at a given stellar mass with almost no data whatsoever .    without even knowing any of the critical mechanisms , a shocking amount of the statistical properties of galaxies and their evolution with time has now been deduced and",
    "we can only rather anticlimactically conclude that the rise of quiescent galaxies at late times was largely inevitable  the result of modest dispersion in ssfr at fixed mass coupled with an anticorrelation of ssfr with @xmath33 at high masses .",
    "statistical distributions of astronomical objects offer the most insight into astrophysical events , timescales , and processes , and have played this role for nearly a century @xcite .",
    "often there are correlations between properties , such as with galaxy sizes , luminosities , characteristic velocities , line absorption , and others ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sdss has revolutionized such studies by ballooning collective dataset of galaxies by factors of many thousands ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    out of such large samples emerge patterns such as the correlation between on - going rates of star - formation with galaxy mass @xcite .",
    "such results appear when a practically infinite number of objects have been averaged to reveal mean behaviors and properties .",
    "but by averaging the properties of an infinite number of objects we are using the universe as an analog computer to derive the asymptotic behavior of an ensemble , top compute the limiting behavior of such properties in distribution .",
    "so when such distributions are observed , and mean behaviors are revealed , do they mean nothing ?",
    "the work presented in this paper provides an ambiguous answer .    to zeroth order",
    "the existence of a correlation between sfr and @xmath33 indeed means very little , as a number of theories and frameworks have been published that non - uniquely construct such a correlation .",
    "that the scatter in the sfms is so low has led many to draw significant conclusions about how _",
    "individual _ galaxies form and grow , leading to quite sophisticated models @xcite . in such frameworks , powerful quenching mechanisms have been postulated , and required , to explain the rise of quiescent galaxies over time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    our work ,",
    "however , has shown that the limiting behavior of ensembles can not be used to infer the paths of individual galaxies .",
    "but in deriving basic properties of the ensembles of star - forming galaxies from first principles , we have uncovered what is essentially a set of nondifferentiable basis functions with which one can model galaxy sfhs . with each of these sfhs",
    "even come probability densities , though our framework clearly requires additional pieces to fully model galaxy assembly , let alone the assembly of their dark matter halos .",
    "simple , deterministic frameworks for galaxy evolution are understandably attractive , even  or especially  in the face of chaotic cosmological simulations .",
    "such frameworks make for convenient equations , with terms that appear to confirm intuition and provide insight . without such relatively simple mathematical frameworks ,",
    "it has been difficult to make progress deciphering galaxy distributions over cosmic time .",
    "fortunately , 20th and 21st century mathematical tools are available to better comprehend the evolving distributions of galaxies , though the differences between the philosophy that underpins this new work and competing analytical and semi - analytical frameworks could not be more striking .    with no assumptions about star - forming efficiency or gas fractions , central limit theory for stochastic processes yields a star - forming main sequence that agrees with the ssfrs of ( star - forming , low - ish - mass ) galaxies over @xmath297 .",
    "our derivations show that their median ssfr declines as @xmath77 , is independent of disk stellar mass , is independent of the timescale for stochastic changes in stellar mass growth , and does not depend on a universal efficiency of star - formation .",
    "ultimately  because galaxies `` remember '' what they ve done before  one parameter was introduced that controls the aggregate distribution of covariance , but its value is itself highly constrained by the data to be @xmath101 , both through the differences between published mean and median ssfrs , and the definition that median ssfr scales as @xmath298 .",
    "there is real intrinsic dispersion in @xmath107 of @xmath299 dex , depending on the method of measurement and on the nature of one s sample selection .",
    "and while such a model is extreme in its unattractiveness , it has a precision and accuracy that is unparalleled in its lack of free parameters .",
    "the accuracy with which the retrodictions and data agree implies that the sfms can be used to measure cosmological parameters , with data from the literature constraining the hubble constant to 5% ( random , and 7% systematic ) .",
    "constructing a method to turn star - forming galaxies into standard clocks was not the intent of the work , but the agreement between the predictions and the data has broad implications for the underlying sfhs of galaxies in general .",
    "we summarize some of the key points here :        @xmath300 there is a distribution in ssfrs at any epoch , and at the present epoch this distribution produces a scatter in @xmath183 ratios consistent with the scatter in the tully - fisher relation @xcite .",
    "@xmath300 the evolution of the shape of the stellar mass function is naturally explained by the time - dependence of the expectation values for sfr and stellar mass , such that mass evolution does not keep up with the increasing linear size of logarithmic mass bins .",
    "this is a primary reason why the late - time double @xcite function naturally transitions to a single @xcite function at high redshift .",
    "@xmath300 the population of quiescent galaxies ( at least at late times ) is heterogeneous and comprised of galaxies that have not permanently quenched .",
    "many have sfrs that are only temporarily low , though those that were quenched and have zero on - going star - formation may stay that way for half a hubble time .",
    "even though these conclusions can already be drawn from these first steps towards understanding the statistical distributions of galaxies , the modeling does not yet include _ ex situ _ sources of stellar mass , or any attendant treatment of the host dark matter halos .",
    "furthermore , no attempt has been made to connect particular stochastic changes in @xmath13 to astrophysical processes .",
    "the central limit theorem has so far been applied in a vacuum , while simulations and galaxy formation theory may , for example , allow us to restrict which fbm paths are potentially unphysical .",
    "with a more complete model , however , we expect to be able to derive plausible , global probability densities for the broad range of possible galaxy formation histories at each epoch .",
    "such distributions might then allow for the construction of more complete sets of plausible sed templates for photometric redshift surveys with sensible priors , for example . at a minimum , however , all astrophysical processes should be seen to sit on top of the derivations and predictions made here .    while there are other ways to model correlations of sfr with galaxy mass over cosmic time ,",
    "each requires direct fits of parametrized functions to observed star - formation rates and stellar mass functions @xcite , or by inferring star - formation histories from the evolution of the sfrd and distributions of star - formation rates @xcite .",
    "none of these constraints should necessarily be seen as orthogonal , as they are tackling different aspects of the same problem .",
    "it should be noted that nowhere did we derive a mass function from first principles  only the sfms .",
    "the downside is that all governing physics has been shifted to spectra of perturbations , where the future histories of @xmath203 s ultimately determine what range of masses an object may attain in the future .",
    "perhaps the matter power spectrum , merger trees , and the predicted evolution of the halo mass functions will provide a basic framework for calculating the spectrum of @xmath82 s but such efforts are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "other frameworks have also been made to agree with data @xcite .",
    "but free of any fine - tuning , the agreement between our mathematical framework and observations implies that the growth of ( disk ) galaxies is a stochastic process , in the mathematical sense .",
    "the sfms is therefore not a deterministic law , dictating that galaxies have higher star - formation rates as they grow .",
    "galaxies at fixed mass exhibit a range of star - formation rates only because of the central limit theorem . in other words ,",
    "the sfms is _ descriptive _ , not _",
    "prescriptive_.    a model with no physics and no determinism is not attractive , but a surprising amount about galaxy evolution emerges anyway .",
    "how can this be ?",
    "to first order , the answer lies in the fact that most galactic observations of astrophysical and cosmological interest are deeply connected to ssfr  colors , @xmath301 ratios , @xmath183 ratios , absorption and emission line equivalent widths .",
    "if all of our observations are ratios of property @xmath302 to @xmath303 or some suitable mapping thereof , how do we proceed to learn anything when their behavior in distributions are the result of central limit theorems ? perhaps ancillary data , such as structural parameters and direct measurements of bulge and disk sizes or masses will provide helpful clues ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "but the interpretation of such results , again , may not be unique : are galaxies in high - density environments losing their disks ? failing to regrow disks",
    "? growing their bulges ? experiencing longer timescales between stochastic events ?",
    "this last option is a particularly novel outcome of the derivations and should be explored further , given that stochastic change likely occurs on the dynamical timescales of one s halo .",
    "naturally , satellites must experience stochasticity on timescales defined by the halos of their hosts , compared to galaxies of the same mass that reside in their own halos .",
    "large , complete , statistical modeling may resolve these degeneracies , but only if one begins with a sensible statistical framework . the one presented here",
    "is not yet complete , as the mathematics for stochastically driving bulge growth , starving fuel supplies , or lengthening timescales of stochasticity have not been fully incorporated . nor has this model been placed in a modern cosmological context . in this framework ,",
    "how do dark matter halos grow ?",
    "the growth of stellar mass is particularly chaotic and the large dispersion in fractional mass growth at any given time quickly erases any one - to - one mapping of halo mass to stellar mass from one timestep to the next  especially when timescales may also vary randomly , or at least remain unencoded in the sfms .",
    "the sfms is thought of as a scaling relation , but it is correlations between a time - variable property and its integral .",
    "other such correlations may be reducible in a similar fashion , such as ( 1 ) the long - term evolution of the zeropoint , slope , and scatter for the mass - metallicity relation for galaxies @xcite ; ( 2 ) the long - term evolution of the zeropoint , slope , and scatter for the correlation between @xmath304}$ ] and @xmath305}$ ] for galaxies @xcite ; ( 3 ) the dispersion in eddington ratios for agn , whereby one is also taking the ratio of a mass growth rate to the integral of that rate @xcite , or ( 4 ) the slope and scatter of kennicutt - schmidt - style correlations @xcite , among many other knotty topics .",
    "pessimists among us may push the most deeply unsettling aspects of this work to the extreme , whereby the dominant processes that shape and grow galaxies may never be satisfactorily resolved .",
    "perhaps there are profound limits to what we may truly learn from the distributions of galaxy properties over cosmic time .",
    "certainly this work should provide a cautionary tale , that statistical astronomy may not have led us to an oasis of knowledge but merely to an attractive mirage . and",
    "perhaps we are only a quarter of the way through our forty years",
    ".    some readers may be concerned that abandoning deterministic laws is tantamount to dismissing galaxy study as futile .",
    "our conclusions do not fit neatly into the dominant analytical paradigms , and humans have been searching for the natural laws that govern the heavens for quite a while .",
    "however , we may have merely , finally recognized the deeply statistical nature of the problems , and perhaps ever more powerful mathematical tools will lead to greater , or more nuanced , understanding .",
    "after all , underpinning all the mathematical chaos in galaxy evolution are the astrophysical processes of ram - pressure stripping , tidal interactions , accretion , agn , winds , and supernovae feedback , reionization , hot halos , etc , and these all remain critically important foci of study .",
    "one should now think of these as processes that drive stochasticity , but perhaps observationally as processes that move galaxies around the diagrams of ssfr and mass , moving them around with respect to expectation values at each epoch , and for specific timescales . with modern mathematical tools , such as the martingale central limit theorem ,",
    "we have only taken the first steps in what are clearly going to be new , exciting opportunities for investigation .",
    "l. abramson and a. dressler are grudgingly thanked for talking too loudly in the hallway about the sfms .",
    "a. benson is thanked for giving early drafts a look .",
    "detailed editing by r. powers made the text more palatable , and a. dressler provided helpful suggestions for to ensure a broader reach .",
    "b. mandelbrot is also posthumously thanked for bringing kolmogorov s fbm models to a wider audience .",
    "gratitude is expressed to r.  j. williams for seeing early on that this work might not be totally bogus . for tolerating the kinds of diversions that lead down such unexpected rabbit holes : deep gratitude to the carnegie institution .",
