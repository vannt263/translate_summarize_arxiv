    "the universe at high redshift looks very different from that at low redshift and local . at the epoch of @xmath7 , a large fraction of massive galaxies are still active , and their morphology are quite different from that of nearby galaxies @xcite . in order to examine current theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution ,",
    "studies of galaxies over a wide range of lookback time are needed @xcite . within the past decade , many novel techniques have been applied to assemble multi - wavelength observations of galaxies at this important epoch and significant progress has been made in our understanding of high - redshift galaxies @xcite .    at early time , one method for selecting high - redshift galaxies is the lyman break technique , which uses the significant break at 912  in the galaxy rest - frame uv spectrum to select star - forming galaxies ( so - called lyman break galaxies , or lbgs ) , and was first applied at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the lbgs are uv - bright star - forming galaxies and dominated by relatively low - mass systems ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "consider that most of local elliptical and s0 galaxies commonly have stellar masses great than @xmath10 , the lbgs may not be the progenitors of these massive galaxies today @xcite , and the lyman break technique have missed a significant population of red massive galaxies at high redshift , such as distant red galaxies ( drgs ) @xcite , bzks @xcite , ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) @xcite , etc . as a supplement to these uv - bright lbgs , @xcite introduced a new photometric technique for selecting @xmath11 massive red galaxies .",
    "the relevant spectral break is the balmer break at 3650  which attributes to the spectral shape of young stars and the 4000  break which is caused by the absorption of metals in old stars .",
    "since these breaks shift into the @xmath12 band at @xmath7 , a red @xmath3 color is a simple and effective criterion @xcite .",
    "they simulated the tracks in the @xmath3 color versus redshift diagram with model spectra taken from bruzual & charlot 1993 , and imposed a criterion @xmath13 for selecting galaxies at @xmath11 ( so - called distant red galaxies , or drgs ) .",
    "drgs commonly have higher star formation rates ( sfrs ) ( @xmath14yr ) and more dust extinctions ( @xmath15 mag ) @xcite .",
    "the redshift distribution of drgs is quite broad , and the @xmath13 selection criterion does not uniquely sample high - mass galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , drg selection technique does locate very massive galaxies ( @xmath16 ) at @xmath11 @xcite . in the present - day universe ,",
    "most of massive ( @xmath17 ) galaxies are quiescent systems . on the contrary , at @xmath7 a large proportion of massive galaxies",
    "are still active , while others are `` red and dead '' with little or no ongoing star - forming activities @xcite .",
    "transformation from the active systems into the evolved systems is a reasonable explanation to this dramatic evolution .",
    "some studies suggested that drgs show properties of both passive systems and dust obscured active systems @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed color tracks for stellar population models @xcite in the @xmath18 vs. @xmath19)$ ] diagram , and found that 70% of drgs are well fit with dusty star - forming models and 30% are best described by old stellar population models . @xcite",
    "combined spitzer 24@xmath20 m flux , and found a similar percentage ( @xmath2165% ) of drgs are dusty active galaxies . by studying the spectra , @xcite found that the stellar populations differ greatly among drgs , from dusty starburst with small break to evolved galaxy with strong break and no line emission , and both the h@xmath22 measurements and stellar continuum modeling imply 45% of @xmath0-selected massive galaxies at @xmath7 are not forming stars intensely .",
    "the morphologies of drgs are diverse .",
    "@xcite analyzed the morphologies of drgs in the hubble ultra deep field based on hst advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) images and near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) images , and found that the rest - frame optical morphology of drg is quite different from the rest - frame uv morphology . in the near - infrared images ,",
    "some drgs are extended and others are compact .",
    "@xcite examined the morphologies of drgs in the extended groth strip ( egs ) field based on acs f814w images with eye - ball and nonparametric classification method , and found that the morphologies of drgs show a diversity of types at all redshifts , from elliptical , peculiar to disk .",
    "the @xmath13 criteria is a simple but outstanding selection method utilising the 3650 and 4000 breaks for high-@xmath6 massive red galaxies , which are supplements to those uv - bright low - mass lbgs .",
    "the drg sample provides us with the chance to investigate the nature of the population of the massive red objects at high redshifts , which are supposed to be the progenitors of local massive populations , thus it makes us better understand the evolution of massive galaxies .",
    "since the drg samples of previous research programs are commonly small ( @xmath23 ) , it still remains many uncertainties on the physical properties of distant red galaxies . in order to have a thorough understanding of this kind of galaxies , in this paper we present the largest sample of drgs so far , which is selected from the cosmos / ultravista field , based on the high quality nir data presented by @xcite and @xcite . to clearly describe the details of the characteristics of drgs",
    ", we investigate the correlations between their sfrs , redshifts , masses and morphologies .",
    "the rest - frame uv emission of galaxies is mainly contributed by the hottest stars and can be severely affected by dust extinction , therefore it is essential to study @xmath7 galaxies from observed nir bands , which probe the rest - frame optical morphologies .",
    "our morphology analysis was enabled by the hst wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) nir imaging of the cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels)@xcite , and we compare the nonparametric measure of galaxy morphology with visual inspection and uvj color - color diagram . in the meanwhile ,",
    "we also compare drg with other color selection criteria .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the @xmath0-selected catalog of the cosmos / ultravista field in section 2 , and the drg sample selection method and classification in section 3 .",
    "we show our results on physical properties of drgs in section 4 .",
    "we compare the drg method with other color selection methods in section 5 , and conclude our results in section 6 . throughout this paper , we assume an @xmath24 and @xmath25 km s@xmath26 mpc@xmath26 cosmology , and all magnitudes and colors are given in ab system unless stated otherwise .",
    "symbol such as `` [ 3.6 ] '' means the ab magnitude at the wavelength 3.6 @xmath20 m .",
    "the cosmos field is centered at @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( j2000.0 ) , and covers an area of @xmath29 square degree @xcite .",
    "the cosmos project gathers a variety of ground- and space - based observations , covering nearly the whole spectrum range @xcite .",
    "the multi - band photometry data we used in this paper come from the @xmath0-selected catalog of the cosmos / ultravista field provided by @xcite , which is produced based on the near infrared ( nir ) data from the ultravista data release 1 @xcite .",
    "the high - quality and deep - enough nir data make it possible for us to select a large sample of drgs .",
    "the catalog contains psf - matched photometry in 30 photometric bands covering the wavelength from 0.15@xmath20 m to 24@xmath20 m , and includes the available galex @xcite , cfht / subaru @xcite , ultravista @xcite , s - cosmos @xcite , and zcosmos @xcite datasets . after removing regions contaminated by bright stars ,",
    "the effective area of overlap between optical and nir data is 1.62 deg@xmath30 .",
    "the photometry in all bands is corrected for galactic dust attenuation , and stars are separated from galaxies using the @xmath31 vs. @xmath32 color space , and it agrees well with sextractor s class@xmath33star parameters .",
    "the catalog is presented as a set of fluxes in the @xmath34 color aperture with an ab zeropoint of 25.0 , and the 90@xmath35 completeness limit of the catalog is @xmath36 = 23.4 .",
    "the derived physical parameters we used in this paper also come from the catalog provided by @xcite .",
    "photometric redshifts are derived for all galaxies using the eazy code @xcite with 30 bands , and have been calibrated by the highest - quality spectroscopic redshifts from zcosmos .",
    "the stellar population parameters such as stellar mass ( @xmath4 ) , age , @xmath37 , sfr@xmath38 are derived by sed fitting method in fast code @xcite .",
    "the rest - frame uv luminosity is derived by eazy . *",
    "the total ir luminosity is derived by fitting the 24@xmath20 m flux using the log - average of the @xcite templates , but note that using the log - average of the @xcite templates would provide very similar results . *",
    "then the rest - frame uv and the total ir luminosities are converted to sfr@xmath39 and sfr@xmath40 according to @xcite .",
    "the total star formation rate of the galaxy can then be determined via sfr@xmath41 sfr@xmath42 sfr@xmath40 .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath43 and @xmath44 colors are calculated for all galaxies by eazy , which determines the colors by integrating the best - fit sed through the redshifted filter curves over the appropriate wave length range .",
    "to select a sample of drgs from ultravista catalog , firstly we remove all the objects classified as stars and contaminated galaxies defined by @xcite . in order to make our photometric selecting criterion close to the original drg selecting criterion introduced by @xcite",
    ", we make a simulation in bc03 code @xcite to determine the corrections for @xmath12 and @xmath0 bands .",
    "finally , we set a small correction for @xmath3 color : @xmath45 ( ab ) , so we set @xmath46 ( ab ) , which is equivalent to @xmath47 ( ab ) , as the criterion for selecting drgs . on the other hand , we carefully compared the location of the stellar sequence with previous works , and find the distance on @xmath3 color between stellar sequence and drg selecting criterion is 1.36 , which is consistent with previous works @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the @xmath0-selected galaxies ( objects in masked area are removed ) in the @xmath31 vs. @xmath0 diagram , the dashed line represents @xmath48 , which is our drg selecting criterion , objects above which are all drgs and are plotted in red color .",
    "the dot - dashed line represents the stellar sequence , and all stars are plotted in green color . the total number of drgs we select from the cosmos / ultravista field is 4485 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 mag * ( therefore , all drgs in our sample actually have @xmath51 mag ) .",
    "*    figure 2 shows the @xmath0-band differential number counts of drgs and all @xmath0-selected galaxies . for comparison ,",
    "we have also plotted the number count results from other literature . in this figure ,",

    "as shown by this figure , our number counts of drgs and all @xmath0-selected galaxies in the cosmos / ultravista field are in good agreement with those in previous works in other fields .",
    "as shown by previous literatures @xcite , drg is a diverse population , most of the drgs are dusty star - forming galaxies while others are old and red with little on going star formation activities . in order to specify the details of the physical properties and the evolution of them , separating drgs into star - forming and quiescent populations",
    "is necessary .",
    "we classify our sample as star - forming drgs ( sdrgs ) and quiescent drgs ( qdrgs ) based on the rest - frame uvj color criteria defined by @xcite . according to their definition , qdrgs",
    "are classified by : @xmath52,\\ ] ] @xmath53,\\ ] ] @xmath54.\\ ] ] otherwise , they are star - forming drgs .",
    "these classification criteria are plotted as dashed lines in figure 3 .",
    "based on this classification method , we identify 3725 sdrgs and 760 qdrgs , the percentage of sdrgs is 83% , which is a little higher than previous results @xcite .",
    "morphologies of drgs provide direct information on the formation and evolution history of these objects , and correlate a range of physical properties such as stellar mass , sfr and rest - frame color .",
    "it is difficult to study morphologies of high redshift dusty galaxies based on their observed optical images , because their observed optical light probes the rest - frame uv emission for objects at @xmath7 , and their apparent morphologies can be easily changed by patchy dust extinction .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that drgs have peculiar , clumpy morphologies in the @xmath55/acs f814w band image .",
    "based on the @xmath55 nicmos-@xmath56 ( @xmath57/pixel ) and acs-@xmath58 ( @xmath59/pixel ) images , however , @xcite found that the rest - frame optical morphology of drgs is quite different from the rest - frame uv morphology .",
    "the rest - frame uv emission of galaxies mainly contributed by the hottest stars and can be severely affected by dust extinction , therefore it is essential to study @xmath7 galaxies from observed nir bands which probe the rest - frame optical morphologies .",
    "our morphology analysis was enabled by the @xmath55/wfc3 nir imaging with a resolution of @xmath60/pixel from the cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels ) @xcite .",
    "since the redshift distribution of drgs is quite broad , we analyze their rest - frame optical morphologies on wfc3 f125w ( @xmath12 ) or f160w ( @xmath61 ) bands according to their redshifts . for drgs with @xmath62 , we choose wfc3 f125w ( @xmath12 ) bandpass for morphological analysis , it corresponds approximately to @xmath63-band in the rest - frame in this redshift range , but in the redshift range of @xmath64 , we analyze galaxy morphology in the rest - frame @xmath63 from the f160w ( @xmath61 ) image instead . finally ,",
    "37 drgs in our sample have @xmath12-band counterparts ( @xmath62 ) , and 95 drgs ( @xmath64 ) are detected at @xmath61-band image .",
    "the sensitivity ( 5@xmath65 ) of the candels imaging data reach 27 mag in the f125w and the f160w , and all of drgs in our sample are brighter than 24 mag in both @xmath12 and @xmath61 bands , thus the candels data is deep enough to morphologically classify this drg sample .",
    "we perform the visual inspection for this sample by three of us independently , we combined each classifier s results and review the images together to resolve the disagreements .",
    "the disagreements cover about 10% of this sample , and mainly exist among galaxies which ca nt be clearly classified as disks or irregular galaxies .",
    "we find that the drgs in our sample show very diversified morphologies , covering a wide range of types from extended disks , compact spheroids to clumpy and irregular morphologies .",
    "we define three general morphological types as follows :    spheroid : :    : round and centrally concentrated source with no extended structure .",
    "disk : :    : single bright core with smooth extended disk - like structure .",
    "irregular : :    : clumpy structure with more than two bright cores , sometimes shows    interaction features such as tidal arms .",
    "examples of three morphological types are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the result of the visual inspection supports the finding that the significant evolution of the hubble sequence has already existed at high redshift @xcite . in table 1",
    "we list the numbers of star - forming and quiescent drgs classified by rest - frame uvj colors in three visual morphological types . among star - forming drgs ,",
    "the spheroids occupy a proportion of 19.8% , disks occupy 32.7% and irregulars make up 47.5% . and among quiescent drgs , the spheroids make up 77.4% , disks make up 16.1% and irregulars make up 6.5% .",

    "we compare the redshift distributions of drgs with those of all of galaxies in four stellar mass bins in figure 6 .",
    "we find that in higher mass bins ( e.g. , @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) , drgs represent nearly all of galaxies at @xmath11 . at @xmath82 and @xmath11 ,",
    "the fraction of drgs out of all galaxies is 70% , which is in good agreement with @xcite . from the analysis above ,",
    "we demonstrate that although drg selecting criterion also sample low - mass galaxies at low redshifts , drgs occupy large proportion of galaxies at high - mass and high-@xmath6 range , implying that drg selecting criterion is sensitive to massive galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "our results are also demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopy study of @xcite also supports our finding that red galaxies dominate the high - mass end of the galaxy population at @xmath83 .",

    "the distance between the majority of drgs and the 90% completeness boundary at @xmath73 are safe enough , which ensures our drg is a complete sample .",
    "only a very small proportion of drgs are close to the completeness boundary , and most of them are located in low - mass and low-@xmath6 range .",

    "star - forming and quiescent drgs classified by the rest - frame uvj colors are plotted in blue and red , respectively .",
    "we find that most of quiescent drgs are visually compact , and have larger gini and smaller @xmath85 values , while the star - forming drgs contain different kinds of morphological types but most of them are visually extended and have smaller gini and larger @xmath85 values .",
    "similar results are also reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite support our morphological results that quiescent galaxies are commonly found to be ultra - compact , while galaxies with high sfrs have irregular and clumpy morphologies .",
    "our morphological results also support the evolutionary tracks described in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite that compact drgs ( with larger gini and smaller @xmath85 ) contain compact quiescent galaxies ( cqgs ) and their progenitors compact star - forming galaxies ( csfgs ) . in our sample , there are 54.5% ( 24/44 ) spheroidal drgs are quenched , namely they are cqgs , and the rest of them are csfgs .",
    "the csfgs are formed by gas - rich processes such as major mergers at high redshifts , and rapidly quenched ( probably by agn ) into cqgs , most of which are classified as spheroidal quiescent drgs .",

    "the slopes of the sfr@xmath90 correlation of star - forming drgs in different redshift panels are similar . at fixed stellar masses , the sfrs of galaxies on the sfr@xmath90 correlation increase with redshifts , which indicates that star - forming drgs were much more active on average in the past , due to greater abundance of gas in early universe .",

    "we find the ssfrs of drgs increase with redshifts in all stellar mass bins , and drgs with higher stellar masses generally have lower ssfrs .",
    "this is most likely due to the fact that the universe at early time is more active , and massive galaxies formed most of their stars earlier and slowed down more rapidly than their low - mass counterparts , star formation contributes more to the growth of low - mass galaxies than high - mass galaxies .",

    "we find there exists a trend in the sfr@xmath40/sfr@xmath96 vs. @xmath4 diagram of all galaxies : high - mass galaxies tend to have higher sfr@xmath40/sfr@xmath96 ratios , indicating that massive galaxies tend to contain more dust and they are more metal rich , thus the extinction for uv lights are heavier than low - mass galaxies .",
    "similar results are also found by @xcite in their h@xmath22 emitter ( hae ) sample .",
    "we also find drgs occupy the high - mass and high ratio of sfr@xmath40/sfr@xmath96 region , which suggests the @xmath3 color criterion effectively selects the massive dusty sources whose sfr@xmath40 are dominant . as the sfr@xmath40/sfr@xmath96 of most of drgs great than 95% , it is suitable for drgs using the 24 @xmath20 m derived sfr@xmath40 to trace the whole star formation activity .",

    "quiescent and star - forming populations separate obviously in both drg and all @xmath0-selected galaxy samples , which implies that [ 3.6][24 ] color is a good indicator for tracing star - forming status of galaxies .",
    "the similar results were also described in @xcite .",
    "to demonstrate how the drg selection picks up each type of galaxies , we show the fraction of quiescent galaxies and the fraction of dusty star - forming galaxies with @xmath100 selected by the drg criterion as a function of redshift in figure 12 .",

    "the result shown by this figure indicates that heavy dust reddening of @xmath3 color exists among high - mass sfgs , while the @xmath3 color of qgs is irrelevant to mass , because there is no dust extinction , the dramatic increase of the fraction of qgs is due to the sharp balmer or 4000  breaks of older stellar population shift into @xmath12-band at @xmath11 .",
    "galaxies present bi - modal distribution on the rest - frame color vs. mass diagram ( cmd ) , and they show red rest - frame colors due to dust extinction or old stellar ages , thus the bi - modal distribution on cmd suggests two distinct types of galaxy formation histories @xcite .",

    "@xcite find that disk galaxies tend to be more massive and have redder @xmath5 colors than irregular galaxies in their iero sample .",
    "@xcite showed that with a particular @xmath109 color , the high - redshift galaxies had on average higher ssfrs .",
    "figure 13 shows the distribution of drgs on @xmath5 vs. @xmath4 diagram in six redshift bins .",
    "star - forming and quiescent drgs are plotted in blue and red , respectively .",
    "drgs having visual morphological types introduced in section 3.3 are also plotted in corresponding symbols .",
    "we find that the @xmath5 color and @xmath4 of drgs correlate very well in all redshift bins , which is in good agreement with figure 10 : more massive galaxies have redder @xmath5 colors due to their larger internal dust extinctions or old stellar ages , which is also presented by @xcite .",
    "however , star - forming and quiescent drgs can not be separated efficiently on cmd , they do not present clear bimodality , which is similar to what @xcite and @xcite have found .",
    "drgs with similar stellar masses have bluer @xmath5 colors at high redshifts , implying drgs evolve with time , they gradually consume matter materials and eventually slow down their star forming activities @xcite .",
    "we also find that the irregular drgs dominate the reddest @xmath5 color and high - mass end at high - redshifts , but gradually turn bluer and less massive than disk and spheroid drgs toward low - redshifts . at @xmath110 , there are many blue spheroid drgs , they are in the stage of compact star - forming galaxies , which are supposed to be the progenitors of compact qgs at high redshift .",
    "the findings above may indicate a possible evolution scenario that massive disk - like drgs merge with each other frequently by dissipative major merger at high redshifts , and produce massive dust - obscured irregular star - bursts , then through violent relaxation and angular momentum loss , they become spheroid - like drgs and then quenched at later epoch .",
    "the findings are also supported by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "over the past decade , many color selection techniques , which are designed based on rest - frame spectral energy distribution features , are applied to identify high - redshift galaxies @xcite . however , due to the small sizes of samples used in previous works , the overlaps between drg and other color selected population have not been well studied . in this section",
    ", we use our large drg sample to study the overlaps between drgs and eros , bzks , ieros and high redshift ulirgs .",
    "first of all , we study the overlap between drgs and eros . to be consistent with @xcite and @xcite",

    "figure 14 ( a ) shows the distribution of drgs onto @xmath116 vs. @xmath0 diagram .",
    "we find that the distribution on @xmath0 of quiescent drgs is similar to star - forming drgs .",
    "the distributions of quiescent and star - forming drgs on @xmath111 color are obviously different , quiescent drgs have much redder @xmath111 colors than star - forming drgs , which attributes to the sed features of old stellar populations in quiescent drgs .",
    "69% drgs can be selected as ero , which represents the low redshift range of drg population .",
    "many drgs especially sdrgs distribute at higher redshift are missed by the ero selection .    secondly , we follow the procedure of @xcite to perform @xmath117 color calibration and correct the @xmath0 band accounting for @xmath118 described in @xcite , to see how drgs satisfy the bzk criteria . figure 14 ( b ) shows the distribution of drgs on the @xmath119 vs. @xmath120 plane .",
    "star - forming drgs are slightly bluer than quiescent drgs on @xmath117 color , but are obviously bluer on @xmath121 color .",
    "60.4% drgs could be selected as sbzks , 17.7% drgs could be selected as pbzks .",
    "other drgs mainly distribute in the redshift range of @xmath122 , most ( 73% ) of which are eros .",
    "thirdly , we analyze the overlap between drgs and ieros color criterion which is introduced by @xcite .",
    "the purpose of iero method is designed for selecting massive galaxies with mature stellar populations at @xmath7 based on 4000  balmer break shifting beyond @xmath6-band or steep slope of the rest - frame uv spectra of galaxies .",
    "thus , a simple color cut @xmath6[3.6 ] is designed to select high redshift galaxies .",
    "young and blue galaxies can not reach this threshold even at higher redshifts @xcite .",
    "based on the simulation performed by continuous star formation ( csf ) models in bc03 code , we obtain @xmath123 to calibrate @xmath6-band .",
    "as shown in figure 14 ( c ) , distributions on [ 3.6][4.5 ] color of two population of drgs are almost the same",

    "there are 72% quiescent drgs and 39% star - forming drgs could be selected as iero .",
    "quiescent drgs are more likely to be selected as iero , the iero color criterion rules out a large proportion of star - forming drgs , most of which are low - mass star - forming galaxies at low redshifts .",
    "lastly , we perform comparison between drg and high-@xmath6 ulirg color criteria introduced by @xcite . this irac color selection method is designed for selecting massive , star - forming dominated ulirgs at @xmath7 based on the 1.6 @xmath20 m stellar emission bump feature in galaxy seds . in @xmath124 , the four irac bands probe the rest - frame nir bands where galaxy seds have similar shape , thus the irac colors are robust in determining redshift in this range @xcite .",
    "the color criterion is set as @xmath125-[4.5]<0.4 $ ] and @xmath126-[8.0]<0.5 $ ] based on the m82 sed model @xcite .",

    "2009 , 49.2% drgs can be selected by this rectangle region , which reflects this selection method is efficient in determining redshifts . however , there are only 1.3% of drgs satisfy their third cut , f@xmath127 mjy , which is correspond to 17.15 mag in ab , as shown in the insert panel of figure 14 ( d ) .",
    "figure 15 shows the redshift distributions of drgs , and the subsample of drg satisfying other color criteria .",

    ", we can get a clear point of view in different color selection criteria : methods designed for selecting galaxies at @xmath7 have many overlaps between each other .",
    "the drg population is not a special galaxy group , the redshift distribution of them is broad , and most of them can also be selected by other color criterion .",
    "in this paper , we have described the construction of a large drg sample in the cosmos / ultravista field .",
    "based on multi - band photometry data , we analyze the physical properties of drgs .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows .",
    "we select a sample of 4485 drgs with @xmath1 and @xmath223.4 mag , and identify 3725 star - forming drgs and 760 quiescent drgs based on rest - frame uvj colors .",
    "we find the redshift distributions of drgs are broad , ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 with a mean value of 1.79 , but most of them ( 95.5% ) distribute at @xmath73 .",
    "the stellar masses of drgs mainly distribute at @xmath130 .",
    "drgs represent 70% of all galaxies in higher - mass bins at @xmath11 , indicating that the drg selection criterion is sensitive to select massive galaxies at high redshift .",
    "we study the morphological properties of drgs in our sample , employing data from @xmath55 wfc3/f125w and f160w imaging within the cosmos field . for drgs distribute at @xmath62 and @xmath64 , we measure gini and @xmath85 from f125w and f160w images , respectively .",
    "the morphological results are consistent with our rest - frame uvj color classification : quiescent drgs are generally compact and star - forming drgs tend to have extended structures , implying that these galaxies have experienced different formation processes .",
    "the sfr and @xmath4 of star - forming drgs present good `` main sequence '' relations in all redshift bins .",
    "moreover , the ssfr of drgs increase with redshift in all stellar mass bins and drgs with higher stellar masses generally have lower ssfrs , which indicates that galaxies were much more active on average in the past , and star formation contributes more to the mass growth of low - mass galaxies than to high - mass galaxies , owning to massive galaxies formed most of their stars earlier and rapidly slow down than their low - mass counterparts .",
    "this result is in agreement with the  downsizing \" scenario .",
    "there exists a trend in the sfr@xmath40/sfr@xmath96 vs. @xmath4 diagram of all galaxies : high - mass galaxies tend to have higher sfr@xmath40/sfr@xmath96 ratios , indicating that massive galaxies tend to contain more dust , thus the extinction for uv lights are heavier than low - mass galaxies .",
    "we find drgs occupy the high - mass and high ratio of sfr@xmath40/sfr@xmath96 region , which suggests the @xmath3 color criterion effectively selects the massive dusty sources whose sfr@xmath40 are dominant , and it is suitable for drgs using [ 3.6][24 ] color to trace their ssfrs . the fraction of qgs and the fraction of sfgs with @xmath100 selected by drg criterion as a function of redshift indicate that the red @xmath3 colors are mainly caused by dust reddening for sfgs and the balmer or 4000  breaks shifting into the @xmath12-band at @xmath11 for qgs .",
    "the @xmath5 color strongly correlates @xmath4 of drgs in all redshift bins .",
    "massive drgs have redder @xmath5 colors and the @xmath5 colors of drgs become bluer at higher redshifts , suggesting high - mass galaxies have larger internal dust extinctions or older stellar ages and they evolve with time .",
    "we also find that the irregular drgs dominate the reddest @xmath5 color and high - mass end at high - redshifts , but gradually turn bluer and less massive than disk and spheroid drgs toward low - redshifts . at @xmath110 , there are many blue spheroid drgs .",
    "they are in the stage of compact star - forming galaxies which are supposed to be the progenitors of compact qgs at high redshift .",
    "these findings may indicate a possible evolution scenario that massive disk - like drgs merge with each other frequently , then through violent relaxation and angular momentum loss , they finally become spheroid - like galaxies .",
    "we study the overlaps between drgs and eros , bzks , ieros , high-@xmath6 ulirgs , find drgs in our sample can be selected by other color criteria also .",
    "69% drgs can be selected as eros , and most of them have low redshift .",

    "<S> we present a study on physical properties for a large distant red galaxy ( drg ) sample , using the @xmath0-selected multi - band photometry catalog of the cosmos / ultravista field and the candels nir data . </S>",
    "<S> our sample includes 4485 drgs with @xmath1 and @xmath223.4 mag , and 132 drgs have hst / wfc3 morphological measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the results of nonparametric measurements of drg morphology are consistent with our rest - frame uvj color classification : quiescent drgs are generally compact while star - forming drgs tend to have extended structures . </S>",
    "<S> we find the star formation rate ( sfr ) and the stellar mass of star - forming drgs present tight `` main sequence '' relations in all redshift bins . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the specific sfr ( ssfr ) of drgs increase with redshift in all stellar mass bins and drgs with higher stellar masses generally have lower ssfrs , which indicates that galaxies were much more active on average in the past , and star formation contributes more to the mass growth of low - mass galaxies than to high - mass galaxies . the infrared ( ir ) derived sfr dominate the total sfr of drgs which occupy the high - mass range , implying that the @xmath3 color criterion effectively selects massive and dusty galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> drgs with higher @xmath4 generally have redder @xmath5 colors , and the @xmath5 colors of drgs become bluer at higher redshifts , suggesting high - mass galaxies have higher internal dust extinctions or older stellar ages and they evolve with time . finally , we find that drgs have different overlaps with eros , bzks , ieros and high-@xmath6 ulirgs indicating drgs is not a special population and they can also be selected by other color criteria . </S>"
