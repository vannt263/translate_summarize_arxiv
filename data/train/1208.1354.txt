    "the effects of possible gate voltages that might bias the superconducting islands of an artificial atom are taken into account by introducing offset charges @xmath158 ( in units of @xmath159 ) and substituting @xmath160 ( possible gate capacitances are assumed to be absorbed in @xmath161 and @xmath162 ) . with these substitutions ,",

    "the @xmath178 are found to be real and can be numerically calculated .",
    "in general , the @xmath179 have diagonal elements in our choice of basis .",
    "however , for the most common types of charge - based artificial atoms , cpbs and transmons , @xmath180 takes on the form of @xmath181 for @xmath139 , which is insightful to consider before returning to the general case .",
    "cpbs are characterized by @xmath182 .",

    "that is , in the case of cpbs , the transition frequencies @xmath173 are simply given by @xmath167 and flux - tunable .",
    "the qubit - qubit coupling @xmath197 depends only on the capacitances of the system and is independent of @xmath134 and the qubit transition frequencies ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "thus , the normalized transverse field @xmath104 ( for @xmath199 ) is strictly linear in @xmath16 .    for transmons - qubits @xcite , which are characterized by @xmath200 , ( i ) expanding the @xmath201 terms in @xmath166 of eq .",
    "and ( ii ) dropping the boundary condition @xmath202 on the eigenfunctions of @xmath166 provides a good approximation @xcite .",
    "note that due to ( ii ) , the effect of the offset charges @xmath168 is completely suppressed since the @xmath203 and the biased number operators @xmath179 are equivalent canonical variables , @xmath204 = [ \\varphi_j , \\hat{n}_{j}]= i$ ] .",
    "this is justified as the dependence of the qubit properties on the offset charges is exponentially suppressed with increasing ratio @xmath205 @xcite ( in reality , gate voltages do not have to be applied to transmons ) .",

    "we substitute eq .   and the above expression for @xmath218 into eq .   and",

    "dropping constants and all terms @xmath222 with @xmath223 , and rotating the coordinate system counter - clockwise by @xmath191 around the @xmath224-axis leads to @xmath225 this transmon approximation of eq .   also has the form of @xmath3 for @xmath139 .",
    "we remark that in @xmath226th order perturbation theory , where the transmons are harmonic oscillators , the terms in parentheses in @xmath219 are equal to @xmath149 . however , the term @xmath227 , stemming from the product of the @xmath179 operators , is present .",
    "the @xmath226th order result corresponds to the hamiltonian derived in @xcite for their system of coupled transmons .",

    "they are flux - tunable via @xmath229 ( rather than @xmath230 as for cpbs ) . for transmons ,",
    "the qubit - qubit coupling is given by @xmath231 .",
    "importantly , this @xmath12 depends also on external fluxes via @xmath232 ( and on the transition frequencies via @xmath233 ) .",
    "since the physical properties of a uniform tfic are essentially determined by the normalized transverse field @xmath29 ( the absolute values of @xmath16 and @xmath12 only set the dynamical time scales ) , we use our perturbative results to study the tunability of @xmath234 for identical transmons .",
    "we insert our first - order results for @xmath16 and @xmath12 into @xmath38 and expand @xmath235 $ ] , where we have set @xmath236 . the overall factor",
    "@xmath208 comes from the nominator of @xmath12 and is not due to the nonlinear perturbation of the system as argued above .",

    "flux - tunability of @xmath38 is a second - order effect , via @xmath239 . to roughly estimate the strength of this effect",
    ", we consider the contribution of the first - order approximations of @xmath16 and @xmath12 to it .",
    "note that the second - order approximations of @xmath16 and @xmath12 actually also contribute to the leading flux - dependent term ( @xmath240 ) of @xmath38 .",
    "if one requires the transmons to remain in their optimal working regime @xmath241 @xcite , this contribution leads to a tunability @xmath242 .",
    "thus , one may expect that strongly tuning @xmath38 by changing the flux bias will require to leave the optimal transmon working regime , and possibly even to go beyond the validity regime of eq .  .",
    "therefore , we now come back to the general case of eq .  .",
    "before doing so , we remark that @xmath243 .",
    "this indicates that the ferromagnetic phase ( @xmath26 ) can not be reached with transmons .",
    "it turns out that at the charge degeneracy point @xmath244 , the biased charge operator @xmath245 has only off - diagonal elements in the basis chosen in eq .  .",
    "consequently , @xmath180 has the form of @xmath3 ( at @xmath139 ) for all ratios @xmath205 .",
    "this enables us to interpolate between the charge - degenerate cpb case and the transmon case ( where the @xmath168 become irrelevant ) : assuming identical qubits , we vary the ratio @xmath246 at @xmath247 .",
    "we numerically calculate @xmath248 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath16 as functions of @xmath249 .",
    "then we plot @xmath12 vs.@xmath16 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : s2](a ) ] and @xmath38 vs.  @xmath16 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : s2](b ) ]",
    ". additionally , we plot the approximate results that we have gained analytically for cpbs and transmons . to obtain @xmath12 as a function of @xmath16 from our analytical results for transmons , we employ our approximation for @xmath12 to first order in @xmath208 . in this approximation ,",
    "we replace @xmath250 , making use of the first order approximation for @xmath16 .",
    "the plots show that for @xmath251 , the qubit - qubit coupling @xmath12 becomes proportional to @xmath16 , and the normalized transverse field @xmath38 ceases to be flux - tunable . for quenching @xmath38 by changing the flux bias",
    "one therefore has to engineer @xmath252 . in this regime ,",
    "the artificial atoms start to loose their insensitivity to charge noise , which is a distinguishing property of transmons .",
    "for instance , at @xmath253 , @xmath254/ \\overline{\\omega(n_b ) } \\approx 3\\%$ ] . here , @xmath255 denotes the mean qubit transition frequency , averaged over all possible bias charges @xmath256 .",
    "however , the characteristic features of the quench dynamics of our circuit qed quantum simulator occur on short timescales ( see main text ) , so that one should get along with the reduced dephasing times of charge qubits in this regime ( compared to usual transmons ) . for example , an energy relaxation time @xmath257 of @xmath258 and a dephasing time @xmath259 of @xmath260 have been reported even for a cpb ( at the charge degeneracy point ) @xcite .",
    "we remark that , depending on the charge bias @xmath256 , @xmath16 can be equal to the energy difference between second and first excited state of the artificial atom , @xmath261 , which would invalidate the two - level approximation for the artificial atoms .",
    "for instance , if @xmath262 as considered here , this happens at @xmath263 @xcite .",
    "however , the difference of these transitions crosses zero very steeply as a function of @xmath249 @xcite .",
    "thus , the two - level approximation for the artificial atoms is justified as long as start or end point of the quench are not too close to this value .",
    "we finally remark that working with tunable coupling capacitances @xcite might provide an alternative to working with transmons out of their optimal parameter range .",
    "this would allow one to tune @xmath38 via tuning @xmath264 .     and",
    "( b ) normalized transverse field @xmath29 vs.  qubit transition frequency @xmath16 for two identical charge qubits operated at the charge degeneracy point . the system is characterized by the charging energy @xmath265 and the flux - tunable total josephson energy @xmath266 of a qubit , and by the capacitive coupling energy @xmath264 . the ratio @xmath249 fully determines a point on each axis ( i.e. , the quantities @xmath267 , @xmath268 , and @xmath269 ) .",
    "the dots correspond to the integer values @xmath270 of @xmath249 .",

    "having written the lagrangian of such a system in terms of the classical variables @xmath142 and @xmath273 @xcite , one finds that the canonical charge variables @xmath143 are given by @xmath274 . here",
    ", we have defined @xmath275 , @xmath276 , and @xmath277 and we have assumed that the artificial atoms are identical , @xmath278 and @xmath279 .",
    "inverting @xmath280 yields @xmath281 . with that , one obtains the hamiltonian @xmath282 of the system , which is then quantized as usual @xcite .",
    "to first order in @xmath283 , @xmath284 the same steps as for @xmath139 now lead to a straightforward generalization of eq .  , where artificial atoms with hamiltonian @xmath166 are coupled to their nearest neighbours via @xmath285 [ for @xmath139 , eq .",
    "equals the first order expansion of @xmath180 above eq . ] .",
    "to first order in @xmath283 , the only difference for @xmath286 is that the effective charging energies of the artificial atoms in the bulk of the chain ( @xmath287 ) are slightly reduced compared to those at the surface ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "this is because the bulk artificial atoms couple to two neighbours .",
    "in reality , this surface inhomogeneity should be negligible already because the capacitance of the surface artificial atoms is also increased by their coupling to other parts of the circuit .",
    "therefore , to first order in @xmath283 , our derivation of the hamiltonian @xmath3 of the tfic from the circuit theory of two artificial atoms also holds for larger chains , only with a slightly renormalized @xmath265 .",
    "the same is true for our corresponding deliberations on the dependence of @xmath16 , @xmath12 , and @xmath38 on the fundamental circuit quantities .",
    "we remark that taking into account terms of order @xmath288 introduces coupling terms @xmath289 in eq .",
    "( and , for @xmath290 , renormalizes also the nearest neighbour coupling energies @xmath264 compared to the case @xmath139 ) . hence",
    ", the integrability - breaking longer - range coupling decays exponentially with distance @xmath291 in our system and is therefore neglected in this work .",
    "we finally remark that nonperturbative numerical calculations strongly suggest that also the renormalized values of @xmath265 and @xmath264 for @xmath292 do not allow one to achieve @xmath293 .",
    "this means that the ferromagnetic phase can not be reached with transmons in the limit of large @xmath249 [ cf .",
