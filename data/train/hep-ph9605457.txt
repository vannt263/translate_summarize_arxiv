    "the test run ( 10000 unweighted parton level events at lep2 energies ) takes approximately 420 cpu seconds on an aging 486dx2/66 pc running linux 2-@xmath3 . on contemporary personal computers",
    ", the 42  ms / event will be reduced to 5  ms / event and work stations will need less than 1  ms / event . the cpu time per event increases mildly with the beam energy .",
    "the spectacular success of the high energy electron positron colliders lep at cern and slc at slac has confirmed the predictions of the standard model ( sm ) for the interactions between the gauge bosons and the fermions even at the level of electroweak radiative corrections .",
    "the high precision of the experimental data allows to put limits on parameters of yet unobserved particles like the higgs boson through the appearance of these particles in weak loop corrections . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - abelian structure of the gauge sector of the sm predicts couplings between the electroweak gauge bosons which have not been tested directly . the forthcoming upgrade of lep  @xcite to lep2  @xcite with a center of mass energy of up to @xmath4  gev and a future 0.51.5  tev @xmath2 linear collider  @xcite ( nlc , for short ) will in particular make the trilinear @xmath5 and @xmath6 couplings directly observable through their contribution to the production of @xmath0 pairs .",
    "the main task of lep2 will be a precise determination of the mass and the width of the @xmath0 and the production cross section in the threshold region  @xcite . at nlc ,",
    "a measurement of the total cross section , the @xmath0 angular distributions and in particular of their longitudinal polarization component will give a handle on possible anomalous couplings among the electroweak bosons induced by new physics beyond the sm @xcite , and in turn reveal an insight into the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "however , possible new physics is already severely constrained by present lep and slc data , and the effects to be expected at nlc ( even more so at lep2 ) are small . in order to extract these small effects",
    ", one has to have a precise knowledge of the radiative corrections within the sm .",
    "the electroweak radiative corrections to the production of on - shell @xmath0 s to one - loop order are by now well established @xcite .",
    "the influence of the finite width of the @xmath0 s has been investigated in  @xcite .",
    "also , the higher order qed corrections have been calculated in the leading log approximation ( lla ) and their importance has been emphasized in ref .",
    "an exhaustive overview of the standard model predictions has been provided in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental reconstruction of the @xmath0 s and the determination of their polarization is complicated by the fact that they may decay either into leptons with an escaping neutrino , or into hadrons , where the jet energies may be poorly known due to undetected particles . in addition , the radiative corrections due to emission of photons produce a systematic shift of the effective center of mass energy towards smaller values .",
    "such effects may best be studied with the help of a monte carlo event generator .",
    "although quite a few semianalytical calculations of the corrections mentioned above have been available for some time , version 1.0 of / @xcite had been the first publicly available and complete monte carlo event generator . in the meantime , many new programs have been released @xcite .",
    "this paper describes version / of the monte carlo event generator /.",
    "it is based on the lowest order cross section for the process @xmath7f and focusses on qed radiative corrections in the lla resummed to all orders in @xmath8 and the effects of finite width of the @xmath0 s .",
    "the four - momenta of the exclusive hard photons are generated explicitly and treated with full kinematics .",
    "the @xmath0 decays into fermions are implemented at the parton level , including leading qcd corrections to the @xmath0 branching fractions .",
    "this write - up is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : general ] we outline the physics underlying the algorithms implemented in /.",
    "the actual implementation is described in section  [ sec : prog - struct ] .",
    "the parameters controlling the execution of / are discussed in detail in section  [ sec : parameters ] and the 77/ interface is presented in section  [ sec : f77 ] .",
    "distribution notes , a listing of all external symbols and the output of a test run can be found in the appendices .",
    "in the structure function formalism @xcite the expression for the radiatively corrected cross section reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the born level cross section of the hard process , @xmath11 are the structure functions for initial state radiation , and @xmath12 is the factorization scale .    the structure functions @xmath13 sum the numerically most important leading logarithmic contributions @xmath14 to the electromagnetic radiative corrections to all orders .",
    "they satisfy the qed evolution equation  @xcite @xmath15_+                   d\\left(\\frac{x}{z},q^2\\right ) \\\\ \\label{eq : splitting - function }    p_{ee}(z ) & = & \\frac{1+z^2}{1-z}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with initial condition @xmath16 the solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dglap ] ) automatically includes the very important exponentiation of the soft photon contributions to the radiative corrections .",
    "an explicitly regularized version of ( [ eq : dglap ] ) used in the monte carlo implementation is given by @xmath17                    d(x , q^2 ) . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is crucial to note that the characteristics of the generated event sample do not depend on  @xmath3 , if it is chosen well below the experimental threshold for the detection of soft photons .",
    "theoretically , the cross sections will remain positive for _ all _ values of @xmath3 , but limited storage for ultra soft photons and limited floating point range impose a lower limit .",
    "the radiatively corrected cross section ( [ eq : factorization ] ) is implemented in a monte carlo event generator by solving the integro - differential equation  ( [ eq : regularized - dglap ] ) by iteration and taking into account the energy loss in the hard cross section .",
    "it is very similar to algorithms for quark fragmentation in qcd  @xcite . as a by - product of the branching algorithm , the four - momenta of the radiated photons are generated explicitly .",
    "the initial state branching algorithm has already been used in the monte carlo generator ` kronos ` @xcite and an improved version in the generator ` unibab ` @xcite , where the implementation has been described in detail .",
    "the momenta of the electron and positron after initial state branching are then used as the input momenta for the subgenerator of the hard subprocess described below .      in the general case ,",
    "there are many feynman diagrams contributing to the process @xmath18 4  fermions at high energies , even if one requires that the quantum numbers of the final state fermions be consistent with @xmath0 pair production @xcite .",
    "however , the contribution of the individual feynman diagrams may be easily estimated by counting the number of resonant propagators , where an intermediate vector boson may come close to its mass shell . using this naive estimate",
    ", one finds that the contribution of these ` background diagrams ' is suppressed by a factor @xmath192.5% for each non - resonant boson propagator , and may be reduced further by appropriate cuts on the invariant masses of the reconstructed @xmath0 s .",
    "in fact , a full calculation  @xcite finds that this estimate is numerically justified for lep2 energies , unless electrons are in the final state and no invariant mass cuts are applied .    in the current version / of / , we have taken into account the doubly and singly resonant feynman diagrams shown in figures  [ fig : cc03-diagrams ] and  [ fig : cc11-diagrams ] , also known as the `` cc11 '' diagrams @xcite .",
    "note that the combination of the fermions 1 and 2 has quantum numbers consistent with a @xmath20 , while the combination of the fermions 3 and 4 has quantum numbers consistent with a @xmath21 , even for the singly resonant diagrams .",
    "we will refer to these pairs as `` pseudo-@xmath0 s '' below .",

    "it can easily be seen that , after integrating the modulus squared of the born amplitudes over the decay angles of the pseudo @xmath0 s , one obtains the same resonance formula for the total cross section for production of the pseudo @xmath0 pairs as in the well known doubly renonant case @xcite , for each combination of final state fermions @xmath24 : @xmath25 here @xmath26 denotes the off - shell cross section for the production of two pseudo-@xmath0 s , and @xmath27 is the effective decay width of a virtual @xmath0 into light fermions according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) .",
    "the resonance factors are breit - wigner functions with energy - dependent width : @xmath28 note that equation ( [ eq : resonance - formula - partial ] ) also holds for the total cross section , after summation of over the decay channels of the pseudo  @xmath0 s : @xmath29    for the actual implementation it is useful to apply the mappings ( @xmath30 ) @xmath31 to eq .",

    "these seven operators exhaust all possible lorentz structures when we neglect the scalar components of the vector bosons , @xmath39 which is allowed if we couple the bosons to ( almost ) massless external fermions .    in accordance with hagiwara et al .",

    "the translation formulae are presented in section  [ sec : ac ] below .",
    "another class of universal corrections , which is important near threshold , is the so - called coulomb singularity .",
    "we implement the correction  @xcite @xmath47 to the off shell total cross section ( [ eq : resonance - formula - total ] ) .",
    "stricly speaking , this correction should only be applied to the subset of doubly resonant diagrams . however , the coulomb correction is only large for the @xmath0 s close to their mass shell where the singly resonant diagrams are suppressed , and thus we apply it as a universal correction factor .      in the case of the doubly resonant diagrams ,",
    "the relative probabilities of the final state fermions are simply given by the branching fractions of the @xmath0 s .",
    "this remains true even after taking into account the inclusive qcd corrections to the @xmath0 decays to quarks to first order in @xmath48 , because of the factorization of the amplitude into @xmath0 production and decay .",
    "neglecting fermion masses , one has : @xmath49 however , in the case of the inclusion of the singly and doubly resonant diagrams , it is not clear how to take the qcd corrections into account , since no full calculation is as yet available .",
    "neglecting qcd corrections to final states with quarks is clearly unacceptable , and simply multiplying the contribution of the doubly resonant diagrams with the qcd correction factor spoils the gauge cancellations between singly and doubly resonant diagrams .",
    "therefore , we have taken the approach to implement the qcd corrections in ( [ eq : resonance - formula - partial ] ) by using an `` effective number of colors '' @xmath50 which we refer to as the `` naive qcd corrections '' .",
    "the final state fermions of the decay @xmath51 are therefore chosen with a probability according to the cross sections obtained from ( [ eq : resonance - formula - partial ] ) , with the naive qcd corrections applied as described above .",
    "the branching fractions for hadronic decays into  @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and  @xmath56  quarks are given by the corresponding ckm matrix elements , while decays into  @xmath57  quarks are assumed to be kinematically forbidden because of  @xmath58 .",
    "currently , the fermion masses are only taken into account kinematically and not in the matrix elements .",
    "the angular distributions of the pseudo @xmath0 s and of the decay fermions is generated by a standard mapping and rejection algorithm from the differential cross section @xmath59 and from the modulus squared matrix element , respectively .",
    "if one or both of the @xmath0 s have decayed into quarks , they can optionally be hadronized using either the lund string model  @xcite , the herwig cluster model  @xcite or the ariadne  @xcite color dipole model . in the present version",
    "it is not possible to study color - rearrangement effects in purely hadronic decays .",
    "both @xmath0  decays are handled separately .",
    "the hadronization model can be switched at run time with the parameter qcdmc , which takes the values 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "these correspond to no parton level , ` jetset `  @xcite , ` herwig `  @xcite and ariadne  @xcite respectively .",
    "like almost all monte carlo event generators , / is divided into three parts : initialization , event generation , and termination .",
    "these are described in this section .",
    "for ease of use , / comes with two application interfaces , so that a direct call to the lower level parts in this section will never be necessary .",
    "these interfaces will be explained in section  [ sec : f77 ] .",
    "the initializations in / are used for computing the value of variables that will be used frequently during event generation .",
    "examples are the calculation of electroweak couplings , the maximum of the off - shell born cross section and other internal steering parameters from the input parameters .",
    "this is accomplished by a call to the subroutine wwinit after setting the monte carlo parameters .",
    "since / does not yet include weak corrections , most of the initializations performed are quite trivial .    finally , a standard / initialization record @xcite is written , which may be used by the analysis program .",
    "the routine wwgen produces an event on every call .",
    "the four momenta of all generated particles as well as supplemental information is written to a standard / event record , where it can be read by user supplied analyzers .",
    "see section  [ sec : hepevt ] below for details on / s extensive use of /.",
    "the first step is the generation of the initial state radiation by the branching routine wwbini using the algorithm of section  [ sec : formalism ] and of the virtual masses of the pseudo @xmath0 s occurring in the intermediate state . according to the cross section ( [ eq : resonance - formula - mapped ] )",
    ", the rejection weight is calculated from the ratio of the actual off - shell cross section to the maximum determined in the initialization step , and the event is accepted with a probability according to this weight .",
    "after the effective center of mass energy and the pseudo @xmath0 masses have been fixed , the quantum numbers of the event ( helicity of incoming fermions and type of final state particles ) are determined with probabilities proportional to their relative cross sections . the angular distribution and four - momenta of the pseudo @xmath0 s",
    "are generated in wwgww and wwgppr , respectively .",
    "finally , the decay of the intermediate @xmath0 s into the final state fermions is accomplished in the subroutine wwgdec .",
    "the cross section for the generated events is obtained in the subroutine wwclos from the standard formula @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the off - shell cross section from eq .",
