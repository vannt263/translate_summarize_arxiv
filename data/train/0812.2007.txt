    "a significant effort was made , over a number of years , to find the origin of gamma  ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "the discovery of optical afterglows in long  duration grbs allowed for the determination of the grb s redshift ( for a review , see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "this led to the realization that long  duration grbs are at cosmological distances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper , long  duration",
    ", cosmological grbs will be referred to simply as grbs .",
    "the light curve of the optical afterglow of grb  980326 showed a rebrightening at around two weeks after the burst @xcite .",
    "this rebrightening , or bump , in the light curve was attributed to an underlying supernova ( sn ) .",
    "this was the first observational indication of an association between grbs and sne .",
    "during april of 1998 , an unusual gamma  ray burst , grb  980425 , was discovered with its gamma  ray energy several orders of magnitude lower than typical grbs @xcite .",
    "optical observations of the region led to the discovery of an unusual supernova , sn  1998bw , within the error radius of the grb @xcite .",
    "spectra of sn  1998bw showed it to be a type  ic sn with exceptionally broad lines ( ic  bl ) .",
    "this sn was also unusually bright for a type  ic sn @xcite .",
    "it was thought that grb  980425 might simply be a normal grb , but one where the jet was viewed off axis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , according to late ",
    "time radio observations @xcite , even if it was viewed off  axis it would still be an unusual grb",
    ". there may be more dim , peculiar grbs , like grb  980425 , than observations would indicate ; due to the fact that those at large redshifts are difficult to detect .",
    "the afterglow spectra of grb  030329 were remarkably similar to that of sn  1998bw @xcite .",
    "the sn associated with this grb was then named sn  2003dh . from this , it was clear that at least some long  duration gamma ",
    "ray bursts are connected to supernovae . since then , two other sne  ic  bl have been spectroscopically confirmed to have a grb connection : sn  2003lw / grb  031203 @xcite and sn  2006aj / grb  060218 @xcite . not all sne  ic  bl have a convincing grb connection ; as is the case for sn  1997ef @xcite and sn  2002ap @xcite .",
    "however , this does not rule out the possibility of an association with a weak ( possibly off  axis ) grb .",
    "it also seems that there are some long  duration gamma ",
    "ray bursts with no apparent associated supernova ; such as grbs 060505 and 060614 @xcite .",
    "similar to the bump found in the optical afterglow light curve of grb  980326 ( mentioned above ) , there have been several other grb afterglow light curves with just such a bump ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this provides us with a number of possible grb / sne to consider , even without spectroscopic confirmation .",
    "these light curves are typically analyzed using a composite model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , discussed below in section  5 .",
    "most of the light curves considered here are of this type . for alternative explanations for this rebrightening see @xcite and references therein . for a discussion on the possible progenitors of long  duration grbs , see @xcite .",
    "the observed data are discussed in section  2 .",
    "section  3 covers the analysis of the light curves while the results are presented in section  4 .",
    "the conclusions are discussed in section  5 .",
    "the photometry data were collected from the literature .",
    "band data were used for most of the grbs due to their relatively high redshifts .",
    "band data were used for grb  980425 ( @xmath0 ) and grb  060218 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the photometry references are given in table  1 .",
    "distances and extinctions were taken into account in order to convert the apparent magnitudes to absolute magnitudes .",
    "luminosity distances were calculated from the redshifts using the following cosmology : h@xmath2 @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the distance modulus , @xmath6 , for each grb was calculated and is given in table  1 along with the references .",
    "foreground galactic extinction was taken into account according to @xcite .",
    "these values were taken from ned and converted from a@xmath7 to a@xmath8 .",
    "for host galaxy extinction , the best estimates from the literature were used . in the case where the host galaxy extinction was estimated to be small or negligible ( yet still unknown )",
    ", a value of 0.05 mag was assigned .",
    "the extinctions are listed in table  1 , along with their references .",
    "spectra of sn  1998bw were used to calculate k  corrections .",
    "the spectra used were from @xcite and obtained from the suspect databasesuspect/ ] .",
    "three of the light curves used in this study had no significant grb afterglow component at the time of the sn : grb  980425/sn  1998bw , grb  031203/sn  2003lw and grb  060218/sn  2006aj .",
    "one of the light curves ( grb  030329/sn  2003dh ) had no noticeable sn bump ; that is to say that the sn component was masked by a slowly declining afterglow .",
    "however , spectroscopy revealed a significant sn contribution @xcite .",
    "most of the light curves had both a sn bump and a significant grb afterglow component at the time of the sn . in order to analyze the sn by itself , the grb afterglow component ( and sometimes the host galaxy contribution ) needed to be removed .",
    "if the light curve still included light from the host galaxy , and yet there was not sufficient late  time data to determine the host galaxy contribution , then that grb was not included in the study .",
    "this was the case for grb  991208 .",
    "once the host galaxy light had been accounted for , there were still two components .",
    "the grb and the sn were treated independent of each other . while there is certainly some interaction between the grb and the sn , treating them as independent is a reasonable first order approximation .",
    "the early  time data , in the resulting light curve , were used to determine the contribution of the grb afterglow .",
    "after day one , or day two , this was usually an unbroken power law .",
    "it appears as a straight line on a graph of r vs.log(t ) , as shown in figure  1 .",
    "the only exception is grb  030329 , where the grb afterglow contribution was determined solely from the spectra . for all other grbs ,",
    "there needed to be sufficient early ",
    "time data to determine the grb afterglow contribution .",
    "if this contribution could not sufficiently be determined from the data , then that grb was not used in this study .",
    "this was the case for grb  010921 and grb  000911 .",
    "there were , however , a few exceptions ( grbs 020305 , 020410 and 020903 ) . the two dimmest sne in the study are from the light curves of grb  020305 and grb  020410 .",
    "if the actual grb contribution was larger than estimated for these sne ( shallower slope ) , then the sn contribution would be smaller making these sne even dimmer than reported here . even if the grb contribution was negligible ( steeper slope , including a downward break ) , then these two sne would be brighter than reported here , but would still be the two dimmest sne in the study .",
    "the light curve of grb  020903 was not sufficient to get a good estimate of the grb contribution .",
    "however , it was sufficient to reasonably determine that the grb afterglow had a negligible contribution at the time of the sn s peak brightness .",
    "these three sne are included because their peak absolute magnitudes are still relevant , even if the other information obtained from the light curve fitting remains highly uncertain ( see table  2 ) . in general , the uncertainty in determining the grb afterglow contribution is difficult to quantify and has not been included in the peak absolute ",
    "magnitude uncertainties given in table  2 .",
    "a sn light  curve model was used to help obtain accurate peak absolute magnitudes from the resulting light curves .",
    "it was also used in determining estimates of the kinetic energy , ejected mass and nickel mass for each sn .",
    "the model used here is a semi  analytical model derived from two already existing models ; @xcite and @xcite . at early times , the arnett model is used ; where the diffusion approximation is valid . at late times , the deposition of gamma ",
    "rays dominates the light curve , and the jeffery model accounts for this .",
    "the basic assumptions are spherical symmetry ; homologous expansion ; radiation pressure dominance at early times ; that @xmath9ni exists and has a distribution that is somewhat peaked toward the center of the ejected matter .",
    "also , optical opacity is assumed to be constant at early times and gamma - ray opacity is assumed to be constant at late times .",
    "the combined model is described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the model uses the sn s kinetic energy , ejected mass and nickel mass as parameters . after searching a grid of parameter values , a least",
    " squares best fit was used to determine the most likely parameter values for each light curve . in order to improve the results ,",
    "the ratio of kinetic energy to ejected mass was constrained .",
    "sn spectra were used to determine this ratio ; however , spectra exist for only four of the grb / sne in the study .",
    "these ratios are given in foe m@xmath10 , where 1 foe @xmath11 erg .",
    "the values are 5.0 for sn  1998bw @xcite , 4.8 for sn  2003dh @xcite , 4.6 for sn  2003lw @xcite and 1.0 for sn  2006aj @xcite .",
    "the average of these four values , 3.8 , was used for the other grb / sne for which spectra were not available .",
    "possible consequences of this approximation are discussed below ( section  4.2 ) .",
    "the peak absolute magnitudes are listed in table  2 .",
    "the uncertainties shown were obtained by taking into account the uncertainties for each of the values in table  1 , as well as the observational uncertainties in the apparent magnitudes .",
    "figure  2 shows a histogram of the absolute  magnitude distribution .",
    "this distribution has an average of m@xmath12 and a standard deviation of @xmath13 . also shown in this figure is the distribution of stripped ",
    "envelope sne , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  2 ) .",
    "envelope sne ( se sne ) are a combination of sne ib , ic and iib ; and those shown here , do not have a grb association . the main difference between these two distributions",
    "is that the grb / sne are , on average , brighter by 0.8 magnitudes .",
    "this is likely due to a selection effect . in order for most of the grb / sne to be detected",
    ", they have to be relatively bright compared to their grb afterglow .",
    "otherwise , it must be close enough to obtain a spectrum ; as was the case with grb  030329 .",
    "therefore , any relatively distant sn connected with a grb that has a bright , or slowly declining , afterglow will not be detected ; especially if the sn is relatively dim .",
    "this is why the dim grb / sne are likely to be undercounted .",
    "notice that the two dim grb / sne fit well within the se sn distribution .    a graph of peak absolute magnitude versus distance modulus is shown in figure  3 .",
    "the two diagonal dashed lines represent the apparent magnitudes of 16 and 25 .",
    "the horizontal dashed line represents the type  ia ridge line , and is shown for comparison .",
    "the grb / sne can be compared to se  sne @xcite , included in this graph .",
    "nearly all of the grb / sne were found to have an apparent magnitude dimmer than 16 , but with a limiting magnitude of 25 .",
    "this is in contrast to the se sne which were nearly all found to have an apparent magnitude brighter than 16 .",
    "since this is related to distance , we see that it is rare to find any nearby grb / sne .",
    "distant grb / sne are discovered because their associated grbs are extremely bright .",
    "about half of the grb / sne in figure  3 are near the type  ia ridge line .",
    "the dimmest sn in the study , from grb  020305 , has a very large uncertainty .",
    "it is still worth including , however , due to the fact that it is firmly at the low end of the distribution even with the large uncertainty .",
    "when compared to other studies , the absolute magnitudes given here are , on average , somewhat brighter ( after accounting for different cosmologies ) .",
    "for example , see table  5 from @xcite and figure  6 ( which is similar to figure  3 of this paper ) from @xcite",
    ". this difference could possibly be due to the different methods for extracting the peak absolute magnitudes .",
    "the light curves are presented in figure  4 .",
    "most of these light curves have a good range over time , considering the difficulty in separating the sn contribution from that of the grb afterglow ( early times ) and host galaxy ( late times ) .",
    "the best estimates for kinetic energy , ejected mass and nickel mass are given in table  2 , along with rise times . because spectra exists for only four of these grb / sne , e@xmath14m@xmath15 values are only known for these four .",
    "the average value is used for the others .",
    "this is a reasonable first order estimate ; however , a change in this value affects the individual e@xmath16 and m@xmath15 values determined by the model .",
    "the trend is that increasing the e@xmath14m@xmath15 ratio leads to an increase in both the e@xmath16 and m@xmath15 values obtained in the best model fits .",
    "this does not significantly affect the m@xmath17 values and therefore does not affect m@xmath18 .",
    "also notice , from table  2 , that m@xmath18 and e@xmath16 are not correlated .",
    "this was the case for se  sne as well @xcite .",
    "note that in the light  curve model , it is assumed that a substantial amount of @xmath9ni is synthesized in the explosion .",
    "the decay of this isotope powers the peak of the light curve .",
    "then , @xmath9co ( which is a product of the @xmath9ni decay ) itself decays and powers the tail of the light curve .",
    "the best fit model light curves are all shown on the same graph in figure  5 , with a common time of explosion .",
    "this shows , as expected , a general trend that the brighter sne have broader light curves .",
    "this , however , is not always the case .",
    "grb  030723 is very narrow compared to grb  970228 , yet they have similar peak magnitudes .",
    "the average peak absolute magnitude was found to be higher for the grb / sne than for the se sne .",
    "however , in view of possible selection effects , the difference may not be significant .",
    "there were two grb / sne at the dim end of the distribution , but well within the distribution of se sne .",
    "most of the sn data analyzed here were taken from grb afterglow light curves .",
    "the grb light was treated as being independent of the sn light and was removed so that the resulting light curve could be analyzed as a sn light curve .",
    "these resulting light curves fit quite well with a sn light curve model ( figure  4 ) .",
    "grb afterglow light curves that are suspected of having a sn component are usually analyzed by a different method .",
    "usually the observed data are fit to a composite model , where all of the components are represented ; grb , sn and host galaxy ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "the assumptions made are similar to those made with the separation method of this paper .",
    "the main difference between the two methods is in the way the sn is treated .",
    "the composite method starts with a light curve of sn  1998bw ( adjusted for the grbs redshift ) .",
    "two of the five free parameters in the composite model are then used in the overall fit to describe the sn ; one for the brightness and one for the width of the sn contribution .",
    "while the separation method uses sn  1998bw for k  corrections , a general se sn model is then fit to the resulting light curve .",
    "the two methods are similar ; however , the separation method used here allows for closer analysis of the the sn .",
    "reasonable estimates of the kinetic energy , ejected mass , nickel mass and rise times are found .",
    "however , the values of kinetic energy and ejected mass from other studies @xcite tend to be larger by a factor of approximately two .",
    "the coincidence of the grb date and the derived date of the sn explosion is another point of interest . in all but two cases",
    "the difference between the two dates was less than a week .",
    "for grb  050525a , the sn explosion date is estimated to have occurred about 10 days before the grb date , but by looking at the model fit and the observed data in figure  4 , we see that the model was not able to simultaneously reproduce the narrow peak and the bright , late  time data point .",
    "it appears that a more accurate explosion date for the sn would bring it closer to the grb date . for grb  011121 , the sn explosion date is estimated to have occurred about 9 days before the grb date .",
    "other studies have given similar results @xcite , but the lack of pre  peak data for this sn makes the sn explosion date difficult to accurately pin down . thus there is no clear evidence for real differences between the times of the grbs and the sne .",
    "the nickel masses determined here range from 0.05 to 0.99 m@xmath19 .",
    "these are similar to the values found for se sne with no grb association @xcite .",
    "however , the kinetic energy values determined here range from about one to 31 foe and the ejected mass values range from about one to six m@xmath19 .",
    "these values are , on average , considerably higher than those found for se sne with no grb association .",
