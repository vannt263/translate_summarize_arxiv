    "fig.[co_bh ] presents the spectra .",
    "s106 shows a clear double - peaked profile at the bandhead .",
    "the interpretations of the spectral shape of the bandhead have been provided by several authors @xcite .",
    "figure2 in the paper by @xcite is instructive to explain the spectral features of a disc model .",
    "the emission of a single line from an inclined keplerian rotating disc is described with the double - horned rotational broadening function .",
    "the model bandhead is then simply the convolution of this broadening function with the intrinsic co emission .",
    "this leads to a distinct `` blue shoulder '' of the bandhead where there is blue shifted emission relative to the line of sight , which sets a constraint on both the line width and the inclination of the source .",
    "this is clearly seen in s106 .",
    "it should be noted that a double - peaked feature can also be reproduced with a wind model @xcite , when the opening angle of the conical wind is so small that the observer sees the red component only from the far side and the blue component only from the front side .",
    "this is not the case in s106 because this object is seen near to edge - on @xcite .",
    "the spectral features of v645  cyg can also be explained with the same models .",
    "the emission peak is located around 2.293  @xmath13 m , which is between the blue shoulder and red peak in s106 and where the difference of the system velocities is negligible . in the face - on case ,",
    "the rotational broadening function is single - peaked , and the peak stays at the bandhead wavelength . in this object ,",
    "only the blueshifted components are detected in the and outflow emissions @xcite .",
    "this result indicates that the system is seen near face - on and the redshifted part is obscured by the equatorial material , presumably an accretion disc .",
    "a single - peak is also reproduced in a wind model if the opening angle of the wind is large .",
    "however we would then expect the peak of the emission to be shifted redwards compared to the nominal @xmath14 of the source and it clearly is not .    for i18151 , the data , although noisy , show no significant emission bluewards of the peak of the bandhead that can not be explained by simple line broadening .",
    "the inclination angle of i18151 is estimated to be @xmath15 @xcite , intermediate between the cases of s106 and v645  cyg , and the appearance of the spectrum is consistent with this if the origin of the emission is a disc .",

    "* ) , and the einstein coefficients are taken from @xcite . the co@xmath19h@xmath3 ratio is assumed to be @xmath20 .",
    "for the disc geometry , we use a temperature gradient model , @xmath21 , and a geometrically thin disc with a surface density @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the distance from the central star .",
    "the disc has inner and outer radii of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , and is tilted with an inclination angle , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 indicates face - on .",
    "the co molecules are assumed to have a keplerian rotating motion @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the gravitational constant and the stellar mass , respectively .",
    "the disc is divided into 75 radial rings each with 75 azimuthal cells .",
    "the intrinsic line shape of each transition has a gaussian function with a line width of @xmath31 .",
    "the total spectra are obtained by summing the flux from individual cells , in which the wavelength shift due to the rotational velocity of the disc is taken into account .",
    "the outer radius is set by the condition that the gas phase temperature drops below 1000  k , at which point the @xmath8 emission is no longer excited .",
    "in addition , the c - o bonding is dissociated at temperature above 5000  k. hence , the maximum temperature is chosen not to exceed 5000  k. with these physical assumptions the co bandhead spectra are produced and compared to the observed spectra using an idl script .",
    "the best fit model parameters are found using @xmath32 minimization .",
    "we examine the three objects with co emission , i18151 , s106 and v645  cyg .",

    "it turned out that the @xmath33 and @xmath34 parameters have particularly large uncertainties .",
    "hence , we set fixed values of @xmath37 , respectively , which are derived for intermediate mass stars @xcite .",
    "the results of other six parameters are presented in table[tab : cobh ] . only @xmath26 and @xmath35 are estimated with good accuracy .",
    "a similar analysis was done for s106 by @xcite . although the estimated inclination angle they used of @xmath38 is somewhat different from ours , their estimate of the size of the co emitting region of 0.8 to 1.5  au is in reasonable agreement . in both s106 and v645  cyg ,",
    "the best fitting inclination angle is consistent with the qualitative expectations discussed previously , as well as available results from the literature as given in appendix [ discussion ] , suggesting that our estimated stellar masses are also reasonable .",
    "d10 analysed the low j absorption line velocity structure of co @xmath8 .",
    "their data show a pair of blueshifted and redshifted components at east and west with respect to the flux peak position in the @xmath1-band continuum in w33a .",
    "they found the classical signature of a keplerian rotating structure in the position - velocity ( pv ) diagram and a central mass of 15  @xmath11 , which includes the masses of the central star and the hot gas inside the cool gas region .",
    "both i18151 and afgl  2136 show absorption features in the low @xmath9 transition of co @xmath8 . from the cube data",
    ", we used 11 absorption lines , which appear between 2.32  @xmath13 m and 2.35  @xmath13 m @xcite .",
    "we first derived the wavelength positions of individual absorption features , which are regarded as the zero - velocity .",
    "the images of all branches are aligned with the relative velocity and are added to increase the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "then , the differential images between the redshifted ( @xmath39 ) and blueshifted ( @xmath40 ) components , i.e.the subtraction of the blueshifted component image from the redshifted component images , the images of the velocity centroids , and the pv diagrams are made .",
    "the top and bottom panels of fig.[co_vc ] show the results of i18151 and afgl  2136 , respectively .",
    "the velocities range between @xmath41  kms@xmath5 for i18151 and @xmath42  kms@xmath5 for afgl  2136 .",
    "although the standard deviations in velocity are large , we can clearly see a pair of redshifted and blueshifted components in the @xmath43 images ( left panels ) .",
    "the separations and the position angles of these components are obtained by measuring the absorption centroids of the blueshifted and redshifted components to be 0.038  arcsec at @xmath44 for i18151 and 0.054  arcsec at @xmath45 for afgl  2136 with typical errors of one tenth of a pixel on the centroid and 5@xmath46 on the angle . applying a slit along these position angles ,",
    "the pv diagrams are made ( right panels ) and the velocity centroid at each position pixel ( 0.043  arcsec spacing ) is plotted with pink dots , with a typical error on the velocity of better than one tenth of a resolution element , or kms@xmath5 .",
    "the redshifted component is located on the right side of the panel . in the velocity centroid maps , we see a skew , which is often seen in objects with keplerian rotation , though the correspondence with a keplerian model is not perfect even given the estimated errors . if we assume that this is also the case in our results , we can estimate the central masses .",
    "for this purpose , we made a simple model .",
    "the keplerian rotating velocity of the co gas , @xmath47 , is calculated by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the central mass .",
    "the inclination angles , @xmath26 , and the distances to these objects are assumed to be @xmath15 and 2.0  kpc for i18151 @xcite and @xmath50 and 2.0  kpc for afgl  2136 @xcite . to allow direct comparison with the observations ,",
    "the resulting velocity curve is obtained by convolving gaussian functions with the psf sizes ( 0.1  arcsec ) . in the pv diagram ,",
    "the modeled velocity curves are plotted with green lines .",
    "the observed and model data are sufficiently similar to conclude that we do see keplerian rotation in the cool absorbing gas in these sources .",
    "the resultant central masses are 30  @xmath11 for i18151 and 20  @xmath11 for afgl  2136 , with error of approximately 10% assuming the keplerian model is a good fit .",
    "the central mass of 30  @xmath11 for i18151 is larger than that of the inferred mass for a b0 star of @xmath51 that was used in modelling the co bandhead emission .",
    "however , the absorbing gas includes the mass of not only the central star but also all the gas located inside the maximum extent of the region of absorbing gas .",
    "although the error on these measurements is large enough to suggest both absorption and emission kinematical masses could be equivalent , it may also suggest a larger reservoir of material still available for accretion by the central star . the large 220@xmath11 mass found for the `` disc - like '' structure by @xcite",
    "is certainly consistent with the picture in which more accretion could take place .",
    "a similar situation was found by d10 for w33a as well .",
    "the orientation of the redshifted and blueshifted components in the co @xmath8 absorption line is nearly northeast - southwest in i18151 , perpendicular to the larger scale outflow .",
    "this is notably different from both the ionised spectroastrometric signature seen for br@xmath2 , and the small scale north - south h@xmath3 jet we see in our data .",
    "it is possible that the outflow is precessing with time , though no intermediate angles are seen in the h@xmath3 jet by d04 .",
    "it is also possible that the jet initially launches in a north - south direction , but is deflected by the larger scale molecular envelope in the observed southeast - northwest direction . in either case",
    ", the structure of the accreting gas in the immediate vicinity of the star appears to lie at different orientations when moving further away from the star .",
    "m on velocity scale . , width=321 ]    the orientation of the co absorption in afgl  2136 is also puzzling .",
    "the blue- and red - shifted components of the absorption centroid lie at a position angle of @xmath52 with a separation of @xmath53100  au . as noted in appendix [ discussion ] , the observed outflow axis runs se  nw , consistent with the polarisation disc with a position angle of @xmath5345@xmath46 found by @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the distribution of mass on a few thousand au is different from that on hundreds  au , i.e. a simple axisymmetric structure may not be applicable in this object , just as appears to be the case for i18151 . nevertheless , by assuming a keplerian rotating motion in the cold co gas",
    ", the velocity structure can be reproduced well with a 20  @xmath11 mass model .",
    "although the stellar parameters of afgl  2136 have not been precisely determined , it corresponds to a late o zero - age main sequence star in terms of the estimated luminosity of 5.3@xmath5410@xmath55 , corresponding to a @xmath56 star .      in our sample ,",
    "the @xmath57 ( @xmath58 m ) line is detected in i19065 , s106 , and v645  cyg , and the @xmath59 ( @xmath60 m ) blend is present as a weak absorption feature in s106 .",
    "figure[hei ] presents the line profile on a @xmath14 scale for the @xmath57 in all three objects .",
    "we see emission in i19065 and absorption in s106 and v645  cyg . notably the emission feature seen in i19065 is broader than expected from unresolved emission from the ionised hii region , suggesting that this , like the br@xmath2 emission , arises from the star in this source .",
    "@xcite have obtained @xmath1-band spectra of be stars , and @xcite and @xcite of a more general sample of ob stars of all classes .",
    "the trends with spectral type are relatively clear and can be used to classify the emission as seen in our targets .",
    "hei @xmath57 appears in emission in later type stars in dwarfs , giants and supergiants , and in many of the b0ve and b1ve stars in @xcite , and in oe stars with types as early as o6ve in @xcite .",
    "the lack of any detectable @xmath59 line in i19065 however suggests a relatively narrow range of type of around b0ve or b1ve , which is consistent with the known luminosity of this source from the rms survey @xcite .",
    "@xcite previously detected the @xmath57 line in s106 , mostly in absorption as we also see it .",
    "they argue that this absorption probably arises due to high optical depth in the 584   line and a high electron density ( @xmath61  @xmath62 ) .",
    "the fwhm is 65  kms@xmath5 and is in good agreement with the result of 70  kms@xmath5 by @xcite .",
    "this velocity width is significantly smaller than that of the br@xmath2 emission lines ( @xmath53100  200  kms@xmath5 ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that this line traces the region where the outflow from a disc - wind is still accelerating .",
    "weak hei @xmath59 absorption is seen , but there is no niii 87 emission at @xmath63 m emission as would be seen in earlier spectral types @xcite .",
    "this suggests a type of o9ve  b0ve .",
    "we also carried out a spectroastrometric study of the @xmath57 line given its strength .",
    "overall there is only a weak signature near the systemic velocity , in the direction of the bipolar nebula , perhaps consistent with a slight degree of infilling of the absorption line profile by larger scale nebular emission .",
    "our lower resolution spectroscopy taken for the rms survey @xcite shows nebular hei @xmath57 emission consistent with this .",
    "the spectroastrometry does not show evidence for any other feature .",
    "in particular , there is nothing similar to the disc like structure seen in fig.[bg_spcast ] .    in v645",
    "cyg , the absorption feature is strongly blueshifted and appears around @xmath64@xmath6  kms@xmath5 .",
    "a similar trend is seen in the spectrum presented by @xcite . however , the spectral feature spreads up to @xmath65  kms@xmath5 in their data , but is detected only up to @xmath66  kms@xmath5 in our spectrum .",
    "v645  cyg changes its spectral appearance regularly , complicating any attempts to derive an exact spectral type .",
    "however , the spectra we have is consistent with approximately o9ve , similar to s106 .",
    "the star can not be hotter , given the lack of niii , and the lack of any hei @xmath59 suggests it can not be much cooler either .",
    "the other metal lines that we see in our spectra , such as nai , mgii or feii are less sensitive to the spectral type . in all three cases",
    "it is plausible that the emission actually comes from the accretion disc rather than the stellar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "overall the hei and other metal lines suggest a common picture in which a stellar wind or disc wind can be present , along with an accretion disc",
    ". it would be interesting to determine whether spectroastrometry could be used on some of these metal lines in future higher signal - to - noise studies to test whether this scenario is correct .",

    ", we successfully detected a bipolar jet like feature in the br@xmath2 emission line and a keplerian rotating motion of the neutral co gas disc around a @xmath5315  @xmath11 mass central star in w33a . in this new work",
    ", we increase the sample , with four out of six being already well studied and two new .",
    "our new data display a number of spectral lines such as br@xmath2 emission lines , co bandhead emissions and absorptions , h@xmath3 @xmath67 s(1 ) , s(2 ) , and .",
    "some clear features can be inferred from our data despite the heterogeneous nature of the sample .",
    "all of our targets show evidence of br@xmath2 emission .",
    "the measured @xmath68 ranges between 100 and 200  kms@xmath5 , which is consistent with stellar wind or disc - wind velocities @xcite . in v645",
    "cyg , the p - cygni profile is detected in a velocity range between @xmath6  kms@xmath5 and @xmath7  kms@xmath5 .",
    "this is consistent with a spherical wind . in the br@xmath2 emission images ,",
    "the appearance is similar to those of the @xmath1-band continuum images in all objects , suggesting that these features are seen in scattering by dust in the circumstellar disc or envelope .",
    "there is a clear spectroastrometric signature in both s106 and i18151 , running perpendicular to the known larger scale outflow axis in both cases . at least for s106 ,",
    "the orientation is consistent with the disc - wind picture previously developed for this source , and we conclude the same should be true for i18151 as well .",
    "this is the opposite of what d10 saw in w33a , where the best explanation for the spectroastrometric signature was an ionised bipolar jet . in the two cases presented here",
    "it would suggest that the signature arises in ionised gas in , or from , a disc around the star . in the case of the well",
    "studied s106 , the orientation of our spectroastrometric disc is also consistent with the morphology of the radio emission observed by @xcite .",
    "the presence of a stellar wind in this object is clear from the strong hei absorption , lending support to the disc - wind picture of @xcite .",
    "the estimates that are derived for the stellar masses from the spectroastrometry assuming keplerian orbits , although clearly imprecise due to the scatter in the data as shown in fig.[bg_spcast ] , and strictly lower limits , are consistent with the known properties of these sources .",
    "the evidence that these two sources contain discs is therefore strong .",
    "the other objects show spectroastrometric data consistent with a null result in most cases , revealing only a random - walk like pattern , though afgl  2136 may show evidence for a weak hii region near the systemic velocity .",
    "i19065 shows a larger scatter in its random - walk pattern than the other non - detections .",
    "this may be due to `` contamination '' of the stellar spectrum due to the extended nebular hii region emission .",
    "the lack of any signature in v645  cyg , given the excellent signal - to - noise for that source , places a strong constraint on what we see there , consistent with the p - cygni wind profile observed in the line .",
    "evidence for a disc from co bandhead emission was present in i18151 , s106 and v645  cyg .",
    "the disc parameters for i18151 and s106 are consistent with those found from our analysis of the spectroastrometry of br@xmath2 .",
    "the edge - on nature of s106 is clearly seen in these data as well .",
    "v645  cyg shows evidence for a more pole - on orientation , which may be why we see no evidence for a disc - wind component in this source in the spectroastrometry . it may also simply be that v645  cyg is relatively more evolved than the other sources .    finally , in i18151 and afgl  2136",
    ", a series of co absorption lines are detected .",
    "if we assume that these lines originate from the co gas disc and the velocity structures reflect the keplerian rotating motion , the central masses can be estimated .",
    "our data show a separation of the flux centroids between the blueshifted and redshifted components .",
    "this orientation is nearly perpendicular to the jet direction in i18151 , giving a strong evidence for a rotating motion in our data , whereas that orientation is less correlated with the direction of the outflow or the nir polarization disc in afgl  2136 .",
    "nevertheless , the rotation velocities and the central masses are estimated to be @xmath69  kms@xmath5 and 30  @xmath11 for i18151 and @xmath70  kms@xmath5 20  @xmath11 for afgl  2136 .",

    "recently , @xcite assessed the effective temperature from the optical spectroscopy .",
    "they suggest that @xmath85 is about 25000  k , but that the star is probably extended .",
    "given the variability in the spectrum , it is not inconceivable that this result is in agreement with the earlier result of @xcite , who found a temperature nearer 30000k , and a type near o9ve as we do here ( which is also more consistent with the known luminosity ) .",

    "a similar profile is detected in w33a ( d10 ) .",
    "our spectroastrometry of br@xmath2 shows no significant signal .",
    "we suggest that this is due to the fact that br@xmath2 arises in a spherically outflowing wind in this source , which essentially has a null spectroastrometric signature .",
    "this also naturally explains the strong p - cygni profile .",
    "we previously concluded that w33a has an asymmetric wind by comparison .",
