    "phase transitions occur between different macroscopic states of many - particle systems when control parameters such as temperature , pressure , magnetic field , chemical composition , _",
    "etc_. are varied .",
    "phase transitions occurring at nonzero temperatures are called _ thermal or classical _ transitions .",
    "they are driven by thermal fluctuations .",
    "another type of transitions , the so - called _ quantum _ phase transitions occur at absolute zero temperature , when a nonthermal external parameter is changed @xcite .",
    "they are driven by quantum rather than thermal fluctuations .",
    "the study of observable quantities at quantum phase transitions is an important subject of modern condensed matter theory .",
    "since materials often feature considerable amounts of quenched disorder , the study of phase transitions in the presence of imperfections or randomness has received much attention .",
    "initially , it was thought that any kind of disorder can destroy sharp phase transitions because ( in the presence of disorder ) the system divides itself up into regions which can undergo the transition at different values of the control parameter .",
    "later , it became clear that phase transitions are generically sharp in the presence of weak disorder .",
    "however , under special conditions , rare finite - size spatial regions can indeed undergo the phase transition independently , leading to a smearing of the transition .",
    "this happens , for example , at quantum phase transitions with overdamped order parameter dynamics @xcite or at thermal phase transitions with extended defects @xcite .",
    "theories of disordered systems often assume the randomness to be uncorrelated in space even though real systems contain some amount of disorder correlations . at critical points , this assumption is justified as long as the correlations are not too long - ranged .",
    "this can be understood , e.g. , by looking at the harris criterion @xcite for the stability of a clean critical point against weak disorder .",
    "harris divided up the system into regions whose linear size is the correlation length @xmath0 .",
    "the variation of the local critical temperatures from region to region can be estimated using central limit theorem , yielding @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the space dimension .",
    "harris observed that the critical behavior of the clean transition can be unchanged if the fluctuations @xmath3 between the regions are smaller than the global distance @xmath4 from criticality , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath5 . because @xmath6 , this leads to the inequality @xmath7 for @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the correlation length critical exponent of the clean system .",
    "thus , for stability of the clean critical behavior we must have @xmath10 .",
    "this inequality is called the harris criterion .",
    "weinrib _ et al . , _ @xcite generalized the harris criterion to long - range correlated disorder .",
    "they considered power - law correlations , @xmath11_{\\rm{av}}\\sim |{\\bf{x}}-{\\bf{y}}|^{-\\alpha}$ ] , where @xmath12_{\\rm{av}}$ ] is the disorder average . to estimate fluctuations between correlation volumes @xmath13 ,",
    "the central limit theorem estimate has to be replaced by    @xmath14    for @xmath15 , we find @xmath16 .",
    "then , the stability criterion for clean critical behavior takes the form @xmath17 for @xmath18 or @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "thus , for @xmath18 , the original short - range harris criterion is recovered .",
    "however , for @xmath20 , long - range correlations lead to a new inequality .",
    "thus , as long as the correlations decay faster than @xmath21 with distance , correlated and uncorrelated disorder have the same effect on the stability of the clean critical behavior .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we studied the effects of spatially correlated disorder on _ smeared _ phase transitions , and we showed that even short - range correlations qualitatively modify the behavior of observable quantities . here , we summarize this theory .",
    "we then report the results of new computer simulations for which we have generated spatially correlated atom distributions using kawasaki monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "in this section , we summarize the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite for the behavior of observables in the tail of smeared phase transitions .",
    "we consider a material consisting of substances a and b. material a is in the magnetic phase characterized by a negative distance from criticality @xmath22 .",
    "material b is in the paramagnetic phase with @xmath23 .",
    "the quantum phase transition from a non - magnetic to a magnetic phase can be tuned by substituting magnetic atoms a for nonmagnetic atoms b in the binary alloy a@xmath24b@xmath25 .    due to statistical fluctuations in the atom distribution , there can be large ( rare ) spatial regions which show local order because they have a high local concentration of a atoms even if the bulk system is in the non - magnetic phase .",
    "if the order parameter fluctuations are overdamped , the quantum dynamics of these regions freezes .",
    "this leads to inhomogeneous magnetic order and a smearing of the phase transition @xcite .",
    "we now explore the effects of disorder correlations on smeared phase transitions within optimal fluctuation theory .",
    "assume that there are attractive short - range correlations between like atoms , with disorder correlation length @xmath26 .",
    "like atoms tend to form clusters of typical volume @xmath27 roughly , the transition point @xmath28 where the phase transition would happen without having any rare regions effects , can be found by setting the average distance from criticality to zero .",
    "this gives @xmath29 a rare region of linear size @xmath30 can show local static order if the local concentration of non - magnetic b atoms is smaller than some critical concentration @xmath31 which can be estimated from finite size scaling @xcite , @xmath32 . here , @xmath33 is a non - universal constant , and @xmath34 is the shift exponent which takes the value of @xmath35 within mean - field approximation .",
    "as the concentration @xmath36 must be positive , we obtain the condition @xmath37 for the minimum size of a locally ordered rare region .",
    "the probability @xmath38 for a rare region with @xmath39 sites to have @xmath40 sites occupied by b atoms is equal to the probability @xmath41 of finding @xmath42 b - clusters among @xmath43 clusters .",
    "it is given by the binomial distribution @xmath44 to calculate the total magnetization , we can simply integrate the binomial distribution ( [ bin ] ) over all rare regions showing local order . in the regime where the concentration @xmath45 is somewhat larger than @xmath28 , we find ( up to power - law prefactors ) @xmath46\\label{expo}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is a non - universal constant . in this regime ,",
    "the magnetization drops exponentially with @xmath45 , and spatial disorder correlations modify the prefactor in the exponent .    in the far tail of the smeared transition at @xmath48 , the composition dependence of the order parameter",
    "is given by a non - universal power law @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "for small disorder correlation length @xmath51 , earlier results for uncorrelated disorder @xcite are recovered , @xmath52 . in the limit of large correlation lengths",
    "@xmath53 , all clusters show local order , and all magnetic a atoms contribute to the magnetization .",
    "this leads to @xmath54 .",
    "thus , in the far tail , disorder correlations modify the exponent of the order parameter . in both regimes , for attractive correlations as considered here , the magnetization @xmath55 at a given concentration @xmath45 increases with increasing correlation length @xmath26 .",
    "to illustrate the theory we now show results of numerical simulations of a toy model .",
    "motivated by the quantum - classical mapping @xcite we consider a classical ising model with infinite - range interaction in one ( timelike ) dimension and short - range interaction in three spacelike dimensions .",
    "the hamiltonian has the form @xcite @xmath56 here , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are space coordinates , @xmath59 is the timelike coordinate .",
    "@xmath60 is the system size in the time direction .",
    "@xmath61 denotes pairs of nearest neighbors in space .",
    "@xmath62 is a binary - random variable , which takes values @xmath63 or @xmath64 depending on the type of atom on the given lattice site @xmath57 .",
    "the concentration of sites with @xmath63 and @xmath64 are @xmath45 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath62 at different lattice sites are not independent , but they are correlated .",
    "because the interaction is infinite - ranged in the timelike direction , this dimension can be treated within mean - field theory .",
    "this leads to coupled mean - field equations for the local magnetization at site @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a small symmetry - breaking field and the sum is over all nearest neighbors of site @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath69 is the inverse classical temperature ( not related to the physical temperature of the quantum system which is encoded in @xmath60 ) @xcite .",
    "the smeared phase transition can be tuned by changing the composition @xmath45 in the temperature range @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the phase transition temperatures for pure systems with all @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .    in order to generate",
    "correlated binary random variables we use a more realistic method than the one used in ref .",
