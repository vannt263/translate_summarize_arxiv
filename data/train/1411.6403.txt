    "in our preceding work @xcite we have analyzed the wannier - stark states ( ws - states ) in a tilted one - dimensional double - periodic lattice .",
    "it was shown that the spectrum of ws - states consists of two wannier - stark ladders that affect each other in a rather complicated way . in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite to double - periodic two - dimensional lattices or , more exactly , to two - dimensional lattices with two sublattices .",
    "the fundamental difference of 2d lattices as compared with 1d lattices is that the wannier - stark spectrum and ws - states depend not only on the strength of a static field @xmath0 but also on its orientation relative to the primary axes of the lattice , where one should distinguish between ` rational ' and ` irrational ' orientations .",
    "the former are given by an arbitrary superposition of the translation vectors and the latter comprise the remaining directions .",
    "for rational orientations ws - states are bloch - like states in the direction orthogonal to the vector @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "thus they can labeled by the ladder index @xmath2 and the transverse quasimomentum @xmath3 .",
    "correspondently , the energy spectrum of the system is a ladder of energy bands which are termed wannier - stark bands ( ws - bands ) in what follows .",
    "unlike this situation , for irrational orientations the spectrum is pure point and ws - states are localized states in any direction @xcite .    in the work we pay special attention to physical manifestations of the structure of the energy spectrum that can be detected in a laboratory experiment , where two most favorite candidates are wave - guide arrays @xcite and cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "in particular , continuous spectrum of the ws - states for rational orientations of the static field implies ballistic spreading of a localized wave packet .",
    "this effect can be easily observed for the light in a wave - guide array and , with some efforts aimed on improving resolution of the imaging system , also for cold atoms in an optical lattice .",
    "we analyze the rate of wave - packet spreading as the function of the static field magnitude and its orientation . the other quantity that can be measured in experiments with cold atoms",
    "is the total occupation of the bloch subbands which change in time because of the interband landau - zener tunneling ( lz - tunneling ) .",
    "we shall show that knowledge of the wannier - stark spectrum suffices to predict different regimes of the interband dynamics .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we introduce the model  the tight - binding hamilltonian of a square 2d lattice with two sublattices  and perform preliminary numerical analysis of the wannier - stark spectrum .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we obtain asymptotic expressions for ws - bands in the limits of strong and weak static field .",
    "these results are used in the subsequent sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , which compares the rate of ballistic spreading calculated on the basis of ws - bands with that observed in numerical simulations of the wave - packet dynamics , and in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , which discusses landau - zener transitions between the bloch subbands .",
    "the main results of the work are summarized in the concluding sec .",
    "as the model we shall consider a square lattice of the unit period with two different tunneling elements along the bonds and different on - site energies for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 sites , see fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "notice that the primary axes of this lattice are rotated by 45 degrees with respect to the @xmath6 axes and the new period is @xmath7 .",
    "the bloch spectrum of this lattice consists of two subbands with the dispersion relations @xmath8 found as eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the bloch wave quasimomenta .",
    "two particular cases to be addressed in this work , are ( i ) @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; and ( ii ) @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in the former case two",
    "bloch bands are separated by a finite energy gap , see fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , while in the latter case they touch each other at the dirac points , see fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "it appears that the absence or presence of dirac s cones in the bloch spectrum strongly affects the wannier - stark spectrum and , hence , this two cases should be analyzed separately .",
    "let us now proceed to the tilted lattices . as it was already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] , the fundamental difference of tilted 2d lattices as compared with tilted 1d lattices is that the wannier - stark spectrum and ws - states depend on the field orientation , which we shall characterized by the parameter @xmath16 .",
    "alternatively , one can characterize the field orientation by the parameter @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are field components in the coordinate system aligned with the primary axes of the lattice .",
    "then rational orientations corresponds to rational values of the parameter @xmath20 which also implies rational @xmath21 ( here @xmath22 and @xmath23 are co - prime numbers ) .    to find the energy spectrum for rational @xmath21 we follow ref.@xcite and rotate the coordinate system to align the new @xmath24-axis with the vector @xmath1 , and then use the plane - wave ansatz for the wave function .",
    "this results in the following eigenvalue problem @xmath25 where @xmath26 one obtains the ws - bands through a sweep along the plane - wave quasimomentum @xmath3 which enters eq .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) as a parameter . as an example fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows these bands for the parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "[ in the original coordinate system this orientation corresponds to @xmath29 . ]",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that ws - bands appear in pairs and are arranged into two ladders with the step @xmath30 .",
    "as @xmath0 is varied the bands change their shape in a rather complicated way . on the other hand ,",
    "if we fix the quasimomentum @xmath3 , we obtain wannier - stark fan , see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , which resembles that for a 1d double - periodic lattice .",
    "in particular , it is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that energy levels of different symmetry show avoided crossing when they approach each other .",
    "if we now fix @xmath0 and vary @xmath3 these avoided crossings become avoided crossings between energy bands .",
    "we would like to draw reader s attention that the discussed avoided crossings are much more pronounced in the case ( ii )  we come back to this point in sec .",
    "[ sec3c ] .    in the next section",
    "we shall analyze ws - bands in more details , focusing on their dependence on the static field @xmath0 .",
    "along with explicit form of the energy bands we shall be also interested in the following integrated characteristic , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the the group velocity .",
    "it will be shown later on in sec.[sec4 ] that the quantity ( [ b9 ] ) determines the rate of ballistic spreading of a localized wave packet .",
    "for the purpose of future references fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows this quantity as the function of @xmath33 .",
    "the limit of strong fields can be solved using rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory with @xmath34 as the small parameter . as follows from eq .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) , the zero - order spectrum corresponds to flat bands arranged into two ladders . denoting by @xmath35 the perturbation correction , we have @xmath36 the super - index @xmath37 in the correction term underlines its dependence on the field orientation .",
    "it can be rigorously proved that few first terms in the perturbation series vanish and , hence , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is number of vanishings terms .",
    "for example , for the lattice ( i ) we have @xmath40 if @xmath29 , @xmath41 if @xmath42 , etc .. thus , in general case the band width @xmath43 of the ws - bands tends to zero if @xmath44 .",
    "two exclusions , where the bands have a finite width in the above limit ( i.e. , @xmath45 ) , correspond to situations where @xmath1 is aligned with the @xmath46 or @xmath24 axis .",
    "it should be mentioned that the increment @xmath39 depends not only on the field orientation but also on the lattice geometry and for the lattice ( ii ) we have @xmath45 if @xmath1 is parallel to the @xmath46 axis yet @xmath40 if @xmath1 is parallel to the @xmath24 axis .",
    "it can be also shown that the first non - vanishing term of rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory gives the cosine dispersion relation for the ws - bands : @xmath47 note that the dispersion relation @xmath35 is periodic function of @xmath3 with the period @xmath48 but not @xmath49 , as one might naively expect basing on the explicit periodicity of the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) .",
    "finally , we mention that the functional dependence of the quantity ( [ b9 ] ) on @xmath0 is obviously given by @xmath50 , see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "the region of applicability of the perturbation approach of sec .",
    "[ sec3a ] is restricted to small values of the parameter @xmath34 , smaller than the position of the first peak in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . in this subsection",
    "we discuss a more sophisticated approach which allows us consider moderate @xmath0 , where the band width @xmath43 of ws - bands takes its maximal value .",
    "this approach is a straightforward generalization of the method used in ref .",
    "@xcite to analyze the wannier - stark spectrum of a quantum particle in one - dimensional lattices .    similar to eq .",
    "( 5 ) in ref .  @xcite we introduce the generating functions @xmath51 this reduces eq .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) to the system of two ordinary differential equations , @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 equation ( [ b6 ] ) falls into the class of linear dynamical system and can be viewed as some effective two - level system driven by a three - chromatic field .    to solve eq .",
    "( [ b6 ] ) one can apply a variety of methods of which the bogoliubov - mitropolskii averaging technique proves to be the most universal @xcite . for the lattice ( ii )",
    "this techique was used in our recent paper @xcite , from which we borrow the final result . restricting ourselves by one itteration , correction to the flat energy bands",

    "using the fact that @xmath59 for @xmath60 it is easy to prove that in the limit @xmath44 eq .  ( [ c1 ] ) recovers eq .",
    "( [ b4b ] ) .",
    "however , unlike in rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory , eq .  ( [ c1 ] ) captures oscillatory behavior of the band width @xmath61 , as well as the presence of higher harmonics in the dispersion relation . for example",

    "( [ c3 ] ) with the exact numerical results we found that for the parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] it correctly approximates ws - bands till @xmath64 , where the quantity @xmath4 has the first minima .",
    "the opposite limit of small @xmath0 is more involved in the sense that the result depends on the presence of dirac s points in the bloch spectrum .",
    "first we shall discuss the lattice",
    "( i ) where the bloch bands are separated by the gap equal or larger than @xmath65 .",
    "a finite gap insures vanishing interband lz - tunneling in the limit @xmath66 .",
    "thus the spectrum of 2d ws - states can be found by using the adiabatic theorem , in full analogy with the weak field case for 1d lattices @xcite . denoting by @xmath67 and @xmath68 the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath69 matrix ( [ b7 ] ) for @xmath70",
    ", the energy spectrum of ws - states is given by the equation @xmath71 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath72 are the dynamical and geometrical phases , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ c6 ] ) contains the transverse quasimomentum @xmath3 as a parameter .",
    "in fact , one can related this quasimomentum and the constants ( [ c7 ] ) to the bloch spectrum @xmath73 of the system . to do this",
    "we rotate the axis in the quasimomentum space to align the new @xmath74 axis with the vector @xmath1 of the static field .",
    "then the transverse quasimomentum @xmath3 is associated with @xmath75 and the constant @xmath76 coinside in the limit @xmath66 with the mean energy of the bloch subbands along the line parallel to @xmath1 : @xmath77    let us discuss the dispersion relation ( [ c8 ] ) in some more details .",
    "the left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows this dispersion relation for three different orientations of the static field : @xmath28 , @xmath78 , and @xmath62 .",
    "it is seen that @xmath35 rapidly converges to a flat band when @xmath22 and @xmath23 are increased .",
    "more elaborated numerical analysis shows that this convergence is exponentially fast , see riht panel infig .",
    "thus , for most of the field orientations the band width @xmath43 takes an exponentially small value in the limit @xmath66 .      as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , for the lattice ( i ) the quantity ( [ b9 ] ) , which characterizes the width of ws - bands , takes a constant value as @xmath0 is decreased .",
    "obviously , this is a manifestation of transition to the adiabatic regime of interband lz - tunneling .",
    "this result , however , does not hold for the lattice ( ii ) where the bloch subbands are connected at the dirac points . in this situation",
    "we have non - negligible lz - tunneling for arbitrary small @xmath0 and arbitrary field orientations @xcite .",
    "correspondently , the function @xmath79 does not take a constant value in the limit of small @xmath0 .    to study the interband lz - tunneling we consider a delocalized initial condition given by a bloch wave .",
    "for this initial condition the problem reduces to solving the schrdinger equation @xmath80 where @xmath81 is obtained from the hamiltonian ( [ b1 ] ) by substituting @xmath82 .",
    "notice that the solution depends on the initial quasimomenta .",
    "thus , at any given time populations of the bloch sub - bands are functions of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath83 .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows snapshots of @xmath84 for the lattice ( ii ) where initially only the lower band was populated  a setup corresponding to fermi particles with the fermi energy at @xmath70 @xcite .",

    "this explans qualitative difference between the lattice ( i ) and ( ii ) in the weak field limit .",
    "the continuous spectrum of ws - states implies ballistic spreading of a localized wave packet where , asymptotically , the second moment of the packet grows quadratically in time : @xmath87 for the lattice ( i ) this behavior is illustrated in fig .",

    "the packet continues to spread in the direction orthogonal to the vector @xmath1 , while for irrational orientations dispersion @xmath100 saturates at some level .",
    "considering the dispersion as the function of field orientation @xmath101 , we observe development of a fractal structure where each peak is associated with some rational @xmath16 ( see fig .  [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in sec .  [ sec1 ] , cold atoms in optical lattices offers a possibility for measuring populations of the bloch subbands . in this section",
    "we discuss population dynamics and relate it to the energy spectrum of ws - states .",
    "we shall consider two different initial conditions : bloch wave with zero quasimomenum ( i.e. , the ground state of the system ) and equal occupation of all quasimomentum states belonging to the lower subband .",
    "these initial conditions are realized in experiments with noninteracting bose and fermi atoms , respectively . on the formal level",
    "the latter case implies analysis of the population dynamics for arbitrary initial quasimomentum , followed by averaging over the brillouin zone .    the thin solid lines in fig .",

    "( [ c9 ] )  is periodic function of time for rational @xmath16 and quasiperodic function for irrational @xmath20 .",
    "thus for rational @xmath20 one has chance to observe periodic population dynamics similar to periodic stckelberg oscillations in one - dimensional lattices .",
    "remarkably , for the fermionic initial condition situation is inverted . because of continuous spectrum of ws - states for rational @xmath20 , the averaging over the brillouin zone leads to irreversible decay of oscillations , so that population of the upper band stabilizes at some level . on the contrary , for irrational @xmath20",
    "the spectrum of ws - states is discrete . as a consequence ,",

    "importantly , this spreading takes place only in the direction orthogonal to the vector @xmath1 .",
    "the underlying phenomenon behind this effect is the interband landau - zenner tunneling ( lz - tunneling ) between bloch subbands @xcite .",

    "can be summarized as follows . in the strong field limit",
    "the rate of ballistic spreading @xmath4 obeys universal law @xmath107 where the increment @xmath39 is an integer number uniquely determined by the lattice geometry and field orientation relative to the primary axes of the lattice . in the opposite weak field",
    "limit the rate @xmath4 also shows universal behavior , however , only in the case where the bloch spectrum of the system does not contain dirac points .",
    "if it is the case , @xmath4 becomes independent of @xmath0 and depends only on the lattice geometry and field orientation . in terms of lz - tunneling",
    "these two asymptotic regimes correspond to nearly diabatic and adiabatic interband dynamics . for intermediate @xmath0",
