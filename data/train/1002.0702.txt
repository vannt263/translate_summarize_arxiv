    "in this paper we deal with the problem of uniqueness of post - gelation solutions of several models of coagulation , namely smoluchowski s and flory s classical models , and the corresponding models with limited aggregations recently introduced by bertoin @xcite .",
    "smoluchowski s coagulation equations describe the evolution of the concentrations of particles in a system where particles can perform pairwise coalescence , see e.g. @xcite . in the original model of smoluchowski",
    "@xcite , a pair of particles of mass , respectively , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , coalesce at rate @xmath2 and produce a particle of mass @xmath3 . in the discrete setting ,",
    "the evolution of the concentration @xmath4 of particles of mass @xmath5 at time @xmath6 is given by the following system @xmath7    norris considered in @xcite far more general models of _ cluster coagulation _",
    ", where the rate of coalescence does not depend only on the mass of the particles but also on other parameters . in this general setting",
    ", most results on existence and uniqueness are obtained before a critical time , known as the _ gelation time _ , while the global behavior of the solutions after gelation , and in particular uniqueness , is not known .",
    "an example of a solvable cluster coagulation model is bertoin s _ model with limited aggregations",
    "_ @xcite , which we shall simply call the _ model with arms_. in this case , particles have a mass but also carry a certain number of potential links , called _ arms_. two particles of mass @xmath0 and @xmath1 may coagulate only if they have a positive number of arms , say @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "when they coagulate , an arm of each is used to create the bond and both arms are then deactivated , hence creating a particle with @xmath10 arms and mass @xmath3 .",
    "the coagulation rate of these two particles is @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath12 is the concentration of particles with @xmath13 arms and mass @xmath14 , then the coagulation equation reads @xmath15 for monodisperse initial concentrations , i.e. @xmath16 , with @xmath17 a measure on @xmath18 with unit mean , it is proved in @xcite that this equation has a unique solution on some interval @xmath19 , where @xmath20 if and only if @xmath21 , where @xmath22 in other words , if particles at time 0 have , on average , few arms , equation has a unique solution defined for all @xmath6 .",
    "when this is the case , as time passes , all available arms are used to create bonds and only particles with no arms remain in the system .",
    "the limit concentrations @xmath23 as @xmath24 of such particles turn out to be related to the distribution of the total population generated by a sub - critical galton - watson branching process ( see e.g. @xcite ) started from two ancestors : see @xcite and section [ limconc ] below .",
    "a formal computation shows that solutions of with multiplicative kernel @xmath25 should have constant mass @xmath26 i.e. @xmath27 .",
    "it is however well - known that if large particles can coagulate sufficiently fast , then one may observe in finite time a phenomenon called _ gelation _ , namely the formation of particles of infinite mass , the _",
    "gel_. these particles do not count in the computation of the mass so from the gelation time on , @xmath28 starts to decrease .",
    "the reason why can be solved , is that it can be transformed into a solvable pde involving the generating function of @xmath29 . in equation , this transformation is also possible for several particular choices of the kernel @xmath2 , namely when @xmath30 is constant , additive or multiplicative : see e.g. @xcite . in the multiplicative case @xmath25 , which is our main concern here , the total mass is a parameter of and of the associated pde , which is therefore easy to solve only when @xmath31 is known .",
    "existence and uniqueness of solutions of are thus easy up to gelation , since in this regime , the total mass @xmath28 is constant .",
    "after gelation , the gel may or may not interact with the other particles . if it does , equation has to be modified into flory s equation .",
    "else , the gel is inert , in which case smoluchowski s equation continues to hold .",
    "obviously , they are identical before gelation",
    ".    occurrence of gelation depends heavily on the choice of the coagulation rate @xmath2 , and in the multiplicative case , gelation always occurs @xcite .",
    "after gelation , the mass is not known , so @xmath28 itself becomes an unknown of the equation , and well - posedness of the equation is then much less trivial .",
    "the multiplicative kernel is therefore particularly interesting , since it exhibits a non - trivial behavior but can still be studied in detail by means of explicit computations .",
    "the same phenomenon of gelation has been observed in @xcite for for monodisperse initial concentrations @xmath32 .",
    "a formal computation shows that the the mean number of arms @xmath33 @xmath34 satisfies the equation @xmath35 and should therefore be equal to @xmath36 for all @xmath37 .",
    "in fact , this explicit expression holds only until a critical time , which is shown to be equal to @xmath38 if @xmath39 and to @xmath40 if @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is defined in .",
    "again , the associated pde is easy to solve before gelation since then , @xmath33 is known , while afterwards , the pde contains the unknown parameter @xmath33 .      in this paper",
    "we investigate the global behavior of smoluchowski s equation with arms before , at and after the gelation phase transition , proving existence and uniqueness of global solutions for a large class of initial conditions .",
    "the technique used , as in @xcite , is to transform the equation into a pde . since the total number of arms @xmath43 is not a priori known",
    ", this pde is non local , unlike the one obtained in the regime before gelation .",
    "this is the main difficulty we have to deal with .",
    "we use a modification of the classical method of characteristics to show uniqueness of solutions to this pde , and hence to .",
    "we can consider initial conditions @xmath44 with an initial infinite number of arms , that is , such that @xmath45 is infinite , and show that there is a unique solution `` coming down from infinity sufficiently fast '' , i.e. such that , for positive @xmath46 , @xmath47 note however that this is no technical condition , but a mere assumption to ensure that the equation is well - defined .",
    "we also consider a modification of this model which corresponds to flory s equation for the model with arms . in this",
    "setting , the infinite mass particles , that is , the gel , interact with the other particles .",
    "we also prove existence , uniqueness and study the behavior of the solutions for this model .    in both cases ,",
    "our technique provides a representation formula allowing to compute various quantities , as the mean number of arms in the system and the limiting concentrations . in flory s case , we extend to all possible initial concentrations the computations done in @xcite in absence of gelation . in the first model , a slight modification appears which calls for a probabilistic interpretation ; see section [ limconc ] below .",
    "this seems to be the first case of a cluster coagulation model for which global well - posedness in presence of gelation can be proven .",
    "another setting to which these techniques could be applied is the _ coagulation model with mating _ introduced in @xcite .      in @xcite , explicit solutions to are given for monodisperse initial conditions @xmath48 for some measure @xmath49 on @xmath18 with unit first moment .",
    "in particular , when there is no gelation , i.e. @xmath41 where @xmath42 is as in , and @xmath50 , there are limiting concentrations @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a probability measure on @xmath18 different from @xmath53 .",
    "this formula clearly resembles the well - known formula of dwass @xcite , which provides the law of the total progeny @xmath54 of a galton - watson process with reproduction law @xmath55 , started from two ancestors : @xmath56 the similarity between the two formulas is no coincidence and is explained in @xcite by means of the configuration model . for basics on galton - watson processes , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "let us briefly explain the result of @xcite , referring e.g. to @xcite for more results on general random graphs .",
    "the configuration model aims at producing a random graph whose vertices have a prescribed degree . to this end , consider a number @xmath57 of vertices , each being given independently a number of arms ( that is , half - edges ) distributed according to @xmath49 .",
    "then , two arms in the system are chosen uniformly and independently , and form an edge between the corresponding vertices .",
    "this procedure is repeated until there are no more available arms .",
    "hence , one arrives to a final state which can be described as a collection of random graphs . then corollary 2 in @xcite and the discussion below show that , when there is no gelation , the proportion of trees of size @xmath0 tends to @xmath23 when the number @xmath57 of vertices tends to infinity .",
    "hence , the final states in the configuration model and in smoluchowski s equation with arms coincide .",
    "this shows that the former is a good discrete model for coagulation .",
    "interestingly , the absence - of - gelation condition @xmath41 is equivalent to ( sub)-criticality of the galton - watson branching process with reproduction law @xmath55 , i.e. to almost sure extinction of the progeny , while @xmath39 and gelation at finite time are equivalent to super - criticality of the gw process .    in this paper , we obtain the limiting concentrations for and its modified version when there is gelation .",
    "let us start with the modified model , which is the counterpart of flory s equation for the model with arms . in this case , and with the same notations as above",
    ", we obtain the limit concentrations @xmath51 that is , the same explicit form as the one obtained in absence of gelation . again",
    ", this formula can be interpreted both in terms of a configuration model and of a super - critical galton - watson branching process .",
    "the relation between flory s equation with arms and the configuration model is natural , since in both cases all particles interact with each other , no matter what their size is .",
    "it is worth noticing that , even though the limit concentrations have the same form with or without gelation , still some mass is eventually lost in presence of gelation , see below .",
    "we also obtain the limiting concentrations for smoluchowski s equation with arms , namely @xmath58 where @xmath59 is some constant , which is @xmath60 when there is no gelation , and is greater than @xmath60 otherwise , see section [ seccinfsm ] .",
    "however , the probabilistic interpretation of @xmath59 is unclear",
    ". one can recover smoluchowski s equation with arms from discrete models by preventing big particles from coagulating , as is done in @xcite for the standard smoluchowski equation , but the precise meaning of @xmath59 still seems to require some labor .",
    "smoluchowski s equation has been extensively studied ; we refer to the reviews @xcite .",
    "conditions on the kernel @xmath30 are know for absence or presence of gelation , though this requires a precise definition of gelation , see e.g. @xcite , or @xcite in a probabilistic setting .",
    "for a general class of kernels smoluchowski s solution has a unique solution before gelation @xcite , and in the multiplicative case gelation always occurs @xcite .    for the monodisperse initial condition @xmath61 , the first proof of existence and uniqueness to before gelation is given in @xcite , and a proof of global existence and uniqueness can be found in @xcite .",
    "the case of general nonzero initial conditions has been considered by several papers in the physics literature @xcite , and by at least one mathematical paper @xcite , which however treats in full details only the regime before gelation , see remark [ see ] below .",
    "the same authors also provide in @xcite an exact formula for the post - gelation mass of , but with no rigorous proof .",
    "thus , a clear statement about well - posedness of for the most general initial conditions still seems to be missing , and our paper tries to fill this gap .",
    "we adapt the classical method of characteristics for generating functions , see @xcite , which yields easily uniqueness before gelation for a multiplicative kernel @xcite .",
    "we can in particular consider initial concentrations with infinite total mass , i.e. such that @xmath62 as long as @xmath63 .",
    "this covers for instance initial conditions of the type @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "our main concern is uniqueness , since existence of solutions has been obtained in a much more general setting by analytic @xcite or probabilistic @xcite means .",
    "however , the case of an infinite initial mass seems to have been considered only in @xcite in the discrete case , so we refer to section [ exist ] below for a proof .",
    "we start off in section 2 by considering existence , uniqueness and representation formulas for global solutions of , introducing and exploiting all main techniques which are needed afterwards to tackle the same issues in the case of .",
    "we prove that for the most general initial conditions @xmath66 , a positive measure on @xmath67 , smoluchowski s equation with a multiplicative kernel has a unique solution before and after gelation .",
    "we also show existence and uniqueness for the modified version of smoluchowski s model , namely flory s equation , in section 3 .",
    "the techniques used are generalized in section 4 and 5 , where we prove analogous results for the models with arms .",
    "we compute the limiting concentrations in section 6 , which are not trivial , in comparison with the standard smoluchowski and flory cases , for which they are always zero .",
    "in this section we develop our method in the case of equation , proving existence , uniqueness and representation formulas for global solutions .",
