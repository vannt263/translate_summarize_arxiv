    "general relativity ( gr ) has historically been underpinned by distinct types of experimental measurements , which have tested the geometric nature of the theory as well as the specific field equations of gr . in particular , the four `` classical tests '' are still carried out today with continuously improving accuracy .",
    "the first one is the observation of the perihelion advance of planets , for example mercury , which had been known by le verrier in 1845 , and explained by general relativity in 1915 ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the second is the bending of light by the sun , which was predicted by general relativity and first measured by eddington in 1919 during a solar eclipse @xcite .",
    "another test is the relativistic time delay of radio waves grazing the sun during their round trip to mercury and which was computed and measured by shapiro in 1964 @xcite .",
    "the gravitational redshift , also considered as a `` classical test '' , is actually a test of one facet of the equivalence principle .",
    "the weak equivalence principle has been verified with high precision using torsion balances @xcite and the lunar laser ranging @xcite .",
    "the gravitational redshift was predicted by einstein but not observed for a long time @xcite .",
    "it became observable with the advent of high precision quantum spectroscopy and was first measured in 1960 by pound and rebka @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , who used gamma ray spectroscopy of the radiation emitted and absorbed by @xmath0fe nuclei .",
    "the emitter and absorber were placed at the top and bottom of a @xmath1 high tower at harvard and the frequency difference predicted by gr was measured with about @xmath2 uncertainty . since then , the initial prediction of a gravitational redshift of solar spectral lines emitted at the sun s surface has also been measured @xcite .    in a test of the gravitational redshift using clocks , one checks that the clock rates are universal",
    " i.e. the relative rates depend only on the difference of gravitational potentials ( as determined by the trajectories of massive test bodies ) but not on the nature and internal structure of the clocks . in 1976",
    "a hydrogen - maser clock was launched on a rocket to an altitude of @xmath3 and its frequency compared to a similar clock on ground .",
    "this yielded a test of the gravitational redshift with about @xmath4 accuracy @xcite .",
    "the european space agency will fly in 2013 on the international space station the atomic clock ensemble in space ( aces ) , including a highly stable laser - cooled atomic clock , which will test ( in addition to many other applications in fundamental physics and metrology ) the gravitational redshift to a precision of about @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the gravitational redshift is also tested in null redshift experiments in which the rates of different clocks ( based on different physical processes or different atoms ) are compared to each other @xcite .    quite generally in a modern context , tests of gr measure the difference between the predictions of gr and of some generalized alternative theory or theoretical framework ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "for example , gr may be compared to alternative metric theories of gravitation such as the jordan - brans - dicke scalar - tensor theory @xcite .",
    "the metric theories may also be compared with non - metric theories of gravity such as the belinfante - swihart theory @xcite .",
    "it has to be kept in mind that the classification and inter - comparison of different tests have then to be defined with respect to the framework used .    in the following",
    "we will investigate , whether a gravimeter ( or accelerometer ) based on atom interferometry , can test the gravitational redshift .",
    "atom interferometers allow one to measure the acceleration of atoms falling in the gravitational field of the earth ( with respect to the experimental platform at rest on earth ) .",
    "the beam - splitter for atom waves is realized through the interaction of atoms with laser beams resonant with a hyperfine atomic transition .",
    "it is known @xcite that the main contribution to the phase shift in atom interferometers comes from the phase imprinted on the matter wave by the beam splitters . following earlier suggestions by bord @xcite ,",
    "the first gravimeter based on atom interferometry was realized by kasevich and chu @xcite . before that , the first gravimeter based on neutron interferometry had been realized by colella , overhauser and werner @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "atom interferometers have reached high sensitivities in the measurement of the gravitational acceleration @xcite and rotational acceleration through the sagnac effect @xcite .",
    "this yields very important tests of the weak equivalence principle or universality of free fall ( uff ) when comparing the free fall of atoms with that of classical macroscopic matter ( in practice a nearby freely falling corner cube whose trajectory is monitored by lasers ) .",
    "the relative precision of such tests of the uff is currently @xmath6 , using cs @xcite or rb @xcite atoms .",
    "although it remains less sensitive than tests using macroscopic bodies of different composition which have reached a precision of @xmath7 @xcite , this uff test is interesting as it is the most sensitive one comparing the free fall of quantum objects ( namely csium atoms ) with that of a classical test mass ( the corner cube ) .      in a recent paper , mller , peters and chu @xcite ( hereafter abbreviated as mpc ) proposed a new interpretation of atom interferometry experiments as testing the gravitational redshift , that is also the universality of clock rates ( ucr ) , with a precision @xmath6 , which is several orders of magnitude better than the best present @xcite and near future @xcite clock tests .",
    "the main argument of mpc ( see also the more detailed papers @xcite ) is based on an analogy between atom interferometry experiments and classical clock experiments .",
    "the idea of clock experiments is to synchronize a pair of clocks when they are located closely to one another , and move them to different elevations in a gravitational field .",
    "the gravitational redshift will decrease the oscillation frequency of the lower clock relative to the higher one , yielding a measurable phase shift between them .",
    "there are two methods for measuring the effect .",
    "either we bring the clocks back together and compare the number of elapsed oscillations , or we measure the redshift by means of continuous exchanges of electromagnetic signals between the two clocks . in both methods",
    "one has to monitor carefully the trajectories of the two clocks .",
    "for example , in the second method one has to remove the doppler shifts necessarily appearing in the exchanges of electromagnetic signals .    in the first method",
    ", the phase difference between the two clocks when they are recombined together , can be written as a difference of integrals over proper time , @xmath8 \\equiv \\omega \\oint { \\mathrm{d}}\\tau\\,.\\ ] ] the two clocks have identical proper frequency @xmath9 .",
    "we denote by i and ii the two paths ( with say i being at a higher altitude , i.e. a lower gravitational potential ) and use the notation @xmath10 to mean the difference of proper times between the two paths , assumed to form a close contour .",
    "the integrals in are evaluated along the paths of the clocks , and we may use the schwarzschild metric to obtain an explicit expression of the measured phase shift in the gravitational field of the earth .",
    "it is indeed true that the phase shift measured by an atom interferometer contains a contribution which is similar to the clock phase shift . in this analogy ,",
    "the role of the clock s proper frequency is played by the atom s ( de broglie-)compton frequency @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the rest mass of the atom .",
    "however the phase shift includes also another contribution @xmath13 coming from the interaction of the laser light used in the beam - splitting process with the atoms .",
    "thus , @xmath14 here we are assuming that the two paths close up at the entry and exit of the interferometer ; otherwise , additional terms have to be added to .",
    "the first term in is proportional to the atom s mass through the compton frequency and represents the difference of compton phases along the two classical paths .",
    "in contrast , the second term @xmath13 does not depend on the mass of the atoms .    at first sight , the first term in eq .",
    "could be used for a test of the gravitational redshift , in analogy with classical clock experiments , cf .",
    "eq .  , and the precision of the test could be very good , because the compton frequency of the csium atom is very high , @xmath15 . however , as shown in a previous brief reply @xcite , this re - interpretion of the atom interferometer as testing the ucr is fundamentally incorrect .",
    "the clear - cut argument showing that the atom interferometer does not measure the redshift is that the `` atom - clock '' contribution , i.e. the first term in , is in fact _",
    "zero _ for a closed total path @xcite .",
    "thus only the second term @xmath13 remains in eq .  .",
    "the final phase shift , @xmath16 depends on the wavevector @xmath17 of the lasers , on the interrogation time @xmath18 and on the local gravity @xmath19 , but is independent of the compton frequency .    in the present paper , we expand our previous brief reply and address in detail the involved issues .",
    "as we shall detail below , the first term in vanishes in gr and in all metric theories of gravity , and in a large class of non - metric test theories which emcompasses most theoretical frameworks used to interpret the violations of the different facets of the equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "the key point about the result is a consistent calculation of the two paths in the atom interferometer and of the phases along these paths , both derived from the same classical action , using in a standard way the principle of least action . at the deepest level ,",
    "the principle of least action and its use in atom interferometry comes from the feynman path integral formulation of quantum mechanics or equivalently the schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "we will see in the following that the argument of mpc ( developed in the initial paper @xcite ) implies a violation of the principle of least action .",
    "the significance and the sensitivity of atom interferometry should then be evaluated in the framework of an alternative theory because it is not consistent to calculate , as mpc do in @xcite , for the trajectories and @xmath20 for the phases , which again corresponds to two different lagrangians . ]",
    "the dephasing of the interferometer by using the feynman approach with two different lagrangians .",
    "instead , a different approach for the description of atom interferometers has to be developed for dealing with the violation of fundamental principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "these investigations lie at the interface between quantum mechanics and gravitational theories . one could wonder whether it is possible to provide clear answers to the question asked in the title of this paper .",
    "we shall see below that a number of clear - cut statements and definite conclusions will be obtained , provided the theoretical frameworks are specified clearly and unambiguously . to this aim",
    ", we shall consider two general alternative theoretical frameworks .",
    "the first framework , which we call the `` modified lagrangian formalism '' , consists of a deformation of the lagrangian of gr @xcite .",
    "such a modified lagrangian formalism is at the basis of the usual interpretation of the various tests of the equivalence principle , including the tests of the ucr and the uff , in a way consistent with schiff s conjecture @xcite , the principle of least action and the basic principles of quantum mechanics . within",
    "this general formalism ucr and uff tests are related ( violation of one implies violation of the other ) with the quantitative relationship depending on the formalism used .",
    "as we will show , in such theories the atom interferometer phase shift arising from the free evolution of the atoms is rigorously zero and thus the compton frequency plays no role .",
    "instead , the measured phase shift comes from the laser interactions and measures the free fall of the atoms using the laser as a `` ruler '' . in that sense the atom interferometers test uff , and indeed appear as such in the more recent publication of mpc @xcite .",
    "( @xcite , p.",
    "4 ) , where the subscripts refer to test masses 1 and 2 ( e.g. @xmath21cs and @xmath22falling corner cube in @xcite whilst @xmath21ti and @xmath22be in @xcite ) , and @xmath23 refers to the nuclear binding energy of the test masses . on the other hand ucr tests in @xcite set limits on either @xmath24 or @xmath25 ( @xcite , p.  3 ) , where @xmath26 is related to the atomic transition of the atom used in the clock and not to its nuclear binding energy . ] in the second framework , which we call the `` multiple lagrangian formalism '' , the _ motion _ of test particles ( atoms or macroscopic bodies ) obeys the standard gr lagrangian in a gravitational field , whereas the _ phase _ of the corresponding matter waves obeys a _ different _ lagrangian .",
    "the mpc analysis in @xcite belongs to this framework which raises extremely difficult problems .",
    "it violates the feynman path integral method which is at the basis of the computation of the quantum phase shift , as well as the schiff conjecture .",
    "in particular , the phase shift is derived in a manner which is not consistent with standard quantum mechanics .",
    "this derivation would thus require the development of a mathematically sound theory allowing one to go beyond standard quantum mechanics .",
    "it is only after this development that the interpretation of atom interferometry experiments as testing the gravitational redshift could be attributed an unambiguous meaning .    at this point",
    ", we also want to mention other crucial differences between atom interferometry and clock experiments . in clock experiments the trajectories of the clocks",
    "are continuously controlled for instance by continuous exchange of electromagnetic signals . in atom interferometry in contrast , the trajectories of the atoms are not measured independently but theoretically derived from the lagrangian and initial conditions .",
    "furthermore , we expect that it is impossible to determine independently the trajectories of the wave packets without destroying the interference pattern at the exit of the interferometer . ) and can not be applied in a gravitational field with large gravity gradients , or more generally with any lagrangian that is of higher order . ]",
    "another important difference lies in the very notion of a clock .",
    "atomic clocks use the extremely stable energy difference between two internal states . by varying the frequency of an interrogation signal ( e.g. microwave or optical ) , one obtains a resonant signal when the frequency is tuned to the frequency of the atomic transition . in their re - interpretation , mpc view the entire atom as a clock ticking at the compton frequency associated with its rest mass .",
    "but the `` atom - clock '' is not a real clock in the previous sense , since it does not deliver a physical signal at compton frequency , as also recently emphasized in the same context in ref .",

    "theoretical tools for atom optics and interferometry have been extensively developed @xcite .",
    "since atom interferometers are close to the classical regime ( @xmath27 ) , a path integral approach is very appropriate since it reduces to a calculation of integrals along classical paths for lagrangians which are at most quadratic in position and velocity .",

    "a sequence of vertical laser pulses resonant with a @xmath70 hyperfine transition is applied to the atoms during their ballistic ( i.e. free fall ) flight . in the actual experiments the atoms undergo a two - photon raman transition where the two raman laser beams are counter - propagating .",

    "the interferometer can be viewed as a clock .",
    "in fact , atomic clocks are a particular kind of interferometer which has been designed to have a strong sensitivity to @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "a simple example is an interferometer with only two pulses separated by a time @xmath18 . in that case",
    "one uses either a microwave field or raman transitions with two co - propagating laser beams so that @xmath120",
    ". then the photon recoil becomes negligibly small and the two paths are separated spatially at @xmath121 by much less than the coherence length of the atoms , allowing them to interfere .",
    "the total phase shift is then given by @xmath122 as mentioned above , all other terms in @xmath123 are exactly cancelled by corresponding terms arising from the non - closure of the paths .",
    "the laser phase shift is to leading order @xmath124 one therefore observes interference fringes when varying the frequency of the laser or microwave field , known as ramsey fringes .",
    "that allows locking the laser frequency to the atomic transition frequency @xmath119 , which constitutes an atomic clock .",
    "we note that the _ interference _ of the two interferometer arms is required for the operation of the clock , each arm individually can not be considered as a clock .",
    "if one wanted to use such interferometers ( clocks ) for a gravitational redshift test one would need two of them placed in different gravitational potentials ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "but , of course such clocks do not run at the compton frequency but at @xmath119 , and thus the corresponding redshift test is not at the compton frequency .",
    "for that to be the case one would need interferometers with the internal energy ( mass ) _ difference _ of the particles on the two paths @xmath125 .",
    "such a matter - antimatter interferometer is orders of magnitude beyond present day technology .      as a specific example , let us consider the prediction from gr , which has been extensively treated in ref .",

    "more precisely , this corresponds to the first scenario of mpc ( see `` methods '' , bottom of first column ) , where they calculate the phase shift by integrating the lagrangian with @xmath20 along the trajectories calculated with the standard value of @xmath19 . but use @xmath76 different from @xmath19 for the trajectories without explaining clearly how to calculate @xmath76 . ]    within this multiple lagrangian framework we derive the interferometer phase shift ( putting on a more rigorous basis the computation of mpc ) and then we show that this framework raises a number of unacceptable issues related to fundamental principles of quantum mechanics .",

    "the most important problem is that it is inconsistent to use a different lagrangian ( or metric ) for the calculation of the trajectories and for the phases of the atoms or clocks .",
    "more precisely , it supposes that the fundamental feynman path integral formulation of quantum mechanics , which is at the basis of the derivation of the phase shift in an atom interferometer ( see sec .  [ iia ] ) , has to be altered in the presence of a gravitational field or could be wrong",
    ". physically it amounts to making the distinction between the atoms when calculating their trajectories and the same atoms when calculating their phases , which is inconsistent as it is the same fundamental matter field in both cases .",
    "even more , the basis for writing eq .   for",
    "the derivation of the atom interferometry phase shifts ( as does mpc ) is unjustified because the feynman formalism is violated . to remain coherent some alternative formalism for the atomic phase shift calculations ( presumably modifying quantum mechanics )",
    "should be developed and used .",
    "more generally the multiple lagrangian formalism supposes that the duality between particles and waves in quantum mechanics gets somehow violated in a gravitational field .",
    "the above violation of the `` particle - wave duality '' , implied by the multiple lagrangian formalism , is very different from a violation of the equivalence principle in the ordinary sense . in this formalism",
    "a single physical object , the atom , is assumed to be described by two different lagrangians , @xmath180 applying to its phase shift , and @xmath181 applying to its trajectory .",

    "[ iiib ] , which does not imply any particle - wave duality violation .",
    "the second problem of theories in the multiple lagrangian formalism and of the interpretation of mpc is the violation of schiff s conjecture @xcite .",

    "expects that the three aspects of the einstein equivalence principle ( wep , lli and lpi ) are sufficiently entangled together by the mathematical formalism of the theory that it is impossible to violate one without violating all of them .",
    "the schiff conjecture has been proved using general arguments based upon the assumption of energy conservation @xcite .",
    "a contrario , we expect that violating the conjecture leads to some breakdown of energy conservation . in the present case",

    ", for which atom interferometry does not test the redshift . ]    in conclusion the multiple lagrangian formalism violates the feynman path integral formulation of quantum mechanics , the principle of least action and energy conservation , and schiff s conjecture .",
    "unfortunately , the claim made by mpc @xcite that atom gravimeters measure the gravitational redshift can only be substantiated within this formalism .      in this section",
    "we review and adapt for our purpose the important `` modified lagrangian framework '' , which is a powerful formalism for analyzing tests of the various facets of the einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) .",
    "this formalism allows deviations from gr and metric theories of gravity , with violations of the uff and ucr , and permits a coherent analysis of atom interferometry experiments .",
    "but it does not suffer from the shortcomings of the multiple lagrangian framework .",
    "the formalism describes the newtonian limit of a large class of non - metric theories , in a way consistent with schiff s conjecture and fundamental principles of quantum mechanics .    within this general formalism",
    "there is no fundamental distinction between uff and ucr tests , as violation of one implies violation of the other ( schiff s conjecture ) , thus testing one implies testing the other . depending on the theory used , different experiments test different parameters or parameter combinations at differing accuracies , so they may be complementary or redundant depending on the context .",
    "as we shall see , in such theories the mass of the atoms cancels out when computing the phase shift of the atom interferometer , and thus the atom s compton frequency is irrelevant . in that sense atom interferometers test uff ( and are indeed interpreted that way in the more recent work @xcite ) , but are insensitive to a test of ucr at the compton frequency .",
    "this class of theories is defined by a single lagrangian , that is however different from the gr lagrangian . in particular , the coupling between gravitation and different types of mass - energy is generically not universal @xcite .",
    "this leads to modifications of the gravitational redshift and also , more generally , to violations of the weak equivalence principle or universality of free fall , the local lorentz invariance and the local position invariance .",
    "but it does not imply a violation of the principle of least action nor of energy conservation , as it is based on a single lagrangian and , of particular interest here , the feynman path integral formulation of quantum mechanics remains valid .",
    "most alternative theories commonly considered belong to this class which encompasses a large number of models and frameworks ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "the modified lagrangian formalism is a physical framework in which the violation of eep originates from the anomalous behaviour of some particular type of energy in a gravitational field . for our purposes",

    "let us recall the results for traditional free fall and redshift experiments",
    ". by varying we obtain the equations of motion of the atom as @xmath195 which shows that the trajectory of the atom is affected by the violation of lpi and is not universal .",
    "in fact we see that @xmath191 measures the non - universality of the ratio between the atom s passive gravitational mass and inertial mass .",
    "thus , in the modified lagrangian framework the violation of lpi implies a violation of wep and the uff , and @xmath191 appears to be the uff - violating parameter .",
    "this is a classic example @xcite of the validity of schiff s conjecture , namely that it is impossible to violate lpi ( or lli ) without also violating wep .",
    "the violation of lpi is best reflected in classical redshift experiments with clocks which can be analysed using a cyclic gedanken experiment based on energy conservation @xcite .",
    "the result for the frequency shift in a pound - rebka type experiment is @xmath196 where the redshift violating ( or ucr violating ) parameter @xmath164 is again non - universal . as such it has to be carefully distinguished from the redshift violation parameter @xmath161 appearing in eq .   of the previous section",
    "[ see also the discussion after ] .",
    "the important point , proven in refs .",
    "@xcite , is that within the framework of the modified lagrangian , the ucr violating parameter @xmath164 is related in a precise way to the uff - violating parameter @xmath191 , namely ( see e.g. eqs .",

    "but then @xmath202 is a universal parameter which can be re - absorbed into the definition of @xmath19 . to obtain an effect in this case one needs to invoke the multiple lagrangian formalism of sec .",
    "[ iiia ] . ]    for example , let us assume a model in which all types of electromagnetic energy are coupled in a non - universal way , i.e. @xmath203 ( with all other forms of energies behaving normally ) , and where the clock transition is purely electromagnetic .",
    "the uff test between two materials @xmath165 and @xmath204 , both containing electromagnetic energy , is carried out with an uncertainty of @xmath205 @xcite . on the other hand the ucr test for a clock of type @xmath165 based on an electromagnetic transition , is carried out with an uncertainty of @xmath206 @xcite . for macroscopic test bodies",
    "the nuclear electromagnetic binding energy contributes typically to about @xmath207 of the total mass @xcite , so we may have @xmath208 , which yields for the uff test a limit of about @xmath209 .",
    "this is still a much more stringent limit than the ucr test @xmath210 .",
    "so in such a model uff tests are significantly more sensitive than ucr tests .    however , that result depends on the particular model used .",
    "if we assume another model in which the nuclear spin plays a role leading to a non - universal coupling of atomic hyperfine energies , i.e. @xmath211 ( with other forms of energies and properties of the atom behaving normally ) , the result is different .",
    "the precise mechanism is unknown , but one could imagine an abnormal coupling of nuclear spin to gravity , but with the standard coupling of the electromagnetic nuclear binding energy , which is spin independent , still satisfied .",
    "atomic hyperfine energies are of order @xmath212 ( corresponding to ghz transition frequencies ) which for typical atomic masses leads to @xmath213 . as a consequence uff tests set a limit of only @xmath214 while ucr tests using hyperfine transitions",

    "the conclusion is therefore radically different in this model where ucr tests perform orders of magnitude better than uff tests .    to summarize , the two types of tests , uff and ucr , are complementary in the modified lagrangian framework , and need to be pursued with equal vigor , because depending on the model used either one of the tests can prove significantly more sensitive than the other .",
    "a corollary is that usual tests of ucr do not need a violation of schiff s conjecture to be meaningfully interpreted .",
    "they can perfectly be contrasted with uff tests within a formalism satisfying the schiff conjecture .",
    "let us now consider the application to atom interferometry . in the experiment of refs .",
    "@xcite the `` atom - clock '' that accumulates a phase is of identical composition to the falling object ( the same atom ) , hence one has to consistently use the same value of @xmath191 when calculating the trajectories and the phase difference using the lagrangian inserted into .",

    "it is related to the cancellation between the special relativistic effect [ last term in ] and the gravitational potential energy [ third term in ] , discussed in more detail below .",

    "note that this expression is equivalent to the one obtained by mpc in their recent paper @xcite ( p.  4 ) , but different from the one obtained in the same paper ( p.  3 ) for ucr tests ( see also a footnote in sec .",
    "[ ib ] ) .    as already mentioned the vanishing of @xmath123 and thus the non - sensitivity to the gravitational redshift in the `` atom - clock '' phase",
    "is related to the cancellation between the special relativistic term and the gravitational term when integrating along the trajectories .",
    "more generally , the underlying fundamental point here is that for a measurement of the gravitational redshift one wants to determine the non - zero effect of the gravitational redshift term [ third term in or ] on the clock phase ( atom or classical ) _ independently _ of the effect of the special relativistic term [ fourth term in or ] and of possible other phase shifts ( e.g. the light phase @xmath225 ) .",
    "this is generally done by using independent measurements that provide the knowledge of the trajectories of the clocks @xmath226 and their velocities @xmath227 .",
    "one uses that knowledge to subtract the time dilation and light phase shifts from the overall measured shift @xmath81 . the remaining gravitational redshift term",

    "in contrast , in the atom - interferometry experiment the trajectories are not measured independently but theoretically derived from the lagrangian and initial conditions , thus making a `` pure '' measurement of the gravitational term impossible .",
    "one might even argue that in such an experiment the independent determination of the wave packet trajectories ( e.g. by high resolution imagery ) would be impossible as it would destroy the interference at the interferometer exit according to one of the fundamental tenets of quantum mechanics .",

    "one finds most alternative approaches that postulate a non - universal coupling between gravity and other fields of the standard model of particle physics or its extensions ( see e.g. @xcite ) , including some versions of string theory , brane scenarios , parameterized frameworks , etc .",

    "tests of the universality of free fall ( uff ) and of the universality of clock rates ( ucr ) are related , with the quantitative relationship depending on the particular theory used , and the corresponding nuclear and atomic models .",
    "we have shown that in this class of models the free propagation phase shift @xmath231 and therefore the compton frequency plays no role ; the interferometer can not be viewed as measuring the cumulated phase - difference of the `` compton - clocks '' .",

    "the atom gravimeter experiments are thus tests of the weak equivalence principle or universality of free fall at the @xmath6 accuracy level , see eq .  .",
    "as such they are less accurate than other uff tests @xcite but still interesting as they are the best tests of this kind which compare the free fall of quantum objects to that of classical test masses .",
    "the second class of models relies on multiple lagrangians ( sec .",
    "[ iiia ] ) . within this class ,",
    "the atom interferometry experiment can be seen as a test of the gravitational redshift , in line with the claims of mpc @xcite , but at the expense of extreme conceptual difficulties : the basic principles of quantum mechanics , such as the feynman path integral formulation and schrdinger s equation , are affected , as well as energy conservation and the schiff conjecture .",
    "this is because two lagrangians are used in this class of models , one for the trajectory of the atoms and another one for the phase of the associated matter field .",
    "in addition , these models pose a fundamental problem for calculating phases in atom interferometry tests , since the standard formula for phase shifts is based on principles of quantum mechanics which are violated in this class of alternative theories .",
    "we conclude that the general statement of mpc according to which the atom interferometer measures or tests the gravitational redshift at the compton frequency is incorrect .",
    "instead , the interpretation of the experiment needs to be considered in the light of alternative theories or frameworks . although one can consider particular alternative frameworks in which the statement of mpc could make sense , such frameworks raise unacceptable conceptual problems which are not at the moment treated in a satisfactory manner .",
    "in particular , they break the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics which are used for calculating matter wave phases . in most common and plausible theoretical frameworks",
    "the atom interferometry experiment tests the universality of free fall with the compton frequency being irrelevant .",

    "in this appendix we show that the phase shift induced by gravity in neutron interferometers is given by an expression similar to that in atom interferometry . in consistency with the analogy between neutron and atom interferometry pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the gravitational phase shift is independent of the compton frequency also for the neutrons .",
    "neutron interferometers have been first used for the measurement of the gravitational acceleration in 1975 @xcite .",
    "a neutron beam is bragg scattered by three silicon crystal planes and forms an interferometer as shown in fig .",

    "the well known bragg condition for the scattering at the crystal planes is @xmath238 with @xmath239 the atomic spacing in the crystal lattice . substituting eq .   into eq .",
    "one easily obtains @xmath240 where @xmath241 is the projection of the lattice wave vector @xmath242 onto the direction of the gravitational field @xmath243 .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "is formally identical to eq .   with the lattice wave vector playing the role of the laser wave vector . in both cases ,",
    "the expression for the phase shift is independent of the mass of the atoms ( neutrons ) or the associated compton frequency . in both cases ,",
    "the interferometer is to be understood as measuring the free fall of the atoms ( neutrons ) using the laser ( crystal lattice ) as a `` ruler '' .",
    "as we have seen , for any quadratic lagrangian the difference of classical actions is zero or reduces to the contribution of internal energies . in this appendix , although this has already been presented in much greater detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , we estimate the magnitude of the effect of including cubic terms in the lagrangian of gr , due to second - order gravity gradients , i.e. @xmath244+\\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{z}^2\\,.\\ ] ] for such cubic lagrangian we expect that the difference of classical actions will no longer be zero . on dimensional grounds",
    "we expect that the result should then be given by . ]",
    "@xmath245 where @xmath246 denotes some global coefficient of the order of one . by integrating the lagrangian along the classical paths one obtains @xmath247 .",
    "we note that for the lagrangian the interferometer closes up only when we adjust the time @xmath77 to a value that is different from @xmath18 .",
    "so the interferometer is no longer symmetric and there is a contribution coming from the difference of internal energies @xmath74 of the atoms , given by @xmath248 the first term in gives a non zero contribution which could be interpreted as a redshift effect by analogy with classical clock experiments .",
    "however , we insist that in order to compute correctly the phase shift one would have to revisit the derivation made in sec .",
    "[ iia ] for the case of cubic and higher - order lagrangians .",
    "if we assume that at least the order of magnitude given by the first term in is correct , the effect is extremely small . with @xmath249 , @xmath250 and @xmath251 , it gives a relative correction to the main effect ( i.e. @xmath252 ) of the order of @xmath253 , much too small to be measured in the atom interferometry experiments @xcite whose current precision is about @xmath254 .",
    "therefore we conclude that the redshift effect in atom interferometry , if it exists at all , is very small and currently undetectable ."
