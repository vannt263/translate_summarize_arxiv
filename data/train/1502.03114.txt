    "therefore it follows that @xmath52    the bound ( [ nbound ] ) has been derived for the case of massless quarks .",

    "moreover we have found numerically that everywhere in @xmath32 we have @xmath58 and the maxima @xmath59 of @xmath60 are decreasing with increasing @xmath56 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gu ] .",
    "this is consistent with the observation of ref",
    ".  @xcite that @xmath59 is a monotonically growing function of @xmath55 .",
    "therfore @xmath61 this allows us to estimate the effect of the charm quark on the ratio : @xmath62 where the last inequality follows from ( [ gfbound ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath63 without any superscript refers to the structure function with light flavors only and that dependence on @xmath55 has been suppressed .",
    "we see therefore , in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , that inclusion of charm lowers the bound on @xmath64 in proportion that depends on @xmath65 . for @xmath44  gev/@xmath45 and for the lowest @xmath55 in the present data set we get numerically @xmath66 ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : gu ] ) ) , which gives @xmath67 .",
    "we do not know what is the fraction of charm in the present data sample , however taking a typical value of @xmath68 , we get that @xmath69 .",
    "this means that bound ( [ nbound ] ) is lowered for the lowest @xmath55 bin by approximately 18% and is approaching ( [ nbound ] ) for higher @xmath55 . in the following",
    "we will ignore charm contribution and stick to the bound ( [ nbound ] ) coming back to this point in sect .",
    "[ sec : modelsbound ] .",
    "in order to check how far the bound ( [ nbound ] ) overestimates actual predictions of the dipole model with realistic dipole - proton cross - section , we are going to compute ratio ( [ nbound ] ) for a given @xmath70 in terms of scaling variable @xmath71 .",
    "we will see that for commonly used parametrizations of @xmath70 , ratio @xmath72 is a slowly varying function of @xmath71 with a maximum equal approximately @xmath73 , which only slightly depends on the parametrization actually used . to this end",
    "we have decided to perform our own fits to the @xmath19 data over the restricted kinematical range where the longitudinal structure function @xmath14 has been measured by h1 .",
    "the reason for this is threefold .",
    "firstly , new data is of much better quality than the previous data to which the dipole model parameters have been fitted .",
    "secondly , we do not aim at a global fit , but rather at a fit which covers only the points where @xmath14 has been measured as well .",
    "therefore fit parameters  as we shall see in the following  will be different from the ones obtained in the global fits . and finally , we have decided to fit the data with the help of geometrical scaling  a procedure not used so far in the fits to the dis data .",

    "this happens because points corresponding to one particular value of @xmath12 but different @xmath13 s ( see `` stacks '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2l_data ] ) correspond to different values of @xmath71 and are therefore shifted horizontally  if plotted in terms of @xmath71  by values that are different for different @xmath13 s . as a consequence dipole model predictions fall on a universal curve ( up to an overall normalization @xmath80 ) , and data fitting",
    "consists in changing @xmath80 and the parameters defining scaling variable @xmath71 , _ i.e. _ @xmath78 and @xmath77 . by varying these three parameters one forces experimental points to fall on theoretical prediction , rather than by changing theoretical predictions one is trying to reproduce experimental points . therefore",
    "this method is very efficient , as it does not require time consuming recalculations of the theoretical curve .    even in the case of dipole - proton cross - sections that violate gs by explicit ( albeit weak ) dependence on @xmath13 , like in the model of iancu , itakura and munier @xcite , it is still possible to make a gs - like fit by keeping @xmath13 at some fixed average value @xmath81 and then study the uncertainty of theoretical predictions by changing @xmath13 over the range that is covered by experimental data .",
    "we shall come back to this point later .",
    "let us first consider the simplest version of the dipole model , namely the gbw parametrization @xcite , which  up to an overall normalization @xmath80  takes the following form in terms of scaling variable @xmath71@xmath82 pluging ( [ sigmagbw ] ) into eqs.([f2fl ] ) gives unnormalized theoretical prediction for the structure functions divided by @xmath55 , which will be denoted in the following by small characters @xmath83 .",

    "this kinematical region does not extend to very small @xmath13 s as it is in the case of the recently published combined hera data @xcite and therefore fitted parameters are different than the ones of global fits . for the same reason the iim model @xcite that has been specifically devised for low @xmath13 region gives larger @xmath127 than the simplest version of the the gbw model @xcite , which quite satisfactorily describes @xmath2 .    in order to fit model parameters",
    "we have used the property of geometrical scaling , which boils down to the fact that data points of the same @xmath55 but different @xmath13 s disperse when plotted in terms of scaling variable @xmath71 and fall on one line ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig : f2l_data ] and _ e.g. _ [ fig : f2_gbw ] ) . we have found that gs is present both in the case of @xmath2 and @xmath0 as well .",
    "one should , however , take this property with care for the present set of data , since for each value of @xmath55 only a few points of different bjorken @xmath13 s have been measured .",
    "this @xmath157 correlation of the dis data , particularly pronounced in the present case of @xmath0 , is a common obstacle in deriving firm conclusions on the quality of gs . in this context",
    "it is also worth mentioning that there exist different sources of gs . the first one is related to the genuine property of the initial state of the proton target described theoretically by the color glass condensate formalism @xcite and nonlinearities in the parton evolution @xcite , which are of importance at small values of bjorken @xmath13 .",
    "the other one is a property of the linear parton evolution equations @xcite , which build gs at larger @xmath55 and at not necessarily very small @xmath13 s .",
    "we have next compared dipole model predictions  with parameters fixed by fits to @xmath2  with @xmath0 data . here , due to large experimental errors , agreement is quite good .",
    "next we have studied ratio of the structure functions @xmath158 for which in the dipole model there exists a strict bound @xmath159 ( [ bound ] ) derived in ref .",

    "we have also shown that in the dipole models discussed above @xmath160 which is approximately 18.5% below the emns bound .",
    "different fits give very similar ratio @xmath53 , which is only residually dependent on the values of fit parameters ( this concerns only the iim dipole model , since ratio @xmath1 is parameter independent in the gbw case ) . comparing @xmath158 with the data we have established that the gbw model reproduces @xmath161 with high precision .",
    "we do not see any tension between the data and the dipole model as far as ratio @xmath161 is concerned , even if charm mass effects , which lower the emns bound , are taken into account .",
    "dipole model and the emns bound discussed so far rely on the first fock component of the photon wave function . including higher fock components , like a @xmath20 state ,",
