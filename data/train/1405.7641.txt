    "semiconductor lasers with a saturable absorber can generate short and high - power optical pulses by the mechanisms of self - pulsation and mode - locking @xcite .",
    "these modes of operation are typically associated with different timescales determined by the relaxation oscillation frequency [ ghz ] and the round trip time in the cavity [ 10 - 100s ghz ] . as self - pulsations ( sps )",
    "are often a significant source of instability in mode - locked lasers , a thorough understanding of mechanisms leading to their appearance is desirable @xcite .",
    "the model of a laser with a saturable absorber ( lsa model ) considers the dynamics of the total field on time scales long compared to the round trip time in the cavity .",
    "while it can not therefore describe phenomena such as mode - locking , this model has provided valuable insights into the origins of sps and the factors that lead to the appearance of bistability in devices with saturable absorbers @xcite .",
    "quantitative dynamical models of semiconductor lasers with saturable absorbers include travelling - wave methods that consider the spatio - temporal dynamics of the slowly - varying electric fields @xcite .",
    "a lumped element time domain model has also been developed that eliminates the spatial dependence in favour of a delay - differential equation for the field variable @xcite .",
    "these models are efficient tools for understanding the physical origins of complex spectral and pulse shaping mechanisms in mode - locked semiconductor lasers @xcite .    for certain applications of these devices however , we may be interested in quantities such as the frequency and phase - noise properties of the individual locked modes rather than the pulse train generated by the device .",
    "examples include stable terahertz frequency generation and tailored comb - line emission demonstrated recently by our group @xcite .",
    "these fabry - perot ( fp ) lasers included a spectral filter to limit the number of active modes , and here it may be appropriate to formulate the problem of describing the dynamics in the frequency domain .",
    "in such a model , each longitudinal mode of the cavity is considered as an independent dynamical variable @xcite .",
    "the round - trip time in the cavity then determines the mode spacing , and by including phase - sensitive modal interactions in the model , one can describe mode - locked states as mutually injection locked steady - states of the system @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider a device that supports two longitudinal modes with a large frequency spacing . in this case , a frequency domain description based on an extension of the lsa model represents a natural starting point .",
    "a transition to mode - locking is not possible in this device .",
    "instead , we have found familiar single - mode sp dynamics , but also interesting examples of coupled dual - mode dynamics . here",
    "we describe a transition to a multimode state where the total intensity experiences bursts of fast pulsations .",
    "we show that in this state the individual modes follow oppositely directed spiralling orbits that are related to the underlying sp dynamics of the system .",
    "our modeling approach is valid for small values of the gain and loss per cavity round trip . because these approximations are not expected to hold in a semiconductor laser , our results are necessarily qualitative",
    "however , we highlight an interesting example of a multimode instability that can arise in two - section devices with large dispersion , and our results can guide the future development of optimized mode - locked devices with tailored spectra .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : experiment ] we introduce our device and experimental setup .",

    "[ sec : modelling ] we describe our proposed model equations , which are a multimode extension of the lsa model that accounts for dispersion of gain and saturable absorption with wavelength in the system . in section [ sec : analysis ] we uncover the bifurcation structure of the system leading to the measured results .",

    "we identify these dynamics as single mode self - pulsations , which appear following a region of constant output in mode @xmath7 at threshold .",

    "the power spectra become symmetric with a large range of frequencies present , including a signature of low - frequency modulation in the 100 mhz range .",

    "the region of complex dynamics is bounded at a large pump current by a subcritical hopf bifurcation in @xmath6 .    .",

    "a plot of the mode - resolved and total intensity time traces taken from the region of complex coupled dynamics in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_full_qs - qs ] with @xmath91 = 5.2 is shown in the left - hand panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_qs - qs ] . when compared to our experimental results",
    ", there is a greater degree of asymmetry between the dynamics of the two modes in this example . unlike the previous example however ,",
    "the frequency of the bursts of fast pulsations of the total intensity is now accurately matched to our experimental results .",
    "we note also that the observed bifurcation sequence provides an explanation for the dynamics we found at intermediate values of the pump current in our experiment .",
    "we can now see that the discontinuity in the frequency of the intensity modulation of @xmath32 was due to the momentary appearance of a stable dual - mode steady state in the system , leading to the absence of any structure in the intensity power spectrum over this interval .",
    "in addition , we must reinterpret the region after the discontinuity as a dual - mode state with strong intensity modulation , but where the amplitude of the component in @xmath62 is very weak .",
    "the time - traces of fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_qs - qs ] are depicted in a phase - space representation on the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_qs - qs ] .",
    "if we consider trajectories close to the single - mode equilibrium state of @xmath62 , these trajectories are attracted towards the single mode manifold as the single - mode equilibrium state has a negative transverse lyapunov exponent . because this state is unstable in the single - mode manifold , as the trajectory approaches the manifold it is repelled into a spiralling orbit towards the sp limit cycle , which is stable within the @xmath62 manifold .",
    "this is the origin of the fast pulsations that grow from the quasi - single mode steady state of @xmath62 .",
    "once the trajectory approaches the sp limit cycle , it feels the transverse instability of this limit cycle and is ultimately ejected from the region near the single - mode manifold , undergoing a large amplitude excursion where both fields have large intensity .",
    "this large excursion leads the trajectory to enter the slow region near zero intensity , where it is drawn towards the single mode manifold of @xmath32 , where the single mode equilibrium state is stable within the manifold .",
    "this leads to the cycle of fast pulsations that decay towards the single mode equilibrium state of @xmath32 .",
    "finally , as the trajectory approaches the equilibrium , it is repelled on account of the positive transverse lyapunov exponent of this state .",
    "this repulsion drives the trajectory towards the transversally attracting equilibrium state of @xmath62 and the cycle begins again .",
    "the switch in intensity from @xmath32 to @xmath62 is along a corkscrew type trajectory that is wound around the line connecting the equilibrium states in the two single mode manifolds .",
    "this winding may be a signature of the dual - mode limit cycle present before the region of complex dynamics .",
    "( upper panel ) and @xmath62 ( lower panel ) .",
    "single and dual - mode equilibrium states are labeled @xmath103 and tme respectively .",
    "bifurcation points are single - mode hopf bifurcations ( h ) , transcritical ( tc ) , dual - mode hopf bifurcations ( @xmath104 ) , torus bifurcations ( t ) and limit point ( lp ) .",
    "solid and dashed lines indicate stable and unstable objects respectively .",
    "the results of numerical simulations of the coupled system are included as a guide .",
    "solid vertical lines bound the region of complex dual - mode dynamics . ]    to investigate this question and to shed more light on the bifurcation structure in this system , in fig .",
    "[ fig : tm_region_auto ] we have plotted numerical continuation results obtained using auto @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that the instability of the dual - mode limit cycle leading to complex dynamics is due to a supercritical torus bifurcation ( t ) .",
    "we can also see that the dual - mode limit cycle is present as an unstable object throughout the region of complex dynamics , and that there is evidence for further bifurcations of interest involving this object beyond the boundary of the region of complex dual - mode dynamics .",
    "in particular , we can see that the unstable dual - mode limit cycle collides with the unstable branch of single - mode sps of mode @xmath62 in a transcritical bifurcation ( tc ) .",
    "this results in the unstable branch of single - mode sps becoming transversally stable for decreasing pump values until the subcritical hopf bifurcation of @xmath62 is reached .",
    "this narrow region of transverse stability for this unstable branch of sps may explain the sharp feature near the relaxation oscillation frequency found in the power spectral data of fig .",
    "[ fig : exptgain ] .",
    "the diminishing strength of this feature with increasing current could be a result of the growth of the limit cycle away from the location of the stable equilibrium .",
    "finally , we note that although a complete discussion of the bifurcation structure that organises the dynamics of fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_qs - qs ] is beyond the scope of the current paper , we can highlight a number of interesting parallels with previous work on optically injected dual - mode devices @xcite .",
    "mathematically , this system is also four dimensional , but it features a single , three dimensional invariant manifold corresponding to the single - mode injected system . despite the lower symmetry of the dual - mode injected system , in the example of @xcite , we also found a saw - tooth structure characterized by symmetric but oppositely directed trajectories of the two modes .",
    "these dynamics originated in a torus bifurcation of a dual - mode periodic orbit .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite considered an example of bursting dynamics from the region of the single - mode manifold .",
    "these dynamics appeared near a cusp - pitchfork bifurcation of limit cycles and a curve of global saddle - node heteroclinic bifurcations .",
    "we will present a similar two - parameter bifurcation study of the current system and explore these connections further in future work .",
    "we have presented an experimental and theoretical study of the dynamics of a dual - mode semiconductor laser with a saturable absorber .",
    "the device was a specially engineered fabry - perot laser designed to support two primary modes with a large frequency spacing .",
    "fixing the voltage applied to the absorber section , we performed a sweep in drive current in the gain section of the device .",
    "we found that the dynamics evolved from familar self - pulsations in a single mode of the device into a complex dynamical state of both modes . by extending the well - known rate equation model for the semiconductor laser with a saturable absorber to the multimode case",
    ", we were able to reproduce the observed dynamics , and to show the fundamental role played by material dispersion in both sections of the device in governing their appearance .",
