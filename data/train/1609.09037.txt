    "electric vehicles ( evs ) have several advantages over the traditional gasoline powered vehicles . for example , evs are more environment friendly and more energy efficient . realizing the above",
    ", regulators ( e.g. federal energy regulator commission ( ferc ) ) are providing incentives to the consumers to switch to electric vehicles .",
    "manufacturers ( e.g. tesla , nissan ) are increasingly developing evs equipped with superior technologies . as a result",
    ", electric vehicles are increasingly becoming popular .",
    "however , a wide deployment of evs requires an extensive network of charging stations which can be capable of capable of charging large number of vehicles .",
    "the successful deployment of charging stations crucially depends on the profit of the charging stations and how efficiently the resources are used for charging the electric vehicles .",
    "the necessity of the profit of the charging stations is self - explanatory as without profitable charging stations , the wide deployment of the evs will remain a distant dream . on the other hand , because of the environment friendly nature of the electric vehicles , it is also important for the regulators to increase the user ( or , consumer ) surplus to provide incentive for the users . hence , selecting a price is an imperative issue for the charging stations .",
    "the charging stations may participate in the demand response , hence intelligent allocation of the resources among the evs is a key component for efficient load management and fulfilling the potential of evs deployment .",
    "we propose a menu based pricing scheme for charging an ev .",
    "whenever , an ev arrives the charging station , the charging station offers a variety of contracts @xmath1 at price @xmath2 to the user where the user will be able to use up to @xmath3 units of energy within the deadline @xmath4 for completion .",
    "the ev either accepts one of the contracts by paying the specified price or rejects all of those based on its payoff .",
    "we assume that the user gets an utility for consuming @xmath3 amount of energy with the deadline @xmath4 .",
    "the payoff of the user ( or , user s surplus ) for a contract is the difference between the utility and the price paid for one contract .",
    "the user will select the option which fetches the highest payoff .",
    "the various advantages of the above pricing scheme should be noted .",
    "first , it is an online pricing scheme .",
    "it can be adapted for each arriving user .",
    "second , since the charging station offers prices for different levels of charging required and the deadline , an efficient utilization can be achieved .",
    "the charging station can prioritize one contract over the others depending on the energy resources available . additionally , offering favorable prices for shorter deadlines can attract users to vacate the charging stations early and only use it when it is necessary .",
    "third , the user s decision is much simplified .",
    "she only needs to select one of the contracts ( or , reject all ) and will receive the prescribed amount within the prescribed deadline .",
    "we consider that the charging station is equipped with renewable energy harvesting devices and a storage device for storing energies .",
    "the charging station may also buy conventional energy from the market to fulfill the contract of the use if required .",
    "for each contract @xmath1 to the new user , we show that the optimal cost of fulfilling the contract is equivalent to minimize the cost through allocating energy @xmath3 for the new user within the deadline @xmath4 with simultaneously satisfying the demand the already existing users in the station .",
    "the charging station s profit is the difference between the payment the user makes if it selects one of the contracts and the additional cost to fulfill the contract for new user . note that whether a user buys a specific contract also depends on the prices selected for the other contracts .",
    "we consider two optimization problems ",
    "i ) social welfare maximization , and ii ) maximization of the ev charging station s profit .",
    "we first propose a pricing scheme which maximizes the social welfare _ irrespective of whether the charging station is aware of the utilities of the users or not_. the pricing scheme is very simple to compute , as the charging station selects a price which is equal to the cost for fulfilling a certain contract ( theorem  [ thm : pricestrategy ] and corollary [ thm : price_expected ] ) . however , the above pricing scheme does not provide any positive profit to the charging stations .",
    "thus , such a pricing scheme may not be useful to the charging station .",
    "we show that when a charging station is _ clairvoyant _",
    "( i.e. the primary knows the utilities of the users ) , there exists a pricing scheme which satisfies both the objectives ( theorem  [ thm : profit_max ] ) .",
    "though it has the above favorable property , in the above pricing mechanism , the user s surplus becomes @xmath0 .",
    "thus , a _ clairvoyant _ charging station may not be beneficial for the user s surplus .",
    "the charging station may not know the exact utilities of the users , however it may know the distribution function from where it is drawn .",
    "we investigate the existence of a pricing mechanism which maximizes the ex - post social welfare i.e. maximizes the social welfare for every possible realization of the utility function . in the scenario where the charging station does not know the exact utilities of the users ,",
    "we show that there _ may not exist a pricing strategy which simultaneously maximize the ex - post social welfare and the expected profit_. one has to give away the ex - post social welfare maximization in order to achieve expected profit maximization .",
    "thus , unlike when the charging station _ is clairvoyant _ , there may not exist a pricing strategy which simultaneously satisfies both the objectives when only distributions are known .",
    "we propose a pricing strategy which can fetch the highest possible profit to the charging station under the condition that it maximizes the ex - post social welfare ( theorem  [ thm : profitmax_uncertainty ] ) . above pricing strategy provides a _ worst case _ maximum profit to the charging station .",
    "we show that such a pricing strategy can fetch a higher profit when the charging station can harvest a large amount of renewable energy or possess a storage device of large capacity .",
    "however , the profit only increases up to a certain threshold , beyond that threshold harvested energy has no effect on the profit .",
    "the user s payoff also shows a similar trend .    since the above pricing strategy may not yield the",
    "_ maximum expected _ profit to the charging station , we have to relax the constraint the social welfare to be maximized in order to yield a higher profit to the charging station .",
    "whether a contract will be selected by the user does not depend on the price of the contract , but also the prices of other contracts .",
    "thus , achieving a pricing scheme which maximizes the expected profit is difficult because of the discontinuous nature of the profits .",
    "we propose a pricing strategy which yields a fixed ( say , @xmath5 ) amount of profit to the charging station .",
    "we show that the above pricing strategy also maximizes the social welfare with a desired level of probability for a suitable choice of @xmath5 ( theorem  [ thm : approx ] ) .",
    "hence , such a pricing scheme is also attractive to the regulators .",
    "further , we show that a suitable choice of @xmath5 can maximize the profit of the charging station for a class of utility functions ( theorem  [ thm : aclassutility ] ) .",
    "finally , we , numerically , study different pricing strategies and their impacts on the profits , and the social welfare ( section  [ sec : simulation_results ] ) .",
    "we , empirically provide insights how a trade - off between the profit of the charging station and the social welfare can be achieved for various pricing schemes .",
    "we also show that how our pricing scheme can reduce the number of charging spots and increase efficiency compared to the existing mechanisms .",
    "_ to the best our knowledge",
    "this is the first attempt to consider contract based online pricing for controlling the charging pattern and deadline of the evs .",
    "_ however , other pricing mechanisms to control the charging pattern for ev charging have been proposed .",
    "for example , @xcite studied the users behavior at different prices . @xcite",
    "considered a day - ahead pricing mechanism for ev charging where under the uncertainty of the driving pattern .",
    "@xcite considered a stackelberg game model to select prices for controlling the residential charging .",
    "@xcite proposed a price mechanism to control the congestion in the charging station , however it considered the aggregator is aware of the utilities and the user s arrival times , deadlines are known beforehand . vickery - clark - grove ( vcg ) auction mechanisms and their variants",
    "have been studied for ev charging . in @xcite",
    "an extended second price auction mechanism has been proposed where users bid their deadlines , arrival times and valuations for different energy levels . however , all these mechanisms are suitable for residential charging , where users can control the charging pattern at each instance . in a private or road side",
    "public charging station , users do not have control of charging the car at each instance .",
    "they need a certain amount of energy within a deadline .",
    "it is the job of the charging station to select a price depending on the requirement at real time . in our proposed mechanism",
    ", the charging station selects different prices for different options and the user only needs to select a contract , it does not need to control the charging pattern at each instance .",
    "the commercial charging stations often have fixed number of spots . in our proposed mechanism ,",
    "the charging station can select prices to control the number of charging spots being currently used in an efficient manner .",
    "@xcite considered a competitive model where the charging stations select prices for the evs .",
    "however , in @xcite the price is considered to be fixed for each unit of charging i.e. it did not consider different prices for different users at different times and for different deadlines .",
    "the users utilities are also considered to be known to the charging stations . however , in real time , the user s utilities , deadlines may not be known to the charging station .",
    "@xcite proposed an online vcg auction mechanism .",
    "however , in @xcite the user s payment is determined at the end of the day , and thus users are not sure how much they have to pay beforehand .",
    "hence , it may not be preferred by the users .",
    "in contrast , in our mechanism we propose a readily implementable pricing scheme where prices are selected for each incoming user for various levels of energies required and deadline .",
    "the users select one of the contracts based on their utilities which are perceived in real times and pays the prescribed price . in @xcite",
    "a online scheduling algorithm has been proposed for charging evs .",
    "this paper considered that each user has a fixed charging and deadline request . upon arrival",
    "the charging station decides to admit the user or not depending on the user s utility and the cost of serving other users .",
    "however , they did not guarantee that evs get the requested amount of energy by the deadline .",
    "it proposed a penalty for those users whose requests are not completed . however , in practice it is difficult to figure out the exact penalty . additionally , since there is uncertainty that user s request may not be fulfilled , hence users may not prefer the setting .",
    "in contrast , in our model once an user opts for an option , the ev charging station always fulfills the request .",
    "thus , the penalty needs not be paid to the user .",
    "we also consider that the users may have different utility functions and those values may not be known to the charging station .",
    "further , compared to all the above papers , in our proposed pricing mechanism , we do not assume that the deadlines of the users are fixed .",
    "thus , selecting suitable prices the charging stations can facilitate use of the renewable energy and efficient use of the limited charging spots . @xcite",
    "considered a deadline differentiated pricing scheme where users select different amount of energy they will consume at different times for different prices .",
    "the above papers considered an offline or day - ahead market where the users also have to state their arrival times .",
    "however , in the real time price needs to be updated for each arriving user which can arrive at any random time .",
    "the users utilities also only depend on the total energy they receive over the entire time horizon , not specifically for each time period .",
    "hence , it is difficult to bid for energy at each and every deadline .",
    "in contrast , in our proposed mechanism , the user selects one of the contracts ; it just has to pay the prescribed price and it will receive the prescribed energy within the prescribed deadline .",
    "thus , user s decision burden is greatly reduced and the communication overhead is greatly reduced . by selecting prices for deadlines , the charging spots can be used more efficiently , and the number of charging spots can be kept minimum .",
    "further , @xcite also assumed that the price setter knows the utilities of the users and @xcite assumed that the utilities are continuous and concave .",
    "however , our pricing strategies are more general and such assumptions are not necessary .",
    "we consider a charging station which wants to select a pricing strategy in order to maximize its payoff over a certain period of time @xmath6 ( e.g. one day ) .",
    "suppose that user @xmath7 arrives at the charging station at time @xmath8 .",
    "the charging station _ provides _ a price menu @xmath9 to the user @xmath10 where user @xmath10 can consume up to @xmath11 unit of energy with the deadline @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "user @xmath10 has to decide @xmath3 and @xmath13 based on the menu ; if she decided to accept any option on the menu , she has to pay the prescribed price @xmath9 .",
    "the user can decide not to accept any price too ( fig  [ fig : ev_charging ] ) .",
    "the ev may not be charged continuously i.e. preemption is allowed .",
    "a preempted battery of the ev can be resumed charging from the previous battery level upon preemption .",
    "the charging station decides a price menu or a contract @xmath9 to user @xmath10 for different energy levels @xmath11 and deadline @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ev_charging ] ) .",
    "it is needless to say that we can discretize the time and energy at any level that one may want , however , the computational cost will increase .",
    "if user @xmath10 selects the price option @xmath9 , it will get an utility @xmath15 . hence , its _ surplus _ or payoff will be @xmath16 .",
    "if the user rejects all the options then its utility is @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ev_charging ] ) .",
    "we assume that the realized value @xmath15 is drawn from a distribution function of the random variable @xmath17 .",
    "the random variables @xmath17 need not be independent , in fact , they can be generated from a joint distribution . in practice , there is a correlation of the utilities among different deadlines and charging amount .",
    "for example , @xmath18 if @xmath19 as higher amount of energy for a fixed deadline should induce higher utility to an user .",
    "similarly , @xmath20 if @xmath21 since for a similar level of charge , the user will prefer the smaller deadline menu as it will give the user more flexibility . on the other hand , a user who wants to park a long time may not mind a longer deadline .",
    "thus , we do not make any apriori assumptions on the utility functions since they can be different for different users .",
    "we assume that the car vacates the charging spot once it exceeds its prescribed deadline .",
    "we assume that the charging station can obtain energies for fulling the charging request both from the renewable sources and conventional sources ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hybrid_source ] ) .",
    "the charging station can buy a conventional energy @xmath22 at a price @xmath23 for usage during the interval @xmath24",
    ". we do not assume any specific type of pricing schemes for buying conventional energy .",
    "more specifically , our model can accommodate fixed pricing scheme ( @xmath25 for all @xmath13 ) , or time - of - use ( tou ) pricing ( same price only for certain time blocks ) , or real time pricing ( prices can be different at different times ) .    the charging station",
    "is also equipped with an energy harvesting device and a storage capacity of @xmath26 .",
    "the harvesting device harvests @xmath27 amount of energy between @xmath24 .",
    "we assume that the marginal cost to harvest renewable energy is @xmath0 . the amount of energy that the charging station uses from the storage for the time @xmath24 be @xmath28 .",
    "the charging station must procure the @xmath3 amount of energy for user @xmath10 by time @xmath29 if the user accepts the price menu @xmath30 . let @xmath31 be the conventional energy and @xmath32 be the energy from the storage device used by the charging station to charge user @xmath10 for time interval @xmath24 . then",
    ", we must have the following constraint @xmath33 suppose that initially there is a set of users @xmath34 already present in the charging station at time @xmath8 .",
    "now , the user @xmath35 has a deadline of @xmath36 and additional demand @xmath37 .",
    "the charging station must have to satisfy the demand of those users .",
    "thus , the charging station must also satisfy @xmath38 we also assume that the charging station has one kind of charging equipment ( either slow charging or fast charging ) and there is a maximum rate constraint ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath40 since the total energy @xmath28 used for charging from the storage device and the amount of conventional energy @xmath22 bought from the market , thus , @xmath41 note that the charging station may store the unused conventional energy bought from the market i.e. @xmath42 is stored in the storage device .",
    "the charging station may buy additional amount of conventional energy at time @xmath13 , if the future prices are higher .",
    "let the battery level at time @xmath43 be @xmath44 and @xmath45 be the initial battery level .",
    "the charging station also wants to keep the battery level at the end of the day as @xmath45 .",
    "if the battery can not hold the excessive energy , then it is wasted .",
    "let use denote the wasted energy for time @xmath46 be @xmath47 , to the grid.]then @xmath48 fig .",
    "[ fig : hybrid_source ] depicts the hybrid energy source we considered .",
    "the profit of the charging station inherently depends on whether the user will accept that menu or not . hence , before how the charging station will select @xmath9 for user @xmath10 , we delve into the decision process of the users .",
    "an user selects at most one of the price menus in order to maximize its payoff or surplus .",
    "we assume that the user is a _",
    "price taker_.    thus , for a menu of prices @xmath9 , the user @xmath10 selects @xmath49 $ ] such that it maximizes the following @xmath50 note that @xmath51 only if @xmath52 .",

    "note that if the maximum payoff that user gets among all the price menus ( or , contracts ) is negative , then the user will not charge i.e. @xmath57 for all @xmath3 and @xmath13 .",
    "we also assume that if there is a tie between charging and not charging , then the user will decide to charge i.e. if the maximum payoff that user can get is @xmath0 , then the user will decide to charge . amount . ]      since the users arrive for the charging request at any time throughout the day , the charging station does not know the exact arrival times for the future vehicles .",
    "we consider that the charging station is myopic or near - sighted i.e. it selects its price for user @xmath10 without considering the future arrival process of the vehicles .",
    "however , it will consider the cost incurred to charge the existing evs .",
    "note that as the number of existing users increases , the marginal cost can increase to fulfill a contract for an arriving user , hence , such a pricing strategy may not maximize the payoff in a long run .",
    "numerically , we also show that the myopic pricing strategy is close to optimal in the long run in the above scenario .",
    "note that , _ a myopic pricing strategy is optimal in the case the marginal cost of fulfilling a demand of a new user is independent of the number of existing users .",
    "_    in practice , the charging station often has fixed number of charging spots , thus , the charging station may want to select high prices for user @xmath10 , in order to make the charging spots available for the users who can pay more but only will arrive in future .",
    "thus , considering the future arrival process of the vehicles may increase the profit of the charging station .",
    "however , such a pricing strategy is against the first come first serve basis which is the current norm for charging vehicle .",
    "our approach can be seen as a fair allocation process , where the charging station serves users based on the first come first serve basis .",
    "later in section  [ sec : simulation_results ] , we show that since the charging station can control the time spent by a ev through pricing , our approach requires lower number of charging spots compared to the existing pricing mechanism .",
    "note that if the user @xmath10 accepts the menu @xmath58 .",
    "then , the charging station needs to allocate resources among the evs in order to minimize the total cost of fulfilling the contract .",
    "first , we introduce some notations which we use throughout .",
    "[ defn : vlt ] if the user @xmath10 selects the menu @xmath58 , then the charging station has to incur the cost @xmath59 where @xmath59 is the value of the following linear optimization problem : @xmath60    note that our model can also incorporate time varying , strictly increasing convex costs @xmath61 .",
    "since @xmath62 is a linear optimization problem , it is easy to compute @xmath59 . also note that if the above problem is infeasible for some @xmath3 and @xmath13 , then we consider @xmath63 as @xmath64 .",

    "@xmath65 is the value of that optimization problem .",

    "we assume that the utilities are distributed according to some continuous distribution .",
    "hence , @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 thus , @xmath73 not only depends on @xmath9 , but also prices for other menus .",
    "we consider that the charging station decides the price menus in order to fulfill one of the two objectives ( or , both)i ) social welfare maximization and ii ) its profit maximization .",
    "the social welfare is the sum of user surplus and the profit of the charging station . as discussed in section  [ sec : userdecision ] for a certain realized values @xmath15 if the user @xmath10 selects the price menu @xmath9 , then its surplus is @xmath16 , otherwise it is @xmath0 .    as discussed in section  [ sec : profit ] the profit of the",

    "thus , the _ ex - ante _ maximization does not guarantee that the social welfare will be maximized for every realization of the random variables @xmath17 .",
    "however , in the _ ex - post _ maximization , the social welfare is maximized for each possible realization of the random variables .",

    "it is important for the wide scale deployment of the charging stations , the charging station must have some profit .",
    "further , if the charging station is operated by a private entity its objective is indeed to maximize the profit .    when the charging station is clairvoyant , then the charging station wants to maximize the profit given in ( [ eq : profit_maximum ] ) by selecting @xmath9 .",

    "hence , the total users surpluses decreases slowly in this regime .",
    "we then studied the effect of increment of @xmath5 on the profit of the charging station ( fig .",
    "[ fig : profit ] ) . as @xmath5 increases the profit increases initially .",
    "however , as @xmath138 , the number of users served decreases rapidly , hence , the profit also drops .",

    "since the average time spent by users in the charging station increases with @xmath5 and the number of admitted users are almost the same for @xmath143 , hence the number of active users increases as @xmath5 increases . though the maximum never reaches beyond @xmath144 for any value of @xmath5 .",
    "however , when @xmath137 , the number of active users decreases with @xmath5 .",
    "we also show that how our pricing algorithm lowers the maximum of active users compared to the differentiated pricing mechanism closest to our proposed in @xcite .",
    "similar to @xcite we assume that in a day - ahead setting the primary will set prices at every instance .",
    "the users will select the amount of energy to be consumed at by each time period .",
    "we assume that the utility will not charge beyond the preferred deadline and before the arrival time .",
    "our result shows that the evs tend to spend more time as it reduces the cost of buying conventional energy . additionally , the maximum of the number of the evs present at any time is also higher ( fig .  [",

    "hence , in our proposed mechanism , the charging station controls the deadlines of the evs and thus , lowers the number of active charging spots required and the time spent in the charging station .",
    "as @xmath5 increases the users only with higher utilities will accept the contracts .",
    "thus , users with higher energy demand will be more likely to accept the contract and hence , the average charging amount for each ev should increase with @xmath5 . however , fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_mean ] shows that for @xmath145 , the average energy consumed by each ev decreases with the increase in @xmath5 .",
    "the apparent anomaly is due to the fact that the users with higher demand but with smaller deadline preferences , may have to pay more because of the increase in the price to fulfill the contract as @xmath5 increases .",
    "hence , such users will not accept the offers which results into decrement of the average energy consumption with the increase in @xmath5 .",

    "however the increment is only linear .",
    "in fact for @xmath146 , the average energy consumption per ev is around @xmath121 kw - h which is in accordance with the value stated in @xcite .",
    "the cost of the ev charging station decreases with the increase in @xmath5 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : cost ] ) .",
    "since the time spent by the users increases and thus , the demand of the users can be met through renewable energies .",
    "the charging station buys lower amount of conventional energies which results into lower cost for the charging station . note that the usage of conventional energies decreases even though the total surpluses of the users is almost the same for @xmath143 .",
    "hence , for lower values of @xmath5 can increase the user s surpluses without consuming too much conventional energies which will be preferred by the regulator .      the price is higher during the peak period when the arrival rates is higher and the time - of - use price is high ( fig .",
    "[ fig : price ] ) .",
    "hence , the pricing mechanism is consistent with the ferc s objective of selecting higher prices during the peak time to flatten the demand curve .",
    "a new price is selected every - time a ev is admitted .",
    "hence , as @xmath5 decreases the admitted users is higher , hence the price variation is also higher as @xmath5 decreases .",
    "also note that when @xmath5 is in the moderate value , number of active users can be large , hence serving additional user can be significant at the peak periods as the charging station may have to buy conventional energy .",
    "hence , the price also can be high at peak periods even when @xmath5 is low .",
    "the critical challenge for an ev charging station is an online price selection mechanism which can optimize the social welfare , and profit of the charging station as well as reduce the conventional energy consumption . towards this end , we considered a novel online pricing mechanism where a charging station selects a range of prices for different charging amounts and deadlines .",
    "the decision of the users is much simplified compared to the previous proposed pricing mechanisms as the users do not have to curb its energy consumption at each instance . rather , an user only needs to select a contract based on its requirement .",
    "we also considered a hybrid energy source for the charging station which can select favorable prices for longer deadlines by leveraging on the renewable energy generation and its storage unit having limited capacity .",
    "we propose a pricing mechanism which can maximize the social welfare .",
    "however , the above pricing mechanism may not maximize the expected payoff when the charging station is _ unaware _ of the utilities of the users .",
    "we also propose a fixed profit pricing scheme which can provide higher profits to the charging station in expense of the surpluses of the users .",
    "numerically , we show that how the charging station can judiciously select the profit margin in order to balance between profit and the surpluses of the users using this pricing scheme .",
    "we also show that since the charging station controls the deadline of the evs by judiciously selecting the prices , the number of charging spots required is greatly reduced , and thus , the users which badly need the charging spots can charge their cars .",
    "we considered that the ev charging station is myopic which does not consider the future arrival process while selecting an optimal price for an incoming ev . in future",
    "we consider the case where the charging station knows the statistics of the future arrival process of the evs and selects price accordingly .",
    "we also considered that the charging station has only type of charger ( either fast or slow ) , the characterization of prices when the charging station selects prices for different chargers is also left for the future .",

    "more specifically , the user selects the menu @xmath150 if @xmath191 and @xmath195 without loss of generality , assume that @xmath196 be the maximum value for which the above inequality is satisfied i.e. @xmath197 the random variable @xmath117 only affects the probability whether @xmath198 or not .",
    "hence , the charging station s expected profit is upper bounded by @xmath199 note that by the definition of @xmath111 ( definition  [ defn : alpha ] ) , @xmath200 however by theorem  [ thm : expected_payoff ] the expected payoff of the charging station when it selects the price @xmath201 is given by the expression in the left hand of the expression in ( [ eq : compare ] ) .",
    "hence , this leads to a contradiction .",
    "thus , the result follows ."
