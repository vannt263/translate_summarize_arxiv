    "galaxies may be broadly divided into two categories : those that are forming stars fairly rapidly relative to their past averaged star formation rate ( sfr ) , and those that show little recent star formation relative to their past average .",
    "it is well known that , at least at low redshift ( @xmath0 ) , the former type tend to have blue colours and to be morphologically disk dominated , while the latter tend to have red colours and to be morphologically early type or spheroid dominated .",
    "galaxies exhibit colour bimodalities throughout a wide range of cosmic history @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental questions in galaxy formation is : what are the main physical forces that regulate and in some cases quench star formation ? are these processes more closely correlated with _",
    "internal galaxy properties _ such as mass or luminosity , or _ large scale environment",
    "_ ( sometimes referred to as `` nature or nurture '' ) ?    there have been many studies on the impact of environment on galaxy properties .",
    "for example , @xcite and many others found that early - type galaxies are more strongly clustered than the late - types , and @xcite systematically demonstrated that the fraction of elliptical and s0 galaxies is higher in denser environments .",
    "similarly , it is well known that galaxies in dense environments tend to be red and to have depressed star formation rates @xcite .",
    "there are several physical processes associated with environment that may play a role in galaxy transformation .",
    "major ( near equal - mass ) mergers can transform spiral galaxies into ellipticals ( @xcite ; cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and may also quench future star formation by ejecting the ism from the galaxy via starburst , agn , or shock - driven winds @xcite .",
    "in rich clusters , where the probability of merging is suppressed because of the large relative velocities of galaxies , galaxy `` harrassment '' ( rapid encounters or fly - bys ) may cause a less dramatic form of transformation by heating disks , perhaps causing the formation of a bar and growth of a spheroidal component @xcite .",
    "also , cold gas can be stripped out of the galaxy both by tidal forces due to the background dark matter dominated potential of the cluster , and due to ram pressure stripping by the intracluster medium @xcite .",
    "similarly , the hot halo that provides future fuel for cooling and star formation may be efficiently stripped in dense environments , thus quenching further star formation by `` starvation '' or `` strangulation '' @xcite .",
    "however , studies by @xcite and @xcite suggest that processes specific to clusters ( e.g. ram - pressure stripping ) are not the main mechanisms for quenching star - formation activity .",
    "similar results were also found at higher redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . moreover ,",
    "both the morphological and spectrophotometric characteristics of galaxies are also known to be strongly correlated with their internal properties , such as luminosity , mass , and internal velocity @xcite .",
    "more massive or luminous galaxies are more likely to be spheroid dominated , to be red , and to have old stellar populations and little recent star formation .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed that galaxies appear to make a transition in all of these properties above a critical stellar mass of @xmath1 .",
    "again , there are various physical processes that one might expect to imprint this kind of dependence on internal properties .",
    "supernova feedback has long been invoked as a mechanism that could heat and drive gas out of galaxies @xcite , and is expected to be more effective in low - mass galaxies",
    ". there is also mounting observational evidence that agn are associated with the quenching of star formation @xcite .",
    "agn feedback is expected to have more impact on massive galaxies , which host larger mass black holes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the emerging picture is that agn seem to have two modes of fueling and also to couple to their surroundings in different ways .",
    "`` bright mode '' agn are associated with high ( near eddington ) fueling rates , and observationally with classical x - ray or optically bright quasars .",
    "the radiation emitted by these objects can couple with the cold gas in the galaxy , perhaps driving powerful winds that can drive the gas out of the galaxy and quench star formation @xcite .",
    "in contrast , many massive galaxies seem to contain agn which are accreting at a small fraction of their eddington rate , and which typically do not show classical quasar - like signatures such as bright x - ray radiation or broad emission lines .",
    "however , these objects are associated with the efficient production of radio jets , which may be able to couple to and heat the hot gas in the galaxy s halo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these objects are often referred to as `` radio mode '' agn @xcite .",
    "this process is expected to be a function both of internal properties and environment : the bigger the black hole , the more energy can be tapped ( and black hole mass is of course correlated with galaxy mass ) , and empirically it is known that the fraction of radio - detected galaxies increases strongly with stellar mass @xcite and halo mass @xcite .",
    "but as well , the radio jets must have a `` working surface '' and therefore can only be effective in environments that can support a quasi - hydrostatic hot gas halo , such as groups and clusters .",
    "galaxies in smaller mass halos ( @xmath2 ) likely accrete most of their gas in a `` cold flow '' , and never form a hot halo @xcite .",
    "a great deal of recent progress has been made towards developing a comprehensive theory of galaxy formation .",
    "the semi - analytic approach , although it has its limitations , is a powerful and flexible tool for exploring detailed predictions based on this theor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several groups have now implemented one or both modes of black hole growth and agn feedback into their semi - analytic models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there seems to be consensus that including these new processes leads to greatly improved agreement with key observations such as galaxy luminosity or mass functions , and the galaxy colour - magnitude distribution or stellar mass vs. specific star formation distribution .",
    "however , this necessitates including several new recipes and parameters associated with the poorly understood physics of black hole growth and agn feedback .",
    "each model contains somewhat different parameterizations and treatments of these processes , yet they all produce similar results for global quantities such as the galaxy luminosity function and colour - magnitude distribution , no doubt in part because these observations were `` targets '' that the modellers were trying to reproduce .",
    "one goal of our work here is to determine whether breaking down the fraction of quenched galaxies in the dual space of internal galaxy properties and environment can discriminate between these different treatments of agn feedback .",
    "the large and homegeneous databases provided by modern surveys , such as sdss and galex , finally allow a statistically significant investigation of different sub - populations of galaxies .",
    "however , an obvious question that arises in any study of galaxy environment is exactly how to measure and characterize environment in observational samples .",
    "clearly , it is desirable to span as broad a range of environments as possible , from isolated field galaxies to groups to rich clusters .",
    "the majority of the studies in the literature have parameterised environment in terms of the number of galaxies , either within a fixed metric aperture , or by the distance of the @xmath3th - nearest galaxy , where @xmath3 is typically in the range 310 .",
    "although these indicators are straightforward to measure , they are not straightforward to interpret in physical terms or to compare with theoretical models ( see discussions in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "an alternate approach is to use a galaxy group catalogue , in which galaxies in an observational catalog are not only grouped together into putatively gravitationally bound structures , but also the total mass of their associated dark matter halo is estimated ( yang et al .",
    "thus , the relationship between galaxy properties and dark matter halo properties can be studied directly .",
    "another advantage of this method is that galaxies can be separated into `` central '' and `` satellite '' populations .",
    "most of the environment - related tranformation mechanisms described above ( such as stripping ) are expected to work only on satellite galaxies , so this offers a way to separate out the effects of different physical processes .    here",
    "we make use of a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the sdss using the halo - based galaxy group finder developed by @xcite .",
    "these catalogues have already been used for several studies regarding the environment dependence of galaxy properties .",
    "@xcite , using the version based on the sdss dr2 , studied the correlations between colours , specific star formation rate and halo mass . splitting the galaxy population into early and late types , based on their colours and specific star formation rates , they found that , at a fixed luminosity , the late ( early ) type fraction of galaxies increases ( decreases ) with decreasing halo mass . using the much larger galaxy group catalogue of yang et al .",
    "( 2007 ; hereafter y07 ) , based on the sdss dr4 , @xcite showed that , on average , satellite galaxies are redder and more concentrated than central galaxies of the same stellar mass .",
    "they also found that the colour and concentration differences of central - satellite pairs matched in stellar mass are completely independent of the mass of the host halo of the satellite galaxy .",
    "this indicates that satellite - specific transformation mechanisms are equally efficient in host haloes of all masses and rules against satellite transformation mechanisms that are thought to operate only in very massive haloes .",
    "further support for this was provided by @xcite and @xcite , who showed that , at fixed stellar mass , the average colours and concentrations , as well as the occurrence of star formation and agn activity , reveal only a very weak dependence on halo mass ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite compared the fractions of red and blue galaxies in the sdss group catalogue of @xcite with the semi - analytic model of galaxy formation of @xcite .",
    "although this model accurately fits the global statistics of the galaxy population , the model predicts a red fraction of satellites that is much higher than observed ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    "we extend the study of @xcite using the much larger galaxy group catalogue of y07 and a larger suite of semi - analytic models .",
    "another new aspect of our work here is that we augment the sdss - based galaxy properties in the group catalogue with information derived from the galex - sdss matched sample of salim et al .",
    "( 2007 ; hereafter s07 ) .",
    "the s07 analysis provides complementary quantities such as stellar masses and star formation rates based on the two galex uv bands plus five - band sdss photometry .",
    "the uv provides a much more sensitive probe of the recent star formation history of a galaxy than optical colours alone , which reflect the highly degenerate effects of stellar populations , metallicity , and dust extinction @xcite .",
    "in addition , the uv can provide reliable measures of sfr for galaxies with weak or undetected emission lines .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate the dependence of the fraction of quenched galaxies on galaxy properties and dm halo mass in both the observational group catalogue and in several different semi - analytic galaxy formation models .",
    "another new aspect of our study with respect to previous comparisons ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is that we compare with the results from three independently developed semi - analytic codes , and for one of the codes , we examine three different variants with different physical ingredients . in this way",
    ", we investigate how these empirical results can constrain the input physics in these kinds of models .",
    "an outline of the rest of our paper is as follows : in  2 , we describe the empirical data sets and the group catalogues used in our study ; in  3 we describe the theoretical models ; in  4 we present the results of our comparisons between the empirical data and the models ; we discuss our results and conclude in  5 .",
    "we make use of the galaxy group catalog of yang et al .",
    "( 2007 ; y07 ) .",
    "the catalogue was constructed by applying the halo - based group finder of @xcite to the new york university value - added galaxy catalog ( nyu - vagc , @xcite ) , which is based on the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 4 ( dr4 ; @xcite ) . from the main galaxy sample , y07 selected galaxies with extinction - corrected @xmath4-band apparent magnitude brighter than @xmath5 , within a redshift range @xmath6 , and with a redshift completeness @xmath7 .",
    "they augmented this sample with 7091 galaxies with @xmath8 with redshifts from alternate sources . the resulting sample ( sample ii of y07 )",

    "stellar masses are computed using the relation between rest - frame optical colour and mass - to - light ratio of @xcite , as specified in y07 , assuming a kroupa imf .",
    "our sample is not volume limited , and we therefore attempt to correct for the resulting malmquist bias by weighting each galaxy by a standard @xmath12 correction @xcite .",
    "the group finder first identifies a potential group centre by the friends - of - friends algorithm @xcite , and then computes the characteristic luminosity of each tentative group .",
    "the characteristic group luminosity is defined as the ( incompleteness corrected ; see y07 ) combined luminosity of all group members with @xmath13 .",
    "the characteristic group stellar mass is similarly the incompleteness - corrected total stellar mass contributed by galaxies with @xmath14 .",
    "then , the velocity dispersion and the virial radius of the dark matter halo ( dmh ) associated with each tentative group are estimated iteratively , assuming a constant mass - to - light ratio as an initial guess .",
    "these two estimates can be used for determining the spherical @xcite ( nfw)-type dark matter profile . assuming a gaussian probability distribution along the redshift direction and a projected spherical nfw dark matter profile for the perpendicular plane , group members are updated until there is no change in their memberships .",
    "lastly , a dmh mass is assigned to each group , assuming a one - to - one correlation between the characteristic stellar mass for each group and the halo mass derived from a theoretical mass function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we use the halo mass estimated from stellar mass , as luminosity - based halo mass estimates may be biased differently for groups with blue vs. red galaxies ( y07 ) .",

    "each generation of stars produces a fixed `` yield '' of metals , which are deposited in the cold gas .",
    "this gas may then be ejected and mixed with the hot component by supernova or agn driven winds .    when a satellite is subsumed into a larger dark matter halo , it is assumed that it immediately loses its hot gas halo , and thus does not receive any new supply of cold gas .",

    ", the black hole grows at its eddington rate until it reaches a critical mass .",
    "the critical mass is that at which the energy radiated by the black hole is sufficient to halt further accretion , i.e. , the black hole growth is self - regulated @xcite .",
    "soon after reaching the critical mass , the black hole enters a `` blowout '' phase , resulting in a decline in the accretion rate .",
    "the associated radiation can also drive winds that remove cold gas from the galaxy ( see s08 for details ) .",
    "the s08 models also incorporate `` radio mode '' feedback associated with low - efficiency accretion .",
    "the accretion rate is computed using the isothermal bondi flow model of @xcite . in the presence of a quasi - hydrostatic shock - heated gas halo , the energy from this accretion",
    "is assumed to drive radio jets that can heat the gas and partially or completely offset the cooling flow .",
    "the resulting star formation and enrichment histories are convolved with the stellar population models of @xcite to compute magnitudes and colours .",
    "we have adopted a chabrier imf .",
    "the impact of dust extinction is modelled using an analytic model , as in @xcite .",
    "the s08 _ fiducial model _ includes all of these mechanisms .",
    "we also consider a `` no agn feedback model '' , which does not include either the bright mode or radio mode agn feedback mechanisms , and the `` halo quenching '' model , in which cooling is shut off when a halo grows more massive than @xmath25 ( see table 1 for a summary of all models ) .",
    "the halo quenching model is included as an illustration of a quenching mechanism that has a simple dependence on halo mass only . a similar model has been considered by @xcite . it is based on the ideas proposed by @xcite and @xcite , who suggest that whenever a halo grows above this critical quenching mass , the gas is shock - heated to near the virial temperature , and can be easily kept hot either by an agn or by other processes such as heating by gas clumps or orbiting satellites @xcite .",
    "we also consider two additional models from other groups in this study . the de lucia et al .",
    "( 2006 , hereafter dl06 ) models contain similar ingredients to the s08 models , with the following differences .",
    "they are based on merger trees extracted from the millennium n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "unlike in the models of s08 , they do not include the effects of adiabatic contraction and an nfw halo profile in their estimates of galaxy sizes , which leads to a different evolution in the star formation rates and gas fractions in their models .",
    "they use somewhat different ( though similar in spirit ) recipes for star formation and supernova feedback , and they use a different approach for modelling black hole growth ( though , like s08 , they assume that `` bright mode '' black hole growth is triggered by mergers )",
    ". they do not include `` bright mode '' agn feedback ( agn - driven winds ) , and their treatment of the radio mode feedback is again similar in spirit but different in detail from s08 .",
    "magnitudes and colours ( including dust extinction ) are computed in a similar manner to s08 , and use a chabrier imf .",
    "we obtained the dl06 catalogs from the public millennium database ( http://www.g-vo.org/millennium ) .",
    "we also consider the predictions of the semi - analytic model morgana @xcite .",
    "morgana follows a scheme similar to s08 and dl06 , but it includes a different treatment for the thermal processes acting on baryonic gas .",
    "more details on the updated version we use in this paper are presented in lo faro et al .",
    "( 2008 , in prep ) .",
    "the model is based on merger trees obtained using the pinocchio method @xcite , similar to those predicted by n - body simulations .",
    "gas cooling and infall follow the prescription described and tested in @xcite , while star formation and stellar feedback are then modeled as in @xcite .",
    "when two dm halos merge , dynamical friction , tidal stripping and tidal shocks on the satellite galaxies are followed using the @xcite formulation .",
    "similarly to s08 , when a satellite dm halo merges into a larger one , all of its hot gas is shock heated according to the new halo potential and gets removed from the satellite ( thus implying that the corresponding satellite galaxy does not receive any further cold gas supply ) .",
    "disc sizes are computed using the model of @xcite , and bulge sizes are computed assuming that kinetic energy is conserved in mergers .",
    "a key ingredient in morgana is the inclusion of a self - consistent model for the accretion of gas onto supermassive black holes and the resulting agn feedback modes ( following @xcite and @xcite , see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "this modeling assumes that the loss of angular momentum is the main regulator of black hole accretion .",
    "this is triggered by the presence of gas in the bulge component , and the almost complete loss of angular momentum of accreted gas is related to star formation activity . following @xcite ,",
    "star formation creates a reservoir of low angular momentum gas which is then accreted at a rate regulated by the viscous accretion time scale or by the eddington limit .",
    "the nature of feedback from the agn depends on the accretion rate in eddington units : whenever this is higher than 0.01 ( `` bright mode '' ) , the agn can trigger a massive galactic - scale wind ( see * ? ? ? * ) which leads to the complete removal of the ism from the galaxy , while at lower accretion rates ( `` radio mode '' ) the energy is ejected through jets that feed back on the hot halo gas with an efficiency that scales with @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the halo circular velocity . as a consequence",
    ", bh accretion requires some star formation to be triggered , and feedback follows the onset of cooling only after some time .",
    "the ejected energy heats the hot halo gas component and quenches the cooling flow .",
    "galaxy seds , magnitudes and colours are obtained using the grasil spectro - photometric code with radiative transfer for computing the effect of dust @xcite .    in table 1",
    ", we present a brief description of each model .",
    "in this section , we investigate the joint dependence of star formation quenching on _ stellar mass _ and _ halo mass _ , in order to try to contrain the physical mechanisms that are responsible for quenching .",
    "we make use of two indicators of quenched star formation : red optical colours , and low specific star formation rates ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "red optical colours are frequently used to isolate `` quenched '' galaxies ; however , a red optical colour can arise from a degenerate combination of an old stellar population , a high metallicity , or strong dust extinction .",
    "ssfr based on uv - optical data are a more sensitive probe of recent star formation .    in order to mimic the selection effects of the flux - limited observational sample , we first assign redshifts to all the model galaxies by placing an `` observer '' in a corner of the simulation box .",
    "we apply the same flux limit used in the observational catalogs to the models by selecting only galaxies with apparent @xmath4-band magnitude @xmath29 .",
    "we then apply the @xmath30 weighting factor , just as we do with the galaxies in the observational sample .",
    "then , we exclude all halos that do not contain any galaxy brighter than @xmath31 , as these halos would not be included in the group catalog .",
    "we apply these selection criteria for all of the model - data comparisons shown in the main text , unless otherwise noted .",
    "we also present our main results for the models without these selection criteria in the appendix .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : colourmag ] , we present the global colour - magnitude relations ( cmrs ) at @xmath11 for the observations and theoretical models , along with the dividing line between the observed red sequence and the blue cloud ( sometimes called the `` green valley '' ) . in this figure , we show the results for the whole sdss sample , regardless of inclusion in the group catalog , and similarly we have not applied the observational selection criteria to the theoretical models .",
    "the magnitudes and colours are shown in the rest - frame @xmath11 system defined by @xcite .",
    "for the dl06 models , we used the observed frame magnitudes at @xmath11 , converted to absolute magnitudes . for the morgana galaxies ,",
    "we compute the absolute @xmath11 magnitudes from the corresponding synthetic spectra .",
    "for the s08 models , when we computed standard @xmath32 frame colours and magnitudes , we produced a good match to the observed colour - magnitude relation expressed in the @xmath33 frame .",
    "however , when we computed the @xmath11 system colours as described in @xcite , we found it necessary to apply a shift of 0.05 magnitudes to the @xmath34 colour to match the location of the observed @xmath11 system red sequence .",
    "this is indicative of small differences in the shape of the sed s in the semi - analytic models from the synthetic sed s used by @xcite for computing the k - corrections .",
    "it should also be noted that details in the population synthesis prescriptions , such as chemical enrichment and dust extinction , may also cause noticeable differences in colours ( see appendix for the effect of dust ) .",
    "therefore , reproducing the cmr quantitatively in semi - analytic models is quite challenging .",
    "the observations clearly show the familiar red sequence and blue cloud , and these features are reproduced reasonably well in all of the theoretical models , except the s08 no - agn - feedback model . as has been pointed out before ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , semi - analytic models without some kind of suppression of cooling in massive halos , e.g. by agn feedback , predict that massive galaxies are still accreting plenty of cold gas at the present day , and therefore are star - forming and blue , in conflict with observations .",
    "we do see subtle differences in the structure of the cm distribution for the different models , for example , the s08-halo - quenching model produces very few low - luminosity red galaxies , and the dl06 model produces a very strong bimodality .",
    "also , we notice that the red sequence in the halo - quenching model is slightly bluer compared with the s08 fiducial model .",
    "this is because the central galaxies in the halo - quenching model stop forming stars once their halo becomes more massive as @xmath35 . in general",
    ", this happens at an earlier epoch than the `` radio mode '' feedback is able to quench star formation .",
    "because chemical evolution is also halted when star formation is quenched , the massive galaxies in the halo - quenching model do not become as enriched as do the galaxies in the fiducial model ( see s08 ) .",
    "we could have adjusted for this by increasing the chemical yield , but we chose to leave all the free parameters fixed in both models to allow a direct comparison .    the behavior of morgana is somewhat different from that of the other models .",
    "a clear red sequence is present at intermediate and faint magnitudes , but it fades away at bright magnitudes , in contrast to the observations .",
    "luminous galaxies tend to be blue .",
    "we interpret this result as an inefficient quenching of star formation through `` radio - mode '' feedback in morgana .",
    "in fact , as explained in  .",
    "[ sec : models ] , in this model the agn heating switches on only after some cooled gas has already started forming stars in the host galaxy . obviously the residual activity is stronger for longer time delays between the onset of cooling flows and the accretion onto the central black hole . on the other hand",
    ", the blue cloud seems depleted .",
    "as shown in fontanot et al .",

    "however , we shall see later that morgana also produces too few low mass blue central galaxies .",
    "this is likely due to strong supernova feedback .                    given the strongly bimodal colour distribution exhibited by both the empirical data and most of the models , it is natural to define a dividing line between the two populations , and to investigate the fraction of galaxies in the red population , , as representing quenched objects .",

    "however , sfr estimates from emission lines , which were used by w06a , trace only very recent star formation , whereas the uv used here traces star formation over a longer timescale ( @xmath17 1 gyr ) . therefore our `` passive '' sample is not directly comparable to that of w06a , though the results are qualitatively similar .",
    "the amount of uv flux in the passive galaxies is very small and can still be consistent with the amount of uv flux that can be produced by old stars such as low - mass horizontal - branch stars ( see @xcite for details ) . in this regard",
    "it is justifiable to call them `` passive '' .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ssfr ] , we see a well - defined `` star - forming sequence '' that produces the blue sequence in the traditional cm diagram , but the `` quenched '' population that produces the tight red sequence is quite spread out in ssfr .",
    "this is simply a reflection of the relative insensitivity of optical colours to small amounts of recent star formation .",
    "the precise values of ssfr at low levels of star formation can not be estimated very accurately from the data , and therefore one should not take too seriously the position of the quenched galaxies in the ssfr vs.  plot .",
    "again , the models with agn feedback ( or halo quenching ) qualitatively reproduce the empirical distribution reasonably well , but show some interesting differences .",
    "the dl06 model has a strongly - bimodal distribution of ssfr , with most galaxies living either on the star - forming sequence or being completely quenched .",

    ", there is _ too high _ a fraction of blue galaxies in the morgana model and the s08 no - agn - feedback model .",
    "we can see by comparing the s08 no - agn - feedback model with the fiducial model that agn feedback does not affect galaxy colours below stellar masses of @xmath45 ; therefore _ the excess of low - mass red satellites is not connected with agn feedback . _    the conclusions we would draw from the comparison with  are qualitatively similar , though quantitatively somewhat different .",
    "for example , the dl06 model shows a better quantitative match to the  data than to  for central galaxies .",
    "the s08 fiducial and halo - quenching models produced almost indistinguishable results for ( ) , but significantly different results for ( ) . this is due to the age - metallicity degeneracy  as we discussed in  [ sec : global ] , massive galaxies in the halo - quenching model are more metal poor than in the fiducial model .",
    "therefore , although they are older ( as seen in the  diagram ) , their optical colours are similar .",
    "similarly , the large difference between  and  for the s08 no agn - feedback model is due to dust extinction : in this model , massive galaxies are actively star forming , and therefore extremely dusty ( see appendix for more discussion of the effects of dust extinction ) .    the somewhat lower fraction of red / passive satellite galaxies in the s08 models is due to the inclusion of tidal destruction , which is not included in the dl06 or morgana models . in the s08 model , satellites that orbit within their host halo for a long time can eventually become tidally destroyed , and their stars are added to a `` diffuse stellar halo '' ( see s08 ) .",
    "naturally , in the absence of tidal destruction , these satellites exhaust all of their gas and become very red .",
    "however , we see here that although the inclusion of tidal destruction helps reduce the excess of low - mass red satellites in the models , a significant discrepancy still remains .    one might then wonder whether increasing the efficiency of tidal destruction could completely solve the satellite over - quenching problem that we see here .",
    "we do not believe that this is a viable solution , for several reasons .",
    "first , the tidal disruption model used by s08 was tuned to match the sub - structure mass function for very high - resolution n - body simulations .",
    "s08 also showed that their models correctly reproduce the total number of low - mass galaxies ( i.e. the faint end slope of the stellar mass function ) , although the model overproduces low - mass bulge - dominated ( red / passive ) galaxies and underproduces low - mass disc - dominated ( blue / active ) galaxies .",
    "significantly increasing the efficiency of tidal destruction would be in conflict with the n - body results and would also produce an overall deficit of low - mass galaxies .",
    "put another way , tidal destruction can remove low - mass red satellites but can not increase the number of low - mass blue satellites .      in this section",

    "the models showed quite a different pattern in this space , and tended to show stronger vertical boundaries , indicating a stronger dependence on halo mass .",
    "for both the empirical data and the models , these diagrams demonstrate the complexity of the interplay between halo mass and stellar mass , and are a promising tool for posing stringent tests on physical recipes in galaxy formation models . however , we caution that the estimates of halo mass in the sdss group catalogs are statistical in nature , and this may introduce distortions into these distributions ( see appendix ) .",
    "we attempted to probe the physical origin of these results by exploring additional correlations , such as the fraction of morphologically early type ( spheroid dominated ) galaxies in the observed sample , .",
    "we found a strikingly similar pattern for  in the ( , ) plane as we did for  and , suggesting that these quantities are tightly linked in some way .",
    "one natural possibility is that the bulge mass is correlated with the mass of a supermassive black hole , and that the black hole mass in turn controls the quenching of star formation .",
    "intriguingly , we found that in the models with black hole - regulated agn heating ( s08 fiducial and dl06 ) , the galaxies that were most likely to be blue , actively star forming , and disk dominated , were expected to be those with the smallest black hole for their mass .",
    "in addition , we saw a trend with halo mass , in the sense that central galaxies in larger mass halos are able to grow black holes more efficiently ( the ratio of black hole mass to stellar mass is larger ) .",
    "these trends were much weaker or absent in models in which the black hole is not involved in regulating cooling ( such as the `` halo quenching '' model ) .",
    "we do not have direct estimates of black hole masses for large samples of galaxies , but we used the measured sdss velocity dispersion @xmath67 and the observed @xmath65 relation to obtain estimates of a black hole mass proxy , @xmath64 .",
    "we do not see a strong trend in @xmath71 for the sdss group catalog , indicating either that this method for estimating the empirical black hole masses is too crude , or that the dependence of black hole mass on halo mass in the models is too strong .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although it will be important to explore the explicit predictions of alternate heating mechanisms ( such as heating by clumps or infalling satellites ) in detail .",
    "the morgana model suffers from the largest disagreement with the observations .",
    "the treatment of the triggering of `` radio mode '' accretion in morgana is significantly different than in the other two models , requiring that star formation is inevitably associated with the triggering of radio mode accretion . although the radio mode feedback mechanism adopted in morgana is largely able to solve the `` overcooling problem '' in terms of reproducing the galaxy stellar mass or luminosity function , this star formation makes many massive galaxies too blue .",
    "our analysis places tight constraints on the links between star formation and agn activity at late times , and highlights our current lack of understanding of the details of the processes that regulate both kinds of activity .    for satellite galaxies ,",
    "the empirical diagrams suggested that quenching depends on _ both _ stellar mass and halo mass , such that the `` critical stellar mass '' that divides active from passive ( blue from red ) galaxies decreases with increasing halo mass .",
    "none of the models was successful in predicting this trend . including tidal destruction of satellites , as was done in the s08 models ,",
    "improves the agreement with the data because satellites that have been orbiting for a long time within the host halo ( which tend to be red and passive ) are destroyed .",
    "however , it seems that tidal destruction can not provide a full solution to the problem .",
    "the problems with over - quenching of satellites in semi - analytic models have been demonstrated before ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are likely due to the assumption applied in nearly all sams that the hot gas halo , which is the source of new cooling gas , is stripped off instantly when a galaxy becomes a satellite in a larger halo ( sometimes called `` strangulation '' ) .",
    "therefore satellites fairly quickly consume their remaining cold gas reservoirs and become red and passive ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , recent hydrodynamic simulations have found that the hot gas halos of satellites are not stripped instantly @xcite .",
    "recently , several authors @xcite have proposed improved recipes for the treatment of cooling onto satellites , which produce better results for the predictions of satellite colours .",
    "clearly , our analysis should be repeated with one of these improved treatments implemented in our models .",

    "all of our models include a treatment of dust extinction , which affects both the colours and magnitudes of the model galaxies .",

    "we include only galaxies with apparent @xmath4-band magnitude brighter than 17.77 mags , and we also excluded halos which do not contain any galaxy member brighter than @xmath14 . in this appendix",
    "we provide the results for the 2-d distributions of  and  for the theoretical models without dust extinction and without selection criteria applied .",
    "in addition , we test for possible biases that may arise from the approach used to assign halo masses to the groups in the sdss group catalogs by applying this method to the model mock catalogs .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fred2d_nodust ] we show  and  without any  dust corrections applied to the models .",
    "since we do not have magnitude information without dust corrections for the dl06 models , only the s08 fiducial and morgana models are shown .",
    "interestingly , the results now look much more similar to the results seen before for . in particular , the blue ridge which was visible in the  diagrams",
    "corresponded to a _ red _ ridge in the  diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fred2d ] ) .",
    "the blue ridge is now visible in  as well , indicating that these galaxies are actually actively star forming , and were predicted to be red only because of dust extinction . in the case of , the dust correction only affects the galaxy selection and causes a negligible change in the diagrams .",
    "the treatment of dust extinction is one of the most uncertain aspects of the modelling , and this highlights the advantage of using intrinsic physical quantities extracted from the observations .",
    "[ fig : fred2d_noselec ] shows the model predictions with no selection effects applied . comparing this with fig .",
    "[ fig : fred2d ] , we see that the results appear unchanged above a halo mass @xmath72 and a stellar mass @xmath73 .",
    "this is reassuring in the context of our present analysis .",
    "however , we can also see that there is interesting predicted behavior at lower halo and galaxy masses than we can currently probe , and also interesting differences between the models at these masses .",
    "this suggests that it would be extremely useful to obtain similar data that are complete to fainter levels , so that we could probe lower mass galaxies and lower mass halos .",
    "finally , we investigate the procedure used to assign halo masses to the groups that are identified in the sdss group catalog . for the results presented here , stellar masses for several models are obtained from @xcite like y07 , and halo masses are assigned based on the `` characteristic '' stellar mass of the group , where the characteristic stellar mass is defined as the total stellar mass contributed by galaxies with @xmath14 .",
    "halo masses are then assigned by matching the rank - ordered list of group characteristic stellar masses with a rank - ordered list of dark matter halo masses from a theoretical estimate of the dm halo mass function , assuming a monotonic mapping between the characteristic stellar mass and dm halo mass ( see  [ sec : data : group ] and y07 ) .",
    "we apply this procedure to the halos in the mock catalog produced with the s08 fiducial semi - analytic model , and show the comparison between the true and estimated halo mass in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhalocomp ] .",
    "we see that although the mean halo mass is estimated fairly accurately , there is a large scatter in true halo mass at a given value of the estimated halo mass .    .",
    "we present the results for central galaxies ( left ) and satellite ( right ) galaxies seperately .",
    "we see that the procedure used to assign halo masses in the sdss group catalogs reduces the scatter in  at fixed halo mass , and washes out many of the detailed features of the 2d distribution that are visible in the raw model predictions . ,",
    "width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fred2d_yang ] , we show again the distribution of  with halo mass and stellar mass , now using the y07-like halo mass estimates for the semi - analytic models instead of the true halo masses .",
    "we see that the procedure artificially reduces the scatter in  at fixed halo mass .",
    "this can be attributed to two effects .",
    "first , the halo mass estimates in the y07 group catalogue are based on the total stellar mass in the halo , which strongly correlates with the stellar mass of the central galaxy . in addition",
    ", the y07 group catalogue includes corrections for various incompleteness effects in the sdss ( the factor c in eqs .",
    "34 in y07 ) , which creates scatter that is not visible in the mock catalogues .",
    "it should also be noted that the halo - mass estimating algorithm of y07 washes out many of the detailed features that are visible in the model predictions .",
    "hence we should not make too much of the detailed features in the empirical -  diagrams but should focus on the mean trends instead ."
