    "a number of observational tests strongly suggest that the universe is flat and the cosmological energy density includes a component that is not associated with matter  baryonic or dark .",
    "results from distance measurements of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) combined with cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) observations @xcite and dynamic estimates of the quantity of matter in the universe seem to indicate that the simple picture provided by standard cold dark matter scenario is not enough @xcite .",
    "these observations are often explained by introducing a new hypothetical energy component , usually referred to as dark energy , with negative pressure .",
    "the dark energy is described by an ` equation of state ' parameter @xmath5 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "since gravitational lensing takes place over cosmological distances , it can be used to measure the cosmological parameters .",
    "various aspects of gravitational lensing have been studied and their use to probe the geometry and constitution of the universe has been investigated .",
    "the frequency of multiply imaged quasars is a sensitive function of the cosmological constant @xmath8 and therefore the observed abundance of lensed quasars has been used to place upper bounds on @xmath8 ( turner 1990 @xcite , fukugita et al .",
    "1992 @xcite , kochanek 1996 @xcite ) .",
    "the relation between the image separation @xmath9 and the source redshift @xmath10 of multiply imaged quasars mostly depends on the sum of the matter density @xmath6 and vacuum energy density @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the present density of the @xmath13 component of the energy density relative to the present critical density ; @xmath14 ) , and thus serves as a good indicator of the curvature of the universe .",
    "this aspect has been studied by turner , ostriker & gott 1984 @xcite gott , park & lee 1989 @xcite , fukugita et al .",
    "1992 @xcite , park & gott 1997 @xcite , williams @xcite ( 1997 ) and more recently by helbig ( 1998)@xcite .",
    "likelihood analysis of the flux limited samples ( established by kochanek 1996 @xcite ) is another way of obtaining constraints on the cosmological parameters .",
    "this method has been used extensively in recent times by many authors to find the permissible range of the parameters of the cosmological models ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "image separation distribution function @xmath15 has been used to study constraints on the cosmological parameters as well as on the properties of the galaxies @xcite .",
    "yet another aspect of gravitational lensing statistics is the study of the mean image separation .",
    "gott , park & lee ( 1989 ) @xcite studied the mean image separation of images in cosmological models with a non - zero cosmological constant .",
    "lee & park ( 1994 ) ( hereafter lp ) @xcite , working with a sample of five multiply imaged quasars , used statistical methods to predict the best fit model .",
    "their choice of models was restricted to six different combinations of parameters ( @xmath6,@xmath11 ) .    in this work ,",
    "we exploit the angular image separation of lensed quasars in two different ways to constrain the @xmath16 and @xmath5 :    \\(i ) we develop the image separation distribution function @xmath17 of the multiply imaged lensed radio sources as a tool to perform quantitative analysis for finding the constraints on the cosmological parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we perform the chi - square test to put bounds on the parameters .",
    "\\(ii ) we calculate the expected value of the angular separation of a lensed radio source , @xmath18 by averaging @xmath19 over the probability distribution function for its given redshift @xmath10 , flux @xmath20 and redshift of the lensing galaxy @xmath21 . to estimate the significance of the difference between the predicted and the observed @xmath9 , we once again apply the chi - square test .",
    "radio source samples have several advantages over the optical quasar samples @xcite .",
    "radio - selected sources are immune to extinction in the lens galaxy .",
    "they are also free from the systematic errors arising due to the fact that the lens galaxy has an apparent brightness comparable to that of the lensed images of the source .",
    "the resolution is much smaller than the typical image separation .",
    "the parent catalogues are in the form of large - area surveys from which unbiased samples can be selected and relatively easily observed .",
    "the cosmic lens all sky survey ( class ) has resulted in the largest sample of radio sources suitable for statistical analysis @xcite .",
    "we adopt the class statistical sample for our analyses .",
    "the sample consists of 8958 radio sources out of which 13 sources are multiply imaged .",
    "the sample had been selected so as to meet well defined observational selection criteria ( see browne et al.(2002 ) ) .",
    "the statistical properties of gravitational lensing statistics are sensitive to the properties of galaxies ( lenses ) and the sources .",
    "it is thus important to use reliable galaxy luminosity functions ( lfs ) in the analysis of statistical lensing .",
    "we use the luminosity functions ( lfs ) for the early - type galaxies ( i.e. ellipticals and s0 galaxies ) and for the late - type galaxies ( i.e. spirals and others ) as provided by the recent large - scale observations of galaxies , particularly the two degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows : we begin section 2 by listing the basic equations of gravitational lensing statistics and the assumptions we make to derive them .",
    "we also briefly describe the adopted source sample and luminosity function for the galaxies . in section 3 , we develop the image separation distribution function as a tool to put constraints on the cosmological parameters .",
    "section 4 describes use of @xmath22 vs @xmath23 as a tool to constrain the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in section 5",
    "we discuss our findings .",
    "0.5 cm      we consider a spatially flat , homogeneous and isotropic model of cosmology with non - relativistic matter with energy density @xmath24 and a separately conserved `` dark energy component '' with an equation of state @xmath25 .",
    "the condition for a flat universe becomes @xmath26 where                ( l , z = 0)dl = _ ( l l_)^(- ll _ ) dll _ , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the characteristic number density , faint end slope and characteristic luminosity respectively at the present epoch .",
    "we further assume that the total comoving number density of galaxies is conserved .",
    "thus the comoving number density of galaxies at redshift @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the present number density of galaxies .",
    "the two large - scale galaxy surveys : 2dfgrs and sdss , have produced converging results on the total lf .",
    "the surveys determined the schechter parameters for galaxies ( all types ) at @xmath41 .",
    "chae ( 2002 ) @xcite has worked extensively on the information provided by the recent galaxy surveys to extract the local type - specific lfs .",
    "as the information on the total lf is abundant and the results are convergent , the total lf can be decomposed into an early - type lf and a late - type lf .",
    "the inference of the type - specific lfs from the total lf relies on an independent knowledge of relative type - specific lfs .",
    "we use the normalization corrected 2dfgrs lens and schechter parameters as evaluated by chae @xcite . the 2dfgrs survey ( folkes et al .",
    "( 1999 ) @xcite ) employs the `` principal component analysis '' of galaxy spectra , which essentially maximally quantify differences between the spectra of galaxies , to study lfs per type .",
    "table 1 lists the lens and the schechter parameters used in this work .",
    "we have adopted the parameters per morphological type as given by chae ( 2002)@xcite .    for the ellipticals and lenticulars , characteristic velocity dispersion @xmath42 and the characteristic luminosity @xmath37 follow the faber - jackson relation ( @xmath43 ) . for spirals , @xmath42 and @xmath37",
    "are related by the tully - fisher relation ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "we express this as = ( ) ^[fj ]          we are thankful to kyu -hyun chae , phillip helbig and amber habib for useful discussions .",
