    "much like their long - duration cousins , the discovery of the first x - ray @xcite , optical @xcite , and radio @xcite afterglows of short - duration ( @xmath4s ) gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has driven great progress in recent years .",
    "based primarily on the discovery of the first four afterglows , grb050509b ( @xmath5 ; @xcite ) , grb050709 ( @xmath6 ; @xcite ) , grb050724 ( @xmath7 ; @xcite ) , and grb051221 ( @xmath8 ; @xcite ) , a general picture of short - duration grb hosts quickly emerged . unlike long - duration events , short - duration grbs occur in both early- and late - type galaxies , all at relatively low redshift ( compared to @xmath9 for long - duration _ swift _  grbs ; @xcite ) . if , as is widely believed , short - duration grbs result from coalescence of a compact binary ( neutron star  neutron star [ ns - ns ] or neutron star ",
    "black hole [ ns - bh ] ; @xcite ) , these nearby events imply a long progenitor delay time ( @xmath10gyr ; @xcite ) , inconsistent with the properties of such systems observed in the milky way .    in a recent work , @xcite",
    "have searched the afterglow error circles of nine additional short - duration bursts without an established redshift , identifying a population of faint ( @xmath11  26mag ) putative host galaxies .",
    "spectroscopy of the brightest four of these galaxies indicate they lie at @xmath12 , while a comparison with field galaxies indicates the fainter hosts likely reside at @xmath13 .",
    "the implications of the existence of a high - redshift ( @xmath3 ) population of short - duration bursts would be profound , in terms of the implied isotropic energy release ( @xmath14  @xmath15erg ) , the progenitor delay times ( both shorter and a broader distribution ) , and the possibility of detection with ground - based gravitational wave detectors .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we present spectra of the host galaxies of two recent grbs : the short - duration grb070429b and the likely short - duration with extended emission grb070714b .",
    "both events have detected optical afterglows , providing both a secure host association and a secure redshift , thereby overcoming the primary limitation of our previous statistical study .",
    "both hosts lie at @xmath1 , providing strong evidence in favor of a substantial population of high - redshift short - duration bursts .",
    "we conclude by discussing the impact of this population on short - duration burst progenitor models .",
    "the burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) on board _ swift _   detected and localized grb070429b at 03:09:04 ut @xcite .",
    "the duration of the prompt emission was measured to be @xmath16s , placing the event firmly in the short - duration category @xcite . fitting a power - law with index @xmath17 , @xcite measure a prompt fluence of @xmath18erg @xmath19 in the 15  150kev band .",
    "the fading x - ray afterglow was identified by the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) on board _ swift _  in ground analysis at location @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( j2000.0 ) with a 90%-confidence uncertainty of @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we imaged the position of the x - ray afterglow with the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ; @xcite ) mounted on the 8-m gemini south telescope beginning at utc 07:59:55 29 april ( @xmath23h after the trigger ) .",
    "we identified a single faint , extended object inside the xrt error circle at coordinates @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( j2000.0 ) , with an uncertainty of @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:0429_finder ] ; @xcite ) . an additional ,",
    "fainter source inside the xrt error circle was identified by @xcite at coordinates @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "the field was observed by several other facilities in the following months , yet no variability was detected in either source ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent re - analysis of the initial observations from the _ swift _  uv - optical telescope ( uvot ; @xcite ) beginning 230s after the burst trigger revealed a marginal source in the @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 filters at @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( j2000.0 ) which subsequently faded away @xcite . while none of the individual uvot detections was particularly significant , summing all seven uvot filters from 591 to 2661s after the trigger results in a 3.9-@xmath34 detection @xcite .",
    "we therefore accept that this source is the optical afterglow of grb070429b .",
    "the uvot afterglow falls only @xmath35 from the centroid of the candidate host first proposed by @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig:0429_finder ] ) . because the angular extent of the galaxy in our gemini image is about 1 , the uvot afterglow position is directly coincident with this galaxy . using the cumulative galaxy counts in the hudf and goods surveys",
    "@xcite , we estimate the probability of an @xmath36mag galaxy falling within @xmath35 of the afterglow location to be @xmath37 . on the other hand ,",
    "the chance alignment of the other object identified in the xrt error circle by @xcite is as high as 0.3 .",
    "it is therefore likely that this source is the host galaxy of grb070429b .",
    "we obtained a spectrum of this object with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; @xcite ) mounted on the 10-m keck i telescope on the night of 12 august 2007 .",
    "two 1800 s exposures were taken at high air mass ( @xmath38 ) with the 07 slit .",
    "we employed a dichroic at 5600  to split the beam in two .",
    "the 400/8500 grating on the red side provides coverage from 5600  8500  , with a dispersion of 1.86  pixel@xmath39 .",
    "the 400/3400 grism was responsible for the dispersion on the blue end , resulting in coverage from the atmospheric cut - off up to @xmath40 5600  and a dispersion of 1.09   pixel@xmath39 .",
    "spectra were reduced in the iraf environment using standard routines .",
    "dithered spectra were subtracted to remove residual sky lines .",
    "cosmic rays were removed using the la cosmic routine @xcite .",
    "the resulting spectrum was extracted optimally @xcite and wavelength calibration was performed first relative to calibration lamps and then tweaked based on night sky lines .",
    "both air - to - vacuum and heliocentric corrections were then applied to all spectra .",
    "extracted spectra were divided through by a smoothed flux standard to remove narrow band ( @xmath41 ) instrumental effects @xcite .",
    "flux calibration was performed relative to the spectrophotometric standard feige 11 @xcite . to account for slit losses",
    ", we scaled the resulting spectrum to match the measured photometric @xmath42- and @xmath43-band magnitudes @xcite .",
    "finally , we de - reddened the spectrum to account for the modest galactic extinction : @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the resulting spectrum of the host galaxy of grb070429b is shown in figure  [ fig:0429_spec ] .",
    "we find a single faint emission line at @xmath45 .",
    "due to the lack of blueward features , we identify this line as [ ] @xmath0 3727 at a redshift of @xmath46 .",
    "fitting the line with a gaussian profile , we measure a flux of @xmath47erg @xmath19 s@xmath39 . adopting the most recent @xmath48cdm parameters for a flat universe from wmap ( @xmath49 km s@xmath39 mpc@xmath39 ; @xmath50 , @xmath51 ; @xcite ) , and using the transformation from @xcite",

    "we caution , however , these values are only lower limits , as they do not incorporate any extinction native to the host .",

    "swift_-bat at 04:59:29 ut on 17 july 2007 @xcite . using the best - fit power - law spectrum with index @xmath56 , the 15  150kev fluence in the prompt emission was measured to be @xmath57erg @xmath19 . while the duration of the prompt emission is significantly longer than the canonical long - short divide ( @xmath58s ) , the burst light curve is comprised of several short spikes ( duration @xmath59s ) with a long , soft tail @xcite .",
    "the spectral lag is consistent with zero @xcite , a property typically observed in short - duration bursts @xcite . like grbs 050709 and 050724 ,",
    "grb070714b therefore appears likely to be a member of the short - duration bursts with extended emission ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , together with the uncertainty regarding the duration , we caution that a small number of long - duration ( i.e.  massive star progenitor ) _ swift _  events have been observed with zero lag @xcite .",
    "a fading optical afterglow was discovered inside the xrt error circle @xcite by several groups @xcite .",
    "the latest flux measurements and most precise astrometric position were reported by @xcite , who find an @xmath43-band magnitude of 25.5mag and location @xmath60 , @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ; j2000.0 ) .",
    "the probability of a chance association for such a precise localization ( @xmath63 ) is quite small , @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "we obtained two 2100s dithered spectra of the host galaxy of grb070714b with lris on the night of 13 august 2007 .",
    "these spectra were reduced in an identical manner as those obtained for grb070429b (  [ sec:070429 ] ) .",
    "flux calibration was performed relative to the spectrophotometric standard star bd+17@xmath654708 @xcite .",
    "the resulting spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig:0714_spec ] .",
    "we find a single bright emission line at @xmath66 , which we again identify as [ ] @xmath0 3727 at @xmath67 .",
    "this confirms the spectroscopic redshift first proposed by @xcite in the gcn circulars .",
    "we measure a flux of @xmath68erg @xmath19 s@xmath39 for this line , corresponding to a lower limit on the star formation rate of @xmath69m@xmath53 yr@xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding specific star formation rate for grb070714b is @xmath70m@xmath53 yr@xmath39 l@xmath55 .",
    "in summary , we present the redshifts of the host galaxies of the short - duration grb070429b ( @xmath71 ) and the short - duration with extended emission grb070714b ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "these are the two highest redshifts for short - duration grbs with detected optical afterglows , making the grb - host associations robust .",
    "our results lend credence to the primary conclusions of our previous study of short - duration grb hosts and their redshifts , which was based in part on xrt positions ( @xmath73 ) , and in some cases on probabilistic redshifts from host magnitudes .",
    "we now attempt to estimate the contribution of high - redshift galaxies to the observed short - duration population .",
    "we first consider only those short - duration events with optical afterglows ( and hence secure host identifications ) and secure host redshifts ( from spectroscopy ) : grbs 050709 ( @xmath74 ) , 050724 ( @xmath75 ) , 051221a ( @xmath76 ) , 061006 ( @xmath77 ; @xcite ) , and the two hosts presented here .",
    "high redshift ( @xmath3 ) hosts constitute 33% of this sample .",
    "however , because these events are biased towards the brightest ( and therefore , probabilistically , most nearby ) hosts ( see @xcite , fig .  8) , we also consider three additional events with secure hosts but no host redshifts ( due primarily to faintness ) : grbs 060313 @xcite , 060121 @xcite , and 051227 @xcite . if , as is likely from their faintness , all three events lie at @xmath3 , the percentage of high redshift short - duration grbs may be as high as 56% .",
    "we note that this result does not change dramatically if we include xrt - host associations ( e.g.  grbs 050509b and 060502b ) .",
    "the range of one- to two - thirds is in line with our previous analysis .",
    "however , we caution that the errors on these estimates are quite large due to small number statistics , and we do not consider here any selections effects associated with the above samples .    at @xmath1 ,",
    "the isotropic prompt energy release from grb070429b is @xmath78erg , while the corresponding value for grb070714b is @xmath79erg .",
    "these values are several orders of magnitude larger than most of the previously established short - duration grbs at @xmath80 , though still well short of typical values for long - duration events ( @xmath81erg ; @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity at @xmath82d , @xmath83 , extrapolated from the online _ swift _  x - ray light curve repository @xcite , is consistent with the correlation found between @xmath83 and @xmath84 found for the majority of short - duration events @xcite .",
    "like long - duration events , collimation corrections may play an important role in the total energy budget for short - duration bursts ( e.g.  grb051221a ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , if a full 56% of short - duration events reside at @xmath3 , the energy release of short - duration events may approach the canonical long - duration value of @xmath85erg @xcite .",
    "energies in excess of @xmath15erg are difficult to explain in the context of @xmath86 annihilation models @xcite , and may instead favor energy extraction via magneto - hydrodynamic processes ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "much as with energetics , the specific star formation rate of grb070429b falls intermediate between the nearby short - duration events ( @xmath87m@xmath53 yr@xmath39 l@xmath55 ; @xcite and references therein ) and long - duration grbs ( @xmath88m@xmath53 yr@xmath39 l@xmath55 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the specific star formation rate of grb070714b , however , is more consistent with the long - duration population , although large errors preclude any firm conclusions from being drawn .",
    "the detection of short - duration grbs in late - type galaxies at @xmath89 is more consistent with our current understanding of compact binary coalescence models ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "progenitor models with long delay times ( @xmath90gyr ) and narrow , log - normal distributions ( @xmath91 ) were consistent with previous analyses based solely on the most nearby events .",
    "our results here favor models with a shorter characteristic delay time ( @xmath92gyr ) , but much broader distribution ( @xmath93 ; @xcite ) .",
    "further studies with a significantly expanded sample will be required for a detailed comparison of the properties of short - duration hosts with those predicted by compact binary merger models ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    based in part on observations obtained at the gemini observatory ( program i d : gs-2007a - q-6 ) , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc . , under a cooperative agreement with the nsf on behalf of the gemini partnership : the national science foundation ( united states ) , the science and technology facilities council ( united kingdom ) , the national research council ( canada ) , conicyt ( chile ) , the australian research council ( australia ) , cnpq ( brazil ) and secyt ( argentina )",
