    "the abundance of galaxy clusters as a function of mass @xmath3 at high redshift @xmath4 is particularly sensitive to different cosmological models . to probe cosmology and dark energy we must observe galaxy clusters at high redshift and",
    "obtain mass estimates for them .",
    "observations of the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite are a powerful way to probe galaxy clusters by detecting the hot cluster gas @xcite .",
    "sz - detected clusters are in principle particularly powerful as they can be seen to high redshifts .",
    "the intensity of the sz effect summed over the entire cluster closely tracks the mass of the cluster @xcite .",
    "x - ray or sz effect mass estimates are based on simplified assumptions such as a hydrostatic equilibrium for the cluster gas .",
    "it is becoming increasingly apparent , however , that we can not fully model the complex gas physics in clusters within a simple framework .",
    "nonetheless , it will be very challenging to calibrate cluster masses at high redshift , so in order to use sz observations to probe cluster properties and cosmological models it is important to understand the relationship between mass and sz observables in lower redshift systems .",
    "gravitational lensing facilitates the calibration of the sz observables to obtain accurate masses for sz detections @xcite .",
    "a large area in the southern sky is currently being surveyed in sz by the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) and the south pole telescope ( spt ) .",
    "gravitational lensing is dependent only on the projected mass distribution of the lens and so it is possible to study the mass distribution independent of its form , including the distribution of dark matter .",
    "gravitational lensing causes small ( @xmath5 a few @xmath6 ) changes to the shape of individual galaxies , which can be used to reconstruct the mass distribution in the region @xcite ; for a review see @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present measurements of weak lensing masses for clusters which were , for the first time , detected blind by their sz decrement @xcite .",
    "we also include mass measurements from 24 optically - detected clusters .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in  [ sec : observations ] we present the data and discuss the image processing ;  [ sec : wl ] describes the gravitational lensing methods used ; the mass measurements are presented in  [ sec : results ] and we compare with measurements from other techniques and calculate the @xmath2 parameters . throughout this paper we assume a flat cosmology with @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 km  s@xmath10mpc@xmath10 with @xmath11 .",

    "two areas of southern sky have been targeted , centred on @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "these fields lie within a larger area of the southern sky which act and spt plan to survey .",
    "the paper is based on observations taken in 2005 , with the exception of 2 clusters from 2006 data .",
    "the seeing varies between @xmath17 and @xmath18 with a mean of @xmath19 .",
    "the image reduction was carried out using the rutgers southern cosmology pipeline ( flat field correction , ccd calibration , removal of saturated star bleed - trails , and bad pixel masks ) .",
    "next the images were aligned , stacked and median combined using swarp @xcite ; an astrometric solution was found by matching stars to sources in the us naval observatory catalog .",
    "additional masks were made to remove saturated stars , satellite trails and other blemishes in the image , removing 8% in total . for more information see @xcite .",
    "note that we use ab magnitudes throughout .",
    "to calculate photometric redshifts ( photo-@xmath4s ) , multi - band sextractor @xcite _ g , r , i , z _ isophotal magnitudes were used to find redshift probability distributions of each object .",
    "this was done using the bpz code @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "we focused on 4 clusters found in sz @xcite and also 38 optical clusters selected from @xmath0 square degrees @xcite .",
    "of the 38 clusters , we found non - zero mass estimates for 24 clusters , and upper limits for the remaining clusters .",
    "we do not consider 5 of the clusters as they are in regions only observed in a single exposure .",
    "we used the _ i_-band data , 3 co - added exposures of 450s each , for our shear analysis , and measured galaxy shapes using the @xcite ( ksb ) method .",
    "our pipeline is based on @xcite and labelled `` mb '' in @xcite , but has been automated to process rapidly the large scs data set .",
    "the method deviates from `` mb '' in automated star / galaxy separation and in point spread function ( psf ) interpolation .",
    "we tested the pipeline against simulated images from the shear testing programme ( step ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our method underestimates shear , but consistently throughout a wide range of observing conditions , which is henceforth compensated for in our shear measurements by applying a calibration factor of @xmath20 , similar to  mb \" .    as in  mb",

    "the median redshift is @xmath27 @xcite ; 69% of galaxies in our catalogue also had photo-@xmath4s , which have a consistent @xmath4 distribution @xcite .",
    "departing from the `` mb '' pipeline , we performed star / galaxy separation via the automated theli algorithm @xcite , and automated the removal of galaxies with abnormally large values of shear polarizability , smear polarizability or ellipticity , which was present in the",
    " mb \" method but labor intensive and slow .",
    "the observed shapes of galaxies were finally corrected for the blurring effect of the psf .",
    "we measured the psf using the @xmath28 unsaturated stars per square arcminute with @xmath29 ( s / n @xmath30 to @xmath31 ) .",
    "the psf ellipticity is @xmath32 , where the error is the standard deviation throughout the survey .",
    "optical effects and temporal variation of the atmosphere and telescope between dithered exposures produce patterns in psf size and ellipticity .",
    "this variation was fitted as a sum of polynomials ( of order @xmath33 in the @xmath34 and @xmath35 directions ) plus sums of sines and cosines ( of orders up to @xmath33 in @xmath34 and @xmath36 in @xmath35 ) .",

    "the peaks of the surface mass density in the wiener - filtered maps were , where present , assumed to be at the centre of the cluster , otherwise ( spt  0547 - 5345 ) the luminosity - weighted centre was used .",
    "the latter procedure was followed for the optically selected clusters .",
    "our wiener - filtered reconstruction was done as follows : the two - point correlation function of the lensing convergence , used as prior for the wiener reconstruction , was estimated from the shear - shear correlation @xcite @xmath39 in the data itself . in order to have a smooth prior , we fitted the measured @xmath40 with @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are constants determined by the fit . to obtain s / n maps of the lensing maps we divided the maps by the r.m.s . of 500 noise realisations , which were generated by randomly rotating the ellipticities of the sources followed by a wiener reconstruction .",
