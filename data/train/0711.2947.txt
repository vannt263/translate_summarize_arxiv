    "error bars of the data points account for the uncertainty of the excitation energy from the photon scattering rate , taking into account uncertainties in the laser beam waist @xmath149 , laser saturation uncertainty of 15% , and laser detuning uncertainty of @xmath150 .",
    "the overall uncertainty results in 15% errors for the excitation energy .",
    "the theoretical prediction of the simple model ( dashed line ) for solely the error function transport does not agree with the data .",
    "however , we found a motional excitation of @xmath151 due to the morphing steps of the potential before and after the transport by replacing steps ( iii ) and ( iv ) in the measurement cycle by a waiting time of equal length .",
    "the solid line shows this modified prediction together with its standard deviation ( dashed ) . ]",
    "employing a novel segmented linear paul trap we demonstrated stable trapping of single ions and cold ion crystals .",
    "for the first time we have shown fast , non - adiabatic transports over @xmath3 travels within a few microseconds by error function ramps .",
    "main achievement is the characterization of the ion s motional excitation .",
    "the method is based on the measured modification of the ion s scattering rate during doppler cooling . in the future , however , sideband cooling and spectroscopic sideband analysis will be applied yielding a much more sensitive tool to investigate motional energy transfers .",
    "this will lead to a largely improved determination of ion excess motion",
    ". then subtle changes of the parameters and the application of optimal control theory for the voltage ramps may be applied to yield lower motional excitation .",
    "furthermore , we will establish a dedicated loading zone and optimize the transport of single ions and linear crystals through the tapered zone .    for micro - structured segmented ion traps with axial trap frequencies of several mhz , the application of the demonstrated techniques will lead to transport times of a few microseconds only .",
    "this way , future quantum algorithms may no longer be limited by the ion transport but only by the time required for logic gate operations .",
