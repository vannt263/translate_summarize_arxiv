    "a number of investigations have shown that high precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies can be used to determine many cosmological parameters to unprecedented precision ( jungman 1996 ; bond , efstathiou and tegmark 1997 , hereafter bet97 ; zaldarriaga , spergel and seljak 1997 , hereafter zss97 ) .",
    "these parameters include the amplitudes and spectral indices of the scalar and tensor fluctuations predicted by inflationary models ( knox and turner 1994 , knox 1995 , lidsey 1997 , souradeep 1998 , copeland 1998 ) , the densities of the various components of the mass density of the universe , and constraints on the geometry of the universe .",
    "the prospect of measuring such cosmological parameters to high precision has formed an important part of the scientific case for two approved satellite missions , nasa s map satellite ( bennett 1996 ) and esa s planck surveyor(bersanelli 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , ground based and balloon experiments are already beginning to set useful constraints on some of these parameters ( _ e.g. _ bond and jaffe 1997 , hancock 1997 , lineweaver and barbosa 1998a , b , webster 1998 ) .    in this paper , we investigate degeneracies among cosmological parameters , _",
    "i.e. _ to what extent can we disentangle one parameter from another using measurements of the cmb anisotropies alone ( see also bond 1994 ) .",
    "we assume throughout that the primordial fluctuations are adiabatic and gaussian , as expected in most inflationary models ( _ e.g. _ linde 1990 ) .",
    "these assumptions are physically well motivated and allow accurate calculations of the cmb anisotropies as a function of cosmological parameters via fast numerical solutions of the relativistic boltzmann equation .",
    "the accuracy of computations of cmb anisotropies in topological defect models has greatly improved recently ( see turok , pen and seljak , 1997 , albrecht , battye and robinson 1997 ) and tend to disfavour the simplest versions of defect models .",
    "however , these calculations can not yet be done to sufficient precision for the type of analysis presented in this paper . nevertheless , some qualitative features of the discussion presented here are likely to be applicable to defect models and to other classes of models such as isocurvature theories .",
    "we distinguish between a nearly exact degeneracy ( which we call the ` geometrical ' degeneracy ) and other parameter degeneracies .",
    "the geometrical degeneracy ( bet97 , zss97 ) leads to near identical cmb anisotropies in universes with different background geometries but identical matter content . in linear perturbation theory",
    ", observations of the primary cmb anisotropies can not break the geometrical degeneracy , no matter how precise the experimental measurements .",
    "the geometrical degeneracy thus imposes fundamental limits on measurements of the curvature of the universe and the hubble constant derived from cmb anisotropy measurements . of the remaining parameter degeneracies ,",
    "some are extremely sensitive to the accuracy of the cmb anisotropy measurements whilst others are not . in this paper",
    ", we give a physical description of the causes of some of the parameter degeneracies and of the fundamental limits imposed by cmb anisotropy measurements .",
    "this paper is laid out as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we summarise the formalism based on the fisher matrix ( jungman 1996 , tegmark , taylor and heavens 1997 ) which is assumed in most discussions of parameter estimation from the cmb . throughout this paper , we use approximate experimental parameters for the map and planck satellites to provide numerical examples of what might be achieved in the next decade or so . the experimental parameters that we use",
    "are summarised in section [ sec:2 ] . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    ", we discuss the geometrical degeneracy and we show that with an appropriate change of variables , the fisher matrix can be applied to give accurate results for cosmological models of arbitrary curvature . in section [ sec:4 ] ,",
    "we specialise to spatially flat cosmological models and analyse degeneracies among other cosmological parameters .",
    "we show that a principal component analysis provides a powerful technique for analysing degeneracies among parameters . for experiments such as map and planck , that sample the cmb anisotropy power spectrum beyond the first doppler peak , the first few principal components",
    "dominate the expected variances of most cosmological parameters .",
    "we test the accuracy of the fisher matrix approach by performing an exact likelihood analysis in a subspace defined by the two most poorly determined principal components .",
    "some of the degeneracies among cosmological parameters can be understood in terms of the locations of the doppler peaks and of the height of the first doppler peak . in section [ sec:4 ]",
    ", we compare the accuracies of parameter estimates from the improved version of map with those from planck .",
    "we distinguish between ` strength ' and ` statistical significance ' in the analysis of cmb power spectra and discuss the effects of possible systematic errors that might arise , for example , through inaccurate subtraction of point sources , galactic foregrounds and map reconstruction errors .",
    "section [ sec:5 ] discusses briefly how some of the degeneracies among cosmological parameters can be removed by using other types of observation , _",
    "e.g. _ measurements of the hubble constant , the age of the universe and constraints on the luminosity distance from observations of distant type 1a supernovae .",
    "our conclusions are summarised in section [ sec:6 ] . throughout this paper",
    "we use cmb power spectra computed with the cmbfast code developed by seljak and zaldarriaga ( 1996 ) .",
    "we assume that the initial fluctuations are adiabatic and gaussian .",
    "the temperature anisotropies @xmath0 of the cmb on the celestial sphere can be decomposed in a spherical harmonic expansion , @xmath1 where each coefficient @xmath2 is statistically independent and gaussian distributed with zero mean and variance @xmath3 the power spectrum , @xmath4 , completely specifies the statistical properties of the primary cmb temperature fluctuations if the initial fluctuations are gaussian .",
    "the anisotropy of thomson scattering results in a small net linear polarization of the cmb anisotropies ( kaiser 1983 , bond and efstathiou 1984 ) . for near scale - invariant spectra ,",
    "this linear polarization amounts to a few percent of the total temperature anisotropy and should be measurable in future cmb experiments such as map and planck .",
    "polarization introduces three additional power - spectra to fully characterise the temperature anisotropies .",
    "these define the ` electric ' and ` magnetic ' components of the polarization pattern and the cross correlation of the polarization pattern with the temperature anisotropies ( see e.g. seljak and zaldarriaga 1996 , hu and white 1997 ) .",
    "we do not analyse polarization in any detail in this paper .",
    "the effects of polarization measurements on cosmological parameters has been discussed recently by zss97 .",
    "their results show that polarization measurements can improve the accuracy of most cosmological parameters by relatively modest factors , with two important exceptions , distinguishing between scalar and tensor modes and determining the redshift at which the intergalactic medium was reionized .",
    "the role of polarization will be discussed further in section [ sec:4 ] .",
    "we follow the notation of bet97 and assume that a cosmological model is specified by a set of parameters @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 be the prior probability distribution of the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath7 the likelihood function defined by the experiment .",
    "the probability distribution of the parameters @xmath5 , taking into account the new experimental information , is given by bayes theorem @xmath8 .",

    "if we assume a uniform prior , as we will do throughout this paper , then the covariance matrix @xmath26 is the inverse of the fisher matrix @xmath27 .",
    "the standard deviation of a parameter @xmath28 , marginalized over uncertainties in the other parameters , is given by @xmath29 .",
    "table [ tab1 ] lists the resolutions , @xmath30 , sensitivities @xmath31 and the noise power parameters @xmath32 for the various frequency channels that we have adopted .",
    "the parameter set labelled omap ( ` original map ' ) is for the original specifications of the map satellite , as given in the proposal of bennet _",
    "et al_. parameters for the current map design are listed under the heading cmap ( ` current map ' ) .",
    "these include a significant improvement in the angular resolution at all frequencies compared to the original design specifications .",
    "we have listed the parameters for the @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ghz channels ; the angular resolutions of the lower frequency map channels are so much poorer ( @xmath36 at @xmath37ghz and @xmath38 at @xmath39ghz ) that they carry very little weight in the estimation of cosmological parameters and so are ignored here .",
    "the main purpose of these lower frequency channels is to monitor the free - free and synchrotron contributions from the galaxy .",

    "the constraints lead to large changes in the errors of some parameters , _",
    "e.g. _ the fractional error in @xmath40 decreases by about a factor of @xmath41 , the fractional error in @xmath42 decreases by a factor of @xmath43 and the error in @xmath44 decreases by a factor of between @xmath45 and @xmath41 . for a planck - type experiment , however , imposing the constraints leads to hardly any change in the parameter errors . as table [ tab3 ] and figure [ figure6 ]",
    "show , for a planck - type experiment , there is almost a decoupling between the highly uncertain tensor parameters and the high order principal components .",
    "the results of table [ tab6 ] show that the errors on cosmological parameters can be reduced by making certain specific assumptions concerning the inflationary model . for",
    "omap and cmap - type experiments , the reduction in the errors is very significant , but at the expense of overly restricting the inflation model . allowing full freedom in how @xmath46 and thus @xmath47 is structured can result in strong variations in @xmath48 , with the consequence that the power ratio [ eq:27b ] to [ eq:27a ] and the indices @xmath49 and @xmath50 could be complex functions of the wavenumber . as might be expected ,",
    "if there is complete functional freedom , the errors on the cosmological parameters become much larger ( e.g. , souradeep 1998 ) . such inflation models with many features over the small regime of @xmath51 that the cmb can probe seem rather baroque , and constraining the potential by invoking smoothness `` prior probabilities '' seems perfectly reasonable . for example , a simple way that this has been included in the past is to allow the spectral indices to `` run '' with a logarithmic correction : @xmath52 ( kosowsky and turner 1995 , lidsey 1997 ) . of course ,",
    "in presenting the results of cmb parameter estimation , the constraints ( if any ) applied to the tensor mode must be spelled out precisely .",
    "this analysis illustrates also that constraints on the tensor component derived from cmb polarization measurements , could lead to a significant improvement in the estimates of other parameters , including the baryon and cdm densities .",
    "the next generation of cmb satellites should lead to estimates of @xmath4 with errors dominated by cosmic variance , @xmath53 for multipoles @xmath54  @xmath55 . at @xmath54 ,",
    "cosmic variance limits the @xmath56 accuracy of a measurement of @xmath4 to about @xmath41 percent . at first sight",
    ", it might seem as though there is little point in measuring @xmath4 ( and subtracting contaminating foregrounds ) to a much higher accuracy than the limit imposed by cosmic variance",
    ". however , such thinking would be incorrect .",
    "the reason is related to the concepts of strength and significance in statistics ( see press 1996 ) and we illustrate the point with the following simple example .",
    "imagine that we have @xmath16 independent random variates , each drawn from a gaussian with a mean and dispersion of unity . from these @xmath16",
    "random variates we can estimate the mean @xmath57 with variance @xmath58 thus , even though the variance on each individual point is unity , we can determine the mean to arbitrarily high precision if we have a large enough number of points , ( @xmath59 , in the limit @xmath60 ) .",
    "we can therefore differentiate between two samples with slightly different means ( @xmath61 ) , provided we have enough points in each sample . in this example , each point has very little _ strength _ ( since the difference in the means is much smaller that the variance ) but in the limit of large samples we can detect a small difference in the means to high _",
    "significance_.    the estimation of cosmological parameters from measurements of the power spectrum is analogous to the above example .",
    "the cmb satellites will provide , via @xmath4 , measurements of @xmath62@xmath63 nearly statistically independent numbers from which we wish to determine a much smaller number ( perhaps @xmath64@xmath65 ) cosmological parameters . since we have a large number of independent points ,",
    "it is possible to measure parameter differences to high significance even though the strength of each individual point is small .",
    "furthermore , since the number of cosmological parameters that we wish to measure is much smaller than the number of independent multipoles , we must measure each @xmath4 to an accuracy that is much smaller than the cosmic variance ; correlated systematic errors between the measured @xmath4 coefficients which introduces a difference in @xmath66 of the order the number of _ parameters _ can lead to a significant bias in the cosmological parameter estimates , the exact bias depending on the nature of the correlations",
    ". we will expand on these points in the rest of this section .",
    "8.9 truein    -0.2 truein    -0.1 truein    -0.1 truein    -0.1 truein    figure [ figure11 ] is designed to illustrated the concepts of strength and significance as applied to measurements of @xmath4 .",
    "the dotted curves in the upper panels of the figure show @xmath4 for a spatially flat cdm model with the parameters listed in the figure heading .",
    "the solid lines show the power spectrum of the spatially flat target model defined in the previous section .",
    "the parameters for the three examples in this figure were chosen so that the @xmath4 curves would be distinguishable by omap at about the @xmath67 level ; in other words , we have chosen three pairs of spatially flat cdm models that would be difficult to distinguish with omap alone even if there were no significant systematic errors in the measurements .",
    "the three examples have been chosen so that : in figure [ figure11](a ) the baryon and cdm densities each differ by about @xmath68 from those of the target model , while the inflationary parameters @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are almost the same as those of the target model ; in figure [ figure11](b ) , the baryon density differs by @xmath72 from that of the target model while @xmath73 differs by @xmath74 ; in figure [ figure11](c ) the cdm density differs by @xmath75 from that of the target model while @xmath76 differs by @xmath77 . in the models of figures [ figure11](b ) and [ figure11](c ) ,",
    "the large changes in the densities have been balanced by relatively large changes in the inflationary parameters .",
    "to better than @xmath78 ( see _ e.g. _ liddle 1997 and references therein ) ] the points in each figure show a simulated @xmath4 spectrum for each experiment , assuming the dotted curve for @xmath4 , and with errors computed from equation ( [ eq:5a ] ) .",
    "the lower panels show the residuals relative to the target model .",
    "the number labelled @xmath66 in each panel gives the likelihood ratio @xmath79 , computed from equation  ( [ eq:9 ] ) .",
    "( in computing @xmath66 we used @xmath80 for omap , @xmath81 for cmap and @xmath82 for planck .",
    "however , the value of @xmath66 is insensitive to @xmath83 since the errors in @xmath4 increase exponentially at high multipoles . )",
    "the spatially flat models that we have considered are defined by @xmath84 parameters , thus a @xmath85 rejection of a model requires a @xmath66 of @xmath86 .",
    "this is similar , by construction , to the values of @xmath66 listed for omap .",
    "for cmap , and particularly , planck , the values of @xmath66 are much larger , demonstrating their superior ability to distinguish between cosmological models .",
    "an experiment such as planck can distinguish between two @xmath4 curves at a high significance level even if the differences between them are much smaller than the cosmic variance ; in fact the power spectra and residuals for a pair of models with @xmath87 would be indistinguishable plotted on the scales of figure [ figure11 ] .",
    "small , correlated errors in @xmath4 can thus introduce biases in estimates of cosmological parameters .",
    "the degree of bias depends on the size of the errors and the extent to which the correlated component resembles the shape of the derivatives of @xmath4 with respect to cosmological parameters .",
    "the analysis of correlated errors in @xmath4 can therefore be viewed as another aspect of the analysis of degeneracies in cosmological parameter estimation .",
    "there are many possible sources of correlated errors in @xmath4 .",
    "the most obvious are errors caused by inaccurate subtraction of emission from the galaxy and extragalactic point sources",
    ". however , there are many other more instrument specific sources of error , for example , in a ` total - power ' experiment like planck , the scanning strategy together with instrumental ` @xmath88 ' noise can introduce systematic errors in maps of the cmb ( sometime called ` striping ' , wright 1996 , bersanelli 1996 , tegmark 1997a , delabrouille 1998 ) .",
    "the resulting effect of scanning on @xmath4 depends on the details of the experiment and map - making methods , but for a fairly wide class of possibilities leads to a contribution to @xmath4 that varies as @xmath89 ( tegmark 1997a ) .",
    "the scanning errors in the cmb maps should be much smaller in a differential experiment , such as map .",
    "fortunately , foreground and scanning errors are unlikely to produce wiggles in @xmath4 that can distort or mimic the doppler peak structure at high multipoles .",
    "instead , we would expect smoothly varying errors to correlate with the low - order principal components .    to illustrate the effects of correlated errors we have constructed the following simple models @xmath90 and @xmath91 the first model ( which we denote ` f ' ) is designed to mimic the power spectrum of contaminating foregrounds .",
    "the first term is a rough approximation to the power spectrum of the major sources of galactic emission , free - free , synchrotron and dust emission ( low and cutri 1994 ; guarini , melchiorri and melchiorri 1995 , tegmark and efstathiou 1996 , bouchet 1997 ) .",
    "the second term represents the white noise from unresolved extragalactic point sources .",
    "the analysis of bouchet ( 1997 ) suggests the following values for @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( in @xmath94 ) at @xmath35ghz and @xmath95ghz : @xmath96 the values of @xmath92 in ( [ eq:34a],[eq:34b ] ) are for the cleanest regions of the sky .",
    "the second model ( which we denote ` s ' ) is based on the analysis of tegmark ( 1997a ) and is designed to approximate correlated scanning errors .",
    "values for the constants @xmath97 and @xmath98 are extremely sensitive to the experimental details but plausible values for a ` total - power ' experiment may be @xmath99 with @xmath97 in the range @xmath100  @xmath101 ( see tegmark 1997a , figure  [ figure10 ] ) .",
    "the models of equations ( [ eq:32 ] ) and ( [ eq:33 ] ) are illustrated in figure [ figure12 ] .",
    "3.0 truein    figures [ figure13 ] and [ figure14 ] shows the biases in a number of cosmological parameters for various choices of the parameters @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath97 . to compute these figures ,",
    "we have generated monte - carlo realizations of the cmb power spectrum , to which we have added the systematic error models of equations ( [ eq:32 ] ) and ( [ eq:33 ] ) .",
    "we then compute values of the cosmological parameters by fitting the first order expansion to @xmath4 ( equation [ eq:13 ] ) as in the computations of figures [ figure7]a and [ figure7]b . the bias in each parameter has been divided by the expected standard deviation in each parameter to illustrate when systematic errors become larger than the random errors .",
    "the results are encouraging .",
    "for omap and cmap , the tensor parameters are significantly affected for values of @xmath92 @xmath102 and the remaining parameters for values @xmath103 .",
    "omap and cmap are unaffected by point source contributions with @xmath104 because they are insensitive to the power spectrum at high multipoles where point sources dominate .",
    "for planck , the systematic biases become significant for values of @xmath105 and for @xmath106 .",
    "our analysis therefore suggests that at the highest frequencies , and in clean regions of the sky , map should provide unbiased estimates of cosmological parameters without any correction for foregrounds . for planck ,",
    "removal of foregrounds is likely to be required to achieve unbiased results .",
    "however , with the wide frequency coverage and high sensitivity of planck it should be possible to remove foreground contributions to @xmath4 to an accuracy that is well below the cosmic variance errors ( tegmark and efstathiou 1996 ) . even without any frequency information ,",
    "it would be possible to test for biases by including parametric models of the systematic errors in the likelihood analysis .",
    "figure [ figure13 ] shows that for planck , low - level scanning errors could potentially lead to biases in cosmological parameters .",
    "these biases could probably be removed adequately by including a parametric model of the scanning errors derived from simulations such as those described by delabrouille ( 1998 ) .",
    "the example of figure [ figure13 ] does , however , show that scanning errors may be a serious concern for the analysis of planck data .",
    "4.5 truein    3.0 truein",
    "in practice , observations of the cmb anisotropies will be supplemented by other astronomical observations which can be used to remove some of the parameter degeneracies .",
    "some of these are described in this section .",
    "indeed , such constraints have already been applied in some analysis of cosmological parameters .",
    "for example , webster ( 1998 ) describe joint likelihood analysis of cmb measurements and observations of large - scale structure .",
    "white ( 1998 ) and tegmark ( 1998 )  describe how cmb measurements can be combined with distances derived from type 1a supernovae ( _ e.g. _ perlmutter 1997 , 1998 ) to remove the geometrical degeneracy .      if the matter content parameters @xmath107 and @xmath40 are well constrained by cmb observations , a constraint on the hubble constant converts directly into a constraint on @xmath44 . for our spatially flat target model ,",
    "the constraint is given by equation ( [ eq:12 ] ) and generally , @xmath108 a determination of @xmath44 to an accuracy of @xmath109 should be possible if the systematic and random errors on the hubble constant can be reduced to @xmath110 , as seems feasible ( see _ e.g. _ freedman 1998 ) .",

    "if the matter content @xmath107 is well constrained by the cmb anisotropies , then limits on the age of the universe can be used to constrain the geometrical degeneracy in the @xmath112 ",
    "@xmath113 plane .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ figure14 ] .",
    "however , since the slope of the geometrical lines are so steep , the limits on @xmath112 are sensitive to the parameters of the target model . in the example shown in figure [ figure14 ] , an age constraint of @xmath114 gyr ( _ e.g. _ chaboyer 1996 ) would lead to a relatively weak limit of @xmath115 in a spatially flat universe ( @xmath116 ) , but to tighter limits in a universe with a larger value of @xmath113 .",
    "3.0 truein      measurements of galaxy clustering can provide constraints on the shape and amplitude of the galaxy power spectrum .",
    "these are often characterised by the _",
    "rms _ amplitude of the galaxy fluctuations in spheres of radius @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and a shape parameter @xmath119 ( see efstathiou , bond and white 1992 ) . when combined with cmb anisotropy measurements , observation of galaxy clustering can constrain the distribution of mass fluctuations relative to galaxies . this information , together with constraints on redshift space anisotropies and cosmic velocity fields , can be used to improve the estimates of many of the cosmological parameters described here and including the epoch of reionization ( see for example tegmark 1997b ) . in the future",
    ", observations of weak gravitational lensing may provide more direct estimates of the matter power spectrum ( blandford 1991 , miralda - escude 1991 , kaiser 1992 , see seljak 1997b for a recent discussion ) .",
    "if we restrict to cdm models with low baryon fractions , then the power spectrum shape parameter @xmath119 is related to the matter density according to @xmath120 ( see eisenstein and hu , 1998 , equations 30 and 31 for a fitting function for @xmath119 that includes the baryon density and associated scale dependence ) .",
    "a measurement of @xmath119 from large - scale structure measurements can thus be combined with an accurate determination of @xmath107 from the cmb anisotropies to yield an estimate of the hubble constant , and hence to constrain the cosmological constant as described in section [ sec:6.1 ] .",
    "the distances of type 1a supernovae at redshifts @xmath121 are already providing strong constraints on the geometry of the universe ( _ e.g. _ perlmutter 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "such measurements provide a potentially powerful method of removing the geometrical degeneracy in the cmb measurements .",
    "this is illustrated by figure [ figure15 ] , which shows the cmb geometrical degeneracy lines in the @xmath44@xmath122 plane plotted as in figure [ figure1]a .",
    "the dashed lines show constant values of the luminosity distance at @xmath123 , approximating the slope of the error ellipses in this plane derived from supernovae measurements . to first order , standard candles such as type 1a supernovae yield near degenerate constraints along the dashed lines .",
    "as has been noted as well by white ( 1998 ) , tegmark ( 1998 ) and others , these intersect almost orthogonally with the cmb geometrical degeneracy lines .",
    "type 1a supernovae thus offer an extremely powerful way of breaking the geometrical degeneracy , provided systematic errors ( which move the supernova maximum likelihood almost along the geometrical degeneracy lines ) can be shown to be small .",
    "high precision observations of cmb anisotropies promise a revolution in our knowledge of fundamental cosmological parameters . in this paper",
    "we have analysed the degeneracies between cosmological parameters determined from cmb experiments , using the map and planck satellites as an indication of what might be achieved in the next decade .",
    "our conclusions are as follows :    [ 1 ] the geometrical degeneracy between @xmath44 and @xmath122 for models with identical matter content , @xmath76 , @xmath73 , @xmath124 is nearly exact and can not be broken from observations of the linear cmb anisotropies alone . breaking of",
    "this degeneracy requires additional data , such as distances to type 1a supenovae , or the detection of small non - linear effects such as gravitational lensing of the cmb .",
    "[ 2 ] small numerical errors in calculating the cmb power spectrum @xmath4 can accumulate in computations of the fisher matrix leading to spurious breaking of near exact degeneracies .",

    "if our simple models are correct , foregrounds should not introduce large biases in cosmological parameters estimated from cmb measurements at frequencies in the range @xmath127@xmath128ghz .",
    "however , there may be foreground components that are not included in our model and that dominate in this frequency range ( _ e.g. _ leitch 1997 ) . in this case ,",
    "subtraction of the frequency dependent foregrounds from the primary anisotropies to high accuracy may be necessary to derive cosmological parameter estimates from the cmb .",
    "scanning errors are another potential source of biases in cosmological parameter estimates .",
    "our models suggest that scanning errors may be problematic for planck and a more detailed analysis is evidently required before the scanning strategy is frozen .",
    "[ 9 ] observations of cmb anisotropies can be supplemented with more conventional astronomical measurements , such as the large - scale mass distribution , estimates of the age of the universe and distances to type 1a supernovae , to break the geometrical degeneracy .",

    "<S> in the near future , observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies will provide accurate determinations of many fundamental cosmological parameters . in this paper , we analyse degeneracies among cosmological parameters to illustrate some of the limitations inherent in cmb parameter estimation . for simplicity , throughout our analysis </S>",
    "<S> we assume a cold dark matter universe with power - law adiabatic scalar and tensor fluctuation spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we show that most of the variance in cosmological parameter estimates is contributed by a small number ( two or three ) principal components . </S>",
    "<S> an exact likelihood analysis shows that the usual fisher matrix approach can significantly overestimate the errors on cosmological parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we show that small correlated errors in estimates of the cmb power spectrum at levels well below the cosmic variance limits , ( caused , for example , by galactic foregrounds or scanning errors ) can lead to significant biases in cosmological parameters . </S>",
    "<S> estimates of cosmological parameters can be improved very significantly by applying theoretical restrictions to the tensor component and external constraints derived from more conventional astronomical observations such as measurements of he hubble constant , type 1a supernovae distances and observations of galaxy clustering and peculiar velocities . </S>"
