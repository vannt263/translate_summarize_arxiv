    "symplectic field theory ( sft ) is a very general theory of holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds which was outlined by eliashberg , givental and hofer @xcite , and whose analytical foundations are currently under development by hofer , wysocki and zehnder , cf .",
    "it contains as special cases several theories that have been shown to have powerful consequences in contact topology  notably contact homology and gromov - witten theory  but the more elaborate structure of `` full '' sft has yet to find application , as it is usually far too complicated to compute .",
    "our goal here is to introduce a numerical invariant , which we call _ algebraic torsion _",
    ", that is extracted from the full sft algebra and whose finiteness gives obstructions to the existence of symplectic fillings and exact symplectic cobordisms .",
    "algebraic torsion is defined in all dimensions , and we illustrate its effectiveness by proving explicit nonexistence results for exact symplectic cobordisms whose ends are certain prescribed nonfillable contact @xmath2-manifolds , see corollary  [ cor : noexact ] below . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "results of this type are new and seem to be beyond the present reach of more topologically oriented methods such as heegaard floer homology .    from the point of view taken in this paper , which is adapted from @xcite and described in more detail in  [ sec : sft ] , the sft of a contact manifold @xmath7 is the homology @xmath8 of a @xmath9-graded @xmath10-algebra @xmath11,{\\mathbf{d}_{{\\text{sft}}}})$ ] , where @xmath12 has generators @xmath13 for each good closed reeb orbit  @xmath14 with respect to some nondegenerate contact form for @xmath15 , @xmath16 is an even variable , and the operator @xmath17 \\to { { \\mathcal a}}[[\\hbar]]\\ ] ] is defined by counting rigid solutions to a suitable abstract perturbation of a @xmath18-holomorphic curve equation in the symplectization of @xmath7 .",
    "the domains for these solutions are punctured closed riemann surfaces , and near the punctures the solutions have so - called positive or negative cylindrical ends .",
    "it follows from the exactness of the symplectic form in the symplectization that all such curves must have at least one positive end .",
    "algebraically , this translates into the fact that the ground ring @xmath19 $ ] of @xmath12 consists of closed elements with respect to @xmath20 .",
    "this motivates the following :    let @xmath7 be a closed manifold of dimension @xmath21 with a positive , co - oriented contact structure . for any integer @xmath22 , we say that @xmath7 has _ algebraic torsion of order  @xmath5 _ ( or simply _ algebraic @xmath5-torsion",

    "note that although the version of sft described in @xcite has coefficients in the group ring of @xmath24 , the homology @xmath8 above is defined without group ring coefficients  one can always do this at the cost of reducing the usual @xmath25-grading to a @xmath9-grading ( see  [ sec : sft ] for details ) .",
    "we will introduce group ring coefficients later to obtain a more refined invariant , cf .  definition  [ defn : twistedtorsion ] .    in order to state our first main result",
    ", we need a few standard concepts .",
    "recall that a strong symplectic filling of a contact manifold @xmath7 is a compact symplectic manifold @xmath26 with @xmath27 for which there exists a vector field @xmath28 , defined near the boundary and pointing transversely outward there , with @xmath29 ( i.e.  @xmath28 is a _",
    "liouville _ vector field ) and such that @xmath30 is a contact form for @xmath15 giving the correct co - orientation .",
    "more generally , a symplectic cobordism with positive end @xmath31 and negative end @xmath32 is a compact symplectic manifold @xmath26 with boundary @xmath33 and a vector field as above with @xmath34 , with the difference that @xmath28 is required to point outward only along @xmath35 and inward along @xmath36 .",
    "note that since @xmath37 , the symplectic form is always exact near the boundary of a symplectic cobordism , though it need not be exact globally .",
    "the flow of @xmath28 can be used to identify a neighborhood of @xmath38 with @xmath39 { \\times}m^+,d(e^s(\\iota_y\\omega)|_{m^+})),\\ ] ] and so any symplectic cobordism in the above sense can be _ completed _ by gluing a positive half of the symplectization of @xmath31 and a negative half of the symplectization of @xmath32 to the respective boundaries .",
    "holomorphic curves in completed symplectic cobordisms are the main object of study in sft , with the symplectization @xmath40 being an important special case of a completed symplectic cobordism .",
    "a symplectic cobordism @xmath26 is called _ exact _ if the vector field  @xmath28 as described above extends globally over  @xmath41 ; equivalently , this means @xmath42 for a @xmath3-form @xmath43 on  @xmath41 whose restrictions to @xmath44 define contact forms for @xmath45 . from the above definition of algebraic torsion and the general formalism of sft , we draw the following consequence , which is our first main result and is proven in ",
    "[ sec : sft ] .",
    "[ thm : obstructions ] if @xmath7 has algebraic torsion then it is not strongly fillable .",
    "moreover , suppose there is an exact symplectic cobordism having contact manifolds @xmath31 and @xmath32 as positive and negative ends respectively : then if @xmath31 has algebraic @xmath5-torsion , so does @xmath32 .",
    "[ remark : disclaimer ] it is time for a more or less standard disclaimer : all the theorems regarding sft that we shall state in this introduction depend on the analytical foundations of sft , which remains a large project in progress by hofer , wysocki and zehnder ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the main technical difficulty which is the subject of their work is to establish a sufficiently well behaved abstract perturbation scheme so that @xmath46 is well defined and the natural maps induced by counting solutions to a perturbed holomorphic curve equation in symplectic cobordisms exist . we shall take it for granted throughout the following that such a perturbation scheme exists and has the properties that its architects claim ( cf .  remark  [ remark : abstract])the further details of this scheme will be irrelevant to our arguments .",
    "note however that our main applications , corollaries  [ cor : noexact ] and  [ cor : noexactgeometric ] , can also be proved using the embedded contact homology techniques described in the appendix ( cf .",

    "[ remark : weinstein ] algebraic torsion has some obvious applications beyond those that we will consider in this paper , e.g.  it is immediate from the formalism of sft discussed in  [ sec : sft ] that any contact manifold with algebraic torsion satisfies the weinstein conjecture .",
    "the simplest example of algebraic torsion is the case @xmath47 : we will show in  [ sec : sft ] ( proposition  [ prop : algot ] ) that this is equivalent to @xmath7 having trivial contact homology , in which case it is called _ algebraically overtwisted _ , cf .",
    "this is the case , for instance , whenever @xmath7 is an overtwisted contact @xmath2-manifold , and in higher dimensions it has been shown to hold whenever @xmath7 contains a _ plastikstufe _",
    "@xcite , or when @xmath7 is a connected sum with a certain exotic contact sphere @xcite",
    ".    in dimension three , there are also many known examples of contact manifolds that are tight but not fillable . an important class of examples is the following : @xmath7 is said to have _ giroux torsion _ if it admits a contact embedding of @xmath48 , \\xi_t)$ ] where @xmath49\\ ] ] in coordinates @xmath50 = s^1 \\times s^1 \\times [ 0,1]$ ] .",
    "it was shown by d.  gay @xcite that contact @xmath2-manifolds with giroux torsion are never strongly fillable , and a computation of the twisted ozsvth - szab contact invariant due to ghiggini and honda @xcite shows that giroux torsion is also an obstruction to weak fillings whenever the submanifold @xmath51 \\subset m$ ] separates  @xmath52 .",
    "there are obvious examples of manifolds with these properties that are also tight .",
    "on @xmath53 for example with coordinates @xmath54 , the contact form @xmath55 has giroux torsion for any integer @xmath56 , but it also has no contractible reeb orbits , which implies that its contact homology can not vanish . the original motivation for this project was to find an algebraic interpretation of giroux torsion that implies nonfillability .",
    "the solution to this problem is the following result , which is implied by the more general theorem  [ thm : torsion ] below :    [ thm : giroux ] if @xmath7 is a contact @xmath2-manifold with giroux torsion , then it has algebraic @xmath3-torsion .",
    "while it is possible that `` overtwisted '' and `` algebraically overtwisted '' could be equivalent notions in dimension three , it turns out that the converse of theorem  [ thm : giroux ] is not true .",
    "we will show this using a special class of contact manifolds constructed as follows : assume @xmath57 and @xmath58 are compact ( not necessarily connected ) oriented surfaces with nonempty diffeomorphic boundaries , and denote by @xmath59 the closed oriented surface obtained by gluing them along some orientation reversing diffeomorphism @xmath60 .",
    "we shall assume  @xmath61 to be connected .",

    "it is easy to find examples ( see figure  [ fig : disconnected ] ) for which both these conditions are satisfied , as well as the assumption in the following result :    [ thm : nogiroux ] if either of @xmath57 or @xmath58 is disconnected , then the @xmath65-invariant contact manifold @xmath70 described above has algebraic @xmath3-torsion . in particular , there exist contact @xmath2-manifolds that have algebraic @xmath3-torsion but no giroux torsion .",
    "theorem  [ thm : obstructions ] implies that the examples in theorem  [ thm : nogiroux ] are not strongly fillable .",
    "the latter has been established previously via vanishing results for the ozsvth - szab contact invariant in sutured floer homology , see @xcite .",

    "examples showing that algebraic torsion is interesting for all orders can be constructed in almost the same way . in the construction of @xmath65-invariant contact manifolds @xmath73 above ,",
    "assume that @xmath62 are both connected with @xmath74 boundary components , and that @xmath58 has genus 0 and @xmath57 has genus @xmath75 .",
    "the surface @xmath61 obtained by gluing will have genus @xmath76 .",
    "we denote the resulting contact manifold by @xmath77 .",
    "we then obtain :    [ thm : higherorder ] @xmath78 has algebraic torsion of order @xmath6 , but not @xmath79 .",
    "the proof that @xmath78 has algebraic torsion of order  @xmath6 will be a consequence of theorem  [ thm : torsion ] below , which relates algebraic torsion in dimension 3 to the geometric notion of _ planar torsion _ recently introduced by the second author  @xcite .",
    "this is discussed in detail in  [",
    "sec : planar ] .",
    "the proof that there is no algebraic torsion of lower order occupies a large part of  [ sec : higherorder ] .",
    "it is based on a combination of algebraic properties of sft and a construction of certain explicit contact forms for the contact structures @xmath80 , for which the reeb dynamics and the holomorphic curves can be understood sufficiently well .",

    "[ remark : nonexact ] the inclusion of the word `` exact '' in the above corollary is crucial , as a recent construction due to the second author @xcite shows that non - exact symplectic cobordisms exist between _ any _ two contact @xmath2-manifolds with planar torsion .    [ remark : jeremy1 ] sometimes exact cobordisms are known to exist when the negative end has a smaller order of algebraic torsion than the positive end , e.g.  etnyre and honda @xcite have shown that _ any _ positive end is allowed if the negative end is overtwisted ( meaning @xmath1-torsion , in the present context ) .",
    "similarly , jeremy van horn - morris has explained to us that a stein cobordism with negative end @xmath78 and positive end @xmath86 does always exist ; cf .",
    "remark  [ remark : jeremy2 ] in  [ sec : higherorder ] for an outline of the construction .",
    "together with corollary  [ cor : noexact ] , this gives infinite sequences of contact 3-manifolds such that each is exactly cobordant to its successor , but not vice versa .",
    "[ remark : hofer ] the case @xmath87 of corollary  [ cor : noexact ] can be deduced already from the argument used by hofer @xcite to prove the weinstein conjecture for overtwisted contact structures .",
    "indeed , @xmath83 is always overtwisted if @xmath87 , and transplanting hofer s argument from the symplectization to an exact symplectic cobordism shows that @xmath84 must then have a contractible reeb orbit for all nondegenerate contact forms , which is easily shown to be false if @xmath88 . in this sense ,",
    "the obstructions coming from algebraic torsion may be seen as a `` higher order '' generalization of hofer s argument , which incidentally was the starting point for the developement of sft .    to obtain a more sensitive invariant",

    "thus sft also gives obstructions to weak filling in all dimensions , where the distinction between `` strong '' and `` weak '' is detected algebraically via the choice of coefficients .",
    "as already mentioned , the second author @xcite recently introduced a new class of filling obstructions in dimension three called _ planar torsion _ , which also has a nonnegative integer - valued _",
