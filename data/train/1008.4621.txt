    "[ fig.1dlihdensity ] reveals the picture of the xuv induced electron dynamics over more than three laser cycles as obtained from tdse ( top ) , time - dependent [ self - consistent ] second born approximation ( center ) and time - dependent hartree - fock approximation ( bottom ) .",
    "thereby , we have used an fe - dvr basis of size @xmath179 and a simulation box of @xmath180 . as general trend",
    ", we observe , in @xmath181 , that td2ndb is considerably superior to tdhf . in particular , the time - dependent density between the li and the h atom behaves completely different than tdse in the case of tdhf , see e.g.  the density around @xmath182 for @xmath183 and @xmath184 indicated by arrows .",
    "this is essentially corrected in td2ndb approximation .    for specific times",

    "[ fig.1dlihdensity2 ] allows for a direct and more detailed comparison of the exact and approximate one - electron densities close to the atomic nuclei . as in fig .",
    "[ fig.dt ] , td2ndb@xmath129 ( dashed - dotted line ) means that the initial state is uncorrelated [ thus on the hartree - fock level ] , while td2ndb@xmath128 ( dashed line ) refers to self - consistent ground state preparation .",
    "following the time - evolution , td2ndb@xmath128 leads to the correct changes towards the tdse solution including strong depopulation of electrons around the hydrogen atom for @xmath185 . also , the td2ndb@xmath128 density is more smooth whereas tdhf shows additional maxima being absent in , both , td2ndb approximation and the exact result ( dashed - dot - dotted line ) , see e.g.  the density for @xmath186 at @xmath187 .",
    "in addition , we observe that starting from the correlated ( td2ndb@xmath128 ) or uncorrelated ground state ( td2ndb@xmath129 ) does not make much density difference for later propagation times @xmath188 . averaging over coordinate space allows us , moreover , to trace the time - dependent expectation value of the electron position @xmath167 which , being initially close to the li nucleus , starts to oscillate with the xuv field , cf .  the gray lines in fig .  [ fig.1dlihdensity2 ] .",
    "thereby , td2ndb , again , gives consistent results , although , for later times , deviations to tdse increase . to this end",
    ", we note that the solution of the full four - particle tdse could have been performed only with restricted spatial resolution whereas the negf results are converged .",
    "thus , comparisons should be drawn carefully . nevertheless , for confirming the main trends [ when e - e correlations are being included in the negf calculation ] , the tdse result is fully adequate .",

    "starting from initial states with different degrees of e - e correlation and self - consistency , it has been shown that negfs are well applicable to resolve the time dependence and that dynamic correlation effects are approximated to a substantial and valuable level already in the case of td2ndb .",
    "this is obtained from ( i ) analyzing the few - cycle ( one - electron ) density response of he and lih to strong laser fields and ( ii ) from exploring spectral properties such as the singly - excited spectrum of 1d he , cf .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "overall , results at td2ndb level are found to be closer to exact solutions of the tdse than to tdhf . thereby , the present restriction of negf calculations to examples of two- and four - electron systems stems from the availability of exact reference data which allows for a proof of principle .",
    "exact solutions of the tdse for @xmath189 are essentially at the limit concerning spatial resolution whereas a solution of the skkbes is not explicitly sensitive to the particle number .",
    "this potential of direct extension to larger model atoms or molecules [ where exact calculations are impossible ] affirms the power of the present negf approach .",
