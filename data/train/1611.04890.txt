    "in the past decades , a considerable amount of effort has been devoted to understand a formation of an inhomogeneous charge and spin stripe order in strongly correlated electron systems as well as its relation to superconductivity .",
    "the motivation was clearly due to the observation of such an ordering in doped nickelate  @xcite , cuprate  @xcite and cobaltate  @xcite materials , some of which constitute materials that exhibit high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "the hubbard and @xmath5 models have been used the most frequently in the literature to study the problem of stripe formation  @xcite .",
    "these studies showed on two possible explanations of formation of inhomogeneous spatial charge and spin ordering . according to the first explanation the stripe phases arise from a competition between the tendency to phase separate ( the natural tendency of the system ) and the long - range coulomb interaction  @xcite .",
    "contrary to this explanation , white and scalapino proposed  @xcite a new mechanism that does not require the long - range interactions and according to which the stripe order arises from a competition between kinetic and exchange energies . much simpler mechanism of a charge stripe formation in strongly correlated systems has been found by lemanski et al .",
    "@xcite within the spinless falicov - kimball model ( fkm ) .",
    "this model  @xcite combines only the kinetic energy of itinerant @xmath3 electrons with the on - site coulomb interaction between the itinerant @xmath3 and localized @xmath2 electrons and thus various types of charge orderings determined within this model for different @xmath2 and @xmath3 electron dopings are simply a compromise between these two tendencies .",
    "however , the spinless version of the fkm , although non - trivial , is not able to account for all aspects of real experiments .",
    "for example , many experiments show that a charge superstructure is accompanied by a magnetic superstructure  @xcite . in order to describe both types of ordering in the unified picture lemanski",
    "@xcite proposed a simple model based on a generalization of the spin - one - half fkm that besides the local coulomb interaction between @xmath2 and @xmath3 electrons takes into account also the anisotropic , spin - dependent local interaction ( of the ising type ) that couples the localized and itinerant subsystems .",
    "it was found that this model is able to describe various types of charge and spin orderings observed experimentally in strongly correlated systems , including the diagonal and axial charge stripes with antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic arrangement of spins within the lines .    in spite of this fact , the extended model is still oversimplified to describe all details of real materials .",
    "the major simplification consists of omitting the hubbard interaction @xmath6 between the itinerant electrons of opposite spins that is crucial if one interests , for example , in the superconducting correlations in the system . since the main goal of this paper is to examine the impact of charge and spin superstructures on the superconducting correlations we have extended the lemanski s model by the hubbard interaction term . from this point of view , the model considered here , for a description of superconducting correlations in the strongly correlated system , is the spin - one - half fkm extended by the anisotropic spin - dependent interband interaction of the ising type ( between @xmath2 and @xmath3 electrons ) and the intraband coulomb interaction of the hubbard type that acts between two @xmath3 ( @xmath2 ) electrons of opposite spins .    it should be noted that despite an enormous research activity in the past the relation between the charge / spin ordering and the superconductivity is still controversial ( an excellent review of relevant works dealing with this subject can be found in  @xcite ) .",
    "a considerable progress in this field has been achieved recently by maier et al .",
    "@xcite and mondaini et al .",
    "both groups studied the two - dimensional hubbard model , in which stripes are introduced externally by applying a spatially varying local potential @xmath7 , and they found a significant enhancement of the d - wave pairing correlations .",
    "however , it should be noted that the potential @xmath7 is phenomenological and as such has no direct microscopic origin that corresponds to a degree of freedom in the actual materials .",
    "the advantage of our approach , based on the generalized spin - one - half fkm with @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath6 interactions is that the charge / spin stripes are present in the model intrinsically , even in its @xmath8 limit .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model considered in this paper has the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the creation and annihilation operators for an electron of spin @xmath11 in the localized state at lattice site @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the creation and annihilation operators of the itinerant electrons in the @xmath3-band wannier state at site  @xmath12 .",
    "the first term of ( 1 ) is the kinetic energy corresponding to quantum - mechanical hopping of the itinerant @xmath3 electrons between sites @xmath12 and @xmath14 .",
    "these intersite hopping transitions are described by the matrix elements @xmath15 , which are @xmath16 if @xmath12 and @xmath14 are the nearest neighbours and zero otherwise .",
    "the second term represents the on - site coulomb interaction between the @xmath3-band electrons with density @xmath17 and the localized @xmath2 electrons with density @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "the third term is the above mentioned anisotropic , spin - dependent local interaction of the ising type between the localized and itinerant electrons that reflects the hund s rule force . and finally , the last term is the ordinary hubbard interaction term for the itinerant electrons from the @xmath3 band .",
    "moreover , it is assumed that the on - site coulomb interaction between @xmath2 electrons is infinite and so the double occupancy of @xmath2 orbitals is forbidden .",
    "this model has several different physical interpretations that depends on its application .",
    "as was already mentioned above , it can be considered as the spin - one - half fkm extended by the hund and hubbard interaction term . on the other hand , it can be also considered as the hubbard model in the external potential generated by the spin - independent falicov - kimball term and the anisotropic spin - dependent hund term .",
    "very popular interpretation of the model hamiltonian ( 1 ) is its @xmath20 version that has been introduced by lemanski  @xcite who considered it as the minimal model of charge and magnetic ordering in coupled electron and spin systems .",
    "its attraction consists in this that without the hubbard interaction term @xmath20 the hamiltonian ( 1 ) can be reduced to the single particle hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , using the fact that the @xmath2-electron occupation number @xmath21 of each site @xmath12 commutes with the hamiltonian ( 1 ) , it can be replaced by the classical variable @xmath22 taking only two values : @xmath23 or 0 , according to whether or not the site @xmath12 is occupied by the localized @xmath2 electron and so the hamiltonian ( 1 ) in absence of @xmath6 term can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( we remember that the double occupancy of @xmath2 orbitals is forbidden ) and @xmath28 .",
    "thus for a given @xmath2-electron @xmath29 and spin configuration @xmath30 the investigation of the model ( 2 ) is reduced to the investigation of the spectrum of @xmath31 for different @xmath2 electron / spin distributions .",
    "this can be performed exactly , over the full set of @xmath2-electron / spin distributions or approximatively .",
    "one such approximative method has been introduced in our previous papers  @xcite and it was shown that it is very effective in description of ground - state properties of the model hamiltonian ( 2 ) and its extensions . the method consists of the following steps : i ) chose a trial configuration @xmath32 .",
    "( ii ) having @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the total number of electrons @xmath33 fixed , find all eigenvalues @xmath34 of @xmath31 .",
    "( iii ) for a given @xmath35 determine the ground - state energy @xmath36 of a particular @xmath2-electron / spin configuration by filling in the lowest @xmath37 one - electron levels @xmath34 .",
    "( iv ) generate a new configuration @xmath38 by moving a randomly chosen electron to a new position which is chosen also as random ( or equivalently by flipping the randomly chosen spin ) .",
    "( v ) calculate the ground - state energy @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath40 the new configuration is accepted , otherwise @xmath38 is rejected .",
    "then the steps ( ii)-(v ) are repeated until the convergence ( for given @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) is reached .",
    "of course , one can move ( flip ) instead of one electron in step ( iv ) simultaneously two or more electrons ( spins ) , thereby the convergence of method is improved . for the @xmath41 case studied in the current paper we use the quantum variant of this method , that differs from the classical one only in the step ( iii ) where the ground state energy of the full hamiltonian ( 1 ) has to be calculated now by a quantum method . here",
    "we used the exact diagonalization lanczos method  @xcite for clusters less than @xmath42 sites and the projector quantum monte carlo method  @xcite for larger clusters .",
    "having the actual charge and spin distributions that minimize the ground state energy of the model hamiltonian ( 1 ) all ground state observables can be calculated immediately . in the current paper",
    "we focus our attention to the problem of superconducting correlations in the ground state .",
    "especially we study the influence of the spin - independent coulomb interaction @xmath0 ( the charge ordering ) and the anisotropic spin - dependent interaction @xmath1 ( the spin ordering ) on the superconducting correlation function with @xmath43 wave symmetry defined as  @xcite    @xmath44    where the factors @xmath45 are 1 in x - direction and -1 in y - direction and the sums with respect to @xmath46 are independent sums over the nearest neighbors of site @xmath12 .",
    "however , on small clusters the above defined correlation function is not a good measure for superconducting correlations , since contains also contributions from the one particle correlation functions @xmath47 that yield nonzero contributions to @xmath48 even in the noninteracting case .",
    "for this reason we use as the true measure for superconductivity the vertex correlation function @xmath49    and its average    @xmath50",
    "we have started our study with the case @xmath51 , that is slightly simpler from the numerical point of view , since in this case it is necessary to work only with the charge degrees of freedom . unlike previous studies  @xcite , that have been done exclusively for @xmath8",
    ", we consider here also the hubbard interaction term with the intraband coulomb interacting @xmath52 . to reveal effects of the interband coulomb interaction between localized and itinerant electrons @xmath0 on the formation of the various types of charge ordering , we have analyzed model for a wide range of @xmath0 values ( @xmath53 ) at all possible combinations of half and quarter @xmath2 and @xmath3 electron fillings on cluster of @xmath54 sites .",
    "the results of our numerical calculations obtained within the method described in detail above are summarized in fig .  1 .",
    "there is displayed the complete list of @xmath2-electron configurations that minimize ground state energy of the model for different values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .     at different values of the interband coulomb interaction @xmath0 and different @xmath2 and @xmath3 electron filings : a ) @xmath57 ; b ) @xmath58 ; c ) @xmath59 ; d ) @xmath60 . here",
    "the dark circles represent the @xmath2 electrons and dots the empty sites.,width=604 ]    analysing these results one can see some general trends in formation of charge ordering . for sufficiently large @xmath0",
    "there is an obvious tendency to the phase separation for all examined @xmath2 and @xmath3 electron fillings , while in the opposite limit there is a tendency to form the axial stripes ( for @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) or regularly distributed `` n - molecules '' of @xmath2-electrons for ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) . between these three basic types of ground state configurations",
    "there is a limited number of intermediate phases through which the low @xmath0 phases transform to high @xmath0 ones .    of course",
    ", the charge ordering in the @xmath2-electron subsystem will have the strong impact on the @xmath3 electrons . to show what happens with the @xmath3 electrons we have calculated directly the @xmath3-electron on - site occupation @xmath65 for several representative @xmath2-electron distributions from fig .  1",
    ", including the regular , phase separated and axial striped phases .",
    "-electron on - site occupation @xmath65 calculated for selected @xmath2-electron configurations from fig .  1 .",
    "the case a ) corresponds to @xmath57 and the case d ) to @xmath60 .",
    "the on - site occupation @xmath66 is represented by filled - circles ( @xmath67 ) , where the radius of circle on site @xmath12 is proportional to @xmath66.,width=453 ]    it is seen ( see fig .",
    "2 ) that @xmath3 and @xmath2 electrons exhibit the inverse site occupancy , which is obviously a consequence of the local coulomb interaction @xmath0 that prefers states without double @xmath3-@xmath2 site occupancy . as a result ,",
    "the majority of @xmath3 electrons reside on the empty sites and only a fraction of them ( due to the quantum mechanical hopping ) share the same sites with @xmath2 electrons .",
    "this leads not only to the inverse @xmath2 and @xmath3 site occupancy , but also to the inverse charge patterns in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 electron subsystems and thus the axial stripes ( the phase separation ) in the @xmath2 electron subsystem are accompanied by the axial stripes ( the phase separation ) in the @xmath3-electron subsystem .",
    "for @xmath63 the average vertex correlation function exhibits extremely different behaviour in regions of stability of the regular phase with the 4-molecules and the phase separated ground state . while in the first case",
    ", the correlation function is small and with increasing @xmath0 changes only slowly , in the second case it is significantly enhanced at the phase boundary and further increases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "a fully different picture is observed for @xmath61 . here",
    "the average vertex correlation function sharply increases with increasing @xmath0 within the axial striped phase , then slowly decreases within the intermediate phases and it is again enhanced in the phase separated region . for @xmath64 the system exhibits a similar behaviour as for @xmath63 with an exception that the vertex correlations in the separated phase are now four times larger than in the @xmath63 case . in the last case @xmath62 the average vertex correlation function changes slowly for both the axial striped as well regular phase , but it is enhanced dramatically in the separated phase .",
    "this enhancement is by the factor 6 , in comparison to the @xmath61 and @xmath68 phases and even by the factor 25 for the @xmath63 phase , what emphasizes the role of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) electron doping on the superconducting correlations .",
    "thus we can conclude that the separated and axial striped phases enhance the average vertex correlations in the spin - one - half fkm with @xmath69 and @xmath6 couplings , while the regular phases have only a small impact on the @xmath43 superconducting correlations in this model .",
    "unfortunately , for half and quarter @xmath2 and @xmath3 electron fillings analysed above we have found no pure axial striped phases , as observed in the experiments for some cuprate , nikelate and cobaltate systems and therefore we turn our attention to the case @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where such phases have been widely observed for both @xmath51 as well as @xmath72 , even in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite    the results of our nonzero @xmath6 calculations are presented in fig .  4 for @xmath73 and @xmath74 . comparing these results with ones obtained in our previous paper  @xcite for @xmath8 , and the same values of @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ", one can see that they are identical practically for all examined @xmath2 electron concentrations for both @xmath75 and @xmath76 .     and",
    "different values of the @xmath2-electron concentrations at ( a ) @xmath77 and ( b ) @xmath78 . here",
    "the spin up ( down ) of the @xmath2 electron is represented by a filled regular triangle ( open inverted triangle).,width=604 ]    the exceptions have been observed only for @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( @xmath75 ) , where slightly different types of the ground states have been identified for @xmath8 and @xmath81 .",
    "this independently confirms the supposition made in our previous papers  @xcite , based on the small cluster exact diagonalization calculations , and namely that in the strong interaction @xmath0 limit ( @xmath82 ) , the ground states of the model found for @xmath8 persist as ground states also for nonzero @xmath6 , up to relatively large values ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "let us now summarize our numerical results for the ground states .",
    "( i ) in all examined cases the ground states of the model ( 1 ) are non - polarized ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) for both the @xmath70 as well as @xmath71 line .",
    "( ii ) for @xmath70 the ground states are either the regular distributions of @xmath2 electrons ( @xmath86 ) or the axial striped configurations , some of which can be phase separated ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) .",
    "( iii ) for @xmath71 only the axial striped configurations are the ground states of the model , and the phase separation is observed only for @xmath89 .",
    "the average vertex correlation functions calculated for a complete list of ground state configurations from fig .  4 are shown in fig .  5 ( @xmath75 ) and fig .  6 ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "to see the enhancement of superconducting correlations due to the interband coulomb @xmath0 and spin @xmath1 interaction against the ordinary hubbard model with @xmath52 we have plotted @xmath90 for both @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "one can see that the superconducting correlations for @xmath75 are considerably enhanced for @xmath94 and @xmath95 , while they are practically unchanged for @xmath86 .",
    "the ground state configurations for @xmath96 and @xmath95 are either phase separated or axially striped and thus the enhancement of superconducting correlations in these phases is in accordance with our results discussed above for half and quarter @xmath2 and @xmath3 electron fillings . in accordance with these conclusions , it is also the result obtained for @xmath86 . in this case",
    "the pairs of @xmath2-electrons are distributed regularly over the whole two - dimensional lattice and thus the suppression of superconducting correlations is expected .",
    "a fully different picture is observed for @xmath76 , where the superconducting correlations are enhanced for all examined values of @xmath2-electron concentrations and they sharply increase with @xmath2-electron doping ( for example , for @xmath88 they are enhanced by a factor 20 in comparison to the @xmath97 and @xmath51 case ) . for all examined @xmath93",
    "the ground states are the axially striped phases and thus these results are also consistent with our above mentioned conclusions .       as a function of @xmath93 calculated for corresponding ground states from fig .  4 at @xmath91 ( the dashed line ) and @xmath98 ( the dash - dotted line ) for both @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the enhancement @xmath99 corresponds to the ratio of the average vertex correlation functions with and without the ising coupling @xmath1 , @xmath100.,width=529 ]    it is seen that the hund constant suppresses the superconducting correlations for @xmath75 , the most obviously for @xmath86 , while in the case @xmath76 the nonzero @xmath1 enhances considerably superconducting correlations .",
    "comparing the types of spin arrangement within the axial phases for @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the reason for such a different behaviour seems to be obvious .",
    "while for @xmath75 the spins are arranged ferromagnetically within the individual lines , for @xmath76 they are arranged antiferromagnetically .",
    "this implies that the antiferromagnetic correlations within the axial stripes enhance the superconducting correlations in the @xmath43 channel , while the ferromagnetic ones has the opposite effect .    in summary ,",
    "the projector quantum monte carlo method is used to examine effects of the interband coulomb interaction @xmath0 and the anisotropic spin - dependent interband interaction @xmath1 on the stability of various types of charge / spin ordering and superconducting correlations in the two - dimensional spin - one - half fkm with hund and hubbard coupling .",
    "it is found that for half and quarter @xmath2 and @xmath3 electron fillings the intraband coulomb interaction @xmath0 stabilized the axial striped or regular @xmath4-molecular phases for small and intermediate values of @xmath0 and the phase separated @xmath2-electron distributions for @xmath0 large .",
    "the superconducting vertex correlation functions were strongly enhanced within the axial striped and phase separated states , while they were small within the regular @xmath4-molecular phases .",
    "along the lines @xmath70 and @xmath71 only the axial striped or @xmath4-molecular charge phase were identified .",
    "for @xmath75 the @xmath3-wave correlations were enhanced for axial striped phases ( with @xmath101 ) and suppressed for the periodic @xmath86 phase . unlike this case , for @xmath76",
    "the @xmath3-wave vertex correlations were enhanced for all examined @xmath2-electron fillings and the most significantly for @xmath102 .",
    "moreover , it was found that the superconducting correlations in the axial striped phases were strongly influenced by spin arrangements within lines .",
    "in particular , the antiferromagnetic spin arrangement ( found for @xmath76 ) further enhances the d - wave paring correlations , while the ferromagnetic spin arrangement ( found for @xmath75 ) has the opposite effect .",
