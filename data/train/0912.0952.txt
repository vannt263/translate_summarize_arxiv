    "exclusive @xmath6  hadronic cross sections to final states with charm meson pairs are of special interest since they provide information on the spectrum of @xmath7 charmonium states above the open - charm threshold . parameters of these states obtained from fits to the inclusive cross section  @xcite are poorly understood theoretically  @xcite .",
    "initial - state radiation ( isr ) is proved to be a powerful tool for measurement of the @xmath6  exclusive hadronic cross sections at @xmath8  smaller than the initial @xmath6  center - of - mass energy ( @xmath9 ) at @xmath10-factories .",
