    "during galaxy mergers , following a regime of slow approach due to dynamical friction , eventually the central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) approach each other to a separation of the order of @xmath7 schwarzschild radii , when gravitational radiation takes over as the leading order dissipative effect .",
    "the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa , see @xcite ) is expected to detect merging binary smbhs with masses @xmath8solar masses ( m@xmath9 ) up to redshift @xmath10 .",
    "a post - newtonian approach is well suited to describe their forthcoming _",
    "inspiral _ , a regime we define in terms of the post - newtonian ( pn ) parameter @xmath11 @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 characterize  the orbital separation ( from the center of mass ) and speed of the reduced mass particle , @xmath15 is the gravitational constant and @xmath16 the speed of light .",
    "various corrections to the conservative dynamics add up to 2 pn , while the gravitational radiation results in dissipation of energy , angular momentum and orbital angular momentum at 2.5 pn .",
    "the leading order conservative correction to the newtonian dynamics in a compact binary , which results in a change of the orbital plane ( defined by the direction @xmath17 of the newtonian orbital angular momentum @xmath18 of the reduced mass particle @xmath19 ) is the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction @xcite , acst . the precessional time - scale ( the time during which the normal to the orbit @xmath17 undergoes a full rotation ) is longer than the orbital period , however shorter than the characteristic time - scale of gravitational radiation ( defined as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the magnitude of the total orbital angular momentum ) . combined with the leading order gravitational radiation backreaction averaged over one quasicircular orbit ,",

    "x - shaped radio galaxies ( xrgs ) exhibit two pairs of radio lobes and jets @xcite , @xcite . a recent review @xcite summarizes the four different models explaining xrgs : galaxy harbouring twin agns , back - flow diversion models , rapid jet reorientation models , finally a new jet - shell interaction model . a large subset of the observations ( excepting cases , when the jets are aligned with the optical axes of the host ellipticals @xcite ) are well - explained by the jet reorientation model , which in turn implies a spin - flip @xcite , xspinflip of the dominant black hole .",
    "the details of how this would occur were worked out in ref .",
    "a key element was the determination of the typical mass ratio at smbh mergers by a series of estimates , which resulted in mass ratios @xmath22  to @xmath23 . because the spin scales with the mass squared , the second spin was neglected and only the dominant spin @xmath24 ( with magnitude @xmath25 ) kept .",

    "@xcite , gopakumar recently argued that `` it is unlikely that the spin - flip phenomenon will occur during the binary black hole inspiral phase '' @xcite .",
    "this misconception comes from mixing up the _ instantaneous _ change in the direction of the total angular momentum , @xmath36 \\neq 0 $ ] with its _ averaged _ expression @xmath37 over the precessional time - scale .",

    "no spin - flip could ever occur by the combined mechanism of so precession and gravitational radiation . ]    in the present paper we revisit some of the arguments of the spin - flip mechanism and also provide more details on it as compared to ref spinflip . in section 2",
    "we revisit the typical mass ratio argument , following a recent statistics of supermassive black hole candidates , resulting a newly established mass distribution .",
    "we comment on how these findings would affect the typical mass ratio range at smbh encounters . in section 3",
    "we analyze how the spin - flip angle depends on the mass ratio and relative orientation of the spin and orbital angular momentum .",
    "we also derive a formula for the final spin during the inspiral .",
    "finally we present our concluding remarks .",
    "first we summarize the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite on the mass ratios at smbh encounters .",
    "the mass distribution @xmath38 of the galactic central smbhs in the mass range @xmath39 m@xmath9 is well described by a power - law with an exponential cutoff , but for our purposes can be adequately approximated by a broken power - law @xcite-@xcite ( confirmed by an observational survey @xcite ) .",
    "the break is at about @xmath40m@xmath9 . in agreement with these arguments and observations",
    "we assume @xmath41 , with @xmath42 below , and @xmath43 , with @xmath44  above the break .",
    "then the probability for a specific mass ratio arose as an integral over the black hole mass distribution , folded with the rate @xmath45 to merge , and by adopting the lower values of the exponents . for the merger rate we assumed that it scales with the capture cross section @xmath46 ( the dependence on the relative velocity of the two galaxies was neglected , as the universe is not old enough for mass segregation ) . for the capture cross - section we assumed @xmath47 , motivated by the following arguments :    * for galaxies an increase with a factor of @xmath48 in radius ( @xmath49 in cross - section ) accounts for an increase with a factor of @xmath50 in mass ( from the comparison of our galaxy with dwarf spheroidals @xcite-@xcite , *",
    "there is a well established correlation between the smbh mass and the mass of the host bulge @xcite , * the mass of the central smbh scales with both the spheroidal galaxy mass component and the total , dark matter dominated mass of a galaxy benson .    as a result of these considerations",
    "we have found that most likely the mass ratio is in the range @xmath51 .",
    "a typical value to consider would be @xmath52 , thus one of the smbhs being @xmath48 times as massive as the other .",
    "new work on the statistical analysis of 5,895 ned candidate sources carametebiermann has been carried out in the mass range from @xmath53 to above @xmath54 .",
    "below about @xmath55 all candidates are probably compact star clusters , however the rest are likely smbhs .",
    "this work shows that the smbh mass function is a broken power law with @xmath56 at low masses , and @xmath57 at high masses , with a break near @xmath58 ; this general behaviour has been long known , and has now been rederived with a very large sample .",
    "the key difference with respect to previous work was the careful attention paid in order to have equal probability for detecting a smbh in a galaxy , regardless to the hubble type .",
    "the mass distribution of the smbhs is represented on fig [ fig1 ] .",
    "this particular distribution can be interpreted in the context of the merger model silktakahashi with a merger rate scaling as @xmath59 , very much stronger than what we favored in ref @xcite .",
    "the extreme mass dependence describes well a @xmath60 black hole mass distribution consistent with the high end of the mass distribution ; on the other hand a mass dependence of the merger rate close to @xmath61 , suggested by gravitational focusing arguments @xcite describes well the lower mass distribution nearer to @xmath56 .",
    "it remains to be seen , whether all details of the mass function can be understood using either of these mass ratio dependences .",
    "of course these simple merger rate calculations assume an environment without cosmological expansion .",
    "however , for the densest part of the cosmos the local expansion is very weak cavaliere , and that is where most of the mergers occur .",
    "however , for the determination of the typical mass ratio the essential result is only slightly changed .",
    "a merger rate running with mass@xmath62 analytically gives a @xmath60 mass function ( see @xcite ) , as observed ; we use this rate to estimate here the typical mass ratios for high bh masses . redoing the integrals of section 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite with @xmath63 , @xmath64 ( denoted there @xmath65 ) and @xmath66 ( as in silktakahashi , so much more extreme than what was assumed in spinflip ) , then all four integrals are still dominated by the lower bound ; only the second of the integrals has @xmath67 in its lower bound , and so the four integrals have the @xmath68-dependencies of @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and again @xmath72 .",
    "we can ignore the second integral , since it all refers to lower masses merging with lower masses .",
    "the most important integrals are those combining a smbh above the break with a smbh either below or above the break . then the distribution in @xmath68",
    "is found as @xmath72 , a logarithmically even distribution in @xmath73 over a range of @xmath68 from @xmath74 to @xmath75 , so a logarithmic average of @xmath76 .",
    "weighting the two parts of the distribution , the larger mass ratios are favored , which would skew the logarithmic average of the mass ratio to @xmath77 , thus @xmath78 .",
    "the logarithmically even distribution means that the mass ratio ranges @xmath0 from @xmath74 to @xmath79 , from @xmath80 to @xmath81 , from @xmath81 to @xmath82 , from @xmath82 to @xmath83 , from @xmath84 to @xmath85 and finally from @xmath86 to @xmath87 are roughly equal likely . a glance at table 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite shows , that concerning the behaviour of the ratio of the dominant spin and orbital angular momentum magnitudes , we have three regimes :    \\(1 ) @xmath6 when @xmath88throughout the inspiral ,    \\(2 ) @xmath89 when the initial @xmath88is reversed to @xmath90 during the inspiral and    \\(3 ) @xmath0 @xmath91 when @xmath92holds throughout the inspiral .",
    "for the mass ratio ranges ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) no spin - flip can occur during the inspiral , while for ( 2 ) it should . for ( 1 )",
    "there is chance for a spin - flip to occur during the plunge , as some numerical simulations have already found this for equal masses @xcite . for ( 3 )",
    "by contrast there is no possibility for a spin - flip by the combined mechanism of so precession and gravitational radiation .",
    "these mass ratio ranges then occur with ( 1 ) @xmath5 , ( 2 ) @xmath3  and ( 3 ) again @xmath2 probability .",
    "this means that _ the spin - flip still typically occurs during the inspiral_.    m@xmath9 , @xmath93m@xmath9 , @xmath94m@xmath9 , @xmath40m@xmath9 , @xmath95m@xmath9 , respectively . with the exception of the less numerous first range ( orange ) , representing compact star clusters ,",
    "the rest are smbhs.,width=566 ]",
    "in this section we will present an analysis of the spin - flip angle occurring during the inspiral phase in the mass ratio range @xmath1 as a function of the mass ratio .",
    "the spin - flip model be understood as follows .",
    "initially the galactic smbh has conserved spin , along which the primary jet can form .",
    "when the two galaxies collide , the so induced spin precession starts , while gravitational radiation is diminishing the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the direction of the total angular momentum stays unchanged .",
    "the constancy of @xmath96 over the precessional time - scale is due to the fact , that the change in the total angular momentum @xmath97 is about the orbital angular momentum , which ( disregarding gravitational radiation ) undergoes a precessional motion about @xmath98 this shows that the averaged change in @xmath28 is along @xmath28 ( simple precession , @xcite ) .",
    "this conclusion , however , depends strongly on whether the precessional angular frequency @xmath99 is larger than @xmath100 and @xmath101 . indeed ,",
    "if these are comparable , the component perpendicular to @xmath28 in the change @xmath102 will not average out during one precessional cycle , as due to the increase of @xmath27 it can significantly differ at the beginning and at the end of the same precessional cycle .",
    "such a situation would occur , when the spin and the orbital angular momentum are of comparable magnitude ( @xmath103 , a regime through which a binary with typical mass ratio will pass through during the inspiral ) and also roughly antialigned , a low probability regime known as transitional precession . during simple precession eqs .",
    "( [ alphadot])-([betadot ] ) governing the evolution of the angles @xmath27 and @xmath30 also hold in an average sense over the precessional time - scale . in",
    "what follows , we assume simple precession .",
    "the magnitude of the spin is unaffected by gravitational radiation , therefore by the simple rule of addition of vectors the spin has to align close to the @xmath96 direction .",
    "the second jet then can start to form . in the intermediate phase when the spin precesses , instead of jet formation the precessing magnetic field creates a wind , sweeping away the base of the old jet , which in many cases can be observed .",
    "the key equation to start with is eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) . in order to see the validity of this equation , also to _ generalize _ it to the cases of _ non - extreme rotation _ , we need to evaluate    @xmath104    here @xmath105 is some characteristic rotational velocity , @xmath106 the radius of the smbh ( of the order of its schwarzschild radius ) and @xmath107 is the dimensionless ( @xmath108  for extreme rotation ) . therefore @xmath109next we express @xmath110 first from @xmath111 by rewriting @xmath112 , and secondly from the equality of the projections perpendicular to @xmath113 of the total and spin angular momenta @xmath114 , so that we can equal them . by also employing eq .",
    "( [ s1l ] ) and basic trigonometry we obtain    @xmath115    this is the desired generalization of eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "it is worth to note that when applied to the final configuration @xmath116 , eq .",
    "( [ alphachi1 ] ) also stands as a formula for the _ final spin at the end of the inspiral _ , giving the polar angle of the final spin @xmath117 with respect to the axis @xmath96 in terms of the mass ratio , spin magnitude and angle span with the orbital angular momentum .",
    "related formulae based on numerical runs were advanced in refs .",
    "these results are not immediate to compare with ours , as eq .",
    "( [ alphachi1 ] ) could at most be applied at the end of the inspiral ; although in the mass ratio range where it is valid , one would intuitively expect that as not much orbital angular momentum is left at the end of the inspiral in comparison with the dominant spin , the direction of the latter will not be significantly changed during the plunge .",
    "there are three particular configurations worth to mention :    \\i ) the spin is aligned with the orbital angular momentum : @xmath118 , thus from eq .",
    "( [ alphachi1 ] ) @xmath119 and there is no room for any spin - flip .",
    "this would be the situation for perfectly wet mergers , which align the spin with the orbital angular momentum .",
    "\\ii ) the spin is anti - aligned with the orbital angular momentum , @xmath120 . therefore depending",
    "on which of the @xmath25 and @xmath21 are larger , the angle @xmath27 is either @xmath121 or @xmath122 .",
    "\\iii ) for the parameter ranges when the denominator vanishes @xmath123 , from eq .",
    "( [ alphachi1 ] ) we obtain @xmath124 , therefore @xmath30 is also determined .      keeping in mind that due to eqs .",
    "( [ alphadot])-([betadot ] ) the angle @xmath125 is a constant during the inspiral ( a parameter ) , and the dimensionless spin @xmath126 behaves similarly , also regarding the mass ratio as a third parameter characterizing the particular merger , the angle @xmath127 in general remains a function of @xmath32 , thus it evolves together with the orbital separation @xmath13 and velocity @xmath14 .",
    "for the mass ratio @xmath52 we have @xmath128 and @xmath129 . as @xmath130 and @xmath131 ( the equalities arising when the spin and orbital angular momentum are perpendicular ) we have @xmath132 and @xmath133 . for extreme rotation ( @xmath108 )",
    "we obtain @xmath134 .    for @xmath23",
    "we obtain @xmath135 and for extreme rotation @xmath136 .",
    "in fact at the beginning of the inspiral this latter condition ( meaning that the orbital angular momentum is roughly the total angular momentum ) holds in the whole mass ratio range @xmath6 . under these conditions eq .",
    "( [ alphachi1 ] ) can be approximated as@xmath137    for @xmath138 we obtain @xmath139 and for extreme rotation @xmath140 .",
    "in fact at the beginning of the inspiral this latter condition ( meaning that the dominant spin is roughly the total angular momentum ) holds in the whole range @xmath141 . under these conditions eq .",

    "thus @xmath148 in the second equality we have used that @xmath149",
    ".    however we have to take into account , that the above is only true in a 2-dimensional picture . in reality the 3-dimensional so precession will complicate the situation , and the above angle emerges only if the number of precessions during the inspiral is an integer multiple of @xmath150 .",
    "if instead is of the type @xmath151 the spin - flip angle will be maximal , to be calculated as@xmath152where @xmath153 if @xmath154 and @xmath155 if @xmath156 .",
    "the difference between @xmath157 and @xmath158 is due to the fact , that the realignment of the spin along @xmath96 is not perfect .",
    "the closer @xmath159 is to @xmath96 , the less their difference ought to be due a more perfect alignement , therefore @xmath160 should go to @xmath121 with decreasing @xmath161    for generic mass ratios @xmath89 , eqs .",
    "( alphachi1 ) , ( [ sigmamin ] ) and ( [ sigmamax ] ) give the range of allowed spin - flip angle for each relative orientation @xmath162 of the spin with respect to the plane of motion and each @xmath126 .",
    "the generic numerical solution for @xmath158 in the case @xmath108is represented on fig [ fig2 ] as function of the relative orientation of the spin and orbital angular momentum @xmath162 and mass ratio @xmath0 . for a given mass ratio the spin - flip angle has a maximum shifted from @xmath163 towards the anti - aligned configurations .",
    "the figure confirms the prediction , that significant spin - flip will occur during the inspiral in the mass ratio range @xmath89 . for mass ratios smaller than @xmath83 the spin",

    "in light of the new data on a large sample of smbh candidates we have established that the mass ratios obey an even logarithmic distribution in @xmath172 . in the mass ratio range @xmath89 of smbh mergers representing @xmath2 of all possible cases , we have investigated the so precession driven conservative and gravitational radiation driven dissipative contributions to the orbital evolution during the inspiral , averaged over the precession time - scale . in this mass range",
    "the ratio of the dominant spin magnitude and orbital angular momentum magnitude @xmath173 changes from _ less than 1 _ to _ larger than 1 _ during the inspiral .",
    "as the direction of the total angular momentum is unchanged on all time - scales larger than the precession time - scale , while the magnitude of the the orbital angular momentum decreases due to gravitational radiation and the magnitude of the spin stays constant , the spin direction has to change .",
    "the spin - flip of the dominant spin therefore occurs during the _",
    "inspiral_. if jet activity is involved , x - shaped radio galaxies arise by this mechanism and a large set of observations on x - shaped radio galaxies could be explained .    in another @xmath3 of the mergers with mass ratios",
    "@xmath174 the spin - flip never occurs by this mechanism , while in the remaining @xmath5 of mergers with mass ratios @xmath175 it may occur during the plunge .",
    "smbh mergers of equal mass to @xmath176 are only half as likely as the mass ratios @xmath82 to @xmath80 , therefore the occurrence of the spin - flip can be considered typical during the inspiral .",
    "we analyzed the magnitude of the spin - flip angle occurring during the inspiral as function of the mass ratio and original relative orientation of the spin and orbital angular momentum and supported by numerical analysis the theoretical prediction ( fig fig2 ) .",
    "we also derived a formula for the _ final spin _ at the end of the inspiral in this mass ratio range .    during the inspiral",
    "the following relations among the relevant time - scales hold : tilt / spin - flip time - scale @xmath177 inspiral time - scale @xmath178 precession time - scale @xmath178 orbital time - scale ( for all mass ratios in the typical range ) .",
    "interestingly enough , the spin - flip time - scale for a typical mass ratio of @xmath81 is only about three years , while the precession time - scale is less then a day @xcite .",
    "thus rapidly rotating relativistic jets coming close to our line of sight could produce significant variability at all wavelengths years before the coalescence .",
    "therefore electromagnetic counterparts / precursors to the strongest gravitational wave emission are also likely to occur .",

    "<S> in the mass ratio range @xmath1 of supermassive black hole mergers representing @xmath2 of all possible cases , the combined effect of spin - orbit precession and gravitational radiation leads to a spin - flip of the dominant spin during the _ inspiral _ phase of the merger . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath4 a spin - flip never occurs , while in the remaining @xmath5 of mergers with mass ratios @xmath6 it may occur during the plunge . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the magnitude of the spin - flip angle occurring during the inspiral as function of the mass ratio and original relative orientation of the spin and orbital angular momentum . </S>",
