    "pulsars , celestial lighthouses in the sky , are excellent natural laboratories for the research of fundamental properties of matter under the circumstances of strong gravity , strong magnetic field , high density , and extremely relativistic condition .",
    "pulsar physics has been a forefront field of both astronomy and physics for more than 40 years since its discovery .",
    "though exciting progresses in this domain have significantly enlarged our knowledge of astronomical environment and physical processes , there still remain outstanding problems  @xcite . nowadays , due to the efforts made by modern observational instruments covering over various wavelength scopes , _",
    "e.g. _ , rosat , bepposax , chandra , xmm - newton , hst , and vlt , people accumulated a sea of pulsar data , and the data are accreting significantly all these days . hence data analysis and statistical synthesis become a vital step to characterize pulsar properties and reveal their inner regularities  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we perform a systematic investigation of the mantissa distributions of pulsars for the first time .",
    "the mantissa @xmath0\\cup [ ~0.1,~1)$ ] is the significant part of a floating - point number @xmath1 , defined as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is an integer . in this paper ,",
    "if not noted explicitly , we always postulate that the numbers are positive for succinct statement .",
    "one might presume that the mantissas of any randomly chosen data set are approximately uniformly distributed , but that is not the case in real world .",
    "instead , as stated by newcomb  @xcite , _ `` the law of probability of the occurrence of numbers is such that all mantissae of their logarithms are equally likely''_. subsequently , it leads to the conclusion that the first significant digit , i.e. , @xmath4 , of mantissa is logarithmically distributed , where the number @xmath5 appears almost seven times more often than that of the number @xmath6 .",
    "the probability of the occurrence of the first digit can be expressed in an analytical formula , called benford s law  @xcite after the name of its second discoverer , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the probability of a number having the first digit @xmath9 .",
    "empirically , the areas of lakes , the lengths of rivers , arabic numbers on the front page of a newspaper  @xcite , physical constants and distributions  @xcite , the stock market indices  @xcite , file sizes in a personal computer  @xcite , survival distributions  @xcite , widths of hadrons  @xcite , even dynamical systems  @xcite , conform to the peculiar law well . nevertheless , there also exist other types of data , e.g. , lottery and telephone numbers , which do not obey the law .",
    "unfortunately , there is no a priori criteria yet to judge which type a data set belongs to . in practice ,",
    "the law is already applicable in distinguishing and ascertaining fraud in taxing and accounting  @xcite , and speeding up calculation and minimizing expected storage space in computer science  @xcite .",
    "since its second discovery in 1938 , many attempts have been tried to explain the underlying reason for benford s law . for theoretical reviews ,",
    "see papers written by raimi  @xcite and hill  @xcite . nowadays",
    ", many breakthrough points have been achieved in this domain , though , there still lacks a universally accepted final answer . in mathematics ,",
    "benford s law is the only digit law that is scale - invariant  @xcite , which means that the law does not depend on any particular choice of units , discovered by pinkham  @xcite .",
    "also benford s law is base - invariant  @xcite , which means that it is independent of the base @xmath10 you use . in the binary system ( @xmath10=2 ) , octal system ( @xmath10=8 ) , or other base system , the data , as well as in the decimal system ( @xmath10=10 ) , all fit the general first digit law , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "theoretically , hill proved that _ `` scale - invariance implies base - invariance '' _",
    "@xcite and _ `` base - invariance implies benford s law '' _",
    "@xcite mathematically in the framework of probability theory .",
    "he also proved that random entries , picked from random distributions , form a sequence whose significant digit distribution approaches to benford s law  @xcite .    intending to uncover some regularities of pulsar data , and also to explore new domains of the digit law",
    ", we investigate the mantissa distributions of pulsar quantities systematically .",
    "we find that the first nonzero digit of mantissas displays unevenness according to the logarithmic law .",
    "the exceptions are the barycentric period and rotation frequency , which show significant deviations from benford s law .",
    "further , we also discuss various properties of the digit law , and perform the generalized benford s law to data sets of barycentric period and rotation frequency of pulsars as well .",
    "therefore the data of pulsars provide an ideal assemblage for further studies on the first digit law of the nature .",
    "we investigate the famous australia telescope national facility ( atnf ) pulsar catalogue , which is a widely used database , maintained by manchester _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "thanks to their exhaustive search of pulsar literatures , at least back to 1993 , data from all papers announcing the discoveries of pulsars or giving improved parameters are entered into the catalogue database . as atnf pulsar catalogue is an updating database , to avoid ambiguity , in this paper we make use of _ catalogue version 1.36 _ , including totally 1826 samples of pulsars .",
    "however , not every pulsar item has complete information , e.g. , one of 1826 pulsars , j1911 + 00 , in this database has no information on barycentric period hence rotation frequency .",

    "apart from the feasibility of the rough assumptions , the expected minimum mass and median mass are neither natural numbers by measurement , and the physics of these companion masses also places constraints on the range of values , making it difficult for their distributions to be logarithmically uniform , thus the departures from the logarithmic distribution with rather large @xmath21 for minmass and medmass are expected .",
