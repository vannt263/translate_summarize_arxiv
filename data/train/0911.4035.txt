    "ferroelectrics which can convert mechanical to electrical energy ( and vice versa ) have wide applications in medical imaging , telecommunication and ultrasonic devices , the physical properties of which are sensitive to external conditions , such as strain , film thickness , temperature , electric and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "@xmath4 ( bto ) and @xmath5 ( pto ) , as prototype ferroelectric materials and simple systems , have been intensively studied @xcite .",
    "it is known that the ferroelectricity arises from the competition of short - range repulsions which favor the paraelectric cubic phase and coulomb forces which favor the ferroelectric phase @xcite . as the pressure increases , the short - range repulsions increase faster than the coulomb forces , leading to the reduced ferroelectricity .",
    "accompanied with the suppression of ferroelectricity , the piezoelectricity decreases and even disappears .",
    "however , recent studies have shown that the noncollinear polarization rotation , occurring at phase transition pressure , can result in the giant piezoelectric response @xcite .",
    "in contrast to previous theoretical studies of the effects of epitaxial strain on the spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric thin films , we have systematically studied the influence of uniaxial and in - plane epitaxial strains on the mechanical and piezoelectric properties of perovskite ferroelectrics @xcite .",
    "so far , there has been no previous work on the effect of uniaxial tensile strains on the mechanical and piezoelectric properties of short - period bto / pto superlattices .",
    "ferroelectric superlattices composed of alternating epitaxial oxides ultrathin layers are currently under intensive study due to their excellent ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties @xcite .",
    "ferroelectricity can be induced in @xmath6 superlattice in spite of the paraelectric nature of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this is because the coincidence of the positive and negative charge centers is destroyed in the superlattice and electric dipoles are induced .",
    "moreover , ferroelectricity can be enhanced in ferroelectric superlattices in certain stacking sequences @xcite .",
    "the overall polarization of three - component @xmath9 ferroelectric superlattices can also be improved by increasing the number of bto and pto layers @xcite .",
    "thanks to the periodic nature , it is possible to study the effect of uniaxial or biaxial strains on the properties of ferroelectric superlattices from first principles .    in this work ,",
    "we perform total energy as well as linear response calculations to study the effect of uniaxial tensile stress along the @xmath1 axis on the mechanical and piezoelectric properties of short - period bto / pto superlattice .",
    "we show the mechanical properties by calculating the ideal tensile strength , elastic constants and valence charge density at different strains .",
    "we also show the influence of uniaxial stress on the piezoelectricity . to reveal the underlying mechanisms , we study the effects of uniaxial tensile stress on the atomic displacements and born effective charges , respectively .",
    "our calculations are performed within the local density approximation ( lda ) to the density functional theory ( dft ) as implemented in the plane - wave pseudopotential abinit package @xcite . to ensure good numerical convergence ,",
    "the plane - wave energy cutoff is set to be 80 ry and the brillouin zone integration is performed with @xmath10 * k*-meshpoints .",
    "the norm - conserving pseudopotentials generated by the opium program are tested against the all - electron full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave method @xcite .",
    "the orbitals of ba @xmath11 , pb @xmath12 , ti @xmath13 , and o @xmath14 are explicitly included as valence electrons . the dynamical matrices and",
    "born effective charges are computed by the linear response theory of strain type perturbations , which has been proved to be highly reliable for ground state properties @xcite .",
    "the polarization is calculated by the berry - phase approach @xcite .",
    "the lda is used instead of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) because the gga is found to overestimate both the equilibrium volume and strain for the perovskite structures @xcite .",
    "the piezoelectric strain coefficients @xmath15=@xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the piezoelectric stress tensor and the elastic compliance tensor @xmath18 is the reciprocal of the elastic stiffness tensor @xmath19 ( roman indexes from 1 to 3 , and greek ones from 1 to 6 ) .    in the calculations ,",
    "a double - perovskite ten - atom supercell along the @xmath1 axis is used for the tetragonal short - period bto / pto superlattice .",
    "the primitive periodicity of tetragonal structure with the space group @xmath20 is retained , which is more stable in energy than the rhombohedral structure .",
    "for the tetragonal perovskite structure compounds bto and pto , the equilibrium lattice parameters are @xmath21(bto)=3.915 @xmath22 , @xmath1(bto)=3.995 @xmath22 , @xmath21(pto)=3.843 @xmath22 , and @xmath1(pto)=4.053 @xmath22 , which are slightly less than the experimental values of 3.994 , 4.034 , 3.904 , and 4.135 @xmath22 , respectively @xcite .",
    "a sketch of ground - state short - period bto / pto superlattice with its atomic positions is shown in fig.1 .        to calculate the uniaxial tensile stress @xmath23",
    ", we apply a small strain increment @xmath24 along the @xmath1 axis and then conduct structural optimization for the lattice vectors perpendicular to the @xmath1 axis and all the internal atomic positions until the two components of stress tensor ( i.e. , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) are smaller than 0.05 gpa . the strain is then increased step by step . since @xmath25=@xmath27 ,",
    "the elastic constants satisfy @xmath24/@xmath28@xmath29-@xmath30/@xmath31 under the loading of uniaxial tensile strain applied along the @xmath1 axis , where the strains @xmath32 are calculated by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with @xmath35=3.897 @xmath22 and @xmath36=7.859 @xmath22 being the lattice constants of the unstrained superlattice structure .",
    "we have examined the accuracy of our calculations by studying the influence of different strains on the properties of bto and pto , respectively @xcite .",
    ", and the inset reflects the relation between strains @xmath24 and @xmath28 .",
    "( b ) elastic constants as a function of stress @xmath23.,width=321 ]    figure 2(a ) shows the uniaxial tensile stress @xmath23 as a function of strain @xmath24 .",
    "the relation between strains @xmath28 and @xmath24 is shown in the inset , which satisfy @xmath37 .",
    "the stress @xmath23 increases until reaching its maximum value of 6.85 gpa with increasing strain , indicating that the calculated ideal tensile strength is 6.85 gpa for the superlattice , which is the maximum stress required to break the superlattice .",
    "figure 2(b ) shows the elastic constants as a function of stress @xmath23 , which reflect the relation between stress and strain .",
    "what is the most unexpected is that the constant @xmath38 first decreases until reaching its minimum value at @xmath39=3.26 gpa and then gradually increases , promising a large electromechanical response at @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the minimum @xmath38 corresponds to the minimum slope of the curve of fig.2(a ) at @xmath39 .",
    "other elastic constants , especially @xmath40 , always decrease with increasing @xmath23 , indicating that the superlattice under the loading of uniaxial tensile stress along the @xmath1 axis becomes soft along the nonpolar axes .",

    "the pb-@xmath43 , ba-@xmath44 , @xmath45-@xmath44 and @xmath46-@xmath43 bond lengths are not sensitive to the uniaxial tensile stress along the @xmath1 axis , suggesting that the orbital hybridizations between these atoms are not sensitive to the uniaxial strain , whereas the @xmath45-@xmath47 and @xmath46-@xmath48 bonds elongate remarkably with increasing stress . following the evolution of the charge density , we find that the weak @xmath45-@xmath47 bond starts to break first , followed by the @xmath46-@xmath48 bond . after the bond breaks , the system converts into a planar structure with alternating layers .",
    "on the other hand , figures 3(a ) and 3(b ) show that the valence charge density becomes more and more unsymmetrical with the uniaxial tensile stress increasing , indicating the increase in polarization . to confirm this ,",
    "we have directly calculated the relations between the polarization and the uniaxial tensile stress with the berry - phase approach .     and @xmath2).,width=321 ]    figure 4(a ) shows the polarization as a function of uniaxial tensile stress . for the ground - state superlattice , the calculated spontaneous polarization of 0.29 @xmath49 is less than the theoretical value of 0.81 @xmath49 of ground - state pto , but slightly larger than the value of 0.28 @xmath49 of tetragonal bto ( the other theoretical value is 0.26 @xmath49 @xcite ) , which supports the conclusion that the sharp interfaces suppress the polarization in short - period bto / pto superlattices @xcite .",
    "as the stress @xmath23 increases , the polarization dramatically increases with the maximum slope appearing at @xmath39 , indicating that the ferroelectric phase becomes more and more stable with respect to the paraelectric phase .",
    "figure 4(b ) shows the variation of piezoelectric coefficients with stress @xmath23 , which are calculated by the linear response theory .",
    "the piezoelectric coefficients all increase with increasing @xmath23 and reach their maximum values at @xmath39 , indicating that the appropriately applied uniaxial tensile stress can enhance the piezoelectricity for the superlattice .",
    "the piezoelectric coefficient @xmath2 of ground - state superlattice is 86.36 @xmath3 , which is slightly less than the value of 103.18 @xmath3 of pto , but much larger than the value of 36.43 @xmath3 of bto . under the loading of uniaxial tensile stress applied along the @xmath1 axis",
    ", @xmath2 is increased from its ground state value by a factor of about 8 , reaching 678.42 @xmath3 for the superlattice . from previous calculations @xcite , we know that the uniaxial tensile stress can only enhance @xmath2 of pto to the maximum value of 380.50 @xmath3 .",
    "the enhancement of piezoelectricity is supported by the conclusion of uniaxial tensile stress dependency of elastic constant @xmath38 [ see fig.2(b ) ] .",
    "note that the polarization under uniaxial stress remains along the @xmath50 direction and that the piezoelectric coefficients reflect the slope of polarization versus stress curves .",
    "the enhancement of piezoelectricity corresponds to the maximum slope of the curve of fig.4(a ) at @xmath39 , it is the change of magnitude of polarization that leads to the enhancement of piezoelectricity .     and ( b ) atomic displacements along the @xmath1 axis ( in @xmath1 units ) , relative to the centrosymmetric reference structure , as a function of uniaxial tensile stress.,width=321 ]    to reveal the underlying mechanisms for the abnormal piezoelectricity , we study the effects of uniaxial tensile stress on the born effective charges and atomic displacements , respectively [ see figs.5(a ) and 5(b ) ] . since the atomic displacements and polarization are all along the @xmath1 axis , only charges @xmath51 contribute to the polarization .",
    "the uniaxial tensile stress reduces the effective charges , which remain almost constant when @xmath52 .",
    "the charges @xmath51 of @xmath44 and @xmath43 atoms are much close to their normal charges , so does the case of ti atoms when @xmath52 , whereas @xmath51 of @xmath47 and @xmath48 atoms are anomalously large compared with their normal charges , suggesting the strong orbital hybridization between @xmath45 ( and @xmath46 ) 3@xmath53 and @xmath48 ( and @xmath47 ) 2@xmath54 states [ see fig.3(b ) ] .",
    "note that the ba atom is fixed at ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) during the first - principles simulations .",
    "the displacements of o atoms , which are much larger than those of pb and ti atoms for a broad range of stress , are greatly enhanced as the stress @xmath23 increases , especially near @xmath39 , leading to the drastic increase in polarization .",
    "it is concluded that as the stress @xmath23 increases , the atomic displacements are so greatly enhanced that the overall effect is the increase in polarization , even though the magnitudes of @xmath51 decrease with the stress increasing .",
    "in summary , we have studied the influence of uniaxial tensile stress applied along the @xmath1 axis on the mechanical and piezoelectric properties of short - period bto / pto superlattice using first - principles methods .",
    "we show that the calculated ideal tensile strength is 6.850 gpa and that the superlattice under the loading of uniaxial tensile stress becomes soft along the nonpolar axes .",
    "we also find that the appropriately applied uniaxial tensile stress can significantly enhance the piezoelectricity for the superlattice .",
    "our calculated results reveal that it is the drastic increase of atomic displacements along the @xmath1 axis that leads to the increase in polarization and that the enhancement of piezoelectricity is attributed to the change in the magnitude of polarization with the stress .",
    "our work suggests a way of enhancing the piezoelectric properties of the superlattices , which would be helpful to enhance the performance of the piezoelectric devices .",
