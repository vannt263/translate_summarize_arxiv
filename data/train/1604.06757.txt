    "elements heavier than iron are produced via two principle processes , namely , the slow neutron capture process ( s - process ) and the rapid neutron capture process ( r - process ) , differing in the respective neutron capture timescales with respect to the @xmath2-decay half - lives .",
    "there is a minor contribution from another process , namely , p - process , producing a subset of proton - rich isotopes .",
    "the detailed study of the heavy element nucleosynthesis was done in the fundamental work of burbidge @xcite and also of cameron @xcite .",
    "recently kppeler @xcite presented a review of progress on the studies of s - process nucleosynthesis with advanced nuclear physics inputs , observational data , and stellar models .",
    "while the majority of the theory of the s - process is well - developed , uncertainty still remains in constraining the neutron capture rates of nuclei involved in nucleosynthesis chain .",
    "the capture cross sections are highly scattered and uncertain in the energy range appropriate for astrophysical applications . these uncertainties lead to significant errors in determining exact abundances of elements involved in different processes .",
    "many works have been devoted to this respect in order to measure the thermal neutron capture cross sections relevant to s - process temperature .",
    "however , reactions on some important nuclei are still not available due to their unavailability in the terrestrial laboratory .",
    "kppeler @xcite showed the present status of the uncertainty of stellar @xmath3 cross sections and commented that improvements are certainly necessary especially in the mass region below a=120 and above a=180 .",
    "some reactions are of significant importance , basically those with closed neutron shells acting as bottlenecks to the s - process reaction flow .",
    "they have very low cross - sections and in some scenarios , the s - process reaction flow can not overcome these bottlenecks .",
    "the neutron capture cross sections of the branch - point nuclei in the s - process path also have to be known with better accuracy .",
    "the branching in the s - process path appears when a competition between neutron capture and @xmath2-decay takes place due to the appearance of a long - lived nucleus with a larger probability of neutron capture than @xmath2-decay .",
    "further propagation depends on the neutron density and temperature and hence branching analysis can be used as an efficient monitor of stellar neutron density and temperature .",
    "these branchings also have an overall influence in changing the nucleosynthesis path of s - process and hence on the final yields of the nuclei produced .",
    "thus , more accurate cross sections are nowadays also needed to resolve the discrepancies in overproduction problems of some elements .",
    "the s - process is subdivided into weak , main , and strong components .",
    "recently , another component , called lighter element primary process ( lepp ) is also proposed .",
    "the neutron exposure for weak s - process is too low to achieve flow equilibrium and hence a small uncertainty in capture cross section may lead to significant changes in abundance for a number of heavier elements .",
    "this so - called propagation problem requires new data for the weak component in between fe to sr .",
    "our present study deals with nuclei near @xmath0 shell closure where mainly the weak s - process component creates elements between fe to sr - y - zr region . in a previous work",
    ", we studied the thermal @xmath3 cross sections near @xmath4 shell closure in between isotopes of xenon to samarium @xcite which are produced by the main component of s - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "the astrophysical origins of the weak and main components are completely different .",
    "the weak component occurs during the convective he core and c - shell burning in massive stars driving the material with masses 56 @xmath5 a @xmath5 90 , in contrast to the main component , occurring mostly in asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "however , there remains some confusion about the marginal border between these two components and most of the nuclei considered in the present study reside in the vicinity of this border region .",
    "they are considered to be produced in both main and weak components of stellar s - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "for example ,",
    "50% of the solar abundances of the s - only pair @xmath6sr are formed in the main component and remaining 50% are from the weak component of s - process @xcite . in the concerned mass region , there are six stable nuclei on the nucleosynthesis path with magic neutron number @xmath0 , namely , @xmath7kr , @xmath8rb , @xmath9sr , @xmath10y , and @xmath11zr , and @xmath12mo .",
    "the present study also involves some nuclei produced in astrophysical p - process near @xmath0 closed shell ( @xmath13sr , @xmath14mo , @xmath15ru ) .",
    "the p - nuclei , those are 10 to 100 times less abundant than s- or r - nuclei in the same mass range are produced in the high - temperature environment via the sequences of photo - disintegration and @xmath16 decays driving the path through the extreme proton - rich side .",
    "however , current theoretical models are incapable of reproducing the p - nuclei abundances in good agreements ( except in certain mass range ) with observation and this inadequacy is directly related to the absence of proper nuclear inputs with reduced uncertainties .",
    "thus , @xmath3 reactions have significant impact in p - process abundance determination as they hinder the flux via competing with @xmath17 reactions .",
    "some studies @xcite have revealed a high degree of sensitivity towards the @xmath3 rate variations in p - process during the network calculations .",
    "for example , rayet found that the suppression of @xmath3 channel leads to change the p - nuclei overproduction factors , in some cases by order as large as 10 or 100 @xcite .",
    "hence , accurate determination of cross sections is highly needed for them .",
    "particularly the @xmath3 cross sections on p - nuclei are difficult to measure as they are not found in significant amounts for time - of - flight ( tof ) or activation measurements .",
    "experimental data are very scarce in this respect and by far most of the rates are to be inferred from statistical model calculations .    in the domain of @xmath0 shell proximity ,",
    "some nuclei exist which are predominantly produced via s - process only .",
    "these so called s - only isotopes ( @xmath7sr , @xmath9sr , and @xmath18mo ) are of special importance as they can provide necessary clues to the s - process branchings .",
    "hence , accuracy is also required in the cross sections of these s - only isotopes .",
    "some other important aspects , for which more accurate and enhanced nuclear data are required , are those of unstable elements having isotopic anomalies .",
    "for example , in the region of @xmath0 shell closure , kr and zr isotopes show anomalies in meteoritic isotopic distribution .",
    "there remain discrepancies in between measured and model - based isotopic ratios and a spread in the ratio with grain size of the material is a persistent problem.the isotopes @xmath19zr and @xmath20tc are of particular interest as they are being used in the nuclear transmutation of long - lived fission products ( llfp ) . the capture cross sections of the stable zirconium isotopes as well as @xmath19zr are very important for the transmutation study on @xmath19zr .",
    "similar to @xmath19zr , the isotope @xmath20tc with half - life of 2.11@xmath2110@xmath22 years and a large cumulative yield in the thermal neutron fission of @xmath23u , is also one of the most important llfps for transmutation technology to convert the radioactive wastes into stable or short - lived nuclei .",
    "the unstable isotopes are not available for direct measurement .",
    "even the experimental data on stable isotopes are inadequate and hence , theoretical estimates are strongly required for them .",
    "it is also possible to predict the values of stellar mean neutron exposure relevant to s - process from the measurement of @xmath3 cross sections .",
    "for example , bauer @xcite recommended a set of neutron density , temperature , and mean neutron exposure from the cross section measurements , both for main and weak components .",
    "there are a few other works which investigated the same quantities from radiative cross sections @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 cross sections can also be used in the study of nuclear cosmochronology to determine the age of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "though the neutron capture cross sections , in general , have @xmath24 dependence , this can significantly differ when the p - wave capture is superimposed on pure s - wave contribution , thus resulting in an increase in the cross - section values with incident neutron energy .    in the reaction path ,",
    "neutron capture reactions on some nuclei populate both ground and isomeric states of the residual nuclei .",
    "thus , it is also possible to measure the isomeric ratios of those elements if both total cross section and partial capture cross sections to isomeric states are known .",
    "moreover , certain branchings in the reaction path depend on the probability of populating the isomeric states @xcite",
    ". the population of long - lived isomeric states can be important in branching analysis if they do not achieve thermal equilibrium in the stellar environment of s - process @xcite .",
    "one such branch point in this region exists at @xmath25kr .",
    "besides the strong branch point at @xmath25kr , there exist some weaker branch points .",
    "weak branchings can be analyzed only if accurate macs values are known .",
    "measurement of neutron capture reactions requires an energy resolution comparable to the distance between the overlapping levels of compound nucleus in which the captures occur .",
    "recently much progress has been made in the neutron induced cross - section measurement .",
    "bao @xcite have recommended a large set of macs values for @xmath3 reactions relevant to s - process .",
    "we have also compared our macs results with the theoretical most calculations .",
    "most is a hauser - feshbach code @xcite which derives all nuclear inputs from global microscopic models @xcite .",
    "there are various experimental techniques for measuring @xmath3 cross sections , each suffering from its own inherent deficiency .",
    "the most widely used methods are the time - of - flight ( tof ) and activation techniques .",
    "tof is particularly suitable for measuring @xmath3 cross sections over a broad energy range which in turn is required in obtaining macs values .",
    "however , more accurate measurements are in demand for various reasons . some recent techniques , such as pulse height weighing technique ( phwt ) , n_tof and 4@xmath26 ray detectors can give results with sufficiently reduced background and neutron sensitivity .",
    "still experiments are far away from producing precise measurements over the entire mass range .",
    "for example , reactions having pronounced contribution from direct capture processes are hard to be measured via tof detectors .",
    "dc mechanism is important mainly near magic neutron numbers .",
    "for example , capture on @xmath9sr possesses significant dc contribution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we have discussed theoretical background of our calculation .",
    "next , in section iii , we have discussed the results obtained from our theoretical approach .",
    "first , the @xmath3 cross sections for nuclei near @xmath0 closed shell , those take part in the nucleosynthesis chain , are calculated with our theoretical approach and plotted with available experimental data .",
    "the macs values , at a single thermal energy of 30 kev , are tabulated with experimental values and most2005 predictions .",
    "further , macs values for the energy range from 5 to 100 kev are also presented for neutron magic nuclei .",
    "lastly , the summary is given followed by acknowledgment and bibliography .",
    "relativistic - mean - field model is highly successful in describing binding energies , charge radii , different ground and excited state properties of nuclei , deformation , etc .",
    "we have chosen fsu gold parameterization @xcite for lagrangian density @xcite .",
    "we have obtained binding energies and charge radii in spherical rmf approach and compare with available experimental data .",
    "the difference between binding energies from theoretical rmf approach and experimental data @xmath27 is attributed to the strength of n - p interaction of nucleus and also to some extent to the odd - even mass difference and a correction is done in this respect .",
    "this is taken care of by the casten factor p @xcite defined as , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the number of valence particles ( or holes past mid - shell ) and the difference is given by ap , where a=-2.07 mev @xcite .",
    "more information can be available in ref .",
    "this correction has been carried out in the present work .",
    "the point proton density ( @xmath31 ) , obtained from relativistic - mean - field theory is folded with standard gaussian form factor f(*r * ) to obtain the charge density ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "_ ch(*r*)=_p(*r*)f(*r*-*r * ) d*r * f(r)=(a ) ^-3exp(-r^2/a^2 ) where , the constant @xmath33 with @xmath34=0.8 fm , being the r.m.s radius of proton .",
    "the integration is done in coordinate space .",
    "the charge - density distribution thus obtained are compared with densities obtained from fourier - bessel ( fb ) parameter fit .",
    "fb parameters are derived from the experimental elastic electron scattering data @xcite .",
    "the charge densities are then determined using the following relation .",
    "@xmath35 here @xmath36 denotes the fb coefficients and @xmath37 denotes the bessel function of order zero .",
    "theoretical calculation of reaction cross section requires the construction of an optical - model potential which can efficiently describe the absorption ( via the imaginary part ) as well as scattering ( via the real part ) . in early days , a phenomenological energy and mass independent mean potential of square - well woods - saxon form was used mostly for astrophysical calculation in local or global form . however , there are many limitations with this prescription and recently there is considerable development in microscopic approach .",
    "we have constructed a microscopic optical - model potential by folding ddm3y pure nucleon - nucleon interaction with the radial matter density of target to give a direct shape and strength of the nuclear potential .",
    "the baryon density has been extracted from relativistic - mean - field approach .",
    "ddm3y interaction has been used in various works @xcite over a wide energy range from few kev to several mev .",
    "we have applied this optical - model potential in several of our previous works @xcite .",
    "it is found that this semi - microscopic potential is well - capable of describing proton capture ( @xmath38 ) reaction rates over a wide mass region when real and imaginary potential well depths are being normalized with available experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "the detailed description of the nn interaction and potential formation is given in dutta @xcite , where we have employed this theory to calculate the @xmath3 cross sections for nuclei near @xmath4 neutron shell closure .",
    "in the present work , we calculate the @xmath3 reaction cross sections near @xmath0 closed neutron shell .",
    "[ s - path ]    the radiative thermal @xmath3 cross sections are calculated using statistical model code talys1.8 @xcite applying ddm3y nucleon - nucleon interaction folded with radial matter densities of target nuclei obtained from rmf theory .",
    "calculation of @xmath3 reaction cross sections relevant to s - process in statistical hauser - feshbach approach depends on the choice of various crucial input parameters .",
    "the basic ingredient is transmission coefficients for both formation and decay channels of compound nucleus .",
    "these coefficients require exact knowledge of nuclear spin , energy , and parity .",
    "one of the basic inputs is nuclear level density .",
    "nowadays , it is believed that the largest uncertainty in reaction cross - section prediction in statistical hauser - feshbach approach comes from the inappropriate description of nuclear level density @xcite .",
    "hauser - feshbach formalism assumes a large number of resonances at compound formation energy so that the width of individual one can be averaged over the resonances .",
    "this , in turn , requires a high level density in the compound nuclear state in the specified energy window .",
    "we have chosen the level density from goriely s microscopic calculation @xcite in the combinatorial method that takes into account both rotational enhancement factor as well as vibrational phonon excitations .",
    "it is also incorporated with appropriate renormalization factors those can efficiently reproduce the s- and p - wave neutron resonance spacings .",
    "thus , it has a further advantage that the data can be extrapolated at sufficiently low energies relevant to neutron capture process .",
    "targets with closed shell , in general , have widely spaced nuclear levels .",
    "furthermore , depending upon the level density in the system , different reaction mechanisms dominate , as different radial parts of the target are probed .",
    "the reactions near shell closure are characterized by small q - values .",
    "hence , here the cross sections are basically dominated by isolated or narrow resonances . in extreme cases , the direct component can also be important and interference terms may also contribute .",
    "another important aspect is given to @xmath39-ray strength function .",
    "for radiative capture reactions , the dominant transition , that appears in photon transmission coefficient , is of e1-type .",
    "this is given by , t_e1=2f_e1(e_)e_^3 where , @xmath40 is the e1 @xmath39-ray strength function dependent on @xmath39-ray energy e@xmath41 and also on the strength , energy and width of the giant dipole resonances .",
    "it is taken from the microscopic hartree - fock - bogolyubov calculations @xcite for the present work .    in any reaction mechanism ,",
    "different channels get activated depending upon the energy of the system .",
    "these channels have their own partial widths and hence the transmission coefficients must be renormalized by suitable multiplication factors .",
    "this is taken care of by the width fluctuation correction .",
    "the correction includes certain correlation factors that couple all partial channels altogether .",
    "it is thus predominantly important near the threshold of new channel openings where channel strengths differ by large factors . in the present study ,",
    "this correction has been carried out . pairing energy correction for pre - equilibrium reactions",
    "is also included .",
    "the number of discrete levels for decay via a cascade of @xmath39 rays is taken to be 30 in number , for both target and residual nuclei .",
    "full @xmath42 coupling is utilized in hf calculation .",
    "radial densities are taken from rmf model .      in the study of neutron",
    "induced reactions in astrophysics , one is interested in low energy regime , from few kev to several mev .",
    "the @xmath3 reactions relevant to s - process basically occurs at thermal energies . unlike charged particles ,",
    "gamow peak can not be defined in this case , as there is no penetration through coulomb barrier .",
    "hence , for neutron induced reactions , location of energy window depends on the contribution from partial waves , ( i.e. , on the angular momentum quantum number @xmath43 ) .",
    "cross sections , in general , can be parameterized as a function of energy in terms of dominant partial waves . on this basis ,",
    "a simple approximation is done for energy peak ( @xmath44 ) and width ( @xmath45 ) of neutron induced reactions , as follows @xcite .",
    "@xmath46 @xmath47 where , @xmath48 is the temperature in @xmath49 .",
    "obviously for s - wave @xmath50 neutrons , energy window is simply given by the peak and width of maxwell- boltzmann distribution .",
    "for higher partial waves , obviously the peak and width get slightly shifted to higher energies due to penetration effect of centrifugal barrier .",
    "considering the typical temperature of stellar s - process sites , we have calculated @xmath3 cross sections within the energy range between 1 kev to 1 mev .      as mentioned earlier that in the astrophysical environment of s - process , cross sections of @xmath3 reactions have a spread over a range of thermal energies . in the scenario of s - process nucleosynthesis ,",
    "when a thermal equilibrium is achieved , the neutron spectrum corresponds to a maxwell - boltzmann distribution and maxwellian - averaged cross sections are obtained by folding the total cross section at particular energy with the thermalized neutron spectra over the wide range of neutron energy .",
    "it is defined as , @xmath51 here @xmath52 is the energy in center - of - mass frame .",
    "thus in principle , macs should be close to @xmath53 .",
    "an observation of correlation of macs values with the size of the nucleus will obviously show local minima at closed neutron shells .",
    "the classical s - process models usually used the macs values at a single thermal energy , especially at @xmath54 kev corresponding to temperature @xmath5510@xmath56 k. however , recent stellar models coupled with stellar s - process network codes use macss at different thermal energies .",
    "hence , we have calculated macs values for nuclei having closed neutron shell with @xmath0 for thermal energies ranging from 5 to 100 kev .",

    "the calculations are done in fully statistical hauser - feshbach approach with the standard reaction code talys1.8 .",
    "we have compared the results with the available experimental data .",
    "our theory reproduces most of the measurements with reasonable agreement .",
    "the experimental data in some cases are extremely old and hence suffer from underestimation of proper background and error correction .",
    "also some significant inputs in statistical calculations suffer from the lack of measured data .",
    "for example , experimental signature of giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) for @xmath7kr is not available yet and hence enters into the statistical model calculations from systematics .",
    "thus , unavailability of experimentally measured parameters is a possible reason for the discrepancies between experiments and statistical model predictions .",
