    "the nuclear level density ( nld ) is an important input for the calculation of reaction cross sections in the framework of hauser - feshbach ( hf ) theory of compound nuclear reactions .",
    "compound reaction cross sections are needed in many applications including astrophysics and nuclear data for science and technology . in astrophysics",
    "the knowledge of reaction rates is crucial for understanding nucleosynthesis and energy generation in stars and stellar explosions . in many astrophysical scenarios ,",
    "e.g. the r - process , the cross sections required to compute the reaction rates are in the regime where the statistical approach is appropriate  @xcite . in these cases hf calculations are an essential tool for determining reaction rates , particularly for reactions involving radioactive nuclei which are presently inaccessible to experiment .",
    "hf calculations are likewise very important for other applications , e.g. , the advanced reactor fuel cycle program  @xcite .",
    "the statistical approach utilized in hf theory  @xcite requires knowledge of the two quantities for participating species ( see details below ) .",
    "these are the transmission coefficients of incoming and outgoing particles and level densities of residual nuclei .",
    "transmission coefficients can be obtained from optical model potentials established on the basis of experimental data of elastic and total cross sections .",
    "because of experimental constraints , the difference between various sources of transmission coefficients usually does not exceed @xmath7 .",
    "level densities are more uncertain .",
    "the reason is that it is difficult to obtain them experimentally above the region of well - resolved discrete low - lying levels known from nuclear spectroscopy . at present",
    ", the level density for practical applications is calculated mainly on the basis of the fermi - gas @xcite and gilbert - cameron @xcite formulas with adjustable parameters which are found from experimental data on neutron resonance spacing and the density of low - lying discrete levels .",
    "parameters recommended for use in hf calculations are tabulated in ref .",
    "the global parameter systematics for both the fermi - gas and gilbert - cameron formulas have been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , it is still unclear how well these parameters reproduce compound reaction cross sections .",
    "no systematic investigations have been performed yet .",
    "experimental data on level density above discrete levels are scarce .",
    "some information is available from particle evaporation spectra ( i.e. from compound nuclear reactions ) .",
    "the latest data obtained from ( p , n ) reaction on sn isotopes  @xcite claims that the available level density parameters do not reproduce neutron cross sections thereby indicating the problem with level density parameterizations .",
    "it becomes obvious that more experimental data on level density are needed in the energy region above discrete levels .",
    "in this work , we study compound nuclear reactions to obtain information about level densities of the residual nuclei from particle evaporation spectra .",
    "two different reactions , d+@xmath1co and @xmath2he+@xmath3fe , which produce the same @xmath8ni compound nucleus , have been investigated .",
    "this approach helps to eliminate uncertainties connected to a specific reaction mechanism . as opposed to most of the similar experiments where only one type of outgoing particles has been measured , we have measured cross sections of all main outgoing particles including neutrons , protons , and @xmath0-particles , populating @xmath5ni , @xmath5co , and @xmath6fe , respectively",
    ".    we will begin with a discussion of the present status of level density estimates used as inputs for hf calculations .",
    "the simple level counting method to determine the level density of a nucleus works only up to a certain excitation energy below which levels are well separated and can be determined from nuclear spectroscopy .",
    "this region is typically up to 2  mev for heavy nuclei and up to 6 - 9 mev for light ones . above these energies ,",
    "more sophisticated methods have to be applied .      in the region of neutron resonances which are located just above the neutron binding energy ( @xmath9 ) ,",
    "the level density can again be determined by counting . in this case",
    "neutron resonances are counted ; one must also take into account the assumed spin cut - off factor @xmath10 .",
    "traditionally , because of the the absence of reliable data below b@xmath11 , the level density is determined by an interpolation procedure between densities of low - lying discrete levels and density obtained from neutron resonance spacing.the bethe fermi - gas model  @xcite with adjustable parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 is often used as an interpolation formula : @xmath14}{12\\sqrt{2}\\sigma a^{1/4}(e-\\delta)^{5/4 } } , \\label{eq : rho}\\ ] ] where the @xmath10 is the spin cut - off factor determining the level spin distribution .",
    "there are a few drawbacks to this approach .",
    "one shortcoming is that it uses an assumption that the selected model is valid in the entire excitation energy region including low - lying discrete states and neutron resonances .",
    "undoubtedly this is correct for some of the nuclei .",
    "a nice example is the level density of @xmath15al which exhibits fermi - gas behavior up to 8  mev of excitation energy  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the level densities of @xmath16fe measured with oslo method  @xcite , for example , show complicated behavior which can not be described by simple fermi - gas formula .",
    "the reason for this might be the influence of pairing correlations leading to step structures in vicinity of proton and neutron paring energies and above .",
    "in such cases the model function fit to discrete levels may undergo considerable deviations in the higher excitation energy region leading to incorrect determination of level density parameters .",
    "another consideration is associated with the spin cut - off parameter which is important in determination of the total level density from density of neutron resonances at @xmath9 . in fermi - gas model",
    "the spin cut - off parameter is determined according to : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the average of the square of the single particle spin projections , @xmath19 is the temperature , @xmath20 is the single particle level density , @xmath21 is the rigid body moment of inertia expressed as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the nucleon mass , @xmath24 is the mass number and @xmath25 is the nuclear radius .",
    "the spin cut off parameter in rigid body model is : @xmath26    on the other hand the gilbert and cameron @xcite used @xmath27 .",
    "the corresponding formula for @xmath10 is :    @xmath28    eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rigid ] ) and  ( [ eq : half ] ) have the same energy and @xmath24 dependence ( @xmath29 ) but differ by a factor of @xmath30 .",
    "it should be mentioned also that the recent model calculations @xcite show the suppression of the moment of inertia at low temperatures compared to its rigid body value .",
    "thus uncertainties in spin cut off parameter transform to corresponding uncertainties of total level densities derived from neutron resonance spacings .",
    "experimentally , the spin cutoff parameter can be obtained only from spin distribution of low - lying discrete levels . however , because of the small number of known spins , the uncertainty of such procedure is large .",
    "it turns out that reported systematics based on such investigation @xmath31 @xcite is different from above expressions for which @xmath32 . at higher excitation energies determining",
    "the cutoff parameter becomes problematic due to the high level density and the absence of the reliable observables sensitive to this parameter .",
    "one can mention ref .",
    "@xcite where the spin cutoff parameter has been determined from the angular distribution of evaporation neutrons with @xmath0 and proton projectiles .",
    "the deviation from the expected @xmath24 dependence has also been reported .",
    "the absolute values of the parameter agree with eq .",
    "( [ eq : rigid ] ) .",
    "the parity dependence of level densities is also not established experimentally beyond the discrete level region . at the neutron binding energy",
    "the assumption is usually made about the equality of negative and positive parity states .",
    "this is supported by some experimental results  @xcite .",
    "however , recent calculations , performed for fe , ni , and zn isotopes , show that for some of them the assumption of equally distributed states is not fulfilled even far beyond the neutron binding energy , up to excitation energies 15 - 20 mev  @xcite .",
    "as is seen from the above considerations , the calculation of the total level density from neutron resonance spacing might contain uncertainties associated with many factors such as the possible deviation from fermi - gas dependence in interpolation region , uncertainties in spin cutoff parameter and inequality of states with different parity .",
    "thus the question of how large these uncertainties are or to what extent the level density extracted in such a way can be applicable to calculations of reaction cross sections still remains important and not completely resolved .",
    "the cross section of evaporated particles from the first stage of a compound - nuclear reaction ( i.e. when the outgoing particle is the first particle resulting from compound nucleus decay ) can be calculated in the framework of the hauser - feshbach theory : @xmath33 with @xmath34    here @xmath35 is the fusion cross section , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are energies of relative motion for incoming and outgoing channels ( @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the separation energy of particle @xmath40 from the compound nucleus ) , the @xmath41 are the transmission coefficients of the outgoing particle , and the quantities @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the energy , angular momentum , and parity of the compound and residual nuclei , respectively .",
    "the energy @xmath44 is the continuum edge , above which levels are modeled using a level density parameterization . for energies below @xmath44",
    "the known excitation energies , spins , and parities of discrete levels are used . in practice @xmath44",
    "is determined by the available spectroscopic data in the literature .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hf ] ) that the cross section is determined by both transmission coefficients of outgoing particles and the nld of the residual nucleus @xmath45 .",
    "it is believed that transmission coefficients are known with sufficient accuracy near the line of stability because they can be obtained from optical model potentials usually based on experimental data for elastic scattering and total cross sections in the corresponding outgoing channel .",
    "transmission coefficients obtained from different systematics of optical model parameters do not differ by more that 15 - 20 % from each other in our region of interest ( @xmath46  mev of outgoing particles ) .",
    "the uncertainties in level densities are much larger .",
    "therefore the hauser feshbach model can be used to improve level densities by comparing experimental and calculated particle evaporation spectra .",
    "details and assumptions of this procedure are described in refs  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this method is that because of the wide range of spin population in both the compound and final nuclei , evaporation spectra are determined by the total level density ( integrated over all level spins ) as opposed to the neutron resonance technique where resonances are known for one or two spins and one parity .",
    "the drawback stems from possible direct or multistep compound reaction contributions distorting the evaporation spectra , especially in the region of low - lying discrete levels needed for the absolute normalization of obtained level densities .    according to hodgson @xcite ,",
    "the interaction process can usefully be considered to take place in a series of stages corresponding to the successive nucleon - nucleon interaction until complete equilibrium is reached . at each stage it is possible for particles to be emitted from the nucleus .",
    "the direct reactions refer to the fast , first stages of this process giving forward peaked angular distribution .",
    "the term multistep direct reaction implies that that such process may take place in a number of states .",
    "compound nuclear reactions refers to all processes giving angular distributions symmetric about 90@xmath47 ; they are subdivided into multistep compound reactions that take place before the compound system has attained final statistical equilibrium and statistical compound reactions that correspond to the evaporation of particle from an equilibrium system .",
    "the use of evaporation spectra to infer level densities requires that the reaction goes through to complete equilibrium .",
    "significant contributions from either multistep direct or multistep compound reactions could cause incorrect level density parameters to be deduced .",
    "multistep direct reactions would usually be forward peaked and also concentrated in peaks .",
    "if the reaction has a limited number of stages , the two - body force can not cause transitions to states which involve a large number of rearrangements from the original state .",
    "multistep compound reactions would be expected to lead to angular distributions which are symmetric about 90@xmath47 .",
    "they would , if complete equilibration has not occurred , also preferentially reach states which are similar to the target plus projectile .",
    "the shape of spectra from a multistep compound reaction would be different for a deuteron - induced as opposed to a @xmath2he - induced reaction .",
    "hodgson has reviewed @xcite the evidence for multistep compound reactions .",
    "he finds the most convincing evidence for such contributions comes from fluctuation measurements for the @xmath48al(@xmath2he , p ) reaction . in this case , certain low - lying states show level widths in the compound system which are larger than expected .",
    "these states are low - lying and are the ones which would be most likely to show such effects .",
    "it appears that measurements of continuum spectra do not show evidence of such contributions .",
    "the uncertainties connected to contributions of pre - equilibrium reactions are generally difficult to estimate experimentally .",
    "the measurement of angular distribution does not solve the problem in the case of multistep compound mechanism .",
    "we believe that the use of different reactions to form the same compound nucleus is the most reliable way to estimate and eliminate such contributions .",
    "in this work we investigate reactions with deuteron and @xmath2he projectiles on @xmath1co and @xmath3fe , respectively . these two reactions form the same compound nucleus , @xmath8ni .",
    "the purpose was to investigate if the cross section of outgoing particles from both reactions can be described in the framework of hauser - feshbach model with same set of level density parameters .",
    "this is possible only when production cross section is due to compound reaction mechanism in both reactions .",
    "neutron , protons , and @xmath0-particles have been measured .",
    "these outgoing particles exhaust the majority of the fusion cross section .",
    "the ratio between cross sections of different particles is determined by the ratio of level densities of corresponding residual nuclei .",
    "it puts constraints on relative level density values obtained from an experiment . in our experiment ,",
    "the level densities of @xmath5ni , @xmath5co , and @xmath6fe residual nuclei have been determined from the region of the energy spectra of neutron , proton , and @xmath0-particles where only first state emission is possible .",
    "the tandem accelerator at ohio university s edwards accelerator laboratory provided @xmath2he and deuteron beams with energies of 10 and 7.5  mev , respectively .",
    "self - supporting foils of 0.625-mg/@xmath49 @xmath3fe ( 82% enriched ) and 0.89-mg/@xmath49 @xmath50 ( 100% natural abundance ) have been used as targets .",
    "the outgoing charged particles were registered by charged - particle spectrometers as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the setup has ten 2-m time - of - flight legs ending with si detectors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sp ] ) .",
    "legs are set up at different angles ranging from @xmath51 up to @xmath52 .",
    "the mass of the charged particles is determined by measuring both the energy deposited in si detectors and the time of flight .",
    "additionally , a neutron detector was placed at the distance of 140  cm from the target to measure the neutron energy spectrum .",
    "the mass resolution was sufficient to resolve protons , deuterons , @xmath53/@xmath2he , and @xmath0-particles .",
    "additionally , the neutron spectra from both the @xmath3fe@xmath54he@xmath55 and the @xmath1co@xmath56 reactions have been measured by the time - of - flight method with the swinger facility of edwards laboratory  @xcite . here a flight path of @xmath57  m has been used to obtain better energy resolution for outgoing neutrons , allowing us to measure the shape of neutron evaporation spectrum more accurately .",
    "the energy of the outgoing neutrons is determined by time - of - flight method . the 3-ns pulse width provided an energy resolution of about 100  kev and 800  kev at 1 and 14  mev of neutrons , respectively .",
    "the neutron detector efficiency was measured with neutrons from the @xmath48al@xmath58 reaction on a stopping al target at @xmath59  mev  @xcite .",
    "this measurement allowed us to determine the detector efficiency from 0.2 to 14.5  mev neutron energy with an accuracy of @xmath60% .",
    "the neutron spectra have been measured at backward angles from @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "additional measurements with a blank target have been performed at each angle to determine background contribution .",
    "the absolute cross section has been calculated by taking into account the target thickness , the accumulated charge of incoming deuteron or @xmath2he beam , and the neutron detector efficiency .",
    "the overall systematic error for the absolute cross sections is estimated to be 15% .",
    "the errors in ratios of proton and @xmath0 cross sections are only a few percents because they are determined by counting statistics alone .",
    "energy spectra of neutron , protons , and @xmath0-particles have been measured at backward angles ( from @xmath63 to @xmath64 ) to eliminate contributions from direct reaction mechanisms .",

    "particle transmission coefficients have been calculated with optical model potentials taken from the ripl data base @xcite .",
    "different potentials have been tested and found to be the same within 15% .",
    "alpha - particle potentials are more uncertain",
    ". differences between corresponding @xmath0-transmission coefficients depends on the @xmath0-energy and varies from @xmath66% for lower @xmath0-energies to @xmath67% for higher @xmath0-energies in our region of interest ( 8 - 18  mev ) . in order to reduce these uncertainties",
    "the ripl @xmath0-potentials have been tested against the experimental data on low energy @xmath68elastic scattering on @xmath3ni @xcite .",
    "the data have been reproduced best by the potential from ref.@xcite which has been adopted for our hf calculations .",
    "four level density models have been chosen for testing :    * the m1 model uses the bethe formula ( [ eq : rho ] ) with parameters adjusted to fit both discrete level density and neutrons s - wave resonance spacings . *",
    "the m2 model uses the gilbert - cameron @xcite formula with parameters adjusted to fit both discrete level density and neutrons s - wave resonance spacings . *",
    "the m3 model uses bethe formula but @xmath13 parameters are obtained from pairing energies according to ref .",
    "the @xmath12 parameter has been adjusted to match s - wave neutron resonance spacing .",
    "this model does not fit discrete levels . *",
    "the m4 model is based on microscopic hartree - fock - bcs calculations  @xcite which are available from ripl data base  @xcite . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , this model has also been renormalized to fit discrete levels and neutron resonance spacings .",
    "the value of total level density derived from neutron resonance spacings depends on spin cutoff parameter used .",
    "therefore two prescriptions ( [ eq : rigid ] ) and ( [ eq : half ] ) for this parameter have been tested for m1-m3 models .",
    "the m4 model uses its one spin distribution which it is close to the prescription ( [ eq : rigid ] ) .",
    "the measured particle energy spectra include particles from all possible stages of the reaction .",
    "however , by limiting our consideration to particles with energies above a particular threshold , we can ensure that only particles from the first stage of the reaction contribute .",
    "these thresholds depend on the particular reaction and are indicated by the arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . in this energy interval cross sections are determined exclusively by the level density of those residual nuclei .",
    "another aspect which should be taken into consideration when comparing calculations and experiment is the contribution of direct processes .",
    "direct processes take away the incoming flux resulting in reduction of compound reaction contribution . assuming that the total reaction cross section ( @xmath69 ) can be decomposed into the sum of direct ( @xmath70 ) and compound reaction mechanisms ( @xmath71 )",
    ", we have @xmath72 . in this case",
    ", the hf calculations should be multiplied by the constant factor @xmath73 to correct for the absorbed incident flux which does not lead to compound nucleus formation . in our experiment",
    "the k has been estimated from the ratio @xmath74 where the experimental cross sections have been measured at backward angles . if level densities used in calculations are correct , @xmath75 .",
    "however , the calculations show that this parameter is not very sensitive to input level densities and can be estimated with @xmath7620% accuracy with any reasonable level density models .",
    "table  [ tab : tab1 ] shows the ratio of theoretical and experimental cross sections for different level density models used in calculations .",
    "calculations have been multiplied by reduction factor k which for both reactions varied within 0.48 - 0.54 for different level density models .",
    "results show that all of the models reproduce neutron cross sections within @xmath7620% . however ,",
    "they overestimate @xmath0-particle cross sections by @xmath7630% in average and underestimate protons by 5 - 80% .",
    "none of the models reproduce the ratio of p/@xmath0 cross section ; for example all models systematically overestimate this ratio by a factor of @xmath762 for the d+@xmath1co reaction . assuming that particle transmission coefficients are known with sufficient accuracy , we conclude that the level density of residual nuclei is responsible for such disagreement .",
    "in particular , the level density ratio @xmath77/\\rho[{^{60}co}]$ ] is overestimated by model calculations .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : tab4 ]",
    "the consistency between results from two different reactions supports our conclusion that these reactions are dominated by the compound - nuclear reaction mechanism at backward angles .",
    "our results show that level densities estimated on the basis of interpolation procedure between neutron resonance and discrete energy regions do not reproduce experimental cross sections of all outgoing particles simultaneously .",
    "the reason is that for some of the nuclei the level density between discrete and continuum regions has a complicated behavior which can not be described by simple formulas based on fermi - gas or gilbert - cameron models .",
    "it is seen for @xmath6fe ( fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3 ] ) where the level density exhibits some step structure at energy around 3.7  mev .",
    "nevertheless , the fermi - gas model can still be used to describe the level density at higher excitation energies where density fluctuations vanish .",
    "the m3 model , which does not use discrete levels , gives best agreement .",
    "however , a problem apparently connected to the spin cutoff parameters is still present .",
    "these results indicate that it is necessary to use level density systematics obtained from compound - nuclear particle evaporation spectra .",
    "obviously , the region of discrete levels should be excluded from such an analysis .",
    "spin cut off parameters obtained from this experiment are in general agreement with model prediction of eqs.([eq : rigid ] ) and ( [ eq : half ] ) .",
    "however it is difficult to reduce uncertainties to make more specific conclusions about the origin of this parameter .",
    "most probably , this parameter fluctuates from nucleus to nucleus and is determined by the internal properties of nuclei such as the specific population of shell orbits .",
    "as it has been discussed in the introduction , level densities affect reaction rates which are important in astrophysics and other applications .",
    "the magnitude of this affect depends mainly on level densities and contribution of the channel of interest to the total reaction cross section . according to the table [ tab : tab1 ]",
    ", the neutron outgoing channel is less sensitive to variations of level densities while changes in proton and @xmath0 cross sections can reach a factor of 2 from corresponding changes in level densities .",
    "changes in predicted cross sections will also occur at this level .",
    "the neutron , proton , and @xmath0-particle cross sections have been measured at backward angles from @xmath2he+@xmath3fe and d+@xmath1co reactions . the calculations using hf model have been performed with three level density models adjusted to match discrete levels and neutron resonance spacings and one model adjusted to match neutron resonances only .",
    "none of the model reproduces cross sections of all outgoing particles simultaneously from both reactions .",
    "however , the model m3 suggested in ref.@xcite gives the best agreement with experiment .",
    "level densities of residual nuclei @xmath5ni , @xmath5co , and @xmath6fe have been obtained from particle evaporation spectra .",
    "experimental level densities have been fit by fermi - gas function and new level density parameters have been obtained .",
    "the new level densities allow us to reproduce all particle energy spectra from both reactions that indicate the dominance of compound nuclear mechanism in particle spectra measured at backward angles .",
    "the contribution of compound mechanism to the total cross section is estimated about 50% for both reactions .    the total level density obtained from particle spectra and neutron resonance spacings",
    "have been used to extract the spin cut off parameter at the neutron separation energies .",
    "the extracted parameters agree with predictions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : half ] ) for @xmath6fe but no definite conclusions can be made for @xmath5ni and @xmath5co .",

    "<S> the energy spectra of neutrons , protons , and @xmath0-particles have been measured from the d+@xmath1co and @xmath2he+@xmath3fe reactions leading to the same compound nucleus , @xmath4ni . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental cross sections have been compared to hauser - feshbach model calculations using different input level density models . </S>",
    "<S> none of them have been found to agree with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> it manifests the serious problem with available level density parameterizations especially those based on neutron resonance spacings and density of discrete levels . new level densities and corresponding fermi - gas parameters </S>",
    "<S> have been obtained for reaction product nuclei such as @xmath5ni,@xmath5co , and @xmath6fe . </S>"
