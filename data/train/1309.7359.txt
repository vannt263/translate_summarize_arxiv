    "studies of alkali atoms in states with large principal quantum numbers @xmath0 , @xmath11 , have demonstrated the remarkable precision with which atomic rydberg states can be controlled and manipulated using one , or more , electric field pulses , and have provided a wealth of new insights into the dynamics of chaotic systems and into physics in the ultra - fast ultra - intense regime  @xcite .",
    "these studies , however , have been limited to singly - excited electronic states by the difficulty of exciting a second electron in the closed - shell core ion .",
    "this restriction can be removed by use of alkaline - earth atoms which have two valence electrons because , following excitation of one electron to a high-@xmath0 state , the presence of the second valence electron leaves a readily - excited optically - active core ion . for low ( total ) angular momentum ( low-@xmath12 ) rydberg states ,",
    "excitation of the core ion leads to rapid autoionization through electron - electron scattering  @xcite .",
    "as @xmath12 increases the autoionization rate decreases and this decrease can serve as a probe of the evolution of the rydberg electron towards high-@xmath12 states .",
    "for sufficiently high @xmath12 the core ion behaves as an independent , essentially - free particle allowing it ( and the rydberg atom ) to be manipulated through optical trapping or imaged through laser - induced fluorescence  @xcite .",
    "the autoionization process has been studied by colliding two radially localized electronic wave packets in barium revealing violent rather than gradual energy transfer between the two electrons  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the presence of the second valence electron also admits the possibility of creating two quasi - stable two - electron excited states in the planetary atom  @xcite or frozen planet configurations  @xcite . by taking advantage of the different energy - level structure of singlet and triplet excited states , attractive _ and _ repulsive inter - atomic interactions in ensembles of rydberg atoms can be realized using the same element  @xcite .",
    "the goal of our ongoing experimental and theoretical efforts is thus to explore the opportunities that strontium provides to probe new aspects of rydberg atom physics related to two - electron excited states created either within a single atom or by forming pairs of strongly - coupled rydberg atoms with well - defined interatomic separation .",
    "central to these studies is the production of very - high-@xmath0 states as these can be readily manipulated using pulsed electric fields  @xcite and have extraordinarily strong long - range interactions . with these applications in mind",
    "we examine here the creation of @xmath13  300 - 500 strontium rydberg atoms via two - photon excitation from the ground state using a crossed atom - laser beam geometry . in the first part of this study",
    ", we explore the creation of strontium @xmath0@xmath2s@xmath3 and @xmath0@xmath2d@xmath4 rydberg states .",
    "large photoexcitation rates are achieved that permit creation of multiple rydberg atoms with internuclear separations approaching those at which rydberg - rydberg interactions become important .",
    "this opens up the opportunity to study strongly - coupled rydberg - rydberg systems under carefully controlled conditions . as a test of the spectroscopic resolution achievable",
    "we obtain the isotope shifts in the series limits for the different strontium isotopes present in the beam .",
    "another focus is on photoexcitation in a dc electric field .",
    "the character of the optically accessible rydberg states changes markedly as the strength of the applied field is increased .",
    "we examine these changes and discuss the possibilities for generation of strongly polarized states , which form the basis of many of the protocols used to engineer rydberg wave packets .",
    "the results are analyzed with the help of a two - active - electron ( tae ) model that employs numerically exact diagonalization of the two - electron hamiltonian containing an empirical potential representing the sr@xmath10 core .",
    "exploiting the @xmath0 scaling for rydberg states allows the comparison of converged numerical results obtained near @xmath14 to data recorded experimentally for @xmath15 .",
    "the experimental apparatus is shown in fig .  [ fig : apparatus ] .",
    "strontium atoms contained in a tightly - collimated beam are excited to the desired high-@xmath0 ( singlet ) state using the crossed outputs of two frequency - doubled diode laser systems .",
    "the first `` blue '' 461  nm laser is tuned to the 5s@xmath16 @xmath2s@xmath3 @xmath17 5s5p @xmath2p@xmath5 transition while the second `` purple '' 413  nm laser drives the transition from the intermediate 5s5p @xmath2p@xmath5 state to the target state ( this two - photon scheme is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : apparatus ] ) .",
    "when crossing the atom beam , the linearly polarized laser beams travel in opposite directions . by means of half - wave plates ,",
    "their polarization vectors can be aligned with either the @xmath18- or @xmath19-axis .",
    "we explore excitation with both collinear ( @xmath19-@xmath19 ) as well as orthogonal ( @xmath18-@xmath19 ) laser polarizations . since the two wavelengths are comparable , the use of counter - propagating light beams can largely cancel doppler effects associated with atom beam divergence resulting in narrow effective experimental line widths .",
    "the strontium atom beam is provided by an oven that can operate at temperatures of up to 680@xmath20c and which can , with appropriate collimation , provide a @xmath61mm - diameter beam with a full width at half maximum divergence of @xmath6 4  mrad at densities approaching 10@xmath21  @xmath8 .",
    "as described elsewhere  @xcite , residual stray fields in the experimental volume are reduced to @xmath22v@xmath23 by application of small offset potentials to the electrodes that surround it .",
    "measurements are conducted in a pulsed mode .",
    "the output of the 461  nm laser is chopped into a series of pulses of @xmath6  0.5  @xmath24s duration and 20  khz pulse repetition frequency using an acousto - optical modulator .",
    "the laser is unfocused and has a diameter of @xmath6  3  mm .",
    "its intensity , @xmath6  10  mw  @xmath25 , was selected to limit line shifts and broadening due to effects such as the ac stark shift and autler - townes splitting  @xcite .",
    "its pulse width , @xmath6  0.5  @xmath24s , is chosen because for shorter pulse durations the widths of the spectral features become increasingly transform limited .",
    "the 413  nm laser remains on at all times and its beam is focused to a spot with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) diameter of @xmath6  170  @xmath24 m , resulting in an intensity of @xmath6  250  w  @xmath25 .",
    "the frequencies of both lasers are stabilized and controlled with the aid of an optical transfer cavity locked to a polarization - stabilized hene laser .",
    "this cavity allows uninterrupted tuning of the lasers over frequency ranges of up to @xmath6  800  mhz . following each laser pulse , the probability that a rydberg atom is created is determined by state - selective field ionization for which purpose a slowly - rising ( risetime @xmath6  1  @xmath24s ) electric field is generated in the experimental volume by applying a positive voltage ramp to the lower electrode .",
    "product electrons are accelerated out of the interaction region and are detected by a particle multiplier . because only one output pulse from the multiplier can be detected following each laser pulse in the present setup , the probability that a rydberg atom is created during any laser pulse is maintained below @xmath6  0.4 to limit saturation effects .",
    "this can be accomplished by reducing the strontium atom beam density by operating the oven at a lower temperature ( @xmath6500@xmath20c ) , and/or by reducing the 413  nm laser power using a neutral density filter .",
    "while alkali atoms are well described by single - active electron models , the same does not hold for alkaline - earth atoms which , in addition to the closed - shell configuration of core electrons , possess two valence electrons .",
    "we analyze the excitation spectra for strontium by means of a two - active - electron ( tae ) model .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an angular - momentum dependent semi - empirical model potential  @xcite representing the sr@xmath10 ion .",
    "the latter includes a core polarization correction and is of the form @xmath28\\nonumber \\\\ & &   -\\frac{\\alpha_{{\\rm cp}}}{2r^{4 } } \\left[1-\\exp[-(r / r_{c}^{\\ell})^{6}]\\right]\\ , , \\label{eq : modelpot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameters , @xmath29 , are obtained by fitting to known energy levels of the sr@xmath30 ion and the experimental core polarizability @xmath31 is @xmath32-independent  @xcite .",
    "( atomic units are used throughout , unless otherwise stated . )",
    "fine - structure ( fs ) corrections are neglected as the preliminary calculations including fs corrections show that they are of minor importance for very high @xmath0 . the atomic eigenenergies and eigenstates are obtained by numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( eq .  [ eq : hamil ] ) .",
    "first , the single - particle orbitals @xmath33 and orbital energies @xmath34 for the sr@xmath30 ion with @xmath35 are generated using the generalized pseudo - spectral method  @xcite .",
    "this method can efficiently describe wave functions on both long and short length scales by using a non - uniform spatial grid optimized for the potential employed .",
    "when fs corrections are included , the orbital energies agree well with the measured values  @xcite . whereas spin - orbit coupling is neglected ( eq .  [ eq : hion ] ) , the calculated energies do agree with the spin - averaged measured values  @xcite . however , measured energy levels for the ionic p - states are available only for @xmath36 which introduces uncertainty in the the model potential parameters . using these one - electron orbitals",
    "the basis states of the two - electron hamiltonian ( eq .  [ eq : hamil ] ) are constructed as @xmath37\\ , , \\label{eq : basis2e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the total angular momentum , @xmath38 is its projection onto the quantization axis , and the clebsch - gordan coefficients are given in terms of 3j symbols as @xmath39 the @xmath40 sign in eq .",
    "( [ eq : basis2e ] ) distinguishes basis states symmetric ( antisymmetric ) with respect to electron exchange in coordinate space representing the singlet ( triplet ) sector . in order to obtain the spectrum in the presence of a dc electric field oriented along the @xmath19-axis , the hamiltonian @xmath41 with the two - electron dipole operator @xmath42 is diagonalized , yielding the desired eigenvalues and eigenstates .",
    "since the principal quantum numbers @xmath43 of the orbitals describe the excited states of the sr@xmath30 ion and not those of neutral strontium , the quantum number @xmath0 of the rydberg atom associated with the calculated eigenstates of the two interacting electrons @xmath44 is assigned in agreement with known excitation series taking into account perturber states .",
    "this is not always straightforward as a few states are hard to identify .",
    "for example , the spectroscopic literature @xcite lists a 4d5p state in the @xmath2p@xmath5 sector while , in agreement with  @xcite , our calculations reveal no state with dominant 4d5p character clearly pointing to a strong departure from an independent - particle description .    in the present work , our interest centers on the spectrum of high-@xmath0 strontium rydberg states associated with excitation of a single electron .",
    "while a few perturber states are important in the low @xmath0 regime , the high-@xmath0 spectrum remains largely unaffected .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath45 of the outer rydberg electron extend over a wide range ; however , those @xmath46 of the inner electron are dominated by a limited number of low - lying states",
    ". we can thus truncate the expansion in terms of orbitals of the inner electron to these dominant orbitals which greatly facilitates the numerical diagonalization .",
    "more precisely , all numerical results presented here employ six inner electron @xmath47 orbitals ( 5s , 4d , 5p , 6s , 5d , and 6p ) . for a fixed component , @xmath48 , and an excited state with principal quantum number @xmath14 ,",
    "the total hamiltonian has a dimension of about @xmath49 . at vanishing electrical field , the latter consists of _ uncoupled _ blocks of constant total angular momentum @xmath12 .",
    "however , for excitation in a dc electric field as considered below , the relevant energy in the vicinity of the target level is identified and the resulting stark matrix to be diagonalized can have a dimension as low as @xmath50 , rendering our truncated - basis approach numerically inexpensive .",
    "convergence is checked by increasing the number of inner electron orbitals until the relative error in the eigenenergies compared with the results using 14 inner electron orbitals is below 0.1% . for high @xmath0 states below the first ionization threshold",
    "the present configuration - interaction method should provide accuracies that are at least comparable to , if not even higher than , r - matrix methods which solve the eigenproblem within a reaction volume of finite radius @xmath51 , the latter being determined by the largest extent of the inner electron configurations .",
    "since quantum calculations of spectra and transition probabilities for @xmath15 using the present tae model are not tractable , we employ scaling relations to extrapolate our converged numerical results for the range @xmath52 to very high @xmath0 . as a starting point",
    ", we employ the well - known classical scaling relations for the rydberg states in a pure coulomb potential : +    [ eq : scaling ] for energies , @xmath53 for electric field strength , @xmath54 for dipole moment , @xmath55 for transition matrix elements from low - lying states @xmath56 to rydberg states , @xmath57 and for the critical fields , @xmath58 , at which states in adjacent @xmath0 manifolds first cross @xmath59    in the presence of the sr@xmath10 core and the additional valence electron , the scaling in @xmath0 [ eq .  ( [ eq : scaling ] ) ] can be extended to the effective quantum number @xmath60 of the rydberg - ritz formula  @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ritz ] ) , @xmath61 is the @xmath0 independent but @xmath32 dependent quantum defect while the @xmath0 ( or energy ) dependent correction is given by the ritz coefficient , @xmath62 .",
    "our strategy is now to determine @xmath62 and @xmath61 by diagonalizing the model hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamil ] ) in the basis [ eq .  ( [ eq : basisryd ] ) ] truncated at @xmath63 . from the resulting series of energy eigenvalues and transition matrix elements ( @xmath64 ) , we can , provided they are free from the influence of perturber states ,",
    "extrapolate to very high @xmath0 employing the scaling relationships [ eq .  ( [ eq : scaling ] ) ] and",
    "the effective quantum numbers @xmath65 .",
    "as a first test of the tae model we compare ( see fig .  [",

    "overall , our tae energy values agree well with the experimental data as do the results of multichannel quantum defect theory  @xcite and of r - matrix calculations  @xcite which employ the same semi - empirical model potential .",
    "however , a small discrepancy between theory and experiment is seen for the quantum defects of the p and d states , i.e. , the calculated values slightly underestimate the measured quantum defects and we return to this in a moment .",
    "the effective quantum defects increase with @xmath0 , especially for d states yielding a non - vanishing ritz coefficient @xmath67 .",
    "the value for p states , @xmath68 , is significantly smaller while the coefficient for s states @xmath69 is close to zero . in the series limit , the calculated values of the @xmath0-independent quantum defects @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are slightly lower than the measured values @xmath70 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 . for lower @xmath0",
    ", @xmath75 deviates strongly from simple single - electron coulomb scaling signaling the presence of perturber states in the two - electron system .",
    "these deviations are , however , of negligible importance for the high-@xmath0 limit of interest here .",
    "adjusting the model - potential parameters and/or including dielectric core polarization terms  @xcite yields nearly identical results , still underestimating the measured quantum defects .",
    "this is due to the fact that , for all model potentials employed , the calculated energy levels of the sr@xmath76 ion exhibit deviations from the measured values which are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the precise estimation of the quantum defect , however , requires accurate values not only of the energy of the excited state but also of the ionization threshold .",
    "thus , small but finite errors in ionic energies are passed on to the energy values of neutral strontium and become non - negligible for high-@xmath0 levels .",
    "alternatively , it is possible to optimize the model potential in order to minimize these deviations . for the present two - photon excitation study we chose the model potential of ref .",

    "the first transition provides a sensitive test of the limitations of independent - electron models .",
    "this transition is strongly influenced by configuration mixing , closely connected to the inclusion of the 4d5p @xmath2p@xmath5 configuration among the members of the 5s@xmath0p @xmath2p@xmath5 manifold mentioned previously .",
    "the collective , i.e. , multi - electron , character of the transition is reflected in an oscillator strength exceeding unity .",

( [ eq : scaling]c ) ] are observed .",
    "most prominent is the cooper minimum near @xmath82 in the excitation probability to the @xmath2d@xmath4 states .",
    "the observed minimum is associated with a change of sign in the dipole matrix elements . to our knowledge , this cooper minimum has not been reported in the literature .",

    "the width of the measured lines is principally attributed to transit time broadening ( the transit time of an atom through the 413  nm laser spot is @xmath6  300  ns ) with smaller contributions from the finite laser pulse width and fluctuations in the laser frequencies during the @xmath6  1  s accumulation time for each data point in the spectrum .",

    ", the measured excitation rate of @xmath2d@xmath4 states is smaller than the theoretical prediction indicating that the enhanced ratio is due to a suppression of @xmath2s@xmath3 state excitation rather than an enhancement of @xmath2d@xmath4 state excitation .",
    "it is instructive to compare the excitation spectrum calculated within the present tae approximation with the results of a single - active - electron ( sae ) model with a model potential similar to that described in ref .",

    "for applications involving strongly coupled rydberg atoms , it is crucial to achieve high excitation densities which poses a challenge given the @xmath88 scaling of the oscillator strength .",
    "we have therefore measured the strontium rydberg excitation rates that can be achieved in the beam .",

    ", the second transition has a width @xmath107  mhz and thus a rabi period of about 2@xmath108 . given the relatively long atomic transit time , @xmath109  ns , through the 413  nm laser beam , a linear ( fermi golden rule ) estimate would likely overestimate the excitation probability .",
    "therefore , this probability is obtained using the rabi formula @xmath110)/2(\\omega^{2}+\\delta^{2})$ ] , where @xmath111 is the detuning .",
    "if the excitation is considered as an incoherent sequence of two transitions , the total rydberg excitation probability is given by the integral ( over the detuning ) of the product of the two lorentzian excitation profiles .",
    "this approach yields an excitation probability of @xmath6  1% per atom .",
    "given the estimated strontium atom beam density of @xmath112  @xmath8 this would suggest creation of rydberg atom densities of @xmath113  @xmath8 rydberg atoms per laser pulse which are somewhat higher than the experimental measurements .",

    "the small difference in the scaled stark spectrum between the energy levels calculated ( for the `` 52@xmath2d@xmath4 '' ) state and those measured ( for the `` 312@xmath2d@xmath4 '' ) state result from the fact that the calculated zero - field quantum defects are somewhat smaller than the experimental values ( fig .",

    "this can be easily understood by recalling that the classical runge - lenz vector gives the direction of the major axis of the kepler ellipse .",
    "a wide distribution of @xmath146 implies an ensemble of kepler ellipses with @xmath152 whose major axes are broadly distributed . for non - hydrogenic atoms that possess a sizable quantum defect , such a distribution results from core scattering which rotates the orientation of the ellipse while maintaining its eccentricity .",
    "a minimum in the @xmath144-distribution is seen near @xmath153 which mirrors a node of the spherical harmonic @xmath154 .",
    "as @xmath134 is increased this node shifts towards negative @xmath144 and the @xmath144-distribution becomes increasingly asymmetric indicating that the state becomes , indeed , gradually polarized .",
    "when in the stark map ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : stark ] ) the state merges with the neighboring stark manifold , its @xmath144-distribution becomes narrow consistent with evolution towards a narrow range of parabolic states .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the @xmath144-distribution of the `` 52p '' state [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_k ] ] which shows little sign of asymmetry even as the neighboring manifold is approached suggesting that the state is only weakly polarized .",
    "the pronounced difference between d and p states arises because p states couple strongly only with adjacent s and d states , both of which are difficult to polarize .",
    "the d states , on the other hand , directly couple with neighboring f states which merge with the stark manifold at relatively small values of @xmath134 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_k ] ] and become polarized .",
    "the sizable polarization of the `` 52d '' state , therefore , results from strong coupling to this polarized `` 50f '' state . in agreement with this line of reasoning ,",

    "the `` 52d '' state lies between the two states `` 52p '' and `` 50f '' to which it is dipole coupled ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stark ] ) .",
    "the coupling with the `` 50f '' state is dominant leading to polarization on the `` downhill '' side . as the applied field increases",
    ", the growth of the dipole moment becomes non - linear in @xmath134 due to the increasing importance of the higher - order perturbation terms , i.e. , the strong mixing with higher @xmath12 states .",
    "the states can then become strongly polarized and , as seen for the `` 50f '' and `` 52d '' states , their polarizations can approach the limiting value of @xmath161  a.u .",

    "in fact , for spectroscopy of isolated strontium rydberg atoms it was necessary to reduce either the beam density or the laser intensity . the photoexcitation spectra recorded in the presence of a dc field suggest it should be possible to create strongly polarized rydberg states by exciting `` @xmath0d '' states in dc fields approaching the crossing field @xmath162 .",
