    "as such the interference pattern not only makes the search for an optimum beam problematic but crucially renders the superposition found unreliable , as the different algorithms may converge on different local minima which are unstable with respect to the different initial parameters in the problem .",

    "next , we conclude from the measured relative soim @xmath158 that the spot size decreases if the roi size is reduced .",
    "the reduced spot size is achieved at the expense of the spot intensity which is redistributed to a ring outside of the roi similar to the theoretical results presented in section  [ s : sec34 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . referring to the exp - s data , for @xmath161 the spot size",
    "is reduced to @xmath162 of the size of the reference bessel beam s core and even further to @xmath163 for @xmath164 .",
    "the latter result is somewhat vague , though , due to the low spot intensity which may be truncated by the sensitivity threshold of the ccd detector and thus may appear smaller .",
    "however , our experimental results overall clearly verify the qme concept applied to spot size minimization . moreover",
    ", the results strongly suggest that the qme optimization may indeed squeeze spots to the subdiffractive regime since the optimal superposition of bessel beams not only beats the airy disk but also the reference bessel beam .     within the roi depending on the roi radius @xmath89 in pixel for numerical superposition of the fields @xmath151 in the ccd plane.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "we have performed an additional comparison of the experimental results to the theoretically predicted ones : the relative soim @xmath158 was evaluated for the num - s for roi radii ranging from @xmath165 to @xmath166 in steps of one pixel ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : somvsr ] ) . in comparison to the corresponding graph shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we observe agreement in terms of both the general decrease of @xmath158 with decreasing @xmath89 and the peaks occurring periodically along the @xmath89-axis . surprisingly , for @xmath167 , we do not observe values of @xmath168 ; that is the qme spot minimization does not deliver , as one might naively expect , the reference bessel beam featuring the smallest soim @xmath156 of all bessel beams considered .",
    "this is due to the ring structure of bessel beams which significantly adds to the soim and therefore to the spot size in the case of large rois . as a consequence ,",
    "the qme optimization aims to superimpose the set of bessel beams in a manner that the rings are destructively interfered within the roi , only retaining the central core .",
    "given that the ring structure is essential for the reduced core size of bessel beams compared to the diffraction limited airy disk we observe values of @xmath28 which are larger than @xmath102 .",
    "indeed , the values of @xmath28 are fairly close to the size of the airy disk which was determined as @xmath169 .",
    "this strongly suggests that for large rois the qme spot minimization yields a superposition of bessel beams which closely resembles the diffraction limited airy disk .",
    "finally , we remark that for @xmath170 the relative soim @xmath158 becomes very small and has to be taken with care due to the possible truncation of the spot mediated by the ccd detector s sensitivity threshold as mentioned above .",
    "we have theoretically and experimentally demonstrated a novel approach based on quadratic measures eigenmodes that enables the optimization of different optical measures . the theory that we employ is rigorous and based on considering the light - matter interaction as a quadratic measure originating from the fields described by maxwell s equations .",
    "excitingly , we can define many quadratic measure operators to which our approach is applicable ( see table [ tab ] ) .",
    "the method is thus very powerful and the generic nature of our approach means that it may be applied for example to optimize the size and contrast of optical dark vortices , the raman scattering or fluorescence of any samples , the optical dipole force , and the angular / linear momentum transfer in optical manipulation . in the present paper",
    "we have verified the rigor of the method by demonstrating experimental spot size operator and intensity operator optimization using laguerre - gaussian and bessel light modes using a dual slm approach to implement the technique .",
    "we envisage the qme approach as providing a powerful and versatile theoretical and practical toolbox .",
    "our generic approach is applicable to all linear physical phenomena where generalized fields interfere to give rise to quadratic measures .",
    "we thank the epsrc nanoscope basic technology consortium for funding .",
