    "for many decades supernovae ( sne ) have been a focus of scientific interest , as sources of heavy elements and cosmic rays , a fundamental process shaping gas dynamics in galaxies , and , more recently , as cosmological distance indicators .",
    "sn explosions can be roughly divided into two main categories : type ia events ( sne ia ) are believed to be thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf stars , while all other sne result from core - collapse of massive progenitor stars .",
    "the great cosmological utility of sne ia ( e.g. , riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ; riess et al .",
    "2004 ) spurred intensive studies of this sn sub - type .",
    "both detailed studies of individual nearby events , and numerous works characterizing the properties of the sn ia population , have been published .",
    "this is not the case , however , for core - collapse sne",
    ". while some individual core - collapse events are very well studied ( e.g. , sn 1987a ) the properties of the population of these events are not well known - e.g. , the average peak magnitude and light curve shape , the distribution around this average , the typical spectroscopic properties and their evolution , etc .",
    "recently , several possible drivers for change have emerged .",
    "the connection between hydrogen - deficient core - collapse sne ( sne ib / c ) and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; stanek et al .",
    "2003 ; hjorth et al . 2003 ; matheson et al .",
    "2003 ) resulted in great interest in these events .",
    "the possible usefulness of hydrogen - rich core - collapse sne ii - p as distance estimators ( e.g. , hamuy & pinto 2002 ) may offer an independent method to test type ia cosmology .",
    "the need to know the average properties of core - collapse sne in order to interpret the results from surveys for sne at high redshift has been demonstrated by several works ( e.g. , dahlen & fransson 1999 ; sullivan et al .",
    "2000 ; gal - yam , maoz and sharon 2002 ; sharon 2004 ; dahlen et al . 2004 ) and will become even more urgent when larger planned surveys with the snap and jwst space missions are carried out .",
    "the caltech core - collapse project ( cccp ) is a large observational program , designed to study a complete sample of nearby core - collapse sne , using mainly the hale 200  and the robotic 60  telescopes at palomar observatory .",
    "the program will provide high quality optical ( @xmath1 ) light curves , as well as multiple - epoch spectroscopy and ir photometry , for _ all _ nearby ( @xmath2 ) core - collapse sne that are visible from palomar and that have been discovered young ( no more than 30 days after explosion ) .",
    "we select young events using available photometry ( e.g. , sne discovered on the rise ) or recent non - detections ( i.e. , sne that are absent from images obtained no more than 30 days prior to discovery ) .",
    "young sne are identified as core - collapse events either through prompt spectroscopy obtained by us ( e.g. , leonard et al .",
    "2004 ) or reported by the community , or using photometric typing methods ( e.g. , poznanski et al . 2002 ; gal - yam et al . 2004a ; rajala et al .",
    "including only young events in our sample removes strong selection biases for bright or long - lasting events ( such as sne ii - p ) .",
    "the compilation of well sampled optical light curves , as well as multiple epoch spectra and ir photometry , will allow us to fully characterize , observationally , each event in our complete sample , providing a firm foundation for studies of core - collapse sne as a population .",
    "cccp also provides data for other sn initiatives pursued at caltech : multiwavelength studies of sne ib / c and their possible connections with grbs ( soderberg , kulkarni et al . ) ; and testing sne ii - p as cosmological probes in effort to verify sn ia cosmology ( ellis and collaborators ) .",
    "cccp will also support other major efforts by the sn community , e.g. , the large cycle 13 hst program to study sne ia in the uv ( pi filippenko ) , and a similar cycle 1 galex program to study core - collapse sne in the uv ( pi gal - yam ) .",
    "the cccp project officially began on august 2004 , and first results are encouraging .",
    "the robotic 60  telescope delivers accurate , well sampled @xmath1 light curves ( figure 1 ) , while the first 200  runs supplied high quality spectra and nir photometry ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the project is approved to continue through july 2005 .",
