    "magnetic arms are spiral - shaped segments of enhanced large - scale magnetic field , sometimes observed between the optical ( and gaseous ) arms of spiral galaxies .",
    "they were first observed in the galaxy ic  342 @xcite and later in the galaxy ngc  6946 @xcite . in ngc  6946",
    ", magnetic arms have pitch angles similar to those of the gaseous arms ; they lag the gaseous arms by 20@xmath0 , so that the two spiral systems apparently do not intersect @xcite . in m51",
    ", they partially overlap with the optical arms showing an intertwined pattern @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is opposite to what is expected of a frozen - in magnetic field , whose strength increases with gas density , and thus favours a dynamo origin of the large - scale galactic magnetic fields .",
    "it is not quite clear how widespread is this phenomenon among spiral galaxies and what causes it .",
    "several attempts have been made to explain interarm large - scale fields in the context of the mean - field dynamo theory .",
    "@xcite addressed this problem with a model of mhd spiral density waves , but using rather simplified configurations of magnetic fields and galactic rotation curves .",
    "@xcite took the turbulent magnetic diffusivity to be larger in the gaseous arms or the @xmath1 effect to be weaker .",
    "@xcite assumed that the correlation time of interstellar turbulence is larger within the gaseous arms .",
    "however , weak , if any , observational or theoretical evidence is available to support the assumptions used in these models .    from the generic form of the dynamo non - linearity , @xcite concluded that the steady - state large - scale magnetic field can be stronger between the gaseous arms",
    "if the dynamo number is close to its critical value for the dynamo action , i.e. , magnetic arms interlaced with gaseous arms can occur in galaxies with a weak dynamo action .",
    "@xcite argued that stronger turbulence in the gaseous arms , driven by higher star formation rate , would produce stronger turbulent magnetic fields leading to the saturation of the large - scale dynamo at a lower level .",
    "however , stronger star formation may not lead to stronger turbulent motions in the warm phase , the site of the large - scale dynamo action .",
    "the turbulent velocity is limited by the sound speed in the warm gas ( @xmath2 for a wide range of star formation rates ) .",
    "extra energy injected by enhanced star formation mostly feeds the hot phase of the interstellar gas and enhances gas outflow from the galactic disc .",
    "moreover , the effects of the small - scale field on the dynamo could be more subtle @xcite than envisaged by @xcite .",
    "@xcite extended the mean - field dynamo equations to allow for a finite relaxation time @xmath3 of the turbulent electromotive force .",
    "this results in dynamo equations that admit wave - like solutions and thus might produce magnetic arms in a way reminiscent of how a spiral pattern is produced by density waves .",
    "however , the wave - like behaviour turns out to be insignificant for realistic values of @xmath3 .",
    "if the @xmath1 effect is stronger in the gaseous arms , a finite @xmath3 of a realistic magnitude can produce magnetic arms lagging by @xmath4@xmath5 behind the respective gaseous arms , similar to what is observed in ngc  6946 .",
    "most of the above models use a rigidly rotating spiral , and thus only produce non - axisymmetric fields near the corotation radius , because of strong differential rotation of the gas .",
    "this is at odds with observations showing radially extended magnetic arms in some galaxies .",
    "such a feature can be reconciled with more modern theories of spiral structure , where the spirals can wind up or can be due to interfering rigidly rotating patterns @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed a systematic drift of magnetic arms from the gaseous arms in their numerical model with an evolving spiral pattern .",
    "these results suggest that magnetic arms should be studied in a broader context of diverse spiral pattern models .",
    "a simple , natural and direct effect of the gaseous spiral arms on the mean - field dynamo was suggested by @xcite who found that dynamo action is sensitive to galactic outflows .",
    "this links the dynamo efficiency directly to star formation rate which is confidently known to be higher within the gaseous arms . in the milky way , ob associations that drive gas outflows concentrate in spiral arms @xcite .",
    "the hi holes caused by hot superbubbles and chimneys , and the vertical flows driven by them , tend to be concentrated in the spiral arms of ngc  6946 @xcite .",
    "there is also evidence for non - axisymmetric distributions of the extra - planar in other galaxies , suggesting a non - axisymmetric outflow pattern @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to demonstrate , using a nonlinear galactic dynamo model incorporating realistic spiral evolution models , that magnetic arms can be sustained between the gaseous arms due to a stronger gas outflow along the gaseous spiral .",
    "galactic outflows ( winds or fountains ) facilitate the mean - field dynamo action by removing helical turbulent magnetic fields from the disc which would have otherwise catastrophically quenched the dynamo @xcite .",
    "however , as outflows also remove the total field , the dynamo is damaged if the outflow is too strong , so there is an optimal range of outflow speeds .",
    "in addition , other fluxes of magnetic helicity , such as a turbulent diffusive flux , may also help to avert catastrophic quenching .",
    "these effects are captured by a simple , yet remarkably accurate approximate solution of the dynamo equations , the no-@xmath6 approximation @xcite .",
    "this solution yields the following expression for the steady - state ( saturated ) strength of the mean magnetic field @xmath7 written in the cylindrical frame @xmath8 with the origin at the galactic centre and the @xmath6-axis aligned with the angular velocity @xmath9 @xcite : @xmath10 with @xmath11\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath12 is a dimensionless measure of the outflow intensity , with @xmath13 the mass - weighted mean vertical velocity and @xmath14 the scale height of the dynamo - active layer .",
    "further , @xmath15 is the mean - field turbulent diffusivity , with @xmath16 the turbulent scale and @xmath17 the rms turbulent speed .",
    "@xmath18 is the ratio of the diffusivity of the mean current helicity and the diffusivity of the magnetic field . denoting the gas density by @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the field strength for which there is energy equipartition between magnetic field and turbulence . for convenience",
    "we have also made use of the notation @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the magnetic pitch angle , and is related to the magnetic field by the expression @xmath23 .",
    "finally , @xmath24 is the dynamo number @xcite , a dimensionless measure of the induction effects of differential rotation and helical turbulence .",
    "there is a critical dynamo number @xmath25 , such that the kinematic growth rate of the mean magnetic field is positive ( negative ) for @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "thus , equation   applies for @xmath28 ; otherwise @xmath29 is effectively zero . in the no-@xmath6 approximation ,",
    "the critical dynamo number is given by @xmath30    the quantity @xmath31 is expected to be closer to its optimum value for dynamo action in between the gaseous arms than within them , causing the large - scale magnetic field to concentrate in the interarm regions . to verify and test this idea ,",
    "consider whether this can occur for realistic values of galactic parameters .",
    "we denote with subscripts ` a ' and ` i ' quantities within the gaseous arms and between them and for convenience we define the parameter @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 is a measure of the arm ",
    "interarm contrast in the outflow speed ; it vanishes if there is no such contrast , and @xmath34 if there is no outflow in the interarm regions .",
    "it is reasonable to take @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; from equation   for @xmath37 we then have @xmath38 .",
    "the first of these ratios @xmath39 , which leaves @xmath40 .",
    "we adopt @xmath41 in the illustrative example of this section , and we also set @xmath42 .",
    "we then obtain from equation   the arm ",

    "fig : bai ] .    note that concentration of magnetic field in the interarm regions becomes more likely with increasing @xmath33 .",
    "raising @xmath58 causes @xmath59 to increase , shifting the contours to the left and enlarging the region of @xmath45 space that satisfies the above conditions ( @xmath60 is not affected ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of changing the ratio @xmath61 is just to relabel the contours so , e.g. , halving @xmath61 causes the contour @xmath48 to become @xmath62 , making the condition @xmath57 easier to satisfy .     contours of the arm - interarm contrast in magnetic field strength , @xmath44 , in the @xmath45-plane for @xmath41 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",

    "the dynamo is supercritical in the interarm regions , and the large - scale magnetic field is stronger in the interarm regions as compared to in the arms . ]",
    "we see then that a larger value of the magnetic field in the interarm regions compared to that in the arms is possible for realistic dynamo parameters .",
    "note that the mechanism is most effective for dynamo numbers close to critical , large ratios of the arm / interarm outflow speeds , and large ( in absolute terms ) outflow speeds in the arms .",
    "thus , magnetic arms can be displaced from the gaseous ones in galaxies with a relatively weak large - scale dynamo action .",
    "we now put these ideas on a firmer footing by considering a more detailed numerical model .",

    "[ fig : d ] , model  d ( shown for @xmath79 ) also produces fairly strong ( @xmath156@xmath157 ) magnetic arms interlaced with the gaseous ones , but extended in radius with pitch angles similar to those of the gaseous spiral .",

    "the degree of deviation from axial symmetry varies with time as the spiral winds up .",
    "[ fig : delta_time ] shows that the maximum value of @xmath158 first increases with time for models with @xmath79 ( solid ) and @xmath159 ( dashed ) , and peaks a few hundred @xmath160 after the onset of the spiral .",
    "evidently , stronger magnetic arms are produced when @xmath3 is finite @xcite ; even for this case they are concentrated in between the gaseous arms .",
    "the location of the maximum of @xmath158 moves outward with time , from @xmath161 ( @xmath162 ) at @xmath163 to @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) at @xmath166 for @xmath79 ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "this outward propagation is explained by the increase with radius of the local response time to the spiral perturbation @xcite .",
    "predictably , smaller @xmath167 ( weaker non - axisymmetric forcing ) produces weaker magnetic arms , with @xmath168 reduced in proportion to @xmath167 in model  d. changing @xmath169 has little effect on @xmath158 but reduces @xmath29 by more than a factor of two as @xmath169 is reduced from 1 to 0 , i.e. , when the flux of @xmath78 through the disc surface is reduced to that due to advection alone .",

    "@xmath158 decreases substantially ( almost by 40 per cent ) as @xmath114 is reduced ( from 3 to @xmath112 ) , while @xmath29 increases slightly ( @xmath171 per cent ) . for the mechanism to be viable ,",
    "the outflow must be strong enough to affect the dynamo in the gaseous arms , but not strong enough to suppress it globally .",
    "our results are not very sensitive to the degree of flaring . for an unflared disc with @xmath172 ,",
    "@xmath14 is larger ( smaller ) than the flared disc inside ( outside ) @xmath173 ; this leads to a slight reduction in @xmath158 for @xmath174 and a slight increase for @xmath175 .",
    "this finding is not surprising because larger scale height translates to a more supercritical dynamo number , and thus results in weaker magnetic arms , as explained in section  [ sec : outflow ] .",
    "we have shown that magnetic arms situated in between the gaseous spiral arms can be generated when the mean outflow speed @xmath13 is stronger in the gaseous arms , independently of the spiral model used .",
    "this assumption of spiral modulation of the outflow speed is supported , to some extent at least , by observation and theory , and its impact on the dynamo is simple and direct . in particular , if the gaseous arms wind up as transient density waves , an interlaced pattern of magnetic and gaseous arms can persist in a wide radial range , as observed in some galaxies .",
    "the fact that at least some observations can be better explained using such models of spiral structure and evolution lends support to those models .    the mechanism proposed is most effective when the dynamo is close to critical .",
    "if stronger magnetic fields enhance the formation rate of massive stars @xcite , leading to stronger outflows , the dynamo could be self - regulated to remain near critical . in any case",
    ", our tentative prediction is that galaxies with higher star formation rates , and hence stronger outflows , are more likely to possess magnetic arms in between the gaseous ones .",
    "indeed , the galaxies in which interarm magnetic arms have been identified are found to be gas - rich @xcite .",
    "we intend to extend our models to include the three - dimensional structures of the disc and outflow and observationally constrained parameter values for specific galaxies .",
