    "are engineered structures composed of sub - wavelength artificial unit cells that form a homogeneous effective medium for the electromagnetic waves propagating through them .",
    "this effective response can be described by a coarse - grained electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability  @xcite . by manipulating these two electromagnetic parameters , interesting properties unavailable in nature",
    "have been demonstrated , such as negative refractive index  @xcite and artificial magnetism  @xcite .",
    "most metamaterials are designed to give a magnetic response at microwave or higher frequency bands  @xcite .",
    "they usually employ split ring resonators ( srrs ) , or their derivatives , and can be generally understood with a lumped - element inductor - capacitor circuit model  @xcite .    as the wavelength , @xmath1 , of the electromagnetic waves increases towards the radio frequency ( rf ) band , miniaturizing the inclusions forming a metamaterial becomes more challenging  @xcite .",
    "the swiss roll metamaterial  @xcite , a three dimensional ( 3-d ) geometry which inspired the srr design , has achieved a reasonable magnetic response in the sub-100 mhz band . since the design is implemented with normal metals ( thick cu sheets separated by dielectrics ) , ohmic losses and bulkiness are the limiting factors .",
    "the most important usage of rf metamaterials reported so far is in magnetic resonance imaging devices  @xcite ; however they can function in a wide variety of applications including magneto - inductive lenses  @xcite , rf antennas  @xcite , filters and compact resonators  @xcite .",
    "our nb rf metamaterials are constructed from micro - structured 2-d spirals .",
    "earlier experiments  @xcite utilized planar spirals made of thick cu films ( @xmath035 @xmath4 m thick in  @xcite and @xmath00.25 mm thick in  @xcite ) on dielectric substrates .",
    "such thick coatings are required to minimize ohmic losses , making the design intermediate between 2-d and 3-d .",
    "further reduction of the resonant frequency of such spirals is not possible due to the scaling of ohmic dissipation with spiral length .    because the electrical size of the elemental spiral is significantly smaller than the operating wavelength",
    ", a quasi - static approach can be used , and the design can be based on a lumped element analogy as in srrs  @xcite . the large number of turns gives a significant geometrical inductance , @xmath5  @xcite and the spacing between them provides substantial capacitance , @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the geometry can be kept compact enough to achieve a sub-100 mhz resonance frequency , @xmath7 ( despite the large @xmath1 ) .",
    "since the design is realized with superconducting films , there is an additional term called kinetic inductance , @xmath8  @xcite which is closely linked to the superfluid density .",
    "for example , when the transition temperature , @xmath3 , is approached , the superfluid density goes to zero , and @xmath8 can make the dominant contribution to the total inductance , resulting in a significant reduction in @xmath9 .",
    "the fabrication starts with the deposition of 200 nm nb thin films on 350 @xmath4 m thick quartz substrates , 3 \" in diameter , by the rf sputtering technique  @xcite .",
    "the transition temperature of the film is found to be @xmath10 k from resistance measurements taken by a physical property measurement system ( ppms )  @xcite .",

    "1 shows the resistance of the nb film for a wide range of temperature from 300 k down to 1.5 k , whereas the top - left inset focuses on the transition region .",

    "the etching is performed by a chemically active mixture of / ( 10@xmath11 ) .",

    "the rf transmission measurements are carried out on single elements of our rf metamaterials in an evacuated cryostat at temperatures ranging from 300 k down to 4.2 k. the sample is mounted between two rf magnetic loop probes , 6 mm in diameter , whose axes are parallel to each other and the nb spiral , as shown in the inset of fig .",

    "the data are taken at @xmath15 = 4.3 k with an input power of 10 dbm and demonstrate a fundamental resonance at 74 mhz as well as harmonics located above 100 mhz . the rf current density in the spiral at those resonance modes",
    "are examined with laser scanning microscopy ( lsm )  @xcite in fig .",

    "these images can be interpreted as showing approximately the local current density squared flowing in the windings of the spiral ( light is large , dark is small current ) .",

    "3 ) , the resonance peaks are independent of rf input power and are of lorentzian shape ( the solid curves are fits to the data ) .",
    "as seen from the figure , larger separation between magnetic loops leads to sharper transmission peaks , and consequently to a higher loaded quality factor , @xmath19 , which is calculated as  @xcite @xmath19 = @xmath20/@xmath21 , where @xmath20 is the frequency at which the peak is located ( i.e. resonance frequency ) and @xmath22 is the bandwidth where @xmath23 is 1.5 db below its peak value ( see the top - left inset of fig . 5 ) .",

    "@xmath29 is the sum of power dissipated in the cavity ( ohmic losses ) , radiated power , and power leaking out of the spiral through the coupling loops .",
    "since the measurements are done well below @xmath3 , ohmic and dielectric losses should be the smallest sources of dissipation .",
    "we find that the largest dissipation is due to the coupling losses from the rf loop probes . to confirm this , we have simulated the transmission curves numerically on a lossless single spiral of @xmath12 = 6 mm having the same dimensions as those used in the experiments shown in fig .",
