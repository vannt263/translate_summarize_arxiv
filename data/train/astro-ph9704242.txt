    "it has been suggested by sunyaev and churazov ( 1984 ) that it might be possible to detect the hyperfine transition of a li - like @xmath0fe@xmath1 ion line in clusters of galaxies .",
    "hyperfine transitions have been very important in astronomy .",
    "the first such transitions was predicted for neutral hydrogen atoms ( the famous 21 cm line ) by van de hulst in 1945 and detected in 1951 .",
    "atomic hyperfine splitting is the result of the interaction between the magnetic moment of the nucleus and the magnetic moment of the electron plus the magnetic field generated by the circulating electrons . in the case of the hi 21 cm hyperfine transition at 1420 mhz ,",
    "the ground state @xmath2 is split into 2 sublevels .",
    "deuterium has a similar line predicted at 327 mhz but there have been no detections to date despite many efforts .",
    "the spontaneous transition probability ( or einstein coefficient ) of the hi hyperfine transition is very low , @xmath3 sec@xmath4 .",
    "however , external excitation mechanisms such as collisions with other h atoms and electrons or ly@xmath5 radiation increase the transition rates enormously .",
    "hyperfine splitting is not present for all atoms or ions , since the interaction between the nuclear magnetic moment and the electronic magnetic moment does not occur if either of them is zero . we know from quantum mechanics that the total nuclear angular momentum ( or nuclear spin ) is zero for nuclei with an even number of protons and neutrons , and that the total electronic angular momentum of an ion with completely filled electron shells is zero .",
    "thus the commonly available isotope of iron @xmath6fe has no hyperfine structure .",
    "however , sunyaev and churazov ( 1984 ; sc ) pointed out that the li - like @xmath0fe@xmath1 ion exhibits hyperfine structure with a higher spontaneous transition rate ( @xmath7 sec@xmath4 ) than that of the hi hyperfine transition ( @xmath8sec@xmath4 ) , which compensates the low abundance of the @xmath0fe isotope ( @xmath0fe/@xmath6fe=2.3% ; vkening 1989 ) . the wavelength of the @xmath0fe@xmath1 hyperfine transition has been calculated theoretically to be 0.3071(3)cm ( shabaeva & shabaev 1992 ) .",
    "the fwhm of the line is 40 mhz ( or 130 kms@xmath4 ) , assuming a cluster gas temperature of @xmath9k and that the line width is due to thermal doppler broadening alone .",
    "clusters of galaxies are known to possess hot gas of temperature @xmath10k .",
    "this intracluster medium is found to be metal rich with typically half solar abundance ( sarazin 1988 ) .",
    "the early x - ray observations detected the prominent `` 7 kev fe line '' which is a blend of fe@xmath11 and fe@xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 lines .",
    "the detection of this line not only provided the concrete proof that the primary x - ray emission mechanism for clusters is thermal bremstralung , but also showed that the intracluster gas has nearly solar abundances and that at least some of the gas must have been ejected from galaxies .",
    "other fe lines at lower energy such as fe@xmath1 l lines have been detected at @xmath15 kev in clusters .",
    "thus we know that fe@xmath1 is abundant in cluster environments .",
    "sc had estimated the @xmath0fe@xmath1 line strength in the centre of the perseus cluster to be @xmath16 mk , assuming a central temperature of 1.4 kev inside a 10 - 20 kpc radius with an x - ray emission integral of @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "the detection of the @xmath0fe@xmath1 line will have significant astrophysical implications on our understanding of the properties of the galaxy clusters .",
    "firstly , it will provide us with a direct measure of the dynamics of the icm , such as turbulence and accretion flows .",
    "there have been great debates on the formation of tailed radio sources in clusters of galaxies ( e.g. burns _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 ; odonoghue _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; roettiger _",
    "1993 ) , with some suggesting that the sources are bent by their motions through the icm and others suggesting that the bending is the result of an intracluster wind .",
    "this debate would benefit greatly from a direct measure of the intracluster turbulence .",
    "secondly , mm observations of the @xmath0fe@xmath1 line will complement the x - ray measurements of the distribution of iron in clusters and measure the @xmath0fe/@xmath6fe ratio which would determine the nucleosynthesis history of the intracluster gas .",
    "finally , the mm line would provide a direct and high precision measure of the cluster redshift since the spectral resolution at mm - wavelength is much higher than in x - rays .",
    "our search for the @xmath19 3.1-mm @xmath0fe@xmath1 line was carried out in 1996 september using the mopra telescope of the australia telescope national facility .",
    "the antenna is 22 m in diameter of which the inner 15 m is illuminated by the 3-mm feed , giving a beam width ( fwhm ) of 45  and gain of 40 jy k@xmath4 .",
    "the receiver is a cooled sis mixer with receiver temperature of 80 k which was checked with hot - cold load measurements twice during the seven day observation period .",
    "pointing was tested by using sio masers , the largest pointing error measured was 10  .",
    "atmospheric opacity was checked by skydips , the zenith opacity varied between 0.06 and 0.12 for all but a few hours during the run .",
    "the spectrometer is an autocorrelator with two sections , each covering 256 mhz with 256 channels ( 1 mhz per channel ) .",
    "we overlapped these two by 125 mhz so as to cover a total bandwidth of 384 mhz .",
    "roughly 50 mhz on each side are compromised by the if filter shape , leaving a total bandwidth with consistent sensitivity of about 285 mhz which translates to 920 km s@xmath4 at a wavelength of 3.2 mm ( the redshifted wavelength ) .",
    "since the line width is not well known , we do not remove baselines from the spectra , but simply edit the records on the basis of their raw rms noise .",
    "each record consists of a pair of two minute on and off source spectra from which we take the difference normalized by the bandpass shape .",
    "the reference position is offset by six minutes of right ascension .",
    "the expected spectral rms per record is about 20 mk , which is what we find in almost all cases . a few records ( @xmath20 ) show significantly higher noise due to baseline instabilities in the if system .",
    "they are removed from the average . with this editing , the rms noise in the average decreases as integration time @xmath21 up to our maximum integration time of 10.5 hours .",
    "because the spectra have not been baseline fitted , there remains some structure in the average spectra , but it is quite broad band ( typically 100 mhz wide or greater ) .",
    "this baseline structure limits our ability to detect broad lines .",
    "the clusters which we are searching for the @xmath0fe line are at redshifts of @xmath22 . assuming rest frequency of @xmath23 ghz ( @xmath19 = 3.0713 mm ) the cluster center frequencies come out in the range 92 - 92.5 ghz .",
    "more nearby clusters would not necessarily give stronger signals , since the beam size of 45  translates to only 35 h@xmath4 kpc for a cluster at a redshift of 16,000 km s@xmath4 .",
    "thus the emission region is probably considerably larger than the beam .",
    "this is the reason for taking the reference position so far from the source .    as tests of the sensitivity and stability of our system and observing strategy , we have observed several calibration lines .",
    "the first test is simply to check the pointing using sio masers at 86 ghz .",
    "we did these pointing checks every few hours for the first several days of the run observing five positions offset by a half beamwidth from the tabulated source position .",
    "we always detected the masers within 10  of their nominal positions and with their nominal line strengths . since both the beam size and the cluster sizes are much larger than this we have not introduced any pointing offsets .",
    "this test is limited in that the 86 ghz sio frequency requires a different receiver tuning than the 92 ghz @xmath0fe line , so we checked the receiver performance by observing test lines at 92 ghz .",
    "the best candidates are @xmath24cs line from orion ( sio position ) and m17sw , whose frequency is 92.494 ghz and the h41@xmath5 recombination line at 91.955 ghz which we observed in the 30 dor region of the large magellanic cloud .",
    "the @xmath24cs line is so strong that it shows up in a single on - off pair , but the h41@xmath5 line is weak enough to provide a good test of a moderately long integration .",
    "our spectrum of this test line is shown in figure 1 ; the position chosen was the 20-cm continuum peak at 05:38:46.675 , -69:04:58.6 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the total integration time is 112 minutes and the noise level is 2.5 mk , 2.0 mk would be predicted by the radiometer equation , so the system is evidently performing well for integration times of an hour or so .",
    ".summary of observations [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     table 1 lists the clusters which we have searched for @xmath0fe emission . columns 1 - 3 give the cluster name and position , column 4 gives the integration time on - source , column 5 gives the detection threshold , and column 6 gives the useful velocity range .",
    "the detection threshold is a strong function of the width of the line because we have subtracted no baselines from our spectra .",
    "the threshold given on table 1 applies to lines narrower than about 150 km s@xmath4 in full - width . for broader lines the residual baselines in the receiver system begin to degrade our detection threshold",
    "this effect is illustrated in figure 2 , which is the pair of spectra for the cluster a85 for the two spectrometer channels .",
    "the vertical offset between the two is arbitrary , here it has been set at 6 mk for convenience . one channel is dominated by a linear baseline , while the other shows primarily a quadratic baseline shape .",
    "if we were to remove first and second order baselines and align the two channels we would obtain a spectrum with no features above 2 mk or less ( depending on the smoothing ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if cluster lines are as broad as several hundred km s@xmath4 then this baseline removal could remove a real feature , and so our threshold would have to be raised ; we can not rule out the lump between 16200 and 16500 km / s being part of a real feature of strength 3 mk and linewidth @xmath25300 km s@xmath4 . for linewidths of 200 km",
    "/ s or greater we must set the threshold at 5 mk in this case . for the other clusters on table 1",
    "there are similar baseline irregularities that set the maximum linewidth corresponding to the threshold at about 150 km / s .",
    "following the formalism given in sunyaev and churazov ( sc;1984 ) , we can calculate the expected line intensity for a cluster given the cluster gas parameters derived from x - ray observations .",
    "the peak brightness temperature of the @xmath0fe@xmath1 hyperfine transition should be @xmath26 where @xmath27,@xmath28 are the statistical weights of the hyperfine sublevels , @xmath29 is the doppler line width ( i.e. the half - width at @xmath30 of the maximum ) , @xmath5 is the cluster isotope abundance relative to hydrogen and the function @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the spontaneous transition probability , @xmath34 is the fraction of ions of a given species at temperature t , @xmath35 is the occupation number of the microwave background at the wavelength of transition , @xmath36 is the excitation coefficient by resonance scattering which is the dominant excitation process ( sc ) . note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi1 ] ) differs slightly from equation  ( 2 ) in sc ( see appendix ) .    in the case of clusters of galaxies where @xmath37 ( or @xmath38 @xmath18 ) , eq .",
    "( 2 ) is reduced to @xmath39 assuming a constant temperature , we have from eq .",
    "( 1 ) and eq .",
    "( 3 ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the x - ray surface brightness .",
    "if we assume solar abundance for clusters , where solar @xmath0fe abundance was taken to be @xmath42 ( sc ) , and isothermal cluster gas temperature within the mopra beam to be at its optimum value of @xmath9k where @xmath34 has its peak value of @xmath43 ( jacobs _ et al .",
    "_ 1977 ) , we can deduce a simple relation between the peak brightness temperature of the @xmath0fe line and the x - ray surface brightness : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the peak brightness temperature of the line in units of mk before convolution with the beam of the radio telescope , and @xmath41 is the x - ray surface brightness in units of ergss@xmath4@xmath46ster@xmath4 in the rosat band of [ 0.1,2.4 ] kev after corrections for the telescope response and galactic absorption . in the case of an average cluster of galaxies , where @xmath47 @xmath18",
    ", the peak brightness temperature would be @xmath48 mk .",
    "however in the centre of cooling flow clusters of galaxies where the central density could be as high as @xmath49 @xmath18 , the peak brightness temperature could only reach @xmath50 mk in the most extreme cases , contrary to the estimate of @xmath51 mk given by sc for the perseus cluster .",
    "the cluster a85 is considered a classic example of a cooling flow cluster with high x - ray luminosity and thus one of the best candidates for this experiment . to obtain a realistic prediction for the @xmath0fe line brightness for a85",
    ", we examine the x - ray data available for the cluster .",
    "the rosat pspc data for a85 has been analysed by pislar _",
    "( 1996 ) , who found an x - ray luminosity of @xmath52 ergs s@xmath4 within a radius of 1.4 mpc in the rosat band of [ 0.1 - 2.4]kev .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness was fitted with a @xmath53 model given by , @xmath54^{-3\\beta+1/2}\\ ] ] which corresponds to @xmath55^{-3\\beta/2}\\ ] ] for the electron density distribution , where @xmath56@xmath18 , @xmath57 and @xmath58kpc ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "however , the surface brightness profile obtained with the rosat hri ( prestwich _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) which has a resolution of @xmath60 ( c.f . @xmath61",
    "the pspc ) clearly shows that there is an excess above the @xmath53 model within the central @xmath61 radius .",
    "taking the x - ray surface brightness from hri , we obtain from the above relation a peak brightness temperature of 0.003 mk for the @xmath0fe line .",
    "this predicted line brightness can be increased , if the abundance of @xmath0fe is significantly different from the terrestrial abundance and/or the distribution of fe increases towards the centre .",
    "however , such effects are unlikely to increase the detectability of the line by more than a factor of 10 .",
    "this analysis shows that the expected brightness temperature of the @xmath0fe line to be @xmath62 mk in cluster cores , even for an archetype cooling flow cluster such as abell 85 .",
    "we have shown that the mopra telescope can reach a sensitivity level comparable to the original prediction given by sc of the line intensity but is certainly inadequate given the more realistic estimates shown above .",
