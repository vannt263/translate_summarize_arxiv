    "following the discovery in 1961 of @xmath17 meson in @xmath18 reactions  @xcite , the measurements of forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath19 suggested the existence of a rho - like resonance in the @xmath3-wave , later referred to as @xmath16 scalar meson  @xcite .",

    "furthermore , in 1973 , pennington and protopopescu used analyticity and unitarity constraints on partial wave amplitudes in @xmath21 scattering ( roy equations ) to show that a narrow @xmath16 resonance can not contribute to @xmath22 scattering  @xcite . from these facts",
    "it was concluded that @xmath16 does not exist and in 1974 particle data group dropped this state from its listings . + in 1972 , van rossum and his spin physics group at saclay reported the first measurements of recoil nucleon polarization in @xmath23 elastic scattering made at cern at 6 and 16 gev / c  @xcite .",

    "the expectation that these intensities should be similar in this mass range can be traced to the isospin structure of the amplitudes which originates in the assumption of generalized bose - einstein symmetry for two - pion states .",
    "the assumption of generalized bose - einstein symmetry leads to three relations that must be satisfied by combinations of partial wave intensities of @xmath14 , @xmath38 and @xmath45 production for even dipion spins . in a sequel paper",

    "wald showed that any scattering process of particles that evolves pure initial state into a mixed final state violates @xmath12 symmetry and is time irreversible  @xcite . in 1982",
    "hawking showed that in the presence of a black hole ( macroscopic or microscopic ) a pure initial state of interacting particles will evolve into a mixed final state as some of the quantum states produced in the particle interaction will fall behind the horizon and become inaccessible to measurements by the observer  @xcite .",
    "he also suggested that quantum fluctuations of the space - time metric will have the same effect on interacting particles and induce their non - unitary evolution - at any energy  @xcite .",
    "hawking questioned the universal validity of the unitary time evolution in quantum field theory in the presence of metric fluctuations and suggested that initial and final state density matrices @xmath54 and @xmath55 are connected by a linear but non - unitary evolution superoperator .",
    "+ hawking s ideas inspired suggestions to test them experimentally . in 1984 , ellis , hagelin , nanopoulos and srednicki proposed that quantum fluctuations of the metric form an environment with which interacting as well as free particles interact as open quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "such interactions would lead to an observable change of coherence and @xmath12 violations in @xmath56 systems . over the years other suggestions to test hawking s ideas have been put forward  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments with free neutral kaons have yielded remarkably sensitive results on violations of @xmath12 symmetry , time reversal invariance and entanglement of kaon pairs  @xcite .",
    "so far these experiments did not provide a conclusive confirmation of a non - unitary evolution , and thus possible evidence for quantum gravity effects .",
    "+ in our previous work  @xcite we returned to the original hawking s idea and searched for evidence of a non - unitary evolution of pure initial states of interacting particles into mixed final states in the existing cern data on @xmath0 on polarized target at 17.2 gev / c .",
    "the purity of the final state @xmath48 is controlled by the purity of the recoil nucleon polarization .",
    "we developed a spin formalism to calculate the expressions for recoil nucleon polarization for two specific measured initial pure states . imposing the condition of purity on the recoil nucleon polarization we obtained conditions on the amplitudes which are violated by the model independent amplitude analyses of the cern data on polarized target at large momentum transfers .",

    "the central hypothesis put forward in this work is that the two states are the same states .",
