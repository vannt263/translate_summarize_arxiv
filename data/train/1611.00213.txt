    "actinide / be - based radioactive sources are typically used for cost - effective fast - neutron irradations .",
    "neutrons are produced when the @xmath4-particle from the decay of the actinide interacts with the @xmath5be nucleus .",
    "if one is only interested in neutrons , a major drawback associated with these sources is the gamma - ray field produced by the original actinide .",
    "higher - energy gamma - rays are also produced via the @xmath4 + @xmath5be @xmath6 n + @xmath3c@xmath7 reaction . however ,",
    "if detected , these 4.44  mev gamma - rays can be used to  tag \" the corresponding neutrons  @xcite , resulting in a polychromatic energy - tagged neutron beam . in this paper , we employ the neutron - tagging technique to measure tagged , fast - neutron yields from @xmath0ambe and @xmath1pube using a ne-213 liquid - scintillator detector .",
    "we also measure the corresponding untagged gamma - ray yields using a cerium - bromide ( cebr@xmath2 ) detector .",
    "our goal was to measure the tagged - neutron yields provided by the two sources and indentify which provided the higher tagged - neutron yield .",
    "for the investigations performed in this work , both @xmath0am/@xmath5be ( am / be ) and @xmath1pu/@xmath5be ( pu / be ) sources were employed . both actinides decay predominantly via the emission of @xmath4-particles . according to nudat  @xcite , @xmath0am decays via the emission of 25 different @xmath4-particles ( 5.4786  mev weighted - mean energy ) while @xmath1pu decays via the emission of 14 different @xmath4-particles ( 5.4891  mev weighted - mean energy ) .",
    "the difference in the weighted mean @xmath4-particle energies is thus only about 10  kev .",
    "when these @xmath4-particles interact with @xmath5be , fast neutrons are produced . because the weighted mean of the incident @xmath4-particle energies is essentially the same for both actinides ,",
    "the energy spectra of emitted neutrons are anticipated to demonstrate strong similarities .",
    "these neutrons have a maximum energy of about about 11  mev  @xcite .",
    "if the recoiling @xmath3c is left in its first - excited state , the freed neutron is accompanied by an isotropically radiated prompt 4.44  mev de - excitation gamma - ray .",
    "the radiation fields associated with these sources are thus a combination of the gamma - ray field associated with the original actinide together with 4.44  mev gamma - rays and their associated fast - neutrons .",
    "our am / be source radiates approximately 1.14  @xmath8  10@xmath9 neutrons per second  @xcite , while our pu / be source radiates approximately 2.99  @xmath8  10@xmath9 neutrons per second  @xcite , both nearly isotropically .",

    "ne-213  @xcite is a standard organic liquid scintillator which has been employed for several decades for detecting neutrons in strong gamma - ray fields .",
    "because gamma - ray induced scintillations in ne-213 are generally fast ( 10s of ns decay times ) while neutron induced scintillations are much slower ( 100s of ns decay times ) , the type of radiation incident upon the ne-213 scintillator may be identified by examining the time structure of the scintillation pulses . the ne-213 liquid - scintillator detector employed in this measurement consisted of a 3  mm thick cylindrical aluminum cell ( 62  mm long @xmath8 94  mm @xmath10 ) coated internally with ej-520 tio@xmath11-based reflective paint  @xcite which contained the ne-213 .",

    "the ne-213 detector triggered on both gamma - rays and neutrons produced by the source .",
    "neutron time - of - flight ( tof ) and thus energy was determined by detecting both the fast neutron in the ne-213 detector and the prompt correlated 4.44  mev gamma - ray in a yap(ce ) detector . by tagging the neutrons in this fashion ,",
    "the neutron yield as a function of kinetic energy was measured .",
