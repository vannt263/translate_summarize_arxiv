    "in the currently favored cosmological scenario , the matter content of the universe is dominated by a cold and dark component of unknown particle species whose only significant interaction with the smaller baryonic matter fraction occurs through the gravitational force .",
    "this `` cold dark matter '' ( cdm ) picture is most strongly required by observations on the largest scales @xcite .",
    "the cdm scenario holds that galaxies form within the potential wells of extended dark - matter halos which began their collapse while baryonic matter was still ionized @xcite .",
    "this view is supported by direct evidence for dark matter in disk galaxies from the observation of rotational velocities that remain approximately constant out to radii at which the stellar galactic component makes a diminishing contribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    unlike disk galaxies , early - type galaxies ( e and s0 ) are generally pressure supported and lack bright kinematic tracers at large radii such as h@xmath1 .",
    "as such their kinematics are more difficult to measure and interpret in terms of mass density profiles .",
    "the density structure of early - type galaxies is nevertheless of great interest for numerous reasons .",

    "hierarchical cdm galaxy - formation theories hold that early - type galaxies are built through the merging of late - types @xcite , which should have predictable consequences for the structure of the merger products",
    ". the most stringent test of these theories will require precise observational measurements of early - type mass profiles .",
    "for example , detailed measurement of the structure of high - surface - brightness early - type galaxies will enable quantitative tests of the cdm theory on scales where baryonic and radiative processes have significant effects upon the structure of the host dark - matter halo ( e.g.  through  adiabatic contraction ",

    "second , early - type galaxies exhibit great regularity in their photometric , spectroscopic , and kinematic properties , as described , e.g. , by the well - known fundamental plane ( fp ) relation between velocity dispersion , effective radius , and surface brightness @xcite . the `` tilt '' of the fp relative to the simple expectation of the virial theorem",
    "can be understood in terms of a dependence of galaxy structure and mass - to - light ratio on total galaxy mass @xcite . however ,",
    "further constraints on the mass structure of early - type galaxies are needed in order to distinguish between the various effects of differing stellar populations ( the explanation given by , e.g. , @xcite ) , differing density profiles ( `` structural nonhomology '' or `` weak homology '' ) , and differing dark - matter fractions ( the explanation of , e.g. , @xcite ) in giving rise to the fp .    despite great progress",

    "strong gravitational lensing provides the most direct probe of mass in early - type galaxies : a measurement of the mass enclosed within the einstein radius .",
    "when combined with a spatially resolved measurement of the line - of - sight velocity - dispersion profile and the surface brightness of the lens galaxy , this mass measurement can be used to constrain the luminous and dark - matter mass profiles simultaneously through the jeans equation ( e.g.  kt ) .",
    "unfortunately , only a handful of known strong lenses are amenable to this type of analysis , often because the back - ground source is a bright qso whose images outshine the lens galaxy .",

    "systems falling into category ( 3 ) could in principle be mistaken for bona fide strong lenses , but can be expected to have ill - fitting lens models , since real lenses occupy only a small subspace of all conceivable image configurations . for simplicity , this paper only categorizes acs - observed systems into `` strong lenses '' on one hand and `` everything else '' on the other , with `` everything else '' including systems for which a definitive explanation can not be made based on the data in hand ( i.e.  acs non - detections ) .    to determine the incidence of strong lensing , we examine the f814w and f435w residual images formed by subtracting smooth models of the foreground galaxy constructed as described in appendix  [ bsplineapp ] .",

    "this figure encompasses systems that may indeed be strong lenses as well as systems that appear to be definite _ non_lenses .",
    "we note that a significant number of systems that we consider possible but not definite lenses show a faint candidate counterimage near the center of the foreground galaxy opposite a more prominent image at larger radius . if these features were all due to simple residual error in the foreground galaxy subtraction , this configuration would not be expected .",
    "the features could conceivably be explained by the prominent image `` pulling '' the foreground - galaxy model to the side , leading to an under - subtraction of the foreground - galaxy flux near the center on the opposite side .",
    "we believe this explanation is unlikely since we have taken care to mask neighboring images when fitting the foreground - galaxy model ( appendix  [ bsplineapp ] ) , and we do not see any corresponding over - subtraction on the near side of the core .",
    "the most asymmetric double lenses will in general have faint counterimages at small angular offset from the lens center and will be the most difficult lenses to confirm , although their status as lenses or non - lenses can have a significant impact on statistical inferences based on the lens sample .",

    "the question can be framed between two alternatives : do we select simply for spectral superposition caused by a chance foreground - background coincidence , or is there some significant bias by which galaxies with certain properties are more likely to be selected as lens candidates based on their sdss spectra ? to test this possibility",

    "we construct a control sample of sdss galaxies with the same redshift and velocity dispersion ( within the uncertainties)quantities for which we explicitly select  and test whether the lens galaxy is typical of galaxies in the control sample in terms of its magnitude , color , effective radius , and isophotal ellipticity",
    " quantities for which we do not explicitly select .",
    "although this is not a definitive test of the representative nature of our lenses ( it will not uncover any `` hidden variable '' bias ) , it is straightforward , robust , and informative . by forming control samples at the redshift of the lenses ,",
    "we avoid the necessity of applying evolution- and @xmath81-corrections to the broadband magnitudes .",
    "we may perform our comparison sensibly for galaxies with velocity dispersions well - measured by sdss .",
    "we exclude the lens sdssj1251@xmath80208 from the analysis , both because its spectral signal - to - noise ratio is too low for a confident velocity - dispersion measurement and because its h@xmath75 equivalent width exceeds our quiescent threshold .",
    "( in fact , it is a bulge - dominated spiral - galaxy lens ) .",
    "the double - lens galaxies sdssj1618@xmath134353 and sdssj1718@xmath136424 are also excluded , as is the lens sdssj1205@xmath134910 , which has significant flux from a neighboring galaxy within the sdss spectroscopic fiber .",
    "this leaves a well - defined sample of 15 single early - type lenses .",
    "the comparison sample for each lens consists of unique galaxies from the sdss database with redshifts within @xmath82 of the lens redshift , velocity dispersions within @xmath83kms@xmath3 ( approximately the median velocity - dispersion error of the sample ) of the lens galaxy , and median signal - to - noise per spectral pixel greater than 8 . for lrg - sample targets",
    ", we also require the comparison sample to pass the photometric lrg cuts , and for the main - sample lenses , we require a rest - frame @xmath84  .",
    "we make a luminosity - distance correction to the broadband magnitudes and an angular - diameter - distance correction to the effective radii within the redshift slice to place all galaxies closer to the exact redshift of the lens .",
    "the resulting individual comparison samples have as few as 17 and as many as 1793 galaxies , with a mean of 451 and a median of 337 control galaxies per lens galaxy .",
    "we would like to answer the question of whether our lenses have observables ( luminosities , colors , effective radii , and ellipticities ) consistent with having been drawn from the distribution of those observables seen in the control samples . since we only have one lens at each redshift , a straightforward kolmogorov - smirnov test of the lens sample against the control samples is not possible : even under the null hypothesis , each individual lens has a different parent distribution .",
    "we may however put all these parent distributions on common footing by using the fact that the test is invariant under a monotonic rescaling of the variable under consideration . specifically , for each individual lens s control sample , there exists a transformation of the observable of interest that converts the control distribution into a uniform distribution between the minimum and maximum values . the correspondingly transformed lens observable is simply equal to the normalized rank ( between 0 and 1 ) of the lens quantity within the cumulative distribution of the control sample in that quantity .",
    "thus we may perform a one - dimensional test of the distribution of lens - observable ranks against a uniform distribution over the interval 0 to 1 .",
    "this test is in some sense like a rank - correlation test within the formalism : does ranking as a lens correlate with ranking in luminosity , color , size , or ellipticity ?",
    "figure  [ ksplot ] shows the cumulative distributions of lens rankings in @xmath85 ( magnitude ) , @xmath86 ( color ) , @xmath87 ( effective radius ) , @xmath88 ( isophotal axis ratio ) , and @xmath89 ( @xmath85-band effective surface brightness : @xmath90 ) within their control samples . from these distributions",
    "we compute the statistic @xmath91 , equal to the maximum difference between the cumulative rank distribution and the null - hypothesis distribution .",
    "since the parent distribution under the null hypothesis is known exactly by construction ( uniform probability for any rank between 0 and 1 ) , and since the total number of control galaxies is much larger than the number of lenses , we compute the significance of @xmath91 for a distribution of 15 values against a known parent distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "( the statistical significance of an outlying lens will be limited by a smaller control sample in that its rank is at least @xmath92 and at most @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the number of galaxies in its control sample . )",
    "the resulting probabilities of the lens sample having been drawn at random from the control - sample distributions in @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 are 0.097 , 0.655 , 0.264 , 0.550 , and 0.085 respectively . in terms of color and axis",
    "ratio , the slacs lenses seem to be a representative sample of the parent distribution of sdss galaxies . however ,",
    "the distribution of slacs galaxies in brightness and effective radius ( and hence in surface brightness ) is somewhat significantly skewed towards brighter and more centrally concentrated systems .",
    "this trend is in the same sense as that of the fp : at fixed velocity dispersion , brighter galaxies have smaller effective radii .",
    "paper ii shows that the slacs lenses fall on the local fp corrected for stellar evolution , and further examines the degree of lens bias towards higher effective surface brightness in the context of the fp .",
    "although the statistical significance is not great , the trend is at first glance suggestive of the effect that more centrally condensed objects are more efficient gravitational lenses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to the extent that stellar mass constitutes the dominant lensing component .",
    "a larger sample of similarly selected lenses will allow us to test this selection effect with greater statistical significance .",
    "possible interpretations of this finding  as discussed in detail in papers ii and iii  include observational selection effects due to the finite size of the sdss fiber which may bias our survey towards the highest surface brightness lens galaxies .",
    "in paper iii we will see that , within the context of powerlaw mass models , the slacs lens sample shows great homogeneity in the slope of the total mass density profile ( @xmath95 ) and no significant correlation between @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "this uniform degree of mass concetration within the lens sample itself argues somewhat against a lens - selection bias due to mass concentration , but this argument is limited by the lack of an equally direct probe of the mass distribution in the non - lens control sample .",
    "the large number of new strong lenses confirmed by the slacs survey demonstrates the technical feasibility of carrying out spectroscopic surveys for strong gravitational lenses , and suggests that similar gravitational lens surveys should be considered as explicit goals of future large - scale spectroscopic surveys .",
    "the slacs results are particularly notable when one considers that this type of lens survey was never one of the science or design goals of the sdss , and the survey is thus a testament to the performance of the sdss telescope and spectrograph , and to the optimal quality of the sdss spectroscopic data pipeline . with the clarity of hindsight , we may identify those particular features of the sdss that were beneficial to the spectroscopic lens survey project and those that could conceivably be improved in any future survey to increase the yield of spectroscopically selected strong lenses suitable for specified science goals .",
    "the large parent sample of galaxies observed is a clear advantage afforded by the sdss for this project or any other rare object survey .",
    "empirically , we have found that spectroscopic lenses and lens candidates appear with a frequency on the order of one in a thousand in the sdss : starting with @xmath80 early - type galaxies is therefore one key to success . at the same time , the large number of highly magnified galaxies that we have found close to the spectroscopic detection limit ( note the generally low emission - line signal - to - noise ratio in the discovery spectra of figure  [ specfig ] ) suggests that we may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg .",
    "we conclude that ( 1 ) a spectroscopic lens survey will always be at an advantage if it can `` piggy back '' on a more broadly conceived spectroscopic survey that does not have lenses as its sole scientific goal , and ( 2 ) future spectroscopic surveys that go significantly deeper than the sdss should , all other factors being equal , discover a significantly larger fraction of gravitational lenses",
    ".    one might suspect that a significant factor for slacs survey is the large ( 3arcsec diameter ) aperture of the sdss spectroscopic fibers .",
    "certainly a larger fiber will always collect more photons , but for lenses with image splittings of @xmath97 ( i.e.  @xmath98 einstein radii ) such as we have presented here , a 3arcsec fiber could afford an advantage over smaller fibers disproportionate to its larger aperture due to the concentration of lensed flux away from the center of the fiber .",
    "we can test the importance of this aperture - size effect by simulating observations with varying fiber apertures .",
    "we assume an einstein radius of @xmath99 ( an approximate median value from paper iii ) and an exponential - disk background galaxy with a disk scale length of @xmath100 .",
    "we compute lensed images for a range of source - galaxy impact parameters using a singular isothermal sphere lens model .",
    "we then smear the images with @xmath101 seeing ( the median sdss spectroscopic seeing for our targets ) and integrate over the 3arcsec diameter sdss fiber . if we reduce the fiber aperture to 2arcsec in diameter , we find that the flux collected from the lensed galaxy is reduced to a fraction of @xmath102@xmath103 , depending on impact parameter .",
    "this is essentially the factor of @xmath104 corresponding to the diminished aperture size .",
    "thus for lenses of the angular size typical of slacs lenses , the advantage of a large fiber is just the simple advantage of a large aperture due to the smearing effects of seeing ; a smaller fiber would not have lost a disproportionate amount of line flux due to lensing geometry . however , for lenses with larger image splittings ( which would occur for higher redshift sources behind the same foreground galaxies ) , a small fiber would likely be a qualitative disadvantage to a spectroscopic lens survey . because a fiber - diameter much greater than 3 arcsec would probably increase spurious non - lensed interlopers , we conclude that the sdss fiber - size represents a very good compromise , when searching for massive early - type lens galaxies at these redshifts .",
    "for two principal reasons , our spectroscopic survey owes much success to having targeted lens candidates with background redshifts confirmed by multiple emission lines .",
    "first , the incidence of false - positive spectroscopic detections and emission - line mis - identifications is negligible .",
    "second , to fixed line - flux limits , intermediate - redshift emission from 3727 , 5007 , and the hydrogen balmer series is more common than lyman-@xmath75 emission at high redshift @xcite , and thus we see an abundance of oxygen / balmer lenses .",
    "however , for optical surveys , this survey strategy limits the background redshifts to @xmath105 , beyond which h@xmath106  and 5007  move out of the observable band .",
    "there is a definite incentive to discover significant numbers of lenses with higher lens and source redshifts , both to probe evolution in the lens population and to observe lensed images at larger physical radii within the lens galaxy in order to obtain greater leverage on dark - matter halos .",
    "therefore in designing future surveys to discover gravitationally lensed emission - line galaxies at higher redshift , two obvious considerations are increased survey depth to detect a fainter population , and increased spectroscopic resolution beyond the @xmath107 resolution of the sdss in order to split the 3727  doublet and resolve the characteristic asymmetric profile of lyman-@xmath75 emission ( thus permitting more secure single - line redshifts )",
    ".    one of the greatest uncertainties at the outset of the slacs survey was simply the fraction of strong lenses within the candidate list .",
    "one can attempt to calculate the lensing probabilities of the candidates given @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , assuming a model for the sdss spectroscopic observations , and assuming a luminosity function ( lf ) and size / shape for the background emission - line galaxies , as was done in @xcite , but the ingredients are all uncertain . to put it simply",
    ", we did not know beforehand whether or not the majority of our targets would owe their high - redshift line emission to the psf - smeared wings of bright unlensed galaxies at large impact parameter rather than to einstein - ring images of faint galaxies closely aligned with the sdss target galaxy .",
    "the high ratios of lenses to non - lenses and of quads / rings to doubles that we see are suggestive of a large magnification bias in our selection , with highly magnified faint lensed galaxies detected with greater frequency than less magnified lensed galaxies or unlensed projections .",
    "future work will quantify the extent of any such magnification bias , and will derive statistical constraints on the lens and source populations based on the incidence of lensing within the survey .",
    "the _ hst _ cycle13 slacs survey has produced a catalog of 19 previously unknown early - type strong gravitational lens galaxies .",
    "the @xmath108% fraction of genuine lenses within the the first 28 candidates observed shows that the survey strategy ",
    "spectroscopic candidate selection from within the sdss , followed by _",
    "hst_-acs snapshot observations of the systems with the largest estimated lensing cross sections  is an efficient means for the discovery of new gravitational lenses ; similar lens surveys should be considered as an explicit goal of future spectroscopic surveys . by targeting galaxies with the",
    "highest estimated lensing cross sections , the cycle13 slacs survey has effectively selected high - mass lensing galaxies ( strong lensing cross section is simply proportional to lens mass within the einstein radius ) .",
    "the natural selection of lenses in other surveys is also weighted by lensing cross section , and thus strong lenses are typically massive galaxies . during _ hst _",
    "cycle14 , we will extend our survey to galaxies of lower mass in order to use strong lensing and stellar dynamics to measure the mass dependence of early - type galaxy structure and mass - to - light ratio .",
    "these galaxies will have a lower lensing cross section and hence should have a lower lensing rate , although magnification bias may skew the distribution of candidates in favor of lenses over non - lenses .",
    "the final combined lens sample will be a unique resource for the detailed measurement of the mass profile of early type galaxies within the effective radius .",
    "the slacs sample represents the largest single catalog of uniformly selected early - type gravitational lens galaxies assembled to date .",
    "the lensed images provide an aperture mass constraint within a typical scale of @xmath109 .",
    "the slacs lens galaxies are all brighter than their lensed background galaxies by many magnitudes , and are thus ideally suited to detailed photometric measurement as with the current acs data .",
    "they are also excellent candidates for spatially resolved spectroscopy to constrain dynamical galaxy models in combination with the mass constraints from strong lensing .",
    "in fact , nearly all of the slacs galaxies already have well - measured luminosity - weighted velocity dispersions inside the 3arcsec sdss fiber ( see table  [ galtab ] ) , and thus we have already nearly tripled the number of known gravitational lenses with known stellar velocity dispersions .",
    "paper iii will present the constraints on the logarithmic slope of the total radial density profile ( luminous plus dark matter ) that can be obtained by combining lens models with the aperture - integrated sdss velocity dispersions .",
    "we may derive tighter constraints and a significant decomposition into luminous and dark components by obtaining spatially resolved line - of - sight velocity dispersion measurements within the lens galaxies ( see kt ) .",
    "an analysis of the distribution of slacs lens - galaxy photometric and structural parameters within control samples from the sdss database shows that the slacs lenses are typical of their sdss parent sample with regard to color and ellipticity .",
    "the location of slacs lens galaxies within the fp is the subject of paper ii .",
    "however , the slacs lens galaxies exhibit a somewhat significant bias towards brighter and higher surface - brightness galaxies at fixed redshift and velocity dispersion (  [ sec : stats ] ; see also paper ii ) .",
    "the significance of this bias can be confirmed with a larger sample of similarly selected lenses , which we plan to obtain with the continuation of our acs survey during _ hst _ cycle14",

    "the one non - linear step in our b - spline galaxy - model fitting is the determination of the center of the lensing galaxy ; we describe our centering method further below .",
    "the model - fitting procedure is carried out using the adopted center for the lens galaxy within a suitable subsection of the acs field ( typically @xmath116 ) , along with an error image , a mask specifying cosmic - ray and other zero - weight pixels , and a mask corresponding to stars , neighboring galaxies , and any apparent background - galaxy features .",

    "only even multipole orders are used .",
    "this form of angular dependence is ideal for fitting early - type galaxies : the fit remains linear , the global symmetries seen in early - type galaxies are naturally reflected in the low - order terms , and effects such as isophotal twists , varying ellipticity with radius , and diskiness / boxyness can be captured with minimal effort ( with only the last of these effects requiring multipole orders beyond the quadrupole ) .",
    "we note also that the monopole term can automatically include a fit to the sky background .    following the completion of the initial b - spline model - fitting step ( which for our @xmath130 , 240@xmath131240-pixel images generally takes 23 seconds on a 2.53ghz pentium 4 linux pc ) ,",
    "we examine the residual ( data@xmath8model ) image for faint features not associated with the smooth galaxy model and not initially masked , and perform a second fit with an updated mask , also adding multipole orders as needed .",

    "some of this increase in angular structure with radius is due to our fitting directly to the psf - blurred data .",
    "the centering necessary for the b - spline galaxy fit is accomplished by first fitting with respect to a best - guess center with monopole , dipole , and quadrupole terms .",
    "this fit is then evaluated in a ring and used to determine a flux centroid , which is adopted as a new best - guess center for another iteration of the same procedure . within a few iterations this process  which amounts to minimizing the dipole term",
