    "collective cognition and decision - making in human and animal groups have received significant attention in a broad scientific community  @xcite . extensive research has led to several models for information assimilation in social networks  @xcite .",
    "efficient models for decision - making dynamics of a single individual have also been developed  @xcite .",
    "however , applications like the deployment of a team of human operators that supervises the operation of automata in complex and uncertain environments involve joint evolution of information assimilation and decision dynamics across the group and the possibility of a _ collective intelligence_. a principled approach to modeling and analysis of such _ socio - cognitive networks _ is fundamental to understanding team performance .    in this paper , we focus on the speed - accuracy tradeoff in collective decision - making primarily using the context of problems in which the decision - maker must choose between two alternatives .",
    "the speed - accuracy tradeoff is the fundamental tradeoff between a quick decision and a reliable decision .",
    "the two alternative choice problem is a simplification of many decision - making scenarios and captures the essence of the speed - accuracy tradeoff in a variety of situations encountered by animal groups  @xcite .",
    "moreover , human performance in two alternative choice tasks is extensively studied and well understood  @xcite . in particular , human performance in a two alternative choice task",
    "is modeled well by the _ drift - diffusion model _",
    "( ddm ) and its variants ; variants of the ddm under optimal choice of parameters are equivalent to the ddm .    collective decision - making in human groups is typically studied under two extreme communication regimes : the so - called _ ideal group _ and the _ condorcet group_. in an ideal group , each decision - maker interacts with every other decision - maker and the group arrives at a consensus decision . in a condorcet group , decision - makers",
    "do not interact with one another ; instead a majority rule is employed to reach a decision . in this paper",
    "we study a generalization of the ideal group , namely , _ the ideal network_. in an ideal network , each decision - maker interacts only with a subset of other decision - makers in the group , and the group arrives at a consensus decision .",
    "human decision - making is typically studied in two paradigms , namely , _ interrogation _ , and _",
    "free response_. in the interrogation paradigm , the human has to make a decision at the end of a prescribed time duration , while in the free response paradigm , the human takes his / her time to make a decision . in the model for human decision - making in the interrogation ( free response ) paradigm ,",
    "the decision - maker compares the decision - making evidence against a single threshold ( two thresholds ) and makes a decision . in the context of the free response paradigm ,",
    "the choice of the thresholds dictates the speed - accuracy tradeoff in decision - making .",

    "similarly , the race model in the free response paradigm is a continuum approximation of an asymptotically optimal sequential multiple hypothesis test proposed in  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the collective decision - making problem in human groups is similar to distributed hypothesis testing problems studied in the engineering literature  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "braca  @xcite study distributed implementations of the hypothesis testing problem with fixed sample size as well as the sequential hypothesis testing problem .",

    "algorithm  @xcite to aggregate the test statistic across the network and show that the proposed algorithm achieves the performance of a centralized algorithm asymptotically .",
    "we rely on the laplacian flow  @xcite to aggregate evidence across the network .",
    "our information aggregation model is the continuous time equivalent of the running consensus algorithm with fixed network structure .",
    "in contrast to showing the asymptotic behavior of the running consensus as in  @xcite , we characterize the finite time behavior of our information aggregation model in the free response paradigm .",
    "an additional relevant literature concerns the sensor selection problem in decentralized decision - making . in the context of sequential multiple hypothesis testing with a fusion center",
    ", a sensor selection problem to minimize the expected decision time for a prescribed error rate has been studied in  @xcite . in the present paper , for a prescribed error rate , we characterize the expected decision time as a function of the node centrality .",
    "such a characterization can be used to select a representative node that has the minimum expected decision time , among all nodes , for a prescribed error rate .    in this paper , we begin by studying the speed - accuracy tradeoff in collective decision - making using the context of two alternative choice tasks .",
    "we model the evidence aggregation across the network using the laplacian flow based coupled ddm  @xcite . in order to determine the decision - making performance of each individual in the network ,",
    "we develop a decoupled approximation to the coupled ddm , namely , _ the reduced ddm _ , and characterize its properties .",
    "we extend the coupled ddm to the context of decision - making in two alternative choice tasks with recency effects , i.e. , tasks in which the recently collected evidence weighs more that the evidence collected earlier .",
    "we also extend the coupled ddm to the context of decision - making in multiple alternative choice tasks .",

    "first , we propose a set of reduced ddms , a novel decoupled approximation to the coupled ddm and characterize the efficiency of the approximation .",
    "each reduced ddm comprises two components : ( i ) a centralized component common to each reduced ddm , and ( ii ) a local component that depends on the location of the decision - maker in the network .",
    "second , we present partial differential equations ( pdes ) to determine the expected decision time and the error rate for each reduced ddm .",
    "we also derive high probability bounds on the expected decision time and the error rate for the reduced ddms .",
    "our bounds rely on the first passage time properties of the o - u process .",
    "third , we numerically demonstrate that , for large thresholds , the error rates and the expected decision times for the coupled ddm are approximated well by the corresponding quantities for a centralized ddm with modified thresholds .",
    "we also obtain an expression for threshold modifications ( referred to as threshold corrections ) from our numerical data .",
    "fourth , we examine various threshold selection criteria and analyze the decision - making performance as a function of the decision - maker s location in the network . such an analysis is helpful in selecting representative nodes for high performance in decision - making , e.g. , selecting a node that has the minimum expected decision time , among all nodes , for a prescribed maximum probability of error .",
    "fifth , we extend the coupled ddm to the coupled o - u model and the coupled race model for collective decision - making in two alternative choice tasks with recency effects and multiple alternative choice tasks , respectively .    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we review decision - making models for individual humans and human groups in section  [ sec : models ] .",
    "we present properties of the coupled ddm in section  [ sec : prop - coupled - ddm ] .",
    "we propose the reduced ddm and characterize its performance in the free response decision - making paradigm in section  [ sec : reduced - ddm - free - response ] .",
    "we present some numerical illustrations and results in section  [ sec : numerical ] .",
    "we examine various threshold selection criteria and the effect of the decision - makers s location in the network on their decision - making performance in section  [ sec : threshold - design ] .",

    "our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we survey models for human decision - making .",
    "we present the drift diffusion model ( ddm ) and the coupled ddm that capture individual and network decision - making in a two alternative choice task , respectively .",
    "a two alternative choice task  @xcite is a decision - making scenario in which a decision - maker has to choose between two plausible alternatives . in a two alternative choice task ,",
    "the difference between the log - likelihood of each alternative ( evidence ) is aggregated and the aggregated evidence is compared against thresholds to make a decision .",
    "the evidence aggregation is modeled well by the drift - diffusion process  @xcite defined by @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are , respectively , the drift rate and the diffusion rate , @xmath3 is the standard one - dimensional weiner process , @xmath4 is the aggregate evidence at time @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the initial evidence ( see  @xcite for the details of the model ) .",
    "the two decision hypotheses correspond to the drift rate being positive or negative , i.e. , @xmath7 or @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "human decision - making is studied in two paradigms , namely , _",
    "interrogation _ and _ free - response_. in the interrogation paradigm , a time duration is prescribed to the human who decides on an alternative at the end of this duration . in the model for the interrogation paradigm , by the end of the prescribed duration ,",
    "the human compares the aggregated evidence against a single threshold , and chooses an alternative . in the free response paradigm ,",
    "the human subject is free to take as much time as needed to make a reliable decision . in the model for this paradigm , at each time @xmath9 , the human compares the aggregated evidence against two symmetrically chosen thresholds @xmath10 : ( i ) if @xmath11 , then the human decides in favor of the first alternative ; ( ii ) if @xmath12 , then the human decides in favor of the second alternative ; ( iii ) otherwise , the human collects more evidence .",
    "the ddm in the free response paradigm is the continuum limit of the _ sequential probability ratio test _  @xcite that requires a minimum expected number of observations to decide within a prescribed probability of error .",
    "a decision is said to be _ erroneous _ , if it is in favor of an incorrect alternative . for the ddm and the free response decision - making paradigm , the _ error rate _",
    "is the probability of making an erroneous decision , and the _ decision time _ is the time required to decide on an alternative .",
    "in particular , for @xmath13 , the decision time @xmath14 is defined by @xmath15 and the error rate @xmath16 is defined by @xmath17 . for",
    "the ddm   with thresholds @xmath18 , the expected decision time @xmath19 and the error rate @xmath16 are , respectively , given by  @xcite @xmath20      consider a set of @xmath21 decision - makers performing a two alternative choice task and let their interaction topology be modeled by a connected undirected graph @xmath22 with laplacian matrix @xmath23 .",
    "the evidence aggregation in collective decision - making is modeled in the following way . at each time @xmath24 , every decision - maker @xmath25 ( i ) computes a convex combination of her evidence with her neighbor s evidence ; ( ii ) collects new evidence ; and ( iii ) adds the new evidence to the convex combination .",
    "this collective evidence aggregation process is mathematically described by the following coupled drift diffusion model  @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the vector of aggregate evidence at time @xmath5 , @xmath28 is the standard @xmath21-dimensional vector of weiner processes , @xmath29 is the column @xmath21-vector of all ones , and @xmath30 is the identity matrix of order @xmath21 .",
    "the two decision hypotheses correspond to the drift rate being positive or negative , i.e. , @xmath7 or @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the coupled ddm   captures the interaction among individuals using the laplacian flow dynamics .",
    "the laplacian flow is the continuous time equivalent of the classical degroot model  @xcite , which is a popular model for learning in social networks  @xcite .",
    "however , the social network literature employs the degroot model to reach a consensus on the belief of each individual  @xcite , while the coupled ddm employs the laplacian flow to achieve a consensus on the evidence available to each individual .",
    "the coupled ddm   is the continuous time equivalent of the running consensus algorithm  @xcite with a fixed interaction topology .",
    "the solution to the stochastic differential equation ( sde )   is a gaussian process , and for @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the column @xmath21-vector of all zeros , @xmath33 & = \\beta t \\bs 1_n , \\\\",

    "note that if the diffusion rate is non - unity , then it can be made unity by scaling the drift rate , the initial condition , and thresholds by @xmath40 .",
    "in contrast to the standard ideal group analysis  @xcite that assumes each individual interacts with every other individual , in   each individual interacts only with its neighbors in the interaction graph @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the coupled ddm   generalizes the ideal group model and captures more general interactions , e.g. , organizational hierarchies .",
    "we refer to this decision - making system as an ideal network .",
    "in this section , we study properties of the coupled ddm .",
    "we first present the principal component analysis of the coupled ddm .",
    "we then show that the coupled ddm is an asymptotically optimal decision - making model .",
    "we utilize the principal component analysis to decompose the coupled ddm into a centralized ddm and a coupled error dynamics .",
    "we then develop decoupled approximations of the error dynamics .",
    "in this section , we study the principal components of the coupled ddm .",
    "it follows from   that , for the coupled ddm  , the covariance matrix of the evidence at time @xmath5 is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the eigenvector of the laplacian matrix @xmath43 corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath44 . since @xmath45 it follows that the first principal component of the coupled ddm corresponds to the eigenvector @xmath46 , i.e. , the first principle component is a set of identical ddms , each of which is the average of the individual ddms .",
    "such an averaged ddm , referred to as _ the centralized ddm _",
    ", is described as follows : @xmath47 other principal components correspond to the remaining component @xmath48 of the evidence that we define as the error vector @xmath49 .",

    "[ prop : principal - components ] the coupled ddm   can be decomposed into the centralized ddm   at each node and the error dynamics  . moreover , the centralized ddm is the first principal component of the coupled ddm and the error dynamics correspond to the remaining principal components .",
    "the centralized ddm   is the ddm in which all evidence is available at a fusion center .",
    "it follows from the optimality of the ddm in the free response paradigm that the centralized ddm is also optimal in the free response paradigm .",
    "we will show that the coupled ddm is asymptotically equivalent to the centralized ddm and thus asymptotically optimal .",

    "[ prop : asymptotic - optimality ] , for large thresholds , each node in the coupled ddm behaves like the centralized ddm . in the limit of large thresholds",
