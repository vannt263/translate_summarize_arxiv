    "since the successful detection @xcite of bose - einstein condensates in dilute weakly - interacting bosonic atoms employing magnetic trap at ultra - low temperature , there have been intense theoretical studies on different aspects of the condensate @xcite .",
    "the experimental magnetic trap could be either spherically symmetric or axially symmetric .",
    "the properties of an ideal condensate at zero temperature are usually described by the time - dependent , nonlinear , mean - field gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite which incorporates appropriately the trap potential as well as the interaction between the atoms forming the condensate .",
    "there are many numerical methods for the solution of the gp equation @xcite .",
    "the effect of the interatomic interaction leads to the nonlinear term in the gp equation which complicates the solution procedure .",
    "also , to simulate the proper experimental situation one should be prepared to deal with an axially - symmetric harmonic oscillator trap in addition to a spherically symmetric one @xcite .",
    "a numerical study of the time - dependent gp equation is extremely interesting from a physical point of view , as this can provide solution to many stationary as well as time - evolution problems involving the condensate .",
    "the stationary problems are governed by a wave function with trivial time ( @xmath0 ) dependence @xmath1 , so that @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a real energy parameter .",
    "such problems with trivial time dependence and under the action of a spherically symmetric trap can be treated by time - independent runge - kutta integration method @xcite .",
    "the solution of these problems can also be extracted from the solution of the time - dependent gp equation @xcite . in the presence of an axially - symmetric trap ,",
    "there is a time - independent expansion scheme for the solution of the stationary problem @xcite .",
    "however , for most applications one solves the time - dependent gp equation and extract the stationary wave function @xmath4 and the parametric energy @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "in addition to obtaining the solution of the stationary problem , the time - dependent gp equation can be used to study the intrinsic time - evolution problems with nontrivial time dependence .",
    "there are several methods for the numerical solution of the time - dependent gp equation .",
    "most of them adopt a similar time - iteration procedure in execution , although the details could be different .",
    "the time - dependent gp equation is first discretized in space and time and then solved iteratively with an initial input solution @xcite . in the spherically symmetric case",
    "the gp equation is solved by discretization with the crank - nicholson scheme @xcite for time propagation complimented by the known boundary conditions @xcite . however , in the axially symmetric case a two - step procedure @xcite is first used to separate the radial and axial parts of the hamiltonian before applying the the explicit @xcite or the crank - nicholson scheme @xcite for time propagation in each step . in all these approaches",
    "the nonlinear term is treated together with the explicit or the crank - nicholson scheme @xcite .",
    "it is well known that such a crank - nicholson method may suffer from a possible numerical amplification of random numerical noise , due to nonlinearity , leading to spurious input of kinetic energy and limiting the stability of the algorithm to short time ( small number of iterations ) @xcite .",
    "this also limits the applicability of the method only to small values of the nonlinearity @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we suggest a different split - step time - iteration method for the solution of the time - dependent gp equation where the full hamiltonian is split into three parts @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear as well as the different linear ( nonderivative ) terms ( excluding spatial derivatives ) are treated in one step . in the spherical case the spatial derivative",
    "is treated in another step . in the axially symmetric case",
    "the radial and axial derivatives are dealt with in two separate steps . in the treatment of nonderivative terms the numerical error is kept to a minimum . in dealing with the derivative kinetic energy terms",
    "the gp equation is solved by discretization using the crank - nicholson scheme for time propagation complimented by the known boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the present split - step procedure is that the nonlinear and other linear nonderivative terms can be treated very precisely and this improves the accuracy and the stability of the method compared to previous ones @xcite .",
    "consequently , we could easily find accurate solution of the gp equation for very large nonlinearity , which remains stable even after millions of iterations .",
    "this will be of advantage in using the present approach for the study of time - evolution problems during a large interval of time .    as an application of the present approach in studying time - evolution problems we consider in the spherically symmetric case the following two types of problems : ( 1 ) on a previously formed condensate the harmonic oscillator trapping potential",
    "is increased or decreased suddenly by a factor of two .",
    "this can be achieved in the laboratory by changing the current in the coil responsible for the magnetic field responsible for trapping .",
    "( 2 ) on a previously formed condensate the atomic scattering length is increased or decreased suddenly by a factor of two .",
    "case ( 2 ) above is of interest as recently it has been possible to modify the scattering length in a controlled fashion by exploiting a feshbach resonance @xcite . in both cases we study the resultant oscillation of the root mean square radius of the condensate and its first time derivative . in the axially symmetric case",
    "we also consider the time - evolution problems above and study the resultant oscillation of the root mean square sizes in radial and axial directions .",
    "in section 2 we describe briefly the time - dependent gp equation with spherical and axial traps .",
    "the split - step crank - nicholson method for time propagation is described in section 3 . in sections 4 and 5",
    "we report the numerical results of the present investigation for the spherically and axially symmetric cases , respectively . finally , in sections 6 and 7 we present a discussion and summary of our study .",

    "in this paper we have presented an account of the split - step crank - nicholson method for the solution of the gp equation , where the nonlinear and all nonderivative terms are treated in a separate step essentially exactly via ( [ al1 ] ) . in previous applications",
    "@xcite of the crank - nicholson method to the gp equation these terms were included in the finite - difference scheme for the space derivatives . in the pioneering application of this approach ruprecht",
    "et al @xcite noted that the presence of the nonlinear potential sets a limit to the numerical stability of the method and limits the ability to find the wave function for large nonlinearity .",
    "for the spherically symmetric case , ruprecht et al @xcite produced results for values of nonlinearity @xmath182 upto @xmath183 .",
    "for the axially symmetric case , the maximum of @xmath184 employed by dalfovo and modugno @xcite and by holland and cooper @xcite were 20 and 5 , respectively . using a different method chiofalo et al @xcite produced results for values of @xmath184 upto 6 .",
    "however , unlike in these other methods , in the present method the results remain stable for large @xmath185 ,    at this point we must comment on the potentially powerful split - operator method with a pseudo - spectral scheme for derivatives @xcite , often used in solving nonlinear schrdinger - type equations . in the pseudo - spectral scheme the unknown function is expanded accurately in terms of some known polynomial ( e. g. chebyshev polynomial ) over a set of grid points .",
    "as the number of terms in this expansion increases , the discrete representation of the function and its derivatives becomes increasingly accurate . in the present crank - nicholson method",
    "the space derivative is approximated by a simple three - point finite - difference scheme . to the best of our knowledge",
    "so far there has been no systematic application of the pseudo - spectral method to the solution of the gp equation , specially for the axially symmetric case @xcite . whether the added numerical effort in the pseudo - spectral method is compensated by the increased accuracy",
    "can only be found after a systematic comparison of the two approaches .",
    "this remains a problem of future interest .",
    "in this paper we propose and implement a split - step method for the numerical solution of the time - dependent nonlinear gp equation under the action of a trap with both spherical and cylindrical symmetries by time propagation starting with the initial input solution for the harmonic oscillator problem .",
    "the full hamiltonian is split into the derivative and nonderivative parts . in this fashion",
    "the time propagation with the nonderivative parts can be treated very accurately .",
    "the spatial derivative parts are treated by the crank - nicholson method . in the axially symmetric case",
    "the spatial derivatives in the radial and axial directions are dealt with in two independent steps .",
    "this split - step method leads to highly stable and accurate results .",
    "the final result remains stable for millions of time iteration of the gp equation .",
    "we applied the above method for the numerical study of certain stationary and time - evolution problems with spherical and axial traps . in the spherical case stationary solutions with nonlinearity @xmath186 and 5000 showed accurate result with small numerical error . for a condensate with @xmath134 we studied certain time - evolution problems .",
    "we studied the resulting oscillation of the condensate when at @xmath111 the trap frequency or the scattering length is altered suddenly . in all cases a clean periodic motion of the root mean square radius was noted .    in the axially symmetric case the stationary solutions for @xmath150 with nonlinearity @xmath187 and 300 showed accurate result .",
    "a calculation of the vortex state for @xmath155 with nonlinearity @xmath154 showed equally precise and stable results .",
    "the numerical error was less than one percent in the central region and a couple of percents in the peripheral region .",
    "we also performed two time - evolution studies for @xmath159 when the harmonic oscillator trap is doubled or the scattering length is reduced suddenly .",
    "the root mean square sizes along radial and axial directions showed clean periodic oscillation which is studied in detail .",
    "the present method seems to be very attractive for studying various dynamical evolution problems with dissipative ( imaginary ) interaction , which can not be handled efficiently by other methods such as variational and thomas - fermi methods .",
    "we have already made such an application in the study of chaotic dynamics of the bose - einstein condensate using the gross - pitaevskii equation with dissipative interaction @xcite .",
