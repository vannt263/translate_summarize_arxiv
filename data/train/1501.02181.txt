    "in recent years , many researchers are focused on heavy - ion collision experiments in order to deeply understand the hadronic dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is believed that a transition occurs from hadronic matter to quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase around critical temperature @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , thermal qcd calculations on the properties of hadrons can also be useful in understanding the phase diagram and other properties of strong interactions . in spite of considerable theoretical studies on properties of ( pseudo)scalar and ( axial)vector mesons at finite temperature ( for instance see @xcite ) ,",
    "there are few theoretical studies on the thermal properties of the tensor mesons ( as an example see @xcite ) .    in this article",
    ", we use the thermal qcd sum rule approach to investigate the sensitivity of the masses and decay constants of the light @xmath0 and @xmath1 tensor mesons to temperature ( for the original work see @xcite ) . in the literature , there are also few studies on the vacuum properties of tensor mesons using different models @xcite . the qcd sum rule approach was firstly proposed by shifman , vainshtein and zakharov @xcite in vacuum as one of the most applicable tools to hadron physics .",
    "this method then was extended to finite temperature by bochkarev and shaposhnikov @xcite . in this extension , the wilson expansion and the quark - hadron duality approximation are valid , but the quark and gluon condensates are replaced by their thermal expectation expressions . in thermal qcd sum rule , due to the breaking of the lorentz invariance some extra operators , which are expressed in terms of 4-vector velocity of the medium and the energy - momentum tensor @xcite are appeared in the wilson expansion . taking into account these new operators at finite temperature",
    "we obtain the sum rule for the light tensor mesons under consideration .",
    "in this section our aim is to obtain sum rules for the masses and the decay constants of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 tensor mesons .",
    "for this reason , we start with the following thermal correlation function :    @xmath7{\\rangle}\\mid_{y=0},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 indicates the time ordering operator and @xmath9 is the interpolating current of the tensor mesons .",
    "this current for the mesons under consideration is given by @xmath10,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath11,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the four - derivative with respect to the space - time acting on the left and right , simultaneously .",
    "we will set @xmath13 after applying derivatives with respect to @xmath14 .    to obtain the thermal qcd sum rule for the tensor mesons we need to calculate the correlation function both in qcd and hadronic representations . to get the qcd side we use the operator product expansion ( ope ) to separate the perturbative and non - perturbative contributions .",
    "the perturbative part in spectral representation is written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the spectral density and it is given by the imaginary part of the correlation function , @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "we use the perturbative parts of the light quark propagator to get the spectral density ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "it is obtained as @xmath18 from a similar manner , using the non - perturbative parts of the quark propagator we obtain the non - perturbative contributions as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the fermionic part of the energy momentum tensor and @xmath21 is the four - velocity of the heat bath . according to the general idea of the qcd sum rules , after calculation of also the hadronic side of the correlator we match both the hadronic and ope representations of the correlation function . as a result , we obtain the following sum rule : @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the borel transformation with respect to @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the borel mass parameter and @xmath26 is the temperature - dependent continuum threshold .",
    "it is given as @xmath27 where @xmath28 on the right hand side is the hadronic threshold at zero temperature .",
    "to obtain the values of the masses and decay constants we need to determine the working regions of two auxiliary parameters : the borel mass parameter and the hadronic threshold at zero temperature .",
    "we choose the intervals @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the continuum thresholds in @xmath31 and @xmath32 channels , respectively .",
    "also the working region of the borel mass is taken as @xmath33 . in these intervals ,",
    "the dependence of the results on the auxiliary parameters are relatively weak .    using the working regions of the auxiliary parameters and other input values , we obtain that the masses and decay constants are well described by the following fit functions in terms of temperature : @xmath34 and @xmath35 where the temperature @xmath36 is in units of gev .",
    "the parameters a , b , c , d , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are given in table 1 .",
    "@xmath39    we obtain that the values of the masses and decay constants are stable until temperature @xmath40 @xmath41 , but after this point they start to decrease with altering the temperature ( see @xcite for more details ) . also at deconfinement temperature , the decay constants and masses decrease with amount of @xmath2 and @xmath3 compared to their vacuum values , respectively .",
    "the obtained results of masses and decay constants at zero temperature are @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which are compatible with the vacuum predictions @xcite as well as the existing experimental data @xcite .",
    "our predictions on the temperature behaviors of decay constants and masses can be verified in the future experiments .",
