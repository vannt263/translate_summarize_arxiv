    "as introduced by tabachnikov in @xcite , a tripod configuration for a @xmath0 convex closed curve @xmath1 consists of three perpendicular lines dropped from three points on @xmath1 meeting at a single point and together making angles of @xmath2 .",
    "tabachnikov proved that all @xmath0 closed convex curves have at least two tripod configurations , and later kao and wang @xcite showed the existence and provided a lower bound on the number of tripod configurations as defined for locally convex curves .",
    "below in this section we fix the definitions for tripod configurations of closed curves in the plane to be used later . in section [ pr ]",
    "we present previous results on tripod configurations ; curves are assumed to be @xmath0 and closed unless otherwise specified .",
    "in section [ loca ] we give an improved lower bound over the result in @xcite for the number of tripod configurations possessed by locally convex plane curves . in section [ ttnit ] we generalize the notion of tripod configurations to `` triple normals , '' and show that these `` triple normals '' exist for any @xmath0 closed plane curve .",
    "it follows as a corollary of this result that every @xmath0 closed plane curve ( including immersed curves possibly with self intersections ) has at least one tripod configuration . in sections [ mtintro ] through [ cmt ]",
    "we extend the notion of tripod configurations to the spherical and hyperbolic geometries and show the existence of tripod configurations for convex closed curves sufficiently close to circles .",
    "finally , in section [ poly ] we describe an extension of the notion of tripod configurations for regular polygons .",
    "the consideration of tripod configurations arises from the discussion of the four vertex theorem and related results from tabachnikov @xcite .",
    "tripod configurations are also natural generalizations of two classical notions , the fermat - toricelli point and double normals of closed curves .",
    "the fermat - toricelli point of a triangle is the unique point minimizing the sum of the distances from the three vertices of the triangle to the point ; when no angle of the triangle exceeds @xmath2 , the lines from the triangle vertices to the fermat - toricelli point form angles of @xmath2 ; otherwise , the fermat - toricelli point coincides with a triangle vertex .",
    "thus , the intersection of the three lines of a tripod configuration of convex closed curve @xmath1 is exactly the fermat - toricelli point of the triangle with vertices given by the three points on @xmath1 from which the perpendiculars are dropped .",
    "the study of double normals or diameters , chords of closed curves ( or surfaces ) meeting the curves orthogonally , appears for example in @xcite and @xcite , in which lower bounds and formulae connecting double normals and tangency lines are established .",
    "double normals also arise in the context of curves of constant width ; for instance , see @xcite .",
    "tripod configurations are then an extension to three normals with `` nice '' meeting ( evenly spaced angles of @xmath2 ) from the double normals setting with two coincident normals .",
    "we next consider the following definitions for tripod configurations of @xmath0 closed plane curves .",
    "[ angle ] given a closed plane curve @xmath1 , a _ tripod configuration _ of @xmath1 consists of three lines normal to the curve all coincident at a single point and together forming three angles of @xmath2 .    [ vector ] given a closed plane curve @xmath1 , a _ tripod configuration _ of @xmath1 consists of three lines normal to the curve all coincident at a single point such that the sum of the three unit normal vectors ( oriented according to the curve orientation ) associated to the three normal lines is @xmath3",
    ".    definition [ angle ] is more general than definition [ vector ] ; in figure [ tripod ] , each subfigure is labeled with the definitions it satisfies . in both @xcite and @xcite definition [ angle ]",
    "is the one explicitly stated and motivated as discussed above , while the stronger definition [ vector ] is the one used in the proofs of the theorems . in proving our results below",
    "we will use the original definition [ angle ] .",
    "finally , for convenience , we fix the following definition .",
    "[ tripodpoint ] a _ tripod point _",
    "is the point at which three lines in a tripod configuration intersect .    in particular , a single tripod point may be associated with many , even infinitely many , tripod configurations , as in the case of a circle .",
    "in this section we present the main theorems of @xcite and @xcite , and then list the five results we prove in this paper .",
    "we omit the proof of the lower bound estimate in theorem [ local ] from @xcite , since in theorem [ bound ] we will give a precise count for what is estimated there .",
    "[ convex ] every smooth ( @xmath0 ) closed convex plane curve has at least two tripod configurations .",
    "let @xmath4 be an arc length parametrization of the curve , and let @xmath5 , @xmath6 , the tangent and normal unit vectors to the curve at @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "further let @xmath7 be the angle made by @xmath8 with some fixed direction .",
    "we may also parametrize the curve by @xmath9 , so that @xmath10 are in analogy to the above .",
    "define    @xmath11    let @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the normal and tangent lines to the curve at @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "then the equilateral triangle bounded by the normal lines @xmath15 has area    @xmath16    and the equilateral triangle bounded by the tangent lines @xmath17 has area    @xmath18    thus a tripod configuration is achieved by @xmath15 exactly when @xmath19 , which happens at least twice since @xmath20 is periodic and attains a maximum and minimum .    in the proof above , @xmath17 form an equilateral triangle that circumscribes the curve @xmath1 , and",
    "@xmath9 at which this triangle attains a local maximum or minimum area are such that @xmath15 form tripod configurations of the curve .",
    "the functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 defined in the proof above both have useful geometric interpretations : @xmath21 is the `` support function , '' which for a convex closed curve @xmath1 represents the distance from an origin chosen inside the region enclosed by the curve to the ( unique ) tangent line on @xmath1 in the positive @xmath9 direction , and @xmath22 is the distance from the origin to the normal line to @xmath1 associated with the tangent line of @xmath21 .",
    "the support function @xmath21 may in fact be used to define the original closed convex curve @xmath1 . and using @xmath21 we may easily define curves equidistant to @xmath1-that is , curves of the form @xmath23 , by defining the corresponding support function @xmath24 . from this property",
    "it follows that @xmath1 has the same tripod configurations as its convex equidistant curves ; in fact it is easy to see that this holds regardless of whether the equidistant curves are convex or not , allowing for wavefronts with co - orientation , despite cuspidal singularities .    when @xmath20 is constant , or equivalently when the equilateral triangles circumscribing @xmath1 defined by the tangent lines at @xmath25 have constant area , then by the proof of theorem [ convex ] every line normal to @xmath1 belongs to a tripod configuration of @xmath1 .",
    "properties of these closed curves , called @xmath26-curves , which may be rotated freely inside an equilateral triangle in contact with all its sides , may be found in @xcite .",
    "[ local ] a smooth ( @xmath0 ) closed locally convex plane curve with rotation index @xmath27 has at least @xmath28 tripod configurations .",
    "let @xmath1 be a smooth closed locally convex plane curve with rotation index @xmath27 .",
    "we may parametrize @xmath1 by the angle @xmath9 which @xmath29 makes with a fixed direction for @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 , @xmath32 be as defined in the proof of theorem [ convex ] . define    @xmath33    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "by the same argument as in the proof of theorem [ convex ] , the critical points of the functions @xmath36 correspond to tripod configurations of @xmath1 , and the minimum number of tripod configurations is then twice the number of @xmath36 distinct .",
    "the problem becomes to count the number of distinct classes of such @xmath36 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 given by the relation @xmath37 whenever @xmath38 for some @xmath39 .",
    "see @xcite for the proof of the lower bound @xmath40 on the number of such distinct classes .",
    "we conclude by stating the results we will prove in the remainder of this paper .",
    "the last two theorems require some further definitions which will be discussed in their respective sections .    a smooth ( @xmath0 )",

    "@xmath65 satisfying the desired conditions gives the result .",
    "the case @xmath71 is exactly the case of smooth closed convex plane curves addressed in theorem [ convex ] ; the only function of the form @xmath36 is @xmath72 , and there are at least two tripod configurations .",
    "the lower bound given in theorem [ bound ] is sharp in the case @xmath71 @xcite , but it is unknown whether it is sharp in general .",
    "this improved lower bound also extends to the setting of the existence of tripod configurations for co - orientable wave fronts with total rotation @xmath73 by considering equidistant curves of locally convex curves , as mentioned earlier .",
    "we begin by giving a definition of a generalization of the first isogonic center from classical geometry .",
    "the first isogonic center of a triangle @xmath74 is constructed as follows : take a circle about each of @xmath75 and @xmath76 such that each line segment cuts a chord with angular measure @xmath77 from its corresponding circle , as shown in figure [ firstisogoniccenter ] .",
    "then these circles all intersect at a point @xmath78 , which is called the first isogonic center of @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath79 such that @xmath80 .",
    "then we define the @xmath81centers of @xmath74 as follows :    [ tcenterdef ] a @xmath81center of @xmath74 is constructed by forming circles around each of the chords @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath76 such that these chords cut arcs on the circles of measures @xmath84 , and @xmath85 lying on the same sides of the chords as points @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , respectively , as shown in figure [ abcwitharcs ] .",
    "these circles will intersect at a point , and this point is a @xmath81center of @xmath74 .",
    "note that this point is only unique for fixed orderings of @xmath88 .",
    "we ll now prove that the three circles described above intersect at a single point .",
    "construct three circles such that @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath89 form chords defining arcs of measure @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "suppose the circles with chords @xmath82 and @xmath83 intersect at distinct points @xmath92 and @xmath87 . without loss of generality , we may assume that this intersection occurs in three cases . either @xmath92 is closer to the chord @xmath89 than @xmath87",
    ", @xmath92 is the same point as @xmath87 , or @xmath92 is farther away from @xmath89 than @xmath87 .    by hypothesis",
    ", @xmath92 lies on the circles about @xmath82 and @xmath83 , as one of their points of intersection .",
    "notice that @xmath93 , since :    @xmath94    therefore @xmath92 also lies on the circle about @xmath89 .",
    "we need to recall a few more definitions before proving the central property of @xmath81centers .    given a triangle @xmath95 and a point @xmath92 , _",
    "the triangle antipedal to _ @xmath74 _ with respect to _ @xmath92 is the triangle with sides lying on the lines normal to @xmath96 and @xmath97 through the points @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively .",

    "we now state and prove a key property of these generalized first isogonic centers :    [ antipedalprop ] given @xmath104 and @xmath74 , any @xmath105 of maximal area and circumscribing @xmath74 is the antipedal triangle to @xmath74 with respect to some @xmath81center , where @xmath106 are the angles of the vertices of @xmath102 .",
    "let @xmath106 be the angles of the vertices of the triangles in @xmath107 , enumerated clockwise ; we may assume @xmath108 is oriented relative @xmath74 as in figure [ defandabc ] , relabeling vertices if necessary .",

    "@xmath113 sufficiently close to @xmath114 on the arc @xmath115 , we may define @xmath116 to be the intersection point of line @xmath117 and arc @xmath118 distinct from @xmath87 , and define @xmath119 analogously with line @xmath120 and arc @xmath121 .",
    "then @xmath122 , and @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 .",
    "by hypothesis the length @xmath126 should be maximized when @xmath127 .",
    "define @xmath128 and @xmath129 to be the shortest lines from @xmath109 and @xmath111 to the line segment @xmath130 , respectively ; @xmath128 perpendicularly bisects @xmath131 and @xmath129 perpendicularly bisects @xmath132 .",
    "so the length of @xmath130 is twice the length of @xmath133 , and @xmath133 is maximal when it is parallel to @xmath134 , thus perpendicular to @xmath135 .",
    "therefore @xmath136 is perpendicular to @xmath135 .",
    "repeating this argument on all three sides of the triangle shows that @xmath102 is antipedal to @xmath74 with respect to @xmath92 .",
    "we are now ready to state and prove the main theorem of this section .",
    "[ tnit ] given a smooth ( @xmath0 ) closed plane curve @xmath1 and three angles @xmath43 , such that @xmath44 and @xmath45 , there exist three normals to @xmath1 intersecting at a single point and forming angles @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "define @xmath137 and @xmath138 , and choose @xmath104 such that the angles of the vertices of the triangles in @xmath107 are @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 respectively . because the curve @xmath1 is @xmath0 smooth , there exists a triangle @xmath108 of maximal area circumscribing @xmath1 , and there",
    "exist distinct points @xmath142 lying in the intersections of @xmath1 and @xmath143 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath102 is also a triangle of maximal area in @xmath107 circumscribing @xmath74 .",
    "indeed , any triangle in the class @xmath107 circumscribing @xmath74 is contained inside ( and no larger than ) a triangle circumscribing @xmath1 by moving the sides `` outward '' one by one .    since @xmath108 is the triangle of maximal area circumscribing @xmath74 , it is antipedal to @xmath74 by proposition [ antipedalprop ] .",
    "so the three normal lines to @xmath1 at @xmath142 , all intersect at a point , forming the required angles .",
    "setting @xmath144 in theorem [ tnit ] above gives us the following result .",
    "[ pln ] a smooth ( @xmath0 ) closed plane curve has at least one tripod configuration .",
    "in particular , immersed plane curves with self intersection also possess at least one tripod configuration .",
    "we now extend our definition of tripod configurations to the spherical and hyperbolic geometries and again consider the question of which types of curves posess tripod configurations .",
    "our strategy is to take a general curve and define a parameter space ( a manifold with boundary ) with a function defined on it ; the pair is constructed so that the critical points of this function correspond to tripod configurations of the original curve .",
    "using morse theory for manifolds with boundary @xcite , we then bound from below the number of critical points this function must possess on this parameter space , thus giving a lower bound the number of tripod configurations of a curve .",
    "below , we define a natural extension of tripod configurations to general geometries , state our main results , and review the necessary morse theory for the following two sections .    given a @xmath0 closed curve @xmath1 , a tripod configuration of @xmath1 consists of three geodesics normal to the curve , all coincident at a single point and pairwise making angles of @xmath2 .",
    "this is our original definition with geodesics replacing straight lines .",
    "we now state the following main result to be proven in sections [ mtintro ] through [ cmt ] .",
    "[ sphyp ] every smooth ( @xmath0 ) closed curve sufficiently close to a circle ( excluding great circles on the sphere ) in the spherical or hyperbolic geometry has at least two tripod configurations .    by sufficiently close to a circle we mean that the maximal diameter of the curve s evolute must be small in comparison to the minimal diameter of the curve",
    "we exclude the case of curves close to a great circle in the spherical geometry since the necessary computations in section [ cmi ] are restricted points lying in a single hemisphere .",
    "this qualitative result gives the existence of a neighborhood around the circle in which smooth perturbations all contain 2 tripod configurations .",
    "we now introduce our parameter space and scalar function .    given a smooth closed curve @xmath1 in a smooth @xmath145-dimensional manifold , let @xmath146 be the region enclosed by @xmath1 and @xmath147 be a parallel curve to @xmath1 of constant distance @xmath148 away ( in the `` outward '' direction , not in @xmath146 ) .",
    "then the _ tripod configuration space of _ @xmath1 is @xmath149 .    in what follows we use the coordinates , @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 , to discuss points in @xmath153 .",
    "the region @xmath146 includes its boundary , and since @xmath1 is a smooth curve , @xmath153 is a smooth manifold .    _",
    "the tripod functional _ of a curve , @xmath1 , is the function , @xmath154 defined by @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the distance function on the ambient manifold .",
    "note that @xmath157 is a smooth function except possibly where @xmath158 or @xmath159 coincides with @xmath32 .",
    "but since the region @xmath146 is contained properly within @xmath147 , these points do not exist in our domain , and thus @xmath157 is smooth . for generic curves ,",
    "this functional is morse , i.e. has a non - singular hessian .",
    "below we establish that certain equivalence classes of its critical points from the interior of @xmath153 correspond to the tripod configurations of @xmath1 .",
    "[ critprop ] let @xmath160 be the set of interior critical points of @xmath157 , and let @xmath161 if @xmath162 for some permutation on three objects @xmath163 .",

    "the functional @xmath157 has an interior critical point at @xmath165 precisely when @xmath166 at that point , which implies :    @xmath167    so @xmath168 and @xmath169 are critical points of the function @xmath170 .",
    "thus , the ( arc length minimizing ) geodesic segments @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 are orthogonal to the curve @xmath1 , and pairwise form angles of @xmath2 .",

    "the critical points described above detect tripod configurations with tripod points _ inside _ the curve only ; tripod configurations as in figure [ def3 ] with tripod points occuring outside of the curve will not be counted .",
    "morse theory for a functional @xmath157 on a manifold @xmath181 with boundary is concerned with the critical points of @xmath157 in the interior of @xmath181 and the critical points of @xmath157 when restricted to @xmath182 .",

    "the first situation corresponds to tripod configurations of @xmath1 as discussed in proposition [ critprop ] . using the notation of laudenbach @xcite ,",
    "the last two situations correspond to dirichlet or @xmath114 type critical points , and neumann or @xmath186 type critical points , respectively ; a critical point is said to be type @xmath114 if the gradient vector points orthogonally outward along the boundary , and type @xmath186 if the gradient vector points orthogonally inward along the boundary .",

    "we make this choice since our configuration space may possess infinitely many type @xmath186 critical points along the boundary . indeed , in figure [ densesubmanifold ] , when @xmath207 and @xmath208 is the closest point in @xmath146 to @xmath207 , then the direction of greatest increase for @xmath209 is directly into @xmath146 , normal to @xmath1 .",
    "so @xmath165 is a type @xmath186 critical point , and @xmath210 is a submanifold of type @xmath186 critical points .",
    "our goal in this section is to describe when type @xmath114 critical points occur for the functional @xmath211 . recall the notation fixed in the previous section .",
    "the functional @xmath157 has a boundary critical point of type @xmath114 at @xmath212 if and only if the gradient vector of @xmath157 points orthogonally outward along the boundary of @xmath213 .",
    "equivalently , this requires that line segments @xmath214 are orthogonal to @xmath147 ( and thus @xmath1 ) , that @xmath208 lies on @xmath1 , and that the vector @xmath215 in the @xmath145-dimensional space containing @xmath1 is normal @xmath1 , pointing outwards .",
    "we therefore consider the possible numbers of distinct lines normal to @xmath147 all passing through a single point @xmath32 on @xmath1 .    as discussed earlier , we assume in sections [ mtintro ] through [ cmt ] that @xmath1 is sufficiently close to a circle , so that in particular @xmath1 encloses its evolute .",
    "we will next see that this is sufficient to ensure that there are at most two distinct lines normal to @xmath147 passing through a single point on @xmath1 .",
    "first , recall that the evolute of a smooth curve is the envelope of its normal lines ; in particular , the evolute of a circle degenerates to a single point , its center .",
    "let @xmath1 be a smooth closed curve sufficiently close to a circle , so that its evolute lies strictly inside @xmath1 .",
    "fix @xmath216 ; then for every point of @xmath1 there exist exactly two lines passing through it which are also normal to @xmath147 .",
    "in general , given a fixed curve in a @xmath145-dimensional space , we may define a function on the space by mapping each point in the space to the number of distinct lines normal to the curve passing through that point .",
    "this number is constant for points in the connected components of the complement of the evolute of the curve ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "now @xmath1 is obtained from a circle by a sufficiently small deformation so that the common evolute of @xmath1 and @xmath147 does not intersect @xmath1 , so that @xmath1 and @xmath147 lie in the same connected component of the complement of the evolute .",
    "thus the number of lines normal to @xmath147 passing through a point on @xmath1 is always two .",
    "we therefore see that if @xmath212 is a type @xmath114 critical point of @xmath157 , then with @xmath208 fixed , each of @xmath217 are one of exactly two points on @xmath147 whose line segments connecting them to @xmath208 are normal to @xmath1 .",

    "we know that there exists a single tripod configuration for an equilateral triangle corresponding to its fermat - toricelli point .",

    "we consider candidate `` isoceles '' tripod configurations : we choose three vertices of @xmath296 that make an isoceles triangle , find its fermat - toricelli point , and check whether the three lines passing through it and one of the three chosen vertices form a tripod configuration of @xmath296 by determining whether support line condition is satisfied . by symmetry",
    "it suffices to consider the isoceles triangles with vertices @xmath298 and fermat - toricelli point @xmath92",

    "if @xmath304 or @xmath305 , then only @xmath308 satisfies this condition ; if @xmath306 , then only @xmath309 satisfies this condition .      as for tripod configurations for smooth curves , the support lines corresponding to the lines forming a tripod configuration of a regular polygon @xmath296 form an equilateral triangle ; any tripod configuration of a polygon corresponding to vertices @xmath310 is associated to an equilateral triangle enclosing @xmath296 and meeting it at the three vertices .",
    "we may count the configurations of `` circumscribing '' equilateral triangles about @xmath296 . by symmetry it suffices to count the number of such triangles passing through a particular point ,",
    "say @xmath169 , when the vertices of regular @xmath27-polygon @xmath296 are labeled cyclically as before , and we may further suppose that the angle made by the side of the circumscribing equilateral triangle passing through vertex @xmath169 measures less than @xmath311 .",
    "we again consider the three cases @xmath304 , @xmath305 , @xmath306 separately .",
    "for @xmath304 , begin with the equilateral triangle circumscribed about @xmath296 with sides which are segments on lines @xmath312 passing through vertices @xmath313 respectively .",
    "rotating @xmath314 about @xmath169 towards @xmath315 decreases the angle between @xmath314 and @xmath315 by the same amount that the angles between @xmath316 and @xmath317 as well as @xmath318 and @xmath319 decrease as @xmath316 and @xmath318 are rotated about @xmath320 and @xmath321 , respectively , to ensure that the triangle defined by @xmath290 remains equilateral . continuing to rotate @xmath290 in this manner",
    ", we will find no new circumscribing configurations ( up to rotational symmetry ) will be produced once @xmath322 lies on @xmath314 .",
    "so the only tripod configuration for @xmath296 when @xmath304 is the one associated with the triple described above : @xmath313 and its rotated analogues .",
    "next we consider the case @xmath305 .",
    "from before we know there exists a circumscribing equilateral triangle about @xmath296 with sides lying on lines @xmath312 passing through vertices @xmath323 respectively .",
    "we again consider all possible circumscribing equilateral triangles by rotating @xmath312 , with @xmath314 rotated about @xmath169 to decrease its angle with @xmath324 and @xmath316 , @xmath318 rotated in the same direction and possibly translated in order that the equilateral triangle defined by @xmath312 continues to circumscribe @xmath296 . at any point of the rotation of @xmath314 towards @xmath324",
    ", @xmath316 will be rotating about @xmath320 or @xmath325 , and @xmath318 will be rotating about @xmath326 or @xmath327 .",
    "so we only need to check whether any of the three vertex triples @xmath328 , @xmath329 , and @xmath330 are associated with tripod configurations .",
    "after rotation we see that @xmath329 is equivalent to @xmath331 , while @xmath330 is a distinct isoceles configuration ; the previous section showed that this is not associated with a tripod configuration .",
    "it remains to consider @xmath328 .",
    "this occurs only if the acute angle between @xmath316 and @xmath332 is smaller than the acute angle between @xmath316 and @xmath333 .",
    "but it is easily computed that the two angles ( in order ) measure in degrees @xmath334 so the last case is also not associated with a tripod configuration , and the only tripod configurations are the ones associated with the triple @xmath323 and its rotated analogues .    finally we consider the case @xmath306 .",
    "the argument goes as before , and we then need to consider the following triples : @xmath330 , @xmath335 , @xmath336 . now @xmath330 is equivalent to by symmetry to @xmath329 , and @xmath336 corresponds to another isoceles case known not to be associated with a tripod configuration .",
    "finally we consider @xmath335 ; if this triple were admissible , then the acute angle between @xmath316 and @xmath332 would be larger than the acute angle between @xmath316 and @xmath337 .",
    "but in order , the two angles measure ( in degrees ) @xmath338 so the last case also does not correspond to a tripod configuration .",
    "we conclude that for all regular polygons @xmath296 , the tripod configurations described above are the only tripod configurations of @xmath296 , with the exact counts arising from rotational symmetry .",
