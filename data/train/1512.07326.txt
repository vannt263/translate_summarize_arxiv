    "since epidemic models were first introduced by kermack and mckendrick in @xcite , the study on mathematical models has been flourished .",
    "much attention has been devoted to analyzing , predicting the spread , and designing controls of infectious diseases in host populations ; see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "one of classic epidemic models is the sir ( susceptible - infected - removed ) model that is suitable for modeling some diseases with permanent immunity such as rubella , whooping cough , measles , smallpox , etc . in the sir model ,",
    "a homogeneous host population is subdivided into three epidemiologically distinct types of individuals :    * ( s ) : the susceptible class , the class of those individuals who are capable of contracting the disease and becoming infective , * ( i ) : the infective class , the class of those individuals who are capable of transmitting the disease to others , * ( r ) : the removed class , the class of infected individuals who are dead , or have recovered , and are permanently immune , or are isolated .",
    "if we denote by @xmath0 the number of individuals at time @xmath1 in classes ( s ) , ( i ) , and ( r ) , respectively , the spread of infection can be formulated by the following deterministic system of differential equations : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the per capita birth rate of the population , @xmath4 is the per capita disease - free death rate and @xmath5 is the excess per capita death rate of infective class , @xmath6 is the effective per capita contact rate , and @xmath7 is per capita recovery rate of the infective individuals . on the other hand",
    ", it is well recognized that the population is always subject to random disturbances and it is desirable to learn how randomness effects the models .",
    "thus , it is important to investigate stochastic epidemic models .",
    "jiang et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the asymptotic behavior of global positive solution for the non - degenerate stochastic sir model @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are mutually independent brownian motions , @xmath12 are the intensities of the white noises . however , in reality , the classes ( s ) , ( i ) , and ( r ) are usually subject to the same random factors such as temperature , humidity , pollution and other extrinsic influences . as a result , it is more plausible to assume that the random noise perturbing the three classes is correlated .",
    "if we assume that the brownian motions @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the same , we obtain the following model @xmath13 which has been considered in @xcite . compared to , is more difficult to deal with due to the degeneracy of the diffusion .",
    "one of the important questions is concerned with whether the transition to a disease free state or the disease state will survive permanently . for the deterministic model ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior has been classified completely as follows .",
    "if @xmath14 , then the population tends to the disease - free equilibrium @xmath15 while the population approaches an endemic equilibrium in case @xmath16 . in @xcite , similar results are given for a general epidemic model with reaction - diffusion in terms of basic reproduction numbers .",
    "in @xcite , the authors attempted to answer the aforementioned question for in case @xmath17 and @xmath18 . by using lyapunov - type functions",
    ", they provided some sufficient conditions for extinction or permanence as well as ergordicity for the solution of system . using the same methods , the extinction and permanence in some different stochastic sir models",
    "have been studied in @xcite etc . in practice , because of the randomness and the degeneracy of the diffusion , the model is much more difficult to deal with compared in contrast to the deterministic counter part . moreover , although one may assume the existence of appropriate lyapunov function , it is fairly difficult to find an effective lyapunov function in practice .",
    "in other words , there has been no decisive classification for stochastic sir models that is similar to the deterministic case .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to provide such a classification .",
    "we shall derive a sufficient and almost necessary condition for permanence ( as well as ergodicity ) and extinction of the disease for the stochastic sir model by using a value @xmath19 , which is similar to @xmath20 in the deterministic model . note that such kind of results are obtained for a stochastic sis model in @xcite .",
    "however , the model studied there can be reduced to one - dimensional equation that is much easier to investigate .",
    "the method used in @xcite can not treat the stochastic sir model .",
    "estimation for the convergence rate is also not given in @xcite .",
    "a more general method therefore need to be introduced .",
    "the new method can remove most assumptions in @xcite as well as can treat the case @xmath21 , which has not been taken into consideration in @xcite . note that the case @xmath17 and @xmath22 indicates the random factors have opposite effects to healthy individuals and infected ones .",
    "for instance , patients with tuberculosis or some other pulmonary disease do not endure well in cool and humid weather while healthy people may be fine in such kind of weather .",
    "in addition , individuals with a disease , usually have weaker resistance to some other kinds of disease .",
    "our new method is also suitable to deal with other stochastic variants of such as models introduced in @xcite , etc .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "section [ sec : thr ] derives a threshold that is used to classify the extinction and permanence of the disease . to establish the desired result , by considering the dynamics on the boundary , we obtain a threshold @xmath19 that enables us to determine the asymptotic behavior of the solution .",
    "in particular , it is shown that if @xmath23 the disease will decay in an exponential rate . in case @xmath24",
    ", the solution converges to a stationary distribution in total variation .",
    "it means that the disease is permanent .",
    "the rate of convergence is proved to be bounded above by any polynomial decay .",
    "the ergodicity of the solution process is also proved .",
