    "high energy partons propagating through matter are predicted to lose energy via induced gluon radiation , with the magnitude of the energy loss depending linearly on the color charge density of the matter@xcite .",
    "this phenomenon may provide a sensitive probe of the medium generated in high energy heavy ion collisions , where a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is expected to form if sufficiently high energy density is achieved .",
    "the high energy partons in such collisions result from the hard scattering of quarks or gluons from the incoming nuclei and are observed experimentally as correlated `` jets '' of hadrons having large transverse momentum ( ) with respect to the beam direction .",
    "the experimental challenge is to measure partonic energy loss ( `` jet quenching '' ) in the extremely complex environment of high energy nuclear collisions .    in these talks we discuss recent progress towards the measurement of jet quenching in high energy nuclear collisions by the star experiment at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory . at the values of jet  accessible at rhic energies with the currently achieved integrated luminosities ,",
    "full jet reconstruction with good energy resolution is difficult .",
    "we therefore utilize known features of jet fragmentation to study jet quenching , in particular the inclusive spectrum of high  ( `` leading '' ) hadrons and the angular correlation of pairs of high  hadrons .",
    "we compare their distributions in centrality - selected au+au collisions to those in d+au and non - singly diffractive ( nsd ) p+p collisions , all at = 200 gev . unless otherwise specified , the results reported here are for unidentified charged hadrons , measured in the large cylindrical star time projection chamber with a 0.5 t solenoidal magnetic field@xcite . related results from star are discussed in @xcite .",
    "jets occasionally fragment with a single hadron carrying a large fraction of the total jet energy .",
    "the resulting inclusive hadron distributions exhibit power - law ( @xmath0 ) shapes characteristic of the underlying perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) processes .",

    "the centrality bins correspond to the indicated percentiles of the total cross section : 0 - 5% for au+au indicates the most central and 60 - 80% the most peripheral collisions .",
    "power - law shapes are clearly observed in all cases .",
    "nuclear effects on hadron production in d+au and au+au collisions are measured through comparison to the p+p reference spectrum using the ratio @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the differential yield per event in the nuclear collision @xmath3 , =/  describes the nuclear geometry , and @xmath4 for p+p inelastic collisions is determined from the p+p measurement .",

    "the error bars indicate the statistical and systematic uncertainties of the spectra , while the bands indicate the uncertainty due to the geometrical scaling factor . at the highest ,",
    "hadron suppression of approximately a factor 5 is observed for the most central collisions : inclusive hadron production is strongly suppressed at high  in central au+au collisions . for the most peripheral collisions",
    "is consistent with unity , while intermediate centralities interpolate smoothly between the extremes .",
    "figure [ raarcp ] , right panel , shows the related quantity , the -scaled ratio of particle yields in central relative to peripheral collisions , which also exhibits large suppression of inclusive hadron production in central collisions .",
    "figure [ raarcp ] also shows the results of three theoretical calculations : two models based on pqcd incorporating shadowing , the cronin effect and jet quenching in dense matter ( pqcd - i@xcite , pqcd - ii@xcite ) , and a model incorporating gluon saturation in the incoming au nuclei@xcite .",
    "the pqcd - based calculations contain one free parameter , the energy density for central collisions , which is fit to the data , yielding an initial density 30 - 50 times that of cold nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "these calculations then successfully describe the  and centrality dependence of the inclusive suppression for 5 gev / c .",
    "the saturation model also describes the suppression and its -dependence for the 0 - 5%/40 - 60% ratio for 5 gev / c .",

    "the p+p correlations are scaled up to the same pedestal value at @xmath11 as au+au and superposed with a @xmath12 term that characterizes the azimuthal anisotropy in non - central au+au collisions ( elliptic flow @xcite ) .",
    "the magnitude of this additional correlation is measured independently and is given by the second coefficient of a fourier expansion of the azimuthal distribution relative to the orientation of the reaction plane of the event , for particles having 2 gev / c @xcite .",
    "figure [ c2auau ] shows that the correlation strength at small relative angle ( @xmath13 ) in peripheral and central au+au and at large relative angle ( @xmath14 ) in peripheral au+au are very similar to the scaled correlations in p+p collisions .",

    "these observations , together with the strong suppression of inclusive production and large elliptic flow at high @xcite , suggest a picture in which jets traversing the bulk of the medium produced in au+au collisions are absorbed ( strong jet quenching ) , and the observed jets are biased towards those generated on the surface and heading outwards .",
    "however , other explanations , in particular the gluon saturation picture , may also account for some or all of the observed phenomena .",
    "experimentally , these very different scenarios can be discriminated through measurements of d+au collisions , where initial state effects in the au nucleus remain but no final state dense medium is generated .",
    "pqcd - based models predict an enhancement in the production of high - charged hadrons in d+au collisions relative to binary - scaled p+p collisions and little change in the back - to - back correlation strength@xcite , while one version of the saturation model@xcite predicts an inclusive suppression in d+au of about 30% and possibly also suppression of the back - to - back strength due to a mono - jet contribution @xcite .",
    "figure [ dau ] shows ( left ) and the pedestal subtracted two - particle azimuthal distributions ( right ) measured by star in minimum bias and central d+au collisions@xcite .  exceeds unity for 27 gev / c , consistent with expectations from the cronin effect .",

    "the azimuthal distributions are characterized by a fit to the sum of near - side and back - to - back gaussian peaks plus a constant .",
