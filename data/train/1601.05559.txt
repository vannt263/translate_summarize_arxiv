    "* magnetic skyrmion transistor driven by a microwave field . * [ se : microwave - driving ] first , we study the magnetic skyrmion transistor driven by a microwave field under the framework of micromagnetics ( see methods for the modeling details ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the magnetic skyrmion transistor is basically constructed by a nanotrack with the size of @xmath0 nm @xmath1 nm @xmath2 nm , which has a pma value of @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 mj m@xmath6 and a dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi ) constant of @xmath7 mj m@xmath8 .",
    "the magnetic nanotrack is sandwiched between the voltage gate electrode and the heavy - metal substrate , where the a voltage - gated region is between @xmath9 nm and @xmath10 nm .",
    "the pma value within the voltage - gated region @xmath11 can be adjusted by applying an electric field @xmath12 based on the relationship of @xmath13  @xcite , where the transition regions between @xmath3 and @xmath11 span 10 nm .",
    "the regions in the nanotrack at the left and right sides of the voltage - gated region are referred to as the source and drain sides , respectively .",
    "a microwave antenna is deployed at the left end of the nanotrack ( @xmath14 nm @xmath15 @xmath16 nm ) , which can generate a sinusoidal microwave magnetic field @xmath17 along the @xmath18-direction , where @xmath19 is the microwave amplitude and @xmath20 is the microwave frequency . the magnetic nanotrack is almost magnetized along @xmath21-direction in our setup .",
    "a magnetic skyrmion is created and relaxed at the source side of the nanotrack ( @xmath22 nm ) by a skyrmion injector which can be fabricated by placing a magnetic tunnel junction ( mtj ) upon the source side of the nanotrack  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates the initial , on and off states of the magnetic skyrmion transistor . at the initial state ,",
    "both the microwave antenna and the voltage gate are turned off , the magnetic skyrmion remains in its position on the source side at @xmath22 nm . at the on state , the antenna is turned on ( @xmath23 mt , @xmath24 ghz ) but the voltage gate is turned off . the microwave field pulse applied at the left end of the nanotrack excites spin waves propagating toward the drain side of the nanotrack , driving the magnetic skyrmion into motion .",
    "the moving skyrmion passes the voltage - gated region and reaches the drain side of the nanotrack at @xmath25 ns , which can be detected by the skyrmion reader at the drain side  @xcite . at the off state ,",
    "both the microwave antenna and the voltage gate are turned on .",
    "the spin waves excited by the microwave field drive the magnetic skyrmion moving towards the right . on the other hand ,",
    "the gate voltage , which results in the change of the pma value @xmath11 in the voltage - gated region , leads to the stop of skyrmion when it approaches the gate - induced potential barrier .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , when the pma value in the voltage - gated region is larger than that of the intrinsic value , i.e. @xmath26 , the skyrmion stops at the potential barrier at the boundary between the source side and the voltage - gated region .",
    "when the pma value in the voltage - gated region is smaller than that of the intrinsic value , i.e. @xmath27 , the skyrmion stops at the potential barrier at the boundary between the voltage - gated region and the drain side . for both off states , the skyrmion reaches the equilibrium state within @xmath28 ns under the driving force from the microwave - induced spin waves and the repulsive force from the potential barrier .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the trajectories of the skyrmion motion in the magnetic skyrmion transistor driven by the microwave - induced spin waves at the on and off states with different amplitudes ( @xmath23 mt or @xmath29 mt , @xmath30 ghz ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , the magnetic skyrmion transistor is in the on state , where the microwave antenna is turned on and the voltage gate is turned off .",
    "the pma value in the voltage - gated region equals that of the intrinsic value , i.e. @xmath31 . the skyrmion moves from the source side to the drain side within @xmath32 ns .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the transverse motion of the skyrmion in the @xmath18-direction is caused by the skyrmion hall effect  @xcite . due to the decay of the microwave - induced spin waves and the repulsion from the edge at the right end of the nanotrack",
    ", the magnetic skyrmion is finally relaxed at the drain side at @xmath33 ns .",
    "when the magnetic skyrmion transistor is in the off state , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , where the microwave antenna and the voltage are turned on , the pma value in the voltage - gated is larger than that of the intrinsic value , i.e. @xmath34 . the magnetic skyrmion driven by the microwave - induced spin waves moves toward the drain side .",
    "however , the magnetic skyrmion can not surmount the potential barrier at the boundary between the source side with lower pma and the voltage - gated region with higher pma .",
    "it can be seen that the center of the magnetic skyrmion can enter the voltage - gated region for a short time driven by the strong excited spin wave emitted from the microwave antenna .",
    "nevertheless , the magnetic skyrmion is repelled by the potential barrier .",
    "the combined effects of the driving force supplied from the microwave antenna , the repulsive force provided by the voltage gate and the magnus force exerted on the magnetic skyrmion lead to the motion of the magnetic skyrmion in a spiral trajectory .",
    "the skyrmion eventually reaches equilibrium and stops near the boundary between the source side and the voltage - gated region .",
    "figure  [ fig2]c shows the other off state , where the microwave antenna and the voltage are turned on , the pma value in the voltage - gated is smaller than that of the intrinsic value , i.e. @xmath35 . the magnetic skyrmion driven by the microwave - induced spin waves moves toward the drain side .",
    "in contrast to the off state shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , the magnetic skyrmion passes the boundary between the source side with higher pma and the voltage - gated region with lower pma , where a potential well is induced .",
    "however , the magnetic skyrmion can not penetrate the potential barrier at the boundary between the voltage - gated region with lower pma and the drain side with higher pma .",
    "similar to the off state shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , the magnetic skyrmion shows a spiral trajectory of motion , and finally stops near the boundary between the voltage - gated region and the drain side . in three cases ,",
    "the frequency of the microwave is fixed at @xmath30 ghz , while two amplitudes of @xmath36 mt and @xmath37 mt are applied , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that the transverse shift of the skyrmion in the @xmath18-direction increases with the amplitude of the microwave . indeed , the speed of the skyrmion increases with the amplitude of the microwave .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the trajectories of the skyrmion in the magnetic skyrmion transistor at the on and off states driven by the microwave - induced spin waves with different frequencies ( @xmath23 mt , @xmath30 ghz or @xmath38 ghz ) .",
    "figure  [ fig3]a shows the on state , where the microwave antenna is turned on and the voltage gate is turned off .",
    "the pma value in the voltage - gated region equals that of the intrinsic value , i.e. @xmath31 .",
    "figure  [ fig3]b shows the off state , where the microwave antenna and the voltage are turned on , the pma value in the voltage - gated is larger than that of the intrinsic value , i.e. @xmath34 or @xmath39 .",
    "figure  [ fig3]c shows the other off state , where the microwave antenna and the voltage are turned on , the pma value in the voltage - gated is smaller than that of the intrinsic value , i.e. @xmath35 . in three cases ,",
    "the amplitude of the microwave is fixed at @xmath36 mt , while two frequencies of @xmath24 ghz and @xmath40 ghz are applied , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that in fig .",
    "[ fig3]c , we set @xmath26 for the case of @xmath24 ghz , while @xmath41 for the case of @xmath40 ghz , in order to ensure the off state .",
    "it can be seen that the transverse shift of the skyrmion in the @xmath18-direction increases with the frequency of the microwave . indeed , the speed of the skyrmion increases with the frequency of the microwave .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the working windows of the magnetic skyrmion transistor driven and controlled by the microwave antenna and the voltage gate . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a , the excitation field amplitude of the microwave antenna is fixed at @xmath23 mt , while the excitation field frequency of the microwave antenna is varied in the range between @xmath42 ghz and @xmath43 ghz . obviously , when the voltage gate is turned off , i.e. @xmath31 , the magnetic skyrmion transistor is always in the on state , where the magnetic skyrmion moves from the source side to the drain side in a certain time .",
    "when the voltage gate is turned on , which adjusts the @xmath11 to be in the range of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the magnetic skyrmion transistor is still in the on state , as the gate - induced potential barrier is not strong enough to stop the magnetic skyrmion from passing through . when the @xmath11 is further increased to be larger than @xmath46 or decreased to be smaller than @xmath47 , the working state of the magnetic skyrmion transistor switches to the off state at @xmath42 ghz .",
    "however , it can be seen that when @xmath20 increases to @xmath38 ghz , the magnetic skyrmion under stronger driving force provided by the microwave antenna can overcome the potential barrier induced by the voltage gate in the range of @xmath48 and @xmath49 . because the potential barrier at the boundary between the source side with lower pma and the voltage - gated region with higher pma is closer to the antenna than the one at the boundary between the voltage - gated region with lower pma and the drain side with higher pma , the skyrmion experiences stronger driving force when it is approaching the former potential barrier .",
    "thus , the potential barrier at the boundary between the source side with lower pma and the voltage - gated region with higher pma is easier to be penetrated by the magnetic skyrmion at the same @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "similar results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b , where the excitation field frequency of the microwave antenna is fixed at @xmath24 ghz , while the excitation field amplitude of the microwave antenna is varied in the range between @xmath50 mt and @xmath37 mt .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the working windows of the magnetic skyrmion transistor at different dmi constants and microwave antenna parameters with a fixed voltage gate - induced pma value @xmath11 .",
    "figure  [ fig5]a , b show the working state of the magnetic skyrmion transistor at @xmath51 as functions of the dmi constant @xmath52 and antenna frequency @xmath20 , and as functions of dmi constant @xmath52 and antenna amplitude @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig5]c , d show the working state of the magnetic skyrmion transistor at @xmath53 as functions of the dmi constant @xmath52 and antenna frequency @xmath20 , and as functions of dmi constant @xmath52 and antenna amplitude @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that the magnetic skyrmion in a nanotrack with a smaller dmi constant @xmath52 is easier to overcome the potential barrier at given @xmath11 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",

    "[ se : microwave - nucleation ] with respect to the generation of the magnetic skyrmion at the source terminal of the magnetic skyrmion transistor , we also implement the microwave - current - assisted nucleation of the magnetic skyrmion . for the sake of low computational complexity , here we consider the model of a nanodisk instead of the nanotrack studied in last section . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6]a , a magnetic nanodisk initially magnetized along @xmath21-direction is built in the simulation , which has a diameter of @xmath54 nm and a thickness of @xmath55 nm . the current injection nano - contact is of @xmath56 nm in diameter and set in the central region of the nanodisk .    in order to create the magnetic skyrmion in the nanodisk ,",

    "ns , the magnetization of the central region reverses in a very short time ( @xmath69 ns ) , and generates a stable magnetic skyrmion , resulting in a rapid jump of the skyrmion number from @xmath70 to @xmath71 . after this rapid change",
    ", the skyrmion number stabilizes at @xmath71 , marking a success of the skyrmion nucleation .",
    "it should be noted that we also find the breathing of the magnetic skyrmion after its nucleation , which can be seen from the snapshots and the fluctuation of @xmath72 during the period of @xmath73 ns . at @xmath74",
    "ns , the magnetic skyrmion stops breathing and becomes a stable magnetic skyrmion .",
    "figure  [ fig6]b shows the case in the absence of the assistance of the microwave current . with the identical dc current density , no magnetic skyrmion is formed in the nanodisk in the absence of the microwave current .",
    "we also calculate the skyrmion number @xmath66 and find a slight fluctuation during the time within which the dc current is applied .",
    "the skyrmion number is equal to @xmath75 during the simulation .",
    "we also calculate the skyrmion number @xmath66 and only find a slight fluctuation near @xmath14 during the time within which the dc current is applied .",
    "it indicates that the dc current density of @xmath76 a m@xmath8 is smaller than the threshold current .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows the threshold current density @xmath61 as functions of frequency @xmath59 of the microwave current with a fixed microwave amplitude @xmath77 a m@xmath8 .",
    "since the power is in direct proportional to @xmath78 , where @xmath79 , we can obtain that the power is in direct proportional to @xmath80 . both the threshold current density and the corresponding @xmath80",
    "have been shown in fig .",
    "as can be seen , the average @xmath61 equals @xmath76 a m@xmath8 approximately when the microwave current is injected .",
    "there is an obvious frequency range , @xmath81 ghz @xmath82 ghz , where the required current density is much less than the average one . as a result",
    ", the energy consumption in whole process is also reduced as the injection time is fixed to be @xmath62 ns .",
    "it means that the energy consumption can be reduced with modulating the frequency of the additional microwave current .",
    "this behavior can be explained with the resonance below .",

    "when the frequency of the microwave current matches the resonance frequency , the momenta of the spin current are resonantly transferred to the local magnetic moment , resulting in the decrease of the total energy consumption .",

    "the injection of microwave current also impacts the value of @xmath80 which is direct proportional to the power as well as the energy consumption with fixed injection time .",
    "the results show that the amplitude and frequency of the assisted microwave current facilitate the creation of magnetic skyrmions . as a result",
    ", the energy consumption in the whole process is reduced as the injection time is fixed .",
    "so , the energy consumption required to create skyrmions in a limited time can be reduced by applying a microwave current with particular amplitude and frequency .",
    "we have proposed a magnetic skyrmion transistor operated and controlled by microwaves . it is demonstrated that the microwave field can lead to the motion of the magnetic skyrmion by exciting propagating spin waves , where the motion of the magnetic skyrmion is governed by a gate voltage . besides , the creation of the magnetic skyrmion at the source region of the magnetic skyrmion transistor is also assisted by a microwave current .",
    "it shows that the microwave current can reduce the energy consumption required for the nucleation of the magnetic skyrmion with a fixed time , and the reduction is significant when its frequency is close to the resonance frequency",
