    "all of these properties are consistent with the 60 kg case rd flux tubes discussed in sections [ sec : dynamics_rad ] and [ sec : emergence_properties ] .",
    "in this article , we modify the energy equation of our thin flux tube model to include the effect of flux tube heating due to radiative diffusion , unlike our simulations in articles 1 and 2 where the flux tube is assumed to evolve adiabatically .",
    "this allows us to study the influence of radiative diffusion , in conjunction with solar - like convective flows , on the dynamic evolution of active - region - scale magnetic flux tubes .    as a result of the inclusion of radiative diffusion to the thin flux tube energy equation , we find that flux tubes of @xmath160 kg subject to convective flows are no longer able to anchor in the overshoot region , unlike the flux tubes discussed in articles 1 and 2 .",
    "heating of the flux tubes supplied by radiative diffusion especially in the lower convection zone significantly increases the buoyancy of the flux tube earlier in its evolution .",
    "flux tubes of @xmath160 kg now float away from the base of the convection zone before magnetic buoyancy instabilities can set in to anchor the troughs of the flux tube in the overshoot region .",
    "this uniformly increased buoyancy of the flux tube early in its evolution results in a rise time of @xmath10.2 years for all flux tubes , which is significantly less than the maximum rise times of adiabatically evolving flux tubes by @xmath20.5 years .    unlike adiabatically evolving flux tubes of @xmath0 mx , flux tubes of @xmath160 kg that evolve with the addition of radiative heating exhibit a larger poleward deflection , especially at mid - to - high latitudes of @xmath2@xmath160@xmath80 .",
    "the drift of @xmath160 kg flux tubes from the base of the convection zone and subsequent lack of anchoring facilitates a poleward slippage , which is partially mitigated by convective flows .",
    "when radiative heating is included in the thin flux tube energy equation , we also find that all magnetic - field - strength flux tubes of @xmath0 mx still exhibit a joy s law trend in agreement with observations . however , flux tubes with magnetic field strengths of @xmath140 kg exhibit too large a tilt - angle scatter and too large a percentage of anti - hale tilt angles as compared to solar observations",
    ". these results point toward larger magnetic field strengths of @xmath15250 kg as the progenitors of solar active regions , inline with the adiabatically evolving flux tube simulations of articles 1 and 2 .",
    "we also discuss the problem of flux storage in the overshoot region when the effect of radiative diffusion on flux tube evolution is considered , suggesting that the time for flux tubes to escape from the overshoot region is highly sensitive to the value of the super - adiabaticity [ @xmath44 ] .",
    "when we allow flux tubes to originate in the overshoot region , all magnetic - field - strength flux tubes rise quasi - statically through the overshoot region .",
    "once they drift out of the overshoot region as a whole , the evolution of the flux tube proceeds in a similar way as when we initiate the flux tube 2.4 mm above the base of the convection zone .    in our treatment of the heat input per unit volume of the flux tube [ @xmath161 , we only include @xmath95 , the contribution from the deviation of the mean temperature gradient in the external plasma environment from that of radiative equilibrium .",
    "we have here neglected @xmath96 , the contribution from radiative diffusion across the flux tube due to the temperature difference between the flux tube and the external plasma environment .",
    "this is only a reasonable approximation for flux tubes in the range of @xmath162 kg for magnetic flux values of @xmath0 mx , on the order of the largest scale active regions .",
    "if @xmath96 were included and we performed simulations for flux tubes of @xmath163 mx , we suspect that the average rise times for these simulations would be slightly less than those reported in section [ sec : rise_times ] .",
    "following the results of articles 1 and 2 concerning tilt angle trends , we expect for smaller values of magnetic flux that the scatter of the tilt angle about the joy s law trend will increase with decreasing flux , as will the percentage of anti - hale tilt angles .",
    "the simulations performed in this article lead us to a better and more comprehensive understanding of the processes involved in flux emergence on the sun and solar - like stars .",
    "it is likely that if flux tubes are generated in the overshoot region by the dynamo process , they drift upward out of the overshoot region due to heating of the tube plasma as a result of the deviation of the temperature gradient from that of radiative equilibrium .",
    "once out of the overshoot region , flux tubes then drift away from the base of the convection zone as a whole due to an enhanced buoyancy supplied by radiative heating , only anchoring in the overshoot region if undular magnetic buoyancy instabilities grow sufficiently fast .",
    "only when reaching the middle to upper convection zone is the dynamic evolution of the flux tube well approximated by adiabatic evolution .",
    "our simulations show that flux tubes do not necessarily need to have anchored footpoints in the overshoot region to produce emergence properties similar to those of active regions on the sun .",
