    "the abell cluster a4059 is compact and dominated by a central cd galaxy eso  349-g010 .",
    "the cluster is classified as richness  1 and is at a redshift of 0.0487 ( abell , corwin , & olowin 1989 ; green , godwin , & peach 1990 , hereafter ggp ; schwartz et al .",
    "the cluster is not well studied in optical .",
    "of the 284 galaxies which have been identified as candidates for membership in the cluster , only 11 galaxies have known redshifts ( green et al .  1988 , 1990 ) .",
    "the redshift of the cd galaxy appears to be consistent with the cluster mean velocity within the measurement errors ( green et al .",

    "1991 ; taylor et al .  1994 ) .",
    "a vla a - array observation at 8.4 ghz ( taylor et al .",

    "the alignment of the radio structure , cd major axis , and the overall cluster elongation is an intriguing feature , which may help us understand the formation and evolution of cd galaxies and the radio sources associated with these galaxies ( west 1994 ) .",
    "observations with @xmath7 and _ exosat _ ( edge & stewart 1991 ; schwartz et al .  1991",
    "; edge , stewart , & fabian 1992 ) have established that the cluster is a bright x - ray source with strong cooling flow around the central cd galaxy .",
    "recent _ asca _ observation also revealed a possible chemical abundance gradient around the central cd galaxy ( ohashi 1995 ) .",
    "a similar feature has been seen in a few other clusters , such as the centaurus , awm7 ( ohashi 1995 ) , and virgo clusters ( matsumoto 1994 ) .",
    "excess soft x - ray absorption has been seen in the x - ray spectra of the central regions in a number of cooling flow clusters of galaxies .",

    "the cluster a4059 was observed with the rosat hri ( high resolution imager ) on 6 october , 1993 , for 6263 seconds in four observation intervals ( obis ) .",
    "the observation was centered at the cd galaxy pks2354 - 35 .",

    "the x - ray emission from the cluster is well confined within the rosat hri fov ( @xmath12 in diameter ) .",
    "thus , we can determine the x - ray emission background from within the hri field ; the background region is chosen to be an annulus centered at the cd galaxy pks2354 - 35 with the inner and outer radii being 700@xmath13 to 900@xmath13 , respectively .",
    "3.8truein    in order to provide spectral information to complement the hri spatial data , we retrieved the rosat pspc observation of a4059 .",

    "we first removed periods of high background from this data ( master veto rate @xmath14 ) .",
    "this resulted in a rejection of 107 seconds of exposure time .",
    "the spectral fitting of the data was done using the xspec package .",
    "the pointing accuracy of the rosat hri is important to our discussion of the central x - ray and radio structures in the cluster (   [ sec : central_radio ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , there are no ideal x - ray reference sources with accurate optical or radio positions in the hri field to calibrate the x - ray pointing accuracy .",
    "the sb galaxy , eso 349-g009 ( about @xmath15 to the north of the cd galaxy ) may be associated with an x - ray source , but the x - ray emission is extended , which makes the position measurement of the x - ray source and the correct optical correspondence uncertain .",
    "there are several other galaxies to the southeast of the cd galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xray_galaxies ] ) which may also have x - ray emission , but these x - ray sources are too weak for their positions to be determined accurately .",
    "thus , we rely on the absolute positions provided by the aspect solution of the star camera on rosat . based on previous experience",
    ", the hri x - ray images presented in this paper could have an absolute position error of up to about @xmath16 .",
    "we discuss the relative alignment of the optical , radio , and x - ray images in more detail in ",
    "[ sec : central_xray ] .",
    "as reported by _ exosat _ ( schwartz et al .  1991 ) and _ asca _ ( ohashi 1995 ) , the x - ray emission from the cluster is concentrated near the cd galaxy , pks2354 - 35 .",
    "figure  [ fig : xray_dss_whole ] shows the rosat hri image of the entire cluster superposed on an optical image from the digitized sky survey .",
    "the x - ray image was corrected for background and vignetting , and was adaptively smoothed with a signal - to - noise ratio of 5 per smoothing beam using our adaptive kernel image smoothing routine ( akis ; huang & sarazin 1996 ) .    to better compare the global x - ray and optical properties of the cluster",
    ", we also produced a smoothed galaxy optical surface brightness image of the cluster , which is shown superposed on the contours of the x - ray emission in figure  [ fig : xray_galaxies ] . in the smoothed optical surface brightness image , each galaxy was weighted by its @xmath17-band optical luminosity , and the image was then adaptively smoothed with at least 25 average galaxy luminosities per smoothing beam .",
    "the galaxy positions and luminosities are from ggp .",
    "we note that of the total of 284 galaxies listed as cluster members by ggp , only 11 galaxies have the measured redshifts .",
    "therefore , some of the galaxies in the ggp sample may be nonmember galaxies seen in projection against the cluster .",
    "although the large scale x - ray image of a4059 is elongated with nnw to sse , there also is some evidence for a concentration in the emission directly north of the central cd galaxy pks2354 - 35 . in figure",
    "[ fig : xray_dss_whole ] , this secondary peak appears in the general direction of the sb galaxy eso 349-g009 . with a blue magnitude of 14.6 ( ggp ) , this is the second brightest galaxy in the cluster . in the hri image",
    ", there is a broad peak in this region .",
    "the feature is stronger in the rosat pspc image , but the x - ray centroid lies about @xmath18 to the south of the galaxy .",
    "eso  349-g009 was classified by buta ( 1995 ) as a ring - type galaxy , which may indicate an interaction with another galaxy and/or strong star formation .",
    "in fact , the galaxy is a powerful iras source ( iras  23544 - 3457 ) with a luminosity from 40 to 120 @xmath19 m of @xmath20 l@xmath21 ( iras point source catalog 1988 ) .",
    "the galaxy is also a radio source with a flux density of @xmath22 mjy at the 1.4 ghz band from the nvss ( condon et al .",
    "1993 ) , which corresponds to @xmath23 w hz@xmath2 at the galaxy redshift ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the infrared and radio fluxes are consistent with the general correlation found for starburst galaxies ( condon 1992 ) . if eso 349-g009 is the source of the extra x - ray emission to the north of the cluster center , then its x - ray luminosity is approximately @xmath25 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "all of these properties are consistent with a strong starburst in eso 349-g009",
    ". this galaxy may be similar to ngc  6045 in the hercules cluster ( huang & sarazin 1996 ) .",
    "this may indicate that there exist a class of spiral galaxies in galaxy clusters which are currently undergoing strong star formation at a rate @xmath2610 times that of m  82 .",
    "alternatively , figure  [ fig : xray_galaxies ] suggests that there is a peak in the galaxy distribution to the north of the cluster center . because the grey scale image in this figure gives the optical surface brightness , part of this peak is due to eso 349-g009 .",
    "however , there may be a subcluster in this region , which provides the extra x - ray emission",
    ".    figures  [ fig : xray_dss_whole ] and [ fig : xray_galaxies ] show that the global x - ray emission is elliptical and elongated along the major axis of the galaxy luminosity distribution .",
    "the major axis of the cd galaxy is also aligned in the same general direction .",
    "to quantify elongation of the cluster , we have used the ellipse fitting routine in stsdas ( jedrzejewski 1987 ) to fit elliptical isophotes to the x - ray emission , to the cd galaxy optical surface brightness , and to the cluster galaxy optical luminosity distribution .",
    "the position angles ( @xmath27 ) and ellipticities are shown in figures  [ fig : ellipse_pa ] and [ fig : ellipse_e ] .",
    "the @xmath27 is measured counter - clock - wise from the north . the optical image of the cd is from the digitized sky survey .",
    "figure  [ fig : ellipse_pa ] shows that the major axis of the cd galaxy is in @xmath28 . in the outer regions ( @xmath29 ) , the x - ray emission seems to have the same orientation as the cd within the fitting errors .",
    "a similar result was found from a wavelet analysis of the rosat pspc image ( slezak et al .",
    "the outer x - ray orientation also agrees reasonably well with that of the smooth galaxy optical surface brightness , and the x - ray surface brightness and galaxy distribution give similar values for the ellipticity , as well .",
    "the galaxy distribution is at a slightly smaller position angle than either the x - ray emission or cd galaxy ( at smaller radii ) .",
    "our result for the orientation of the galaxy distribution are consistent with those of ggp .",
    "3.5truein    3.5truein    however , in the inner part ( @xmath30 ) of the x - ray image , the elongation of the x - ray surface brightness is is rotated by about 90 degrees with respect to the major axis of the cd galaxy .",
    "the x - ray image is also significantly more elliptical in the innermost regions .",
    "the sudden change in the @xmath27 is due to the x - ray bar structure in the central area .",
    "we will discuss this feature in detail in ",
    "[ sec : central ] .      to derive the x - ray surface brightness profile ,",
    "the x - ray emission was accumulated in circular annuli .",
    "tests have shown that the results for circular annuli are consistent with the results for elliptical annuli for moderate values of the ellipticity ( white et al .",
    "the x - ray counts in these bins were corrected for vignetting , exposure , and background .",
    "the count rate was then converted into a physical flux in the rosat x - ray band @xmath31 kev , assuming a raymond - smith thermal spectrum with a temperature of 3.43 kev (   [ sec : spectral_temp ] ) , the total ( galactic and intrinsic ) absorption column density @xmath32 @xmath5 (   [ sec : spectral_cool ] ) , and the abundances from the _ asca _ spectrum ( ohashi 1995 ) .",
    "the azimuthally averaged x - ray surface brightness profile is plotted in figure  [ fig : xray_surf_whole ] ( upper curve ) .",
    "the errors for each data point follow directly from poisson counting statistics including the background subtraction . from the x - ray surface brightness",
    ", one can derive the electron density distribution by de - projection ( fabian et al .",
    "spherical symmetry was assumed , and the same thermal spectrum was adopted as used in the conversion to the physical flux .",

    "1993 ) , it was argued that the two x - ray minima are due to the displacement of x - ray emitting gas by the radio plasma .",
    "however , in a4059 the radio emission at 1.4 ghz and 4.8 ghz does not extend into the central areas of the two x - ray holes , although it is possible that the radio source extends further at lower frequencies .    in the following ,",
    "we compare the nonthermal pressure in the radio lobes with thermal pressure of the x - ray emitting gas in the region around the radio lobes .",
    "because we are most interested in the interaction of the radio plasma and the x - ray emitting gas on the scale of the x - ray structures seen in figure  [ fig : xray_central_radio ] , we will estimate the radio pressure on the largest observed scales of the radio .",
    "the radio lobes end at about 35@xmath13 from the center , where the average electron density is about @xmath93 @xmath10 ( 90% confidence level ) .",
    "the x - ray gas thermal pressure is then @xmath94 ergs @xmath10 at this radius , assuming a gas temperature of @xmath46kev ( table  [ tab : spectral ] ) .",
    "the largest scale of the radio emission from the 1.4 ghz nvss radio image ( condon et al .",
    "1993 ) is about @xmath92 ( fwhm ) .",
    "pks2354 - 35 is a 1.27 jy source at 1.4 ghz , and has a spectral index of @xmath95 ( taylor et al .",
    "1994 ) . assuming that this extended radio flux comes from a uniform prolate cylindrical region of size @xmath92 , that the ratio of the energy of ions to electrons is unity , that the volume filling factor is unity , that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the line of sight , and that the lower and upper cutoff of the radio frequencies are 10 mhz and 100 ghz , respectively",
    ", we find a minimum energy magnetic field of 17 @xmath19 g , and a radio pressure of @xmath96 ergs @xmath10 ( e.g. , miley 1980 ) , which is about a factor of 5.8 smaller than the gas thermal pressure .",
    "but considering the uncertainties in the estimate of the minimum - energy radio pressure ( e.g. , if the energy ratio of ions to electron is 100 , the radio pressure becomes @xmath97 ergs @xmath10 ) , the radio pressure may be comparable to that of the thermal x - ray gas .",
    "closer to the center , nonthermal radio pressures are somewhat higher in the two radio lobes ; the pressures are @xmath98 ergs @xmath10 and @xmath99 ergs @xmath10 for the northern and southern radio lobes ,",
    "respectively ( taylor et al .  1994 ) .",
    "these pressures are , however , measured at a distance of @xmath100 from the radio core . on this scale ,",
    "the x - ray thermal pressure is about @xmath101 ergs @xmath10 .",
    "so , the thermal and nonthermal pressures are again comparable in the innermost regions , and it is possible that the radio lobes and the x - ray gas are in pressure equilibrium .",
    "this would be expected if the radio lobes have displaced , expanded against , and been confined by the x - ray gas .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation of the x - ray holes as regions where the radio source has displaced the x - ray gas .    on the other hand , it is odd that the radio emission in the available images does not appear to fill the observed x - ray holes .",
    "one possibility is that the relativistic electrons in the x - ray hole regions have undergone severe synchrotron losses , or that the x - ray holes are residuals of a previous epoch of radio activity . in a 17 @xmath19 g",
    "magnetic field , synchrotron losses dominate , and the lifetime of electrons emitting at a frequency of 1.4 ghz , the lowest frequency at which the source was observed and detected with on the largest linear size , is @xmath102 years . we can also estimate the age of the radio source from the variation in the radio spectral indices ( myers & spangler 1985 ) .",
    "taylor et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found that the spectral index of the radio source changed from @xmath103 at the radio core to @xmath104 at the faint , diffuse component to the radio lobes , which suggests this faint , diffuse radio component has been around for about @xmath105 years .",
    "thus , we are not surprised that much of the radio emission at 1.4 ghz or higher has faded beyond the region of the observed radio lobes .",
    "an upper limit to the age of the x - ray holes , assuming they are supported by nonthermal pressure , is the timescale for their disruption by rayleigh - taylor instabilities and/or by buoyant forces .",
    "roughly , either of these processes should occur on a timescale which is @xmath2610 times the sound crossing time of the holes in the surrounding x - ray gas .",
    "this maximum age is about @xmath106 years , which is much longer than the lifetime of electrons emitting at the observed radio frequencies .",
    "thus , it is possible that the radio emission from much of the region has faded , but that the lobes are still supported by the pressure of cosmic ray ion , low energy cosmic ray electron , and the magnetic field . in general , in a radio source with a steep spectrum like pks2354 - 35 ( taylor et al .  1994 ) , most of the nonthermal electron pressure is due to electrons at low energies , which might emit at very low radio frequencies .      as described in   [ sec : spatial ] , the x - ray isophotes for @xmath29 are aligned with the direction of elongation of the optical isophotes of the cd galaxy pks2354 - 35 , and the cluster galaxy isopleths .",
    "in addition , the strong radio lobes from the cd galaxy is also extended along the major axis of the cd potential .",
    "this is consistent with the anisotropic merger model for the formation cd galaxies and the orientation of their sources as proposed by west ( 1994 ) .",
    "west noted that the alignments in a4059 continue to larger scales , where the two nearest abell clusters also lie approximately along the same axis .",
    "in his model , cd galaxies were formed by anisotropic mergers occurring preferentially along an axis determined by large scale structure .",
    "gaseous accretion associated with these mergers determined the axis of rotation of a central black hole , and this is the axis along which radio jets propagate .",
    "evidence for the alignment of the x - ray emission , central cd galaxy , subclusters , host clusters , and surrounding superclusters have been proposed recently in many other clusters ( e.g. , west et al .",
    "1995 ; allen et al .  1995 ; west , jones , & forman 1995 ) .",
    "the central x - ray structure in the cd galaxy pks2354 - 35 is similar to that in ngc  1275 ( bhringer et al .",
    "1993 ) . in the case of ngc  1275 ,",
    "the regions of x - ray minima are filled by the radio lobes from the central cd galaxies .",
    "the radio nonthermal pressure in the lobes is comparable to the x - ray thermal pressure in the surrounding gas , within the errors .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the radio lobes have displaced the x - ray emitting gas , and are expanding against and being confined by this gas .",
    "the same model may apply to pks2354 - 35 in a4059 , but the radio emission does not seem to extend completely into the x - ray holes in either the 1.4 or 4.85 ghz radio images .",
    "it is possible that the extended radio emission has a very steep spectral index , and that lower frequency radio emission fills the x - ray holes .",
    "alternatively , it may be that the present period of radio activity in pks2354 - 35 is ending , or that the x - ray holes are relics of a previous epoch of activity .",
    "this might account for the absence of radio emission from the outer parts of the x - ray holes . in either scenario ,",
    "the holes may still contain cosmic ray ions , low energy cosmic ray electrons , and magnetic fields with a sufficient pressure to maintain the x - ray holes against the pressure of the surrounding x - ray emitting gas .",
    "an alternative interpretation for the central x - ray structure emphasizes the elongated x - ray bar rather than the x - ray holes .",
    "perhaps it is not that the x - ray emission from the holes is weak , but rather that the emission orthogonal to the direction of the holes ( along the bar ) is strong .",
    "the x - ray bar might be a disk of x - ray emitting gas seen edge - on .",
    "a disk might be formed from cooling flow gas with angular momentum , which becomes more rotationally supported as it contacts into the center of the cluster .",
    "eventually , part of the gas from this disk might feed an accretion disk around the central agn , and the radio jets may emerge perpendicular to this disk . recently , 2-d numerical simulations have shown that a rotationally supported disk can be formed under some circumstances in a cooling flow ( garasi , loken , & burns 1996 ) .",
    "on the other hand , nulsen , stewart , & fabian ( 1984 ) have argued that turbulent viscosity will effectively transport the angular momentum of cooling flow gas outward , and that the gas will not form a rotationally supported disk in the inner regions .",
    "a disk might also be formed due to a merge with a gas rich dwarf galaxy , although such galaxies are rare in centers of rich cluster .    in either case",
    ", there would be no reason to expect the initial angular momentum of the gas would be aligned with the major axis of the cluster and cd galaxy .",
    "however , west ( 1994 ) argues that cd galaxies are highly prolate , and that differential procession will cause accreting gas to settle into a disk which is perpendicular to the major axis of the galaxy , as required in a4059 .",
    "hydra a seems to show just such a disk , which is seen prominently in 21 cm h  i emission ( dwarakanat et al .  1995 ) .",
    "optical emission line spectra of the disk in hydra a show that it is rotating ( ekers & simkin 1983 ; baum et al .",
    "however , there is no similar evidence for a rotating disk in abell  4059 .",
    "in summary , we have analyzed the rosat hri image and pspc spectra of abell  4059 .",
    "the most striking feature of the x - ray image is the two x - ray holes and an orthogonal x - ray bar in the center of the cluster .",
    "it is likely that the radio plasma from the cd galaxy may have displaced the x - ray gas and created the x - ray holes , or we may be seeing a rotationally supported disk of the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "there may also be a moderate cooling flow in the center of the cluster , @xmath0 @xmath1 yr@xmath2 , as suggested by the x - ray surface brightness profile .",
    "however , such a cooling flow is not needed in the spectral fitting of the pspc data .",
    "it may be that the cooling flow has just begun in the center of the cluster .",
    "in addition , very little intrinsic absorption was found in the center of the cluster .",
    "this research was supported in part by nasa astrophysical theory program grant nag 5 - 3057 , nasa asca grant nag 5 - 2526 , and nasa rosat grant 5 - 3308 .",
    "the optical images are from the digitized sky survey .",
    "the palomar observatory sky survey was funded by the national geographic society , and the oschin schmidt telescope operated by the california institute of technology and palomar observatory .",
