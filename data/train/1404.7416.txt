    "analysis of properties of networks may regard different aspects .",
    "one of them is the identification of communities ; it is equivalent to a division of the network into sub - networks , sometimes partially overlapping .",
    "an informal definition says that a community is a set of nodes which are more densely connected to each other than to remaining nodes of the system @xcite .",
    "an exhaustive review of the methods of identification of communities has been presented in @xcite . here",
    "we note the well - known problem which arises when overlapping nodes are attached with the same strength to more than one community @xcite .",
    "another important problem is that it is difficult to indicate communities properly when communities differ significantly in their sizes @xcite .",
    "further , sometimes even though communities are well - defined , the link density is so homogeneous that it does not allow for their proper reconstruction of the communities by used algorithms @xcite .",
    "+ analysis of networks can regard also local aspects of the network structure , as degree of nodes and their neighbours . in networks with some symmetry",
    ", these local properties may be the same for different nodes .",
    "this observation allows us to group nodes into classes which differentiate these local properties @xcite .",
    "large size of networks is often an obstacle in simulations .",
    "the classification of nodes allows for an effective reduction of the system size which may preserve an information of system properties @xcite .",
    "+ the main issue of the paper is what we can infer about the class structure from the results of the analysis of the community structure .",
    "+ the paper is organised as follows : at first , the analysed networks are presented together with the methods of communities and classes identification .",
    "the following section [ results ] is devoted to the presentation of the results obtained from both these procedures .",
    "the last section contains our concluding remarks .",
    "as examples of networks which display both overlapping and symmetry , we use the networks constructed on bases of two instances of the lindenmayer systems ( l - systems ) @xcite  the sierpinski triangle and the koch curve . in the first case ,",
    "apexes of triangles are identified with network s nodes ( while we take into account that most of apexes belong to more than one triangle ) , and sides of triangles are identified with network s edges . in the case of the koch curve , the network nodes are identified with curve intersects . in the latter case ,",
    "we observe not only symmetry and overlapping communities but also differences of community sizes .      to identify communities we use the method proposed by us some years ago @xcite .",
    "the idea of the method is that a link weight between two nodes increases if these nodes have a common neighbour .",
    "according to the proposed set of differential equations , the connectivity matrix evolve , and weights of some edges increase while others decrease .",
    "the evolution equation is of the form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 - an element of the connectivity matrix , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the model parameter , which specifies a threshold between meaningful and negligible values of the product of two links weights . under these equations ,",
    "the time evolution of the method is fully deterministic , and therefore free from an inherent noise of monte carlo methods .",
    "the evolution process leads to a subsequent division of the nodes into communities .",
    "the accepted division is the one with the highest modularity value @xcite .",
    "+ here the connectivity matrix constructed for the analysed networks consists of 1 s and 0 s . if any two nodes are connected an appropriate matrix element is equal to @xmath4 , otherwise it is @xmath5 .",
    "application of our method to such a network gives only communities which are well defined . in the case of the networks analysed here",
    ", one can expect that overlapping nodes will be identified as one - node communities .",
    "however , to be able indicate connections of those nodes with other nodes in the network we slightly disturb the connectivity matrix .",
    "namely , we add a random number to each 0 and we subtract a random number from each 1 . if the amplitude of random numbers is small enough , such a modification - for sufficiently big statistics - does not destroy the network structure . yet ,",
    "an application of the method allows to divide the network into communities which contain overlapping nodes . + as our procedure involves a disturbance of the connectivity matrix by some random number it is necessary to indicate the amplitude of the used noise .",
    "this means that now we have two parameters : just mentioned amplitude and the parameter @xmath3 in the community identification procedure .",
    "the values of those parameters were found experimentally for each analysed network to obtain the division into communities which guarantees a maximal value of the modularity .",
    "the idea of the classes is based on the symmetry observed in networks , which causes that it is possible to indicate groups of states which are equivalent .",
    "the symmetry here means that some nodes have the same number of neighbours which belong to the same classes .",
    "this observation allows for the reduction of the system size , as the whole network can be represented in the equivalent way as the network of classes @xcite .",
    "the procedure of classes identification takes into account not only the number of neighbours of each node , but also the weights of connections .",
    "in particular , in some cases weights of edges between two nodes in both directions ( e.g. @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) may be different . because of that the full procedure takes into account the lists of in- and out - neighbours of each node . in the case of networks analysed here",
    ", the procedure may be simplified as networks are unweighted and undirected .",
    "the noise , remarked in the preceding section , is applied only in the search of communities , and not classes .",
    "details of the procedure of classes identification have been presented in @xcite .",
    "we present here only the main features of the method .",
    "the procedure of class identification is performed as follows : at first we check degrees of the nodes of the network .",
    "then , we assign to each node which has a given degree a unique symbol ( class identifier ) .",
    "subsequently we make lists of neighbours for each node , where we replace the node number with its class symbol .",
    "if the lists of neighbours for all nodes which have assigned the same symbol are not the same , we have to introduce additional distinction between nodes with the same degree .",
    "the classification is repeated until unique lists of neighbours for different class symbols are obtained .",
    "@xmath8 @xmath9 , no noise : _ in the case of the sierpinski triangle network consisting of @xmath10 nodes , the community identification method applied to the original connectivity matrix leads to the division of the network into @xmath11 communities of size @xmath11 each ( community @xmath4 - nodes @xmath4 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , community @xmath12 - nodes @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and community @xmath11 - nodes @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 communities of @xmath4 node each .",

    "the modularity is equal to @xmath21 for @xmath22 . here",
    "we see that the nodes which form one - element communities are of two types : the first type for nodes number @xmath5 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 and the second for nodes @xmath11 , @xmath20 and @xmath25 . + _ @xmath8 @xmath9 , noise : _ to indicate the connections between communities we add a noise of amplitude @xmath26 to the connectivity matrix elements and we record the obtained communities for independent @xmath27 realizations of the noise .",
    "the maximal obtained modularity is @xmath28 , for @xmath29 and the division of the network into @xmath11 communities .",
    "the obtained result can be presented in the form of histograms of the frequency of a given node being connected to a given original community of the size different than one .",
