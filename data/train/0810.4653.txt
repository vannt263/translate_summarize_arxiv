    "the standard model of three fundamental forces describes interactions of elementary particles very well . while the electromagnetic force has a long interaction range ,",
    "the short radius of the  weak force \" ( @xmath4 1/1000 fermi ) is determined by the heavy masses of mediating w and z bosons ( @xmath4 100 gev ) .",
    "the qcd forces are typically contained within a confinement radius of @xmath4 1 fermi .",
    "the effects of the long - range gravitational force can usually be neglected in elementary particle scattering experiments .",
    "the search for new forces of nature is a major goal of experiments at high - energy colliders .",
    "rare transitions and decays of fundamental particles can also shed light on new interactions .",
    "these experiments are probing for new forces at distances shorter than 1/1000 fermi .",
    "however , the existence of new forces at distances larger than the confinement radius of a nucleon ( @xmath4 1 fermi ) can also be probed and constrained by sensitive experiments .",
    "experimental searches for and limits on these new forces of nature can be pursued in two directions : ( a ) as deviations from the newtonian law of gravity where the new force is expressed as a modification of the @xmath5 law , usually by an additional yukawa term that can be parameterized with two parameters @xmath6 , the relative strength of new interaction , and @xmath7 , the characteristic radius of the interaction .",
    "applied in the analysis of experimental data at macroscopic distances down to @xmath4 a micrometer , this ansatz describes the possible deviations from classical gravity ; ( b ) as a quantum field theory description of the interactions ( excluding gravity ) in a covariant form , which can be expressed in the lowest perturbation order through the coupling constant @xmath8 and the mass of the exchanged particle mediating the interaction @xmath9 .",
    "covariant forms that can be consistently considered in this description are scalar ( s ) , pseudoscalar ( p ) , vector ( v ) , and axial vector ( a ) .",
    "we can argue that higher spins of the intermediate particle should not be considered since they lead to non - renormalizable theory .",
    "the particles that mediate the new force could be absent from the spectrum of known particles @xcite due to their small mass and coupling constant or due to some other reason that is helping them avoid detection . in any case , if these particles are not observed , direct experimental limits on their existence in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are required .    in section 2 of the present paper , we reanalyze the experimental small - angle @xmath0-elastic scattering data at high energy @xcite in terms of bounds on the existence of new forces expressed as s , p , v , or a covariant interactions . in section 3 ,",
    "we examine bounds that can be obtained from lower energy data .",
    "the data for small - angle @xmath0-elastic scattering at high - energy were obtained in the na-6 experiment @xcite performed at cern sps a quarter century ago .",
    "incident neutron energy in the experiment was 100400 gev , while the square of the 4-momentum transfer @xmath10 was varied in the range @xmath11 to @xmath12 gev@xmath13 .",
    "the data of this experiment are consistent with extrapolation of the hadronic amplitude from higher @xmath10 values , while at @xmath14 gev@xmath13 the differential cross - section rises due to schwinger scattering , which is the interaction of the neutron s magnetic moment with the coulomb field of the proton or electron .",
    "the purpose of na-6 @xcite was to measure hadronic interactions at high @xmath15 in the region of momentum transfer ( @xmath16 gev@xmath13 ) that was usually inaccessible in the scattering of charged hadrons due to coulomb interactions .",
    "this is the region where the effect of a new force mediated by a light particle may be present .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ( similar to fig . 16 from @xcite ) demonstrates that @xmath0 elastic scattering data in this experiment are well described by the following formula :     elastic differential neutron - proton cross - sections measured in experiment @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "the @xmath10 region measurable in @xmath17 scattering is shown with the effect of the coulomb interaction indicated by the dashed line.,width=480 ]    @xmath18 - 2 \\left(\\frac{\\alpha k_n}{m_n}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\pi}{t } \\;\\ ; , \\label{1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 gev@xmath21 were determined from the fit to the data ( data are taken from table 7 in @xcite ) , @xmath22 is the neutron mass , and @xmath23 is the neutron magnetic moment in nuclear magnetons .",
    "the factor of 2 in the schwinger term , as will be discussed later , accounts for the scattering of the neutron s magnetic moment on the proton plus an incoherent contribution of scattering on electrons ( gaseous hydrogen was used in @xcite as a target ) .",
    "smaller effects due to neutron polarizability are not included in the description of the data . this description ( [ 1 ] ) works rather satisfactorily with @xmath24=41.5 for 31 degrees of freedom .",
    "we will refer to this description as the  zero model \" since no new force contributions are included here .",
    "although quantum chromodynamics does not provide a detailed theoretical description of the hadronic elastic scattering at small @xmath10 , i.e. at large impact parameters , hadronic scattering has been studied experimentally in great detail in the past and was phenomenologically well understood , e.g. in the framework of regge models .",
    "the description of elastic data by a single exponent was a general universal feature of hadronic scattering observed at low @xmath10 in the region where it was not obstructed by coulomb scattering ( for example , see @xcite and also the comparison with other experiments in @xcite ) .",
    "this justifies , at a phenomenological level , our choice of the hadronic scattering description with a single exponent .",
    "however , in an attempt to improve the description of the data @xcite , we have tried several alternative modifications of the exponential term in the  zero model \" ( [ 1 ] ) involving additional parameters , including a quadratic term in the exponent and the sum of two exponents . in all of these cases ,",
    "@xmath24 per degrees of freedom was slightly increased demonstrating that more complicated modifications of the  zero model \" are not statistically justifiable .",
    "we describe the contribution of a new interaction in the following way : let us suppose that a new light particle with mass @xmath9 exists which interacts with the neutron and proton with couplings @xmath25 and @xmath26 correspondingly . assuming scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , and axial vector couplings of this particle with nucleons , we obtain the following addition to expression ( [ 1 ] ) :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the invariant energy square and @xmath29 is the nucleon mass .",
    "we parameterize the hadronic form factor s contribution as :    @xmath30    which comes from a @xmath31 decrease of the nucleon form factor , and we set @xmath32 equal to the mass of the lightest meson resonance with appropriate quantum numbers ( @xmath33 in the case of pseudoscalar ) .",
    "finally , we use the following amplitude squares for different couplings :    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36 \\;\\ ; , \\label{6}\\ ] ]    @xmath37 \\;\\ ; , \\label{7}\\ ] ]    where coupling constants @xmath38 .",
    "0.2 cm    it is quite natural to suppose that a new light particle s couplings with nucleons originates from its couplings with quarks . in this case ,",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) are modified . for the vector exchange , the induced magnetic moment",
    "s interaction term should be added to the scattering amplitude . since its numerator contains momentum transfer divided by @xmath39 , which in considered kinematics gives a factor much smaller than 1 , we can safely neglect it and use ( 6 ) in what follows .",
    "the case of the axial vector exchange is more delicate and discussed in detail in the appendix .",
    "we can now turn to the discussion of other features of the @xmath0 elastic scattering amplitude . though the strong interaction amplitude can not be determined theoretically from the first principles , our confidence that @xmath40 dependence is absent in strong interactions for @xmath41 opens the road to bounding the light particle exchange if its mass is smaller than that of the @xmath42-meson .",
    "experimental data at @xmath41 matter for our bounds , which makes the precise value of @xmath32 in the expression for @xmath43 not important , since in the relevant domain of @xmath10 the form factor is close to @xmath44 . for the same reason ,",
    "no form factor is introduced for the schwinger term in ( [ 1 ] ) .    for each fixed set of parameters @xmath45 and @xmath9 describing the possible contribution of a  new force \" , we are fitting the experimental distribution with a combined function ( [ 1])+([2 ] ) , where parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 describing the standard hadronic contribution are free .",
    "then the maps of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and the minimum values of @xmath24 are composed as functions of @xmath45 and @xmath9 . analyzing the @xmath24 map , we determined the level of @xmath24 @xcite above which parameters of the  new force \" become incompatible with experimental data at a confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "greater than 90% . at this level",
    "we also examined and ensured that parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 remain within the 90% c.l .",
    "close to those in the  zero model \" . in this way , we can ensure that the  new force \" contribution does not substitute for the standard hadronic plus electromagnetic contributions in the description of the data .",

    "this property of high - energy scattering amplitudes would allow us to determine the value of the spin of the  new physics \" mediator ; ( b ) the pseudoscalar exchange vanishes at @xmath56 .",
    "these comments explain why we will get the strongest bounds on @xmath57 and @xmath58 , a weaker bound on @xmath59 , and no bound on @xmath60 .    before presenting fit results ,",
    "let us explain why we neglect the interference of a new particle exchange amplitude with the strong amplitude and with the photon exchange ( schwinger ) amplitude .",
    "the strong amplitude is almost entirely imaginary in the energy domain studied in @xcite ( @xmath61 @xcite ) .",
    "that is why it does not interfere with the real amplitude of a point - like new particle exchange .",
    "interference of the strong amplitude ( as well as the new force amplitude ) with the schwinger term is negligible since the interference term is constant at @xmath56 , , @xmath62 , which multiplies @xmath63 cancelling the @xmath64 enhancement , or @xmath65 giving zero .",
    "] unlike the square of the schwinger amplitude , which contributes significantly at small @xmath10 because of @xmath40 behavior .",
    "the mass of a light particle @xmath9 was bounded in our fits to be below 100 mev , and the range of the coupling constants varied depending on the particular model .",
    "compilation of the bounds obtained from the @xmath24 limit for p , s , v , and a models in coordinates @xmath66 versus @xmath9 is presented in figure [ fig3 ] .",

    "we found that these conditions are satisfied if @xmath70 for the s , v , and a - models , and can not be satisfied for any value of @xmath9 for the p - model .",
    "thus , our bounds on the coupling strength @xmath66 shown in figure [ fig3 ] should only be referred to in these validated domains ( indicated in figure [ fig3 ] by brackets ) .",
    "no consistent limit can be set for the p - model .",
    "in addition , we should notice that the very high value of @xmath60 obtained from the @xmath24 analysis for the p - model makes our perturbative approach of formula ( [ 5 ] ) not valid .",
    "we should conclude therefore that the experimental data @xcite do not provide any limit for the pseudoscalar exchange .",
    "the factor of 2 in the schwinger term of the  zero model \" in ( [ 1 ] ) is coming from both @xmath71 and @xmath72 scattering and is an estimate of equal contribution from both .",
    "however , @xmath72 scattering occurs in a different kinematical range and the event selection criteria in @xcite could suppress the detection of electrons .",
    "consequently , we varied the factor in the schwinger term of the  zero model \" ( [ 1 ] ) from 1 ( no @xmath72 contribution ) to 3 ( double @xmath72 contribution ) and found in analysis that this variation was not very significant , changing our limiting value for @xmath66 by @xmath73 8% for a fixed value of @xmath9 .",
