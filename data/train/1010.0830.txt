    "the thermal emission from interplanetary dust particles ( idps ) , called zodiacal light emission ( zle ) , is a well known source of foreground in the ( far)ir sky .",

    ", contribution at frequencies @xmath0  ghz will be likely detectable by .",
    "the simple scaling law of @xcite predicts a small but not negligible contribution at 70150  ghz , of particular interest in cmb studies .",
    "theoretical estimates @xcite suggest that the collective emission of kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) and other minor bodies could produce imprints in cmb surveys .",
    "cmb anisotropy maps derived from wmap data are well consistent with the standard @xmath1cdm cosmological model . however , there are some intriguing deviations at large angular scales , such as those related to the angular power spectrum ( aps ) at low multipoles @xmath2 s @xcite .",
    "other anomalies regard the alignment of low multipoles @xcite and to the north ",
    "south asymmetry of the aps with respect to the ecliptic plane @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite detected a localized non - gaussian behavior in the southern hemisphere using a wavelet analysis technique , see also @xcite , and @xcite recently identified an intriguing excess of emission in wmap 5 years ilc map along the ecliptic plane .",
    "their results will be discussed later in more detail .",
    "if not produced by systematic effects @xcite these features could be of cosmological origin @xcite or effects produced by some foreground within the near universe @xcite , the galaxy @xcite , or the solar system @xcite .",
    "it can not be excluded that some diffuse solar system emission could contribute at low @xmath2 s at wmap frequencies @xcite .",
    "such foreground would exhibit planar symmetry with respect to the ecliptic ( or some plane slightly tilted with respect to it ) . according to ( far)ir measures ,",
    "the `` classical '' zle is the thermal emission of sub - mm idps , with orbital radii within 5  au , characterized by a @xmath3 scaling below 1  thz @xcite .",
    "if larger particles exist , their emission would add to the classical zle , producing a signal at mm wavelengths , ranging between about @xmath4 and @xmath5 times the classical zle , with a less steep spectrum , @xmath6 , as suggested by several models @xcite .",
    "such particles can be produced by the erosion of kbos due to mutual collisions or by the erosion of incoming interstellar dust and they should be located beyond jupiter",
    ". they would be then colder and possibly larger than the idps responsible for the classical zle .",
    "impact detectors onboard interplanetary probes reveal that such particles indeed exist @xcite , but very little is known about their nature .",
    "motivated by these considerations , we reconsider the problem of diffuse solar system emission at cosmological frequencies , by introducing a toy model of emission from the kbo dust particles , that we will call in this paper kbo emission ( kboe ) , and evaluating its implications for cmb observations .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     * correlation function  * the two point correlation function is defined as @xmath7 where the symbol @xmath8 stands for the average over an ensemble of realizations in which the directions @xmath9 and @xmath10 form an angle given by @xmath11 . in @xcite it is shown that at angular scales greater than about @xmath12 the wmap data occur in @xmath13% of realizations of the concordance model ( see also @xcite and references therein ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : two : b ] we show @xmath14 ( black line ) obtained through @xmath15 montecarlo ( mc ) random realizations extracted from the wmap 7  yr best fit @xmath1cdm model whose aps is displayed in fig .",

    "these random realizations properly take into account the anisotropic white noise level of the @xmath16 band channel of wmap 7  yr data .",

    "the green dotted - dashed line refers to the map derived subtracting from the ilc 7  yr map one of our kboe model , namely that obtained for the cm with @xmath20 .",
    "it is interesting to note how well the green line is ( almost ) always well consistent within 1@xmath19 level with the @xmath1cdm model whereas the blue line ( i.e. the wmap 7  yr ilc map ) is often out of the 1@xmath19 contour , especially at large angular scale .",
    "this improvement is typical of our kboe templates for the cm , while the templates for the wm do not change much the wmap 7  yr ilc map correlation function .",
    "* cosmological parameters  * we quantify here the impact of the removal of the kboe emission on cosmological parameters .",
    "the increase of the amplitude at low multipoles has interesting consequences on some of the cosmological parameters . for this purpose",
    ", we use the wmap 7  yr likelihood code publicly available with the option of a pixel likelihood code at low resolution and substitute the wmap 7  yr ilc map with the kboe cleaned one .",
    "the markov chain monte carlo package cosmomc @xcite is connected with this modified likelihood code . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] the removal of a solar system contamination ( namely the cm with @xmath21 ) modifies slightly the amplitude and the spectral index of scalar perturbations ( by choosing a pivot scale @xmath22 ) in a standard @xmath1cdm scenario characterized by @xmath23 cosmological parameters ( plus the amplitude of the residual sunyaev - zeldovich effect ) : as expected by fig .",
    "[ fig : two : a ] , a slightly larger value for the amplitude of primordial fluctuations is preferred by the larger amplitude of the temperature anisotropies at low @xmath2 s .",
    "we find a little impact of the removal of this foreground on the constraints on the spatial flatness of our universe .",
    "a larger effect is expected in extensions of the @xmath1cdm model in which the small value of the quadrupole plays a relevant role : fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] shows how smaller values of the running of the scalar spectral index @xmath24 are preferred once the kboe is removed ( in this last case we have adopted an optimal pivot scale @xmath25 ) .",
    "it is important to note how the change in the mean value of @xmath26 we obtain is @xmath27 after removing the kboe template .",
    "such difference is comparable with the sensitivity to @xmath26 : it is therefore important to assess foreground contamination on large scales to infer on the primordial spectrum of density perturbations .",
    "also , since correcting for kboe the low multipole tail in tt is not so suppressed , including tensor perturbations in the analysis , we find that , the upper limit on tensor - to - scalar ratio of primordial perturbations , @xmath28 , is relaxed to @xmath29 ( at 95%cl ) , compared 0.36 given in @xcite . note that this effect is due to the larger relevance of temperature information with respect to polarization in wmap data .",

    "@xmath43 the spherical harmonics behave as @xmath44 and the map @xmath42 has even parity for even @xmath2 and odd parity for odd @xmath2 .    at large scales ,",
    "we expect a sachs - wolfe plateau in terms of tt aps , therefore we roughly forecast the same amount of power in even and odd maps . it has been recently proved that for wmap data at the large scales @xcite , precisely in the range of @xmath45 , the total power coming from even @xmath2 s is unlikely smaller than the total power present in the odd @xmath2 s .",
    "the probability related to this event is as low as @xmath46 for the wmap 7  yr data @xcite ( see @xcite for a temperature and polarization joint analysis ) .",
    "the analysis of this power asymmetry was first proposed in @xcite to test the presence of foreground residuals since templates of dust , free - free or synchrotron emission possess a large parity asymmetry .",
    "also the kboe template we propose in this paper , as well as the standard zle , is highly parity - asymmetric .",
    "therefore it is worth to study its possible impact on the wmap ilc 7  yr map , of course under the assumption that a residual of the kind considered in the current paper , is present in the ilc map .",
    "we consider the same estimator of @xcite defined as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 here with @xmath49 we mean the sum over even or odd @xmath2 s respectively in the considered range ( here @xmath50 ) .",

    "black vertical line ( on left ) stands for the wmap 7  yr ilc map .",
    "the probability to have this value is as low as @xmath53 .. this might be due to the details of the mc , like number of simulations , resolutions of maps and the considered fwhm .",

    "note that the probability associated to the green line ( i.e. cm and @xmath20 ) is @xmath55 and the probability associated to the blue line ( i.e. cm and @xmath21 ) is @xmath56 .",
    "the parity anomaly is removed when these templates are properly taken into account . in the definition of the parity estimator in the current paper we adopted @xmath57 , just for simplicity and since for that @xmath58 value",
    "the anomaly is remarkable .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , in the wmap tt spectrum there is a whole multipole range , rather than a single @xmath58 value , where the wmap 7 parity anomaly holds .",
    "this dims significantly the case for posterior biasing . in analogy to what performed for the quadrupole , we have implemented a simple monte - carlo simulation in order to evaluate the probability that cmb even multipoles phases ( up to @xmath57 ) anti - correlate with the `` deterministic '' ones of kboe .",
    "we extracted @xmath59 random cmb realizations from the best fit of @xmath1cdm model obtained by wmap 7  yr data and , for each of them , we have added our template and evaluated the modified spectrum . hence , considering only the cm , we have found that the probability of lowering the estimator @xmath32 is @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "similarly , we computed the probability of lowering the `` even powers '' up to @xmath57 for some fixed threshold .",
    "for instance , for @xmath63 the probability to decrease the total even band powers of at least @xmath66 with respect to the realization ( or to the fiducial @xmath1cdm model ) is @xmath67 @xmath68 , whereas it is @xmath69 @xmath70 for @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "this shows that for @xmath33 larger than few tens of degrees the anti - correlation probability turns out to be not negligible .",
    "these numbers show that , contrarily to the quadrupole case discussed above , in this case the dependence on @xmath33 is important .     predicted signal in the combination @xmath75 from the cm with @xmath76 ( bottom ) , @xmath77 ( middle ) , and @xmath78 ( top ) .",

    "compare this plot with fig .  1 of diego et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) based on wmap data : the model with @xmath76 seems to agree better with the observations .",
    ", width=453 ]    * alignments  * we have seen how the removal of the kboe template ( for the cm ) can reduce the unlikeliness of some estimators , as the @xmath81 and those related to them .",
    "our preliminary tests carried out using a public code for the multipole vectors decomposition by @xcite show that this does not happen for the estimators based on @xmath82 phases by means of which alignment anomalies are detected .",
    "* ecliptic excess in wmap data  * in @xcite , the authors look at the linear combination @xmath75 of wmap bands . in their analysis ,",
    "the wmap bands have been cleaned of galactic contamination and the bright point sources have been masked .",
    "the linear combination @xmath75 gets rid off the cmb signal completely and should contain a linear combination of the instrumental noise in each band , beam effects and residual galactic and extragalactic foregrounds not accounted for in the cleaning ( and masking ) process .",
    "after masking out the galactic plane , the authors found a significant large scale signal aligned with the ecliptic plane with a grey - body spectrum ( see fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "a galactic origin for this signal was ruled out due to the high latitudes where it was found .",
    "an extragalactic origin was also ruled out due the highly anisotropic distribution of this signal . in that paper",
    "it was suggested a possible origin in the zle but extrapolations from actual measurements from cobe / firas predicted a much smaller signal than needed to account for the excess in the ecliptic plane . the present paper offers a fresh alternative to explain the excess by assuming a different population of larger dust grains .",
    "we have combined the signal expected from our kboe models with the instrumental noise and beam of wmap and built templates of the @xmath75 maps . in fig .",
    "[ fig : five ] we show the predicted signal from the three cm models . the comparison with the signal detected by @xcite ( see their fig .",
    "1 ) shows that the model with @xmath76 seems to agree better with the observations than the others .",
    "the areas near the galactic plane show no evidence of excess appearing in wmap data , that could be due to residual synchrotron emission .",
    "note that while kboe should be positive in @xmath75 , the synchrotron signal shows up as a negative signal in the combination @xmath75 .",
    "we exploited a simple toy model for diffuse emission from cold and large dust grains expected to exist in the outer part of the solar system and requiring only a modest amount of mass , with signal amplitudes , constrained in the far",
    " ir by cobe data , compatible with simulations existing in literature .",
    "we have produced and analyzed templates derived subtracting our toy model from wmap ilc 7  yr maps to investigate on cosmological implications of such a foreground .",
    "we find that the anomalies related to the low quadrupole of the angular power spectrum , the two point correlation function , and the parity are significantly alleviated .",
    "no significant impact has been found on low multipole alignments ; of course , this does not exclude that more detailed models constructed in this framework could have consequences for these estimators .",
    "it is interesting to note that there might be a relationship between the lack of effect of our model on the alignment of the low multipoles and the low amplitude of the quadrupole measured by wmap .",
    "if the cmb intrinsic quadrupole is anti - correlated ( i.e. with a similar pattern but opposite sign ) with the ecliptic plane , any signal originating in our solar system ( like those considered in this paper ) would _ compete _ with the cmb quadrupole , reducing its measured amplitude . on the other hand , the subtraction of the solar system signal to the measured quadrupole would not change the orientation of the resulting signal since the subtraction operation transforms the anti - correlated signal in a correlated one and both patterns add up .",
    "a visual example of this can be found for instance in fig .",
    "9 of @xcite where also a hypothetical signal that traces the ecliptic plane is assumed .",
    "the same authors also demonstrate how signals in the ecliptic plane affect ( significantly ) only the even multipoles .",
    "consequently , the octupole ( @xmath83 ) would remain basically unchanged .",
    "the kboe is able to explain the excess of signal found in @xcite , in particular for cold dust particles and for a high @xmath84 .",
    "finally , we showed that this foreground has an impact for some cosmological parameters characterizing the spectrum of primordial density perturbations , relevant for on - going and future cmb anisotropy experiments .",
    "clearly , the model needs to be improved in the future and tested against the data from the satellite .",
    "our analysis shows that it will be relevant to include , or at least to test , such component in the analysis of microwave anisotropy data at large scales .",
