    "proton and neutron ( @xmath0 ) correlation is one of the key phenomena to understand properties of nuclei along the @xmath10 line in the nuclear chart ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) . unlike in identical pair correlations , two channels , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are possible in @xmath0 pair correlations , and both channels play an important role in various nuclear structures .",
    "competition between @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath0 pairs has been attracting a great interest and discussed to describe level ordering of @xmath11 and @xmath12 states in @xmath1 nuclei and neighboring nuclei . in the heavy - mass region ,",

    "the @xmath5 @xmath0 pair is the mirror state of the dineutron pair , which is often discussed in neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "the appearance of the @xmath4 @xmath0 pair is peculiar to @xmath1 nuclei . unlike the @xmath5 pair",
    ", the @xmath4 @xmath0 pair has the finite intrinsic spin @xmath14 like a deuteron , and therefore it provides different @xmath15 states in low - energy region because of angular momentum coupling .",
    "indeed , it is experimentally known that many @xmath4 states coexist along with the @xmath12 state in low - energy spectra of @xmath1 nuclei @xcite . moreover",
    ", a high @xmath15 state with @xmath4 comes down to the ground state in many @xmath1 nuclei in the light - mass region except for those with closed - shell cores .",
    "for example , the ground state spin parity of @xmath3 with @xmath16 is @xmath17 , for which the importance of three - nucleon forces is discussed in the no - core shell model calculations @xcite .    in systematic study of general @xmath1 nuclei , it is important to describe the competition between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath0 correlations while taking into account spin configurations as well as nuclear deformation . in the light - mass @xmath10 region ,",
    "cluster structure is another important feature which brings rich structures together with the @xmath0 correlations .",
    "the @xmath0 pair feature and its dynamics can be affected by the cluster structure .    to deal with these problems",

    "the @xmath2 constraint amd has been proved to be a useful approach to study structures of stable and unstable nuclei . in the amd method ,",
    "existence of a core nucleus , a @xmath0 pair , and a cluster structure are not _ apriori _ assumed , but degrees of freedom of all nucleons are independently treated in basis wave functions given by slater determinants of gaussian wave packets .",
    "nevertheless , if a system favors a structure with a @xmath0 pair and cluster structures , such the structure is obtained in the energy variation . in the new method ,",
    "the isospin projection is performed before the energy variation to obtain the amd wave function optimized for each isospin state .",
    "we call this method , the isospin projected @xmath2 constraint amd , @xmath18-amd .",
    "energy levels of @xmath1 nuclei are calculated with the @xmath18-amd method combined with the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) , called @xmath18-amd+gcm . to test the applicability of the new framework ,",
    "we apply the method to @xmath19b , in which @xmath20 structures are found in low - lying @xmath4 and @xmath5 states . we investigate @xmath0 correlations around the @xmath21 core , and show the importance of the finite spin of the @xmath4 @xmath0 pair , which couples with the @xmath0 motion and the core rotation , in the low - lying states of @xmath19b .",

    "the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics is one of the useful approaches to describe the cluster aspect of light nuclei .",

    ", we explain the framework of the isospin projected amd , which is a newly developed method for the study of @xmath1 nuclei .",
    "we also describe the detailed formulation of the present calculation which is based on the isospin projected version of the @xmath2 constraint amd combined with the gcm .      the amd framework is based on a variational method .",
    "an amd wave function is a slater determinant of gaussian wave packets : @xmath22 where @xmath23 refers to the antisymmetrization operator and @xmath24 refers to the @xmath25th single - particle wave function .",

    "the parity projection is performed before the energy variation but the angular momentum projection is done after the variation to save computational costs except for the extended amd calculation with the variation after the parity and angular - momentum projections ( amd+vap@xmath37 ) @xcite .",
    "namely , energy variation is performed for the amd wave function projected on to the parity eigenstate with the parity projection operator @xmath38 as @xmath39 the expectation value of an observable @xmath40 is calculated by the parity and angular momentum eigenstates @xmath41 projected from the obtained amd wave function as , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the angular momentum projection operator . for numerical calculation of the energy variation , we adopt the frictional cooling method , which is a gradient method .    to describe the ground and excited states , we superpose various amd wave functions based on the gcm with the @xmath2 constraint amd method @xcite , which is an efficient method to choose basis amd wave functions for a multi - configuration calculation .    in the @xmath2 constraint amd ,",

    "the coefficients @xmath55 are determined by the diagonalization of the hamiltonian and norm matrices .      in @xmath1 nuclei ,",
    "the isospin projection is necessary to describe different isospin states @xmath56 , which degenerate in a low - energy region .",
    "as done for the parity projection , the isospin projection enables us to obtain the better wave function optimized for each isospin .",
    "the isospin projection is also important to obtain proper intrinsic spin structures because the isospin of a @xmath0 pair restricts the intrinsic spin of the pair because of the fermi statistics of two nucleons .",

    "it is notable that there is a gap along the line from ( 0.2,0.1 ) to ( 0.6,0 ) .",

    ", the spatial motion of the @xmath0 pair as well as the core rotation is taken into account .",
    "the @xmath18-amd+gcm calculation reproduces reasonably the properties of low - lying states of @xmath3 .",
    "the structures of the lowest four states ( @xmath129 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath144 ) are understood by the angular momentum coupling of the @xmath0 pair internal spin ( @xmath13 ) , its spatial motion , and the core rotation .",
    "the @xmath129(@xmath117 ) state is described by the @xmath20 structure having the @xmath141 @xmath0 pair in the @xmath59-wave(@xmath13-wave ) around the @xmath21 core .",
    "because of the spin - orbit attraction from the core for the @xmath14 @xmath0 pair in the @xmath59-wave , the @xmath129 state comes down to the ground state .",
    "the @xmath118 appears from the excitation of the @xmath21 core rotation and has the strong @xmath8 transition to the @xmath117 state .",
    "the @xmath144 state , which is the isobaric analogue state of the @xmath19be ground state , is regarded as the spin partner of the @xmath117 state , and it has the strong @xmath6 transition from the @xmath117 state .",
    "it was found that the @xmath18-amd+gcm can describe spin configurations and spatial development of the @xmath0 pair in @xmath4 and @xmath5 states as well as the core deformation and rotation .",
    "the @xmath0 pair motion relative to the core and also the shape fluctuation of the deformed core are taken into account by the @xmath2 constraint with the gcm .",
    "this is one of the advantages supplier to the amd+vap@xmath155 which is based on the the @xmath151-projected wave function of a single slater determinant .",
    "it was also shown that the isospin projection before the energy variation is necessary to obtain the optimum solution for each isospin state in @xmath156 nuclei , in which different isospin states almost degenerate in the low - energy region .",
    "the present method is expected to be useful to investigate structure with a @xmath0 pair around a deformed core in other @xmath1 such as @xmath157 and @xmath158 , in which various @xmath148 states appear in low - lying spectra . in principle , in the @xmath18-amd+gcm , existence of a @xmath0 pair nor clusters is not _ apriori _ assumed .",
    "therefore , it is applicable to general @xmath1 nuclei , and might enable us to make systematic study of @xmath0 pair correlations in nuclei along the @xmath10 line .",
