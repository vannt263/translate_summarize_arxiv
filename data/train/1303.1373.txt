    "terahertz ( thz ) technology and science have spread with ever - growing applications in military and security systems , medicine , biology , and researches . to exemplify : security screening at airports @xcite , shipment inspection @xcite , identification of concealed explosives , drugs and weapons @xcite , cancer and burn diagnosis @xcite , and in spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "thus , knowing the effects of thz radiation is critical for different scientific and technological purposes .    despite the presence of research on the biological effects of thz radiation @xcite",
    ", there are still many controversies . in addition",
    ", the emergence of strong sources of thz radiation may contribute to the resolution of controversies over the mechanism of biological organization @xcite .",
    "the potential of this perspective depends on the development of sophisticated pump - probe and multidimensional experimental techniques and the study of biological systems in the controlled environments necessary for their maintenance and viability @xcite .    in order to assess the possible genotoxicity of thz radiation with biological materials , in the framework of the thz - brigde project @xcite ,",
    "various studies were conducted to investigate the biological response .",
    "recently , a careful analysis of these studies was successfully performed in @xcite , in which the authors explored the existence of thz related effects on gene expression that can be unambiguously distinguished from thermal effects .",
    "it was suggested that thz radiation may affect gene expression by perturbing the conformational dynamics of double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) @xcite .",
    "these studies were inspired by prior ones @xcite .",
    "as thz photons do not carry enough energy to directly alter chemical reactions , nonlinear resonance effects may cause local changes of breathing dynamics in these systems @xcite",
    ".    motivated by this fact , alexandrov et al . studied the influence of a thz field into the dynamics of a homogeneous poly(a ) dna molecule with 64 base pairs ( bps ) @xcite . to model the interactions of dsdna with thz field , they made use of the peyrard - bishop - dauxois ( pbd ) model @xcite .",
    "they regarded periodic driving and frictional terms in the absence of thermal noise . in that study , they found breather modes ( localized periodic motions of the double strand ) under certain conditions .",
    "hence , they concluded that the main effect of thz radiation is to influence resonantly into the dynamical stability of the dsdna . though swanson later showed that these breather modes can be eliminated by changing the pbd model parameters or by including thermal noise @xcite , he agreed that under assumptions concerning drag and drive forcing , breather modes can be generated at certain resonant frequencies .",
    "the pbd model is useful because it allows us to study the equilibrium and dynamic properties of dna .",
    "it has potential ability to describe the melting transition and denaturation bubbles of the dsdna such as those that occur during the initial stage of the transcription process .",
    "some specific correlation with transcription initiation sites has been claimed @xcite and debated @xcite .",
    "tapia et al .",
    "@xcite set suitable parameter values for pbd model and studied the formation and stabilities of bubbles in the system .",
    "they used an enhanced model that includes solvent interactions through the addition of a gaussian barrier to the morse potential @xcite .",
    "this barrier modifies the melting transition and the dynamics of the molecule .",
    "they also focused on the application of the principal component analysis ( pca ) of the trajectories under equilibrium conditions .",
    "even if both the pbd model and the interaction with external field taken as alexandrov are quite simple , they could give some insights in the understanding of the interaction of thz field with the dna molecule .",
    "for these reasons our purpose is to study the effect of the thz field on thermal and dynamic properties of dna : melting transition and bubble formation at physiological temperatures in the framework of the pbd model .",
    "we used a modified version of the model with the inclusion of solvation barrier and included thermal noise . both homogeneous and heterogeneous chain",
    "are studied in order to approach more to reality .",
    "the heterogeneous chain is the adeno - associated viral p5 promoter ( aav p5 promoter or p5 promoter ) , which has been widely studied @xcite and plays an important role in the aav dna replication @xcite and the regulation of the aav gene expression @xcite .",
    "this work is divided as follows : in section ii we describe the model ; in section iii the methods are summarized ; in section iv an analysis of the response of the system at different frequencies and field amplitudes is made .",
    "after that , we will show the influence of thz field , with specific parameters , into melting transition ( section v ) and denaturation bubbles ( section vi ) .",
    "the last section is devoted to conclusions .",
    "the pbd model is a mesoscopic dynamical model of the dna molecule .",
    "it describes the stretching of the bonds between the bps through a single variable , which condenses all the atomic coordinates of a bp .",
    "this model ignores the helicoidal structure and uses the morse potential to model hydrogen bonding between bps . a non - linear inter - pair stacking potential is also considered .",
    "we use a modification of the pbd model including a solvation barrier inside of the morse potential .",
    "this barrier prevents the closing of the base once it is opened .",

    "the term @xmath13 accounts for the stacking interactions and is given by    @xmath14    the effect of this term , whose intensity is governed by @xmath15 , is to change the effective coupling constant from @xmath16 to @xmath17 when one of the bps is displaced away from its equilibrium position",
    ". the parameter @xmath18 sets the scale length for this behavior .",
    "alternatively , inhomogeneous stacking energy can be also considered @xcite .",

    "the larger probabilities in p5 promoter occur in two sites of biological interest as previously reported : the tss ( represented by + 1 ) and the tata box ( between -30 and -40 ) . increasing the field amplitude leads to the increase of opening probability at these sites and helps the opening of others . without the thz field ,",
