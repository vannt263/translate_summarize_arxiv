    "the discovery of the standard model ( sm)-like higgs at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) provides the last link towards validating the sm @xcite .",
    "however , much work still remains in establishing the nature of the higgs boson , as well as studying possible extensions of the sm higgs sector .",
    "a complete characterization of all possible decay modes of the sm - like higgs is crucial . while the discovery of the higgs relied on conventional search channels @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 with event rates compatible with sm predictions , the limit on the branching ratio to exotic states is rather weak @xcite .",
    "if the higgs decay branching fractions indeed show a departure from the sm , it would become very important to get a handle on possible exotic decays as they will help narrow down the various possibilities beyond the sm .",
    "a particularly interesting example is the exotic decay of the observed sm - like higgs @xmath17 with a light cp - odd higgs @xmath8 .",
    "many beyond the sm scenarios are constructed by extending the higgs sector - well known examples are the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , next to minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite and two - higgs doublet models ( 2hdm)@xcite .",
    "in addition to the sm - like higgs boson in these models , there are other cp - even higgses , cp - odd higgses , as well as charged ones .",
    "other than the decay of those extra higgses into the sm - final states @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which have been the focus of the current higgs searches , the decay of heavy higgses into light higgses , or higgs plus gauge boson could also be sizable . in this study , we explore the decay of @xmath6 or @xmath5 , with @xmath18 and @xmath8 referring to the cp - even and cp - odd higgs respectively . in generic 2hdm or nmssm ,",
    "both decays @xmath19 and @xmath20 could appear with large branching fractions  @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 could also have a sizable cross - section in the low @xmath22 region of the mssm with the light cp - even @xmath23 being sm - like @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we study the process @xmath10 for @xmath11 , @xmath12 , exploring the exclusion bounds as well as discovery reach at the lhc for various combinations of @xmath9 . for simplicity",
    ", we use @xmath5 to refer to both types of decays . since we do not make use of angular correlations , the results obtained for @xmath5 apply to @xmath6 as well with the values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 switched .",
    "details of our analysis can be found in ref .",

    "we study the dominant gluon fusion higgs production @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 . the dominant sm backgrounds for @xmath32 final states are @xmath33 with leptonic @xmath34 decay , @xmath35 with leptonically decaying top quarks , @xmath36 , and @xmath37  @xcite .",

    "those backgrounds either have small production cross sections , or can be sufficiently suppressed by the cuts imposed .",
    "we use madgraph 5/madevent v1.5.11 @xcite to generate our signal and background events .",
    "these events are passed to pythia v2.1.21 @xcite to simulate initial and final state radiation , showering and hadronization .",
    "the events are further passed through delphes 3.07 @xcite with the snowmass combined lhc detector card @xcite to simulate detector effects .    for the signal process",
    ", we generated event samples at 14 tev lhc for @xmath28 with the daughter particle mass fixed at @xmath44200 , 125 , and 50 gev while varying the parent particle mass @xmath24 in the range 150 @xmath16 600 gev .",
    "we applied the following cuts to identify the signal from the backgrounds background . however , including pile - up effects introduces @xmath45 in the signal events , which renders the cut inefficient .",

    "the two masses are correlated , i.e. , if we underestimate @xmath56 we also underestimate @xmath57 . to take this into account",
    "we apply a two - dimensional cut : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the width for the dijet mass window .",
    "note that the slightly shifted reconstructed higgs mass @xmath56 ( 0.95 @xmath25 instead of @xmath25 ) is due to the reconstruction of the @xmath46-jet with a small size of @xmath52=0.5 .",
