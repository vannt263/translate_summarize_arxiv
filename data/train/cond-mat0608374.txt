    "@xcite in mesoscopic systems of semiconductor heterostructures , however , the macroscopic soi results from the asymmetry of the microscopic crystal field and may appear in different forms depending on the materials and structures involved . in materials with asymmetric crystal structure , the cubic dresselhaus soi term exists in bulk materials while an extra linear dresselhaus soi ( dsoi ) term appears in confined , low - dimensional systems due to the change of the crystal structure along the direction of the confinement . in systems with asymmetric confinement , the rashba soi ( rsoi ) term results from a non - vanishing confining electric field as well as from various other soi mechanisms such as the one related to differing band discontinuities at the heterostructure interfaces considered in * k.p * models .",

    "in the two - terminal configuration , the transmission depends on the interference between electrons propagating through the ring s two arms and the transmission properties through the two junctions connecting the ring and the leads . in general",
    ", a symmetric junction can be described by a @xmath5 scattering matrix with the transmission through each arm as a parameter .",

    "we studied the electron energy spectrum and transmission through mesoscopic rings , in a tilted magnetic field , in the presence of the rashba ( rsoi ) and dresselhaus ( dsoi ) terms of the spin - orbit interaction due to the confinement along the perpendicular and radial direction .",
    "we solved exactly the one - electron schrdinger equation and obtained the spectrum and the ac phase including the zeeman term .",
    "this was followed by the formulation of the transmission problem , using a spin - dependent version of griffith s boundary conditions , with the zeeman term treated by perturbation theory .",
    "we evaluated the electron transmission through one ring or a series of rings as a function of the soi strengths @xmath4 , @xmath72 , the orientations @xmath162 and @xmath164 of the corresponding fields , and the orientation @xmath180 of the magnetic field for various parameters .",
    "as all figures demonstrate , the transmission shows a rich nontrivial structure with well - pronounced gaps as a function of any of these variables . for a series of rings these gaps",

    "we also studied the case with the soi present only in one arm of the ring(s ) and saw how the oscillation pattern in the transmission changes due to the changes in the ac phase .",
    "if we change the parameters from one ring to another in a series of rings , we can further modulate the transmission versus the soi strength , cf .",

    "8 , the transmission is identical for any _ odd _ number of rings .",
    "if the number of rings is _ even _ , the transmission vanishes at the same points as that for one ring and otherwise takes the highest constant value .",
    "a simple explanation holds for @xmath163 and @xmath187 @xcite .",
    "we confirmed numerically that this holds in our much more complicated case .",
