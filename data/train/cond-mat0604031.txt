    "oxide systems possessing k@xmath0nif@xmath3 and related structures have been extensively studied owing to their interesting structural , magnetic , and electrical properties .",
    "recently , it was discovered that sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 , a noncuprate member of @xmath7o@xmath3 family , exhibits  @xcite superconductivity at 0.93 k. this report has naturally provoked many researchers to study the similarity and the dissimilarity between the superconductivity in this compound and that in the well - known la@xmath0cuo@xmath3 with the same crystal structure , but a much higher @xmath8 [ ref . 2 ] .",
    "the technique of substituting cu by impurity ions in la@xmath0cuo@xmath3 has been successfully used as a powerful probe to reveal the unconventional properties of this cuprate .",
    "@xcite similarly , various attempts have been made with sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 by replacing ru by ir [ ref .",
    "4 ] , fe [ ref . 5 ] and",
    "6 ] ions , in order to investigate the effect of cationic substitutions .",
    "nonmagnetic impurities are known to induce local moments and suppress @xmath8 severely  @xcite and therefore , replacement of ru@xmath9 ( 4@xmath10 ) ions by nonmagnetic ti@xmath9 ( 3@xmath11 ) ions is an interesting topic of study .",
    "the synthesis of these doped ruthenates is relatively easy , since the ti@xmath9 ion has the same oxidation state , coordination number as well as very similar ionic radius when compared with ru@xmath9 .",
    "in fact , the compound sr@xmath0tio@xmath3 is iso - structural with sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 with very similar lattice parameters , making the substitution facile .",
    "it has been reported  @xcite that the ti@xmath9 impurity indeed suppresses the superconductivity and induces localized moments even for very low ti concentration , @xmath4 @xmath120.03 in sr@xmath0ru@xmath1ti@xmath2o@xmath3 . during the past few years",
    ", a few reports have appeared  @xcite investigating ti doped sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 system ; all these studies focus on the limit of very low ti doping .",
    "interestingly , sr@xmath0ru@xmath1ti@xmath2o@xmath3 is also expected to show a metal to insulator transition as a function of ti doping , because the two end members possess widely different electrical properties with sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 being a paramagnetic metal and sr@xmath0tio@xmath3 being a band insulator . however , there are only few reports on the full series ( 0 @xmath13 1 , in sr@xmath0ru@xmath1ti@xmath2o@xmath3 ) of compounds  @xcite investigating the transport properties , while no detailed electronic structure study has been reported to date .",
    "these transport studies reveal that there is a strong anisotropy between the interlayer resistivity ( @xmath14 ) and in - plane resistivity ( @xmath15 ) , observed in single crystal sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite @xmath14 of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 shows pure metallic conductivity below 130 k and nonmetallic @xmath16  /  @xmath17  @xmath12  0 at higher temperatures .",
    "however , the metal - nonmetal crossover temperature decreases with increasing @xmath4 ( ti concentration ) and for @xmath4=0.2 , @xmath14 never enters a metallic regime .",

    "therefore , all these observations indicate the occurrence of a metal to insulator transition ( mit ) as a function of ti doping in this ruthenate series , the critical composition being close to @xmath4=0.2 .    in order to understand the electronic structure and thereby the nature of the mit in this series ,",
    "we have carried out a detailed high - energy spectroscopic study on sr@xmath0ru@xmath1ti@xmath2o@xmath3 for @xmath4=0.0 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.5 and 0.6 , employing x - ray photoelectron ( xp ) , ultraviolet photoelectron ( up ) , and bremsstrahlung isochromat ( bi ) spectroscopies ( s ) .",
    "these experimental studies , supplemented by band structure calculations for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 and sr@xmath0tio@xmath3 , using an _ ab initio _ self - consistent linearized - muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method within the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) , establish the importance of coulomb correlation effects in understanding metal insulator transition as a function of ti concentration , which can only be analyzed in terms of mott transition .",
    "all electron spectroscopic studies reported here were carried out on polycrystalline samples which were synthesized by the conventional ceramic route .",
    "stoichiometric quantities of high purity srco@xmath18 and the respective transitional metal oxides were thoroughly ground and the mixture was heated at 600  @xmath19c for 24 h to avoid ru evaporation , then at 930  @xmath19c for 24 h , then at 1050  @xmath19c for 24 h , and finally at 1200  @xmath19c for 36 h with intermittent grindings .",

    "the samples were mounted on copper stubs using ultrahigh vacuum ( uhv ) compatible resins , while the electrical contact of the sample with the instrument ground was maintained using uhv compatible ag paste .",
    "the pressure of the experimental chamber was better than 5  @xmath21  10@xmath22 mbar during the experiment and the sample surface was cleaned _ in situ _ by mechanical scraping using an alumina file until the various core levels ( o 1@xmath23 and sr 3@xmath24 ) showed reproducible spectral features and also the intensity of adventitious c 1@xmath23 peak was reduced to a minimum .",
    "all experiments were performed at room temperature .",
    "the binding energy of all spectral features were calibrated to the instrument fermi level which was determined by recording the fermi edge region from a clean silver sample .",
    "self - consistent lmto - asa calculations were performed for stoichiometric sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 and sr@xmath0tio@xmath3 in the experimentally determined tetragonal structure with seven atoms per unit cell and with 128 @xmath25 points in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone .",
    "the lattice parameters used for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 are @xmath26=@xmath27=3.8603   and @xmath28=12.729   ( ref .",
    "13 ) and for sr@xmath0tio@xmath3 are @xmath26=@xmath27 = 3.88   and @xmath28=12.6   ( ref .",
    "in fig . 1(a ) , we show the spectral region for ru 3@xmath29 and ti 2@xmath29 core levels for these compounds . for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 ( _ i.e _ , @xmath4=0 sample ) , we observe a doublet feature with peaks at 463.8 ev for ru 3@xmath30 and 486.4 ev for ru 3@xmath31 core level spectra with a spin - orbit splitting of 22.6 ev .",
    "weak satellite features are also seen at around 476.5 and 499 ev , corresponding to main ru 3@xmath30 and 3@xmath31 features , respectively .",
    "a new distinct peak appears next to the ru 3@xmath30 peak at 458 ev , gaining intensity monotonically with increasing ti doping in sr@xmath0ru@xmath1ti@xmath2o@xmath3 ; this is identified as the ti 2@xmath30 signal .",
    "the spin - orbit splitting in 2@xmath29 level of tio@xmath0  [ ref.15 ] is around 5.7 ev , therefore , ti 2@xmath31 signal appears at around 463.7 ev binding energy , overlapping the ru 3@xmath30 signal . in order to investigate the ti 2@xmath29 core level spectral features without the overlapping ru 3@xmath29 core level signal , we used the ru 3@xmath29 signal from the sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 ( @xmath4=0 ) sample as the reference spectrum for ru 3@xmath29 spectral shape for all the compounds .",
    "the basic idea is to remove the ru 3@xmath29 contribution from the spectral region in fig .",
    "1(a ) by subtracting the reference ru 3@xmath29 spectrum , obtained from the parent undoped sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 , after a proper multiplicative normalization ; thus extracted ti 2@xmath29 spectra are shown for all @xmath4@xmath320 in fig .",
    "resulting ti 2@xmath30 and 2@xmath31 peaks appear at 458 and 463.7 ev binding energies , with the expected spin - orbit splitting of 5.7 ev for a ti@xmath9 species .",
    "moreover it is well known that ti@xmath9 oxides , as in srtio@xmath18  [ ref .",
    "16 ] or tio@xmath0  [ refs .",
    "15 , 16 ] , show weak satellite features , at about 13 ev away from the main peak in the ti 2@xmath29 spectral region , characteristic of the ti@xmath9 state . in the present case",
    ", we can see similar weak satellite features at about 13 ev above the main peaks in the extracted ti 2@xmath29 spectra , [ marked by arrows in fig .",
    "this confirms that ti is in the formally ti@xmath9 3@xmath33 state in this family of compounds , establishing this as a homovalent substituted ( ti@xmath9 in place of ru@xmath9 ) family of compounds .",
    "it is important to note here that such homovalent substitutions leave the electronic configuration of ru sites essentially unchanged , in contrast to more usual hetrovalent substitutions ( e.g. , sr@xmath34 in place of la@xmath35 ) leading to a doping of charge carriers into the system .    in fig .",
    "2 , we show the calculated density of states ( dos ) of the two end members , namely , sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 and sr@xmath0tio@xmath3 . in the upper panel [ fig .",
    "2(a ) ] , we show the total dos along with the ru @xmath24 , o @xmath29 , sr @xmath24 , and sr @xmath23 partial dos for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3",
    ". the total dos has a finite value at @xmath36 , consistent with the metallic property of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 .",
    "the occupied part of the dos is dominated by o @xmath29 and ru @xmath24 states .",
    "significant amounts of o @xmath29 states extend down to about -7.8 ev with three distinct groups of features , namely , those between -3.5 and -7.8 ev , between -1.7 and -3 ev and very close to the fermi energy .",
    "the ru @xmath24 states are found to spread over the complete valence band range down to -7.8 ev .",
    "the feature near -6 ev is contributed by the bonding o @xmath29 states with ru @xmath24 states .",
    "the most intense feature around -2.5 ev in the total dos corresponds to primarily o 2@xmath29 states nonbonding with respect to ru - o interactions and therefore , with a negligible contribution from ru states .",
    "ru ions in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 remains in the low - spin configuration ( 4@xmath10 : @xmath37 ) because of a strong crystal field effect  @xcite splitting the @xmath38 and the @xmath39 levels significantly .",
    "therefore , it has been shown that the states at @xmath36 arises from the antibonding ru @xmath40(@xmath41 ) and o @xmath42 states having four electron occupancy in these triply degenerate bands .",
    "@xcite the unoccupied dos between 0 and 3.5 ev is dominated by ru @xmath24 @xmath38-derived states , while the states around 7 ev is contributed mainly by sr @xmath24 related states .",
    "all the features above 10 ev in the unoccupied dos are mainly contributed by sr @xmath23 and @xmath29 states along with o @xmath23 states .    the calculated band structure for sr@xmath0tio@xmath3 is shown in fig .",
    "it exhibits a clear gap between the occupied and the unoccupied states , in agreement with the observed insulating property of the compound , in contrast to the metallic state of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 . the fermi level in fig .",
    "2(b ) has been aligned at the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "the calculation indicates a band gap of 1.3 ev .",
    "expectedly , the occupied part of the band is completely dominated by the o @xmath29 states with small contributions from sr @xmath24 and ti @xmath24 states , consistent with the idea of a formal ti@xmath9 ( @xmath11 ) valence state in the compound .",
    "the ti @xmath24 level has some occupancy arising from the hybridization of ti @xmath24 states with the o @xmath29 states .",
    "the feature centered at about -5 ev in the total dos is found to have significant contributions from such hybridized ti @xmath24 states along with the dominant o @xmath29 contributions .",
    "the features around -3 ev are primarily from an admixture of o @xmath29 and sr @xmath24 states . the first part ( 0 to 2.7 ev ) of the unoccupied density of states",
    "is completely dominated by ti @xmath24 states of @xmath39 symmetry , while the ti @xmath38 states appear between 2.5 and 7.5 ev , strongly admixed with a contribution from sr @xmath24 states . the features above 12 ev has contributions from sr @xmath23 , o @xmath23 , and ti @xmath29 states .",
    "the experimental xps valence band spectra from all the samples are shown in fig .",
    "the overall spectral features of the valence band are similar for all the compounds , though there are some systematic variations in the relative intensities as well as in spectral details of different features .",
    "the xp spectra exhibit two broad features with peaks at about 1.5 and 5.7 ev binding energies , respectively .",
    "the broad feature centered near 5.7 ev binding energy is easily seen to be due to primarily o @xmath29 bonding states for all compositions ; this is evident from the fact that both sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 and sr@xmath0tio@xmath3 have o @xmath29 dos over this energy range ( see fig .",
    "the spectral intensity of the 1.5 ev feature decreases monotonically with increasing ti doping .",
    "an intensity decrease of certain parts over the occupied states is indeed to be expected in view of a progressive substitution of ru@xmath9 4@xmath10 state by ti@xmath9 3@xmath11 state with an increasing @xmath4 in this series . a comparison with the band structure results of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 [ see fig .",
    "2(a ) ] reveals that the spectral feature with the peak at  1.5 ev is mainly contributed by o @xmath29 nonbonding states over the higher energy between 1.5 and 3.5 ev binding energy and the antibonding ru @xmath40-o @xmath42 states at a lower energy near the fermi level . in the case of sr@xmath0tio@xmath3 ,",
    "on the other hand , a gap opens up near @xmath36 over the energy window where ru 4@xmath24 states are found in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 , due to the 3@xmath11 configuration of the ti@xmath9 in contrast to 4@xmath10 configuration of ru@xmath9 .",
    "the o @xmath29 nonbonding contributions in sr@xmath0tio@xmath3 appear around 1.52 ev binding energy as also in the case of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 .",
    "therefore , with increasing ti concentration , the ru - o antibonding states close to fermi energy are progressively removed , resulting in a decrease in the overall spectral intensity in the 02 ev binding energy region , as observed in the experimental spectra .",
    "while such considerations provide an understanding of the overall decrease in the spectral intensity within the first 2 ev of the fermi energy with increasing @xmath4 , these fail to explain a more interesting , though subtle , aspect of the spectral change .",
    "first we note that the spectral intensity at @xmath36 is substantial for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 , as is evident in fig .",
    "3 , consistent with its metallic ground state .",
    "it is also evident from the figure that there is negligible intensity at @xmath36 for @xmath4=0.6 , also consistent with its insulating ground state , thereby capturing the change in the electronic structure associated with the experimentally observed metal - insulator transition .",
    "however , it is clear that the previous discussion indicating a decrease in the spectral intensity will invariably suggest a finite intensity at the @xmath36 , proportional to the ru content .",
    "in other words , the naive description of an overall decrease of the ru 4@xmath24 associated spectral intensity and the associated changes in the electronic structure can not explain the absence of any spectral intensity at @xmath36 for any finite @xmath4 less than 1 and therefore , such an approach can not explain the metal - insulator transition at a fractional @xmath4 value in this series .",
    "we note that the spectral behavior in the near @xmath36 region suggests the formation of a gap even at a finite ru concentration ; such a gap formation is well known in the context of insulating transition metal compounds , driven by coulomb interactions . however , a poor instrumental resolution in xps precludes any careful investigation of the gap formation as a function of @xmath4 in these spectra .",
    "this issue will be discussed in greater detail at a later stage , making use of the higher resolution in up spectra .",
    "however , we note here that the correlation effect in this ru 4@xmath24 band system has been shown  @xcite to be unexpectedly strong and can not be ignored .",
    "changes in the electronic structure near the fermi edge region are most directly responsible for the metal - insulator transition in any system and therefore , this spectral region is the most important one to understand the nature of the mit in this series of compounds .",
    "we have carefully studied the narrow spectral region close to the fermi energy for all the samples , using he i ups , in view of its much better energy resolution .",
    "the set of he i narrow scan spectra , emphasizing the changes in the electronic structure close to the fermi energy , is shown in fig .",
    "all the spectra are normalized at 2.8 ev binding energy , because this intensity is almost completely derived from o 2@xmath29 nonbonding states which remain invariant with ti doping .",
    "we observe nearly the same intensity for all the spectra at about 2 ev binding energy ; these spectral features are primarily contributed by nonbonding o @xmath29 states ( see fig .",
    "2 ) providing an explanation for the near constancy of this spectral feature across the series .",
    "the regular decrease in spectral intensity with increasing ti concentration in the 0 to 2 ev energy region is evident from the figure ; this is essentially due to the substitution of the ru@xmath9 @xmath10 with ti@xmath9 @xmath11 configuration with increasing @xmath4 , decreasing the total electron count . but more interestingly , we observe a very substantial gap ( @xmath430.10.2 ev ) opening at @xmath36 for @xmath440.2 compounds , thereby clearly signalling the metal - insulator transition , consistent with reports  @xcite based on transport measurements .",
    "we have also probed the evolution of the unoccupied states as a function of ti doping using bi spectroscopy .",
    "the experimental bi spectra , shown in fig . 5 ,",
    "exhibit three broad features with peaks at 1.8 , 10 , and 17 ev .",
    "the spectra clearly exhibit finite dos at @xmath36 for @xmath4=0 and 0.1 compounds ; interestingly , the spectral intensity at @xmath36 vanishes for @xmath440.2 , thereby defining an energy gap and an insulating state , consistent with the valence band results , discussed above .",
    "the feature extending from @xmath36 up to about 5 ev decreases in intensity systematically with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "this can be understood by considering the cross section of different states .",
    "it is known  @xcite that the cross section of ru 4@xmath24 states is almost 100 times that of ti 3@xmath24 states at an excitation energy of 1486.6 ev , employed in the present study .",
    "therefore , spectra in the 03 ev range are dominated by ru 4@xmath24 states , with only minor contributions from ti 3@xmath24 states ; this immediately explains the experimental observation of decreasing intensity of the leading spectral feature with increasing ti doping in place of ru .",
    "in contrast to the clear and systematic change in the spectral feature close to @xmath36 , the higher energy features remain almost identical with changing ti concentration .",
    "this is not surprising , as the band structure results indeed show that the features above 6 ev are dominated by o and sr states , which are essentially the same for both sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 and sr@xmath0tio@xmath3 .",
    "while all these spectroscopic results , establishing a metal - insulator transition , are consistent with transport properties ,  @xcite these spectroscopic results provide some critical inputs in understanding the possible mechanism responsible for this mit , clearly making several other alternative mechanisms untenable .",
    "though the mechanism of the mit in this system has hardly been discussed in the literature so far , our results , for example , clearly suggest that the mit in this system can not be understood in terms of percolation or any other inhomogeneous model , with the assumption that the doping of ti in place of ru in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 does not result in homogeneously doped samples , but only some inhomogeneous physical mixtures of the end compositions , namely , sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 and sr@xmath0tio@xmath3 .",
    "according to such a description , increasing ti concentration should gradually increase the concentration of sr@xmath0tio@xmath3 at the cost of metallic sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 and consequently , a gradual reduction in the intensity of the spectral feature at @xmath36 with increasing ti doping , is expected .",
    "more importantly , the spectra for even the insulating range of compounds with @xmath440.2 are expected to exhibit finite spectral weight at @xmath36 , contributed by the large metallic fraction present in the inhomogeneous system representing a mixture of metallic and insulating phases .",
    "evidently , this is not observed experimentally where a finite and substantial gap is found to appear in the spectral weight near @xmath36 with only 20% ti doping .",
    "specifically , the changes in the lattice parameters between the end members [ for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 @xmath26=@xmath27=3.8603   and @xmath28=12.729   ( ref . 13 ) and for sr@xmath0tio@xmath3 @xmath26=@xmath27=3.88   and @xmath28=12.6   ( ref .",
    "14 ) ] are not large enough to make any perceptible change in the various hopping strengths that contribute to the bandwidth .",
    "therefore , the only significant change in the bandwidth will be due to the decrease in the average coordination number by 20% at the same level of doping .",
    "since the bandwidth is linearly proportional to the coordination number within a tight binding model , we may expect a decrease of about 20% in the ru 4@xmath24 bandwidth from this homovalent substitution .",
    "another possible mechanism for the mit is the disorder driven anderson transition arising from random replacement of ru ions by ti in the sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 lattice .",
    "it is indeed true that the extent of disorder is expected to increase with increasing ti concentration at least until the point of 50% doping .",
    "such disorder driven metal - insulator transition is likely to be signalled by a finite spectral weight at @xmath36 , since the anderson - type transitions are characterized by finite , but localized , density of states at @xmath36 . in presence of long range coulomb interactions such",
    "a system may even open up a soft gap , namely , coulomb gap .",
    "@xcite electron spectroscopic investigations have indeed revealed  @xcite a host of interesting spectroscopic features associated with disorder effects in substituted transition metal compounds . however , the experimental observation of a substantial hard gap in the present case is clearly not compatible with ideas concerning a disorder - driven mit .",
    "the electronic configuration of ru@xmath9 ( 4@xmath10 ) ion in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 is low - spin .",
    "while a strong crystal field would split the @xmath24 levels into @xmath39 and @xmath38 states , the jahn - teller distortion in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 with an elongation of the ruo@xmath45 octahedra along the @xmath46-axis further splits the triply degenerate @xmath39 level , leading to a stabilization of the doubly degenerate @xmath47 , @xmath48 bands with respect to the @xmath49 band .",
    "if this effect is very strong , the system could go into an insulating state with a fully filled doubly degenerate @xmath47 , @xmath48 band .",
    "however the extent of distortion is not very severe in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 and the spread of the @xmath49 band is wide enough to overlap with the @xmath50 band .",
    "@xcite as a consequence , the system remains metallic in spite of the modest jahn - teller distortion .",
    "doping with ti would certainly narrow the ru bandwidth ; however , this effect is not expected to be large enough to remove the overlap of the @xmath49 band with the @xmath48 and @xmath47 bands altogether for as little as 20% ti doping .",
    "it has been already reported  @xcite that the electron correlation effect is not negligible in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath3 in spite of the broad ru 4@xmath24 band .",
    "therefore , the physical properties of these compounds are controlled by the relative strengths of on - site coulomb interaction energy @xmath51 and the bandwidth @xmath52 . in the limit of @xmath51 being significantly less than @xmath52 , the system is metallic , while a progressive reduction in @xmath52 can drive a metal to insulator transition in a system with integral @xmath24 occupancy .",
    "we believe that this system is another example of such a bandwidth controlled mit , in contrast to any band - filling controlled physics in spite of its obvious composition - driven change .",
    "our core level study has shown that ti retains its stable 4 + oxidation state throughout the series ; as a consequence , the ru ions throughout the series has an integral filling with 4@xmath10 electronic configuration .",
    "random replacement of ru ions by ti ions has two distinct effects on the electron motion .",
    "effects of disorder in such a case will definitely be present ; however , as discussed above , it can not explain the mit .",
    "the second , and more important , consequence of the substitution in the present context is to reduce the ru - ru coordination ; this evidently leads to decrease in the ru 4@xmath24 bandwidth .",
    "such a progressive reduction in @xmath52 with increasing ti concentration may lead to the value of @xmath53 to cross the critical value for the metal - insulator transition leading to the insulating state with a finite mott - hubbard gap at the fermi energy .",
    "this description of the mit appears to be the only one compatible with all the experimental observations presented here .    in conclusion",
    ", we have investigated the electronic structure of sr@xmath0ru@xmath1ti@xmath2o@xmath3 with @xmath4=0.0 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.5 , and 0.6 using x - ray and ultraviolet photoemission spectra and high - energy bremsstrahlung isochromat spectra in conjunction with _",
    "_ _ initio _ band structure results .",
    "core level spectra establish that substituted ti remains in the ti@xmath9 state throughout the series , ensuring a ru@xmath9 4@xmath10 with integral ru 4@xmath24 occupancy per ru site .",
    "spectra from the occupied and unoccupied parts show the formation of a gap ( @xmath43200 mev ) at the fermi energy for samples with ti content , @xmath4  @xmath54  0.2 , establishing a metal - insulator transition . these available results can only be understood in terms of a bandwidth controlled metal - insulator transition as a function of the composition , arising from a decreasing ru - ru coordination with increasing ti content .",
