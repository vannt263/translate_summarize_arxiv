    "over the last decade , deep pencil beam  surveys of high - redshift galaxies have been the observational basis for studying the processes that drive galaxy formation and evolution . for a given amount of observing time ,",
    "such surveys have to trade off imaging area and imaging depth : among hst imaging surveys , gems @xcite , aegis @xcite and cosmos @xcite are examples that aim at comparatively wide fields to observe a large sample of galaxies .",
    "alternatively , the hubble deep field ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hdf ) and the ultra deep field ( * ? ? ?",
    "* udf ) are examples of extremely deep surveys in small areas , aimed at detecting faint galaxies ( which can be either of low mass or at high redshift ) .",
    "one of the most fundamental properties of galaxy sub - populations at any epoch is their number density .",
    "however , observational estimates of galaxy number densities in finite volumes are subject to uncertainty due to _ cosmic variance _ , arising from underlying large - scale density fluctuations and leading to uncertainties in excess of nave poisson errors .",
    "note that this source of uncertainty is referred to as sample variance   in other branches of cosmology . for sampling volumes much larger than the typical clustering scale of the observed objects ,",
    "cosmic variance is not significant .",
    "however , many important existing surveys have a sampling volume that is small enough that cosmic variance may dominate the uncertainties .",
    "this may be particularly true at high redshift , where galaxies are expected to be much more strongly clustered than dark matter @xcite .",
    "still , many published quantities which are based on number density ( e.g. luminosity functions , stellar mass functions , etc . )",
    "are quoted with error budgets that do not properly account for cosmic variance .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the normalization and the slope of high - redshift luminosity functions can be affected by cosmic variance errors .",
    "sound estimates of cosmic variance are helpful both for analyzing existing observational data and for designing future surveys . for a detailed and general treatment of the cosmic error",
    ", we refer to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our goal here is to provide a simple recipe to derive cosmic variance for galaxy samples selected by their stellar mass @xmath3 , for a field of specified angular dimensions @xmath14 and @xmath15 , at a mean redshift @xmath1 and for a redshift bin size of @xmath2 .",
    "several previous works have provided estimates of cosmic variance for specific sets of assumptions .",
    "for example , @xcite presented estimates of the cosmic variance as a function of field area and axis ratio for the redshift range @xmath16 , relevant to the deep2 redshift survey , but did not account for galaxy bias ( the clustering amplitude of galaxies relative to dark matter ; see eqn.[eqn : bias ] ) .",
    "@xcite provided predictions that could be used to estimate cosmic variance as a function of mean redshift and survey volume , using the number density of the population to estimate the bias , assuming one galaxy per halo .",
    "however , @xcite used the approximation of spherical ( rather than rectangular or pencil beam ) volumes .",
    "@xcite presented estimates of cosmic variance for pencil beam geometries , again using the number density of the population to estimate the host halo mass and hence the bias .",
    "many galaxy samples in observational studies , however , are selected by their stellar mass , and stellar mass is one of the fundamental properties of galaxies .",
    "galaxy clustering and bias are strong functions of stellar mass , making it extremely important to account for the mass dependence in cosmic variance estimates .",
    "moreover , one does not necessarily know the number density of a population of interest a priori .",
    "we therefore take a different approach here , providing estimates of cosmic variance explicitly as a function of stellar mass and redshift . to do this , we make use of the results previously presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* m09 ) . we used a halo occupation distribution ( hod ) model to empirically establish the relationship between stellar mass and dark matter halo ( or sub - halo ) mass at different redshifts , and then used a dissipationless n - body simulation to compute the galaxy bias as a function of stellar mass and redshift .",
    "we presented fitting functions for this quantity in m09 .",
    "we combine these with estimates of the cosmic variance for the dark matter for rectangular cells as described in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : method ] we describe how to define and how to compute cosmic variance for a galaxy population , based on the underlying cold dark matter ( cdm ) theory , a model for galaxy bias and for a combination of separate survey fields . in section [ sec : recipe ] we spell out a recipe to compute cosmic variance for a pencil beam geometry in four steps : ( 1 ) select survey geometry , ( 2 ) choose mean redshift and redshift bin size , ( 3 ) determine stellar mass interval and ( 4 ) compute cosmic variance .",
    "we also apply this recipe to four existing surveys at a redshift of @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in section [ sec : properties ] we compare cosmic variance for different galaxy samples at different redshifts and different survey geometries .",
    "finally , we summarize our methods and conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .    throughout , we assume cosmological parameters consistent with results from wmap-3 @xcite for a flat @xmath19 cosmological model : matter density @xmath20 , cosmological constant @xmath21 , hubble parameter @xmath22 , fluctuation amplitude @xmath23 and primordial power - spectrum @xmath24 .",
    "all stellar masses are calibrated to a @xcite initial mass function .",
    "the mean @xmath25 and the variance @xmath26-@xmath27 are given by the first and second moments of the probability distribution @xmath28 , which describes the probability of counting @xmath29 objects within a volume @xmath30 .",
    "the relative cosmic variance is defined as @xmath31 the last term in the numerator represents the correction for poisson shot noise .",
    "the second moment of the object counts is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the two - point correlation function of the sample and @xmath30 is the sample volume ( see * ? ? ?",
    "234 ) . combining this with equation",
    ", the cosmic variance can be written as @xmath34    there are two approaches to evaluating this equation .",
    "the first is applicable to populations with a known correlation function , when the integral can be solved either analytically or numerically as a function of cell radius or cell volume .",
    "however , in practice , there are a number of difficulties with this approach : while on small scales in the nonlinear regime ( @xmath35 ) the correlation function can typically be approximated by a power law , it deviates on larger scales ( in the linear regime ) , from this form .",
    "additionally , in many cases of interest the correlation function is not known a priori .",
    "the second approach to calculating the cosmic variance can be used if the correlation function can not be approximated by a power law or if it is unknown .",
    "it makes use of the galaxy bias , which can be predicted for a given galaxy population using halo occupation models .",
    "we can substitute the galaxy correlation function @xmath36 in equation for the correlation function for dark matter @xmath37 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the galaxy bias , which depends both on redshift @xmath40 , and the stellar mass of the galaxies @xmath3 . in general , the bias is also a function of @xmath41 , however , in the linear regime , we assume that it is independent of scale .",
    "this assumption will be made throughout the paper . employing the bias in this manner yields @xmath42 the integral leading to @xmath43",
    "can then be solved using linear theory in cdm for any volume @xmath30 with a given geometry . the cosmic variance for galaxies",
    "can thus be determined by multiplying the dark matter cosmic variance at a given redshift with the galaxy bias for a given stellar mass at that redshift . for a pencil beam geometry",
    "the volume element @xmath30 is set by the angular size of the survey and the redshift bin size .",
    "we now pursue this second approach , using the galaxy bias as a function of redshift and stellar mass as computed by @xcite . in this paper",
    "the authors used a halo occupation model to obtain a parameterized stellar - to - halo mass relation by populating halos and subhalos in an @xmath29-body simulation with galaxies and requiring that the observed stellar mass function be reproduced . using the halo positions obtained from the simulation",
    ", they find that predictions for the galaxy correlation function are in excellent agreement with observed clustering properties at low redshift .",
    "the derived stellar - to - halo mass relation is finally used to predict the stellar - mass - dependent galaxy correlation function and bias at high redshift .",
    "we calculate the cosmic variance for dark matter in each redshift bin by solving the integral in eqn   for dark matter using the code quickcv which is described in @xcite .",
    "the code computes the dark matter correlation function using the transfer function given in @xcite and a window function which is 1 inside the volume @xmath30 and 0 elsewhere .",
    "the volume elements are determined by the angular dimensions of the survey field and the redshift bin .",
    "finally , the cosmic variance for galaxies is computed using equation .",
    "once cosmic variance has been determined for a number of individual survey fields that are widely separated on the sky , compared to the correlation length , as is often the case ( e.g. for the various hst survey fields ) , one can easily derive the cosmic variance for the combined sample .",
    "for the combination of fields @xmath44 the total volume is @xmath45 implying a cosmic variance for the total sample of @xmath46 where we have used @xmath47 since the galaxies in separated fields are uncorrelated . for",
    "a pencil beam geometry ( angular extend @xmath48 radian ) this can be written as @xmath49 ^ 2}\\;\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the angular dimensions of each field .",
    "note that this volume - weighted average is identical to an inverse - variance - weighted average only in the range where the cosmic variance scales with volume .",
    "in order to compute the cosmic variance for galaxies in a given volume in the universe one has to fix five parameters . the size of the volume is determined by two dimensions tangential to the line of sight and one dimension parallel to the line of sight .",
    "the tangential dimensions we use are the angular size of the field @xmath14 and @xmath15 , while the vertical dimension is set by the size of the redshift bin under consideration @xmath2 .",
    "the fourth parameter is the mean redshift of the volume @xmath1 , since the cosmic variance depends on the clustering strength which is a function of redshift .",
    "moreover @xmath1 determines the length scale of the volume bins by setting the conversion factor from angular dimensions and @xmath2 into comoving mpc . in order to determine the cosmic variance for galaxies one finally has to fix the stellar mass @xmath3 of the sample under consideration , as the clustering strength and the bias",
    "depend strongly on stellar mass .",
    "thus the five parameters which have to be set are @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .      the first step to calculate",
    "the cosmic variance is to fix the size of the volume element under consideration .",
    "for now we set the size of the redshift bin to a reference value of @xmath50 .",
    "this is a convenient bin size for low redshift while for higher redshift it is rather small .",
    "however , this choice can be changed at any redshift ( for values @xmath51 ) using the recipe presented in section [ sec : redshiftbins ] . for the tangential dimensions , we choose five popular fields : the hubble ultra deep field ( * ? ? ? * udf ) , one field of the great observatories origins deep survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* goods ) , the extended chandra deep field south ( e - cdfs ) used in the galaxy evolution from morphology and seds survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gems ) , the extended groth strip ( egs ) used in the all - wavelength extended groth strip international survey ( * ? ? ? * aegis ) and the field used in the cosmic evolution survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cosmos ) .",
    "the angular dimensions of the surveys and the resulting observation areas are summarized in table [ t : surveyarea ] .",
    "we note that due to the small scales for the udf numerical uncertainties in the integration of the correlation function are likely to be high . as a result",
    "the values for cosmic variance in the udf computed here , especially for @xmath52 ( where size of the volume elements is very small ) have considerable uncertainties . at these scales ,",
    "the assumption of linear biasing is also not accurate . as a consequence",
    "the cosmic variance for the udf presented here is to be treated with caution and is mainly included to demonstrate the large cosmic variance in small fields .",
