    "ngc 891 is one of the most perfect edge - on @xcite spiral galaxies in our neighbourhood .",
    "this peculiarity , and its similarity with the milky way galaxy in hubble type ( sb ) , optical luminosity and rotational velocity @xcite , has allowed it to be intensively studied in order to understand the distribution and the characteristics of the galactic interstellar medium .",
    "it has been widely studied in radio continuum ( _ e.g. _ allen 1978 , dahlem 1994 ) , carbon monoxide ( garca - burillo 1992 , scoville 1993 , sofue & nakai 1993 , garca - burillo & gulin 1995 , sakamoto 1997 ) , atomic hydrogen ( for instance swaters 1997 ) , molecular hydrogen @xcite and optical extinction @xcite .",
    "the dust far - infrared continuum emission has been observed by the iras satellite ( wainscoat 1997 , rice 1988 ) , the 1.3 mm emission by gulin ( 1993 ) , and the submillimetre emission has recently been mapped with scuba at 450 and 850  by alton ( 1998 ) and israel ( 1999 ) . for instance , alton ( 1998 ) showed that the dust submillimetre emission could be fitted by a two - dust component model , assuming a spectral index equal to 2 .",
    "however , this was a fit with zero degree of freedom , thus it needs to be confirmed by including other submillimetre measurements . the accurate knowledge of dust properties in this galaxy , and therefore in other spiral galaxies such as the milky way , needs a better submillimetre spectral coverage , in order to properly derive the dust temperature(s ) and spectral index",
    "this is crucial to derive accurate masses of the interstellar medium in galaxies .    in this article",
    ", we present new results obtained in the submillimetre range with the isophot @xcite instrument on board of esa s infrared space observatory @xcite , and with the pronaos ( programme national dobservations submillimtriques ) balloon - borne telescope .",
    "section 2 presents the observations and data processing , section 3 presents the results obtained , and section 4 presents an analysis of the data set .",
    "pronaos is a french balloon - borne submillimetre experiment .",
    "four bolometers cooled at 0.3 k measure the submillimetre flux with sensitivity to low brightness gradients of about 4 in band 1 ( 200 ) and 0.8 in band 4 ( 580 ) .",
    "the effective wavelengths are 200 , 260 , 360 and 580 , and the angular resolutions are 2@xmath4 in bands 1 and 2 , 2.5@xmath4 in band 3 and 3.5@xmath4 in band 4 .",
    "details about the instrument can be found in ristorcelli ( 1998 ) and lamarre ( 1994 ) .",
    "the data which we analyze here were obtained during the second flight of pronaos in september 1996 , at fort sumner , new mexico .",
    "the data processing and the map - making method , including deconvolution from chopped data , are described in dupac ( 2001 ) . however , for these ngc 891 data , we use a non prior deconvolution method , implemented the same way as the wiener filter in dupac ( 2001 ) . indeed",
    ", these data are quite noisy , so the optimal wiener filter may somehow modify the signal , which is not the case with the non prior map - making method .",
    "then we carefully subtract the background around the galaxy to get the corrected surface brightness , and we smooth the maps of the first three bands with adequate profiles in order to obtain the same angular resolution as the fourth band ( 3.5@xmath4 ) . after having done this , we check the correlation of the pixels in each band with respect to all the other bands in order to detect possible residual offsets between bands .",
    "this happened in band 2 that we rescaled to match the other bands .",
    "the noise fluctuations in the final maps define the spatial relative uncertainty which is 5 mjy / sr at 200 , 4 mjy / sr at 260  and 2 mjy / sr at 360 and 580 .",
    "the intercalibration error between bands is 5 % ( 1 @xmath5 ) , and the absolute calibration uncertainty is 8 % .",
    "ngc 891 has been mapped with isophot using the astronomical observation template pht32 in chopped mapping mode with the c200 array detector ( 2@xmath02 pixels , 92@xmath6 per pixel ) at the reference wavelengths 170 and 200  ( see details in laureijs 2001 ) .",
    "the data have been processed using the isophot interactive analysis software pia v9.1 @xcite .",
    "the data reduction procedure includes ramp linearisation , ramp deglitching , reset interval correction , dark current subtraction , signal linearisation and signal deglitching .",
    "each observation has been bracketted with two measurements of the fine calibration source ( fcs ) . for the flux calibration",
    ", we have used the second fcs .",
    "the first quartile normalisation flat - fielding method has been used as implemented in pia in order to correct for the remaining responsivity differences of the individual detector pixels .",
    "we smooth the derived 1.5@xmath4-resolution maps to 3.5@xmath4 in order to obtain a consistent data set .",
    "the absolute photometric error of isophot is around 20 % .",
    "we use the scuba 450 and 850  flux profiles , as well as the high resolution ( hires ) 60 and 100  flux profiles from the infrared astronomical satellite survey , as published in alton ( 1998 ) .",
    "we smooth the original profiles to the angular resolution of the fourth band of pronaos ( 3.5@xmath4 ) .",
    "the information obtained is presented as intensity profiles along the major axis in fig .",
    "[ ncprofiles ] .",
    "we have checked the photometry of all 3.5@xmath4-resolution maps with respect to all the others , by plotting pixel - pixel diagrams . no noise offset between bands could be detected .",
    "in particular , both 200  bands ( isophot and pronaos ) are in good agreement with each other , which gives a good global consistency to the data set .",
    "all bands of pronaos and isophot show a good symmetry between both sides of the galaxy , which extends approximatively 4@xmath4 away from the centre .",
    "this extension is similar to the one of the scuba maps of alton ( 1998 ) and israel ( 1999 ) .",
    "[ ncprofiles ] shows a large enhancement of the intensities at an angular distance of about 1.5@xmath4 away from the galactic centre along the north - eastern side of the galaxy .",
    "this is clearly visible in the 200 and 260  pronaos bands which have the adequate angular resolution ( 2@xmath4 ) , as well as in both isophot bands .",
    "this enhancement can also be seen ( at the same place ) in the scuba maps presented by alton ( 1998 ) and israel ( 1999 ) .",
    "another enhancement , though less large , is visible at the same angular distance on the other side of the galaxy on scuba maps .",
    "the explanation for these enhancements could be spiral arms or a molecular ring encircling the galactic bulge .    .",
    "the 200 , 260 , 360 and 580  pronaos profiles are respectively plotted as a full line , a dotted line , a dash - dotted line and a dash - dot - dotted line .",
    "the angular resolution is 2@xmath4 in the first two bands , 2.5@xmath4 in the third and 3.5@xmath4 in the fourth . ]",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]    several fitting procedures have been applied to the three spectra displayed in fig .",
    "the usual simple modelization of the large - grain emission is the modified blackbody , which obeys the following equation :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the wavelength , @xmath10 the emissivity of the observed dust column density at @xmath11 , t the temperature of the grains , @xmath7 the spectral index and @xmath12 the planck function .",
    "we fit the data using a one - component modified blackbody model , with and without the 60  point ( which may be contaminated by very small grain emission , see dsert 1990 ) and assuming @xmath7=2 or not .",
    "we also fit the data using a two - component model , assuming @xmath7=2 for both components , which have different temperatures .",

    "[ cols= \" < \" , ]     for calculating the total fluxes ( presented in table [ flu ] ) , we integrate the measurements over the three 3@xmath4 beams along the major axis , which corresponds to 25 kpc . for estimating the mass of the galactic interstellar medium , we follow the simple model described in dupac ( 2001 ) , which uses the dust 100  opacity in the diffuse interstellar medium from dsert ( 1990 ) . in this model ,",
    "the total column density of interstellar medium is simply proportional to @xmath13 , the coefficient being 1.67@xmath010@xmath14 h.@xmath15 .",
    "two mass estimations are made : one assumes a single dust component with the emissivity @xmath13 varying along the major axis as derived by the free-@xmath7 fits without the 60  data ( see table [ fits ] ) ; the other assumes two dust components with varying emissivities as derived by the two - component fits with the 60  data . in either case",
    ", we assume a distance to ngc 891 of 9.5 mpc @xcite .",
    "we find a mass of the interstellar medium of 4.6@xmath010@xmath1 m@xmath2 when applying the one - component free-@xmath7 model , whereas we find 12@xmath010@xmath1 m@xmath2 when applying the two - component model ( including the 60  points ) .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the existence of quite large amounts of cold ( 15.7 k ) dust in the two - component results . the value of 4.6@xmath010@xmath1 m@xmath2 is consistent with previous estimates from gulin ( 1993 ) : 4@xmath010@xmath1 m@xmath2 , and israel ( 1999 ) : 3.9@xmath010@xmath1 m@xmath2 .",
    "we can assume from gulin ( 1993 ) that the atomic hydrogen mass is 2.5@xmath010@xmath1 , which gives a molecular hydrogen amount of 2.1@xmath010@xmath1 m@xmath2 from our measurement ( one - component fit ) .",
    "this is in good agreement with the standard assumption of similar quantities of atomic and molecular gas in spiral galaxies .",
    "however , if we trust the two - component estimation , the molecular to atomic gas ratio becomes 3.8 , which is much larger than standard assumptions .",
    "this amount of molecular gas ( 9.5@xmath010@xmath1 m@xmath2 ) is not in good agreement with the standard estimation from co measurements either , using the co - to - h@xmath16 conversion factor of strong ( 1988 ) : about 4.5@xmath010@xmath1 .",
    "from this two - component modeling , we derive cold over warm component mass ratios for the three studied positions : 19 for the centre , 42 for the north - eastern data point and 34 for the south - western one .",
    "therefore , there is a strong trend to consider that the cold ( 16 k ) dust amount is much larger than the warm dust amount , and that the cold to warm dust ratio is twice larger in the wings of this galaxy than in the centre .",
    "these ratios are smaller than those derived by alton ( 1998 ) with iras and scuba data only , but larger than those derived by israel ( 1999 ) with slightly different temperatures ( cold to warm dust ratio of about 10 ) .    as our isophot and pronaos measurements constrain very well the peak of the spectra , we are confident in the reliability of the derived dust properties ( emissivity , temperature and spectral index ) . however , the different possibilities to fit ( well ) the spectra lead to different estimates of the mass .",
    "if one accepts the possibility that the spectral index of the dust can be somewhat different from 2 , which seems wise to us regarding recent results ( walker 1990 , ristorcelli 1998 , dupac 2001 , dupac 2002 , dupac 2003 , bennett 2003 ) , it does not seem possible to better discriminate between the different fitting procedures given the present data , although the spectral coverage is relatively accurate . also , the @xmath17/n@xmath18 ratio used @xcite is debatable , and the mass estimates are of course very much dependent on this value .",
    "we compare these ism mass estimates to the _ dust _ mass ( 19@xmath010@xmath19 ) of ngc 891 obtained by alton ( 2000 ) , assuming given values for the grain radius and density .",
    "this is substantially less than the estimation of 50@xmath010@xmath19 from alton ( 1998 ) , who used a two - component model of the submillimetre emission . comparing the alton ( 2000 ) dust mass to our ism mass estimates , we obtain a gas to dust mass ratio of 240 for the one - component mass estimate and 640 for the two - component one .",
    "the first estimate of this ratio is slightly less than that derived by alton ( 2000 ) : 260 , a bit closer to the milky way value and well in agreement with the canonical dependence on the metallicity @xcite . if we compare the ism mass estimate from our two - component model ( 12@xmath010@xmath1 ) to the two - component model estimate from alton ( 1998 ) : 50@xmath010@xmath19 , then the gas to dust ratio is ( also ) 240 .",
    "we therefore consider that this value is somewhat robust .",
    "we have presented pronaos and isophot data of the ngc 891 spiral galaxy , together with iras and scuba measurements .",
    "the overall submillimetre spectrum of this object is now well constrained , and two different conclusions can be derived : either one single dust component is fitted to the spectra ( without the 60  data ) , and in this case the temperature is higher toward the centre of the galaxy than toward the wings , and the spectral index is less steep ( 1.4 in the centre and 1.7 - 2 in the wings ) ; either two components are fitted assuming @xmath7=2 , and this leads to a warm temperature of 29 k and a cold temperature of 16 k. the interstellar medium masses derived by these two methods are quite different , but both are consistent with a gas to dust mass ratio of 240 .",
    "the good spectral coverage of the submillimetre range that we present here makes us rather confident in our determination of the dust emission properties .",
    "however , the way to fit the data , as well as the opacity properties , lead to inevitable uncertainties in the determination of the masses .",
    "a next step in the accurate knowledge of the continuum emission of this galaxy , as well as of other nearby spirals , would be to obtain the same spectral resolution in the same wavelength range with a better angular resolution .",
    "this should allow to better discriminate the number of distinct components , as well as the possible variations of the spectral index , and this should be achieved by forthcoming experiments such as the herschel satellite with the instruments pacs @xcite and spire @xcite .",
