    "for the strong pulsar psr  b0329 + 54 , the high - quality single pulses are easily observable .",
    "we obtained the data at 325  mhz in march 1999 using the giant metrewave radio telescope near pune , and the data at 606 mhz was obtained in august 1996 using the 76-m lovell telescope at jodrell bank . for the analysis , we considered about 2500 single pulses at each frequency .",
    "the time resolutions of data at 325 and 606 mhz were 0.516 and 0.250 ms , respectively .    to estimate the pulse profiles which clearly show the presence of weaker components we developed a ` window - threshold ' technique . in this technique , we set a window in longitude and employ an intensity threshold while considering the single pulses for making average profiles , i.e.  we consider all those pulses , which have intensity levels above the threshold within the window . for threshold",
    "the _ rms _ in intensity was computed from the off - pulse region . in figs .",
    "1a&b we have plotted the average pulse profiles which were obtained by applying this technique to nine component windows . the average profile obtained from all those pulses is plotted in figs .",

    "we have developed a technique based on windowing and thresholding , to detect the weak emission components in pulsar profiles . by applying it to the single pulse data of psr  b0329 + 54 we have detected three new emission components ( vii , viii and ix ) of this pulsar , and also confirmed the presence of a component ( vi ) proposed by kuzmin & izvekova ( 1996 ) .",
    "the near - symmetric distribution of components around the core / centre of the profile , favours the idea that the pulsar emission beam is annular or conal ( oster & sieber 1977 ; rankin 1983 ) .",
    "we thank a. g. lyne for providing the jodrell bank data , and j. m. rankin for useful discussions .",

    "<S> hence our analysis indicates that psr  b0329 + 54 has nine components , which is among the highest of all the known pulsars . </S>",
