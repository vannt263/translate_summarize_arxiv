    "the correlation function is one of the fundamental quantities in searching into the physical origin of the universe . in large - scale redshift surveys , redshifts and spherical positions on the sky of luminous objects",
    "are used for estimating the spatial distribution of mass , but the former is distorted by inhomogeneity of the universe .    two intrinsic distortion effect on the correlation function",
    "originate in the velocity field @xcite and the cosmological warp @xcite .",
    "the former comes from the fact that an observed redshift corresponds to the recession velocity which is composed not only of the expansion of the universe but also of peculiar velocities .",
    "the latter distortion is brought about by the nonlinear mapping of the objects from the expanding curved space on a light cone onto a flat redshift space @xcite .",
    "in addition to those intrinsic distortions , there are secondary distortions which are due to perturbations of light rays . while the redshift is altered by the sachs - wolfe effect @xcite , the spherical position is recast by the gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "although the sachs - wolfe effect is not so important , the gravitational lensing can affect the observable correlation function in forthcoming redshift surveys as this effect is efficient for high - redshift objects @xcite .",
    "the effect of the gravitational lensing on the angular functions @xmath0 have been intensively investigated so far @xcite .",
    "recently , among others , cross correlations of galaxies at different redshifts @xcite are successfully applied to the commissioning data from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , to single out the weak lensing effect .    as for the 3d correlation function in redshift space , a qualitative treatment of the lensing effect",
    "is given in @xcite to estimate the upper limit of the effect , using the phenomenological dyer - roeder distance @xcite .",
    "it is still not clear whether or not the lensing is actually efficient where the intrinsic correlation function is negligible on scales comparable to 100mpc .",
    "the main purpose of this _ letter _ is to give a quantitative treatment of this issue , consistently including velocity and cosmological distortions , and consequently to show the weak lensing actually has detectable effects on 3d correlation function in redshift space when large - scale redshift surveys like sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) are available .",

    "we adopt the unit @xmath11 throughout this letter .    from the first - order einstein equation of the metric in equation ( [ eq2 - 1 ] ) , the density contrast @xmath12 and the velocity field @xmath13 on scales much less than the curvature scale satisfy @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the linear growth rate @xcite .",
    "the laplacian @xmath18 is taken with respect to comoving coordinates .",

    "the conventional redshift @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 , but the actually observed redshift is changed by the line - of - sight peculiar velocity , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a line - of - sight unit vector , and also by the gravitational potential , @xmath25 . from the time - component of the geodesic equation of the light ray , the observed redshift @xmath26 is given by @xcite @xmath27 , \\label{eq2 - 6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we abbreviate the function on a light cone as @xmath28 , and so as @xmath29 .",
    "the integral is performed on the light cone for a fixed direction of line of sight .",
    "now , we consider the small angle approximation so that light rays are confined to a narrow cone around the polar axis , @xmath30 , and introduce new coordinates @xmath31 , @xmath32 , following @xcite . adopting the born approximation ,",
    "the angular components of the geodesic equation reduces to equation for the observed angular components @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) : @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "the apparent luminosity of the light is magnified by a factor @xmath37 is a local convergence field of weak lensing @xcite for a fixed redshift of source object : @xmath38 due to the magnification , the observed apparent magnitude @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 @xcite , where @xmath41 is the apparent magnitude in the absence of lensing .    the magnitude - limited number density in real space @xmath42 and that in observed redshift space @xmath43 are related by the number conservation equation , @xmath44 , while the number density is given by @xmath45n(z;<\\!\\!m)/(4\\pi z^2)$ ] , where @xmath46 is the density contrast and @xmath47 is the magnitude - limited number count per redshift .",
    "evaluating the jacobian , one obtains the relation between @xmath48 and @xmath49 , as well as the relation between density contrasts .",
    "the result contains the terms with @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath25 and their derivatives . for fluctuations on a scale @xmath52 in units of hubble distance ,",

    "the first term of equation ( [ eq2 - 10 ] ) is the real density fluctuations , the second term is the velocity distortion @xcite , and the last term is the effect of weak lensing , which consists of the contribution from the modulation by magnification bias , @xmath68 , and of the alternation of surface density by lensing , @xmath69 . in the following ,",

    "the terms @xmath99 , @xmath99 are zero for @xmath100 in the small angle approximation . the velocity - lensing term",
    ", @xmath101 is explicitly calculated to be zero , which is",
    "because the term @xmath102 only depends on fluctuations along the line of sight which are smoothed out .",
    "if we convolve the above expression of @xmath103 and @xmath104 with a selection function along the line of sight , we obtain the form of angular correlation function with the effect of weak lensing @xcite .",
    "thus the total correlation function in 3d redshift space is given by @xmath105 for @xmath74 and @xmath30 .",
    "the first term dominates on scales much smaller than hubble distance , while the last two terms dominate on scales comparable to the hubble distance along the line of sight .",
    "therefore , even though @xmath106 is valid only for @xmath107 ( distant observer approximation ) , we can use the form @xmath108 even when @xmath109 .    in figure  [ fig1 ] ,",
    "we plot the total correlation function @xmath110 together with each component , @xmath106 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 . with the choice of the cdm - like initial power spectrum @xcite with a shape parameter @xmath111 and a linear amplitude @xmath112",
    ", we use the fitting formula for the fully non - linear power spectrum of @xcite for lensing correlations , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "linear predictions are also plotted in the lower panels .",
    "the nonlinearity of the intrinsic correlation @xmath106 , which is only important for the region @xmath113 , is ignored .",
    "we exemplify the low - density flat model with @xmath114 , @xmath115 . in the upper panels , the slope of the number counts",
    "is assumed as @xmath116 , and the bias factor as @xmath117 , regardless of the redshift .",
    "this example corresponds to @xmath118 and @xmath119 of galaxies as seen in table  [ tab1 ] , in which the slope @xmath65 is calculated from the b - band luminosity function of apm galaxies @xcite , and of quasars @xcite .",
    "the limiting magnitudes assumed in table  [ tab1 ] correspond to estimated sdss redshift data of galaxies and quasars . in practice",
    ", the slope @xmath65 can be observationally determined for individual catalogue of quasar or galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "each component of correlations roughly scales as @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 for other parameters and models .    in the lower panels of figure  [ fig1 ] , the galaxy - galaxy ( g - g ) ,",
    "galaxy - qso ( g - q ) , and qso - qso ( q - q ) correlations are plotted , assuming the sdss slope @xmath65 of table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the bias parameter is set @xmath123 and @xmath124 for galaxies and quasars , respectively .",
    "the line - of - sight separations are large enough in lower panels , so that the intrinsic clustering is negligible .",
    "the absolute value of the intrinsic clustering component @xmath125 is a decreasing function of the line - of - sight separation , @xmath126 , except the vicinity of zero crossings . on the other hand ,",
    "the lens - lens component @xmath104 is almost independent on the separation and the density - lens component @xmath103 is an increasing function .",
    "those behaviors are understood by the fact that the weak lensing is efficient between the object and the observer .",
    "thus , intrinsic clustering component dominates for small separations , while lens - lens and/or density - lens components dominates for large separations along the direction of line of sight .",
    "the lower panels in figure  [ fig1 ] show the region where lensing contribution dominates in the case of the sdss magnitude limits to illustrate the typical magnitude of correlations .",
    "are those lensing signals detectable ?",
    "the statistical uncertainty in estimating the correlation function is given by @xmath127 @xcite , where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are numbers of object in the bin used for redshifts @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively , @xmath132 is the solid angle subtended by the survey area , and @xmath133 is the fraction in the bin used for angle @xmath134 . to increase the signal to noise ratio , it is desirable to use large bins for @xmath134 . to be specific ,",
    "we consider a bin @xmath135 $ ] , and theoretical curves are integrated accordingly , so that @xmath136 $ ] .",
    "the effective scale of this bin is given by @xmath137 for @xmath138 .",
    "in the sdss , @xmath139 } \\sim 1.2 \\pi \\times 10 ^ 7\\ [ \\mbox{arcmin}^2]$ ] , and the estimated numbers of galaxies and quasars are @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively .",
    "assuming we take sufficiently large bins of redshifts ( this choice is similar to considering angular correlation functions ) , the consequent estimates of the statistical error are given by @xmath142 for g - g , @xmath143 for g - q , and @xmath144 for q - q correlations , which are plotted in lower panels .",
    "the s / n ratios turn out to be about @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 for g - g , g - q , and q - q correlations , respectively .",
    "therefore , the weak lensing in 3d correlation function of galaxies in the sdss is definitely detectable , and the detection of galaxy - qso cross - correlation is marginal , while the quasar correlation by lensing is below the noise level in the sdss . in order to detect the qso - qso lensing effect , the sample should be at least 5 times larger than the sdss , or parameters @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath65 should be larger than assumed values .    in summary , we have obtained a theoretical prediction of correlation function in redshift space , taking into account the effect of weak lensing , together with velocity distortions and cosmological distortions on a light - cone .",
    "each effect contributes differently to the correlation function , and is realistically detectable .",
    "our result provides a fundamental link between theoretical models and the observed correlation function in the 3d redshift survey data . besides the determination of the power spectrum itself , various cosmological parameters , especially the bias parameter ,",
    "can be estimated by proper likelihood analyses , including kl transform of the correlation matrix @xcite .",
    "one may also be tempted to assume the cosmological parameters before analysing data . in which case , the error originated in choosing the wrong cosmological model is roughly given by the order of the redshift @xmath64 times the error of cosmological parameters , since the alcock - paczyski effect is roughly proportional to @xmath64 up to @xmath151-@xmath152 .",
