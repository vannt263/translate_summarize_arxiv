    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) vortex physics is strongly reflected in the properties of systems related to 2d superfluids like josephson junction arrays ,  @xcite superconducting films , and @xmath0he films ,  @xcite as well as high-@xmath1 superconductors .",
    "@xcite the vortices are , e.g. , responsible for the well - known kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition  @xcite and there is a fairly good understanding of the thermodynamic properties related to 2d vortex physics . however , the dynamical aspects , which can be probed by the complex impedance and the flux noise measurements in superconductors ,  @xcite and by the torsional oscillator period shift in @xmath0he - films ,  @xcite are much less well understood .",
    "the first attempt to describe the dynamic vortex response phenomenologically was given by ambegaokar - halperin - nelson - siggia ( ahns ) in ref .",
    "however , it was later discovered that the minnhagen phenomenology ( mp ) in ref .   based on essentially the same ingredients as ahns , described experiments and simulations better .",
    "@xcite a particularly interesting aspect in the mp is that it reflects an anomaly in the 2d vortex response ,  @xcite which , for example , in a superconductor takes the form of a logarithmic divergence of the complex conductivity : @xmath2 for small frequency @xmath3 .",
    "there still remain open questions on what ingredients can cause this anomaly and give rise to the anomalous response form .",
    "there has been a number of attempts to obtain the mp form with other phenomenological approaches as well as somewhat formally more rigorous ones .",
    "@xcite one possibility is that it is an intrinsic property of the 2d vortex system which is linked to the long range logarithmic interaction , as presumed by the original motivation for the mp response form .",
    "@xcite another possibility is that it is caused by the coupling between the perpendicular currents described by the vortices and the longitudinal currents ( often referred to as the spin - wave part ) .",
    "@xcite in the present paper we suggest that there is yet another possibility ; the mp type response can also arise from pinning influencing the vortex system .",
    "the approach to this problem , which we subscribe to here , is to systematically investigate various models by aid of simulations .",
    "vortices can be described as 2d coulomb gas particles , in the sense that a vortex with vorticity @xmath4 corresponds to a coulomb gas particle with charge @xmath4 ( see , e.g. , ref .   for details on the mapping between the two models ) .",
    "since the dynamics of the vortices can to a good approximation be described by the langevin dynamics ,  @xcite we can view the 2d coulomb gas model with langevin dynamics as the dynamic model for the `` pure '' 2d vortex response which includes neither any coupling to a spin - wave part nor any pinning . for a superconducting film in the absence of an external perpendicular magnetic field ( which corresponds to the absence of a net rotation in case of superfluid @xmath0he film ) , the numbers of vortices and antivortices ( with vorticities 1 and @xmath5 , respectively ) are always equal , and the system is described by the charge neutral two components 2d coulomb gas model ,  @xcite on which the ahns , as well as the mp , are based .",
    "although it was clearly shown from simulation of this neutral 2d coulomb gas model that the low - temperature phase is well described by the mp response form with the logarithmic divergence of the conductivity ,  @xcite there still remains the possibility that the coupling to the spin - wave part or pinning could also influence and perhaps lead to the anomalous response in certain cases .    in ref .",
    "it has been found in experiments that the 2d triangular josephson array in a perpendicular magnetic field is also well described by the mp response form , which has again been confirmed in simulations of the related frustrated 2d @xmath6 model with relaxation dynamics .",
    "@xcite since in these cases pinning could with large probability be excluded as the cause of the effect , the observed anomalous behavior can in these cases be attributed to either the logarithmic vortex interaction , or to the interplay between the vortex and the spin - wave interactions , or to a combination of both .",
    "@xcite from the analysis of the experimental results in ref .   for thin moge superconducting film in a perpendicular magnetic field ,",
    "it has also been pointed out that the data show mp behavior .",
    "@xcite since in ref .",
    "it was argued that for this sample the vortex pinning due to disorder was important , this raises the question of how pinning influences the dynamic behavior .",
    "could the mp response form also arise from an interplay between the vortex system and pinning ?",
    "in the present work we conclude , from simulations of the lattice coulomb gas model , that the vortex system , in the absence of couplings to the spin - wave part but in the presence of pinning , indeed in certain parameter regions gives rise to mp features reflecting an anomalous diffusion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : lcg ] we describe the coulomb gas model and the correlation functions we study in simulations .",
    "section  [ sec : dynamic ] gives a brief description of the features of the mp response form and make comparisons with the standard drude response form .",
    "the results from the simulations are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we try to give some perspective from comparisons with other results .",
    "in this work , we use the 2d coulomb gas model on an @xmath7 triangular lattice , whose hamiltonian in the absence of disorder is written as  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the integer charge on the @xmath10th site and the frustration @xmath11 controls the total number of charges @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the interaction @xmath14 between charges at positions @xmath15 and @xmath16 for a triangular lattice is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 with two primitive translational vectors @xmath21 and @xmath22 for 2d triangular lattice .",
    "( we choose @xmath23 and @xmath24 with lattice spacing set to unity . )",
    "we also study the effects of quenched disorder and consider the hamiltonian @xmath25 where the pinning potential @xmath26 at @xmath10 has value @xmath27 if the disorder is located at @xmath10 and @xmath28 otherwise .",
    "the randomly distributed disorder realization is parameterized by the pinning strength @xmath29 and the ratio @xmath30 between the number of pinning sites @xmath31 and the total number of charges @xmath32 : @xmath33 .",
    "this corresponds to point disorder since we can express it as @xmath34 in continuum limit , where @xmath16 denotes the positions of disordered sites .",
    "we use monte carlo ( mc ) dynamics which can be implemented as follows : allow two different mc tries where one is the charge hopping to one of its nearest neighbors , i.e. , @xmath35 , and the other is the generation of a charge - anticharge dipole on one bond , i.e. , @xmath36 . as was already observed in ref .",
    ", for parameters used in this work the acceptance ratio for generation of charge dipole is found to be extremely small even at temperatures much higher than the critical temperatures ( referring to the depinning and melting of the solid phase ) .",
    "we are here studying a temperature region where no charge dipoles are in practice created .",
    "consequently , we only include the charge hopping in our mc try .",
    "this means that the model we are studying only contain charges of one sign .",
    "our algorithm is thus : at each step , we first pick up one charge at random and try to move it to one of its six nearest neighboring sites which is also randomly chosen .",
    "this mc try is accepted or not according to the standard metropolis algorithm .",
    "one can make the mc simulation more efficient by using a nonlocal update ( e.g. , the randomly chosen charge can be allowed to hop to a distant site ) . on the other hand , as far as the dynamic behavior is concerned , the local update rule like the one used in the present work is believed to better imitate the relaxational dynamics of the corresponding continuum model ( which corresponds to the coulomb gas model with langevin dynamics ) .",
    "@xcite    for the characterizations of the thermodynamic properties , we measure ( i ) the dielectric constant @xmath37 , which corresponds to the helicity modulus in the vortex systems and detects the superconducting to normal transition , ( ii ) the orientational order parameter @xmath38 , which probes the melting of the solid - like structure , and ( iii ) the specific heat @xmath39 ( see ref .  ):",

    "we measure time @xmath56 in units of the mc step so that one time unit corresponds to @xmath32 mc tries to move the randomly chosen particle to one of its nearest neighbors .",

    "@xcite from this one directly infers that to leading order in small @xmath3 ( ref .  )",
    "@xmath59 where @xmath60 is a constant and the first equality in eq .",
    "( [ eq_ieps ] ) follows because @xmath37 is always a real quantity .",

    "@xcite this logarithmic divergence is another characteristics of the anomalous vortex diffusion .",
    "the mp form is given by @xmath64 and the corresponding explicit form of @xmath55 , which we denote by @xmath65 , hence incorporates the features associated with @xmath58 .",
    "@xcite the mp form is associated with a single characteristic frequency @xmath66 . in the 2d neutral coulomb gas",
    "all vortices are bound in vortex - antivortex pairs in the low - temperature phase .",
    "@xcite this implies an infinite correlation length which for a superconductor means a vanishing resistance @xmath67 .",
    "@xcite since the logarithmic divergence of the conductivity means that @xmath68 , a possible scenario is that the mp response form describes the response of the vortex - antivortex bound pairs and hence should apply to the low - temperature phase .",
    "it has been verified , from simulations of the 2d neutral coulomb gas with langevin dynamics , that the mp form indeed gives a very good description in this case .",
    "@xcite above the kt transition there are both free vortices and bound vortex - antivortex pairs present and hence there is a finite correlation length .",
    "this means that @xmath55 has an exponential decay of the form @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is a relaxation time and @xmath71 .",
    "thus a finite resistance is associated with an exponential decay of @xmath55 .",
    "if there were only free vortices then @xmath55 would be dominated by the exponential factor and the response should to good approximation be described by the standard drude form @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath73 more generally , when free vortices are present the response form @xmath74 has from simulations been shown to give a good parameterization of the data .",
    "@xcite    one difference between the mp response and the drude response , which is easy to gauge in experiments and simulations , is the peak ratio : the peak ratio ( pr ) is defined as the ratio between the real and imaginary part of the complex dielectric function at the frequency where @xmath75|$ ] has its maximum , i.e. , at the dissipation peak ( see fig .",
    "6 ) . for the standard drude response",
    "this ratio is 1 whereas it is @xmath76 for the mp response . in general",
    "when the resistance is finite the peak ratio should be between these two values , @xmath77 .",
    "our strategy is to calculate @xmath55 as described above and then to gauge the response by studying the peak ratio , @xmath55 for large @xmath56 , and to what extent the response is parameterized by the mp form .",
    "in this section , we first present the results of the mc simulations of the lattice coulomb gas model given by the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) for the case without random pinning sites , i.e. , @xmath78 in eq .  ( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "it is known that the system can undergo two phase transitions in this case :  @xcite one is the depinning of the solid at @xmath1 , corresponding to the superconducting to normal transition , and the other is the solid to liquid transition at @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "these two transitions can be identified by aid of the quantities @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "since the continuum system corresponds to an infinitesimally small lattice spacing and the frustration @xmath11 is proportional to the area of the elementary plaquette , the continuum limit of the lattice coulomb gas is given by @xmath81 , but with the number of particles @xmath32 still finite : @xmath82=const .",
    "the observation in ref .   that @xmath1 becomes smaller as @xmath11",
    "is decreased indicates that @xmath83 in the continuum system so that the system only has one transition at a nonzero temperature @xmath79 .",
    "we start by presenting some static results for @xmath84 on a @xmath85 triangular grid . in the simulations ,",
    "we start from high enough temperatures and anneal the system by decreasing the temperature slowly , to avoid being captured by metastable states at low temperatures .",
    "however , the local mc scheme used in this work ( a particle is only allowed to hop to its nearest neighbor sites ) makes it difficult to achieve equilibration near and below the transition .",
    "thus very many mc updates are required in this region ( our longest runs consists of @xmath86 mc steps ) . as @xmath87",
    "is decreased @xmath37 abruptly changes to unity near @xmath88 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : static16 ] ) .",
    "this abrupt change is associated with the normal ( high @xmath87 ) to superconducting ( low @xmath87 ) transition in the vortex system since @xmath37 corresponds to the superfluid density .",
    "@xcite in the coulomb gas model it corresponds to a transition where the coulomb gas systems becomes pinned to the underlying grid .",
    "the six - fold orientational order parameter @xmath38 has the value unity for a perfect triangular abrikosov vortex lattice .",
    "consequently the abrupt drop of @xmath38 seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : static16 ] indicates that the vortex solid melts into a vortex liquid near @xmath88 .",
    "the specific heat @xmath39 also shows a sharp maximum near this temperature @xmath88 .",
    "consequently the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : static16 ] for the lattice coulomb gas model with @xmath84 are consistent with a single phase transition corresponding to a transition where the superconductor becomes normal and the abrikosov vortex structure melts , i.e. , @xmath89 .",
    "@xcite    we next turn to the dynamic results for @xmath84 .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamic16 ] : the characteristic frequency @xmath66 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamic16](a ) , determined from the peak position of @xmath75|$ ] , shows a dip - like feature near @xmath90 , reflecting a critical slowing down close to the phase transition ( compare the static results in fig .",
    "[ fig : static16 ] ) .",
    "in general , a system composed of particles is expected to be well described by a drude approximation at sufficiently high temperatures because the interaction between the particles becomes negligible in comparison with the strong thermal fluctuations .",
    "the dynamic response function in such a temperature regime should be well described by the drude response form eqs .",
    "( [ eq_reps ] ) and ( [ eq_ieps ] ) and should consequently be well characterized by the peak ratio ( pr ) equal to one . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : static16](b ) , the dynamic dielectric function indeed approaches the drude pr value one at higher temperatures .",
    "however , the pr crosses over to a value close to pr=0.64 which characterizes the anomalous behavior ( see the previous section ) as we approach @xmath88 from above .",
    "@xcite    the question is then what causes this crossover behavior .",
    "is it associated with the depinning transition at @xmath1 or with the melting transition at @xmath79 ? in order to address this question one needs a temperature separation between the two transitions . in ref .",
    ", it was shown that as @xmath11 is decreased , the two transitions present become well separated . with this in mind we , as a next step , repeat the simulations for a much smaller value of @xmath11 .",
    "figure  [ fig : static64 ] shows the static results @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 for the system with @xmath91 on a @xmath92 lattice . as seen from the figure ,",
    "the superconducting to normal transition is now at @xmath93 and is well separated from the vortex solid melting transition at @xmath94 , as was found in ref .  .",
    "as also seen in fig  [ fig : static64 ] , the existence of two transitions are also reflected by two peaks in @xmath39 : one near @xmath1 and another broader one near @xmath79 .",
    "the intermediate phase existing between @xmath1 and @xmath79 is characterized by a vanishing @xmath37 together with a nonzero @xmath38 and is interpreted as a floating solid phase :  @xcite the vortex solid structure is depinned from the underlying discrete grid and floats around , which leads to dissipation of energy .",
    "next we analyze the dynamic response function for @xmath91 is terms of the characteristic frequency @xmath66 and the peak ratio pr . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamic64 ] , it is shown that @xmath66 displays a dip - like structure , reflecting a critical slowing down near @xmath1 rather than at @xmath79 .",
    "@xcite similarly , the correspondence of the crossover behavior for @xmath84 in pr from drude to anomalous response form shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamic16](b ) , is in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamic64](b ) found to be near @xmath1 and not near @xmath79 .",
    "@xcite from this we conclude that the crossover behavior in the dynamic response is associated with @xmath1 and hence with the pinning of the coulomb gas to the underlying lattice .",
    "thus for the pure one component lattice coulomb gas with mc dynamics we infer that there is a crossover behavior from a normal drude like response to an anomalous response .",
    "an essential ingredient for the appearance of the anomalous response is associated with the pinning between the vortex system and the underlying lattice .      in the previous section we inferred that the pinning , caused by the underlying lattice , leads to a crossover from a drude to an anomalous dynamic response . in the present section we study the role of pinning further by introducing extrinsic vortex pinning caused by disorder into the model .",
    "the general idea is that the anomaly in the dynamics is caused by a sluggish motion of the vortex system and that pinning hindering the vortex motion can cause such a behavior . to this end",
    "we introduce point impurities into the lattice coulomb gas model as described by the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) . for a superconductor",
    "this corresponds to magnetic point impurities . in this section",
    ", we perform mc dynamic simulations for 10 different disorder realizations in order to get disorder averaged quantities .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : prpin ] the pr for the system with @xmath91 and @xmath95 at @xmath96 is displayed as a function of the pinning strength @xmath29 ( the number of pinning sites @xmath31 is fixed to 14 , which approximately corresponds to 10% of the total number of vortices @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath97 ) . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : prpin ] the dynamic response for the pure case ( @xmath98 ) has pr close to one at this higher @xmath87 [ compare fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamic64](b ) ] .",
    "this means that the pinning to the underlying lattice at this @xmath87 is too weak to influence the behavior so that the vortices should obey a drude response .",

    "[ fig : prpin ] shows a decreasing pr with increasing pinning strength again suggesting a crossover towards an anomalous dynamic response [ compare fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamic64](b ) ] .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that when the pinning strength becomes stronger , the motion of the vortices becomes more sluggish , resulting in a decrease of the pr and a crossover to an anomalous response .",
    "this scenario implies that if we introduce enough pinning then the crossover to the anomalous response should become complete . to achieve this we investigate a stronger pinning case where @xmath99 and the pinning strength @xmath100 .",

    "figure  [ fig : ewall](a ) shows that a reasonable fit of @xmath52 to the mp form is obtained in the anomalous case @xmath101 .",

    "we have thus shown that for the one component lattice coulomb gas , at a @xmath87 so high that the pinning to the underlying lattice plays no role , it is still possible to obtain a crossover to the anomalous response by introducing pinning through randomly distributed pinning sites .",
    "we have found from simulations that the 2d one component lattice coulomb gas with monte carlo dynamics under certain circumstances displays an anomalous dynamic response . an essential ingredient for the appearance of this anomalous response",
    "is found to be pinning ; either pinning due to the underlying lattice or external pinning induced by disorder .",
    "the anomalous response vanishes gradually as the pinning effects become weaker and from this we conclude that there is no anomaly in the absence of pinning .",
    "we gauge the degree of anomaly in the response by the behavior of the correlation function @xmath55 for large @xmath56 , the peak ratio , and to what extent the response can be parameterized by the mp form .",
    "we find that the full anomaly is characterized by @xmath58 for large @xmath56 , a peak ratio consistent with @xmath107 and note that these two features are also incorporated into the phenomenological mp form .",
    "for the one component lattice coulomb gas this means that an anomalous response in the absence of externally introduced pinning only appears very close to the depinning of the vortex system from the underlying lattice structure . from this",
    "we further infer that the pure continuum one component coulomb gas has no anomalous response and that in this case external pinning is required to change the response from normal to anomalous .",
    "it is interesting to compare this with the 2d neutral ( two components ) continuum coulomb gas with langevin dynamics which is the generic model for the vortex physics of a 2d superconductor(superfluid ) in the absence of an external perpendicular magnetic field ( net rotation ) .",
    "@xcite this model undergoes a kt transition and below this transition the dynamic response has from simulations been shown to be anomalous characterized by @xmath58 for large @xmath56 , a peak ratio consistent with @xmath107 , and to be well described by the mp form .",
    "@xcite since the same response form is found for the one component coulomb gas in the presence of external pinning , as for the 2d neutral ( two component ) coulomb gas below the kt transition , one might speculate about a common physical feature .",
    "we here suggest that the common physical feature is pinning ; in the one case externally introduced and in the other intrinsic in the sense that negative vortices act as ( moving ) pinning centers for positive ones ( and vice versa ) . in both cases",
    "the pinning mechanism suppresses the free vortex diffusion .",
    "when this suppression is complete the response becomes anomalous as for the one component coulomb gas with enough external pinning and for the neutral coulomb gas below the kt - transition where all positive and negative vortices are bound together in pairs .",
    "thus our conclusion based on simulations is that the 2d one component _ continuum _",
    "coulomb gas can not have an anomalous response by itself .",
    "this is in contrast to the theoretical considerations in ref .",
    ", based on a mori approximation scheme , which suggest that the one component model in certain parameter regions could have an anomalous response .",
    "we have not been able to find any support for this suggestion in our simulations .",
    "the mp form  @xcite was originally motivated for the 2d neutral ( two components ) coulomb gas as an extension of the ahns phenomenology  @xcite and was assumed to describe the response of bound vortex pairs .",
    "other recent improvements of the ahns phenomenology also gives a peak ratio close to @xmath107 .",
    "@xcite however , the mp form is to our knowledge the only form that incorporates both the large @xmath56 behavior @xmath58 and the peak ratio @xmath107 , both of which seems to be characteristics of the anomalous response . in the one component coulomb gas case with external pinning",
    "there is at present really no motivation for the mp form ; it is just a simple form which simultaneously incorporates two features which seem to be characteristics of the anomalous response .",
    "@xcite    our basic conclusion is that the anomalous response form can indeed arise from an interplay between pinning and a vortex system associated with an external perpendicular magnetic field . in this context",
