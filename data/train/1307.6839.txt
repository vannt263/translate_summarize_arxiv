    "according to quantum theory , space - like separated experiments performed on entangled particles can produce outcomes whose correlations violate bell inequalities @xcite that would be satisfied if the experiments could be described by local hidden variable theories ( lhvts ) .",
    "many experiments have tested the quantum prediction of nonlocal causality ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the observed violations of bell inequalities are consistent with quantum theory .",
    "they refute lhvts with overwhelmingly high degrees of confidence , modulo some known loopholes that arise from the difficulty in carrying out theoretically ideal experiments  most notably the locality loophole ( closed in @xcite ) , the detection efficiency loophole ( @xcite , closed in @xcite ) and the collapse locality loophole ( @xcite , addressed in @xcite , though not fully closed ) .",
    "typically , bell experiments test the chsh inequality @xcite in an epr - bohm experiment @xcite in which two entangled particles are sent to different experimental setups at different locations .",
    "one setup is controlled by alice , who performs one of two possible measurements @xmath3 ; the other by bob , who similarly performs @xmath4 .",
    "alice s and bob s outcomes @xmath5 and",
    "@xmath6 are assigned numerical values @xmath7 , corresponding to ` spin up ' or ` spin down ' for spin measurements about given axes on spin-@xmath8 particles .",
    "the experiments must be completed at space - like separated regions .",
    "the experiment is repeated many times , ideally under identical experimental conditions .",
    "we define the correlation @xmath9 as the average value of the product of alice s and bob s outcomes in experiments where measurements @xmath10 and @xmath11 are chosen .    according to deterministic lhvts",
    ", the outcomes @xmath5 , @xmath6 are determined respectively by the measurement choices @xmath10 , @xmath11 and by hidden variables @xmath12 shared by both particles .",
    "thus , @xmath13 .",
    "an lhvt also assigns a probability distribution @xmath14 , independent of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , to the hidden variables , satisfying @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the sample space of hidden variables .",
    "probabilistic lhvts can be described by the same equations , extending the definitions of @xmath12 and @xmath18 to allow for probabilistic measurement outcomes ; we can thus focus on deterministic lhvts without loss of generality .",
    "an lhvt predicts @xmath19 .",
    "such correlations satisfy the chsh inequality @xcite : @xmath20    consider for definiteness the epr - bohm experiment performed on spin-@xmath8 particles in the singlet state @xmath21 .",
    "alice and bob measure their particle spin projection along the directions @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "as before , alice and bob choose a measurement from a set of two elements , that is , @xmath24 .",
    "in general , the vectors @xmath22 and @xmath23 can point along any direction in three - dimensional euclidean space , and the sets of their possible values define bloch spheres @xmath25 . the correlation predicted by quantum theory",
    "is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "sets of measurement axes can be found for which the quantum correlations violate the chsh inequality , @xmath28 , up to the cirelson @xcite bound @xmath29 .    when alice s and bob s measurement choices belong to a set of @xmath30 possible elements , the correlations predicted by lhvts satisfy the braunstein - caves inequality @xcite : @xmath31    the chsh inequality is a special case of the braunstein - caves inequality with @xmath32 .",
    "we are interested here in exploring bell inequalities that generalize the chsh and braunstein - caves inequalities , in the following sense . instead of restricting alice s and bob s measurement choices to a finite set , we allow them to choose any spin measurement axes , @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    ". however , we constrain these axes to be separated by a fixed angle @xmath0 , so @xmath35 . the maximal violation of the braunstein - caves inequality by quantum correlations , given by @xmath36 @xcite , arises for fixed sets of pairs of axis choices that satisfy this constraint with @xmath37 .",
    "we consider experiments where pairs of axes separated by @xmath0 are chosen randomly and where @xmath0 is unrestricted .",
    "our work contributes to understanding how to quantify quantum nonlocality , by studying a natural class of bell inequalities that has not previously been considered .",
    "as well as proving new inequalities , our work raises new questions and suggests new techniques that we hope will be developed further .",
    "another more practical motivation is to explore simple bell tests that might allow quantum theory and lhvt to be distinguished somewhat more efficiently , particularly in the adversarial context of quantum cryptography . here",
    "an eavesdropper and/or malicious device manufacturer may be trying to spoof the correlations of a singlet using locally held or generated information .",
    "of course , given sufficient guarantees about the devices involved , modulo the loopholes mentioned above , and with sufficiently many runs , any bell test can expose such spoofing .",
    "however , in practical situations in which the number of possible tests is limited , users would like to ensure that such eavesdropping attacks can be detected as efficiently as possible .",
    "standard chsh tests simplify the eavesdropper s problem , by informing her in advance that she need only generate outcomes for a small set of possible measurements . by comparison , tests involving randomly chosen axes give the eavesdropper no such information . and a list of random pairs of axes separated by @xmath0 .",
    "another would be to make random independent choices and then generate plots of the correlations as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "this second type of test would be generated automatically by quantum key distribution schemes that require alice and bob to make completely random measurements on each qubit ( e.g. @xcite ) . ]",
    "a first step towards understanding alice s and bob s optimal test strategy in such contexts is to identify the full range of bell inequalities available .",
    "we explore lhvts in which alice s and bob s spin measurement results are given by @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively ; where @xmath12 is a local hidden variable common to both particles . for fixed @xmath12",
    ", we can describe the functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 by two binary ( black and white ) colourings of spheres , associated with @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , where black ( white ) represents the outcome ` 1 '  ( ` -1 ' ) .",
    "different sphere colourings are associated with different values of @xmath12 .",
    "to look at specific cases , we drop the @xmath12-dependence and include a label @xmath40 that indicates a particular pair of colouring functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "measuring spin along @xmath33 with outcome @xmath43 is equivalent to measuring spin along @xmath44 with outcome @xmath45 .",
    "the colouring functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 defining any lhvt are thus necessarily _ antipodal _ functions : @xmath46 for all @xmath47 .",
    "we notice that the antipodal property arises due to the definition of a dichotomic measurement on the sphere for arbitrary deterministic lhvts . for an arbitrary probabilistic theory , this property would read @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath47 and the label @xmath40 indicates a particular probabilistic theory being considered .",
    "equation ( [ eq : antipodalprob ] ) holds because a measurement is defined by a pair of opposite axes , @xmath33 and @xmath44 , and inverting their sense corresponds only to relabelling the measurement outcomes .",
    "we define @xmath50 as the set of all colourings @xmath40 satisfying the antipodal property , eq .",
    "( [ eq : antipodalx ] ) .",
    "for example , a simple colouring of the spheres satisfying the antipodal property is _ colouring 1 _ , in which , for one sphere , one hemisphere is completely black and the other one is completely white , and the colouring is reversed for the other sphere ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the correlation for outcomes of measurements about randomly chosen axes separated by @xmath0 for the pair of colouring functions labelled by @xmath40 is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the area element of the sphere corresponding to alice s axis @xmath33 and @xmath53 is an angle in the range @xmath54 $ ] along the circle described by bob s axis @xmath34 with an angle @xmath0 with respect to @xmath33 .",
    "a general correlation is of the form @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a probability distribution over @xmath50 .",
    "if all colourings @xmath57 satisfy @xmath58 or @xmath59 for quantum correlations @xmath60 and @xmath61 obtained with particular two - qubit states @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and some identifiable lower and upper bounds , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively , then a general correlation @xmath66 must satisfy the same inequalities .",
    "our aim here is to explore this possibility via intuitive arguments and numerical and analytic results .",
    "we focus on the case @xmath67 , for which @xmath68 , which is the maximum quantum anticorrelation for a given angle @xmath0 ( see sec . [",
    "sec : rqe ] for details and related questions ) .",
    "we begin with some suggestive observations .",
    "first , we consider colouring functions @xmath57 for which the probability that alice and bob obtain opposite outcomes when they choose the same measurement , averaged uniformly over all measurement choices , is @xmath69 in general , @xmath70 .",
    "we first consider small values of @xmath71 and seek bell inequalities distinguishing quantum correlations for the singlet from classical correlations for which an anticorrelation is observed with probability @xmath72 when the same measurement axis is chosen on both sides .",
    "experimentally , we can verify quantum nonlocality using these results if we carry out nonlocality tests that include some frequency of anticorrelation tests about a randomly chosen axis ( chosen independently for each test ) .",
    "the anticorrelation tests allow statistical bounds on @xmath71 , which imply statistical tests of nonlocality via the @xmath71-dependent bell inequalities .",
    "in the limiting case @xmath73 , we have @xmath74 for all @xmath75 .",
    "this case is quite interesting theoretically , in that one might hope to prove stronger results assuming perfect anticorrelation .",
    "we describe some numerical explorations of this case below .",
    "second , for any pair of colourings @xmath57 and @xmath76 $ ] , we have @xmath77 .",
    "this can be seen as follows . for a fixed @xmath33 , the circle with angle @xmath78 around the axis @xmath33 , defined by the angle @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) contains a point @xmath34 that is antipodal to a point on the circle with angle @xmath79 around @xmath33 . since the colouring is antipodal , we have that the value of the integral @xmath80 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) for @xmath78 is the negative of the corresponding integral for @xmath79 .",
    "it follows that @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , in the rest of this paper , we restrict to consider correlations for the range @xmath82 $ ] , unless otherwise stated . from the previous argument",
    ", we have @xmath83 , which implies that @xmath84",
    ". we also have that @xmath85 , so the lhvts we consider give @xmath86 .",
    "the lhv correlations given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) and ( [ eq:17.1 ] ) in the case @xmath73 thus coincide with the singlet - state quantum correlations for @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "third , consider colouring 1 , defined above .",
    "we have @xmath91 , for @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "this is easily seen as follows .",
    "for any two different points on the spheres defining colouring 1 , @xmath33 in one sphere and @xmath34 in the oppositely coloured one , an arc of angle @xmath92 of the great circle passing through @xmath33 and @xmath34 is completely black and the other arc of angle @xmath92 is completely white .",
    "thus , given that the pair of vectors @xmath33 and @xmath34 are chosen randomly , subject to the constraint of angle separation @xmath0 , the probability that both @xmath33 and @xmath34 are in oppositely coloured regions is @xmath93 .",
    "thus , the correlation for colouring 1 is @xmath94 .",
    "that is , @xmath95 linearly interpolates between the values at @xmath96 , which is common to all colourings with @xmath73 , and @xmath97 , which is common to all colourings , and we have @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "then , in the following section we present some lemmas and a theorem .",
    "in this section , we motivate two _ hemispherical colouring maximality hypotheses_. these make precise the intuition that , for a continuous range of @xmath100 , the maximum lhv anticorrelation is obtained by colouring @xmath101 .",
    "we first consider the following lemmas , whose proofs are given in appendix [ appendix proofs ] .",
    "[ lemma1 ] for any colouring @xmath57 satisfying eq .",
    "( [ eq:17.1 ] ) and any @xmath102 $ ] , we have @xmath103 .",
    "[ remark1 ] unsurprisingly , since small @xmath71 implies near - perfect anticorrelation at @xmath87 , we see that for @xmath102 $ ] and @xmath71 small there are no colourings with very strong correlations",
    ". however , strong anticorrelations are possible for small @xmath0 .",
    "we are interested in bounding these .",
    "[ lemma1]lemma    [ lemma2 ] for any colouring @xmath57 satisfying eq .",
    "( [ eq:17.1 ] ) , any integer @xmath104 and any @xmath105 , we have @xmath106 .    [ remark1]remark    [ remark2 ] in other words , for small @xmath0 , @xmath107 is very close to the maximal possible anticorrelation for lhvts when @xmath108 .",
    "geometric intuitions also suggest bounds on @xmath109 that are maximised by colouring @xmath101 for small @xmath0 .",
    "consider _ simple colourings _ , in which a set of ( not necessarily connected ) piecewise differentiable curves of finite total length separate black and white regions .",
    "( points lying on these curves may have either colour . )",
    "intuition suggests that , for small @xmath0 and simple colourings with @xmath73 , the quantity @xmath110 , which measures the deviation from pure anticorrelation , should be bounded by a quantity roughly proportional to the length of the boundary between the black and white areas of the sphere colouring @xmath57 .",
    "since colouring @xmath101 has the smallest such boundary ( the equator ) , this might suggest that @xmath111 for small @xmath0 and for all simple colourings @xmath57 with @xmath73 .",
    "intuition also suggests that any non - simple colouring will produce less anticorrelation than the optimal simple colouring , because regions in which black and white colours alternate with arbitrarily small separation tend to wash out anticorrelation .",
    "these intuitive arguments are clearly not rigorous as currently formulated . for example",
    ", they ignore the possibility of sequences of colourings @xmath112 and angles @xmath113 such that @xmath114 , while @xmath115 for all @xmath116 ( see @xcite for an extended discussion ) .",
    "still , they are suggestive , at least in generating hypotheses to be investigated .",
    "these various observations motivate us to explore what we call the weak hemispherical colouring maximality hypothesis ( whcmh ) .",
    "there exists an angle @xmath117 such that for every colouring @xmath57 with @xmath73 and every angle @xmath118 $ ] , @xmath119 .",
    "the whcmh considers models with perfect anticorrelation for @xmath87 , because we are interested in distinguishing lhv models from the quantum singlet state , which produces perfect anticorrelations for @xmath87 .",
    "of course , there is a symmetry in the space of lhv models given by exchanging the colours of one qubit s sphere , which maps @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the whcmh thus also implies that @xmath122 for all colourings @xmath57 with @xmath123 .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate stronger versions of the whcmh and related questions .",
    "for instance , is it the case that for every angle @xmath124 there exists a colouring @xmath125 with @xmath73 such that @xmath126 ?",
    "further , does this hypothesis still hold true ( not necessarily for the same @xmath127 ) if we consider general local hidden variable models corresponding to independently chosen colourings for the two qubits , not constrained by any choice of the correlation parameter @xmath71 ?",
    "the following theorem and lemmas , whose proofs are presented in appendix [ appendix proofs ] , give some relevant bounds .",
    "[ theorem1 ] for any colouring @xmath57 , any integer @xmath128 and any @xmath129 , we have @xmath130 .",

    "there exists an angle @xmath147 such that for every colouring @xmath57 and every angle @xmath148 $ ] , @xmath149 .",
    "note that the shcmh applies to all colourings , without any assumption of perfect anticorrelation for @xmath87 .",
    "if the shcmh is true then so is the whcmh . in this case",

    "for example , alice and bob could have an arbitrary entangled state on which they perform arbitrary local quantum operations and measurements . in a different scenario , alice and bob",

    "another relevant observation is that the antipodal property ( [ eq : antipodalprob ] ) , expressed in the equivalent form @xmath164 , together with a continuity assumption , implies that quantum nonlocal correlations are not dominated @xcite : if a correlation @xmath66 produces a violation of the chsh inequality stronger than the violation given by the singlet - state quantum correlation @xmath146 for a given set of measurement axes then there exists another set of measurement axes for which @xmath66 gives a violation ( or none ) that is weaker than the violation given by @xmath146 .",
    "it would be interesting to clarify further the relationship between measures of nonlocality , including those investigated here , and no - signalling .",
    "as mentioned in the main text , some interesting related questions involving non - local games with continuous inputs have been considered in @xcite . in particular , in the third game considered in @xcite , alice and bob are given uniformly distributed bloch sphere vectors , @xmath260 and @xmath261 , and aim to maximise the probability of producing outputs that are anticorrelated if @xmath262 or correlated if @xmath263 .",

    "our earlier results also prove that there is a quantum advantage for all @xmath0 in the range @xmath264 , and hence for many versions of this game defined by a variety of probability distributions for the inputs .",
    "we show eq .",
    "( [ eq : new ] ) below .",
    "first , we compute the average outcome probabilities when alice and bob apply local projective measurements on a two - qubit state @xmath18 , for measurement bases defined by bloch vectors separated by an angle @xmath0 .",
    "the average is taken over random rotations of these vectors in the bloch sphere , subject to the angle separation @xmath0 .",
    "then , we compute the quantum correlations .    consider a fixed pair of pure qubit states @xmath265 and @xmath266 for alice s and bob s measurements , respectively , corresponding to outcomes ` + 1 ' .",
    "a general state for bob s measurement separated by an angle @xmath0 with respect to a fixed state @xmath265 for alice s measurement is obtained by applying the unitary @xmath267 that corresponds to a rotation of an angle @xmath268 $ ] around the @xmath269 axis in the bloch sphere , which only adds a phase to the state @xmath265 .",
    "then , after applying @xmath267 , a general pure product state @xmath270 of two qubits with bloch vectors separated by an angle @xmath0 is obtained by applying the unitary @xmath271 that rotates the bloch sphere around the @xmath176 axis by an angle @xmath272 $ ] and then around the @xmath269 axis by an angle @xmath273 $ ] .",

    "the probability that both alice and bob obtain the outcome ` + 1 ' is @xmath279 where in the third line we used the linearity and the cyclicity of the trace and in the fourth line we used the definition @xmath280 .",
    "the state @xmath281 is invariant under a unitary transformation @xmath282 , for any @xmath283 .",

    "( [ eq : quantumcorrelation ] ) we see that after integrating over the haar measure on su(2 ) , we obtain @xmath288 .",
    "we have explored here what can be learned by carrying out local projective measurements about completely randomly chosen axes , separated by an angle @xmath0 , on a pair of qubits .",
    "this is not currently a standard way of testing for entanglement or nonlocality , but we have shown that it distinguishes quantum correlations from those predicted by local hidden variables for a wide range of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we find bell inequalities for @xmath99 , given by theorem [ theorem1 ] , which separate the singlet - state quantum correlations from all lhv correlations for @xmath165",
    ".    we have also explored hypotheses that would refine and unify these results further : the weak and strong hemispherical colouring maximality hypotheses .",
    "these state that the lhv defined by the simplest spherical colouring , with opposite hemispheres coloured oppositely , maximizes the lhv anticorrelations for a continuous range of @xmath166 , either among lhvs with perfect anticorrelation at @xmath87 ( the weak case ) or without any restriction ( the strong case ) .",
    "we should note here that the intuition supporting the whcmh relates specifically to colourings in two or more dimensions , where there seems no obvious way of constructing colourings that vary over small scales in a way that is regular enough to produce very strong ( anti ) correlations for small @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , the one - dimensional analog of the whcmh  that the strongest anticorrelations for colourings on the circle arise from colouring opposite half - circles oppositely  is easily seen to be false .",
    "for @xmath167 odd , the colouring @xmath168 with @xmath169 $ ] is antipodal and is perfectly anticorrelated for @xmath170 .",
    "although it underlines that the hemispherical colouring hypotheses are non - trivial , this distinction between one and higher dimensions is consistent with what is known about other colouring problems in geometric combinatorics @xcite . the intuition that colouring @xmath101 should be optimal , because it solves the isoperimetric problem of finding the coloured region with half the area of the sphere that has the shortest boundary , remains suggestive .",
    "verifying the whcmh and the shcmh look at first sight like simple classical problems in geometry and combinatorics that can be stated quite independently of quantum theory .",
    "they have many interesting generalisations .",
    ", which colouring(s ) produce maximal correlation ? or , consider a general region @xmath171 of volume @xmath172 in @xmath173 , and define @xmath174 to be the probability that , given a randomly chosen point @xmath175 , and a randomly chosen point @xmath176 such that @xmath177 , we find that @xmath178 .",
    "do the balls maximize this probability , for any given sufficiently small @xmath179 ?",
    "] nonetheless , as far as we are aware , these questions have not been seriously studied by pure mathematicians to date , although some intriguing relatively recent results @xcite on colourings in @xmath173 encourage hope that proof methods could indeed be found .",
    "we thus simply state the whcmh and the shcmh as interesting and seemingly plausible hypotheses to be investigated further rather than offering them as conjectures , preferring to reserve the latter terms for propositions for which very compelling evidence has been amassed .",
    "we would like to stress what we see as a key insight deserving further exploration , namely that stronger and more general bell inequalities could in principle be proven by results about continuous colourings , rather than restricting to colourings of discrete sets .",
    "while we have focussed on the simplest case of projective measurements of pairs of qubits , this observation of course applies far more generally .",
    "we hope our work will stimulate further investigation of the whcmh and the shcmh and related colouring problems , which seem very interesting in their own right , and in developing further this intriguing link between pretty and natural questions in geometric combinatorics and measures of quantum nonlocality .",
    "we have considered here the ideal case in which alice and bob share a maximally entangled pure state and are able to carry out perfect projective measurements about axes specified with perfect precision . for a range of non - zero @xmath0 , our results show a finite separation between the predictions of quantum theory and lhvts . as is the case for chsh and other bell tests , they can thus also be applied ( within a certain parameter range ) to realistic experiments in which the entangled state is mixed and measurements can only be approximately specified .",
    "in particular , they offer new methods for exploring the range of parameters for which the correlations defined by rotationally symmetric werner states can be distinguished from those of any lhvt @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to explore this further .    finally , but importantly , we would like to note earlier work on related questions . in a pioneering paper ,",
    "ukowski @xcite considered generalised bell and ghz tests for maximally entangled quantum states that involve all possible axis choices , and gave an elegant proof that the quantum correlations can be distinguished from all possible lhvt correlations by a weighted average measure of correlation functions . for the bipartite case ,",
    "our work investigates the gap between quantum and lhvt correlations at each axis angle separation .",
    "this allows one to define infinitely many generalised bell tests corresponding to different weighted averages of correlation functions . it would be interesting to characterise the space of all such tests and its boundaries",
    "references @xcite investigate _ inter alia _ bell - chsh experiments in which the axes are initially chosen randomly , and the same axes are used repeatedly throughout a given experimental run .",
    "reference @xcite shows that such experiments lead to bell inequality violations a significant fraction of the time when pairs of random local measurements are chosen .",
    "references @xcite show that by considering triads of random local measurements , constrained to be mutually unbiased , for which alice s axes are not perfectly aligned to bob s axes , the violation of a chsh inequality is guaranteed on a two qubit maximally entangled state .",
    "their scenarios are significantly different from ours . in our scenario ,",
    "the axes are chosen randomly and independently for each measurement , and ( in the ideal case ) alice and bob have the ability to define their axis choices precisely with respect to the same reference frame .",
    "the goals are also different : references @xcite show that bell inequality violation can be demonstrated even when alice and bob do not have a shared reference frame ; our aim is to establish new bell inequalities rather than to exploit the power of known inequalities",
