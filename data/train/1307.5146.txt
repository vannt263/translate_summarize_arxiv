    "the evolution of protoplanetary disks is crucial for distinguishing between different models of planet formation , and the long wavelength emission from such disks is key to understanding this evolution .",
    "a number of theoretical models for planet formation within circumstellar disks have been proposed : the formation of gas giants by core accretion and atmospheric accumulation ( pollack et  al . 1996 ; hubickyj et  al .",
    "2005 ) , is known to suffer from time scale difficulties , although these can be alleviated by the extended models such as that of alibert et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) who build on the standard core accretion models to provide a more rapid method of planet formation ; alternatively the theory of planet formation by gravitational instability mechanisms ( boss et  al . 1992 ; 1997 ; rice et  al .",
    "2005 ) is proposed , although this method has been noted to require proto - planetary disk masses generally in excess of those currently measured from sub - mm data to proceed successfully .",
    "the second of these issues , that of missing mass , is exacerbated by an inexact understanding of the evolution of the dust emissivity , @xmath7 , in these objects .",
    "disk masses derived from sub - mm and centimetre flux densities are critically sensitive to the value of this parameter , with @xmath8 .",
    "an increase in the emissivity results in a decrease in the derived mass , and vice - versa .",
    "emissivity is a function of grain size and composition in the disk and , although it can be modeled theoretically , observationally determining its value and behaviour as a function of frequency is not trivial .",
    "the effect of such multiplicity is a further issue which has been suggested to influence planet formation .",
    "it has been found that approximately a quarter of known extra - solar planets are located in binary or poly - stellar systems ( e.g. mugrauer & neuhuser 2009 ) and this bias is generally considered to be due to the increased dynamical complexity of such systems which results in their inner regions being swept clear of material , allowing gas to flow through the gap and influence the mass gain of gas giant planets ( ayliffe & bate 2010 ) .    determining the dust characteristics of the protoplanetary disks around young stars , whether in multiple systems or otherwise , is a complicated process . at sub - millimetre wavelengths",
    "it is complicated by opacity effects , as well as contamination by envelope , rather than disk , dominated emission at shorter wavelengths . at microwave frequencies the emission from disks",
    "is thought to be largely optically thin , avoiding the former as well as the latter of these issues .",
    "however , the emission is significantly fainter than at sub - mm frequencies , and furthermore can be contaminated by additional radio emission from ionized gas in the vicinity of these objects ( e.g. owen , scaife & ercolano 2013 ) .",
    "radio frequency measurements of disks provide a useful tool as the emission is expected to be optically thin at such long wavelengths .",
    "in addition , in the rayleigh - jeans region ( @xmath9 ) the opacity of the thermal emission from dust grains can be well approximated by a power law , @xmath10 .",
    "this index @xmath11 can be related to the spectral index of flux density measurements , here defined as @xmath12 , as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the ratio of optically thick to optically thin emission ( beckwith et  al .",
    "1990 ) . in the sub - mm region , 350@xmath15 m to 1.3 mm , this has been determined to have an average value @xmath16 ( rodmann et  al . 2006 ; lommen et  al .",
    "2007 ) , however at much longer cm - wavelengths @xmath17 , as the emission is entirely optically thin and consequently the largest grain sizes can be determined directly from a measure of the radio spectral index .    in spite of these advantages ,",
    "there are also a number of disadvantages in observing disks at longer wavelengths .",
    "firstly , the emission is fainter due to the spectrum falling off steeply at lower frequencies .",
    "secondly , there is confusion at longer wavelengths from the additional radio emission often associated with protostellar systems .",
    "although higher resolution imaging offers significant advantages in this regard , separating residual radio emission from the dust emission still requires a careful disentangling of spectral components ( see e.g. melis et  al .",
    "it has been shown ( ami consortium : scaife et  al .",
    "2012 ) that considering radio and dust components separately can give substantially different values for both the spectral slope of each component , important for determining opacity indices , as well as the normalization of each component , important for determining disk mass .",
    "degeneracies between different parameters , increased in the case of lack of data or unfavourable spectral combinations may be a limiting factor in the accuracy with which such parameters can be determined .    in this paper",
    "we examine the long wavelength emission from the well - known ggtaua disk / ring system , extending the sed to centimeter wavelengths ; we briefly describe this system in ",

    "this is important when considering the implications of grain growth and the potential of the system to form planetesimals via the core accretion model .",
    "the canonical timescale for core accretion planet formation is 8myr ( pollack et  al .",
    "1996 ) , nominally precluding planet formation in both the ggtaua and twhya systems . however , hubickyi et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) calculated that a reduction in dust opacity could half this timescale and , subsequently , the migration and disk evolution model of alibert et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) demonstrated that in fact the formation timescale could be reduced to as little as @xmath127myr .",
    "furthermore , this reduction in timescale due to migration is not mutually exclusive with that due to dust opacity reduction and the combination of effects would shorten formation times even further .",
    "these revised versions of the core accretion mechanism of planet formation suggest that planet formation is feasible even in systems as young as ggtaua .",
    "indeed , planet formation has been suggested for even younger systems still , such as in the case of hltau , a class  i object ( @xmath128yr ; greaves et  al .",
    "although in the case of hltau the disk mass was found to be high enough to allow the gravitational instability model of planet formation to operate .",
    "once again the opacity index of the long wavelength emission from hltau was suggestive of centimeter - size grains and in this case a surface density enhancement ( 4.5@xmath19 ) was detected and proposed as a potential protoplanet .",
    "we have detected the ggtaua ring / disk system at a wavelength of @xmath0 cm . using these new data in combination with archival data compiled from the literature",
    "we have investigated the long wavelength sed of the system with a number of results .",
    "we propose that the detected flux is due to thermal dust emission from the ggtaua system and that additional radio emission mechanisms contribute negligibly to the integrated flux density , if at all .",
    "we suggest that , although the centimetre - wave emission is dominated by the dense ggtaua ring , the outer radius of the emission is larger than that of the ring alone and is therefore likely to encompass the complete ring / disk system .",
    "we find a dust mass for the ggtaua combined ring / disk system of @xmath129m@xmath4 .",
    "we find that the opacity index of the ggtaua long wavelength emission is broadly consistent with unity , but there are indications that the spectrum flattens further at wavelengths longer than 7 mm .",
    "we suggest that this flattening of the spectrum implies a dust population with maximum grain sizes in excess of 4 cm and that this indicates coagulation of dust grains within the ggtaua system into bodies more similar in size to small rocks than traditional dust .    with the indication of grain growth in the disk , and considering the relatively young age of the ggtau association ( @xmath130myr ) in combination with the low derived disk mass",
    ", we suggest that this may be a good system with which to test rapid planet formation models such as that of alibert et  al .",
