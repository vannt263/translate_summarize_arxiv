    "the radius where volatiles sublimate in a protoplanetary disk plays an important role in planet formation .",

    "spitzer_. the far - infrared spectrometers aboard the _ herschel _ space telescope will offer the opportunity to measure the pure rotational transitions of this important molecule , which are characteristic of gas temperatures of @xmath9  k. because gas phase h@xmath0o requires warm conditions ( @xmath10  k ) it is expected to be abundant at small radii and thus perhaps not observable with the _ herschel _ spectrometers .",
    "however , temperatures appropriate to both the occurrence and detection of h@xmath0o are present over a wide range of radii because stellar radiation heats the disk atmosphere . moreover , as we show in this letter , several lines of h@xmath0o can be detected by _",
    "herschel _ at very low abundances close to the mid - plane where the bulk of the water is frozen .",
    "the detection of these lines will complement the previous measurements of the near - infrared and mid - infrared water lines .",
    "the calculation is done as follows : ( 1 ) we use an x - ray irradiated disk code to calculate the temperature structure and molecular abundances for a generic t tauri disk .",
    "( 2 ) the results are input into a multi - zone radiative transfer code that includes the calculation of the excitation of the h@xmath0o lines . ( 3 ) a ray - tracing code is used to obtain line fluxes and line shapes .",
    "these three steps are discussed in more detail below .",
    "the thermal - chemical structure of the disk is calculated with the code described by @xcite with minor corrections and updates @xcite .",

    "the grain size @xmath27 determines the thermal coupling between dust and gas .",

    "our gas temperature is determined by heating by penetrating x - rays , gas - grain collisions and cooling by atomic and molecular lines .",
    "the gas thermal model relies solely on x - ray irradiation in contrast to uv irradiation models by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( who also include x - rays ) , who include uv photons .",
    "the uv irradiation , however , play no role in the regions where the submillimeter h@xmath0o emission is produced .",
    "the numerical approach is `` 1 + 1d '' , i.e. , the vertical thermal and chemical structure is calculated independently at 45 radial points whose spacing increases with radius .",
    "however , the x - ray attenuation is calculated along the line - of - sight to the star .",
    "the photons can only escape in the vertical direction , a reasonable approximation , since the opacities in the radial direction are so much larger .",
    "the chemistry is steady state and entirely gas phase , and it includes only carbon and oxygen bearing species .",
    "it does not treat freeze - out of h@xmath0o in detail , but we expect that freeze - out can not be 100% efficient .",
    "incomplete freeze - out has been observed by iso @xcite , and @xcite has modeled freeze - out in irradiated accretion disks . in order to treat the freeze - out of water , we assume a fixed gas - phase water abundance , @xmath28 or @xmath29 , in regions where most of the water is expected to freeze - out on grains , i.e. , where the gas temperature satisfies the condition @xmath30 with @xmath31  k , the adopted freeze - out temperature . where the model gas phase abundance is lower",
    ", we adopt the calculated abundance .",
    "a more realistic treatment of water freeze - out would involve treating many poorly understood physical processes beyond the scope of this short report .",
    "these might include the growth and settling of the dust grains , molecular synthesis and transformation on grain surfaces , adsorption and desorption , and mixing .",
    "we are developing an improved thermal - chemical disk model that will address many of these issues .",
    "the advantage of the present model is that it allows us to isolate the chemical effects of freeze - out and the effects of grain growth and settling in a simple albeit preliminary way .",
    "the critical densities of the lines of interest are typically large , in the range @xmath32  @xmath33 .",
    "the fractional abundance of gaseous water becomes significant at perpendicular column densities @xmath34  @xmath35 ( fig.[temp_and_abun ] ) , and the excitation can be sub - thermal , especially at large radii ( @xmath36  au ) . thus assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium is not always a good approximation , and a full radiation transfer calculation is required .",
    "we calculate the level populations of h@xmath0o using the multi - zone escape probability method @xmath373d described by @xcite .",
    "we assume keplerian rotation for a stellar mass @xmath17  m@xmath18 and turbulent velocities @xmath38=0.5 , and 2.0 km  s@xmath13 ( where @xmath39 is the @xmath40 half width of line profile ) . in the multi - zone formalism , the medium is divided into a large number of grid cells , each with calculated values of the volumetric hydrogen density , the temperatures of gas and dust , and the h@xmath0o abundance .",
    "the connection of every grid cell with all the others enables us to solve locally the equations of statistical equilibrium taking into account global information for the entire disk .",

    "we compute line profiles for inclinations ranging from @xmath41 to @xmath42 with the sky brightness distribution program sky , which is part of the ratran code @xcite .",
    "we use the 2-dimensional cylindrically - symmetric version of sky , and the resulting level populations , densities and molecular abundances are combined and rebinned into a single grid at each radius .",
    "the dynamical ranges of the physical and chemical properties are large in the vertical direction , and we use 400 cells in this direction and decrease the cell size toward the disk midplane .",
    "fewer grid cells are needed in the radial direction since the changes are more gradual , although smaller spacings are also used at small radii .",

    "para - h@xmath0o lines have similar integrated intensities , with line ratios @xmath75 .",
    "the small variations in this ratio , caused by high opacities in the lines , makes these lines unfavorable as diagnostics .    due to the rotation of the disk ,",
    "the lines are broadened with increasing inclination , but at increasingly smaller integrated intensities because of the reduction of the apparent surface area of the disk . for a completely edge on disk , absorption by the cold outer regions ( @xmath76",

    "the dominant contributions to the @xmath1 line flux originate therefore from @xmath81 to 100  au .",
    "thus this line provides no information on the snow line , which is located close to the star , near @xmath82  au in this model ( see fig .",
    "[ temp_and_abun ] ) .    at an inclination @xmath83 ( face - on disk )",
    ", the line width is determined by the turbulent velocity @xmath39 and the line opacity .",

    "thus one should be able to determine the width , and to some degree the shape of the @xmath1 ortho - h@xmath0o line .",
    "however , the effect of self - absorption due to high opacities will be hard to distinguish for low turbulent velocities ( @xmath94  km  s@xmath13 ) at this resolution .",
    "the para line is not a good candidate as the ortho transition for obtaining a line shape at the same noise level because of the decrease in sensitivity .",
    "the line profiles and integrated intensities of the @xmath1 and its ratio with the @xmath57 transition are affected by inclination angle , turbulent broadening , and the residual water vapor abundance after freeze - out .",
    "the dust opacity , which is influenced by grain growth and settling , can also play a role , although our study of these effects indicates that this is less important than the variables just mentioned .",
    "thus the models are degenerate in the sense that different parameter sets give the same line shapes and intensities , due to the high opacities in these lines .",
    "unfortunately , these are the only lines to be observed in the wish program . observing higher excitation transitions would help , but the decrease in sensitivity with frequency means that only line fluxes and not line shapes can be determined by _ herschel _ observations . at a velocity resolution of 1  km  s@xmath13 , it would take _ herschel _ about 4 hours to get the 1@xmath93 noise level down to 2  mk for transition frequencies around @xmath95  ghz . in a similar observation around @xmath96  ghz",

    "the model results for no freeze - out are found in the right upper part of the figure , where there are three segments for inclination @xmath83 , @xmath97 and @xmath88 ; each segment consists of two values of the turbulent velocity , @xmath98 and @xmath99  km  s@xmath13 .",
    "similar sets for @xmath100 ( middle part ) and @xmath101 ( left lower part ) are clearly in a different part of the diagram and do not overlap with each other .",
    "the variations due to inclination and turbulent velocity are smaller than those associated with freeze - out .",
    "we have shown that it should be possible to observe some far - infrared rotational lines of water with the hifi instrument on _ herschel _ that are produced in regions between radii @xmath102  au .",
    "the current scheduled observations of the @xmath1 and @xmath57 transitions would provide information on the spatial distribution of water and on turbulence if the inclination of the disk is known .",
