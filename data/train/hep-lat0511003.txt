    "a hermitian operator can be obtained by defining @xmath7 and it is clear that @xmath3 is a `` hamiltonian '' of a fermion moving in the random gauge field @xmath8 .",
    "dislocations in any given configuration @xmath8 can create bound states , and even zero modes @xcite , in the spectrum of @xmath3 . of course we do not study single configurations of @xmath8 but averages over an ensemble .",

    "a general overview , let s look at fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which shows how localization can appear as we go from free fermions ( i.e. , fixing @xmath9 ) to the fully fluctuating gauge field .",
    "we assume that the free operator @xmath3 has a gap for the parameters we choose ; above that gap lie plane - wave states .",
    "condensed - matter physicists call the top of the gap the band edge .",
    "if we add a single dislocation to the otherwise constant gauge field , the plane waves will be replaced by scattering states and a bound state might appear in the gap . a large number of dislocations will create a large number of bound states , and the scattering states will show effects of multiple scattering .",
    "in finite volume , the scattering states as well as the bound states form a discrete spectrum .    in the infinite volume limit , with a fixed density of dislocations , both the bound states and the scattering states form a continuum .",
    "the energy that separates the two is called the mobility edge .",
    "the infinite volume limit automatically gives us an average over the shapes and positions of the dislocations in any finite subvolume .",
    "alternatively , we can keep the volume finite and average over gauge field configurations ourselves , as is done in lattice gauge theory .",
    "@xmath3 can only have zero eigenvalues in the supercritical region , @xmath10 .",
    "as it happens , this includes the region of interest for the construction of domain - wall and overlap fermions .",
    "the aoki phase lies in this supercritical region ; we stay outside the aoki phase so that the mobility edge is above zero .",
    "we will present numbers @xcite below for @xmath11 .",
    "for the gauge couplings we choose , the theory lies between the aoki `` fingers . ''",
    "these couplings are in fact popular among users of domain - wall and overlap fermions .",
    "since averaging over the gauge field smears the energy eigenvalues , there is never a discrete spectrum of bound states accompanied by a continuum of extended states .",
    "the spectrum in the disordered system is described by a _ continuous _ density of states , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the energy eigenvalue .    , in lattice units , for @xmath14 ( @xmath15  gev , upper curve ) and @xmath16 ( @xmath17  gev , lower curve ) .",

    "[ we find it convenient to calculate @xmath18 via the identity @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the resolvent of @xmath3 .",
    "the mobility edge is where the averaged localization length @xmath21 ( see below ) diverges . ]",
    "the main point of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is to show that there is indeed a nonzero density of states at zero energy .",

    "will this destroy the locality of @xmath2 ?",
    "no  because ( outside the aoki phase ) these modes are localized . a bad condition number , and make it difficult to calculate the overlap kernel via various approximations to eq .",
    "( [ dov ] ) .",
    "see for instance refs .",
    "a localized mode can be described by its support length @xmath24 , which is the size of the region that contains most of the mode s density ; and by its localization length @xmath25 , which is the decay length of any long - range tail ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "each can be averaged over all eigenmodes with eigenvalue @xmath13 , giving @xmath21 and @xmath26 .",
    "[ fig3 ]    the average support length can be used to determine in what range of @xmath13 the localized modes are dilute . in view of the mode density shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , it is clear that low - lying modes will be dilute while the higher modes will be more crowded . the average localization length , on the other hand , will directly affect the decay rate of green functions of @xmath3 .",
    "we turn @xcite to these green functions to calculate both @xmath21 and @xmath26 .",
    "we define a `` meson '' green function as a pair propagator , @xmath27 where the complex variable @xmath28 .",
    "introduction of @xmath13 will enable us to focus on the contributions of eigenfunctions with eigenvalue near @xmath13 ; the imaginary part @xmath29 is a regulator that is put in to avoid the singularities on the real axis due to these eigenfunctions .",
    "the spectral representation of @xmath30 is a double sum , @xmath31 in the limit @xmath32 it diverges as @xmath33 ; the divergence comes from the terms where @xmath34 , and thus we are left with a single sum , @xmath35 the @xmath32 limit has thus brought out the eigenmode densities @xmath36 .",
    "the limit also focuses on modes with @xmath37 , since the fraction within the bracket approaches a delta function as @xmath32 .",
    "now we set @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and sum over the spatial coordinate * y*. this gives the correlation function @xmath40 between spatial slices .",
    "taking finally the @xmath32 limit , we find @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the distribution of localization lengths among the modes with eigenvalue @xmath13 .",
    "the tail of @xmath40 thus gives an average of the tails of the mode densities @xmath36 , and the average @xmath43 can serve as an estimate of the localization length @xmath21 . by definition",
    ", @xmath21 diverges at @xmath44 , the mobility edge .",
    "clearly this happens when the modes at @xmath13 become extended , meaning they have spread across the lattice .    the same tools",
    "give us an estimate of the average support length @xmath26 .",
    "if a given ( normalized ) mode density @xmath36 takes a value @xmath45 over a region of linear size @xmath24 , then @xmath46&&+o(m_1),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which approaches @xmath47 as @xmath32 .",
    "thus we obtain an estimate of the average support length .",
    "comparing @xmath26 to @xmath48 , which is the mean distance between localized modes , tells us whether the modes at @xmath13 overlap with each other or whether they are dilute .",
    "the dilute , the less dilute , and the extended modes all contribute to the overlap kernel @xmath2 .",
    "the contribution of the dilute localized modes , those below some energy @xmath49 , is of the form @xmath50    & \\approx & \\bar\\lambda \\rho(\\bar\\lambda )    \\exp\\left(-{|x - y|\\over 2l_\\ell(\\bar\\lambda)}\\right),\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second line follows from the steep rise in @xmath51 seen in fig .",
    "note that these isolated modes contribute an exponential tail characterized by their localization length ; their low energy is harmless .",
    "the dense modes are up near the mobility edge @xmath52 ; if we lump them with the extended modes then we can estimate that the fall - off of their contribution will be governed by @xmath52 , viz .",
    "@xmath53 where @xmath54 is @xmath55 .",
    "let s put in numbers for the plaquette action at @xmath16 .",
    "we measure the mobility edge to be at @xmath56 and we fix the demarcation point to be @xmath57 .",
    "the result is @xmath58    & & + { { \\cal o}(1)}\\cdot \\exp\\left(-{|x - y|\\over { 2.4}}\\right ) .    \\label{range}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second term , governed by the mobility edge , wins  both in prefactor and in exponent .",
    "we find this to be true in all the cases ( actions and couplings ) we have studied , including those in table 1",
    ". the reverse could be true in other cases ; then the range of @xmath2 would be determined by the representative localization length , @xmath59 .",
    "the fact that the gap is zero would still be harmless .",
    "we can interpret @xmath52 as a mass scale , the mass of effective excitations that influence the overlap kernel .",
    "when the cutoff is @xmath17  gev , we find that @xmath60  mev for all three actions .",
    "it may be a disappointment to find that the cutoff is felt at an energy that is so low , but this is still well above @xmath61 which is the true dynamical scale .",
    "one ought to worry , however , at stronger couplings . when @xmath15  gev , the value of @xmath62 comes out to be only 250320  mev , not a place we would like to see unphysical particles in the spectrum .",
    "the three main lessons of our work :    1 .",
    "the mobility edge at @xmath63 [ or @xmath59 , if it is greater than @xmath64 assures a finite range for @xmath2 , even though @xmath3 has no gap in the disordered gauge field .",
    "2 .   one should demand that @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath62 is fairly insensitive to the gauge action ( at fixed cutoff ) , even as @xmath22 varies widely .",
    "the third point emerges from numerical results @xcite that are not presented here ; it implies , according to our arguments , that the range of the overlap kernel will be equally insensitive to the gauge action .",
    "this has already been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ; moreover , the range of @xmath2 given there for @xmath66  gev agrees well with our estimate , shown in eq .",
    "( [ range ] ) above .",
    "it is curious that the range given for the overlap kernel when @xmath67  gev in ref .",
    "@xcite is much shorter ( by a factor of 4 ) than our estimate would indicate .",
    "the reason for this is an interesting open question .",
    "i have not discussed the implications of localization for domain - wall fermions , where it would govern both the range of the equivalent overlap - like kernel and the residual mass due to finiteness of the fifth dimension in practical calculations @xcite .",
