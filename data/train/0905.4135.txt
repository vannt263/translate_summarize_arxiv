    "this paper is concerned with time - reversal symmetry in dynamical systems with finite phase space , with applications to rational maps over finite fields .",
    "the concept of reversibility originated in the theory of smooth maps and flows on manifolds @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "a map @xmath1 is said to be _",
    "reversible _ if it is the composition of two involutions @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the involution @xmath2 conjugates the map to its inverse , namely @xmath4 ( for background information on reversibility and its generalization , see @xcite , and references therein . ) the nature of the fixed sets of @xmath2 and @xmath5 , respectively @xmath6 and @xmath7 , plays a key dynamical role in organizing the dynamics of a reversible map .",
    "the reversibility property can be interpreted in purely algebraic terms , and in particular it applies to reversible algebraic maps @xmath1 of any dimension @xmath8 over any field @xmath9 , namely reversible maps defined by rational functions with coefficients in @xmath9 . if the field @xmath10 is a _ finite field _ with @xmath11 elements where @xmath11 is the power of a prime number @xmath12 we are led to the study of reversibility on a phase space with @xmath13 points .",
    "( for background reference on finite fields , see @xcite . )",
    "more meaningful is the case in which @xmath9 is an algebraic number field , e.g. , @xmath14 . the same map @xmath1",
    "may then be reduced over infinitely many distinct finite fields , of increasing size .",
    "we are concerned here with the case where the reductions of the component involutions @xmath2 and @xmath5 are involutory permutations of the phase space of @xmath13 points , so that the reduction of their composition @xmath1 yields a permutation of this space . in reduction ,",
    "the fixed sets @xmath6 and @xmath7 will now be finite .",
    "examples arising from dimension @xmath15 are the reversible planar polynomial automorphisms @xcite which include the well - known area - preserving hnon map @xmath16 , @xmath17 if @xmath18 , we find @xmath19    reversible polynomial automorphisms in any dimension provide other examples .",
    "but certain rational maps in @xmath8 dimensions can induce permutations , e.g. , @xmath20 of @xcite @xmath21 if @xmath18 , with @xmath22 , the denominator in @xmath23 is non - vanishing and @xmath24    the representability of @xmath2 and @xmath5 over a finite field @xmath25 imposes some restrictions on the parameters present in the involutions .",
    "for instance , if in , we take @xmath26 , say , we are led to consider the set @xmath27 of the prime divisors of the denominator of @xmath28 .",
    "then the involution @xmath29 is representable over any finite field whose characteristic is not in @xmath27 , such as the field of integers modulo a prime @xmath30 .",
    "additionally , one must verify that @xmath2 and @xmath5 remain involutions when reduced to a finite field .",
    "this is an instance of the property of _ good reduction _ ( for a discussion of reduction in arithmetic dynamics , see @xcite ) .",
    "representability assumed , the reduction of an algebraic map can be associated with interesting asymptotic phenomena , concerning the statistical behaviour of the periodic orbits in the large field limit . a main theme in this area of research is to ascertain whether such phenomena are _ universal , _ namely independent from the map , depending only on its structural properties e.g. , reversibility .",
    "furthermore , in reduction , the original dimension @xmath8 of the underlying algebraic map ceases to be important as the finite phase space does not inherit the topology of the continuum @xmath31 or @xmath32 .",
    "if the reduction of a reversible algebraic map is a permutation , it has been shown @xcite that over finite fields , reversibility manifests itself combinatorially .",
    "in particular , the number of symmetric periodic orbits those invariant under @xmath2 equals @xmath33 strong experimental evidence @xcite suggests that the symmetric periodic orbits dominate the statistics over the asymmetric ones , so that asymptotically counts the number of periodic orbits in the permutation .",
    "furthermore , numerical experiments @xcite suggest there exists an asymptotic ( large fields ) distribution of the periods of the orbits , given by @xmath34 ( in these experiments , ` large fields ' refers to the limit @xmath35 ; there are other asymptotic regimes , see remark ( 3 ) in section [ section : concludingremarks ] . ) the distribution ( [ eq : r ] ) describes the limiting probability of the set of points belonging to cycles with scaled period not exceeding @xmath36 .",
    "this distribution is believed to be universal , within the class of reversible maps with a single time - reversal symmetry . by contrast ,",
    "maps which are not reversible appear to behave like random permutations @xcite ; the associated distribution , also conjectured to be universal , is markedly different from that of reversible maps .",
    "finally , there are asymptotic period distributions for integrable systems @xcite .",
    "even though these distributions are map - dependent , they all feature a distinctive ` quantization ' of periods . with appropriate scaling ,",
    "the allowed periods occur at the reciprocals of the natural numbers , resulting in step - like distribution functions .",
    "these various asymptotic phenomena have led to the development of simple and effective tests for detecting integrability and reversibility in algebraic mappings @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a combinatorial model for the orbits , over a finite field , of a map with a single family of reversing symmetries .",
    "our model consists of the composition of two random involutions .",
    "the size @xmath37 of the space and the numbers @xmath38 and @xmath39 of fixed points of each involution are the parameters of the model . by letting @xmath37 increase",
    ", we build a sequence of probability spaces . under very general conditions , we derive the distribution ( [ eq : r ] ) found in @xcite .",
    "we prove the following theorem , which appears in section [ section : randominvolutions ] as theorems [ theorem : distribution ] and [ theorem : asymmetriccycles ] .",
    "* theorem a. * _ let @xmath40 be a pair of random involutions of a set @xmath41 with @xmath37 points , and let @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath44 be the expectation value of the portion of @xmath41 occupied by cycles of @xmath45 with period less than @xmath46 , computed with respect to the uniform probability .",
    "if , with increasing @xmath37 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 satisfy the conditions @xmath49 then for all @xmath50 , we have the limit @xmath51 , the distribution function in ( [ eq : r ] ) .",
    "moreover , almost all points in @xmath41 belong to symmetric cycles . _",
    "this result is formulated in terms of the sequence @xmath52 , and not of the two sequences individually .",
    "the conditions on the growth rate of @xmath52 are quite mild , hence the wide scope of applicability of the theorem .",
    "if @xmath47 and @xmath48 do not grow at the same rate , an interesting dynamical phenomenon occurs : asymptotically , almost all periodic orbits have even period ( corollary [ corollary : evenonly ] ) . for @xmath8-dimensional maps over the finite field @xmath25 , one has @xmath13 , while @xmath47 and @xmath48 will typically grow algebraically ( see remark 1 of section [ section : concludingremarks ] ) . as mentioned above ,",
    "increasing the dimension does not introduce new difficulties , because the absence of a significant topological structure makes the combinatorial model effectively dimension - independent .",
    "all that is needed is to keep track of the possible cardinalities of the fixed sets of the two involutions .    in @xcite , experimental evidence from reductions of",
    "the hnon map suggested that the probability of occurrence of several cycles with the same period followed a poisson law , with parameter depending exponentially on the ( rescaled ) period .",
    "these findings motivate the study of the statistics of the occurrence of repeated periods in the random involutions model . in section [ section : repetitions ] we consider this question , and prove the following result .",

    "we conclude section 3 by showing the agreement between the prediction of theorem b with the actual repetitions @xmath53 for a small @xmath55 in the hnon map .",
    "the latter are governed by the roots @xmath68 of certain polynomial functions of one variable , with a connection to the galois groups of these polynomials .    in section [ section : concludingremarks ]",
    "we discuss the question of the asymptotic ( large field ) growth rate of the parameters associated with a rational map over a finite field , namely the numbers @xmath47 and @xmath48 of fixed points of the involutions .",
    "in this case @xmath37 is the power of a prime number .",
    "we show that the growth conditions of theorem a on @xmath52 are easily satisfied , while @xmath69 in theorem b depends algebraically on @xmath37 , and all scenarios considered in the theorem can be realized .",
    "finally , we also sketch how the random involution model might be extended to the case of reversible rational maps with singularities .",

    "the main object under study is the distribution function @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the floor ( greatest integer part ) function , @xmath85 is a scaling parameter to be specified below , and the average @xmath86 is computed with respect to the uniform probability on @xmath87 ( i.e. , @xmath88 ) . if @xmath89 , the sum is empty , and @xmath44 is defined to be zero .",

    "_ case ii : @xmath242._from ( [ eq : estimatea ] ) we have @xmath243 ( kronecker s delta ) , and hence @xmath244 the proof of theorem b is complete .",

    ". a similar exercise on for @xmath157 using the appropriate @xmath251 from yields the result of theorem [ theorem : distributioneven ] and hence the distribution @xmath245 upon summation of odd and even contributions .",
    "we have chosen to give the independent proof of theorem a in section [ section : randominvolutions ] as it is simple and direct and bypasses the calculation of @xmath53 .",
    "the applicability of theorem b to algebraic maps over finite fields should be considered with care .",
    "for fixed @xmath55 , the maximum number of @xmath55-cycles for an algebraic map is plainly finite , because the points in a cycle are solutions of a set of polynomial equations ; therefore , in the large field limit , one can not possibly expect convergence to ( [ eq : muasymptotic ] ) . under what circumstances",
    "is then theorem b a model for such maps ?    to articulate this question ,",
    "let us consider a specific example , namely the hnon map ( [ eq : henon ] ) , with @xmath254 .",
    "the set @xmath6 is the line @xmath255 , and so over the field @xmath256 , this map has parameters @xmath257 , hence @xmath258 in theorem b. let us consider symmetric cycles , which , due to theorem a , are expected to dominate the dynamics . when the fixed sets are one - dimensional , the study of symmetric orbits is greatly simplified , because the points in these orbits are roots of polynomial equations in one indeterminate ( as opposed to being points on varieties ) .",
    "now , any symmetric odd cycle has a point @xmath259 on @xmath6 , and the values of @xmath36 for the period @xmath260 are found to be the roots of the irreducible polynomial @xmath261 thus the number of symmetric @xmath262-cycles over the field @xmath256 is equal to the number of linear factors in the factorization of @xmath263 modulo @xmath12 . in particular , the maximum number of 5-cycles is equal to 6 , the degree of @xmath263 .    in general , polynomial factorization over a finite field is a highly irregular process , subject only to a slight deterministic constraint stickelberger s theorem which determines the parity of the number of factors @xcite .",
    "significantly , this process is ruled by a probabilistic law cebotarev s density theorem which determines the probability associated with each factorization type ( number and degree of the factors ) in terms of properties of the galois group of the polynomial @xcite .",
    "specifically , for each factorization with distinct roots , the degree of the factors defines an additive partition of the degree of the polynomial .",
    "each partition in turn identifies uniquely a conjugacy class of the galois group , with the terms in the partition corresponding to cycle lengths in the cycle decompositions of the permutations in the class .",
    "the probability of a factorization type is then given by the relative size of the corresponding class in the galois group . if the galois group of @xmath264 is the symmetric group , the largest possible one , then every factorization type does actually occur , and with positive density among all primes .",
    "it can be verified that the galois group of @xmath263 is in fact @xmath265 , the set of all permutations of @xmath266 objects @xcite .",
    "there are therefore 11 possible types of factorizations of @xmath263 , corresponding to the 11 additive partitions of the integer 6 .",
    "we factor @xmath267 modulo a few consecutive primes @xmath268 these factorizations correspond to the partitions @xmath269 , respectively .",
    "we see that , over the field @xmath256 , the hnon map has six symmetric 5-cycles for @xmath270 ( the smallest prime for which this happens ) , no 5-cycles at all for @xmath271 , and two 5-cycles for @xmath272 .",
    "the degree of the polynomials @xmath273 grows exponentially with @xmath55 , and it is reasonable to expect that , typically , they will be irreducible , with large galois groups . for the symmetric group ,",
    "the cebotarev s probability @xmath274 of occurrence of @xmath54 symmetric cycles of period @xmath55 is just the probability of having exactly @xmath54 fixed points in the appropriate symmetric group , namely @xmath275 in the large @xmath55 limit , @xmath274 converges to @xmath276 , independent of @xmath55 .",
    "this agrees with the prediction of the random involution model .",
    "it is instructive to compare the data ( [ eq : cebotarev ] ) from cebotarev s theorem with the prediction of theorem b , for the period @xmath260 .",
    "we see that , even for such a low period , for @xmath277 the agreement is already reasonable .",
    "thus , in the two - dimensional case , some statements on the probability of multiple occurrences of symmetric @xmath55-cycles translate into statements on the maximality of the galois groups of @xmath273 .",
    "even though this formulation would allow one to re - cast some dynamical questions in algebraic terms , we note that problems related to galois groups of iterated polynomials are often quite difficult .",
    "when the reduction over a finite field of a reversible algebraic map with a single family of reversing symmetries is a permutation , numerical experiments suggest the period distribution function is given by the period distribution function @xmath245 of . in this paper",
    ", we have shown that @xmath245 corresponds to the expected period distribution function in a probability space of pairs of involutions characterized by the cardinalities of their fixed sets .",
    "we find that the same probability space furnishes a poisson law for the probability of cycles with the same period , also in agreement with numerics .      *",
    "( 1 ) * to prove theorem a , only mild regularity conditions the existence of the limits ( [ eq : ghasymptotics ] )  were imposed on the behaviour of the sequences @xmath278 , @xmath279 , specifying the cardinalities of the fixed sets of the two involutions , as the size @xmath13 of the phase space increases ( with @xmath8 the dimensionality of the map ) .",
    "similarly , theorem b involves checking the behaviour of the sequence @xmath69 in .",
    "we point out that when a reversible map of a finite set is obtained by reducing an algebraic mapping to a finite field , the behaviour of such sequences is strongly constrained , resulting in algebraic growth .",
    "a simple but significant case comprises maps for which the fixed set @xmath6 is an affine subspace of some linear space .",
    "an example is given by two - dimensional reversible polynomial automorphisms over some field @xmath9 , where the existence of a normal form for the two involutions ensures that their fixed set is a single point or a line @xcite .",
    "localization to the finite field @xmath25 gives a phase space with @xmath280 points , and since a line in the affine plane @xmath281 has @xmath11 points , we have an algebraic growth : @xmath282 . in dimension @xmath283 , each of @xmath6 and @xmath7 can have integer dimension ranging from 0 to @xmath284 , and if these sets are affine spaces , we obtain the sequence @xmath285 , with @xmath286 , @xmath287 .",
    "the conditions are then met as long as one of @xmath288 or @xmath289 is nonzero , i.e. as long as one of @xmath6 and @xmath7 is at least one - dimensional .",
    "furthermore , in this situation , we see from that @xmath290 or @xmath291 .",
    "so either @xmath292 ( e.g. , when @xmath293 ) or @xmath294 algebraically or @xmath295 algebraically .    more generally , the sets @xmath6 and @xmath7 are algebraic varieties over @xmath25 determined by @xmath8 polynomial equations , and we are interested in determining the number of points on these varieties .",
    "the number @xmath296 of points on an @xmath288-dimensional irreducible algebraic variety in the @xmath8-dimensional projective space of degree @xmath283 over the field @xmath25 satisfies the hasse - weil bound @xcite @xmath297 .",
    "for @xmath298 we obtain a square root bound , and we can also replace @xmath299 by the genus of the curve .",
    "the result ensures that , in the large field limit , there is algebraic growth of the cardinality of fixed sets .",
    "so the discussion of the previous paragraph applies concerning the validity of the asymptotic conditions ( [ eq : ghasymptotics ] ) and the behaviour of @xmath69 .    * ( 2 ) * experiments show that algebraic maps without time - reversal symmetry behave quite differently from reversible ones , when represented on a finite field @xcite . in the absence of reversibility , the cycle distribution is found to be that of a random permutation , given by the identity function on the unit interval .",
    "this distribution , obtained via the scaling @xmath300 , has led to a general conjecture ( * ? ? ? * conjecture 2 ) .    * ( 3 ) * when a general rational reversible map is reduced over finite fields , we expect that points where the denominators vanish ( singularities ) will occur .",
    "restricted to its periodic points , the reduced map is still a permutation .",
    "numerically , we find the distribution of periods is still governed by @xmath245 , consistent with theorem a @xcite .",
    "but nonperiodic orbits will also appear in the reduction of such a map .",
    "we are presently investigating the extension of the random involution model to explain various aspects of the dynamics of the reduction to finite fields of general rational reversible maps @xcite .",
    "we are also extending our numerical experiments to cover the asymptotic regime @xmath25 , @xmath301 , @xmath302 .",
