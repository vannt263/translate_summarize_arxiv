    "the detailed structure of the inner parts of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) : the black hole , accretion disk and broad emission line regions ( blrs ) , can not be resolved by direct observations , with the possible exception of indirect evidence from a dusty torus in the nucleus of ngc4261 . the use of reverberation mapping ( peterson 1993 ; netzer & peterson 1997 ; blandford & mckee 1982 ) requires the assumption of a rough geometric structure for the blrs in order to explain the correlation between the variations of broad emission lines and those of continuum . moreover",
    ", the problem of spatially resolving these regions , will not be solved in the foreseeable future . up until now",
    ", the best approach is the detailed study of broad line profile shapes and asymmetries from high s / n spectra ( sulentic et al .",
    "2000 ; marziani , dultzin - hacyan & sulentic 2006 ) .",
    "there are at least three special types of agn where the observed phenomenology has suggested the presence of a binary black hole system ( bbh ) in the center : ( 1 ) blazars with periodical brightness variations , ( 2 ) agn with x - shaped radio structures ( x - shaped agn ) , and ( 3 ) double - peaked broad low - ionization line ( dbp ) emitters .    in the prototypical case of the periodically varying blazar oj 287 ( sillanp et al .",

    "( 1988 ) and lehto & valtonen ( 1996 ) modeled the periodic outbursts by relating them to tidally induced mass flows from the accretion disks in a bbh system with an orbital period of 8.9 years ( in the rest frame of oj 287 ) .",

    "the first natural explanation for the appearance of double peaked emission lines was also a bbh model ( begelman et al .",
    "1980 ; gaskell 1983 ) . another model of bipolar outflow was proposed by zheng et al .",
    "the most successful model involved lines originating from an accretion disk to explain not only the appearance , but also the observed variations of double - peaked emission lines ( chen et al .",

    "an important reason to give up the initial bbh model was the unreasonable bh masses derived from the variations of the broad emission lines for three dbp emitters ( eracleous et al .",
    "1997 ) . in the case of the bipolar outflow model ,",
    "the observed variations could not be explained .",
    "another special kind of agn , x - shaped agn , are classified according to their extended radio morphology .",
    "one of the first explanations for the distortion of radio structures , particularly for x - shaped and z - shaped agn , was backflow material dominating the bridge regions ( leahy & williams 1984 ; worrall et al .",
    "more recently , other models have also been developed to explain the distortions , such as the precession of jet axis in a bbh system .",
    "it should be noticed that in the case of oj287 ( the first confirmed periodically varying blazar ) , the bending of the vlbi jet was first reported by vicente et al .",
    ". objects with bending , misalignment , and wiggling of extragalactic radio jets ( often associated with knots superluminally moving along different - scale curved trajectory ) , have been interpreted in terms of helical structures of the jets .",

    "2003 ) . here , we used the method from hao et al .",
    "the eigenspectra are calculated by kl ( karhunen - loeve ) transform for about 926 pure absorption galaxies selected from sdss dr2 .",
    "then , the first eight eigenspectra and the spectrum of an a star are used to fit the absorption properties of the observed spectrum .",
    "a power law is used to fit the continuum from the nuclei .",
    "the line spectrum of sdss j1130 + 0058 , after the subtraction of the stellar component and power law continuum , are show in figure 2 .",
    "the stellar components and the power law continuum are also shown in the figure .",
    "the best fitted results for absorption lines , such as the caii@xmath6 doublet , indicate that the subtraction of stellar components is reliable . as discussed in wang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , there is apparent broad h@xmath0 emission line and weak broad h@xmath7 emission line in line spectrum .",
    "after the subtraction of the stellar light and continuum , the emission line parameters are measured .",
    "the line parameters were listed in wang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , however , new eigenspectra and new observed spectrum from sdss dr4 are used here , thus , we re - measured the emission lines and list our new line parameters in table 1 .",
    "we fit each narrow emission line by a narrow gaussian function . for [ oiii]@xmath8 doublet , there are other two gaussian functions for each line , because of the asymmetry of [ oiii]@xmath8 . due to the weakness of broad h@xmath7 , we use the broad component of h@xmath0 to fit broad h@xmath7 .",
    "first , we obtain the broad component of h@xmath0 after the subtraction of narrow h@xmath0 , [ nii]@xmath9 and [ sii]@xmath10 within the wavelength range from 6400@xmath11 to 6800@xmath11 . in order to get more accurate narrow components near h@xmath0 , there are two broad gaussian functions to fit the broad h@xmath0",
    ". then the narrow components near h@xmath0 according to the best fitted results are subtracted from the observed line spectrum .",
    "we have assumed that broad h@xmath7 and h@xmath0 have the same line profiles , thus we can estimate the flux ratio of broad h@xmath0 to h@xmath7 .",
    "the best fitted results for h@xmath0 are shown in figure 3 .",
    "figure 4 shows the best fitted results for h@xmath7 by scaling of the observed broad h@xmath0 .    the object sdss j1130 + 0058 , has been considered as a dbp emitter in the sample of dbp emitters by strateva et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in our new sample of dbp emitters",
    "( zhang et al . in preparation ) from sdss dr4 , this object also is a dbp emitter . for preliminary definition of criteria",
    "see also zhang , dultzin - hacyan & wang ( 2007 ) .",
    "the radio image at 20 cm for sdss j1130 + 0058 can be extracted from faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeter survey ( first , becker , white & helfand 1995 ) , which is shown in figure 5 . the apparent x - shaped radio morphology can be seen .",
    "there are four regions which strongly emit radio power as listed in table 2 . as discussed in wang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the smallest offset of the photometric center from the four radio regions is about 4.5 arcseconds which is larger than the position uncertainty of sdss and first , which indicates that the central component may be a component from the jet rather than the radio core . the total integral radio power at 20 cm for sdss j1130 + 0058 is about @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , one fundamental parameter of a radio jet , the age of the jet , is important to understand the physical processes in the forming the jet .",
    "there are many papers that discuss the age of a jet , including the dynamical and spectral age .",
    "alexander & leahy ( 1987 ) firstly proposed the method to measure the spectral age of a radio jet ( the same methods can be found in leahy et al .",
    "1989 ; liu et al . 1992",
    "; params et al . 1999 ) .",
    "spectral age depends on the break frequency @xmath13 , which can be calculated by the spectral index at different frequencies in various regions .",
    "the more accurate dynamical age is more difficult to calculate and depends on the model of dynamical expansion ( kaiser & alexander 1997 ; kaiser 2000 ; kaiser et al . 1997 ; parma et al . 1999 ; machalski et al .",
    "2006 ; tudose et al , 2006 ; kino & kawakatu 2005 ) .",
    "the limit on the radio data is not enough to calculate the accurate age .",
    "however , we can determine which one is older .",
    "machalski et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have found there is a strong linear correlation between spectral age and dynamical age ( dynamical age is about two times the spectral age ) .",
    "the spectral age @xmath14 can simply depend on the distance between the lobe edge and the core @xmath15 : @xmath16 , considering the relation between @xmath15 and @xmath13 shown in parma et al .",
    "thus as a simple empirical result , we can say that the double - jet in the n - s direction is older than the one in e - w direction , because of the longer projected distance in n - s direction .",
    "the internal reddening factor can be determined by the value of the balmer decrement .",
    "the flux ratios of the balmer emission lines are about 3.78 and 6.52 for the narrow and broad components respectively .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that the intrinsic balmer decrement is not a definitive value for agn , because case b recombination is not necessarily valid ( particularly for the blr ) .",
    "the value of 3.1 can be expected by case b recombination . from a sample of quasars with smaller contribution from the host galaxy , the mean",
    "value is about 3.5 ( greene & ho , 2005b ) . if we assume the intrinsic balmer decrement as 3.1 , the internal reddening factors are about e(b - v)=0.64 for the broad balmer emission lines , and e(b - v ) = 0.17 for the narrow balmer emission lines .",
    "the balmer decrement is not as large as the one determined by wang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .    in order to verify",
    "if the internal reddening factor leads to luminosities which agree with well established scaling relations , we have used the tight correlation between continuum luminosity at 5100@xmath11 and the luminosity of h@xmath0 found by greene & ho ( 2005b ) .",
    "the observed luminosity of h@xmath0 including the narrow component of h@xmath0 is about 1.16@xmath17 ( @xmath18 for broad component and @xmath19 for narrow component ) .",
    "the continuum luminosity at 5100@xmath11 from the nucleus can be measured from the power law continuum , @xmath20 .",
    "the total continuum luminosity at 5100@xmath11 from the observed spectrum is approximately @xmath21 . after",
    "the internal reddening correction with @xmath22 , the intrinsic continuum luminosity at 5100@xmath11 from the nucleus is about @xmath23 , and the intrinsic luminosity l@xmath24 is about @xmath25 ( the luminosity of narrow h@xmath0 has been corrected by the factor e(b - v)=0.17 ) .",
    "the relation between the corrected values are consistent with the expectation from the correlation found by greene & ho ( 2005b ) : @xmath26    this consistency confirms that the method of subtracting stellar components is valid and the calculated internal reddening factor is a reasonable estimate .",
    "sdss j1130 + 0058 is indeed an obscured agn with intermediate internal reddening . the smaller value for internal reddening found in this paper ( as compared to wang et al .",
    "2003 ) implies a smaller amount of internal dust , and thus a lower density for the internal regions .",
    "however , the backflow model requires a higher gas pressure in the direction of the galaxy , as shown in other x - shaped radio sources there are nearly no detectable broad emission lines because of the higher internal reddening .",
    "this does not favor the backflow model for the x - shaped radio structure in sdss j1130 + 0058 .",
    "there are mainly two methods to estimated the central bh masses : one is from the correlation between the masses of the bulge and the central black hole following the strong correlation between bh masses and stellar velocity dispersion ( tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ; ferrarese & merritt 2001 ; gebhardt , bender et al . 2000 ) ( or line width of narrow emission lines , greene & ho 2005a ; nelson & whittle 1995 , 1996 ; nelson 2000 ) , and the correlation between absolute magnitude of the bulge and bh masses ( kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ) etc . the other one is from the assumption of virialization ( kaspi et al . 2000 ; peterson & wandel 1999 ; peterson et al .",
    "2004 ; onken et al . 2004",
    "; sulentic et al . 2006 ) , based on the line width of broad emission lines and the size of broad emission line regions estimated from continuum luminosity ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ; 2005 ) . as shown in kazantzidis et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the central masses of merging galaxies should also obey the strong correlation between bh masses and stellar velocity dispersions , if they undergo a dissipational process with star formation mergers .",
    "moreover , according to the hierarchical merging model , we think the bbh system is common in the center of agn . even in the sample used to obtain the strong relation @xmath27 ( tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ; ferrarese & merritt 2001 ; gebhardt , bender et al . 2000 ) , we can not discard the possibility that the centers of the objects have bbh system . thus , whether there is a bbh system in the center of sdss j1130 + 0058 or not , we estimate the bh masses from stellar velocity dispersions .",
    "how to measure accurately stellar velocity dispersions is an open question , because of the known problem about the template mismatch .",
    "a commonly used method is to select spectra of several kinds of stars ( commonly , g and k ) as templates , and then broaden the templates by the same velocity to fit stellar features , leaving the contributions from different kinds of stars as free parameters ( rix & whit 1992 ) .",
    "however , more information about stars included by the templates should lead to more accurate measurement of stellar features . according to the above",
    "mentioned fitting method , we selected a new template rather than several spectra of g or k stars as templates .",
    "the method of principle component analysis ( pca ) provides a better way to constrict more favorable information from a series of spectra of stars into several eigenspectra .",
    "thus , we apply pca method for 255 spectra of different kinds of stars in stelib . selecting the first several eigenspectra and a three - order polynomial function for the background as templates , the value of the stellar velocity dispersion can be measured by means of the method of minimum @xmath28 fit .",
    "figure 6 shows the fitted results for the stellar features near mgib@xmath29 by means of the eigenspectra with broadening velocity @xmath30 .",
    "the error in the stellar velocity dispersion is determined from the different numbers of required eigenspectra . here , 4 to 8 eigenspectra are used to fit the stellar features .",
    "the central bh masses of sdss j1130 + 0058 can be estimated as @xmath31 by ( tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ; ferrarese & merritt 2001 ; gebhardt , bender et al .",
    "2000 ) : @xmath32 moreover , we should select another parameter to estimate the central bh masses .",
    "the convenient way is to select the line width of narrow emission lines to trace the stellar velocity dispersion in the bulge . from the line widths of narrow emission lines listed in table 1 , the minimum value of line width ( @xmath33 ) is 103.3@xmath34 for h@xmath35 and the maximum value is 175.6@xmath34 for [ oii]@xmath36 .",
    "thus , we can estimated the bh masses as @xmath37 by the relation of @xmath27 , which is consistent with the value from stellar velocity dispersion and confirms the strong correlation between stellar velocity dispersion and line width of narrow emission lines .",
    "the virial bh masses are based on the empirical relation between the size of blrs and continuum luminosity .",
    "however , the broad emission lines of sdss j1130 + 0058 have special double - peaked profiles .",
    "thus , either under the accretion disk model or under the bbh model , the size of blrs of the object should not obey the empirical relation @xmath38 .    for accretion rate , we can determine the dimensionless accretion rate based on the bolometric luminosity and eddington luminosity to trace the accretion rate .",
    "the bolometric luminosity for agn with normal spectral energy distribution , such as normal big blue bump , can be determined by the continuum luminosity @xmath39 .",
    "the eddington luminosity can be determined by @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the dimensionless accretion rate can be determined as @xmath41 , which is larger than the critical accretion rate for adaf ( mahadevan & quataert 1997 ; narayan et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ; mahadevan 1997 ) .",
    "first , we check whether the bbh model can be valid for sdss j1130 + 0058 . from the best fitted results shown in figure 3 , double - gaussian functions",
    "can completely reproduce the observed double - peaked broad h@xmath0 . if the bbh model is valid , the observed radial velocity of each peak of each broad component of h@xmath0 represents the rotating velocity in the line of sight , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . here",
    ", the minus means the component is moving toward us .",
    "then the mass ratio of the two central bh masses can be roughly determined by @xmath44 , if the separation between the central two black holes is much larger than the distance between blrs and each corresponding black hole . here",
    ", @xmath45 represents the black hole with larger bh mass .",
    "however , whether the relation @xmath27 is valid for merging galaxies depends on whether the merger is dissipative or colisionless ( kazantzidis et al . 2005 ) .",
    "thus , we determine the bh masses using another method , before considering the total bh masses from stellar velocity dispersion . we can estimate the bh masses of central two black holes under the correlation @xmath46 found by peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which is consistent with the mass ratio from the ratio of rotating velocity .",
    "the continuum luminosity of each black hole + blrs system can be estimated from the luminosity of each broad component of h@xmath0 by equation 1 , because of the small contributions from narrow components of h@xmath0 . under the binary black hole system model",
    ", there is another parameter of projected angle of the orbital velocity to determine the structure of each blr except the inclination angle of the orbit , thus we select the correlation between @xmath46 rather than eq 2 .",
    "the total bh masses , @xmath49 , determined from each broad h@xmath0 is similar to bh masses @xmath50 estimated from stellar velocity dispersion , which is consistent with the predicted result for merging galaxies by kazantzidis et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .    under the assumption of the bbh model",
    ", we accept the bh masses estimated from each broad h@xmath0 for each black hole .",
    "we can roughly estimate the separation of the central two black holes by :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the separation between the central two black holes , @xmath53 is the inclination angle of the rotating plane , @xmath54 is the projected angle of the orbital velocity , @xmath55 is the angular speed , @xmath56 is the observed rotating velocity in the line of sight of the clouds in blrs including @xmath45 . from the equations above , we can determine the upper limit value of the separation @xmath52 : @xmath57 , and the upper limit value of orbital period @xmath58 : @xmath59 .",
    "however , the size of each blr can be determined by ( wang & zhang 2003 ) : @xmath60    the sizes of blrs are about 45.1 light - days and 79.4 light - days for each blr , which turns out larger than the maximum value of separation . in order to keep the completeness of each blr",
    ", the sizes of the blrs should not be larger than the separation of the two black holes .",
    "this poses some problem to the bbh model for sdss j1130 + 0058 .",
    "it has to be stressed , however , that the standard way to determine blr sizes , may not be applicable for a bbh system .",
    "another model , the accretion disk model has been applied to explain the double - peaked h@xmath0 .",
    "here , we select elliptical accretion disk model ( eracleous et al .",
    "1995 ) , because of the number of free parameters in the model which is less than those required by the circular accretion disk plus spiral arms model .",

    "the local broadening velocity is about @xmath67 . according to the eccentricity ,",
    "the period of the inner emission regions can be estimated as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the central bh masses in unit of @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the radius in unit of @xmath72 .",
    "more information , particularly about the variations of double - peaked broad @xmath73 to determine the time scale and other characteristics of the variations of the lines is needed to verify whether the bbh model is valid for sdss j1130 + 0058 . from the theoretical side , a detailed model of",
    "the combined accretion disk emission from two accretion disks is yet to be developed .",
    "the only x - shaped radio source with apparent double - peaked broad emission lines , sdss j1130 + 0058 , is indeed an internally obscured agn with standard continuum luminosity of a seyfert 1 galaxy .",
    "the presence of internal dust may provide a convenient background for the backflow of material to produce x - shaped radio structures .",
    "but in this paper we found a smaller value of the reddening ( and thus of the dust contents ) than previously reported . we are not in the position to quantitatively support nor reject the backflow model , however a natural alternative is the bbh model .",
    "objects with x - shaped extragalactic radio jets may be the signature of these binary systems .    a bbh system can also account for the observed dbp balmer emission lines . except for the problem with the sizes of the blrs ,",
    "the separation between the two black holes under the assumption of bbh model , is consistent with the theoretical expectation by merritt & ekers ( 2002 ) , who found that the separation of the two black holes should be about 0.01 pc to 1 pc in a time shorter than 1 gyr , if the coalescence rate of binary black holes is comparable to the galaxy merger rate . under the bbh model , the separation of central black holes for sdss j1130 + 0058 is about less than 0.04 pc . from the results of a single observation , we can not rule out the bbh model . moreover , the periods of bbh model and accretion disk model are very different , one is about 230 years and the other less than 59 years , so that long term observations are necessary to understand sdss j1130 + 0058 better .",
    "furthermore , the bbh model and accretion disk model will predict different variation patterns of broad h@xmath0 .",
    "the bbh model leads to radial velocity of each peak varying in period .",
    "on the other hand , the accretion disk model can not lead to the same result .",
    "long term monitoring should provide more information to discriminate which model for sdss j1130 + 0058 is favored .",
    "there is another possibility within the bbh system scenario to explain the double - peaked broad emission lines and the x - shaped radio structures .",
    "the double - peaked broad emission lines are coming from the accretion disk of only one of the two central black holes .",
    "there is no blr around the other black hole .",
    "otherwise , there would be three or more components of broad h@xmath0 .",
    "the x - shaped radio - structures are produced by the precession of the jet .",
    "the main effect of the existence of the second black hole is to produce the precession of the radio jet with respect to the accretion disk . in this case",
    ", the predicted behavior is that the center wavelength of broad h@xmath0 should vary in period , besides the variation of line profiles .",

    "<S> in this paper we study the object sdss j1130 + 0058 which is the only agn known to have both double - peaked low - ionization broad emission lines , and also x - shaped radio structures . </S>",
    "<S> emission from an accretion disk can reproduce the double - peaked line profile of broad h@xmath0 , but not the radio structure . under the accretion disk model , </S>",
    "<S> the period of the inner emission line region is about 230 years . using a new method to subtract the stellar component from the data of the sdss dr4 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain an internal reddening factor which is less than previously found . the implied smaller amount of dust disfavors the backflow model for the x - shaped radio structure . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a binary black hole ( bbh ) system is the most natural way to explain @xmath1 the optical and radio properties of this agn . under the assumption of the bbh model </S>",
    "<S> , we can estimate the bbh system has a separation of less than 0.04 pc with a period less than 59 years , this may pose some problem to the blrs sizes , still we conclude that the bbh model is favored on the basis of the present limited information .    </S>",
