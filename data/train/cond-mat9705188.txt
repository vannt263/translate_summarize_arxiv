    "<S> the confining potential , flat in the interior of the channel , is assumed smooth on the magnetic length @xmath2 scale but sufficiently steep at the edges that the density profile is sharp and the dissipation considered results only from electron _ intraedge - intralevel _ transitions due to scattering by piezoelectrical phonons . for wide channels there exist independent emp modes spatially symmetric and antisymmetric with respect to the edge . </S>",
