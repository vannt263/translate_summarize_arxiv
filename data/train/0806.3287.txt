    ", these variations can not be interpreted only in terms of differences in the amount of produced .",
    "the velocity scatter could be due to properties of the progenitor system that impact on the kinetic energy released during the explosion .",
    "for example , the ratio ( @xmath4fe+@xmath5ni)/@xmath6ni has been proposed as a second physical parameter which could account for this dispersion @xcite .    this paper is an attempt to unravel the spectral formation in the @xmath7  region ( henceforth the @xmath0  wavelength region ) , as a way to address the physical reasons for their correlation with luminosity , and especially the link between this correlation and the temperature sequence of sne  ia .",
    "a previous attempt using the radiative transfer code synow@xcite , was performed by @xcite who explained the counter - intuitive correlation of @xmath0  with luminosity by the temperature sensitivity of a  line . on the other hand synthetic spectral investigations @xcite failed to find any important  line contributions in this part of the spectrum .",
    "we use the radiative transfer code ` phoenix `  differently than it has usually been used previously . instead of fitting a supernova by varying the time and bolometric luminosity , we use a grid of simulated models to probe the line formation process .",
    "our input model is the parametrized deflagration model w7 @xcite , homologously expanded to calculate the abundances at any given time .",
    "the knowledge of the abundance structure of the explosion model , and the self - consistent physical structure provided by ` phoenix `  are used to describe more precisely how the spectrum is formed in sne  ia .",
    "@xcite introduced the line ratio @xmath8 , which is defined as the ratio of two integrals of the flux over a chosen wavelength range , where each integral is centered around the two lines used in the original definition of @xmath0  ( see  [ rsisdef ] ) .",
    "it is designed to be useful for spectra which have lower signal to noise than well - observed nearby sne  ia .",
    "this understanding of the formation of the spectrum allows us to explain why the line ratio @xmath8  is a good probe of the temperature sequence , and reinforces the link between this sequence and the absolute blue magnitude of sne  ia .",
    "these results also allow us to rule out a  contribution to the correlation of @xmath0  with luminosity .",
    "we emphasize that even though the synthetic spectra presented here _ do not _ do a good job of reproducing observed sne  ia spectra , we consider w7 to be the fiducial sne  ia model .",
    "@xcite showed that reasonably good synthetic spectra can be produced with w7 near maximum light .",
    "we make differential comparisons based on that model , keeping in mind that @xcite emphasized that w7 did not reproduce the wavelength region that we examine in detail here .",
    "we will address time evolution only qualitatively .",
    "the goal of this paper is to understand the temperature sequence of sne  ia spectra around maximum light , thus we concentrated on day 20 after explosion , since maximum light in @xmath9 in sne  ia has been shown to occur 1825 days after explosion .",
    "using the multi - purpose radiative transfer code ` phoenix `  we converged lte calculations for the w7  explosion model at 10 , 15 , 20 , and 25 days after explosion , for a range of bolometric luminosities spanning the `` normal '' supernov  blue magnitudes .",
    "each model converged with ` phoenix `  not only provides a spectrum , but also the knowledge of the physical structure and line optical depth in the supernova .",
    "this gives us the ability to compute `` single ion spectra '' as follows : using the converged output of the ` phoenix`simulation , we artificially turn off all but the continuum and one single ion line opacities .",
    "the `` continuum opacities '' denote all the bound - free and free - free opacities as well as electron and rayleigh scattering .",
    "we then recalculate the solution of the scattering problem in order to get the `` single ion spectrum '' , with the level populations and free electron number kept fixed .",
    "the relative strength of the absorption and emission features in this spectrum give an indication of the contribution of each line to the complete spectrum .",
    "since the solution of the scattering problem is recalculated , the features are _ not _ expected to look exactly the same as in the complete spectrum . in any case , due to the global nature of the transfer equation , the full spectrum in _ not _ the linear combination of all the single ion spectra .    in these single ion spectra ,",
    "the flux transfer from the blue to the red due to scattering will be smaller , due to the opacity decrease caused by the suppression of most of the ions",
    ". they will thus appear bluer than the complete spectrum .",
    "the back scattering will also be decreased for the same reason , resulting in `` single ion spectra '' brighter than the full synthetic spectrum .",
    "the ratio of scattering to absorption is larger in the single ion spectra compared to the full synthetic spectrum because the full scattering problem is solved with fixed level populations and fewer atomic lines .",
    "the same effect enhances stimulated emission in the single ion spectra , resulting in strong net emission in the p - cygni profiles .",
    "since the single ion spectra are always brighter than the full synthetic spectrum we must normalize the luminosity in order to compare the two spectra .",
    "we do this by setting the single ion bolometric luminosity to that of the full synthetic spectrum .",
    "this procedure is trivial since the synthetic spectra include fluxes at all wavelengths .",
    "the special case we name `` continuum - only spectrum '' is that where all line opacities are set to zero , and therefore the spectrum is due to pure continuum processes . in a moving atmosphere a photoionization edge can produce a feature that looks like a p - cygni line @xcite .",
    "we can turn on and off different species individually , thus we can , for example , have a `` two - ion '' spectrum that consists of , for example , only si  ii and s  ii .",
    "because of their similar redshift with respect to  @xmath2  and  @xmath1  lines it is tempting to consider the @xmath10  and @xmath11    troughs to be part of their p - cygni profiles .",
    "these two lines share the 4p level , the @xmath2  line is the 4s-4p transition and the @xmath1  is the 4p-5s transition .",
    "their optical depths can thus be estimated in the sobolev approximation using @xcite : @xmath12,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the number densities of the lower and upper level associated with the transition , @xmath15 is its oscillator strength , @xmath16 is the time since explosion , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the statistical weights of the levels , and @xmath19 is the wavelength of the transition . assuming thermal equilibrium , the ratio of the  @xmath2  line optical depth ( @xmath20 ) over the  @xmath1  line optical depth ( @xmath21 ) becomes : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the energy difference between the upper and lower levels of the transition .",

    "there are at least two options for the correlation of @xmath8  with absolute blue magnitude : the silicon and sulfur lines form in the same physical region and their strength is simply determined by the local conditions , or more likely @xmath8  does not measure the region where silicon and sulfur lines form , but rather the conditions where the iron `` pseudo - continuum '' forms .    keeping in mind that one should be careful when interpreting single ion spectra , fig .",
    "[ fig : rsisfesi ] supports this latter explanation .",
    "[ fig : rsisfesi ] ( top panel ) shows that the  and blend varies little in the 6100    wavelength zone used to compute @xmath8 .",
    "the consistency in the +  two - ion spectra shape displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsisfesi ] ( bottom panel ) suggests a small variation of the relative strength of the  and features .",
    "we therefore favor the hypothesis that @xmath8  traces the evolution in shape of the `` pseudo - continuum '' dominated by iron lines . as such ,",
    "it should be better correlated with luminosity , since it probes the deeper layers of the supernova . on the other hand",
    ", it will be more sensitive to pollution by lines forming further out , especially strong  lines .      up to now",
    "we have used the w7  model as a reasonable physical explosion model of sne  ia , but we did not try to match with observed spectra .",
    "we used the knowledge of the abundance structures and the physical structure obtained by ` phoenix `  to probe the line formation process , considering the w7  model as a theoretical supernova of which we had complete knowledge .",
    "the @xmath8  ratio correlates well with absolute blue magnitude @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsisphx ] we display @xmath0   and @xmath8  for our day 20 and day 25 models as well as real sne  ia  data .",
    "the calculated @xmath0  appears to reproduce the observed data quite well for both days 20 and 25 .",
    "it follows the `` normals '' quite well and may even extend to the regime of very low luminosity sne  ia such as sn 1991bg . at first glance",
    ", it would appear that the calculated @xmath8  fails to match the observations ; however , if one restricts one s attention to the `` normals '' , [ fig .",
    "[ fig : rsisphx ] ( bottom panel ) ] , in fact the agreement between @xmath8  ( for day 25 ) and the data is better than that for @xmath0 .",
    "the change in slope we observe around @xmath40 for day 25 comes from the strong  5170    feature that dominates over  at lower luminosities .",
    "it should be noted that the w7 model is not expected to reproduce sne  ia light curves , and certainly can not be expected to match the observed diversity from fast to slow decliners .",
    "therefore , the time since explosion should be considered only as indicative , and related only with great care to real supernov  epochs .",
    "vs @xmath41 ( top panel ) and @xmath8  vs @xmath41 ( bottom panel ) the real data are displayed for reference , and are discussed thoroughly in @xcite .",
    "the trends of real and synthetic spectra for 20 and 25 days after maximum are similar .",
    "the change in slope between day 20 and day 25 days after explosion is due to  lines starting to dominate the @xmath0  wavelength region.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=70.0%][fig : rsisphx_a ] + [ fig : rsisphx_b ]",
    "we used a grid of lte ` phoenix `  synthetic spectra using the w7model , to study the spectral formation in sne  ia  around the time of maximum light . instead of focusing on fitting synthetic to observed spectra , we probed the detailed line formation in the synthetic spectrum to try to understand which ion was responsible for which feature , while taking detailed line blending into account .",
    "we analyzed the synthetic spectra in detail to study the line formation in the @xmath0  wavelength region , showing that the @xmath2  peak and the 6100    trough were dominated by  lines forming over a blend of /  lines .",
    "the intermediate 5800    peak has been shown to be a complex blend of @xmath2 ,  @xmath1 , , and  weak lines .",
    "the contribution to the 5500    trough has been ruled out .",
    "we showed that the redder edge was dominated by the @xmath1   line whereas the bluer one was dominated by  5455    line or  5170    depending on luminosity .",
    "based on our unraveling of the line formation in this wavelength region , we are able to illustrate our motivation for the definition of @xmath8 , isolating the  and  contributions of the @xmath0  region .    we described a multi - layer model where the observed pseudo - continuum is formed throughout the entire supernova and thus strong features from multiple ionization stages can occur in the observed spectrum .",
    "we stress the importance of the numerous weak iron lines and show that their blends dominate the flux transfer . as a corollary , in the multi - layer model , the inner spectrum is not close to a planck function but contains much more structure background .",
    "we showed that the ionization stage of the iron core dominates the sn  ia  colors , explaining the brighter - bluer relation at maximum light .",
    "even though a detailed study of time evolution is beyond the scope of this paper , we showed that our results where also qualitatively consistent in this regard , our earlier spectra being systematically much bluer than our later ones .",
