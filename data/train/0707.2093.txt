    "the small handful of unusual objects known as anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are characterized by their slow spin periods ( 512  s ) , large inferred magnetic fields ( @xmath110@xmath11  g ) , and persistent x - ray luminosities in great excess of available spin - down power . these young , isolated pulsars have properties common to another class of objects , the soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) . for recent reviews , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "potentially the most intriguing and most revealing property shared by axps and sgrs is their highly volatile nature : both are known to exhibit occasional and sudden dramatic flux and spin variability in the form of x - ray bursts , flares , and glitches .",
    "the magnetar model @xcite was instrumental in explaining both the `` anomalous '' x - ray emission , as well the episodes of burst activity .",
    "it identified the sources as highly magnetized isolated neutron stars , with field strengths on the order of @xmath12  g. the magnetar model uniquely , and correctly , predicted that sgr - like bursts would be observed from axps .",
    "a major proposed effect of this enormous magnetization is the `` twisting '' of the magnetosphere , with associated magnetospheric currents and heating of the crust at the twisted field - line footpoints @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to the unusual x - ray spectrum , which has generally been empirically well characterized by a two - component model consisting of a power law plus blackbody .",
    "bursts of high - energy emission occur presumably when the crust succumbs to magnetic stresses and deforms , leading to a rapid rearrangement of the external magnetic field .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed the existence of a plasma corona contained within the closed magnetosphere to explain the broad band spectrum of magnetars that extends from the infrared ( ir ) to hard x - rays beyond 100  kev @xcite .",
    "1e  1048.1@xmath05937  has had an unusual history , even by axp standards .",
    "prior to 2002 , monitoring of the pulsed flux with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) showed that its spin down was so unstable that phase coherence could be maintained for periods of only months at a time @xcite , behaviour which echoed earlier reports of @xmath13 , flux and spectral variability @xcite .",
    "two small bursts , the first ever found in an axp , were discovered in 2001 from 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  @xcite , clinching the suspected association between axps and sgrs . since 2002 , tri - weekly _ rxte _ observations of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  allowed the changing pulsed flux and spin - down rate to be monitored on relatively short timescales .",
    "* hereafter gk04 ) reported order - of - magnitude torque variability on timescales of weeks to months that only marginally correlated with large luminosity variations . the unusually slow and long - lived pulsed flux `` flares '' ( not to be confused with the sgr giant flares ; see @xcite ) that began in late 2001 and lasted into 2004 are in some ways unlike activity seen in any other axp or sgr thus far .",
    "the 2@xmath010  kev spectrum and pulsed fraction are also variable on long timescales , the latter being anti - correlated with luminosity @xcite . at near - infrared ( near - ir ) wavelengths , the flux varied dramatically during 2002@xmath02003 @xcite ; unfortunately , the sparsity of near - ir observations prohibits measurements of the variability timescale , although a near - ir / x - ray anti - correlation has been suggested @xcite .",
    "further activity in the form of another burst and small pulsed - flux increase was seen in 2004 @xcite .    here , we report on a series of simultaneous _ cxo _  and _ hst_observations obtained during the course of 2006 , as well as on archival _ cxo _ , _ xmm _  and _ vlt _  observations , in   [ sec : observations ] .",
    "we also present _ rxte _  timing results from the past three years . in 2007 march ,",
    "1e  1048.1@xmath05937  unexpectedly entered yet another new phase of activity , and we report on target - of - opportunity observations with _ cxo _  and _ swift _  taken after the 2007 march event . in   [ sec : quiescent discussion ] we discuss the 2004 - 2006 period of radiative and spin quiescence in the context of both magentar and accretion models , and in   [ sec : flare discussion ] , we describe and interpret the events following the 2007 march flare .",
    "as part of a long - term project , we regularly monitor axps using the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) . 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  is by far the most frequently observed axp due to its relatively poor rotational stability .",

    "cxo _  and two _ swift gamma - ray burst explorer _ ( _ swift _ ;",
    "[ sec : swift ] ) target - of - opportunity ( too ) observations to follow the x - ray flux and spectrum of the source . in order to characterize the long - term evolution of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  we also incorporate and reanalyze archival _ xmm - newton _ and _ cxo_observations ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we have observed 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  regularly since 1997 with _ rxte_(@xcite ; ) .",
    "our data were obtained using the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board _ rxte _  which consists of five identical and independent xenon / methane proportional counter units ( pcus ) .",
    "we use our _ rxte _  observations of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  to look for the presence of bursts ( see @xcite for details ) , to look for pulse profile changes , to monitor its pulsed flux , and to monitor its frequency evolution using phase - coherent timing when possible .    for the timing analysis , we created barycentered lightcurves in the 2@xmath05.5  kev band with 31.25  ms time resolution .",
    "as past monitoring has shown that it can be difficult to maintain pulse phase coherence over timescales longer than a few weeks , observations of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  since 2002 are done three times per week , with the three observations carefully spaced so as to allow a phase - coherent analysis and a precise frequency measurement .",
    "thus , for each observation , we fold at the pulse period determined via periodogram , cross - correlate the folded profiles with a high signal - to - noise template , and fit the resulting phases with a linear function whose slope provides the average frequency . frequencies determined in this way are shown in figure  [ fig : timing ] . as can be seen in this figure , the 2004 - 2006 frequencies were actually much more stable than in the past ; we therefore attempted a fully phase - coherent analysis as well",
    ". this will be described elsewhere ( dib et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "frequency derivatives , which are also displayed in figure  [ fig : timing ] and are from and dib et al . , ( in preparation ) , are clearly much more stable in the 2004 - 2006 interval than previously .",
    "this period of rotational stability was accompanied by x - ray pulsed flux stability and relative quiescence : the pulsed flux time series of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  in the 2@xmath010  kev band is presented in figure  [ fig : timing ] .",
    "the pulsed flux was calculated using a method similar to that described in @xcite and is based on the rms of the folded profile , but without variance subtraction .",
    "the long period of rotational stability ended in 2007 march , when a large glitch was observed @xcite .",
    "the glitch also signaled the end of the period of pulsed flux quiescence .",
    "the pulsed flux suddenly increased by a factor of @xmath13 in the energy range 2@xmath010  kev .",
    "the upper limit on the rise time of the pulsed flux for this event is approximately one week .",

    "this mode generates a 1@xmath31024 pixel image , which is read out every 2.8  ms ; pile - up in this mode is not an issue .",
    "the subsequent analysis was based on the `` level 2 '' events files for which the event times are photon arrival times ( as opposed to readout times for the `` level 1 '' events ) . following the standard threads we then corrected the `` level 2 '' events for certain caveats related to acis cc - mode data .",
    "we extracted a rectangular region centered on the source with a width typically of @xmath130 pixels .",

    "the most promising behaviors are those which show clear correlations with others , or those that are common to many or all axps and sgrs . in this section , we discuss the behavior of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , and focus on the phenomena that are potentially the most useful for testing the magnetar or other competing models .",
    "we first consider the quiescent phase we have observed in 2004 - 2006 , and its implications for axp models , then subsequently discuss the source s return to activity in 2007 march .",
    "the x - ray flaring observed pre-2004 contrasts strongly with the stable pulsed fluxes we observed in 2004 - 2006 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : timing]_c _ ) .",
    "clearly the source s stable state is also its faintest .",
    "the x - ray spectrum during this quiescent phase is also fairly constant , with @xmath79 evolving post - flare , on a time scale of several years .",
    "interestingly , @xmath79 does not return to its pre - flare value as measured in 2000 december ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : xrayspec]_a _ ) .",
    "similarly , the photon index ( fig .  [ fig : xrayspec]_b _ ) decreased in 2004 - 2006 , away from its softer pre - flare value . meanwhile the pulsed fraction ( figs .",
    "[ fig : timing]_e _ and [ fig : xrayspec]_e _ ) was slowly rising in 2004 - 2006 , as the source grew fainter , as if , unlike @xmath79 and @xmath80 , it was slowly recovering to the pre - flare value .",
    "thus , overall , the quiescent period is characterized by slow evolution , on timescales of years , in which the source flux and pulsed fraction slowly relaxed back to their pre - flare values , while the source spectrum varied significantly ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xrayspec]_c _ ) and did not relax back to its pre - flare state .",
    "this is suggestive of a fixed energy loss rate in quiescence , though perhaps with a different magnetospheric current configuration , which impacts the surface emission via return currents @xcite .",
    "we note , on the other hand , that the 2006 and pre-2001 pulse profile were very similar if not identical @xcite , and that the @xcite simple prediction for the decay time of the sort of magnetospheric twist required for 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  is an order of magnitude too large for standard parameters . the evolution could also be purely due to the thermal component @xcite .",
    "simultaneous with the slow evolution of the x - ray flux , pulsed fraction , and spectrum , the pulsar s rotational behavior clearly stabilized , with the source spinning down relatively smoothly at a value close to the long - term average in 2004 - 2006 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : timing]_a _ ) . whereas previously this axp distinguished itself from others by defying attempts at phase - coherent timing and exhibiting large torque variations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : timing]_b _ ) , in 2004 - 2006 , 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  resembled , from a timing point of view , other axps which are relatively stable rotators , at least when not glitching ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this behavior demonstrates a clear relationship between timing and radiative properties , and that the `` noise '' seen in the frequency derivative during 2001 - 2004 is likely physically different from the `` timing noise '' observed ubiquitously in radio pulsars and in otherwise radiatively stable axps .    in the context of the magnetar model ,",
    "magnetospheric activity can account for both torque and x - ray flux variability , although the former is most sensitive to currents anchored closest to the magnetic poles , so that only a broad correlation between flux and torque is expected @xcite and indeed is seen when considering many axps and sgrs @xcite . that the torque and luminosity in 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  do not vary simultaneously or in a clearly correlated way",
    "is thus not necessarily problematic if the magnetospheric current configuration is changing , although it does demonstrate that the magnetar model in this particular regard is not strongly predictive .",
    "although the magnetar model is favored , it has also been suggested that accretion from a fossil debris disk could explain axp spin characteristics @xcite as well as all aspects of the broad band emission @xcite .",
    "while it is now evident that accretion alone can not be responsible for all observed properties , most notably the energetic x - ray bursts , a `` hybrid '' model has been invoked that puts a thin debris disk around a highly magnetized pulsar @xcite . in this hybrid case , both the persistent luminosity and pulsar spin down are related to the mass transfer rate , @xmath81 . according to , who compare 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 s torque changes with changes in _ rxte _  pulsed flux , the scale of their variability does not obey an expected relationship for an accreting pulsar undergoing spin - down , thus presenting a challenge to models of fossil disk accretion .",
    "it could be argued , however , that since only the pulsed flux @xmath82 was being monitored , the total x - ray luminosity @xmath83 is still an unknown quantity .",
    "we address this by using the quantitative correlation we establish between pulsed fraction @xmath84 and total unabsorbed flux @xmath85 ( discussed in   [ sec : pfvsf disc ] and shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : pulsefrac ] ) to simulate a well sampled set of phase - averaged flux data as a function of _ rxte _  pulsed flux @xmath82 , given that @xmath84 is simply @xmath86 .",
    "the resulting `` new '' total flux , @xmath85 , is shown in figure  [ fig : timing]_d _ , along with @xmath87 in figure  [ fig : timing]_b _ for comparison . at its most variable in 2002 - 2004 , the absolute value of @xmath87 changed by a factor of @xmath210 in less than a year , while the maximal change in total unabsorbed flux is a factor of @xmath16 from peak to quiescence .",
    "note that these variations are not simultaneous . for a pulsar experiencing a spin - down torque due to mass accretion while in a quasi - equilibrium `` tracking '' phase ( i.e. the axp phase )",
    ", a strong correlation described by @xmath88 can be derived from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation 3 ) , where the magnitudes of torque and @xmath87 are proportional , the radius of the magnetosphere is defined by the alfn radius which is also a function of @xmath81 , and @xmath89 .",
    "thus , a factor of @xmath210 change in @xmath87 should be reflected by a factor of @xmath2200 simultaneous change in @xmath83 , and thus @xmath85 , if this model is correct .",
    "clearly this is not observed , rendering this particular accretion scenario unlikely .",
    "this point is further emphasized by the significant time offset between the changes in torque and flux .",
    "overall , the fact that 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 s long history of highly irregular spin - down is mirrored by trends in its x - ray emission only in a broad , rather than strict , sense strongly suggests that active accretion is not happening in this case .      our original purpose for making simultaneous _ cxo_/_hst _",
    "observations was to compare low - level near - ir and x - ray flux and spectral changes , with each observed with the same instrument , in order to look for correlations . given that the near - ir source had faded considerably in the _ hst _",
    "observations , rendering it only marginally detected in 2006 , this was not possible .",
    "compared to the handful of near - ir detections made throughout 2002 - 2003 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nearir ] ) it is clear that 2005 - 2006 marked a period of near - ir quiescence in 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 . at the time of the 2005 _ vlt _  observations in which the axp was faintly seen in @xmath14-band , its flux was consistent with the last detection in mid-2003 . with _ hst _  in 2006 we find that its @xmath44 and @xmath43 magnitudes have dropped lower than ever before observed .",
    "there is marginal evidence for near - ir flux variability during quiescence on comparably short timescales to the variability in x - ray spectral parameters , although closely spaced near - ir monitoring observations are required to confirm this .    that the near - ir faded roughly in concert with the x - ray flux",
    "is notable , suggesting a correlation similar to that seen in axp 1e  2259@xmath78586  @xcite .",
    "this is discussed further below .",
    "however such a correlation can be argued to be expected in both the magnetar and disk models . in the magnetar model",
    "it would imply that the near - ir emission is magnetospheric and hence varies , as do the x - rays , when the magnetospheric configuration varies @xcite . in the disk model ,",
    "a correlation between near - ir emission and x - ray flux is naturally expected since the putative disk is heated via x - ray illumination @xcite , however why the torque should have varied strongly and non - simultaneously is a puzzle ( see above ) .    in any case , the concurrence of the near - ir and x - ray quiescence and the timing stability is unlikely to be an accident .",
    "similarly , the presence of the two flares and the subsequent strong torque changes are also not likely to be by chance .",
    "1e  1048.1@xmath05937  reactivated in 2007 march , when a sudden pulsed flux increase was observed ( fig .",

    ", in preparation ) . our follow - up x - ray observations with _ cxo_and",
    "swift _  show that the spectral parameters , pulse shape , total flux , and pulsed fraction are drastically changed since this flare occurred ( figs .",
    "[ fig : xrayspec ] and [ fig : profiles ] ) .",
    "in particular , the total x - ray flux was @xmath27 times greater in the 2@xmath010  kev band compared with quiescence , while the pulsed fraction decreased from @xmath175% to @xmath120% .",
    "compared to the previous long - term flares from 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , the onset of this event took place more quickly by a factor of @xmath24 , the peak pulsed flux is @xmath110% greater , and the `` high '' state appears to be lasting longer .",
    "optical and near - ir follow - up with the _ magellan telescope _ and _",
    "vlt_@xcite reveal an increase in both @xmath90 and @xmath14-band of @xmath11.3 mag .",
    "very recently , @xcite reported on _ xmm _  too observations , and revealed that nearly three months after the flare onset , the total x - ray flux has decreased slightly but is still @xmath15 times brighter than in quiescence .",
    "previously , an anti - correlation between near - ir and x - ray flux in this axp was suggested , based on the correspondence of the highest near - ir detection with a low point in x - ray pulsed flux flux on the wrong date ; we have corrected this in our figure  [ fig : nearir]_c_. ] @xcite . given the new measurements from both before and after the recent event , such an anti - correlation is highly questionable .",
    "the significant rise in near - ir flux now appears correlated with the most recent x - ray flare .",
    "interestingly , in 2002 , a high near - ir detection was _ between _ the two x - ray flares ; this suggests that the near - ir emission is not exactly correlated with the x - rays , but rather an enhancement can precede , follow , or last longer than an x - ray enhancement .",
    "a near - ir brightening preceding an x - ray enhancement would rule out illuminated disk models for this source ; frequent mid- or near - ir observations are required to check this . as discussed above ,",
    "axp 1e  2259@xmath78586  also demonstrated strongly correlated near - ir and x - ray flux decay following its large 2002 outburst @xcite , but in contrast , 4u  0142 + 61 was highly variable in the near - ir despite x - ray stability @xcite , and has shown no evidence of near - ir changes coinciding with x - ray bursts ( gonzalez et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "note that the claim of correlated flux decay in the case of xte  j1810@xmath0197 @xcite is under dispute @xcite .",
    "such inconsistent behaviour is puzzling for both the magnetar and disk models .",
    "one conclusion to be drawn from figures  [ fig : timing]_d _ and [ fig : timing]_e _ is that 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 s",
    "pulsed fraction @xmath84 is strongly anti - correlated with the total x - ray flux @xmath85 , a trend already noticed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "now , with our larger sample of data covering a wider dynamic range , we can quantify this correlation : we find a power - law dependence of @xmath91 where @xmath92 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pulsefrac ] ) , with @xmath85 in the 2@xmath010  kev range . in fitting , we set the index as a free parameter , ie . not tied to any model ; therefore , some scatter is expected , as evident in the large @xmath93 produced by the fit ( @xmath94 dof ) . however , in finding the uncertainty on @xmath95 , we have scaled the @xmath84 data uncertainties to force @xmath96 , effectively scaling up @xmath97 as well .",
    "a similar correlation has been proposed in another axp , 1rxs j170849.0@xmath0400910 @xcite , although in that case it is such that the pulsed flux remains nearly constant in the presence of @xmath250% total flux changes @xcite .",
    "how could an increase in phase - averaged flux be met with a simultaneous decrease in pulsed fraction ?",
    "a growing hot spot on the neutron - star surface , a result of either a changing magnitude or configuration of returning magnetospheric currents or internal processes , could at least in principle produce such an effect , if the initial hot spot size were large enough that its size as viewed from a distant observer were a significant fraction of the stellar surface .",
    "we note that @xcite suggest that magnetar afterglows may be dominated by surface thermal , rather than magnetospheric , changes ; detailed simulations of axp pulsations using gravitational light bending and appropriate radiation beaming functions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in addition to magnetospheric scattering @xcite are needed to see if the observed correlation can be reproduced .",
    "a prediction made by the twisted magnetosphere model of @xcite is that enhanced emission should also be spectrally harder , since both are associated with larger magnetospheric twist angles .",
    "indeed , we observed a correlation between the total x - ray flux and spectral hardness : see figure  [ fig : pulsefrac ] .",
    "similar behaviour has also been reported in 1rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 @xcite .",
    "this can be interpreted as a confirmation of an important magnetar model prediction , namely that both the spectral hardness and the total flux should increase for an increasing magnetospheric twist angle @xcite .",
    "hardening of the spectrum might also be an expected effect of increased luminosity if a large injection of thermal seed photons is repeatedly up - scattered due to resonant cyclotron scattering feedback processes in the magnetosphere , thereby shifting the photon energies higher .",
    "recently @xcite have suggested that the hardness - intensity correlation in magnetars is a result of purely surface thermal changes , with no change in the magnetospheric configuration .",
    "it would be interesting to apply their model to the 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  data as they span a much greater dynamic range in flux than did the sources studied by @xcite .",
    "this is beyond the scope of our paper , however .      as seen in the _ cxo",
    "_  data obtained after 2007 march , the pulse profile of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  changed abruptly after the x - ray flux enhancement and glitch .",
    "several new harmonics are clearly visible , and are present in a largely energy - independent way ( fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] ) .",
    "this extra power in the higher harmonics clearly signals a complication of the surface and/or magnetospheric configuration .",
    "this change contrasts with that seen after the 2002 outburst of 1e  2259@xmath78586 , which involved mainly an exchange of powers between the fundamental and first harmonic , with higher harmonics remaining relatively unchanged @xcite . also , the change contrasts with that seen during the 1998 sgr  1900 + 14 giant flare , in which the sgr pulse profile simplified greatly immediately post - flare @xcite .",
    "however , the opposite occured followed the 2004 giant flare from sgr  1806@xmath020 @xcite , when a sinusoidal - to - complex evolution in pulse morphology took place , similar to that of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 .",
    "this diversity of behaviors in magnetars post - outburst is problematic for understanding the underlying physics ; indeed it indicates a wide variety of phenomenon phase space , which itself must be explained by models . the peculiar suppression of the 4th harmonic in the post - glitch 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  profile is particularly puzzling to us ;",
    "perhaps it indicates an important and unchangeable symmetry in the combined emission and viewing geometries , or perhaps it is a chance occurence and will not occur again in future events .      in the _ cxo _  observation made on 2007 april 6 , the one closest to and just after the 2007 march event , the x - ray spectrum of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  could not be well fit by a simple continuum model , in contrast with the other datasets .",
    "we identified a possible absorption line near 2.7  kev , though we note that the spectral model including this line is still not a good fit to the data .",
    "this suggests that other low - level features may be present as well , including a possible feature at roughly half the above line s energy , @xmath11.3  kev .",
    "the putative 2.7  kev line joins the growing list of puzzling and sometimes statistically marginal axp / sgr spectral features @xcite .",
    "examples of some feature detections that are clearly statistically significant are , interestingly , repeatedly near @xmath113  kev , e.g. in 1e  1048.1@xmath05937@xcite , in xte  j1810@xmath0197 @xcite , and very recently axp 4u  0142 + 61 ( * ? ? ? * and gavriil et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the feature we see in the 2007 april data for 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  are unlike any of these .",
    "it is perhaps more reminiscent of the absorption features seen in some `` isolated neutron stars '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and , if similarly interpreted as an electron cyclotron line , implies a magnetic field of @xmath98  g , or @xmath99  g for a proton cyclotron line .",
    "the latter value is of course more in line with the field expected near the surface of a magnetar .",
    "however , the feature could also be an atomic transition ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; it is difficult to know given the present data .",
    "regardless , the spectrum 10  days later , on 2007 april 16 , showed no such features , indicating that whatever their origin , it had subsided , and on a shorter timescale than that of any profile or flux relaxation .",
    "the 2001 - 2002 flares observed in 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  are unique in that they had very well resolved rise times of many weeks . the 2007 april event , by contrast , involved an x - ray pulsed flux enhancement that rose at least 4 times faster . in this sense",
    "it is perhaps more similar to the 2002 outburst of 1e  2259@xmath78586@xcite , although in that case a brief rise could have been missed by the sparse monitoring . during that outburst ,",
    "1e  2259@xmath78586   exhibited an order - of - magnitude increase in pulsed and phase - averaged flux , as well as numerous other changes including ( but not limited to ) @xmath180 sgr - like bursts . similarly to 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , both the total and pulsed flux increased during the 1e  2259@xmath78586  outburst , and the pulsed fraction decreased , going from 23% in quiescence down to 15% @xcite .",
    "however , the pulsed fraction was not as tightly correlated to the pulsed flux : the pulsed fraction recovered within @xmath13 days @xcite , whereas the flux took several months to return to its pre - outburst value @xcite . in terms of energetics ,",
    "the total energy in 2@xmath010  kev released in the 1e  2259@xmath78586  outburst was @xmath100  erg and @xmath101  erg during the rapid and gradual decay components , respectively ( see table  5 of * ? ? ? * ) . for 1e  1048.1@xmath05937",
    ", we estimate that up to 2007 april 28 , the date of the last _ cxo _  observation , the total energy emitted is comparable , roughly @xmath102  erg ( 2@xmath010  kev ) , based on the pulsed fraction - total flux correlation and assuming a distance of 2.7  kpc @xcite , or @xmath103  erg assuming 9.0  kpc @xcite .",
    "near - ir flux variability , possibly ( in the case of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 ) and likely ( in 1e  2259@xmath78586 ) correlated to x - ray flux , was observed following both events . that the 2007 1e  1048.1@xmath05937event clearly involved a large rotational glitch ,",
    "as did the 2002 1e  2259@xmath78586  event , is also a commonality , although glitches at the time of the 2001 - 2002 flares could easily have been missed because of the large amount of timing noise and our inability to phase connect the data at that time ( dib et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "sgr - like bursts from 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  have not been observed thus far in 2007 , but that does not preclude their existence given that our observing duty cycle is so low . similar to 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , 1e  2259@xmath78586  exhibited a pulse profile change , albeit one involving only the fundamental and first harmonic , in constrast to the appearance of higher harmonic structure in 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 . finally , as in 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , spectral hardening was observed during the 1e  2259@xmath78586  flare .",
    "thus overall , the 2007 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  event has practically all properties consistent with the 2002 1e  2259@xmath78586  event , but differs from its earlier flares primarily by rise time .",
    "the transient axp xte  j1810@xmath0197 presents another interesting example for comparison .",
    "this axp , which `` turned - on '' in late 2002 or early 2003 @xcite , has been steadily declining in x - ray flux since , reaching apparent quiescence in 2005 - 2006 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , very little is known about the onset of enhanced emission , ie .",
    ", whether it was accompanied by a glitch / burst , or what the timescale of the rise was . while the exponential decay timescale of several years does resemble that of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 s 2001 - 2002 post - flare behavior , how the most recent flare will fade is as yet undetermined .",
    "furthermore , the peak and quiescent fluxes of xte  j1810@xmath0197 differed by a much greater amount , nearly 2 orders of magnitude @xcite , while the recent total 2@xmath010  kev flux increase in 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  was by a factor of @xmath17 .",
    "spectrally , xte  j1810@xmath0197 was harder in outburst and softer in quiescence , similar to 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , when modelled as 2-temperature blackbody @xcite or as a blackbody plus power law ( w. zhu , private communication )",
    ". one major distinction , however , is the clear evidence for a positive correlation between pulsed fraction and total flux in xte  j1810@xmath0197 @xcite .",
    "while it may be tempting to link the transience of xte  j1810@xmath0197 to 1e  1048.1@xmath05937-like post - flaring behaviour , the dissimilarities are important and remind us that we may be comparing mere coincidences .    compared to the sgr giant flares , rare events in which an enormous amount of broad band energy ( @xmath104  erg ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is output , the 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  event is orders of magnitude less energetic .",
    "giant flares release most of their energy in a short ( @xmath311  s ) , initial @xmath105-ray spike , a property not observed in this event , although a small initial burst could have been missed .",
    "furthermore , the 2007 event is prolonged , and while giant flares do gradually decay , the amount of energy in the tail is usually small compared to that of the spike @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the gradual evolution of the persistent properties seen before and after the 2004 december giant flare of sgr  1806@xmath020 do show some resemblance to 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 s behaviour . during this pre - flare period of enhanced burst activity in sgr  1806@xmath020 that began in mid-2003 ,",
    "the pulsar torque , pulsed flux , total flux , and hardness increased on a @xmath1year timescale , peaking several months before the giant flare occurred in 2004 december , and continuing to decline well after the flare epoch @xcite .",
    "the gradual changes , particularly the well - resolved factor of @xmath22 increase in total unabsorbed flux , perhaps resemble the 2001 - 2002 events of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  more than the 2007 event . as with 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , a correlation was found between spectral hardness and intensity in sgr  1806@xmath020 , and there appeared to be some sort of physical connection between frequency derivative ( or torque ) evolution and variability in the spectrum and pulsed flux @xcite .",
    "however , in sgr  1806@xmath020 , there was no evidence for a correlation between the phase - averaged flux , which likely peaked around 2004 october , and pulsed fraction , which was stable in the flux - enhanced pre - flare period but was lower than average in early 2005 when the persistent flux had approached quiescent levels @xcite",
    ". furthermore , sgr  1806@xmath020 s pulse profile was noticeably more sinusoidal while brightest @xcite , although the pulse profile likely changed as a direct results of the giant flare , rather than the slow evolution of persistent flux .",
    "we have considered @xmath110  yrs of multiwavelength observations of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 .",
    "the source , in 2004 - 2006 , gradually relaxed apparently back to quiescence in most respects , only to `` awaken '' suddenly in the glitch / flare event of 2007 march . by observing 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  while quiescent , it has become apparent that previous instabilities in timing , x - ray and near - ir flux were likely all linked to the major long - term flaring events of 2001 - 2002 , whose nature is yet unknown but likely includes changes in the stellar magnetosphere s current configuration .",
    "the asynchronous spin and x - ray flux variability we have observed is incompatible with expectations of the fossil disk accretion model . following the most recent 2007 event , we observed total x - ray flux variability that is strongly correlated with x - ray pulsed fraction , x - ray spectral hardness , and changes in near - ir flux .",
    "these observations largely agree with expectations of the magnetar model . to date , the 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  2007 event is ongoing , as is continued multiwavelength monitoring .",
