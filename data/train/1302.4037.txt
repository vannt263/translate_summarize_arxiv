    "microwave - induced magnetoconductivity oscillations , whose minima evolve into novel zero - resistance states at high microwave ( mw ) power , were first observed in degenerate semiconductor two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems  @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "the magnetic field @xmath0 was directed normally to the electron layer , and the mw frequency @xmath1 was substantially larger than the cyclotron frequency @xmath2 .",
    "these observations have attracted much theoretical interest and sparked invention of a wide variety of theoretical mechanisms  @xcite intended to explain remarkable 1/b - periodic oscillations and the appearance of zero - resistance states .",
    "recently , similar 1/b - periodic magnetoconductivity oscillations were observed in a particulary simple nondegenerate multi - subband 2d electron liquid formed on the free surface of liquid @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "their minima also evolve into zero - resistance states at high mw power .",
    "still , there is an important difference between results reported for surface electrons ( ses ) in liquid helium and those obtained for semiconductor systems . in experiments",
    "@xcite , @xmath1 is quite arbitrary : @xmath4 . to observe magneto - oscillations in the electron system formed on the liquid - helium surface",
    "it is necessary that the mw frequency @xmath1 be equal to the resonance frequency @xmath5 for electron excitation to the next surface subband .",
    "the sequence @xmath6 ( here @xmath7 ) describes the energy spectrum of electron subbands formed at the free surface of liquid helium because of the interplay of the attractive image force and the potential barrier @xmath8 at the interface  @xcite . in the limit of low holding electric fields",
    "@xmath9 directed normally to the interface , @xmath10 for liquid @xmath3 and @xmath11 for liquid @xmath12 .",
    "thus , in experiments on semiconductor systems , higher electron subbands were not excited by the mw field , whereas in experiments with ses  @xcite there is a substantial fraction of electrons occupied the first excited subband because of the mw resonance .",
    "the theory explaining mw - resonance - induced magnetoconductivity oscillations observed for ses on liquid helium was worked out  @xcite using the quasi - elastic approximation for electron scattering by ripplons and vapor atoms .",
    "this approximation assumes that the energy exchange at a collision is much smaller than the collision broadening of landau levels .",
    "the origin of magneto - oscillations and negative conductivity effects induced by resonance mw excitation can be seen already from a simple analysis of the energy conservation for usual inter - subband electron scattering ( not involving photons ) in the presence of the uniform driving electric field @xmath13 .",
    "according to this analysis , for the electron spectrum@xmath14(here @xmath15 is the center coordinate of the cyclotron orbit ) , the decay of an excited subband @xmath16 ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ) results in displacements of the orbit center@xmath20proportional to the quantity @xmath21 .",
    "this quantity changes its sign at the level - matching points @xmath22 defined by the condition @xmath23 ( here @xmath24 is an integer ) . at @xmath25 @xmath22 , the displacement @xmath26 and ,",
    "therefore , the decay of the excited subband is accompanied by electron scattering against the driving force .",
    "somehow , eq .  ( [ e2 ] ) resembles the displacement mechanism of the negative conductivity effect discussed broadly for semiconductor systems  @xcite where in a similar equation the photon quantum @xmath27 stands instead of @xmath28 . in that theory",
    ", the sign - changing correction to @xmath29 is due to radiation - induced disorder - assisted current , and the photon energy enters the energy conservation law .",
    "the important point is that here photons are not involved in inter - subband scattering directly and the condition @xmath26 found for decay processes is not sufficient for obtaining negative corrections to the momentum relaxation rate . naturally , a reverse electron scattering from the ground subband to the excited subband results in @xmath30 , and the negative conductivity effect is fully compensated if the electron system is in equilibrium , and fractional occupancies of surface subbands obey the condition @xmath31 ( here @xmath32 is the electron temperature ) .",
    "the important role of the resonant mw field is to provide an extra filling of the excited subband to break the balance of inter - subband scattering mentioned above .",
    "for example , the decay of the first excited subband ( @xmath33 ) to the ground subband ( @xmath34 ) caused by quasi - elastic scattering is possible only if @xmath35 is close to the level - matching points @xmath22 , because @xmath36 is restricted by the magnetic length . if @xmath35 is substantially away from these level - matching points , the quasi - elastic decay is impossible and @xmath37 because of mw excitation",
    "under a weak driving field , the width of regions of the magnetic field near @xmath22 , where the excited subband decays quasi - elastically , is determined by the collision broadening of the corresponding landau levels . within these regions ,",
    "the momentum relaxation rate of ses caused by inter - subband scattering  @xcite@xmath38therefore , the condition @xmath39 is crucial for the appearance of negative corrections to the momentum relaxation rate @xmath40 and to magnetoconductivity @xmath29 .",
    "an increase in @xmath41 caused by trivial heating of ses obviously can not lead to the sign - changing term .",
    "the above noted analysis assumes that the ripplon energy @xmath42 can be neglected as compares to typical electron energies . in the absence of the magnetic field",
    ", this is the conventional approximation because @xmath43 for ripplons involved in scattering events . under a magnetic field",
    "applied perpendicular to the electron layer , there is an additional energy parameter which describes the width of the single - electron density of states : the collision broadening of landau levels @xmath44 . for ses on liquid helium ,",
    "landau levels are extremely narrow : @xmath45 .",
    "wave vectors of ripplons involved in electron scattering @xmath46 [ here @xmath47 is the magnetic length ] , and the energy exchange @xmath48 increases with @xmath35 faster than @xmath44 which is approximately proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , in a high magnetic field range , depending on temperature ( @xmath50 ) , @xmath42 becomes comparable with @xmath44 , and electron scattering is suppressed .",
    "experimental observation  @xcite indicates that the inelastic effect on the quantum magnetotransport becomes substantial at @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and the suppression of @xmath29 is the stronger the higher magnetic field is applied .",
    "simple estimates allow to assume that similar conditions can be realized in an experiment on magneto - oscillations in photoconductivity of ses on liquid @xmath12 , because the corresponding excitation frequency @xmath53 is high , and the level - matching points @xmath54 , if @xmath55 . in this case , the inelastic effect can cause additional variations of the shape of magnetoconductivity oscillations in the vicinity of the level - matching points @xmath22 , which could be used for experimental identification of the microscopic mechanism of zero - resistance states and the resonant photovoltaic effect discovered recently  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we report the theory of magnetoconductivity oscillations induced by resonance mw excitation which takes into account the inelastic nature of the decay of excited subbands caused by electron - ripplon interaction .",
    "we show that for inter - subband scattering the inelastic effect displays differently as compared to the equilibrium magnetotransport in a single subband . in our treatment , the maximum of the decay rate of an excited subband is naturally split near the level - matching points @xmath22 because of one - ripplon creation and destruction processes .",
    "the unusual thing is that this inelastic effect increases with @xmath24 , and therefore extends itself into the lower magnetic field range @xmath56 .",
    "we show also that the inelastic effect on the momentum relaxation rate of the electron layer caused by inter - subband scattering can not be reduced to simple splitting similar to that of the decay rate . in magnetoconductivity curves ,",
    "this effect displays itself as a combination of splitting and inversion . as a result",
    ", @xmath29 develops a new remarkable wavy feature in the vicinity of the level - matching points .",
    "the influence of both mutual electron interaction and electron heating on the new fine structure of mw - induced magneto - oscillations is also analyzed .",
    "the most interesting features of mw - induced magnetoconductivity oscillations such as zero - resistance states are observed  @xcite in the low temperature range ( @xmath57 ) where ses are predominantly scattered by capillary wave quanta ( ripplons ) .",
    "ripplons represent a sort of 2d phonons with an unusual spectrum @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the surface tension and mass density of liquid helium , correspondingly .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian of electron - ripplon interaction is similar to the hamiltonian of electron - phonon interaction in solids@xmath61where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are destruction and creation operators , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is the electron - ripplon coupling whose properties and matrix elements @xmath66 are well defined in the literature  @xcite .    to describe quantum magnetotransport of a 2d electron gas",
    "it is conventional to use the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) theory  @xcite or the linear response theory  @xcite with the proper approximation for the electron density - of - states function .",
    "unfortunately , these approaches can not be applied directly to the se system under resonance mw excitation . in these theories , conductivity is an equilibrium property of the system , whereas here we need to describe conductivity of the system which is far away from its equilibrium state . in our conductivity treatment",
    ", we intend also to include strong coulomb interaction between electrons whose average potential energy can be much higher then the average kinetic energy .",
    "for this purposes , it is necessary to use an extension of the scba theory applicable for arbitrary subband occupancies @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "firstly , we note that the well - known results of the scba theory and kubo equations for magnetoconductivity of the 2d electron gas can be reproduced in a quite direct way by simple evaluation of the momentum gained by scatterers  @xcite , if scattering probabilities of the born approximation are taken in the proper form which includes the contribution from high order terms ( self - energy effects ) .",
    "this kind of probabilities were actually given already in the kubo theory  @xcite .",
    "here we express these probabilities through a quite general correlation function of the multi - subband 2d electron system which preserves basic equilibrium properties of the in - plane motion and , at the same time , is independent of subband occupancies .",
    "consider the average probability of both intra and inter - subband scattering ( @xmath69 ) which is accompanied by the momentum exchange @xmath70 caused by ripplon destruction @xmath71 and creation @xmath72 .",
    "conventional born approximation yields@xmath73 @xmath74where @xmath75 represents landau levels , @xmath76 means averaging over initial in - plane states for the given surface subbad @xmath77 , and we have introduced @xmath78as the function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath79 . for @xmath80 , the distribution function of ripplons @xmath81 . in the following ,",
    "the surface area @xmath82 will be set to unity .",
    "it is well known that @xmath83 can be written as @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is a function of the absolute value of the 2d wave - vector . the exact expression for @xmath86",

    "according the relationship @xmath87 the quantity to be averaged in eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) does not depend on @xmath15 , and , therefore , eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) actually contains the averaging over discrete landau numbers @xmath88 only .",
    "it is natural to assume that a weak dc driving field @xmath13 does not change electron distribution over landau levels , and one can use the distribution function @xmath89 for the averaging operation .",
    "this is quite clear in the absence of scatterers , because under the magnetic field a driving electric field can be eliminated by a proper choice of the inertial reference frame : @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , if there is no a driving electric field in the laboratory frame , it appears in any other inertial reference frame . at a low drift velocity of the electron system ,",
    "quasi - elastic scattering can not change the population of landau levels .",
    "the above given statement is also verified by the comparison of the results obtained in the treatment considered here with the well - known results of the conventional scba at zero mw power .    following the procedure described in the linear response theory  @xcite , and taking into account that @xmath91 ( here @xmath92 is the absolute value of the hall velocity ) , eq .",

    "we retain the index @xmath77 keeping in mind further broadening due to interaction with scatterers because its strength is different for different surface subbands .",
    "similar equation can be found for ripplon creation processes:@xmath98at @xmath99 the function @xmath100 coincides with the dynamic structure factor ( dsf ) of a nondegenerate 2d electron gas .",
    "it should be noted that the above given equations resemble scattering cross - sections of thermal neutrons and x - rays in solids  @xcite . here",
    "scatterers ( ripplons ) play the role of particle fluxes whereas the electron layer represents a target .",
    "the self - energy effects ( high order terms ) , which are very important for 2d electron systems under a quantizing magnetic field , are taken into account by inclusion of the collision broadening @xmath101 of landau levels of a given surface subband ( @xmath77 ) according to the cumulant approach  @xcite : @xmath102 .",

    "the total collision frequency @xmath211 is shown by the solid line . for the chosen excitation rate , @xmath211 acquires negative values which leads to negative conductivity effects . the condition @xmath302 was previously shown  @xcite to be the origin of zero - resistance states .    the evolution of the shape of magnetoconductivity variations near @xmath22 is illustrated in fig",

    "therefore , the holding field should be kept much smaller than the effective field of the image potential contributing into the electron - ripplon coupling : @xmath326 at @xmath327 . at the same time , in the limit of low holding fields , there is a chance to meet the resonance condition for three surface subbands simultaneously , as noted in the previous section . in this case , the shape of magnetoconductivity oscillations will be affected by an additional filling of the third resonant subband @xmath328 , and there might be additional variations of @xmath29 at fractional values of the ratio @xmath329 caused by electron scattering from the third subband ( @xmath200 ) to the ground subband ( @xmath34 ) .",

    "the inelastic effect discussed here is shown to affect differently the decay rate of the excited subband and the electron momentum relaxation rate caused by inter - subband scattering .",
    "near the level matching points ( @xmath331 ) the decay maxima are split because of ripplon destruction and creation processes .",
    "this splitting surprisingly becomes stronger in the low magnetic field range because of the enhancement factor @xmath332 . at the same time , magnetoconductivity variations induced by the inelastic effect represent a mixture of splitting and inversion . as a result , a new wavy feature can be realized on the shape of magnetoconductivity oscillations in the vicinity of the level - matching points .",
    "the amplitude of this fine structure increases in the range of low magnetic fields , which is contrary to the inelastic effect observed for intra - subband scattering  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the influence of strong electron - electron interaction and possible heating of the electron system on the display of the inelastic effect in photoconductivity oscillations .",
    "the results obtained indicate that a substantial increase in electron density @xmath109 above @xmath333 reduces strongly new wavy variations of @xmath334 induced by the inelastic effect .",
    "similar reduction in the display of the inelastic effect is expected if the electron system is heated strongly because of the decay of excited subbands .",
    "fortunately , the negative effect of electron heating is caused by the coulomb broadening of the generalized dynamic structure factor of the multi - subband 2d electron system which can be reduced by a proper decrease in electron density .",
