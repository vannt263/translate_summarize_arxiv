    "the optically visible parts of galactic discs are usually remarkably thin and flat , whereas the more extended hi discs of many edge - on galaxies appear noticeably warped with an integral sign shape .",
    "stellar warps do exist in some galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but are much less pronounced than the warps in the extended gaseous discs .",
    "we infer that warps are a gravitational phenomenon because weak stellar warps , if present , follow the same warped plane as the gaseous ones @xcite",
    ".    warps are extremely common  at least half of all spiral galaxies are warped : @xcite found 12 out of 20 edge - on spiral galaxies are warped .",
    "the more recent hi observations by @xcite found that 20 out of 26 edge - on galaxies are warped .",
    "since these surveys detected only warps whose line of nodes is close to our line of sight , the true fraction of warps must be even higher .",
    "in fact @xcite also found that all galaxies possessing an hi disc more extended than the optical one are warped .",
    "the ubiquity of warps suggests that warps are either repeatedly regenerated or long - lived .",
    "warps can be detected kinematically even when the system is not edge - on .",
    "@xcite studied a sample of 12 warped galaxies with high - quality 21-cm data , and found that galactic warps obey some fairly simple rules :    1 .",
    "the hi layer typically is coplanar inside radius @xmath3 , the radius where the b - band surface brightness is @xmath4 . and",

    "the line of nodes ( lon ) is roughly straight inside @xmath8 ; 3 .",
    "the lon takes the form of a loosely - wound _ leading spiral _",
    "outside @xmath8 .",
    "the origin and persistence of warps still presents a puzzle .",
    "@xcite , before the discovery of dark matter halos , studied the bending dynamics of isolated thin discs .",
    "they found that discrete warp modes in a cold , razor - thin disc do not exist unless the edge is unrealistically sharp .",
    "such modes ( standing waves ) can be realized by the superposition of outgoing and ingoing waves , provided that waves incident on the edge can reflect .",
    "however , a disc with a smooth edge does not reflect bending waves @xcite .",
    "subsequent ideas of warp formation rely in some way on the interaction between the disc and its dark matter halo . @xcite and @xcite suggested that a flattened halo misaligned with the disc could form a long - lasting warp . @xcite and",
    "@xcite invoked a rigid flattened halo and obtained persisting warps ( dubbed `` modified tilt modes '' ) , which were insensitive to the details of the disc edge .",
    "@xcite studied the tilting dynamics of a set of rings also in a rigid halo , but generally assumed that the inner disc lay in the symmetry plane of the spheroidal halo .",
    "dark matter halos are not rigid , however , and a responsive halo alters the dynamics in several ways .",
    "@xcite showed that the precession of a misaligned disc inside a flattened halo would sap energy from the warp mode through dynamical friction , damping it on timescales much shorter than a hubble time .",
    "numerical studies using @xmath0-body halos also found the discrete warp mode does not survive : @xcite found that the inner halo and disc quickly settle into alignment .",
    "@xcite confirm that a discrete warp mode in a rigid halo does not survive in a simulation with a responsive halo , and conclude that the inner halo could never be significantly misaligned from the inner disc .",
    "@xcite drew attention to the likely misalignment with the disc axes of late infalling material in hierarchical galaxy formation models , and proposed that warps arise due to the slewing of the galactic potential as material with misaligned angular momentum is accreted .",
    "@xcite showed , for a realistic cosmic scenario , that the mean spin axis of a galaxy must slew as late arriving material rains down on the early disc .",
    "the less - than - critical matter density in modern @xmath9cdm universe models implies that infall is less pervasive at later times , but it manifestly continues to the present day in gravitationally bound environments such as that of the local group .",
    "* hereafter jb99 ) present results of an experiment in which a disc is subjected to the torque from a misaligned , massive torus at a large radius .",
    "this well - defined perturbation is a very crude model of an outer halo that is rotationally flattened , with a spin axis misaligned with that of the disc .",
    "it is misaligned and farther out because , in hierarchical scenarios , the mean angular momentum of the later arriving outer halo is probably misaligned from that of the original inner halo and disc .",
    "they concede that the accretion axis is in reality likely to slew continuously over time , so a model with a constant inclination is somewhat unrealistic .    here",
    "we use high quality @xmath0-body simulations of a model of this type .",
    "we improve on the work by jb99 in the following main aspects :    * we use a disc of particles with random motion , whereas jb99 employed a disc composed of rigid rings coupled only by gravitation .",
    "thus jb99 did not include random motion of the disc stars , which has been shown to add to the stiffness of the disc @xcite ; * we use a much more extensive disc so that we can study the warp ",
    "jb99 truncated the disc at @xmath10 .",
    "the behaviour of the lon beyond this radius is important for comparing our results with observations of warps (   briggs s rules ) ; * in  [ sec : warppersist ] we remove the forcing perturbation at later times and follow the evolution of the distorted disc fully self - consistently .",
    "we obtain flat inner discs and long - lasting warps in the outer disc that match all of briggs s rules quite well .",
    "we present a detailed analysis of the dynamics and show , for example , that the persistence of warps is not nearly as perplexing as is currently believed .",
    "following jb99 , our simulations include three distinct mass components : a disc , a halo , and an accreted torus .",
    "the plane of the torus is inclined to that of the disc , as sketched in figure  [ fig : initial ] .",
    "our simulations are set up as follows : the initial disc has the exponential surface density profile : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the cylindrical radius and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the scale radius and the total mass of the disc , respectively .",
    "we truncate the disc at @xmath15 , spread the particles vertically as the isothermal sheet with a locally - defined equilibrium vertical velocity dispersion , and embed it in the halo ; the rms vertical thickness of the initial disc is @xmath16 at any radius .",
    "we set the initial velocities of the disc particles such that the toomre stability parameter @xmath17 and the disc is in rotational balance .",
    "the halo is set up so as to be in equilibrium with the disc using the procedure described in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "the distribution function has a king - model form with @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the central velocity dispersion and @xmath20 is the relative potential at the centre @xcite , which in our case includes a contribution from the disc .",
    "we set the tidal radius @xmath21 , and total mass @xmath22 .",
    "the king radius is @xmath23 and the half - mass radius of the halo is @xmath24 .",
    "the inner halo is mildly oblate initially due to the gravity of the disc .",
    "the halo we adopted here is massive , as we attempt to use a similar halo profile used by jb99 in which @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "other experiments with halos having different mass profiles , to be reported elsewhere , have revealed that the conclusions presented here are not strongly affected by the choice of halo ; warping behaviour is less sensitive to the density profile or total mass of the halo than to the masses and sizes of the disc and torus .",
    "following jb99 , we gradually inject particles into an inclined torus , causing its mass to increase linearly from 0 at @xmath27 , to @xmath28 at @xmath29 .",
    "the torus , which has radius @xmath30 , is uniform in azimuth and has gaussian density profile in cross - section , with a standard deviation @xmath31 ; in our case , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the torus plane is inclined at @xmath34 relative to the initial disc plane and we adopt the line of nodes as the @xmath35-axis of our coordinate system .",
    "the initial velocities of injected torus particles are equal to the local circular speed in magnitude and directed tangentially around the torus , as in jb99 .",
    "thus the torus has very large angular momentum , and therefore does not precess significantly from its original plane in response to the torque from the disc .",
    "however , a cold torus is dynamically unstable and breaks into radially extensive spiral filaments after a few gyrs when allowed to evolve self - consistently .",
    "the breakup of the cold torus depends on many factors that we do not fully understand  e.g. , tori with the same parameters dissolve differently and at different times in runs with rigid and live halos . in order to avoid the inconvenient complication of time - varying , non - axisymmetric perturbing forces acting on the disc",
    ", we generally keep the torus particles fixed in their initial positions relative to the galactic centre .",
    "this stratagem enables us to compare the dynamical evolution of warps in different experiments with the same torus parameters .",
    "all 1.25 million particles belonging to massive components in our simulations have equal masses .",
    "we adopt @xmath13 and @xmath14 as our units of length and mass , respectively , and our time units are therefore dynamical times @xmath36 . generally all quantities are expressed in units such that @xmath37 unless otherwise noted .",
    "these units can be scaled to physical values as desired ; we adopt one possible scaling , choosing @xmath38kpc and a unit of time of @xmath39myr implies @xmath40 ; our unit of velocity scales to 244  km  s@xmath41 .",

    "these simplified experiments are very helpful for developing understanding of warp dynamics and the reason for the curved lon .",
    "we stress that our adopted massive torus at a very large radius has so much angular momentum that its precession due to the torques from the disc and flattened inner halo can be neglected .",
    "we first study a very simple model , in which the halo is both rigid and spherical .",

    "the disc is composed of many concentric rings of massless particles , which precess at fixed inclination in a retrograde fashion under the torque of the distant accreting torus .",
    "the precession is illustrated in figure  [ fig : precess ] .",
    "we use the following notation : @xmath81 is the nodal precession rate of a narrow annulus of the disc at radius @xmath12 ; @xmath73 is the angle between the symmetry axis of this annulus and the @xmath47-axis ( , the normal to the initial unperturbed disc ) ; @xmath70 is the azimuthal angle of the symmetry axis of the annulus projected in the @xmath60-@xmath35 plane , which is the plane of the initial unperturbed disc .",

    "the angles , @xmath70 and @xmath73 , measured from particles at two distinct radii are shown in figure  [ fig : anglesmatch ] ; each particle in an annulus has its own pair of angles at each instant , which vary systematically with phase giving rise to the spread .",
    "the mean is in qualitative agreement with these second - order predictions , shown by the dashed curves while the fourth order ( equation  [ eqn : omegap_total ] ) predictions ( solid curves ) agree very well . since @xmath70 can have any value when @xmath87 , we set @xmath70 to @xmath88 for @xmath89 , to suppress noise in these figures .",
    "the increasing rate of retrograde precession with radius causes the warp angle @xmath57 and @xmath58 to increase outwards also .",
    "we observe this behaviour in our test - particle simulation as shown in figure  [ fig : no_disk_tip_lon ] . in this simplified model",
    ", the warp appears as the result of the differential precession and the lon forms a trailing spiral .",
    "this simulation also serves as a nice check of parts of our numerical code : forces from the torus particles and the time integration of the test particle disc are calculated accurately .",
    "we separate a self - gravitating disc into an inner disc and an outer disc . the dense inner disc , which contains most of the disc mass , tilts rigidly as a whole ; it is strongly coupled together due both to self - gravity and to radial velocity spread of stars , which communicate stress across the disc via epicyclic excursions @xcite .",
    "the gradual locking of the disc due to self - gravity was also found in @xcite .",
    "the low - density outer disc , on the other hand , is much less cohesive because self - gravity is weak and epicycles are small ; the outer disc behaves more as a collection of test particles therefore .",
    "as the torus mass rises , the whole disc starts to precess as described in  [ sec : toymodel ] .",
    "the torque from the torus causes the inner disc , which is strongly cohesive , to precess slowly as a whole in a retrograde manner about the symmetry axis of the torus , while the outer disc precesses more rapidly .",
    "the developing misalignment between the inner and outer disc causes the particles in the outer disc to feel an additional torque from the massive inner disc .",
    "the rate of precession of the outer disc due to the torque from the inner disc follows a different rule from that due to the torus .    the disc potential at larger radii can be approximated as the sum of a monopole and a quadrupole term ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  6 - 84 ) , @xmath90 using equation  ( [ eqn : expdisk ] ) for an exponential disc , we have @xmath91 in the same manner as for the torus ( appendix  [ app : pre ] , see also * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , we find the precession rate of test rings due to the disc is @xmath92    while still producing retrograde precession , the rate from this additional forcing term varies with radius in the opposite sense of that from the torus . in the case of forcing by the inner disc , the precession rate equation  ( [ eqn : prec_rate_disk ] ) decreases with increasing radius , which in isolation would tend to make the lon develop a leading spiral .",
    "the outer disc is now subject to two torques , from the torus and from the inner disc , both of which cause retrograde precession , but at rates that vary radially in opposite senses . whether the resulting spiral in the warp lon should lead or trail over the range of interest depends on relative magnitudes of the torques , and is best determined from simulations .",
    "we have therefore performed a series of simulations with increasingly massive discs to show that the torque from the inner disc dominates in our canonical simulation , which develops a leading spiral in the lon ( see figure  [ fig : typicallon ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : tip_lon_add_disk ] presents the tip - lon diagrams from four experiments with increasingly larger disc masses ( from @xmath93 to @xmath94 ) to demonstrate the effect of the disc mass .",
    "these experiments continue to employ the same spherical rigid halo and torus parameters as above .",

    "the small differences in the angle of precession between figures  [ fig : tip_lon_749 ] and [ fig : no_disk_tip_lon](b ) indicate that the oblateness of the halo ( induced by the torus ) contributes only slightly to the precession of the disc .",

    "we have @xmath100 the negative sign indicates that the precession is retrograde . whether the spiral leads or trails depends on whether @xmath81 falls or rises as @xmath12 increases , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : lon_illus ] .",

    "[ fig : tip_lon_add_disk](c ) where @xmath109 , the spirality twist occurs near the sixth point from the centre ( , near the annulus centered on @xmath110 ) , so it agrees well with the expected @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath101 can also be understood in the context of a laplacian surface , where the net torque vanishes @xcite .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath101 is also the transition radius of the laplacian surface ; for @xmath111 , the laplacian surface almost coincides with the inner disc , which dominates the precession for small radii , while for @xmath112 , the laplacian surface follows the equatorial plane of the torus , which dominates the precession at large radii .",
    "the inner part of a responsive halo becomes oblate due to the massive inner disc .",
    "the co - aligned oblate inner halo adds significantly to the torque from the inner disc , causing @xmath101 to be larger than estimated above , to perhaps @xmath113 .",

    "we used 14 radial bins to cover all particles ; the binning scheme is similar to that described in  [ sec : leadinglon ] .",
    "the spirality twist shows up in figure  [ fig : lontwist ] near the seventh from outermost point ( , near the annulus centered on @xmath117 ) .",
    "as expected , the spirality twist grows more pronounced with time .",
    "note that a twist can occur only if the forcing causes an outward - increasing rate of retrograde precession , as for our simplified torus .",
    "more realistic perturbations may not have this effect .",
    "in this section , we return to our canonical simulation (  [ sec : results ] ) with the live halo and the massive disc ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : halores ] shows the orientation of the halo in three spherical bins ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 ) measured from the canonical simulation .",
    "the inner halo ( heavy line ) follows the inner disc ( dashed ) closely , while the outer halo ( light line ) quickly aligns with the outer torus , which has a tip angle @xmath121 and azimuth @xmath122 .",
    "the halo orientation in the middle bin is intermediate .",
    "it is worth stressing that the halo mass interior to @xmath68 is almost five times that of the disc , yet its orientation does not follow that of the outer halo and massive torus , but instead follows that of the lighter disc , which precesses around the axis of the torus because of its angular momentum .",
    "because the massive inner halo is oblate and aligned with the inner disc , it adds significantly to the precession and curving of the lon in the outer disc .",
    "@xcite also found that the inner halo quickly realigns with the disc , even when a large initial misalignment is imposed .",
    "figure [ fig : halodamp ] shows that halo damping of the warp by the live halo is weak .",
    "now for the convenience of description , we name the canonical run as `` run cl '' (  canonical run _ live _ halo ) .",
    "we introduce `` run cr '' (  canonical run _ rigid _",
    "halo ) with the almost same halo potential as in the canonical run except that the halo is rigid and stays exactly spherical .",
    "panel ( a ) shows that nested rings of test particles on circular orbits in a rigid halo precess at constant inclination , @xmath123 , to the plane of the torus .",
    "since rings precess at different rates , the apparent deviations from @xmath34 at later times are caused by averaging rings with the same inclinations , yet different azimuths , over a finite radial range .",
    "( we have verified that the inclinations of individual particles with respect to the torus plane indeed remain close to @xmath34 , as expected . )",
    "panel ( b ) shows that self - gravity in a massive disc causes differential precession about the axis of the inner disc ( run cr ) .",
    "the quasi - periodic modulation of the inclinations of the outer rings in ( b ) is a manifestation of the extra torque from the inner disc .",
    "the initial decrease of the inclinations of most annuli to the torus plane ( between @xmath27 and 600 ) has nothing to do with dynamical friction or halo damping since the halo is rigid in this case .",
    "the final panel , ( c ) , shows the effect of using a live halo ( the canonical run cl ) .",
    "the precession due to the disc is augmented by the aligned flattening of the inner halo , which is partly responsible for the differences from panel ( b ) , but a full explanation of all the details in this figure is complicated ; , we would need to take into account the inclination of the halo at intermediate radii .",
    "the important result is that even after 2000 dynamical times , the mean inclination of the inner disc to the torus has not decreased by more than @xmath124 ; , damping from the live halo is very weak .",
    "our result differs from the conclusions of @xcite and @xcite because the scenarios studied are different .",
    "their models have a very large initial misalignment between the halo and the inner disc and a significant precession rate calculated according to the `` modified tilt mode '' in @xcite .",
    "another difference is that the halos in their models were given no time to adjust to the strong and rapidly - precessing warp initially inserted in .    in our simulations ,",
    "the precession rate of the inner disc is very low , and the inner halo follows its motion closely , as shown in figure  [ fig : halores ] , which is why dynamical friction between the two components is negligible . only the outer halo is misaligned and damping comes mainly from coupling between the inner and outer halo .",
    "such coupling is weak for the isotropic halo models we used @xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with the recent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations by @xcite , which found that the relative orientations of inner ( @xmath125 ) and outer ( @xmath126 ) halo are uncorrelated .",
    "the torque in our model arises from a uniform , massive torus centered on the galaxy and inclined to the disc , as originally adopted by @xcite .",
    "the warp is driven by the quadrupole field of the torus , which varies as @xmath127 , and therefore a less massive torus at a smaller radius has a similar effect , as we have verified in other experiments . however , a weaker perturbation would give rise to a milder warp that would take longer to form .    a natural direct interpretation of the torus",
    "is an idealized representation of the stream of stars and dark matter from a disrupted orbiting satellite , if the mass is sufficiently large .",
    "there are numerous examples of accreted satellites , or companion galaxies orbiting in planes that are misaligned with that of the disc of the host galaxy .",
    "the sgr dwarf and the magellanic clouds are clear examples in the milky way , but their masses are generally on the low side unless their halos are substantial .    on the other hand , the torque from the torus is similar to that of a flattened outer halo , which may also have misaligned angular momentum @xcite .",
    "conceptually , one could separate the halo into two mass components : an outer halo flattened in a plane misaligned with the disc and having a uniform , quasi - spherical core , and the remainder  an inner halo with any arbitrary radial mass profile , that may be strongly peaked to the centre of the galaxy . regardless of how flattened the inner halo may be , it exerts no torque on the inner disc , since it is generally aligned with the disc plane ( see  [ sec : haloresponse ] ) . in this picture ,",
    "the gravitational potential of the outer oblate halo alone might approximate the form : @xmath128 , which arises from a flattened isothermal envelope with a quasi - spherical , uniform core of radius @xmath129 , with a density scale set by @xmath130 .",
    "the ellipticity of the equipotential surfaces @xmath131 is approximately @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the ellipticity of the halo density .",
    "it is easy to show the torque due to this outer halo exerted on a ring in the disc at radius @xmath134 is @xmath135 , which has the same radial dependence as the torque of a uniform torus .",
    "the effects discussed in  [ sec : twist ] and  [ sec : warppersist ] are dependent on the outward - increasing rate of retrograde precession of our model .",
    "the torque from our adopted torus is of the same order of magnitude as such an outer halo with a typical flattening in the range @xmath136 depending on @xmath137 .",
    "cosmological simulations that include baryonic infall have not yet settled on a set of robust predictions for the shape and alignment of the outer halo .",
    "a misaligned potential of the form just described is highly idealized , but has served as a useful theoretical exercise to understand warps .",
    "it has yielded some insight that may capture features of the torques that drive real warps .",
    "the windup rate of a warp depends on the radial variation of the net precession rate .",
    "( the amount of the windup can be measured by @xmath138 , see @xcite . )",
    "forcing by our adopted torus causes differential precession of the opposite sign from that of the disc , making the total retrograde precession less differential , especially in the warp region ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "thus the stiff inner disc and the two precessions work together to slow the windup of the warp .    however , it is more interesting to study the evolution of a pre - warped massive disc without any external forcing .",
    "we therefore conducted two further experiments in which we removed the forcing torus after some evolution .",
    "we ran cases with both live ( cl  torus ) and rigid ( cr  torus ) halos , derived from the canonical runs cl ( live halo ) and cr ( rigid halo ) . in both cases , we gradually removed all the torus particles in a linear fashion between @xmath66 and @xmath140 after which , no torus particles remain .",
    "( note that in all runs the torus mass was grown linearly to its maximum between @xmath27 and 200 . )    in these two runs , a warp was already well developed by @xmath66 .",
    "ramping down the torque from the torus allows us to study the unforced behaviour of the warped disc . in run cr",
    "torus , the disc is affected by its self - gravity only ( because the halo is rigidly spherical ) , but in run cl ",
    "torus , the effect of self - gravity of the live halo is also included .    in figure",
    "[ fig : windup_rigid ] and figure  [ fig : windup_live ] we compare the lon between runs in which the torus was left in place and the cases in which it was removed .",
    "figure  [ fig : windup_rigid ] shows the two cases at @xmath141 for the rigid halo , and figure  [ fig : windup_live ] shows the corresponding two cases with the live halo .",
    "note that both experiments in each pair are identical at @xmath66 .",
    "two results are evident from this comparison , regardless of whether the halo is rigid or live : first , the amplitude of the warp is little changed by the removal of the forcing torus confirming that damping from the halo is weak ; second , the lon in runs with the torus removed is more wound than in runs where the torus remains .",
    "this second point confirms that the torque from the torus is important to balance out the differential precession due to the stiff inner disc , and reduces the windup rate of the warp , but the extra winding is mild even @xmath142 gyr after the torus starts to be taken away .",
    "thus the warp can persist for a few gyrs after the imposed quadrupolar perturbation is removed .",
    "our analysis has shown that the lon of warps in the inner region forms a leading spiral due to the potential of the disc and inner halo .",
    "the fact that the lons of most warps form leading spirals over an extended radial range may also imply that the disc mass is significant in the central region of these galaxies ( e.g. figure  [ fig : tip_lon_add_disk ] ) .",
    "the spirality of the lon at larger radii , on the other hand , contains information on the mass distribution in the outer halo that drives the warp .",
    "for example , if warps are formed by external perturbations that exert torques of the form of our adopted torus , the lon should twist from leading to trailing at some large radius .",
    "the absence of a twist would imply a perturbation of a different form .",
    "we have looked for signs of a twist in the largest sample of galaxies with tip - lon data to date @xcite .",
    "the transition radius @xmath143 for the torus we study (  [ sec : twist ] ) , a value that has a mild dependence on the torus properties ( @xmath144^{-0.2}$ ] ) . if most of the large , late - type spirals in briggs s sample have holmberg radii in the range @xmath145",
    ", we expect @xmath146 and we therefore examine those having lon data beyond @xmath147 .",
    "six galaxies ( ngc 628 , ngc 5055 , ngc 2841 , ngc 1058 , ngc 3344 and m83 ) in this sample have lon data outside @xmath147 .",
    "we find that ngc 628 and ngc 5055 show signs of the lon spirality twist near @xmath147 ; ngc 2841 and ngc 1058 show weak signs of the spirality twist ; the lon of m83 is quite straight near @xmath147 , and might have spirality twist at an even larger radius ; the lon of ngc 3344 is very noisy , but the spiral of the overall lon trend does not seem to twist .",
    "thus perhaps four out of six galaxies reveal hints of spirality twists in their lons .",
    "thus currently available data do not provide convincing evidence for the spirality twist , mainly because the lon data beyond @xmath147 @xcite are generally sparse and noisy .",
    "the outer morphology of the lon is worth more detailed investigation in deeper hi 21 cm observations of gas - rich galaxies , since it may contain valuable information on the shape and profile of the mass distribution in the outer halo .",
    "a when the viewpoint is rotated by @xmath148 from that in figure  [ fig : morph]a . ]      the intrinsic thickness of the disc about its mean inclination is not greatly increased by warping .",
    "comparison of the three panels in figure  [ fig : intr_thick ] reveals that the evolution of the disc thickness is little affected by an aligned torus , and a tilted torus causes only a slight increase for @xmath149 .    but a warped",
    ", luminous disc will contribute some light outside the thin , inner disc which , from some viewing directions ( see figures  [ fig : thickdisk ] ) , may resemble a low - surface brightness thick disc .",
    "suppose an idealized warp that starts from @xmath3 at an angle @xmath150 to the inner disc and has a straight lon .",
    "( we define @xmath150 to be the kink angle between the flat inner disc and the steepest edge of the warp when seen in projection along the lon , it is not the warp angle @xmath57 defined above . ) the projected surface brightness profile along the minor axis of the edge - on disc will clearly be exponential with vertical scale - height @xmath151 , and its brightness is roughly @xmath152 . the angle @xmath153 for the warp in figure  [ fig : morph]a and figures  [ fig : thickdisk ] .",
    "thus , if the warp starts in the luminous disc , it could possibly affect conclusions about thick discs from photometry of edge - on galaxies .",
    "now that the role of a live halo has been properly taken into account , the idea that galaxy warps are manifestations of long - lived warp modes appears to have reached a dead end .",
    "but warps as responses to external forcing remain viable , provided that suitable perturbations are frequent enough .",
    "hierarchical galaxy formation scenarios guarantee late infall within gravitationally bound subgroups , both diffuse and in lumps , and the infalling matter is unlikely to share the angular momentum vector of the early disc and halo @xcite .",
    "the simulations presented here are motivated by this idea , but are limited to an in - depth study of one highly idealized case .",
    "we examine how an initially flat particle - disc with random motion , embedded in a live halo , gradually acquires a warp as a result of a steady , applied external torque . rather than striving for realism ,",
    "we have endeavoured to understand how the warp develops and why the lon generally forms a loosely - wound , leading spiral .    despite having focused mainly on one case , we find a long - lived , large - amplitude warp that resembles those observed in many respects .",
    "the disc is flat in the inner part , and starts to warp at @xmath154 into an open leading spiral , which is consistent with the warping rules found by @xcite .",
    "the external torque causes the disc to precess in a retrograde sense .",
    "the warp develops because the precession rate of the inner disc , which is strongly cohesive due to its self - gravity and random motion , is slower than that of the outer disc .",
    "the growing misalignment between the inner and outer disc gives rise to a new torque acting on the outer disc from the massive inner disc , and the inner halo that is coupled to it .",
    "the torque from the interior mass is responsible for the leading spiral of the line of nodes  our adopted external field alone would produce a trailing spiral .",
    "the fact that the lon of most warps forms a leading spiral over an extended radial range seems to imply a massive disc ( e.g. figure  [ fig : tip_lon_add_disk ] ) .    on the other hand , the leading spiral tells us little about the cause of the warp , but such information might be revealed by the behaviour of the warp at large radii .",
    "we show that the lon twists to trailing at very large radii from our experiments with a perturbation that alone would cause the warp to form a trailing spiral .",
    "thus better observational data on the shape of the lon at very large radii may reveal the radial dependence of the torque that created the warp , and thereby provide information on the shape of the halo at large radii .    because the two separate components of the torque in our model cause differential precessions in opposite senses , the net retrograde precession of the warp is less differential than when only one is present .",
    "the moment we removed the external torque , the warp began to wind , although its amplitude did not decrease .",
    "thus the quasi - steady warp we observe that lasts for more than a hubble time is a consequence of steady external forcing .    even though the disc precesses due to the external torque , its motion is hardly damped over many gyr , in contrast to the expectations from @xcite .",
    "damping is weak because the slow precession rate allows the inner halo to remain closely aligned with the disc , which therefore causes little drag .",
    "the very weak damping seems to be caused more by the relative precession of the inner and outer halo .",
    "a fixed outer torus is clearly unrealistic and external forcing is likely to be strongly time - dependent in reality .",
    "we can not say much about the rate at which misalignments in real halos will settle , but we have shown that the warp survives for a few gigayears after the torus is removed .",
    "time dependence may anyway be a side issue if the halo axis is constantly slewing , as argued by @xcite .",
    "warps formed this way can be repeatedly regenerated when a new infall event happens .",
    "since cosmic infall and mergers are more likely to happen in a denser environment , warps can be induced more frequently in such an environment , which is consistent with the warp statistics in @xcite .    since warps are ubiquitous and a gravitational phenomenon closely related to hierarchical galaxy formation , their properties may possibly be able to constrain small - scale cosmic structure .",
    "clearly further experimentation with various external perturbations , halo profiles and masses , disc properties ( random motions , barredness ) , etc .",
    ", is required to discover what might be inferred from the existence of warps in galaxies .",
