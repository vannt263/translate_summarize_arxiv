    "there is much that is odd about motivic measure if it is judged by measure theory in the sense of twentieth century analysis . it does not fit neatly with the tradition of measure in the style of hausdorff , haar , and lebesgue .",
    "it is best to view motivic measure as something new and different , and to recognize that when it comes to motivic measure , the term ` measure ' is used loosely .",
    "motivic integration has been developing at a break - neck pace , ever since kontsevich gave the first lecture on the topic in 1995 .",
    "this article gives an exposition of the theory of arithmetic motivic measure , as developed by j. denef and f. loeser .",
    "motivic measure will be easier to understand , once two of its peculiarities are explained .",
    "the first peculiarity is that the measure is not real - valued .",
    "rather , it takes values in a scissor group . an introductory section on scissor groups for polygons will recall the basic facts about these groups .",
    "the second peculiarity is that rather than a boolean algebra of measurable sets , we work directly with the underlying boolean formulas that define the sets .",
    "the reasons for working directly with boolean formulas will be described in a second introductory section .",
    "after these two introductory remarks , we will describe ` motivic counting ' in section  [ sec : counting ] .",
    "motivic counting is to ordinary counting what motivic measure is to ordinary measure .",
    "motivic counting will lead into motivic measure .",
    "motivic volume is defined by a process that is similar to the scissor - group construction of the area of polygons in the plane . to draw out the similarities ,",
    "let us recall the construction .",
    "it determines the area of polygons without taking limits .",
    "any polygon in the plane can be cut into finitely many triangles that can be reassembled into a rectangle of unit width .",
    "figure  [ fig : scissor ] illustrates three steps ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ) of the general algorithm .",
    "the algorithm consists of @xmath3 elementary transformations .",
    "( 1 ) triangulate the polygon .",
    "( 2 ) transform triangles into rectangles .",
    "( 3 ) fold long rectangles in half .",
    "( 4 ) rescale each rectangle to give it an edge of unit width .",
    "( 5 ) stack all the unit width rectangles end to end .",
    "the length of the unit width rectangle is the area .",
    "an abelian group encodes these cut and paste operations .",
    "let @xmath4 be the free abelian group on the set of polygons in the plane .",
    "we impose two families of relations :    * scissor relations*. if @xmath5 is a polygon that can be cut into polygons @xmath6 and @xmath7 , then @xmath8 = [ p_1]+[p_2]\\ ] ]    * congruence relations*. if @xmath5 and @xmath9 are congruent polygons then @xmath8 = [ p'].\\ ] ]    the scissor group @xmath10 of polygons is defined as the free abelian group subject to these two families of relations . in some sense , this entire article is an exploration of scissor and congruence relations in diverse contexts . by and by , we will construct several closely related scissor groups @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , each constructed as a free abelian group modulo scissor and congruence relations .",
    "the polygon scissor group @xmath10 of polygons is isomorphic to the additive group of real numbers @xmath15 . under this isomorphism ,",
    "the real number attached to the class @xmath16 $ ] of a polygon is its area .",
    "a group homomorphism from @xmath10 to @xmath15 sends each class @xmath16 $ ] to its area .",
    "it is onto , because there are polygons of every positive real area , and negations of polygons of every negative real area . by scissor and congruence relations ,",
    "every element of the scissor group is represented by the difference of two unit width rectangles . to be in the kernel",
    ", the two rectangles must have the same area ; but then they are congruent , and their difference is the zero element of @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the homomorphism is also one - to - one .",
    "the area function on the set @xmath17 of polygons thus factors through @xmath10 .",

    "motivic measure commits to a position on this issue : the first stage ( @xmath19 $ ] ) is identified as the area - taking process and the second stage @xmath16\\mapsto\\op{area}(p)$ ] is a _ specialization _ of the area . in this case",
    ", specialization is an isomorphism .",
    "our approach to measure in this article is decidedly unsophisticated : taking the measure of something consists in mapping that thing into its scissor group , @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "traditionally , we take the measure of a set @xmath20 ( say a subset of a locally compact space ) , but we do not take the measure of the formula @xmath21 defining a set . with motivic measure , we take the measure of the formula directly . concretely , the formula @xmath22 defines the circle @xmath23 with motivic measure , we take the measure of the equation of the circle ( equation  [ eqn : circle ] ) rather than the measure of the circle itself ( equation  [ eqn : circle - set ] ) .",
    "attention shifts from sets to formulas .",
    "what purpose does it serve to measure formulas rather than the underlying set ? as algebraic geometers are eager to remark , each formula defines an infinite collection of sets .",
    "for instance , for each finite field @xmath24 , we can take the set of @xmath24 points on the circle : @xmath25 we will see that the motivic measure of the formula is a universal measure in the sense that the value it attaches to the formula does not commit us to any particular field . and",
    "yet if we are supplied with a particular field , it will be possible to recover the traditional measure of a set from the motivic measure of its defining formula . in this sense ,",
    "motivic measure is to traditional measures what an algebraic variety is to its set of solutions .",
    "counting is the fountainhead of all measure .",
    "the measure of a finite set is its cardinality . at the risk of belaboring the point , in preparation for what is to come ,",
    "let us recast ordinary counting .",
    "the scissor relation for disjoint finite sets is @xmath26 = [ x ] + [ y].\\ ] ] more generally , if we allow the sets to intersect , it is @xmath26 = [ x ] + [ y ] - [ x\\cap y ] .",

    "the first motivic measure that we present is an analogue of this approach to counting .",
    "we call it the _ motivic counting measure_. the scissor relation will be similar to equation  [ eqn : scissor - set ] .      traditional measure calls for a full discussion of the class of measurable sets . since we work with formulas rather than sets , our approach calls for a full discussion of the class of formulas to be measured .",
    "we allow all syntactically correct formulas built from a countable collection of variables @xmath33 , parentheses , and the symbols @xmath34 more precisely , we allow all formulas in the first - order language of rings .",
    "a formula that has been constructed from these symbols will be called a _ ring formula_. we avail ourselves of the usual mathematical abbreviations and renamings of variables .",
    "we write @xmath1 for @xmath35 , @xmath36 for @xmath37 ( @xmath38 times ) , @xmath39 for @xmath40 , @xmath41 for @xmath42 , and so forth .    with usual abbreviations , @xmath43 is a ring formula , because its syntax is correct . but @xmath44 and @xmath45 are not ring formulas .",
    "we imitate the construction of the scissor groups @xmath10 and @xmath11 to build the scissor group of ring formulas .",

    "two are congruent if there is a bijection between the two sets that is induced by an isometry .",
    "our first guess at the congruence relation for ring formulas is that two ring formulas are congruent if there is a bijection between the sets of solutions for each finite field @xmath24 .",
    "( we limit ourselves to _ finite _ fields because we are attempting to imitate the counting measure of _ finite _ sets . ) however , there are two modifications that we must make to this first guess to arrive at a workable relation .",
    "the first modification is to use pseudo - finite fields rather than finite fields .",
    "pseudo - finite field _ is an infinite perfect field such that every absolutely irreducible variety over the field has a rational point and such that there is a unique field extension of each finite degree ( inside a fixed algebraic closure of the field ) .",
    "the defining properties of a pseudo - finite field are properties possessed by finite fields ( except the part about being infinite ) .",
    "moreover , logicians have found that the behavior of pseudo - finite fields is essentially no different from the generic behavior of finite fields , but they avoid the hassles that appear in positive characteristic . for those seeing pseudo - finite fields for the first time",
    ", it would not be a severe distortion of the facts to ignore the ` pseudo ' and to work instead with finite fields .",
    "the second modification is to require the bijection between the solutions to come from a ring formula that is independent of the underlying field .",
    "we are now ready to state the congruence relations .",
    "* congruence relations*. @xmath48 = [ \\phi']\\ ] ] if there exists a ring formula @xmath49 such that for every pseudo - finite field @xmath50 of characteristic zero , the interpretation of @xmath49 gives a bijection between the tuples in @xmath50 satisfying @xmath21 and the tuples in @xmath50 satisfying @xmath51 .",
    "the congruence relation gives @xmath52 = [ \\lq\\exists x.\\quad x^2      = b^2 - 4 c\\rq]\\ ] ] the formula @xmath49 realizing the congruence and the bijection at the level of points is @xmath53 that is , in every pseudo - finite field of characteristic zero , a monic quadratic polynomial has a root if and only if its discriminant is a square .",
    "the scissor group @xmath12 of ring formulas is defined as the free abelian group subject to the scissor and congruence relations .",
    "the _ counting measure _ of a ring formula @xmath21 is its class @xmath54 $ ] in the scissor group of ring formulas .",
    "there is a trivial sort of fubini theorem for finite sets : the cardinality of a cartesian product of two sets is the product of the cardinalities of the two sets . to make sense of a fubini theorem for ring formulas , it is necessary to introduce products to the scissor groups ; that is , we need a _",

    "in contrast , the general counting measure of a ring formula takes values in a scissor ring whose construction bundles all pseudo - finite fields together",
    ".    we can be precise about the way in which the counting measure bundles the counting measures @xmath64 .",

    "background on m. fried and others work on quantifier elimination can be found in @xcite and @xcite , as well as in an appendix to this article by m. fried .    a formula without quantifiers belongs less to the realm of logic than to the realm of algebraic geometry .",
