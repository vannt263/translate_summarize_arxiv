    "within a year of the discovery of charmonium in 1974 , a picture emerged of two massive quarks moving in the qcd motivated static potential @xcite , @xmath1 here the color coulomb constant @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 in lowest order perturbation theory and @xmath4 is the confinement constant , or asymptotic confining force .",
    "the non - relativistic schrdinger equation accounted in a natural way for the spin averaged @xmath5 and @xmath6 spectra and decay rates @xcite .",
    "it was soon realized that in order to understand the spin dependence of the heavy onia states one must further specify the lorentz transformation properties of the interaction .",
    "henriques , kellett , and moorhouse @xcite proposed that the short range coulombic part was a lorentz vector and the long range confining part a lorentz scalar .",
    "the reasoning by the above group and others @xcite was that in order to account for observations , the spin - orbit interaction must be suppressed by a partial cancelation between the short - range and long - range contributions .",
    "this picture flourished unchallenged for fifteen years despite the lack of success in formally relating scalar confinement to qcd . around 1990 ,",
    "the work of the milan group @xcite clarified this question dramatically .",
    "using the low velocity wilson loop formalism pioneered by eichten and feinberg , and later by gromes @xcite , they found both the spin - dependent and spin - independent relativistic corrections in heavy onia .",
    "their astounding result was that the long - range spin - independent qcd corrections differed from those of scalar confinement , though the long - range spin - orbit corrections were the same pure thomas ones given by scalar confinement .",
    "these results were subsequently verified by lattice simulations of qcd @xcite .    because the spin - independent relativistic corrections to scalar confinement are incorrect , the scalar confinement scenario should logically be discarded .",
    "indeed , the whole concept of potential confinement is in error .",
    "fortunately , there is an alternative physical picture that can be employed .",
    "back in 1982 , buchmller @xcite pointed out that a color electric flux tube should automatically yield the desired pure thomas spin - orbit interaction because there is no color magnetic field in the quark rest frame . in 1992 , it was shown that the spin - independent relativistic corrections @xcite to the flux tube model exactly matched the qcd predictions @xcite .",
    "recently , we have constructed a consistent classical action for spinning quarks connected by a qcd string ( flux tube ) @xcite .",
    "hence there exists a simple physical picture that is consistent in many ways with qcd and is not a simple potential model .",
    "although inconsistent with qcd , scalar confinement models remain popular , probably because of their relative ease of solution . in this paper",
    "we point out an instance where the predictions of spin - independent scalar confinement disagree directly with experiment .",
    "we consider here the dependence of heavy - light ( hl ) meson masses on the light quark mass .",
    "we discuss a general hl potential model wave equation in sec .",
    "[ sec : perturb ] and exhibit a simple analytic perturbative solution for scalar confinement .",
    "we demonstrate the high accuracy of our numerical solutions by comparing them to the analytic ones . in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] we collect and discuss the experimental data which we will compare to our predictions .",
    "in particular , we will establish that spin splittings do not depend on the mass of the light quark .",
    "comparison of three confinement scenarios to data is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] , where we give theoretical values obtained by exact numerical solution of the spinless salpeter equation for both scalar and time component vector ( tcv ) confinement as well as flux tube confinement .",
    "our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] are that scalar confinement predictions of the light quark mass dependence are not good and can be clearly seen in the difference of _ s_-wave and _ p_-wave meson states .",
    "we note further that electric ( tcv ) confinement also does not account for this difference but that the flux tube model exhibits remarkable agreement with experimental data .",
    "we consider a spinless quark of mass @xmath7 that moves in a potential field .",
    "we assume that this field consists of central lorentz scalar and time component vector fields , @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "the expected lagrangian for this system is @xmath10 the momentum and hamiltonian are then @xmath11 where @xmath12 .    by squaring @xmath13 , we see that @xmath14 substitution into the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) then yields @xmath15    for a state of definite angular momentum @xmath16 the momentum square can be written @xmath17    with the usual replacement @xmath18 , we obtain a wave equation that can always be solved numerically @xcite .",
    "we next consider a simple model with scalar confinement , @xmath19 and a time component vector short range interaction , @xmath20 . from the general hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) ,",
    "we find    @xmath21    we wish to treat the short range parameter @xmath2 and the light quark mass @xmath7 as small perturbations . in the case where both @xmath2 and @xmath7 vanish , the zeroth order hamiltonian is @xmath22    the hamiltonian @xmath23 has the same eigenstates as its square which , with the replacements of eq .",
    "( [ psph ] ) and @xmath24 , leads to the harmonic oscillator equation , @xmath25 where in the limit of small @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 is normalized to @xmath29 the solution for the wave function and eigenvalue is standard ; @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the usual laguerre polynomial , @xmath32 is a positive integer starting with @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is a non - negative integer starting with zero .",
    "we now determine the effect of turning on @xmath2 and @xmath7 using the feynman - hellmann theorem @xcite , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is any parameter of the hamiltonian .",
    "taking the expectation values using the @xmath37 wavefunctions ( [ soln0 ] ) will yield an expansion in these parameters . to",
    "leading order we have @xmath38    the expectation values are worked out in general in the appendix . here",
    "we only consider the @xmath7 and @xmath2 dependence of the 1__s _ _ and 1__p _ _ states ( i.e. , @xmath39 and @xmath40 and @xmath33 ) .",
    "the results are , @xmath41    using eq .",
    "( [ expan ] ) , we obtain the @xmath7 dependence near @xmath37 ( @xmath7 slope ) for the energies , @xmath42 again using eq .",
    "( [ expan ] ) we obtain the @xmath2 dependence near @xmath37 ( @xmath2 slope ) for the energies , @xmath43      before we proceed to a detailed comparison of the predictions of scalar confinement with the experimental data , we pause to verify the accuracy of our numerical method . in particular , we compare our analytic values for the slopes at @xmath44 in eqs .",
    "( [ me1s ] ) to ( [ kdiff ] ) with our numerical method .",
    "this step is important because a general analytic solution of the spinless salpeter equation is not known . only for the remarkable case of a massless particle and linear scalar confinement , which is equivalent to the non - relativistic harmonic oscillator",
    ", can one obtain an analytic solution . in the general case",
    ", one must rely on exact numerical solutions .",
    "some time ago , we introduced @xcite a variational method , the galerkin method , into particle physics to solve the spinless salpeter equation with a time component vector interaction .",
    "this very robust method is applicable to a wide range of differential and integral equations .",
    "the method has been sharpened over the years by many authors @xcite .",
    "one can cope with eigenvalue equations for operators that are complicated functions of both momenta and coordinates , such as the scalar confinement hamiltonian ( [ hams ] ) , by using basis functions that can be fourier transformed .",
    "we have performed a careful numerical solution of the eigenvalue equation for the hamiltonian ( [ hams ] ) , for small @xmath2 and @xmath7 , and found the @xmath7 and @xmath2 slopes .",
    "the results are in excellent agreement with the values obtained by analytic calculation in eqs .",
    "( [ me1s ] ) through ( [ kdiff ] ) .",
    "we first use experimental data to demonstrate , rather conclusively , that spin splittings within a given orbital angular momentum multiplet do not depend on the light quark mass .",
    "in particular , we consider several heavy - light meson spin multiplets in which both the strange and non - strange members have been observed @xcite .",
    "first we examine the @xmath0 and @xmath45 type mesons with @xmath46 ( _ s_-waves ) .",
    "the hyperfine splittings for @xmath45 and @xmath0 mesons are @xmath47 the corresponding _",
    "s_-wave hyperfine splittings for @xmath48 type states are @xmath49 it is clear that the substitution of a strange quark for a non - strange light quark changes the _",
    "s_-wave hyperfine differences by at most a few mev .",
    "we next consider some measured _ p_-wave heavy - light spin splittings . from @xcite",
    "we find , @xmath50    again we note the apparent vanishing of light quark mass dependence this time in a _",
    "p_-wave spin splitting .",
    "we conclude that spin splittings are only weakly dependent on the light quark mass .",
    "we will exploit this fact in section [ subsec : conclusion ] .      in the preceding subsection we observed from experiment that both _ s_-wave and _ p_-wave heavy - light spin splittings ( within a spin multiplet ) were independent of the light quark mass .",
    "we next consider the mass splittings between pairs of states corresponding to different orbital angular momenta and examine the light quark mass dependence of this difference .",
    "we choose the @xmath52 _ p_-wave state and the pseudoscalar @xmath0 meson .",
    "the best measurements are @xmath53 when the @xmath54 light quark is replaced by a strange quark , the corresponding difference becomes @xmath55 the differences @xmath56 and @xmath57 are amazingly similar .",
    "we see that they differ by @xmath58      we demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ subsec : spinsplit ] that both _",
    "s_- and _ p_-wave spin splittings are , within error and isospin uncertainty , independent of light quark mass .",
    "we may therefore conclude that the @xmath7-dependence of the difference @xmath59 also represents the @xmath7-dependence of the spin - averaged 1__p__@xmath511_s _ excitation energies .",
    "to show this explicitly , we write the hl meson mass as the sum of the heavy quark mass and the excitation energy , @xmath60 we then separate the excitation energy into spin - averaged and spin - dependent parts , @xmath61 as in eqs .",
    "( [ spd ] ) and ( [ spsd ] ) , we define @xmath57 and @xmath56 to be the differences between _ p_-wave ( @xmath62 ) and _ s_-wave ( @xmath63 ) states , for strange and non - strange light quarks respectively . using our observation that the spin - dependent parts are essentially independent of light quark mass , we see that the spin dependent parts will cancel in the difference @xmath64 .",
    "thus @xmath65 measures the light quark mass dependence of the spin - independent 1__p__@xmath511_s _ level difference .",
    "two main results emerge from this subsection .",
    "first , the light quark mass dependence is only about 2% of the measured level difference .",
    "this is a useful tool in the analysis of heavy - light spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "second , although it is small , @xmath66 is definitely not zero .",
    "we will use the actual value ( [ diff ] ) to test the predictions of various assumptions about the nature of quark confinement .",
    "we are now prepared to compare carefully the different confinement predictions with experiment .",
    "as we originally noted @xcite , the @xmath7 dependences of all the heavy - light states are amazingly similar .",
    "we have also noted in sec .",
    "[ subsec : consistency ] that this universal @xmath7 dependence is nearly satisfied in an analytical calculation . in the example with scalar confinement , the @xmath7 slope for the difference 1__p__@xmath511_s _ is about 30 times smaller than each separate slope .",
    "furthermore , we noted in sec .",
    "[ subsec : massdiff ] that when one compares two heavy - light states , one _ p_-wave and one _ s_-wave , the difference changes by less than 2% when a non - strange light quark is replaced by a strange one .",
    "this change is not zero however , but for the @xmath52 and @xmath0 states has the experimental value ( [ diff ] ) @xmath67 in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] we show the numerical mass splittings of heavy - light mesons for three different confinement scenarios , all with the same short range energy @xmath68 , and the same @xmath69 , as a function of light quark mass .",
    "each of the three confinement scenarios has the same asymptotic confinement force , @xmath70  gev@xmath71 .",
    "the upper curve assumes linear scalar confinement , the middle curve is the prediction of the relativistic flux tube and the lower curve linear time component vector confinement . in the scalar and time component vector potentials , the potentials @xmath8 and",
    "the long - range part of @xmath9 respectively are @xmath72 . in the case",
    "relativistic flux tube model the string tension is @xmath4 .",
    "1_s _ energy level difference on the light quark mass @xmath7 .",
    "the numerical results compare different confinement mechanisms ( all with the same long range confinement force @xmath70  gev@xmath71 and all three calculations assume the same short range coulombic constant @xmath69.)[fig : one ] ]    we note that the scalar confinement has the most rapid increase of the 1__p__@xmath511_s _ difference as the light quark mass increases .",
    "the flux tube confinement is intermediate and time component vector linear confinement actually decreases slightly . using the reasonable values for the strange quark mass ( 500 mev ) and the non - strange mass ( 300 mev ) @xcite , we find the following values for @xmath66 , @xmath73 in comparing these values to the experimental value given in eq .",
    "( [ diff ] ) , @xmath74 we observe that both scalar confinement and time component vector confinement are quite inconsistent with the experimental result . however , the flux tube confinement prediction is in agreement with the experimental result .",
    "these results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] .",
    "1_s _ energy gap between a light quark mass value of 500  mev and 300  mev .",
    "the experimental value is the dot below the 10  mev level .",
    "all theoretical predictions have the same long range confinement force , @xmath70  gev@xmath71 , and the same short range coulombic constant , @xmath69.[fig : two ] ]",
    "the reader may have noticed that the @xmath7 slope for the 1__p__@xmath511_s _ difference calculated analytically ( [ mdiff ] ) is about 0.02 whereas the @xmath7 slope in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] is about five times larger .",
    "this is because the coulomb constant @xmath2 is zero in the analytical result and has the more realistic value 0.5 in the numerical calculations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] .",
    "the effect is magnified due to the strong cancelation in the 1__p__@xmath511_s _ difference .",
    "the choice @xmath69 is quite reasonable .",
    "as we noted in @xcite , the spin - averaged experimental value for @xmath75 can be extracted from the @xmath45 mesons ; @xmath76 the appropriate choice of @xmath2 is determined by computing the above quantity as a function of @xmath2 as shown in fig .  [ fig : three ] .",
    "we conclude that the common value of @xmath69 assumed in the considerations of the last section was appropriate and that the effect of a slightly larger @xmath2 would only make our conclusions stronger .",
    "1_s _ level difference as a function of the coulomb constant @xmath2 for scalar confinement . in this case",
    "there is a noticeable dependence on the light quark mass @xmath7 and we show the calculation for @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 mev . since the experimental value was found for @xmath45 mesons we see a value of @xmath80 is indicated with @xmath81 mev.[fig : three ] ]      another interesting result of a choice of confinement scenario is a constraint that relates the non - strange and strange light quark masses .",
    "this relation is the result of the measured value for the @xmath82 and @xmath48 mass difference , @xmath83     and @xmath84 light quark masses due to the measured @xmath85 mass difference ( [ bdiff ] ) .",
    "the solid curve assumes scalar confinement while the dashed curve is due to flux - tube confinement .",
    "the `` data '' points are quark masses analyses of hyperon magnetic moments in the constituent quark model @xcite .",
    "[ fig : four ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : four ] we show this constraint scalar confinement and flux tube confinement scenarios .",
    "although the curves differ considerably for small light quark mass , they are quite similar in the larger range . on the figure",
    "we show constituent quark masses obtained by analyses of hyperon magnetic moments @xcite .",
    "the result justifies our choice of 500 mev for the strange quark and 300 mev for the non - strange quark .",
    "our points in this paper may be quickly summarized .    * from the data , we conclude that spin splittings do not vary with light quark mass value .",
    "we then can extract the change ( [ diff ] ) in the spin - averaged 1__p__@xmath511_s _ level difference as one replaces the non - strange by a strange light quark .",
    "* we compare the predictions of the scalar potential , time component vector potential and flux - tube quark confinement scenarios with experimental results , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] .",
