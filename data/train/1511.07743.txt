    "from the first attempts in the nineteenth century to account for the effects of randomness in nature , fluctuations have been recognized as a fundamental component in the description of several physical , chemical and biological systems @xcite .",
    "a stochastic description can be formulated in continuous or discrete time for systems whose phase space is continuous , or embedded in a lattice . for many of these systems , brownian motion and diffusion models have proven to be key conceptualizations , mathematically accessible and useful for characterizing their statistical behavior @xcite .",
    "random walks and diffusion processes evolve in certain regions of their phase space according to the equations or rules governing their dynamics .",
    "complementary to dynamics , boundary conditions shape the probability distribution of the system being in a given state at certain time . in this sense ,",
    "different scenarios are prescribed by different combinations of boundary conditions @xcite . among these scenarios , first - passage - time ( fpt ) problems -also referred to as exit or escape times- represent a wide class of situations @xcite , where the random variable of interest is the time at which certain state conditions are met first .",
    "the statistics of this and other related variables , such as survival probability , are relevant in many fields and contexts @xcite .",
    "examples abound in different disciplines : diffusion - influenced reactions @xcite , the channel - assisted membrane transport of metabolites , ions , or polymers @xcite and , in general , the variety of processes orchestrating intracellular transport @xcite , force - induced unbinding processes and the reconstruction of potential functions in experiments of single - molecule force spectroscopy @xcite , the random search and first encounters of mobile or immobile targets by a variety of agents , from foraging animals to proteins @xcite , including transport - limited reactions in active media @xcite , the absorption of particles in restricted geometries @xcite and , generically , geometry - controlled kinetics @xcite , escape from confined domains through narrow pores @xcite as well as through large windows @xcite , the granular segregation of binary mixtures @xcite , the formation of loops in nucleic acids and the cyclization of polymers @xcite , and finally , the nucleation and stochastic self - assembly of monomers @xcite , to name a few .",
    "a particularly interesting fpt problem arises in the context of spiking neurons . in general",
    ", a neuron accumulates input currents up to a point at which its dynamics become independent of the inputs , and then generates a large excursion in its phase space in a relatively short period of time , producing a kind of stereotyped event called an _",
    "action potential _ or a _ spike _ @xcite . to a large extent",
    ", these spikes form the basis of neuronal communication .",
    "simplified models of spike generation take advantage of the large reproducibility of action potentials by splitting the dynamics in two phases : the phase where inputs and internal processes drive the neuron , i.e. the regime of sub - threshold integration , and the phase where the spike is manifested itself , which is not represented in detail but prescribed by a fire - and - reset rule @xcite .",
    "these _ integrate - and - fire _ ( if ) models have different versions according to the processes included during the sub - threshold integration @xcite .",
    "however , all of them produce spikes by declaration once the voltage reaches a certain threshold for the first time .",
    "then , the voltage is reset to a lower potential , which is the initial condition for the sub - threshold integration of the following spike . because of how spikes are defined in these models , the relationship to fpt problems is straightforward . on the other hand ,",
    "the reproducibility of _ spike times _ is not as precise as expected from deterministic systems @xcite .",
    "this randomness is accounted for by different stochastic phenomena ( ionic gating , neuro - transmitter release , etc ) , which are normally incorporated in these models by adding noise -in general , gaussian white or colored noise .",
    "overall , the stochastic dynamics of the sub - threshold integration of if models is equivalent to the motion of a brownian particle ( where different versions correspond to different potentials ) , whereas the presence of the threshold for declaring spikes sets the definition of the fpt @xcite",
    ".    one of the processes that greatly affects spike production is the presence of adaptation currents .",
    "they are putatively responsible for the widespread observed phenomenon of spike frequency adaptation , where a neuron s discharge rate decreases in response to a step stimulus @xcite . the simplest version of adaptive if models incorporates an additive current that decreases exponentially in time during sub - threshold evolution , and enables history - dependent behavior in the spike - and - reset rule @xcite .",
    "therefore , the first step towards developing a full understanding of the effect of spike - triggered adaptation currents on interspike interval statistics is to analyze the fpt problem of a brownian motion -given by the associated if model under analysis- with a superimposed exponentially decaying additive drift .",
    "this problem was partially covered by lindner in 2004 , in which he derived general expressions for the corrections to the moments of fpt distribution in a general time - dependent case , and assessed some particular explicit solutions to the first order moments in the case of exponential temporal driving @xcite . to address the full fpt statistics of the temporally inhomogeneous problems that exponential time - dependent drift poses",
    ", we previously analyzed the survival probability and the fpt distribution based on the backward fokker - planck ( fp ) equation , and inductively solved the system of infinite recurrence equations that results from the proposal of a series solution .",
    "this approach was derived for the simple case of a wiener process , corresponding to the _ perfect _ if model in the spiking neurons framework @xcite . here",
    ", we aim to extend these results to a system where the main driving force derives from an arbitrary potential .",
    "furthermore , we were able to obtain the explicit solution to the ornstein - uhlenbeck process , which corresponds to the _ leaky _ if model in the context of spiking neurons .",
    "traditionally , this is considered to be the minimal biologically realistic if model @xcite , obtained as a diffusion approximation of the stein model @xcite .",
    "first , the methodology we use later to study the first - passage - time problem in a time - inhomogeneous setup is reviewed in a classical context : a particle driven exclusively by an arbitrary unidimensional potential @xcite .",
    "even when different approaches can be taken , we focus on the analysis of the survival probability via the backward fokker - planck equation . under this framework ,",
    "the posterior analysis of a superimposed exponential time - dependent drift has proven to be mathematically tractable @xcite .",
