    "it is not even @xmath11conservative ; i.e. , there exists a @xmath11formula , in theories which can interpret enough arithmetic , which is true but unprovable in those theories .",
    "thus one way of comparing the strength of a theory @xmath3 over one of its sub - theories @xmath12 is considering the @xmath11conservativeness of @xmath3 over @xmath12 . and gdel s second incompleteness theorem provides such a @xmath11candidate : @xmath13 , the statement of the consistency of @xmath12 . by that theorem @xmath14 , but if @xmath15 then @xmath3 is not @xmath11conservative over @xmath12 .",
    "examples abound in mathematics and logic : zermelo - frankel set theory @xmath16 is not @xmath11conservative over peano s arithmetic @xmath17 , because @xmath18 but @xmath19 . inside @xmath17",

    "then below the theory @xmath23 things get more complicated : for @xmath11separating @xmath24 over @xmath5 the candidate @xmath25 does not work , because @xmath26 . for this @xmath11separation ,",
    "paris and wilkie @xcite suggested the notion of cut - free consistency instead of usual - hilbert style - consistency predicate . here",
    "one can show that @xmath27 , and then it was presumed that @xmath28 , where @xmath29 stands for cut - free consistency . but this presumption took a rather long time to be established . meanwhile , pudlk in @xcite established the @xmath11separation of @xmath24 over @xmath5 by other methods , and mentioned the unprovability of @xmath30 in @xmath5 as an open problem . this problem is interesting in its own right .",
    "indeed gdel s second incompleteness theorem has been generalized to all consistent theories containing robinson s arithmetic @xmath31 , in the case of hilbert consistency ; see @xcite .",
    "but for cut - free consistency it is still an open problem whether the theorem holds for @xmath31 , and its not too strong extensions .",
    "this is a double strengthening of gdel s second incompleteness theorem : weakening the theory and weakening the consistency predicate .",
    "let us note that since cut - free provability is stronger than usual hilbert provability ( with a super - exponential cost ) , then cut free consistency is a weaker notion of consistency .",
    "indeed , proving gdel s second incompleteness theorem for weak notions of consistencies in weak arithmetics turns out to be a difficult problem .",
    "we do not intend here to give a thorough history of this ongoing research area , let us just mention a few results :    @xmath32 z. adamowicz was the first one to demonstrate the unprovability of cut free consistency in bounded arithmetics , by proving in an unpublished manuscript in 1999 ( later appeared as a technical report @xcite ) that the tableau consistency of @xmath4 is not provable in itself . later with p. zbierski",
    "( 2001 ) she proved gdel s second incompleteness theorem for herbrand consistency of @xmath33 ( see @xcite ) , and a bit later she gave a model theoretic proof of it in 2002 ; see @xcite .",
    "@xmath32 d. e. willard introduced an @xmath34provable @xmath11formula @xmath35 and showed that any theory whose axioms contains @xmath36 can not prove its own tableaux consistency .",
    "he also showed that tableaux consistency of @xmath5 is not provable in itself , see @xcite ; this proved the conjecture of paris and wilkie mentioned above .",
    "@xmath32 s. salehi ( see @xcite chapter 3 and also @xcite ) showed the unprovability of herbrand consistency of a re - axiomatization of @xmath5 in itself , the proof of which was heavily based on @xcite .",
    "the re - axiomatization used @xmath37 , the theory of the positive fragment of a discretely ordered ring , as the base theory , instead of @xmath31 , and assumed two @xmath34derivable sentences as axioms .",
    "also the model - theoretic proof of z. adamowicz in @xcite was generalized to the @xmath4 case in chapter 5 of @xcite . a polished and updated proof of it appears in the present paper .",
    "@xmath38 l. a. koodziejczyk showed in @xcite that the notion of herbrand consistency can not @xmath11separate the hierarchy of bounded arithmetics ( this @xmath11separation is still an open problem ) .",
    "main results are the existence of an @xmath39 for any given @xmath40 such that @xmath41 , and the existence of a natrual @xmath39 such that @xmath42 , where @xmath43 stands for herbrand consistency .",
    "@xmath38 z. adamowicz and k. zdanowski have obtained some results on the unprovability of the relativized notion of herbrand consistency in theories containing @xmath4 ; see @xcite .",
    "their paper contains some insightful ideas about the notion of herbrand consistency .    for @xmath4",
    "the arguments are rather smoother , in comparison to the case of @xmath5 .",
    "our proof for the main theorem on @xmath4 borrows many ideas from @xcite , the major difference being the coding techniques and making use of a more liberal definition of herbrand consistency .",
    "the definition of @xmath43 given in @xcite and @xcite depends on a special coding given there . for reading the present paper no familiarity with @xcite",
    "is needed , but a theorem of @xcite will be of critical use here ( theorem [ th2 ] ) .",
    "we will even use a modified version of it ( theorem [ ij1 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath5 we will see that our definition of @xmath43 is not best suited for this theory ; and we will actually tailor it for @xmath5 .",
    "a hint for the obstacles in tackling herbrand consistency in @xmath5 can be found in chapters 3 and 4 of @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we introduce the ingredients of herbrand s theorem from the scratch , and then explain how they can be arithmetized by gdel coding .",
    "this sets the stage for section 3 in which we formalize the notion of herbrand model and use it to prove our main theorem for @xmath4 . finally in section 4",
    "we modify our definitions and theorems to fit the @xmath5 case . after pinpointing the places where we have made an essential use of @xmath44 ,",

    "we finish the paper with some conclusions and some open questions .",

    "the second subsection gets more technical with gdel coding , for which some familiarity with @xcite is presumed .",
    "skolemizing a formula is usually performed on prenex normal forms ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and since prenex normalizing a formula is not necessarily done in a unique way , then one may get different skolemized forms of a formula .",
    "for example , the tautology @xmath45 can be prenex normalized into either @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "these two formulas can be skolemized respectively as @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a new unary function symbol , and @xmath51 is a new constant symbol . here",
    "we briefly describe a way of skolemizing a ( not - necessarily prenex normal ) formula which results in a somehow unique ( up to a variable renaming ) formula .",
    "a formula is in _ negation normal _ form when the implication symbol does not appear in it , and the negation symbol appears in front of atomic formulas only",
    ". a formula can be ( uniquely ) negation normalized by the following rewriting rules : @xmath52 a formula is called _ rectified _ if no variables appears both bound and free in it , and different quantifiers refer to different variables .",
    "a formula is called _ rectified negation normal _ if it is both negation normalized and rectified . again",
    ", any formula can be rectified .",
    "indeed , any given formula is equivalent to its rectified negation normal form ( rnnf ) which can be obtained from the formula in a unique ( up to a variable renaming ) way ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "now we introduce skolem functions for existential formulas : for any ( not necessarily rnnf ) formula of the form @xmath53 , let @xmath54 be a new @xmath55ary function symbol where @xmath56 is the number of the free variables of @xmath53 .",
    "when @xmath57 then @xmath54 will obviously be a new constant symbol ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath58 be an rnnf formula .",
    "define @xmath59 by induction :    * @xmath60 for atomic or negated - atomic @xmath58 ; * @xmath61 for @xmath62 and rnnf formulas @xmath63 ; * @xmath64 ; * @xmath65 $ ] where @xmath66 are the free variables of @xmath67 and the formula @xmath68 $ ] results from the formula @xmath59 by replacing all the occurrences of the variable @xmath69 with the term @xmath70 .",
    "the skolemized form of any ( not necessarily rnnf ) formula @xmath71 is obtained in the following way : using the above rewriting rules we negation normalize @xmath71 and then rename the repetitive variables ( if any ) to get a rectified negation normal form of @xmath71 , say @xmath58 .",
    "then we get @xmath59 by the above definition , and remove all the ( universal ) quantifiers in it ( together with the variables next to them ) .",
    "we denote thus resulted skolemized form of @xmath71 by @xmath72.@xmath73    note that @xmath72 can be obtained from @xmath71 in a unique ( up to a variable renaming ) way , and it is an open ( quantifier - less ) formula . for the above example @xmath74 , assuming that @xmath75 is atomic , we get    @xmath76    and thus @xmath77    an skolem instance of the formula @xmath71 is any formula resulted from substituting the free variables of @xmath72 with some terms .",

    "the proof is omitted , though it is not too difficult to prove it directly ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "one other concept is needed for formalizing herbrand consistency of arithmetical theories : _",
    "evaluation_.    throughout the paper we deal with closed ( or ground ) terms ( i.e. , terms with no variable ) and for simplicity we call them  term \" . for this to make sense , we may assume that the language of the theory under consideration has at least one constant symbol .",

    "the first point can be dealt with by tailoring the definition of @xmath43 for @xmath5 :    a theory @xmath3 is called herbrand consistent@xmath577 , denoted symbolically as @xmath578 , when for all set of terms @xmath84 , if @xmath320 exists then there is an @xmath120evaluation on @xmath84.@xmath73    this , obviously , can again be formalized in the language of arithmetic .",
    "the new definition can not harm our arguments too much , because we needed @xmath43 only for some special set of terms .",
    "and it was @xmath343 for a non - standard @xmath364 where @xmath551 . for constructing the model @xmath335 we already needed the existence of @xmath363 ( see the beginning of the proof of theorem [ o1h ] before lemma [ lemm1 ] ) .",
    "thus if we require the existence of @xmath320 in the definition of @xmath576 , then we will need the existence of @xmath363 later in the proof !",
    "thus the first deficiency can be overcome .      in the absence of @xmath398",
    "we can not define the above sequence @xmath570 satisfying @xmath581 . the most we can do inside @xmath5 is to define a sequence like @xmath582 where @xmath583 and @xmath584 for some fixed @xmath585 . then @xmath586 .",
    "thus we can not get anything larger than @xmath587 , and so for shortening a witness we should start from @xmath270 and remain in the realm of @xmath588 . indeed by the arguments of the beginning of the proof of theorem [ o1h ] before lemma [ lemm1 ] we did not need the existence of @xmath589 for the existence of @xmath363 .",
    "we needed only @xmath590 .",
    "thus it seems natural to consider the cut @xmath591\\}$ ] and its logarithm @xmath592\\}$ ] .",
    "we first note that adamowicz s theorem ( theorem [ th2 ] ) holds for @xmath5 and any @xmath593 ; i.e. , there exists a bounded formula whose @xmath594witness can not _ consistently _ be shortened to @xmath595 .",
    "indeed this theorem holds for any cut @xmath596 and its logarithm which is definition the cut @xmath597\\}$ ] . the only relation between @xmath274 and @xmath595 needed in the proof of theorem [ th1 ]",
    "is that @xmath598 ; see @xcite .",
    "and the proof works for any cut @xmath596 and @xmath599 which satisfy @xmath600 .",
    "the cuts @xmath579 and @xmath580 defined above satisfy this as well ( @xmath601 ) .",
    "so , we repeat theorem [ th1 ] as :    [ ij1 ] there exists a bounded formula @xmath377 such that the theory @xmath602 is consistent , but @xmath603 is not consistent.@xmath73      let us note that the following theorem together with theorem [ ij1 ] prove that @xmath604 .",
    "[ ij2 ] for any bounded formula @xmath383 , if the theory @xmath605 is consistent then so is the theory @xmath606 .",
    "suppose the theory @xmath607 is consistent .",
    "so there exists a model @xmath608 where @xmath402",
    ". we will show the consistency of @xmath609 by constructing another model @xmath610 if @xmath548 is standard ( i.e. , @xmath611 ) then one can take @xmath550 .",
    "but if @xmath612 is non - standard , then we proceed as follows :    let @xmath236 where @xmath226 is the skolem function symbol for the formula @xmath613 and @xmath51 is the skolem constant symbol for the sentence ( see example [ exampleb ] )    @xmath614 .    we can use the argument of example [ exampleb ] , since for the bounded formula @xmath615 , the sentence @xmath214 is an axiom of the theory @xmath5 .",
    "take @xmath616 in which the terms @xmath404 s and @xmath617 s are defined inductively as @xmath405 , @xmath553 ; and @xmath618 , @xmath619 .",
    "now @xmath363 is of order @xmath590 which exists by the assumption @xmath620 .",
    "then by theorem [ log4 ] for a non - standard @xmath364 the set of terms @xmath343 has a code in @xmath417 .",
    "thus the assumption @xmath621 implies that there must exists an @xmath34evaluation @xmath154 on @xmath343 .",
    "then one can form the model @xmath537 . now",
    "@xmath622 by lemma  [ lm : mlambdap ] , and also @xmath623 by the definition of @xmath624 ( which represents @xmath625 ) .",
    "note that @xmath626 by the argument of example  [ exampleb ] , and also the code of the sequence @xmath627 is of order @xmath628 which exists since @xmath629 .",
    "finally , @xmath561 by corollary [ last ] ( of theorem [ bounded ] ) .",
    "whence @xmath562 is a model of the theory @xmath609 ; what proves its consistency .",
    "an important property of herbrand consistency of the theories @xmath4 and @xmath5 has been proved .",
    "that property immediately implies gdel s second incompleteness theorem for the notion of herbrand consistency in those theories .",
    "however , this version of gdel s theorem has come a long way .",
    "the original presumption of paris & wilkie @xcite asked for a proof of @xmath630 , without specifying any variant of cut - free consistency @xmath29 :  presumably @xmath630 although we do not know this at present \" .",
    "willard @xcite solved this problem for the tableau consistency variant .",
    "pudlk @xcite asked a more specific question :  we know only that @xmath631 for @xmath3 containing at least @xmath24 , for weaker theories it is an open problem \" .",
    "in @xcite this problem was studied for the theories @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( and a theory in between these two , namely @xmath5 plus the totality of the @xmath632 function ) .",
    "the proof of @xmath633 given here was presented for the first time in chapter 5 of @xcite .",
    "but the unprovability of @xmath634 in @xmath5 was not as easy as it would have seemed . in chapter 3 of @xcite",
    "this unprovability was proved for a re - axiomatization of @xmath5 .",
    "our reason for using the induction formula @xmath214 , where @xmath215 is the bounded formula @xmath635 , was having an skolem function symbol for squaring @xmath636 .",
    "this way the gdel code of @xmath637 is @xmath638 for a fixed @xmath639 , and thus the code of @xmath640 is @xmath641 which is of order @xmath642 .",
    "so , we could code a term representing the number @xmath643 ( = @xmath640 ) by a number of order @xmath642 .",
    "but if we coded the number @xmath643 directly , that would be the code of @xmath644 ( with @xmath645 ) which is of order @xmath646 or @xmath647 . in that case , the code of the sequence @xmath627 would be of order @xmath648 , but we used the order @xmath649 in the proof of theorem [ ij2 ] ( since we had at most @xmath650 in our disposal - which is far less than @xmath648 ) .",
    "that way , we avoided accepting the totality of the squaring function @xmath651 as an ( additional ) axiom .",
    "this point deserves another look : define the terms @xmath652 , @xmath653 , and @xmath654 inductively as @xmath655 , @xmath656 ; @xmath657 , @xmath658 ; and @xmath659 , @xmath660 .",
    "then the codes of the terms @xmath661 s and @xmath662 s are of order @xmath663 , but the code of @xmath662 s are of order @xmath664 . on the other hand , the terms @xmath665 , @xmath666 and @xmath667 have the same value ( @xmath668 ) in any model of @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath430 we have @xmath669 and also @xmath670 ; but @xmath667 s are too big to fit in small sets of terms .",
    "our treatment of gdel s second incompleteness theorem for herbrand consistency in weak arithmetics , can be summarized in the following improvements to the classical treatments ( cf .",
    "the first paragraph of appendix e in @xcite ) :        \\(3 ) for logarithmic shortening of bounded witnesses in @xmath5 , we could not go from @xmath270 to @xmath588 directly . instead we used the condition @xmath671 ( equivalently @xmath672 ) to get to @xmath673 ( equivalently @xmath674 ) . for that we used the improved version of adamowicz s theorem @xcite ( theorem [ ij1 ] ) .",
    "\\(4 ) and finally , we used the trick of @xmath214 to get an skolem function symbol for the squaring function .",
    "ideally , one would not use any induction axiom for proving a formula like @xmath675 .",
    "this is an @xmath180derivable sentence , and adding it as an axiom seems much more natural than proving it by an inductive argument .",
    "but , fortunately , there was a way of avoiding the acceptance of @xmath676 as an axiom , and that was proving its @xmath11equivalent @xmath677 by induction on its bounded part @xmath635 ( see example [ exampleb ] and the proof of theorem  [ ij2 ] ) .",
    "that induction axiom could give us a free skolem function symbol for the squaring operation , provided that we did not prenex normalize the induction axiom , and instead skolemize it more effectively @xmath678 see point ( 1 ) above .",
    "prenex normalizing and then skolemizing the induction axioms can be so cumbersome that many would prefer avoiding them , but accepting new axioms instead ! trying to prenex normalize the induction axiom @xmath214 for @xmath679 in example [ exampleb ] can give a hint for its difficulty .    in the end",
    ", we conjecture that by using our coding techniques and definitions of herbrand consistency , the results of l. a. koodziejczyk @xcite can be generalized for showing the following unprovability :                  ;  lower bounds for the unprovability of herbrand consistency in weak arithmetics \" submitted for publication ( date on manuscript : 9 dec .",
