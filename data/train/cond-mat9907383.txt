    "the many - fermion problem has a long history due to its importance in condensed matter physics .",
    "historically , this problem has been studied using either many - body perturbation theory @xcite , or landau s fermi - liquid theory @xcite . in recent years various aspects of the many - fermion problem have been examined using renormalization group ( rg ) and field theoretic techniques .",
    "much of this work has been done on clean fermion systems , applying the rg approach either directly to the grassmann field theory for fermions @xcite , or to a composite field theory that describes boson - like excitations in a fermion system @xcite . among the results of this new approach",
    "are a rg derivation of fermi - liquid theory starting from a microscopic theory , and the introduction of the fermi - liquid fixed point notion .",
    "other results include rg derivations of the cooper instability problem and of the random - phase approximations that lead to , e.g. , screening",
    ".    for disordered electronic systems the rg approaches developed for clean fermi systems are not directly applicable , because the sets of soft modes are very different for the two cases .",
    "however , a field - theoretic description based on composite variables that are bilinear in the basic fermionic fields , and hence effectively bosonic in nature , has been used for some time .",
    "this approach has been pioneered by wegner @xcite , who showed that , for noninteracting electrons , the effective field theory takes the form of a nonlinear sigma model .",
    "this was generalized by finkelstein @xcite to the case of interacting electrons .",
    "the key idea underlying these effective theories is to keep explicitly only those degrees of freedom that are likely to be relevant for the problem under consideration , and to integrate out all others in some simple approximation .    in this paper",
    "we show how field theoretic and rg methods can be used to describe the disordered fermion problem . in particular we",
    "first review how finkelstein s theory can be derived from a microscopic model with the aid of rg ideas . to this end",
    "we introduce the notion of a disordered fermi - liquid fixed point ( fp ) , and show that corrections to scaling near this fp give what are commonly called weak - localization effects .",
    "we then discuss various instabilities of the disordered fermi - liquid fixed point .",
    "physically , these instabilities indicate phase transitions from the disordered fermi - liquid phase to various magnetic and superconducting metallic phases , as well as to magnetic and nonmagnetic insulator phases .",
    "since the description of fermions involves anticommuting variables , any field - theory description for electrons must be formulated in terms of anticommuting or grassmann variables @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we consider here a model for a homogeneous electron fluid subject to a random potential that models the quenched disorder .",

    "the important physics on the longest length and times scales is controlled by two - particle excitations that are soft either because they are related to conserved quantities or because of a mechanism related to goldstone s theorem . for a detailed discussion of this point",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "it turns out that of all the excitations whose interactions are described by @xmath17 , the dominant soft modes are those that involve fluctuations of either the particle number density @xmath18 , or the spin density @xmath19 , or density fluctuations in the cooper channel , @xmath20 . in fourier space , @xmath21 , with @xmath22 a matsubara frequency , these densities can be easily written in terms of fermion variables .",
    "the interaction , @xmath17 , can be written in terms of these fluctuations as , @xmath23 with singlet , triplet , and cooper channel terms denoting interactions between the densities discussed above , @xmath24 @xmath25 here @xmath26 , @xmath27 , are interaction amplitudes in the particle - hole spin - singlet and triplet , and in the particle - particle or cooper spin - singlet interactions channels , respectively .",
    "notice that there is no cooper spin - triplet interaction term .",
    "the reason is that for models with static , point - like , interaction amplitudes , as we have assumed here , such a term is forbidden by the pauli principle .",
    "we will come back to this in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : iii.b.2 ] below .",
    "the idea behind the nonlinear sigma model description of disordered electron systems is that the long - distance ( long - wavelength ) and long - time ( low - frequency ) properties of the system are determined by the massless modes or excitations .",
    "the derivation of an effective theory then becomes a two - step process .",
    "first , the massless modes in the system need to be identified .",
    "for example , in a simple fermi liquid with no long - range magnetic order , the only soft modes are diffusive modes representing , e.g. , number density , energy density , and spin density diffusion .",

    "all of this can be done , and has been discussed in great detail in ref .",

    "the effective action given above is the generalized nonlinear sigma model that was first proposed by finkelstein @xcite as a model for disordered interacting electrons near a metal - insulator transition .",
    "insight into a disordered metal can be gained from studying the rg and fixed point properties of the generalized sigma model field theory given by eq .",

    "all terms that were neglected in deriving the sigma model can be shown to be even more irrelevant than the ones considered here .",
    "we conclude that eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.14 ] ) is a fp action and that any of the leading irrelevant operators ( which we collectively denote by @xmath63 ) have dimension @xmath64=-(d-2)$ ] .",
    "we can use these results to discuss the leading corrections to scaling near the disordered fermi - liquid fp for physical quantities such as the conductivity , the specific heat , and various susceptibilities .",
    "let us first consider the dynamical conductivity @xmath65 .",
    "its bare value is proportional to @xmath66 , and according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.15 ] ) its scale dimension is zero .",
    "we therefore have the scaling law @xmath67 where b is an arbitrary rg scale factor . by putting @xmath68 , and using @xmath69 , eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.13 ] ) , as well as the fact that @xmath70 is an analytic function of x , we find that the conductivity has a singularity at zero frequency , or a long time tail , of the form @xmath71 this nonanalyticity is well known from perturbation theory for both noninteracting and interacting electrons @xcite .",
    "note that these results were derived basically without doing any calculations , illustrating the power of the rg .",
    "the rg derivation also proves that the @xmath72 is the _ exact _ leading nonanalytic behavior .",
    "similarly , the low - frequency ( or low - temperature , or small - wavenumber ) behavior of other physical quantities can be obtained .",
    "for example , the single - particle density of states behaves as @xmath73 and , as a function of wavenumber , the static spin susceptibility scales as @xmath74 here we have omitted the prefactors of the nonanalyticities .",
    "in addition to the stable fermi - liquid fp discussed in the previous subsection , there also is a critical fp that describes a metal - insulator transition .",
    "this is the fp first discussed by finkelstein @xcite , and later analyzed in greater detail by others . for lack of space we can not discuss this here , and refer the reader to the reviews @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the fermi - liquid fp discussed in sec .  [ sec : ii ] , and the phase it describes , are perturbatively stable for weak interactions . however ,",
    "if the electron - electron interaction in some channel becomes large , the fermi - liquid fp becomes unstable , and the system undergoes a transition to a different phase .",
    "we will be concerned with magnetic and superconducting phases .",
    "the properties of quantum phase transitions to magnetic phases are discussed elsewhere in these proceedings @xcite . however , before we turn to superconducting instabilities , we will discuss some soft - mode induced properties of itinerant ferromagnets that are akin to the weak - localization effects discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] above .",
    "an important manifestation of quantum long - range order in a ferromagnet is the existence of spin waves . in conventional heisenberg ferromagnets",
    "the damping of the spin waves is negligible , and in the long - wavelength limit the spin - wave dispersion is @xmath75 the coefficient @xmath76 depends on the dimensionless magnetization @xmath13 . in the conventional theory for clean ` weak ' ferromagnets @xcite , @xmath77 , with @xmath78 a constant . in general",
    "this result is not correct for itinerant ferromagnets , because the same effects that lead to the weak - localization nonanalyticities discussed above also lead to a nonanalytic dependence of @xmath76 on @xmath13 at @xmath79 .    to see this we use a scaling argument . for more details , as well as explicit calculations ,",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "first we note that the coefficient @xmath80 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.1 ] ) can be related to @xmath13 times the coefficient of the @xmath81 term in the wavenumber expansion of a spin susceptibility . in the paramagnetic state ,",
    "( [ eq:2.21 ] ) shows that the leading small wavenumber term is actually @xmath82 .",
    "( here we consider disordered systems , we will come back to the clean case later . ) in the ferromagnetic state , on the other hand , the small wavenumber singularity is cut off by the magnetization @xmath13 . in particular , a finite magnetization acts like a magnetic field in this respect and supplies a frequency scale that is proportional to @xmath13 ( viz . , the cyclotron frequency ) . for diffusive dynamics",
    ", the wavenumber scales like the square root of the frequency .",
    "this implies a length scale cutoff , @xmath83 , due to the magnetization , that scales as @xmath84 .",
    "the net result is that for disordered systems , for @xmath85 , @xmath76 behaves as @xmath86 this leads to the striking experimental prediction that in bulk systems , @xmath87 compared to the linear @xmath13-dependence predicted by conventional theories .",
    "the net result is that the ` speed ' of spin waves in ` weak ' ( @xmath88 ) ferromagnets is larger than the conventional theory predicts .",
    "for clean itinerant ferromagnets a similar , albeit weaker , effect has been predicted @xcite . for bulk systems , @xmath89 , while in two - dimensions , @xmath90 .",
    "a large interaction in the cooper channel triggers an instability of the fermi liquid in favor of a superconducting state .",
    "we first discuss the phase transition to a conventional ( bcs ) superconducting state at zero temperature .",
    "then we discuss how disorder can lead to more exotic types superconductivity , especially in @xmath61 .      the standard starting point to describe any phase transition is to construct a landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) functional for the order parameter fluctuations .",
    "the basic idea is that these fluctuations are the important ones to describe the large scale changes associated with the phase transition . in a disordered metal",
    "the situation is more complicated because , in addition to the order parameter fluctuations being soft , the diffusive modes discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] are also soft , and in general they couple to the order parameter fluctuations .",
    "the usual procedure of integrating out all modes other than the order parameter fluctuations therefore in particular integrates out some soft modes , which leads to a nonlocal lgw theory .",
    "nevertheless , the critical behavior of the resulting theory can still be determined using rg ideas .",
    "furthermore , since the nonlocality of the lgw functional corresponds to a long - ranged effective interaction between the order parameter fluctuations , the critical behavior can be determined _ exactly _ from a gaussian fp , as has been explained in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to illustrate this",
    ", we denote the lgw functional by @xmath91 and the superconducting order parameter by @xmath92 .",
    "gauge invariance implies that only even powers of @xmath92 appear in @xmath91 .",
    "the coefficients in this expansion , i.e. , the vertex functions of the effective field theory , are connected correlation functions of the anomalous or cooper channel density @xmath20 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.6b ] ) , in a system away from any phase transition point @xcite .",
    "this auxiliary system we will refer to as a reference ensemble . in particular , the gaussian vertex is determined by the anomalous density - density correlation in the reference ensemble . denoting the latter by @xmath93 ,",
    "the gaussian term in the lgw functional is , @xmath94=\\int dq\\,\\psi ^{*}(q)\\left [ 1/\\left| \\gamma _",
    "c\\right| -c(q)\\right ] \\psi ( q)\\quad .",

    "however , since the reference ensemble is a disordered fermi liquid , its structure is known @xcite .",
    "rg arguments show that the structure of @xmath95 at low frequencies and long wavelengths in the limit @xmath96 is @xmath97 here @xmath98 is a frequency cutoff on the order of the debye frequency ( for phonon - mediated superconductivity ) , and @xmath99 is a repulsive interaction in the cooper channel that is generated in perturbation theory even if its bare value is zero .",
    "@xmath80 is the diffusion coefficient of the electrons in the reference system , @xmath100 is the renormalized value of @xmath101 ( see eq .",

    "( [ eq:4.3 ] ) , we read off the values of the exponents @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 , defined as @xmath109 and @xmath110 , with @xmath111 the relaxation time .",
    "they are @xmath112 by scaling @xmath113 with the correlation length @xmath114 , we also obtain the scaling behavior of the latter , @xmath115 the exponent @xmath116 as usually defined therefore does not exist , @xmath117 .    in order to determine how the order parameter behaves near the critical point , one needs the quartic term @xmath118 in the lgw functional .",
    "one finds that the exponent @xmath119 also does not exist , @xmath120 , but that the ratio @xmath121 is finite and is equal to the expected ( from scaling ) value @xmath122 finally , it is also possible to determine the behavior of the conductivity and specific heat near the quantum transition point . for these details",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite .      as mentioned after eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.6b ] ) , the pauli principle does not allow for a static , point - like interaction amplitude , @xmath123 , in the particle - particle spin - triplet channel .",
    "more generally , any point - like @xmath123 must be an odd function of frequency .",
    "in general , this means that if @xmath123 exists , then it vanishes at zero frequency , and is therefore not important at long times or low temperatures .",
    "this seems to preclude spin - triplet even - parity superconductivity triggered by @xmath123 .",
    "however , this argument is fallacious for low - dimensional disordered electron systems .",
    "the basic point is that in the presence of electronic interactions the diffusive modes that lead to weak - localization effects , and to nonlocal theories for magnetic and other superconducting phase transitions , also lead to a @xmath123 with a nonanalytic frequency dependence that approaches a discontinuity as @xmath124 . as a result ,",
    "the presence of both disorder and electron - electron interactions seem to inevitably _ lead _ to exotic superconductivity in @xmath61 !    to understand physically how this happens let us first consider the effect of the spin - triplet interaction amplitude in the _ particle - hole _ channel , @xmath125 . by means of @xmath125",
    ", an electron spin polarizes its environment .",
    "this polarization is ferromagnetic .",
    "suppose an electron has created a spin polarization cloud and then moves away . in a clean system",
    "the polarization cloud at a given point will decay quickly in time .",
    "the polarization cloud therefore essentially moves with the electron that creates it , giving rise to the standard fermi - liquid renormalization of the spin susceptibility .",
    "in a disordered system , a spin density fluctuation @xmath126 will decay algebraically like @xmath127 , because of the long - time tail effects already discussed ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.19 ] ) ) .",
    "the polarization cloud will therefore persist even after the electron that created it has diffused away .",
    "a second electron moving into the region at a later time will still see the remains of the polarization cloud .",
    "it will get attracted to it if the two electrons form a spin triplet .",
    "we therefore expect an attractive contribution of @xmath128 to @xmath123 .",
    "next consider the effect of the spin - singlet interaction , @xmath129 . by means of @xmath129 ,",
    "an electron charge polarizes its environment .",
    "again , while in a clean system this leads only to fermi - liquid renormalizations , in a disordered system the resulting charge polarization cloud will decay as @xmath130 .",
    "a second electron will be attracted to this region regardless of spin .",
    "the conclusion is that both @xmath125 and @xmath131 will lead to an attractive @xmath123 .",
    "further , since the fourier transform of @xmath132 is proportional to @xmath133 in @xmath61 , we expect these contributions to be singular at low frequencies , or low temperature .",
    "finally , since there is no bare repulsive @xmath134 to overcome , the conclusion is that in @xmath61 there is a tendency toward a novel type of superconductivity at @xmath135 .",
    "explicit calculations confirm the above physical picture @xcite .",
    "further , both the critical properties near this quantum phase transition and the physical properties of the novel superconducting state have been studied in some detail . for the phase transition properties we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to briefly discussing some interesting properties of the superconducting state .",
    "the first relevant question concerns the ( mean - field ) critical temperature for reasonable parameter values . as noted above , there are two mechanisms leading to superconductivity . for realistic mosfet parameters ,",
    "the charge fluctuation mechanism leads to @xmath136 . the spin fluctuation mechanism , on the other hand , can lead to a mean - field @xmath137 that is a fraction of the fermi temperature , i.e. , about @xmath138 .",
    "keeping in mind that mean - field estimates generally overestimate @xmath137 , we conclude that in at least some systems , this type of superconductivity is a possibility .",
    "other quantities of interest are the tunneling density of states , the diamagnetic susceptibility , and the conductivity .",
    "model calculations yield a density of states that vanishes logarithmically as the bias voltage approaches zero , so the predicted superconducting state has a pseudo - gap .",
    "calculations have also established that there is a conventional meissner effect , and that the electrical conductivity is identical in form to that in a conventional bcs superconductor .",
    "these results answer some questions that had been raised about the stability of odd - gap superconductivity . for details , see ref .",
    "our discussion so far implies that the nature of the ground state of a generic @xmath139-@xmath140 , interacting , disordered electron system is not known , and that there are a number of possibilities .",
    "indeed , this is one of the most fundamental open problems in quantum many - body physics , and we call it the two - dimensional ground state problem .    for noninteracting electrons , at zero magnetic field , the ground state is known to be an anderson insulator @xcite . when repulsive electron - electron interactions are added , a number of distinct possibilities arise .",
    "first , it could still be an insulator .",
    "indeed , this was the conventional view until very recently .",
    "second , the ground state could be the novel disorder - induced superconducting state discussed above .",
    "third , it has been known for some time that if there are no magnetic impurities or impurity spin orbit scattering , there is a tendency toward some type of magnetic state that may ( or may not ) be conducting @xcite .",
    "fourth , there have been speculations that some other , even more exotic , state may occur @xcite .    experimentally , the situation is very interesting .",
    "there is mounting evidence that in some @xmath139-@xmath140 systems , especially low - electron density mosfets , there is some kind of a conducting phase at very low temperatures @xcite .",
    "other @xmath139-@xmath140 systems are surely insulators . these observations are consistent with the notion that there are numerous possibilities for the @xmath139-@xmath140 ground state , and that the ultimate choice depends on microscopic details and can not be universally determined .",
    "a detailed free energy calculation will be needed to determine what ground state is the thermodynamically stable one for a specific system .",
