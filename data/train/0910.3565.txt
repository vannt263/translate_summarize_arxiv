    "this observation is the only one overlapping with the lat dataset and the peak flux of 1.05 jy / beam is consistent with the average over all the measurements ( @xmath50 jy / beam ) .",
    "an indication of the sensitivity of these data to detecting flaring core emission is that the high flux state observed in the detailed 43 ghz vlba monitoring at the time of tev flaring in 2008 ( * ? ? ?",

    "this only suggests a period of low activity in the radio core ( as reflected in the x - ray data ) , as the single radio flux may not be representative of the entire 10-month lat viewing period .",
    "in blazars , it is commonly believed that @xmath1-rays are produced in compact emission regions moving with relativistic bulk velocities in or near the parsec scale core in order to explain the observed rapid variability and to avoid catastrophic pair - production ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "consequently , it is natural to extend this supposition to radio galaxies @xcite which are believed to have jets oriented at systematically larger angles to our line of sight , thus constituting the parent population of blazars .",

    "a @xmath8 measurement of the sub - arcsecond scale x - ray nucleus also indicated a relatively higher flux than seen in past observations @xcite , thus signaling a common origin for the flaring emissions in the m87 nucleus .",

    "the fact that the 3 radio galaxies detected by the lat so far have amongst the brightest ( @xmath841 jy ) unresolved radio cores , in line with these expectations @xcite , lend evidence for a common connection between the @xmath1-ray and radio emitting zones in such jets .",
    "it should be emphasized that these observations are not simultaneous and particularly , the tev emission is known to be variable on year timescales , so other emission components may contribute to the variable emission .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a more complex case .",
    "this knot is more compact than knot a , and its ic emission is expected to be further enhanced by the increased energy densities of the surrounding circumnuclear and galactic photon fields , as well of the comoving synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "the radio / optical / x - ray fluxes of hst-1 have been declining since its giant flare peaked in 2005 @xcite , with current x - ray fluxes comparable to its pre - flare levels in 2002 .",
    "considering the variable and compact nature of the source ( with observed months doubling timescales implying @xmath87 mpc ; cf .",

    "its possible role in the production of the lat observed mev / gev emission is unclear",

    "other examples , including the few possible associations with egret detections like , ngc  6251 @xcite and 3c  111 @xcite await confirmation with the lat , and more radio galaxies are expected to be detected at lower fluxes .",
