    "there is only one genuine cepheid variable in _ kepler _ field : v1154  cyg ( kic  7548061 ) .",
    "it has a mean v brightness of @xmath09.1  mag and a pulsation period of @xmath04.925  d. its brightness variation was discovered by @xcite .",
    "further multicolor photoelectric and ccd photometric observations were published by @xcite , while radial velocity data were published by @xcite .",
    "detailed spectroscopic analysis was performed by @xcite and @xcite who determined the basic atmospheric parameters .",
    "@xcite has derived the radius and distance using baade - wesselink technique as @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "although v1154  cyg was already observed from space by the _ hipparcos _ satellite @xcite and omc onboard _ integral _ , the accuracy of these observations is behind compared to the _ kepler _ photometry .",
    "the first results based on the first four quarters of _ kepler _ data were published by @xcite who found v1154  cyg to be single periodic .",
    "the frequency analysis did not reveal any additional pulsation frequency while the period remained stable during the last 40 years .",
    "@xcite analysed 600 days of _ kepler _ data .",
    "the data revealed cycle - to - cycle fluctuations in the pulsation period , indicating that classical cepheids may not be as accurate astrophysical clocks as commonly believed . a very slight correlation between the individual fourier parameters and the o ",
    "c values was found , suggesting that the o  c variations might be due to the instability of the light - curve shape .",
    "this period jitter in v1154  cyg represents a serious limitation in the search for binary companions as the astrophysical noise can easily hide the signal of the light - time effect .",
    "later , @xcite also studied the light curve stability of rt aur , a fundamental mode and sz  tau , an overtone mode cepheid based on _ most _ data .",
    "they found cycle - to - cycle light curve variation of sz  tau and argued that it is the instability in the pulsation cycle and also a characteristic of the o  c curves of overtone pulsators whose oscillation seems to be less stable than that of the fundamental mode pulsator at both long and short timescales .",
    "the latest study of v1154  cyg was performed by @xcite using the 4 years of long cadence _",
    "kepler _ data and studied the light curve by using fourier decomposition technique .",
    "they found that the fourier parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( see in sect .",
    "[ foupars ] ) show modulation with a period of 158.2  d. they concluded that this modulation of the light curve is very similar to the phenomenon of the blazhko effect in rr  lyrae stars .    in this paper",
    ", we present the analysis of v1154  cyg using the whole _ kepler _",
    "dataset spanning 1460 d of continuous observations . in sect .",
    "[ data ] , we briefly describe the data used and details of the pixel - level photometry . in section  [ lcsection ]",
    "we present the results of the fourier analysis and the fourier decomposition of the light curve , while the construction of the o  c diagram is shown section  [ oc ] .",
    "we combined our new radial velocities ( rvs ) and previous rv data in section  [ newrv ] . in section  [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss the detection of granulation noise , its properties and the origin of the frequency modulation . in sect .",
    "[ summary ] we summarize our results .",
    "the photometric data we use in our analysis were obtained by the _ kepler _ space telescope .",
    "the telescope was launched in march 2009 and designed to detect transits of earth - like planets . a detailed technical description of the _ kepler _ mission can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the _ kepler _ space telescope originally observed a 105 square degree area of the sky in the constellations cygnus and lyra , and has two observational modes , sampling data either in every 58.9  s ( short - cadence whose characteristics was analysed by @xcite ) or 29.4  min ( long - cadence , hereafter lc ) , providing quasi - continuous time series for hundreds of thousands of stars .",
    "cyg was observed in lc mode during the entire mission ( q0q17 ) spanning 1470 days .",
    "data obtained during q0 ( covering 10 days altogether ) have been omitted because an unidentified timing error would have falsified the results , truncating the useful data set to 1460 d. the star was also observed in short cadence ( sc ) mode in 8 quarters ( q1 , q5 , q6 , q13q17 ) .",
    "we note that we use magnitude scale in the analyses in sections  [ lcsection ] and  [ oc ] because it is commonly used in the study of the classical variables like cepheids .",
    "however , we use flux scale in section  [ discussion ] because it is generally used in studying solar - like oscillations .",
    "we applied our `` tailor - made '' aperture photometry to the 4 year long _ kepler _ pixel data .",
    "this method already proved to be useful in the _ kepler _ rr  lyrae data processing @xcite and it is described in detail in those works . briefly , we check the flux variations for the individual pixels separately , and include all that contain the stellar signal in the aperture for a given quarter .",
    "the apertures defined by the pixels that clearly contain the flux variation of the targets are typically larger than the pre - defined optimal apertures , and provide more precise light curves .",
    "thus we performed a detailed investigation of the flux variation curves in the individual pixels of the target pixel data and we found that the variability of v1154  cyg is dominant in all pixels in the pixel mask in each quarter .",
    "this implies a significant flux loss due to the tight mask , similar to the case of some rr  lyrae stars @xcite .",
    "the target pixel mask contains two other stars , one of which falls exactly in the charge blooming columns of v1154  cyg , therefore it is not possible to avoid contaminations .",
    "however , the other star , 2mass j19481541 + 4307203 , which is a variable , can be separated .",
    "we examined the effect of separating this second star carefully .",
    "we defined a tailor - made aperture for this star too , and we found that within this aperture the flux from v1154  cyg is a factor of ten larger than that of the examined star itself .",
    "we concluded that the removal of pixels containing 2mass j19481541 + 4307203 causes larger uncertainties in the data than its contamination .",
    "furthermore , the few mmag - level light variations of this star do not affect our analysis , and can not be responsible for any modulation detected in the light curve of v1154  cyg .",
    "therefore , we decided to include these pixels in the total aperture and use all the pixels of the target pixel mask .",
    "our quarter stitching and scaling method was identical to the technique of @xcite .",
    "the last step before the analysis was the de - trending process . instead of using a polynomial fit or moving average technique we found an alternative method to be more suitable .",
    "we calculated the mean of the upper and lower envelopes of the light curve and then subtracted it . a sample of the final light curve is presented in fig .  [ lc ] .",
    "having four years of continuous photometric data , it is possible to study the long term stability of the light curve .",
    "first , we performed the frequency analysis of the dataset , then we calculated the fourier parameters of each pulsation cycle to study changes in the light curve shape .",
    "the frequency content of the light curve of v1154  cyg was investigated with the standard fourier transform method by using period04 @xcite .",
    "least - squares fitting of the parameters was also included and the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath5 ) of each frequency was calculated following the method of @xcite .",
    "we detected 28 significant frequencies altogether , following the recipe of @xcite .",
    "the frequencies , amplitudes and phases are listed in table  [ fourtbl ] , while the frequency spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ foursp ] .",
    "the most striking peaks in the frequency spectrum are the main pulsation frequency at @xmath6 c / d and its harmonics up to the 11th order with very low amplitudes .",
    "we identified modulation of the main pulsation frequency and its second and third harmonics ( see last column in table  [ fourtbl ] ) with a modulation frequency of @xmath7  c / d ( corresponding to @xmath0 159  d ) .",
    "this periodic modulation was also detected in the fourier parameters ( sect .",
    "[ foupars ] ) and in the o ",
    "c diagram ( sect .",
    "[ oc ] ) .",
    "we also detected another modulation of the main pulsation frequency with @xmath8  c / d ( @xmath0 1160  d ) .",
    "we note that this modulation is relatively close to the length of the whole dataset , but it is definitely shorter by 300  days .",
    "future observations may reveal its true nature .     _",

    "@xmath9 is the main pulsation frequency .",
    "besides identifying the harmonics of @xmath9 , we also detected the modulation of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 with a period of 159  d and 1160  d , respectively .

    "values are plotted against the stellar radius , logarithm of surface gravity , mass and effective temperature , respectively .",
    "the blue line in the top plot is an extrapolation of the scaling based on the red giant data . ]",
    "figure [ gran_comp ] shows that the scaling between the derived effective granulation timescale , @xmath12 and log @xmath13 is acceptable for both stars : they fall close but somewhat above the extrapolated power law based on the red giant data .",
    "similar , but less tight scaling can be observed with the radius and mass as well .",
    "the effective temperature plot , on the other hand , is dominated by stellar evolution and it reproduces the positions of the stars in the hertzsprung - russell diagram instead .",
    "for v1154  cyg we have a reliable estimate for the granulation power ( @xmath14 ) too .",
    "the ratio of the two quantities , @xmath15 , is related to the variance of the intensity variations over the stellar surface .",
    "this ratio is @xmath16 for the cepheid but it is @xmath17 for red giants with similar log @xmath13 values ( see figure 5 by @xcite ) . the difference can be attributed to various factors , e.g. lower contrast between cool and dark regions , or smaller cell sizes , leading to stronger cancellation effect over the surface .",
    "the observations of _ kepler _ revealed that solar - like oscillations in red giant stars have larger amplitudes and lower characteristic frequencies as the mass and size of the stars increase @xcite . at",
    "first we searched for regular frequency spacings , a characteristic feature of the stochastically - driven oscillations , in the residual spectrum , but we found no significant patterns .",
    "then we calculated the approximate range of @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 , in the notation used for solar - like oscillations ) , the frequency and amplitude of maximum oscillation power for v1154  cyg , assuming a mass range of 48 m@xmath20 , based on the scaling relations of @xcite .",
    "for this cepheid , @xmath18 would be between 510 @xmath21hz , with an associated amplitude increasing from a minimum of 80 ppm to roughly 500 ppm , as the assumed @xmath18 decreases .",
    "however , after we removed the granulation noise from the residual fourier spectrum of v1154  cyg , the remaining signals are about a factor of 45 smaller than the expected oscillation amplitudes in the entire frequency range .",
    "the only discernible features between 510 @xmath21hz are the small excesses around the positions of the 3@xmath22 and 4@xmath22 frequency peaks .",
    "this result suggests that large - amplitude , coherent stellar pulsation suppresses or completely blocks solar like oscillations in cepheids .",
    "inhibition of regular oscillations was also observed in compact triple - star systems where tidally induced oscillations are excited instead @xcite .",
    "the remaining signals in the fourier - spectrum are the broad forests around the positions of the pulsation frequencies .",
    "forests of peaks indicate a non - coherent signal , therefore we fitted the positions of the first four harmonics from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , with lorentzian profiles added to the granulation noise ( figure  [ lorentz ] ) .",
    "the full width at half maximum values of the profiles indicates that the lifetime is @xmath24 d. the origin of these profiles is not completely clear : they could originate from the pulsation jitter , but the eddington - plakidis test conducted in the previous study of v1154  cyg indicate that the fluctuations average out on a longer time scale of 15 d @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that the signal originates from the interaction between granulation ( e.g. , convective motions ) and stellar pulsation .",
    "in this paper , we presented the analysis of the _ kepler _ field cepheid v1154  cyg using the whole available long and short cadence _ kepler _ photometry spanning 1460  d ( omitting data from q0 ) .",
    "for the analysis , we applied aperture photometry to the _ kepler _ pixel data .",
    "the main results are summarised as follows :    * the fourier analysis yielded 28 frequencies .",
    "the main pulsation frequency is at @xmath25  c / d .",
    "besides identifying the harmonics of @xmath9 , we also detected the modulations of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 with a period of @xmath0159  d and @xmath01160  d , respectively . * in order to study the light curve shape we calculated the fourier parameters of each pulsational cycle .",
    "we concluded that there is a periodic variations of the amplitude and each fourier quantity with an average period of @xmath0159  d. * besides the short term fluctuation of the o ",
    "c diagram ( which was first detected in @xcite ) , we detected some periodic variations with @xmath0159  d. * we identified the residual power at low frequencies as granulation noise , and determined its effective timescale to be @xmath26 d. the timescale agrees with the scalings with fundamental physical parameters observed in red giants quite well .",
    "* we did not detect any signs of solar - like oscillations , down to levels 45 times smaller than the expected oscillation amplitudes , suggesting that coherent pulsations suppress oscillations in cepheids . *",
    "we obtained new radial velocity data and compared them with previous data from @xcite and did not find any @xmath27-velocity change .",
    "the radial velocities also revealed that the @xmath0159  d modulation is not caused by the presence of a companion star .",
    "the findings presented in this paper offer tantalising clues about the intimate connection between pulsation and convection in cepheids .",
    "the presence of modulation , period jitter , and granulation , and the apparent lack of evanescent oscillations indicate that several questions still surround the internal behaviour of these stars .",
    "the maturation of multi - dimensional hydrodynamic models promise that theoretical studies will soon be able to tackle these problems @xcite . from the observational side , further examples for",
    "these effects will require long , continuous , high - precision measurements that space - based missions can provide .",
    "the _ tess _ mission will collect data for about one year in the continuous viewing zones ( cvz ) around the ecliptic poles @xcite .",
    "the southern cvz contains one bright cepheid , @xmath28 dor that could be subject of similar studies .",
    "however , we likely have to wait until the start of _ plato _ @xcite to target more cepheids and to match the unique capabilities the original _ kepler _ mission provided .",
