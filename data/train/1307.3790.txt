    "the discovery of a higgs boson at around 125 gev has been announced by the atlas and cms collaborations @xcite . up to now",
    ", the measurements of the higgs boson properties are in good agreement with the standard model ( sm ) predictions except for the enhanced diphoton rate @xmath11 reported by the atlas collaboration .",
    "the future precise measurements will further test the sm and allow for a probe for new physics like supersymmetry ( susy ) which is a promising framework to accommodate such a 125 gev higgs boson @xcite .",
    "therefore , the intensive studies of the higgs productions and decays are very important and urgent .    among the productions of the higgs boson at the lhc ,",
    "the pair production is a rare process but quite important since it can be used to measure the higgs self - couplings @xcite . on the experimental side ,",
    "the discovery potential of higgs pair signal at the lhc has been studied by analyzing the decay channels @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "recently , the jet substructure technique was applied to the higgs pair production in the boosted final states@xcite , such as @xmath13 @xcite , which was found to be powerful in observing the events at the 14 tev lhc with 600 fb@xmath14 integrated luminosity @xcite . on the theoretical side , in the sm",
    "the main pair production mechanism is found to be the gluon fusion @xmath2 via heavy quark loops @xcite .",
    "numerous studies have also been performed for higgs pair production in new physics models @xcite .",
    "note that although the bottom quark annilation @xmath15 has a much smaller rate than the gluon fusion process in the sm @xcite , it can be significantly enhanced via the enlarged @xmath5 coupling in new physics models like the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we revisit the higgs pair production in susy for two reasons .",
    "one is that the sizable susy - qcd correction must be considered for @xmath15 , which has been presented in the mssm but not in the nmssm @xcite .",
    "the other is that the studies should be updated by using the latest experimental constraints including the recent lhc higgs data , the lhcb @xmath16 data and the planck dark matter relic density .",
    "it is also notable that the masses of the third generation sparticles involved in the susy - qcd correction to @xmath3 have been pushed up to a few hundred gev by the lhc direct searches @xcite .",
    "so the size of such a correction will be quite different from the previous results in the literature @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly review the higgs sectors in the mssm and nmssm and give a description of the analytic calculation of the susy - qcd correction .",
    "then in section iii we present the numerical results of higgs pair production at the lhc and discuss the susy - qcd residual effects in the heavy sparticle limit .",
    "finally , we draw the conclusion in section iv .",
    "in the mssm there are two complex higgs doublets , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which give rise to five physical higgs bosons : two cp - even ( @xmath19 ) , one cp - odd ( @xmath20 ) and a charged pair ( @xmath21 ) . due to the @xmath22 term appearing in the superpotential ,",
    "the mssm suffers from the @xmath22-problem . besides , in order to give a 125 gev sm - like higgs boson , large corrections to the higgs mass from heavy stops is needed , which will lead to the little fine tuning problem . to overcome these difficulties",
    ", we can go beyond the mssm .",
    "one alternative is the nmssm , which introduces a singlet higgs field . in the nmssm",
    "the @xmath22 term does not appear in the superpotential .",
    "instead , it is generated when the singlet higgs field develops a vev .",
    "also , the sm - like higgs boson gets an extra tree - level mass from the mixing with the singlet field and thus the stops are not necessarily heavy to push up the higgs mass , which alleviates the little fine - tuning problem@xcite . in the nmssm the singlet higgs field mixes with the other two doublet scalars .",
    "then the higgs sector contains seven higgs bosons , i.e. , compared with the five higgs bosons in the mssm , the nmssm contains one more cp - even and one more cp - odd higgs bosons . in the following @xmath23",
    "denote the real scalar components of @xmath24 in the mssm and @xmath25 denote the real scalar components of @xmath26 in the nmssm .",
    "@xmath27 is also used in our paper ( here @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the down - type , up - type and singlet higgs fields , respectively ) .",
    "one can get the mass eigenstates from the cp - even states : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and the @xmath33 is aligned by mass .",
    "the singlet contribution is reflected by the rotation matrix elements @xmath34 via the formula @xmath35 ( a large @xmath36 means that @xmath37 has a considerable singlet component ) .    in our calculations",
    ", we follow the simplified acot prescription to deal with the @xmath38-quark mass @xcite . by including the qcd and susy - qcd effects to the bottom yukawa couplings ,",
    "we can respectively obtain the effective @xmath39 couplings in the mssm @xcite and nmssm@xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41   ( i=1,2,3),\\label{deltab}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\delta_b=\\frac{2\\alpha_s}{3\\pi } m_{\\tilde g } \\mu \\tan\\beta i(m^2_{\\tilde b_1 } , m^2_{\\tilde b_2 } , m^2_{\\tilde g})\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\delta_b^{2}= -\\frac{2\\alpha_s}{3\\pi } m_{\\tilde g } a_b i(m^2_{\\tilde b_1 } , m^2_{\\tilde b_2 } , m^2_{\\tilde g}),\\delta_b^{1}=\\frac{\\delta_b}{1+\\delta_b^{2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here it should be noted that due to the contribution of the singlet field to the effective potential , an additional correction term @xmath42 appears in the nmssm .",
    "the @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the vevs of the higgs fields @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "the auxiliary function @xmath45 is defined as @xmath46 .",
    "the value of @xmath47 is related to the qcd-@xmath48 mass @xmath49 ( which is usually taken as an input parameter @xcite ) by @xmath50,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the number of active quark flavors and @xmath52 is taken as @xmath53 when @xmath54 , the evolution factor @xmath55 reads @xmath56,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57    since the @xmath58-related corrections have already been included into the tree - level contribution , we need the following counter terms to subtract them to avoid double counting in the one - loop calculations @xcite @xmath59    for susy - qcd corrections to @xmath15 , the sbottoms and gluino are involved in the loops .",
    "the sbottom mass matrix is given by @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 after diagonalizing eq.([sbottom ] ) , we can obtain the sbottom masses @xmath62 and the mixing angle @xmath63 : @xmath64,\\nonumber\\\\ \\tan2\\theta_{\\tilde{b } } & = & \\frac{2m_bx_b}{m_{{\\tilde b}_l}^2-m_{{\\tilde b}_r}^2 } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the feynman diagrams for one - loop susy - qcd corrections to @xmath65 has been represented in @xcite . to preserve supersymmetry",
    ", we adopt the dimension reduction method to regulate the uv divergences in the gluino and squark loops .",
    "then we use the on - shell renormalization scheme to remove these uv divergences .",
    "we use nmssmtools @xcite and looptools @xcite to perform a random scan over the parameter space and loop calculations . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume an universal parameter @xmath66 for the slepton sector and fix all irrelevant soft parameters for first two generation of the squark sector to be 1 tev . we also set @xmath67 and @xmath68 for the third generation of the squarks .",
    "besides , we impose the grand unification relation of the gaugino masses , @xmath69 , and treat @xmath70 as an input parameter .",
    "the parameter ranges in our scan are :    * for the mssm @xmath71 * for the nmssm @xmath72    in our scan we consider the following experimental constraints :    * the bounds for higgs boson from the lep , tevatron and lhc experiments and require the sm - like higgs mass to be in the range of 123 gev@xmath73 127 gev ; here we require the surviving samples to explain the observable at @xmath74 level which has an experimental central value . for the lep and tevatron limits ,",
    "the upper or lower bounds are implemented in our scan . for the lhc higgs search of @xmath75@xcite and @xmath76@xcite",
    ", we require the samples to satisfy the upper limits . * the constraints from the precision electroweak data @xcite and flavor physics at @xmath74 level ; * the dark matter relic density from plank at @xmath77 level and the limit of direct detection from xenon100 @xcite ; * the explanation of muon @xmath78 at @xmath74 level @xcite .",
    "= 5.5 in    in our scan , for each experimental data which has a central value , we require the samples to agree with the experimental data at @xmath74 level , except for the dark matter relic density which is required to agree with the measured value at @xmath77 level ( we made such a choice just in order to be consistent with the analysis in the literature ) . for the lep and tevatron direct search bounds on sparticle masses",
    ", we just require the samples to satisfy such bounds .",
    "for the lhc higgs search of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , we require the samples to satisfy the upper limits .",
    "the scan ranges of the parameters are large , we keep the samples survived various experimental constraints as stated above . besides , we further require gluino mass larger than 1 tev to avoid multi - jets search on susy@xcite",
    ". however , we did not impose other lhc direct limits on sparticles for the following reasons .",
    "first , we required the first and second generations of squarks to be 1 tev and the gluino beyond 1 tev .",
    "but the latest lhc search results gave more stringent constraints on such squark and gluino mass ( the most stringent bound is for the cmssm , which is @xmath79 tev in case of @xmath80 and @xmath81 tev in case of @xmath82 ) .",
    "actually , our results are not sensitive to these masses .",
    "second , the current lhc limit is about 500 - 600 gev for stop and 400 - 600 gev for sbottom@xcite .",
    "however , such limits were obtained in some simplified model or by assuming a certain decay branching ratio to be @xmath83 . in our case",
    "the stop and sbottom decays are quite complicated , which will weaken the lhc limits .",
    "further , for electroweak gauginos and sleptons , the current lhc limits will also be weakened in our case for the same reason .",
    "after that we also require surviving samples to avoid landau singularity at gut scale and we checked that all of our surviving samples satisfy @xmath84 in nmssm .",
    "we note that a large @xmath85 exist in the surviving samples of the mssm , this is because that a 125 gev neutral higgs mass is guaranteed by a large @xmath86 ( which provides @xmath87 close to @xmath88 ) even for @xmath85 as large as 40 . as for the flavor constraints",
    ", we projected our samples onto the @xmath85 versus the charged higgs mass plane and found that when @xmath85 increases the charged higgs mass grows dramatically ( especially , for @xmath85 close to 40 , the charged higgs mass is heavier than 700 gev ) and thus can satisfy the flavor constraints . for the samples surviving the above constraints ( i)-(iv ) , we further perform a fit by using the available higgs data at the lhc .",
    "we define the higgs signal strength @xmath89 as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the higgs boson production mode and @xmath92 stands for the measured channels by tevatron , atlas and cms collaborations . for each production mode @xmath91 , its contribution to the channel @xmath92",
    "can be determined by the selection efficiency @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "we summarize all experimental signal strength @xmath94 with their @xmath8 error - bars and selection efficiencies in fig.[fig : higgsdata ] .",
    "we can see that most measurement results are consistent with the sm predictions .",
    "the cms and atlas collaborations also reported their observations of the higgs mass @xmath95 @xcite : @xmath96 we use the combined higgs mass @xmath97 gev@xcite .",
    "the @xmath98 definition in our fit is @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 only denote the experimental errors .",
    "we use cteq6l1 and cteq6 m @xcite for the leading order and susy - qcd calculation , respectively .",
    "the renormalization scale @xmath102 and factorization scale @xmath103 basically can vary between @xmath104 and @xmath105 . in order to compare our results with @xcite where @xmath106 is assumed",
    ", we also made this assumption in our calculation .",
    "the input parameters of the sm are taken as @xcite @xmath107    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mssm1 ] , we display the parameter space satisfying the experimental constraints ( i - iv ) , showing the cross sections of the sm - like higgs pair productions via @xmath108 annihilation ( with susy qcd correction ) and gg fusion versus @xmath109 at the 14 tev lhc in mssm and nmssm . in this paper",
    "we aim to investigate the property of the @xmath65 production by including the susy qcd corrections . for the @xmath4 production ,",
    "we only calculate its cross section at one - loop level , not including the susy qcd corrections due to its small relative correction@xcite comparing the susy qcd correction on @xmath3 process .",
    "we used our own codes and combined them with looptools to do our calculation .",
    "we checked our results with [ 27 ] and found good agreement .",
    "we checked that our results agree with@xcite for @xmath3 and with @xcite for the gluon fusion process.we can see that due to the constraints from the lhc and b - physics , such as @xmath110 @xcite and @xmath111 @xcite , the values of @xmath112 must be larger than about 300 gev . in the mssm",
    "the maximal cross section can still reach 50 fb at 14 tev lhc , which can be competitive with @xmath4 .",
    "however , we also notice that the hadronic cross section proceeding through @xmath3 deceases when @xmath112 or @xmath85 becomes large . the reason can be understood as follows . on the one hand , for a moderate @xmath112",
    ", the dominant contribution to @xmath3 comes from the resonant production @xmath113 . with the increase of @xmath109 ,",
    "the mass of @xmath114 gets heavy and then the production rate of @xmath3 is suppressed .",
    "besides , the coupling of @xmath115 will approach to zero for a large @xmath112 and also leads to the reduction of the cross section . on the other hand , for a small @xmath85 , @xmath114 has a large branching ratio into a pair of higgses @xmath116@xcite , for a large @xmath85 , the production rate of @xmath117 can be enhanced but the branch ratio of @xmath118 is highly suppressed .",
    "so the total production rate of @xmath3 will become small.the decoupling behavior of the cross section proceeding through @xmath4 can be understood with the following considerations : to predict a 125 gev higgs boson , a large @xmath86 is required , which induces a sizable susy effect for the process @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath119 affects the process @xmath120 mainly through the higgs mass @xmath121 .",
    "so when we require @xmath121 in the range of 123 - 127 gev , the process @xmath4 is not sensitive to @xmath119 .",
    "further , since @xmath4 is dominated by the stop loops , the value of @xmath85 affects this process through the coupling @xmath122 . because this coupling is not sensitive to @xmath85 for our surviving points , our results depend weakly on @xmath85 .    in nmssm the sm - like higgs boson @xmath1 with mass around 125 gev",
    "can be either @xmath123 or @xmath124 .",
    "however , we focus on the @xmath125 scenario that is more welcomed by the naturalness . from fig.[fig : mssm1 ] we can see that the maximal cross section of @xmath3 can only reach about 4 fb , which is much smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "we find that the suppression of @xmath3 in nmssm mainly has two reasons .",
    "one is that in nmssm the @xmath85 value is around 3 - 5 which is much smaller than in mssm which is always larger than 10 .",
    "so the @xmath85 enhancement on @xmath39 coupling is not significant in nmssm .",
    "the other reason is the @xmath126 coupling is suppressed for most surviving points ( the main reason is the cancelation of different contributions ) .",
    "besides , in the nmssm the 125 gev higgs mass requires a small @xmath85 and a large @xmath127 .",
    "so the cross section of @xmath65 can hardly enhanced by @xmath85 .     in the mssm .",
    "here the samples satisfying the experimental constraints ( i - iv ) are further classified according to the higgs data : within @xmath8 ( red dots ) , outside @xmath8 but within @xmath74 ( green triangles).,width=548 ]    to further investigate the influence of the higgs data in fig.2 on the susy - qcd effect in @xmath3 , we define the relative susy - qcd correction @xmath128 as @xmath129 in our calculation we use the @xmath130 for the lo cross - section and @xmath131 for the nlo cross - sections , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mssm2 ] we show the dependence of @xmath128 for the @xmath3 on the susy parameters @xmath109 , @xmath85 , the lightest sbottom mass ( @xmath132 ) and gluino mass ( @xmath133 ) in the mssm . in this figure",
    "the samples satisfying the experimental constraints ( i - iv ) are further classified according to the higgs data : we use the @xmath98 and the degree of freedom to calculate the p - value for each point and plot the points whose p - values are larger than 0.045 ( 2@xmath134 ) and 0.318 ( 1@xmath134 ) .",
    "the degree of freedom is 15 [ 23(experimental observables)-8(free parameters ) ] for mssm and 12 [ 23(experimental observables)-11(free parameters ) ] for nmssm.from the upper panel we can see that a heavy @xmath112 ( @xmath135  gev ) and a moderate @xmath85 ( @xmath136 ) are favored by the higgs data and the susy - qcd correction can maximally reach about @xmath6 for the samples in @xmath8 range .",
    "similar to fig.[fig : mssm1 ] , @xmath128 decreases when @xmath112 becomes heavy . from the lower panel",
    "we note that for heavy @xmath132 and @xmath133 , the susy - qcd effects decouple slowly .",
    "this behavior is because that the susy - qcd corrections depend on the ratio of the susy parameters .",
    "for example , in the triangle diagrams , the susy - qcd correction to the vertex @xmath5 is proportional to @xmath137 and @xmath138@xcite .",
    "so only when all the sparticles and @xmath112 are heavy , the susy - qcd effect can completely decouple from the process of @xmath3 .    , but for the nmssm.,width=623 ]",
    "the relative susy - qcd corrections for the @xmath3 in the nmssm are presented in fig.[fig : nmssm1 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the maximal susy - qcd correction can reach @xmath7 for the samples in @xmath8 range . from the upper panel",
    "we can see that @xmath128 becomes small with the increase of @xmath127 or @xmath139 .",
    "the reason is that with the increase of the @xmath127 , the @xmath139 gets heavy and its contribution to the cross section becomes small . from the lower panel",
    "we see that , due to the residual effects of the sparticles , the susy - qcd corrections can still reach about @xmath140 for heavy sbottom and gluino .",
    "annihilation ( include the sqcd correction ) and @xmath141 fusion ( without the sqcd correction ) in mssm and nmssm.,width=548 ]    in fig.[fig : combine1 ] we show the total cross section of the higgs pair production at the 14 tev lhc ( via both @xmath108 annihilation and @xmath141 fusion ) for the samples in the @xmath8 and @xmath74 ranges of the higgs data .",
    "we can see that in the @xmath8 range the total cross section can be maximally enhanced by a factor of 2.7 and 2.2 in the mssm and nmssm , respectively .    finally ,",
    "considering the null results of the direct search for sparticles at the lhc , we investigate the susy - qcd effect in higgs pair production in the limit of heavy sparticles . for simplicity , we assume a common mass @xmath142 for all relevant susy mass parameters : @xmath143 . in fig.[fig :",
    "combine2 ] we display the ratio of @xmath144 .",
    "we can see that for @xmath145 tev , the ratios will maximally reach 3 and 2 in the mssm and nmssm , respectively .",
    "when @xmath142 goes up to 5 tev , the enhancements become weak but can still reach 1.8 and 1.4 in the mssm and nmssm , respectively .",
    "so the effects of heavy sparticles decouple quite slowly from the higgs pair production .",
    "we checked that the susy effects decouple quickly in @xmath15 but slowly in @xmath2 .",
    "annihilation ( include the sqcd correction ) and @xmath141 fusion ( without the sqcd correction ) in mssm and nmssm for heavy sparticle masses at 14 tev lhc . , width=548 ]",
    "we considered the current experimental constraints on the parameter space of the mssm and nmssm .",
    "then in the allowed parameter space we examined @xmath15 ( @xmath1 is the 125 gev sm - like higg boson ) with one - loop susy qcd correction and compared it with @xmath2 .",
    "we obtained the following observations : ( i ) for the mssm the production rate of @xmath3 ( with one - loop susy qcd correction ) can reach 50 fb and thus can be competitive with @xmath146 , while for the nmssm @xmath3 has a much smaller rate than @xmath4 due to the suppression of the @xmath5 coupling ; ( ii ) the susy - qcd correction to @xmath3 is sizable , which can reach @xmath6 for the mssm and @xmath7 for the nmssm within the @xmath8 region of the higgs data ; ( iii ) in the heavy susy limit ( all soft mass parameters become heavy ) , the susy effects decouple rather slowly from the higgs pair production , which , for @xmath9 tev and @xmath10 tev , can enhance the production rate by a factor of 1.5 and 1.3 for the mssm and nmssm , respectively .",
    "therefore , the higgs pair production may be helpful for unraveling the effects of heavy susy .",

    "<S> we consider the current experimental constraints on the parameter space of the mssm and nmssm . </S>",
    "<S> then in the allowed parameter space we examine the higgs pair production at the 14 tev lhc via @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the 125 gev sm - like higg boson ) with one - loop susy qcd correction and compare it with the production via @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the following observations : ( i ) for the mssm the production rate of @xmath3 can reach 50 fb and thus can be competitive with @xmath4 , while for the nmssm @xmath3 has a much smaller rate than @xmath4 due to the suppression of the @xmath5 coupling ; ( ii ) the susy - qcd correction to @xmath3 is sizable , which can reach @xmath6 for the mssm and @xmath7 for the nmssm within the @xmath8 region of the higgs data ; ( iii ) in the heavy susy limit ( all soft mass parameters become heavy ) , the susy effects decouple rather slowly from the higgs pair production ( especially the @xmath2 process ) , which , for @xmath9 tev and @xmath10 tev , can enhance the production rate by a factor of 1.5 and 1.3 for the mssm and nmssm , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> so , the higgs pair production may be helpful for unraveling the effects of heavy susy . </S>"
