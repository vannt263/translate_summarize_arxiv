    "quantum entanglement has given rise to much work in the condensed matter community as a new way to explore interesting aspects of physical systems .",
    "the kondo problem for instance has been revisited along these lines , with studies addressing the interplay between the impurity screening and the information shared between the impurity and the bath  @xcite .",
    "it is certainly reasonable to expect that entanglement  together with other quantities inspired by quantum information theory , such as the loschmidt echo or the work distribution  might shed new light on , and offer new experimental / numerical probes of , the key physical features of the kondo and other problems  @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting question in this direction is whether the kondo screening cloud  which has had so elusive an appearance in standard thermodynamic quantities  @xcite  might play a bigger role in quantum information aspects .",
    "other aspects of interest in the context of 2 level systems interacting with gapless excitations  generalizing the kondo problem  apply to the decoherence of qubits interacting with the environment  @xcite .",
    "a large part of the work combining entanglement and quantum impurities has been numerical so far . indeed , apart from the scale invariant situations , where conformal invariance techniques have led to spectacular progress  @xcite , the general situations involving crossover are very difficult to tackle .",
    "this is mostly because the entanglement is a different kind of quantity , not amenable to simple bethe ansatz calculations , for instance",
    ". there is , however , another reason for the relative lack of analytical results in this area : entanglement , being a zero temperature quantity , is naturally plagued by ir divergences , which make it non perturbative in the impurity strength . in that respect , it does behave somehow like some properties of the kondo screening cloud studied in  @xcite .    in order to clarify the main features of entanglement in the presence of impurities  in particular its scaling properties , and flow from small to strong coupling ",
    "we focus in this paper on a couple of representative situations , which we handle by a mix of analytical and numerical techniques .",
    "the lessons learned will be put to use in forthcoming papers , with applications of more direct physical interest .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : models ] we discuss the basic models we want to study , and define precisely the entanglement entropy . in section",
    "[ sec : uvpert ] we put together the perturbative calculation of the entanglement at small coupling , and show that it is plagued by strong ir divergences . in section  [ sec : irdiv ] we discuss this difficulty in a more general context . in section",
    "[ sec : smallcoup ] we show how the non perturbative nature of the entanglement entropy can be obtained using general conformal field theoretic arguments . in section  [ sec : largecoup ]",
    "we recall the principles of the large coupling expansion proposed in  @xcite and carried out to high order in  @xcite .",
    "when the dimension of the perturbation is @xmath1 , we develop in section  [ sec : ff ] the form - factor approach using the results of  @xcite , and obtain non perturbative approximations for the entanglement extrapolating all the way from the uv to the ir limit .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : numerics ] we compare our results with those of exact numerical calculations on large spin chains .",
    "the conclusion contains some last comments and prospect for future work .",
    "finally , appendix  [ sec : relsising ] contains a discussion of the equivalence between our impurity models when the dimension of the perturbation is @xmath1 to the boundary ising model with a boundary magnetic field at special values of the coupling .",
    "the main problem we study in this paper  though it has various , mathematically equivalent formulations , see below  is the calculation of the entanglement of a region of length @xmath0 centered on an ` impurity ' in an otherwise one dimensional , gapless quantum system .",
    "we characterize this entanglement by the von neumann entropy @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the reduced density matrix that has been formed by tracing over the degrees of freedom outside of the segment of length @xmath0 .",
    "an example of this setup is obtained by taking two semi infinite xxz chains coupled by a weak link : @xmath4 + \\sum_{1}^\\infty   j\\left[s_i^xs_{i+1}^x+s_i^ys_{i+1}^y+\\delta s_i^zs_{i+1}^z\\right]+j'\\left[s_0^xs_{1}^x+s_0^ys_{1}^y+\\delta s_0^zs_{1}^z\\right]\\label{firsth}.\\ ] ] the bulk chains are in a gapless luttinger liquid phase for @xmath5 .",
    "we shall consider the case of anisotropy @xmath6 , where the tunneling between the two half infinite chains is a relevant perturbation , and one observes healing at large scales . the case @xmath7 is exactly marginal .",
    "we parametrize @xmath8 , @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "we focus on the physics at energies much smaller than the band - width , where field theoretic results can be applied .",
    "consider then the entanglement of a region of length @xmath0 centered on the modified link .",
    "we can easily surmise what this entanglement will look like in the high and low energy limits from the existing literature .",
    "indeed , at high energy , the system is effectively cut in half . using the well known formula for the entropy of a region _ on the edge _ of a conformal invariant system we have @xmath10={1\\over 3}\\ln { 2l\\over \\epsilon}+s_1+\\ln g_{\\rm uv},\\ ] ] where we used that the central charge is unity , @xmath11 is a uv cutoff of the order of the lattice spacing @xmath12 , and @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the boundary entropy  @xcite associated with the conformal boundary condition corresponding to an open xxz spin chain .",
    "the remaining constant term @xmath15 is non - universal as it obviously depends on the definition of the cutoff @xmath11 .    on the other hand , at low energy ,",
    "healing has taken place , the system behaves just as one ordinary quantum spin chain , and the entropy obeys the general form for a region of length @xmath0 in the bulk of a conformal invariant system : @xmath16 here , we have allowed for a term @xmath17 , which can be thought of as a residual contribution of the weak link at low energy . in general , comparing entanglements for bulk and boundary theories is indeed difficult , since the dependency of the cutoff @xmath11 on the physical cutoff ( the lattice spacing in the spin chain @xmath12 , which is the same in both geometries ) is not universal , and not necessarily the same in the bulk and boundary cases .",
    "this important aspects is discussed in detail in @xcite , see in particular section 6.2.1 in that reference .",
    "the point for us is that the quantity @xmath18 is well defined , and its value @xmath19 can be easily obtained from the folded version of the system ( see eq .",
    "( [ hamilbdr ] ) below ) .",
    "more generally , since the bulk behavior of the entanglement entropy is not modified , it is natural to expect the existence of a scaling relation @xmath20 where the crossover scale , @xmath21 , is expected to be related to the coupling @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 should be a monotonic function extrapolating between @xmath24 at small values of the argument and @xmath25 at large values .    to proceed , and conveniently describe the field theory limit @xcite",
    ", we first observe that the problem , at low energy , can be turned into a purely chiral one . indeed , in the low energy limit , each half chain is equivalent to a combination of l and r moving excitations , and we formally map via a canonical transformation the l moving sector into a r moving one so as to have two chiral ` wires ' representing the two half chains .",
    "the additional tunneling between the two chains becomes , in this language , a hopping term between two chiral wires .",
    "bosonizing , forming odd and even combinations of the bosons for each wire , one finds that the odd combination decouples , while for the even one obtains the simple hamiltonian , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the conformal weight of the perturbation , and we have set the fermi velocity @xmath28 .",
    "the dimension of the perturbation being @xmath29^{-\\mu}$ ] , we see that @xmath30 .",
    "one can also fold back this problem into the boundary sine - gordon model ( bsg ) with hamiltonian @xmath31 + \\lambda \\cos{\\beta\\over 2}\\phi(0)\\label{hamilbdr}.\\ ] ] this shows equivalence to a large variety of other problems , including the one of tunneling between edge states in the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe )  @xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath32 is the filling fraction .",
    "the rg flows from neumann ( @xmath33 ) to dirichlet ( @xmath34 ) boundary conditions ( bc ) , and the boundary entropy associated with these conformally invariant bc satisfy @xmath35 , as claimed earlier .",
    "an interesting variant involves modifying two successive links on the chain : @xmath36 + \\sum_{1}^\\infty   j\\left[s_i^xs_{i+1}^x+s_i^ys_{i+1}^y+\\delta s_i^zs_{i+1}^z\\right]+\\nonumber\\\\ & + & j'\\left[s_{-1}^xs_{0}^x+s_{-1}^ys_{0}^y+\\delta s_{-1}^zs_{0}^z+s_0^xs_{1}^x+s_0^ys_{1}^y+\\delta s_0^zs_{1}^z\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is equivalent to tunneling through a resonant level at the origin .",
    "this time , the dimension of the tunneling operator is half what it is in the previous situation , @xmath22 is always relevant for @xmath5 , and the system is always healed at low energy . the same series of manipulations ",
    "` unfolding the two half chains ' , forming odd and even combinations , decoupling the odd one and bosonizing  lead to the hamiltonian formulation @xmath37,\\label{chiralk}\\ ] ] where we recall that @xmath38 ( * post - publication footnote added *  ) does not correspond to the xxz spin chain with two successive weak links as claimed here .",
    "the bosonization of the xxz chain with two weak - links leads instead to a field theory with _ two _ chiral bosons ( one for each half - chain ) tunneling through a spin-@xmath39 impurity .",
    "the dimension of the perturbation is also @xmath40 and the predictions of this paper can be applied to that case as well .",
    "the anisotropic kondo hamiltonian  ( [ chiralk ] ) can be realized on the lattice as an interacting resonant level model ( irlm ) , with two half - infinite chains of non - interacting fermions tunneling through a resonant level model with coulomb interactions on the dot only . in the xxz language",
    ", this corresponds to an xx spin chain with two weak links , with anisotropy @xmath41 on the two weak links .",
    "all the conclusions of this paper remain unchanged . ] ) . in this case",
    ", the dimension of the perturbation is @xmath40 ( note the factor @xmath42 compared with the first case ) .",
    "the problem can also be folded back into the anisotropic kondo problem @xmath43+\\lambda \\left[{\\mathrm e}^{i{\\beta\\over2\\sqrt{2}}\\phi(0)}s^-+{\\mathrm e}^{-i{\\beta\\over2\\sqrt{2}}\\phi(0)}s^+\\right].\\label{bdrk}\\ ] ] of particular interest is the case @xmath7 , @xmath44 which corresponds to free fermions . while the chain with one weak link is marginal , the chain with two weak links describes an interesting flow , and is in fact equivalent to a widely studied problem  that of the resonant level model ( rlm ) .",
    "indeed , fermionization in this case leads to @xmath45 where we have redefined the couplings @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "when going to the continuum limit , the @xmath48 site behaves like a two level impurity , and the hamiltonian reads @xmath49 { \\rm d } x+ \\int_{0}^\\infty i\\left[\\psi_{2l}^\\dagger\\partial_x\\psi_{2l}- \\psi_{2r}^\\dagger\\partial_x\\psi_{2r}\\right ] { \\rm d } x+ \\lambda \\left [ \\left(\\psi^\\dagger_{1}(0)+\\psi^\\dagger_2(0 ) \\right)d+ { \\rm h.c . }",
    "\\right],\\label{rlmferm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath50 , same for the second species , @xmath51 , corresponds here to @xmath52 in eq  ( [ eqrlmlattice ] ) . ] .",
    "in contrast with the case of the xx chain with a single defect , this non - interacting problem _ not scale invariant_. the coupling @xmath53 flows , and the system again exhibits _ healing _ : at low energy , the impurity level is completely hybridized with the two half chains .    let us go back to the general case @xmath54 . proceeding like before , we can write the limiting behaviors of the entanglement entropy . at low energy ,",
    "the impurity is hybridized , the system behaves just as _ one _ non chiral wire and a hybridized impurity , and the entropy obeys the general form for a region of length @xmath0 in the bulk of a conformal invariant system decoupled from the two baths , so @xmath55 where once again , we included a term @xmath56 that accounts for the remaining boundary condition at @xmath57 of the hybridized impurity .",
    "meanwhile , at high energy , the impurity is completely decoupled from the wires , and one gets @xmath10={1\\over 3}\\ln { 2l\\over \\epsilon}+s_1 + \\ln g_{\\rm uv}.\\ ] ] using the folded ( boundary ) version of the system  ( [ bdrk ] ) , one can easily argue that @xmath58 , as a decoupled impurity has two degrees of freedom .",
    "one thus expects a behavior entirely similar to  ( [ scaling ] ) , where the crossover scale , @xmath21 , is expected to be proportional to a power of the coupling square , @xmath59 , and @xmath23 should be a monotonic function extrapolating between @xmath60 at small values of the argument and @xmath25 at large values .",
    "finally , we note that in the boundary versions ( [ hamilbdr],[bdrk ] ) , the entanglement impurity we have discussed is now the entanglement of a region of length @xmath61 on the edge of the system with the rest .",
    "if one were to start from an ( anisotropic ) kondo version , this would be the most natural point of view  @xcite .",
    "there are of course other variants of the problem , for instance involving a slightly modified link in the antiferromagnetic xxz chain with @xmath62 , interactions in the rlm model , etc . in all these cases",
    ", we should stress that the geometry we are considering is probably not the most interesting : considering the entanglement of the two halves connected by a weak link or a quantum dot is probably more physical .",
    "this latter problem is however significantly more difficult technically",
    ". we will discuss it in our next paper , relying on the present work as a stepping stone .",
    "the most natural to explore the behavior of @xmath63 between the fixed points is to use perturbation theory .",
    "the required calculation is a modification of the one proposed in  @xcite . using the well - known replica trick",
    ", one first observes that the entanglement entropy @xmath64 can be obtained from the renyi entropies @xmath65 by considering @xmath66.the renyi entropies in turn can be obtained as @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the partition function on a @xmath69-sheeted riemann surface @xmath70 with the sheets joined at a cut corresponding to the segment of length @xmath0 .",
    "the difference between the problem at hand and the conformal case is that now there is a perturbation inserted at the origin in the hamiltonian formulation , which corresponds to the insertion of a perturbation along an imaginary time line for each of the @xmath69 sheets .",
    "the modified partition functions @xmath68 can in principle be expanded in powers of the coupling constant , and perturbative corrections to the renyi entropies and the entanglement entropies finally obtained .    to see what happens in more detail ,",
    "we consider first hamiltonian  ( [ hamil ] ) .",
    "we start with @xmath71 sheets , and write formally the renyi entropy as a functional integral for a pair of chiral bosons as @xmath72[{\\cal d}\\phi_2 ] \\exp\\left\\{-a[\\phi_1]-a[\\phi_2]- \\lambda\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\\left[v_1(x=0,y)+v_2(x=0,y)\\right]{\\rm d}y\\right\\}\\over \\left(\\int [ { \\cal d}\\phi]\\exp\\left\\{-a[\\phi]-\\lambda\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty   v(x=0,y){\\rm d}y\\right\\}\\right)^2}\\label{def},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the perturbation , and @xmath74 = \\int { \\rm d}^2 x \\mathcal{l } [ \\phi]$ ] is the free action .",
    "note we are working in the chiral version , but have suppressed the ` r ' label in the fields for simplicity of notation .",
    "finally , the label twist means the functional integral is evaluated with conditions around the cut @xmath75 if @xmath33 , the ratio ( [ def ] ) is nothing but the correlation function of an ( order two ) twist operator corresponding to  ( [ eqtwist ] ) , which we will write then  @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 means that the correlator is to be evaluated in the plane @xmath78 ( worldsheet ) with the lagrangian @xmath79 + { \\cal l } [ \\phi_2]$ ] .",
    "we also recall that in general , the scaling dimension of the twist operator @xmath80 reads @xmath81 .",
    "we now consider the perturbation expansion in powers of @xmath53 .",
    "for the denominator , we have immediately @xmath82\\ ] ] where the factor @xmath83 in the integral comes from the @xmath83 s in the cosines , and we recall that @xmath84 is the conformal weight @xmath85 of the perturbation .    for the numerator ,",
    "things are a little more complicated since we have two types of fields on the plane , with @xmath86 and @xmath87 contractions , in the presence of the glueing conditions along the cut .",
    "to proceed , we uniformize .",
    "we start with the complex coordinates @xmath88 , and introduce @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the complex coordinates of the cut s extremities .",
    "this maps the whole 2-sheeted riemann surface @xmath92 to the @xmath93-complex plane @xmath94 .",
    "we then write  ( [ def ] ) as @xmath95 where the spatial integrals in the numerator are now over @xmath92 ( worldsheet ) , and we have a unique boson @xmath96 instead of @xmath97 and @xmath98 . here",
    "the integrals in the numerator correspond to insertions along _ two _ lines , corresponding to the two copies of the theory , so overall there are four possible terms ( contractions ) .",
    "the perturbation @xmath99 is a primary operator , so we can calculate the correlations on @xmath92 by using the conformal mapping  ( [ eqconfmap ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath100 here , @xmath101 in ( [ firstorderuv ] ) we have to integrate @xmath102 both over the imaginary axis @xmath103 , but also over the second sheet , which is obtained by sending @xmath104 and same for @xmath105 .",
    "this means we end up with two integrals where @xmath102 are on the same sheet , and two where they are on different sheets .    replacing everything by the particular choice of coordinates , and expanding the denominator in ( [ firstorderuv ] ) we get @xmath106 + \\dots,\\ ] ] where the factor @xmath107 comes",
    "since there are two sheets , and insertions can be on same or different sheets , so @xmath108^{2\\mu}\\over ( y^2+l^2)^{\\mu/2}((y')^2+l^2)^{\\mu/2}}- \\frac{1}{|y - y'|^{2\\mu}},\\ ] ] while @xmath109 will be the same expression with a minus in the numerator s bracket , and no subtraction ( the two point function of the fields in different copies in the denominator of course vanish identically ) .",
    "it is convenient to introduce new variables via @xmath110 , so the integral becomes @xmath111 the second integral reads similarly @xmath112 both integrals are uv convergent for a relevant perturbation @xmath113 .",
    "they are however both ir divergent ( here the ir region being @xmath114 ) .",
    "this means that , although formally the perturbation at small coupling looks like it should be an expansion in powers of @xmath115 , this might actually not be the case and , as we shall see later , is not .",
    "in fact , we will see that the entanglement is simply non perturbative in @xmath116 , and can not be obtained via this perturbation theory .",
    "this result could appear as a surprise .",
    "on the one hand , the entanglement is a @xmath117 quantity , and such quantities are often plagued by ir divergences .",
    "on the other hand , we are looking for an @xmath61 dependent quantity , and it would be natural to expect that @xmath61 would act as an effective ir cutoff , rendering the perturbation expansion finite .",
    "this is however definitely not what happens .",
    "the situation is reminiscent of similar divergences encountered in the kondo screening cloud problem @xcite .",
    "we stress finally that the argument applies almost without modification to the hamiltonian ( [ chiralk ] ) .",
    "all that changes is that the perturbation is of the form @xmath118 instead of @xmath119 , so exponentials of opposite signs have to alternate in the imaginary time insertions , modifying some of the numerical coefficients , but not the integrals or their divergences .",
    "to gain a better understanding of the situation , it is useful to start by discussing another observable   than the entanglement entropy for ( [ hamil ] ) .",
    "we turn briefly to the boundary formulation ( [ hamilbdr ] ) , and consider the one point function @xmath120 which appears , for instance , in the determination of friedel oscillations for impurities in luttinger liquids .",
    "simple scaling arguments suggest the general form @xmath121 where @xmath122 is a universal function obeying @xmath123 , so the field sees dirichlet boundary conditions , and the bulk normalization has been chosen appropriately .    determining the function @xmath122 is also a difficult problem .",
    "the most natural is once again to attempt perturbation theory in @xmath53 .",
    "this would share many features of the calculation of one and two point functions in the bulk sine - gordon theory @xcite .",
    "there , it is well known that ( in fact , the result essentially goes back to coleman ) , provided @xmath124 ( that is , the perturbing operator is not irrelevant ) , there are _ no uv divergences _ in the calculation .",
    "all divergences coming from bringing together two insertions of the perturbing term @xmath125 are exactly canceled by similar divergences coming from the expansion of the denominator ( the partition function and associated bubble diagrams ) . in general , the divergences are indeed controlled by the operator product expansion ( ope ) , @xmath126 with all fields at @xmath57 , @xmath127 the coordinate along the boundary .",
    "the leading order comes from the contribution of the identity operator and leads to a disconnected piece subtracted off by a similar term in the denominator .",
    "the @xmath128 stand for higher orders , or lower orders that vanish after integration .",
    "the overall singularity at order @xmath129 thus behaves as @xmath130 , it comes with dimension @xmath131 and for @xmath132 the integrals are uv finite . other singularities ( when several points are brought together at once etc @xcite ) behave similarly .",
    "however , there will always appear ir divergences at a certain order , depending on the exact value of the conformal weight @xmath133 .",
    "of course , we expect in the end the scaling form to hold , and thus to depend only on @xmath134 , @xmath135 .",
    "what will happen in general is that the divergences in the perturbative expansion have to be resummed before the proper scaling form can be obtained .",
    "the latter , in general , will thus behave non perturbatively in the coupling @xmath53 .",
    "this is nicely illustrated in the case @xmath136 , where the the exact form of the one point function is known , thanks to a mapping to the boundary ising model ( see below ) , together with a very clever argument by chatterjee and zamolodchikov @xcite . one finds @xcite @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the degenerate hypergeometric function .",
    "the asymptotics follows from @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the usual modified bessel function , so that we find @xmath141 we thus see that this function exhibits a non perturbative dependence at small coupling @xmath53 .",
    "the non analyticity in @xmath53 arises from the ir divergence of the first perturbative integral .",
    "there is a general way to understand the non analyticity of course .",
    "whenever a bulk operator ( of conformal weights @xmath142 ) is sent to the boundary where it becomes a boundary field of weight @xmath143 , one has @xmath144 in our case , the cosine of the bulk field simply goes over to the cosine of the boundary field .",
    "we have thus @xmath145 and @xmath146 , while @xmath147=l^{-h_b}\\propto t_b^{h_b}\\propto\\lambda^{h_b/1-\\mu}$ ] .",
    "we thus expect that @xmath148 .",
    "the dependence of the one point function of the boundary field on @xmath53 is non analytic in @xmath53 , and non perturbative - of course , because again of ir divergences .",
    "this problem is the cousin of a similar problem in bulk massive theories , and has been studied in @xcite .",
    "we deduce from this that , to leading order , @xmath149 more generally , we can write @xmath150 so @xmath151 with @xmath152 @xmath153 going back to the case of friedel oscillations , we have therefore @xmath154 . this leading dependence in @xmath53",
    "replaces the expected perturbative one , which would be linear in @xmath53 .",
    "the foregoing argument applies in the generic case .",
    "whenever there are `` resonances '' and the parameter @xmath84 takes special rational values @xmath155 , extra logarithmic terms appear in the one point functions of the operators right on the boundary , which translates in logarithms in the one point functions of operators at @xmath156 as well .",
    "this is the case precisely when @xmath136 .",
    "it is important to stress also that the ir divergences naturally disappear at finite temperature , @xmath157 providing a natural cutoff .",
    "once again this is illustrated in the @xmath136 case , where one finds @xcite , for friedel oscillations at finite temperature @xmath158 here @xmath122 is the usual hypergeometric function , @xmath159 is a function whose existence and value were determined in @xcite .",
    "the right hand side admits a perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath53 , whose leading term , at fixed @xmath160 , goes as @xmath161 when @xmath162 .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath53 thus diverges in the zero temperature limit , in agreement with the fact that the true expansion is then in @xmath163 .",
    "the general ir behavior can easily be investigated .",
    "one finds that at order @xmath164 , there is no ir divergence provided @xmath165 . only when @xmath44  that is , the boundary perturbation is exactly marginal , and the bulk is a fermi liquid  are all orders finite . in this case , the friedel oscillations admit a perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "while the nature of the divergences is quite generic , the quantities for which they occur depend on the problem at hand .",
    "for instance , for the screening cloud in the ( anisotropic ) kondo model , divergences occur even when the boundary perturbation has dimension one - in that case , it is marginally relevant  @xcite .",
    "we now go back to the calculation of the entanglement entropy for hamiltonian  ( [ hamil ] ) .",
    "we see that , to obtain the non perturbative uv behavior , we must discuss twist fields and their opes .",
    "we follow the paper  @xcite but focus more directly on the question at hand .",
    "imagine we have a single interval for which we want to calculate the entanglement with the rest of the system , and introduce accordingly the @xmath69-sheeted riemann surface ( @xmath69 replicas ) @xmath70 . in the limit",
    "where the interval of length @xmath61 shrinks , we expect the presence of the two sewing points to decompose like an operator product expansion of the form @xmath166 where we allowed for fields inserted at points @xmath167 , the point @xmath93 on the @xmath168 sheet , and the set @xmath169 denotes a complete set of local fields for one copy of the cft .",
    "recall that the cut in the riemann surface @xmath70 corresponds to the insertion of twist fields in the complex plane , so that @xmath170 and  ( [ opetwist ] ) should be considered as the ope of these twist fields .",
    "what  ( [ opetwist ] ) means more precisely is that , if we have other operators inserted elsewhere , we can expect to have @xmath171 where @xmath172 designates operators inserted on the @xmath168 sheet , and @xmath173 is the @xmath168 copy of the complex plane .",
    "note indeed that the expectation on the right is taken in a fully factorized theory .",
    "restricting now to the @xmath174 that make an orthonormal basis ( so in particular they are all quasiprimary ) , and choosing @xmath175 shows that the structure constant @xmath176 will not vanish only if the average of @xmath177 on the riemann surface @xmath70 does not vanish .",
    "it is useful to make things concrete now , so for instance we see that there is no term with a single primary operator on the right hand side of  ( [ opetwist ] ) since the corresponding one point function on @xmath70 vanishes .",
    "there is , however , at least one term with a single operator , the stress energy tensor , since we know that @xmath178 .",
    "apart from this , the most important terms will be those involving the same primary operator on two different sheets @xmath179 , whose average on @xmath70 will be non zero in general . if the field @xmath138 has conformal weights @xmath180 , we will thus have that @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the conformal weight of the twist field .",
    "the crucial point is that @xmath183 involves _",
    "twice _ the scaling dimension of primary fields , in contrast with ordinary opes where only the scaling dimension would appear .",
    "the discussion carries over to the boundary case .",
    "one can , for instance , think of it after unfolding the system so as to keep only chiral fields as in  ( [ hamil ] ) .",
    "everything then formally goes through after setting @xmath184 .",
    "the question is then , what kind of fields @xmath185 ( the chiral part of @xmath138 ) can appear in the ope of two twist fields .",
    "the one copy bulk theory is a compact boson which allows for the fields @xmath186 on the boundary .",
    "this means that the radius is @xmath187 , and thus the bulk conformal weights are given by @xmath188 restricting to scalar operators we get @xmath189 or @xmath190 .",
    "for instance , the first values of @xmath191 correspond to fields @xmath192 , or , for the chiral part , @xmath193 .",
    "we now go back to the entropy calculation in the folded , non - chiral theory  ( [ hamilbdr ] ) . upon folding ,",
    "the chiral vertex operators @xmath194 become @xmath195 , as @xmath196 .",
    "recall also that the non - chiral twist field in the folded version can be thought of as the chiral part of @xmath197 in the unfolded theory .",
    "hence , going through the discussion of short distance expansions we find , for the non chiral twist field @xmath198 where we used the fact  @xcite that the two fields @xmath185 in the twist opes must belong to different copies .",
    "we are only interested in terms whose one point function acquires a non zero value in the presence of the perturbation .",
    "this means the first term with @xmath199 can not contribute , and thus we need @xmath200 , @xmath201 . taking derivative with respect to @xmath69 gives then the leading term for the entanglement correction , which should go as @xmath202 for @xmath136 in particular , this can be corrected by a resonance , and it is tempting to speculate then that one has @xmath203\\label{slog}\\ ] ] finally , we note once again that the rlm or the various ( anisotropic ) kondo versions will behave identically , the presence of the operators @xmath204 not modifying in any essential way the ope argument  but one will have to be careful with the dimensions of the operators involved , and their relationship with @xmath84 . in the end , we find that for the rlm  ( [ slog ] ) is expected to hold as well .",
    "while the small coupling expansion is plagued with ir divergences , a large coupling expansion is possible .",
    "it is now finite in the ir , and exhibits uv divergences which are easily taken care of using integrability and analyticity .",
    "let us recall how the calculation goes at leading order in the anisotropic kondo case  @xcite ( see also _",
    "the leading ir perturbation is nothing but the stress energy tensor @xmath205 the correction to the renyi entropy can therefore be expressed as @xmath206 the first correction to the entanglement entropy thus reads @xmath207 it is quite remarkable that this result does not depend on the anisotropy parameter @xmath208 ( recall that @xmath209 in the xxz language ) .",
    "it turns out that this ir expansion can be generalized to higher orders  @xcite .",
    "the results for the kondo case are as follows @xmath210 where the coefficient @xmath211 has the following dependence on the dimension @xmath212 of the tunneling operator @xmath213 note that in ( [ result : infinite : imp ] ) , the first term in the right hand side has to be truncated at order 6 .",
    "while in principle higher orders in the ir expansion could be determined , the complexity of the calculations increases considerably .",
    "moreover , the convergence properties of this expansion are not clear .",
    "finally , we observe that , in this point of view , the pure bsg case turns out to be quite different , because different operators appear in the ir effective description .",
    "the corresponding result has not even been worked out yet .",
    "making analytical progress therefore requires developing non perturbative approaches .",
    "the problems we are interested in are indeed integrable , at least in their boundary versions .",
    "while it is natural to expect that this can be used in some way , integrability has been mostly used to calculate local properties such as magnetization , energy or impurity entropies .",
    "von neumann entanglement is non local , and therefore much harder to obtain in general .",
    "we will in what follows restrict to the case where the dimension of the perturbation is @xmath1 : this corresponds to @xmath214 ( @xmath215 ) for the problem of tunneling between xxz chains , and to @xmath7  the rlm ( @xmath44 )  for the tunneling through an impurity .",
    "these cases are closely related to the boundary ising model with a boundary magnetic field ( see appendix  [ sec : relsising ] ) .",
    "while the problem of calculating the entanglement non perturbatively remains extremely difficult  entanglement still involving non local observables in the fermionic language  it can be tackled using the idea of form - factors .",
    "it has been known for many years that correlation functions of local observables in massive integrable theories can be calculated using the form - factors approach , where the integrable quasiparticles provide a basis of the hilbert space , and the form - factors ( ff )  that is , the matrix elements of the operators in that basis  can be obtained using an axiomatic approach based on the knowledge of the s matrix and the bootstrap . it is a natural idea to extend this approach to the case of entanglement entropy .",
    "indeed , the von neumann entanglement is obtained form the renyi entropy by taking an @xmath69 derivative at @xmath216 , and the renyi entropies can be considered formally as correlation functions of twist operators that live in @xmath69 copies of the theory of interest .",
    "the integrability of a single theory carries over to integrability of the @xmath69 copies , and a calculation similar to the one of ordinary correlators can be set up , after some additional work to determine the form factors of the twist operators @xmath217  @xcite .",
    "we are interested here in a variant where the bulk is massless .",
    "the form - factors technique in this case is more delicate to use , since particles can have arbitrarily low energies , and the convergence of the approach is not guaranteed .",
    "various regularization tricks have to be used in the calculation of local quantities ( eg the charge density for friedel oscillations ) @xcite , and we will see below that the situation for the entanglement is not better . nevertheless , @xmath63 can be calculated for @xmath1 , by using the ising model formulation , and relying heavily on the work  @xcite .    to fix ideas , and explore the feasibility of form - factors calculations in our problem , we first discuss briefly the bulk case and the massless limit .",
    "one can find in  @xcite the first order contribution to the two point function of the bulk ising model twist field in the bulk @xmath218 where @xmath69 is the number of copies , @xmath219 is the rapidity of the @xmath220 particle with energy @xmath221 and momentum @xmath222 , and @xmath223 is the two - particle form factor of the twist field @xmath224 @xmath225 in this last expression , we have used the notation @xmath226 for the usual faddeev - zamolodchikov creation operators ( here , the fermions ) living in the @xmath227 copy . since the theory is integrable , the form factors @xmath223 can be computed exactly and are conveniently expressed using the function @xmath228 which vanishes when @xmath216 .",
    "the other form factors @xmath223 can then be obtained from @xmath229 by shifting appropriately @xmath230 by a factor of @xmath231 .",
    "going to variables @xmath232 one can perform one integration , and be left with @xmath233 where @xmath234 doyon _ et al .",
    "_ then argue the crucial result that @xmath235 taking the derivative of the two point twist correlation function meanwhile should give , at short distances , the entanglement entropy of the cft . since ( [ firstorder ] ) is only a first order approximation where contributions with a larger number of particles have not been included , we get an approximation to the entanglement entropy of a segment of length @xmath236 in the bulk with the rest of the system  @xcite @xmath237 and thus the expected factor @xmath238 is approximated by @xmath239 at this order .    since in this paper we are interested in bulk cfts",
    ", we need to take an @xmath240 limit .",
    "this corresponds formally to describing the cft using massless particles and massless scattering .",
    "we thus set @xmath241 and send @xmath242 .",
    "only two types of excitations remain at finite energies : those for which @xmath243 with @xmath244 finite . in the first case ,",
    "one obtains right moving particles with @xmath245 and in the second case left moving particles with @xmath246 .",
    "conformal fields factorizing into left and right components are not expected to mix the l and r sectors .",
    "indeed , @xmath247 so only the ll and rr sectors will contribute in the massless limit of  ( [ firstorder ] ) . therefore , setting ( say for the r sector ) @xmath248 and introducing @xmath249 we obtain @xmath250 where the @xmath83 coming from the jacobian was canceled by the fact that there are two integrals , the l and the r one . using ( [ deriv ] ) we get the correction to the entanglement entropy as @xmath251 this integral is divergent at small energy , a feature which is quite general in the use of massless form - factors .",
    "we regularize by considering the integral @xmath252 so the finite part of the integral is @xmath253 and thus we recover @xmath254    let us now consider the ising model with a boundary magnetic field as in ( [ ising ] ) , and to start assume that the bulk is massive .",
    "the form factors approach can be applied to this case as well .",
    "the first non trivial contribution reads then  @xcite @xmath255 coming from the boundary state @xmath256 { \\left|0   \\right>},\\ ] ] where we recall that @xmath226 are the usual faddeev - zamolodchikov creation operators living in the @xmath227 copy , and @xmath257 is the reflection matrix  @xcite of the ising field theory with a boundary magnetic field @xmath258 ( proportional to @xmath53 in [ ising ] ) .",
    "ultimately , we want once again to take the massless limit @xmath259 .",
    "notice that ( [ firstord ] ) involves @xmath260 instead of @xmath261 .",
    "we write @xmath262 and observe that the analytical continuation in @xmath69 is trivial because the particle and its reflection must belong to the same copy . to every order , contributions are linear in @xmath122 .",
    "but there is a lot of similarity  eg between the term with four particles here , and the term with two particles in the bulk entropy . in the massless limit case , since the boundary produces as many l as r particles , and since we need both these numbers to be even , only the terms with @xmath263 r movers and @xmath263 l movers contribute .",
    "indeed , the first correction to the entanglement , after taking derivative with respect to @xmath69 at @xmath216 reads explicitly @xmath264 with @xmath265 . to obtain a scaling expression in the massless limit ,",
    "we boost rapidities like in the bulk case , and we obtain @xmath266 a vanishing result - natural , since in this limit , the two - particle form factor factorizes onto one particle form factors ( one for the left , one for the right ) , which both vanish .",
    "we thus need to go to the next order ( corresponding to 4 particles ) , where we use formula eq .",
    "( 3.25 ) in @xcite : @xmath267 we obtain then @xmath268 where we have set @xmath269 and we have shifted the @xmath244 integral .",
    "now the expression ( [ lowestorder ] ) is divergent at low energies , just like ( [ divint ] ) . to regularize it , we consider the difference : @xmath270 the uv value is @xmath271 , to be compared with the exact value @xmath272 .",

    "we have set @xmath275 .",
    "the second term is obtained by shifting the contours of integration in the imaginary direction as indicated .",

    "we now return to the rlm , whose results are obtained simply by multiplying those for ising by a factor of two . in the following , we will allow for an extra multiplicative renormalization to obtain the uv result exactly , that is consider , at lowest order , the ratio @xmath282      the next order approximation can be handled similarly , and we will simply provide the corresponding results on the curves below .        ]",
    "we plot our results for the ff approach on figure  [ ffir ] where the dashed line is the ir expansion ( see above and @xcite ) , and the full colored lines are form factors approximations .",
    "clearly , on this scale , the ( renormalized ) ff expansion has converged very quickly .",
    "we shall soon see how close it is to the real data from numerical simulations on the xx chain .",
    "we now discuss briefly the uv behavior .",
    "for @xmath277 , standard tables give @xmath288+\\ldots\\ ] ] where @xmath289 is the euler constant .",
    "this provides a leading order correction in the uv which reads @xmath290 .",
    "note that this is compatible with what was expected from the general discussion about the non perturbative behavior in the uv : we get a term linear in @xmath291 , decorated by logarithmic corrections .",
    "the next order is more difficult to handle analytically , but very accurate numerics shows that it does behave similarly , only leading to a correction of the slope which goes from @xmath292 to @xmath293 .",
    "we plot on figure  [ peter3 ] the leading correction divided by @xmath294 as a function of @xmath295 , together with numerical data that shall be discussed in the next section .",
    "we see that the ff expansion converges very well except in the uv , where it seems to still converge , but more slowly , giving us only a rough approximation of the exact leading singularity .",
    "finally , the results for the entanglement for the problem of weakly coupled xxz chains at @xmath214 would be identical but for an overall normalization by a factor @xmath83 .",
    "we now turn to a numerical determination of the entanglement entropy in the rlm , going back to the formulation  ( [ eqrlmlattice ] ) where we will now also have to be careful with the overall finite size of the system .",
    "we write @xmath296",
    "so the left and right leads have",
    "@xmath297 sites , and the impurity sits at site 0 .",
    "we can now switch to a representation of symmetric and antisymmetric combination of the lead sites , @xmath298 . since the antisymmetric combination decouples from the rest , its contribution to the impurity entanglement will drop out .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to study a system of @xmath299 sites @xmath300 here a single resonant level couples to a single chain of @xmath301 sites . in order",
    "to compare with field theory we use exactly half filled system to exploit the linear regime of the cosine band . in return",
    "we have to use an even number of @xmath302 sites .    the scale of the resonant level with a coupling of @xmath303 is @xmath304 with @xmath305 as we have chosen the normalization @xmath306 . following the recipe of @xcite",
    "we now calculate the reduced single particle matrix @xmath307 for the last @xmath308 sites , where the first site ( labeled @xmath25 ) corresponds to the impurity . in order to obtain the bulk result",
    "we determine the reduced density matrix @xmath309 for the first @xmath61 sites of the chain .",
    "the reason for taking the bulk result from the opposite end of the chain is that we can not just study a chain of @xmath297 sites , as we would then have a degenerate ground state as @xmath297 is odd .",
    "the diagonalization is performed within double precision , while the trace for the entropy is performed using quadruple ( 128 bit ) precision .",
    "the entanglement entropy corresponding to the single particle reduced density matrix is now given by @xmath310 which finally leads to @xmath311    in figure  [ peter1 ] we plot the numerical results together with the first three orders of the ir expansion and the first order of the ff expansion .",
    "we would like to remark that on the lattice we get small @xmath312 oscillations on top of the continuum result .    ) . ]",
    "figure  [ peter2 ] is a similar plot emphasizing the ir behavior .        finally , in figure  [ peter3 ]  as commented already  we focus on the singularity in the uv , comparing slopes obtained from the ff expansion .",
    "our numerics on system sizes @xmath313 is consistent with a singularity @xmath314 with a slope @xmath315 . by applying damped boundary conditions ( dbc )",
    "@xcite one can access very small energy scales on system sizes which are accessible by numerics . by looking at systems of @xmath316 sites where we scale down the bulk hopping elements by a factor of @xmath317 on each bond from site 2000 to 3000 and using a bulk hopping element of @xmath318 on the last 1000 sites we find an indication that the singularity is even slightly stronger . while we can exclude an @xmath319 behaviour , we can not rule out the possibility of an @xmath320 contribution .",
    "note that the dbc change the form of the density of states at the fermi surface , for details see @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible that this additional increase is due to this modification of the level spacing at the fermi surface . due to the slow increase of the logarithm such a clarification is asking for multi precision arithmetic .",
    "this study shows that the entanglement entropy of quantum impurities involved in an rg flow is a quantity which is difficult to access .",
    "it is non perturbative in the uv , and the ir perturbation , while well defined , does not capture the crossover regime very well .",
    "the form - factors approach , on the other hand , is remarkably successful .",
    "it is , however , difficult to develop except in the simple case of the ising model , and more work will have to be done in that direction .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the essential features of @xmath23 are under control , although it would be useful to check the uv singularities for other values of the coupling ( anisotropy ) .    in conclusion , we emphasize that the geometry considered in this paper where the interval for the entropy is centered on the impurity is probably not the most natural physically . to characterize the kondo physics , one would rather be interested in the entanglement of the two wires tunneling through an impurity .",
    "this could be characterized physically by the entropy of an interval with the impurity at its boundary , or for example , by the negativity of two intervals in the different wires ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for examples related to the kondo problem ) .",
    "this situation is unfortunately much more complicated technically , mostly because the folding procedures described in this paper no longer apply .",
    "however , we still expect the conclusions of this paper to hold in that case as well , namely , we expect the entanglement entropy ( or other entanglement estimators ) to depend non - pertubatively on the coupling to the impurity when this is weak .",
    "we believe that improper regularizations of the ir divergences encountered in perturbation theory led to some confusion in the literature  @xcite .",
