    "<S> we examine a single - pulse preparation of the uniform superpositional wave function , which includes all basis states , in a spin quantum computer . the effective energy spectrum and the errors generated by this pulse </S>",

    "<S> s algorithm , it is a superposition in the @xmath0-register for the modular exponentiation : @xmath1 . for grover s algorithm , it is a superposition of all possible entries of the unsorted data . in the language of computer science , the transformation of the ground state of the @xmath2-qubit register , @xmath3 into the uniform superposition of all possible basic states , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 is provided by the hadamard transformation @xcite . in physical systems , this transformation can be implemented , for example , using two different methods : 1 ) by a selected @xmath5-pulse excitation of each qubit , and 2 ) by non - selective excitation of all qubits using a single @xmath5-pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the first method could be used , for example , for a chain of spins connected by the ising interaction . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , in this case non - resonant effects disturb the uniform superposition . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that a @xmath5-pulse acts not only on the chosen resonant spin but also on all other spins @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> besides , this method requires the application of @xmath2 pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the second method requires only a single @xmath5-pulse . </S>",
    "<S> this method also can not provide a perfect uniform superposition ( 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second method is used currently in developed statistical ensemble quantum computation @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the second method . </S>",
    "<S> first we discuss the hamiltonian of the system , then the effective energy spectrum in the rotating reference frame and , finally , the error generated by a @xmath5-pulse . </S>",
    "<S> we present the results of numerical simulation of a chain which includes 10 spins . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in spite of the finite width of the energy spectrum bands , the amplitude and phase errors can be made acceptably small .    2 .  </S>",
    "<S> consider a chain of spin 1/2 nuclei described by the operators @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> assume that these spins have slightly different larmor frequencies , @xmath7 and are connected by ising interactions . </S>",
    "<S> in a liquid nmr quantum computation , one utilizes a statistical ensemble of such chains @xcite . to prepare a uniform superposition ( 2 ) , </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath5-pulse must be polarized along the @xmath8-axis of the rotating reference frame ( if initially the nuclear spins point in the positive @xmath9-direction ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of the system in the rotating frame is @xcite , @xmath10 - 2j \\sum_{k=0}^{l-2}i^z_ki^z_{k+1},\\eqno(3)\\ ] ] where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the amplitude of the pulse in the frequency units ( the rabi frequency ) , @xmath13 is the frequency of the pulse , and @xmath14 is the constant of the ising interaction . during the action of a @xmath15/2-pulse , the second term , @xmath16 , in the hamiltonian ( 3 ) is the main one , the two other terms are supposed to provide small corrections to the spin dynamics . to choose the values of parameters , </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the following inequalities are satisfied for our spin quantum computer , @xmath17 assuming @xmath18khz , @xmath19khz , @xmath20mhz , we shall consider values of @xmath21 up to @xmath22mhz .    </S>",
    "<S> 3 .  </S>",
    "<S> next , we shall discuss the effective energy spectrum described by the hamiltonian ( 3 ) . to understand the behavior of the energy spectrum , we first analyze a system containing two spins only . </S>",
    "<S> when the inhomogeneity and the ising interaction are absent , the energy spectrum consists of three lines : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the first level corresponds to the state , @xmath26 , where the index `` -y '' indicates that both spins point in the ( -y)-direction ( @xmath8-representation ) . </S>",
    "<S> the twice degenerate level , @xmath27 , corresponds to the states , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and the energy level @xmath30 , refers to the state @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider the effect of inhomogeneity when the ising interaction is absent . </S>",
    "<S> assume , for example , that @xmath32 and @xmath33 . then , the effective field for spin `` 1 '' in the frequency units is , @xmath34 the energy levels are given by the expressions , @xmath35 @xmath36 the main effect is the splitting of the central line into two lines with the energy separation , @xmath37 important fact is that this splitting decreases as @xmath38 as @xmath12 increases .    let us consider the error generated by a non - resonant spin . </S>",
    "<S> if the initial state of this spin is @xmath39 , then with linear accuracy , @xmath40 , the wave function of the spin , @xmath41 , can be written as , @xmath42|0\\rangle_z+\\sin(\\omega t/2)|1\\rangle_z.\\ ] ] after a @xmath5-pulse ( @xmath43 ) , we have : @xmath44 thus , in first order in @xmath45 , the inhomogeneity generates only a phase error which decreases as @xmath38 .    </S>",
    "<S> now , we consider the effect of the ising interaction when the inhomogeneity is absent . at first sight </S>",
    "<S> , the ising interaction produces an additional `` effective field '' in the @xmath9-direction , and its influence on the energy spectrum must also decrease as @xmath12 increases .    however , the `` effective field '' approach is not correct in this case . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy the check that the ground state is @xmath26 with a small admixture of the state @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> it has the energy , @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the central energy splits into two levels @xmath47 , which correspond to symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of the states @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and @xmath48 . when the rabi frequency , @xmath12 , increases , the influence of the ising interaction on the energy levels , @xmath49 and @xmath30 decreases . </S>",
    "<S> but the splitting between the central energy levels does not change as @xmath12 increases : @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> one might expect that this splitting will generate an error which does not decrease as @xmath12 increases . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , it does not happen . </S>",
    "<S> if both spins point initially in the positive @xmath9-direction , the wave function , @xmath41 , can be written as , @xmath51 @xmath52,\\ ] ] where we neglected the terms @xmath53 . at the end of the @xmath5-pulse , we have , @xmath54.\\ ] ]    for @xmath55 </S>",
    "<S> , we have a uniform superposition of the basis states ( in both @xmath8- and @xmath9-representations ) . for @xmath56 , to first order in @xmath57 , the ising interaction ( similar to the inhomogeneity ) generates only a phase error which decreases as @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the non - vanishing bandwidth , @xmath50 , does not cause a non - vanishing error . </S>",
    "<S> this happens because the phase error is proportional to the duration of a @xmath5-pulse which is proportional to @xmath38 .    </S>",
    "<S> 3 .  next , we present the results of numerical simulations with @xmath58 qubits . </S>",
    "<S> these simulations require operations on a digital computer in the hilbert space with dimension @xmath59 .    </S>",
    "<S> if the ising interaction and the inhomogeneity of the frequencies , @xmath7 , are both absent , the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian ( 3 ) consists of 11 equidistant levels separated by gaps with value @xmath12 . both the interaction and the inhomogeneity cause splitting of all inner levels . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to formation of energy bands .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] shows the energy spectrum as a function of @xmath12 , for the following values of parameters , @xmath60    the last equation means that the frequency @xmath13 of a @xmath5-pulse is equal to the average larmor frequency , @xmath61 . for each @xmath12 , there are 1024 energy levels . at the scale shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , each band is represented by a point .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , each band has a complicated structure . as an example , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1c ] shows the structure of a narrow strip of the central band as a function of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ bandnew ] ( left ) shows the dependence of the width of the central band , @xmath62 , on @xmath12 ( in the logarithmic scale ) . when the interaction between spins is absent ( circles in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ bandnew ] ) , @xmath62 decreases approximately as @xmath38 . a finite interaction ( crosses in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ bandnew ] ) changes this picture . </S>",
    "<S> after the width of the band caused by the inhomogeneity decreases to the value of approximately @xmath63 ( at @xmath64 ) , its value does not decrease . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence of @xmath62 on @xmath12 is qualitatively similar to the results discussed above for two spins . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ bandnew ] ( right ) shows similar dependence for the the width of the 4th band , @xmath65 .    </S>",
    "<S> now we consider the errors generated in the process of preparation of a uniform superposition of the basis states , @xmath66 .    in the rotating frame </S>",
    "<S> , the spin dynamics can be described as a superposition of stationary solutions with constant coefficients , which can be found from the initial conditions . in the absence of both </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between spins and the inhomogeneity , a @xmath5-pulse applied to the ground state , @xmath67 , generates a uniform superposition of all @xmath68 basic states with the amplitudes @xmath69 .    to describe the error in the complex amplitude , @xmath70 , of the state @xmath71 @xmath72 , </S>",
    "<S> we use two quantities : 1 ) @xmath73 which describes the error of the amplitude modulus , @xmath74 , and 2 ) the phase modulus , @xmath75 , which describes the phase error ( as @xmath76 in the ideal case ) . fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ ampli ] shows the dependences of the maximal error , @xmath77 and the average error , @xmath78 , on the rabi frequency , @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that both quantities decrease approximately as @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pha ] shows similar dependences of the phase error on @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> both , @xmath80 and @xmath81 decrease approximately as @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the results derived above for two spins . note that for parameters we chose ( which correspond to @xmath82 ) , the main contribution to the error depends on the inhomogeneity . </S>",
    "<S> the plots presented in figs [ ampli ] and [ pha ] do not change significantly when @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ camp ] shows the distribution of the complex amplitudes , @xmath83 , in the complex plane for @xmath84 and @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the distribution of @xmath83 has a form of the arc whose length and width decrease as @xmath12 increases .    </S>",
    "<S> 4 .  in this section , we note that the quantum hamiltonian ( 3 ) belongs to the so - called quantum non - integrable systems . </S>",
    "<S> this means that , treated classically , these systems exhibit chaotic behavior for some range of parameters and initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein . ) </S>",
    "<S> the quantum properties of classically chaotic systems can be investigated by a detailed analysis of their eigenvalues and eigenfunctions@xcite </S>",
    "<S> . this analysis will be the subject of future investigation . here , we concentrate on the statistics of neighboring energy levels spacing , @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed it has been conjectured that @xmath86 for a chaotic system depends only on some general symmetries@xcite . in our case </S>",
    "<S> ( for hermitian matrices ) , we can assume the quantum chaos regime as described by a wigner - dyson distribution . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pofs ] shows the transition of @xmath86 , from the poisson distribution to the wigner - dyson distribution of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) of hermitian matrices .    as one can see from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pofs ] , the transition to chaos appears for relatively large values of @xmath14 which are far beyond the range of quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> also , the appearance of the poisson distribution , which should be a fingerprint of integrability , appears at relatively high values of @xmath14 , out of quantum computation regime . </S>",
    "<S> level statistics in the quantum computation regime will be the subject of future investigations .    </S>",
    "<S> 5 .  in conclusion , we investigated the errors generated by a single - pulse implementation of the hadamard transformation for a chain of spins connected by the ising interaction . in the rotating reference frame , </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between spins and the inhomogeneity of the larmor frequencies split the energy levels into the bands . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic width of the band caused by the inhomogeneity decreases as @xmath38 as the rabi frequency , @xmath12 , increases . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution to the band widths due to the ising interaction between spins remains constant . in spite of this fact , errors generated in the process of preparation of the uniform wave function decrease monotonically as @xmath12 increases . </S>",
    "<S> when the rabi frequency , @xmath12 , increases , the errors of the amplitude modulus , @xmath74 , decrease as @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the phase errors decrease only as @xmath38 . for reasonable values of @xmath12 , </S>",
    "<S> the errors of the amplitude s modulus , @xmath74 , become negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the phase error can be reduced to the order of @xmath87rad . </S>",
    "<S> thus , both the errors caused by the inhomogeneity and the interaction between spins can be made reasonably small , for a single - pulse generation of the superpositional wave function used in the main quantum algorithms . </S>"
