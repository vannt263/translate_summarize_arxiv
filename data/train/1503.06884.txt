    "graphene is a two - dimensional material conformed by hexagonal rings of carbon atoms with unique physical properties , which make it a material of great scientific and technological interest .",
    "graphene shows an anomalous hall effect at room temperature , resulting from a linear dependence between the density of electric charge carriers and the voltage @xcite .",
    "an extraordinary feature of the electronic properties in graphene is the linear relation between energy and momentum of @xmath0 electrons at low energies ( less than @xmath1 ev ) , being different than the usual quadratic energy momentum relations in ordinary materials . that dispersion relation ( @xmath2 ) causes that the electron transport in graphene to be governed by a dirac - like hamiltonian , and electrons to behave like massless dirac fermions @xcite .",
    "the peculiar electronic properties of graphene have consequences on the landau levels ( lls ) spectra , which are defined as quantized energy states of charged particles in motion under a uniform applied magnetic field , @xmath3 @xcite . in an ordinary conductor ,",
    "the energy of the lls have a linear dependence with the quantization integer @xmath4 , as @xmath5 . however , in graphene the lls spectrum is quantized according to @xmath6 @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", many works have been devoted to find practical methods to control graphene s properties .",
    "a possible way to modulate the electronic , vibrational and transport properties is by performing a deformation on the graphene sample @xcite or bilayer graphene @xcite .",
    "thus , actual studies identify three main effects of uniaxial strain on low - energy band structure in graphene @xcite .",
    "first , a slipping of the dirac points out of the high symmetry points k and k. second , a distortion in the traversal section of the dirac cones , breaking the isotropy of the fermi velocity ; and third , a small vertical axis tilting of dirac cones , which could be negligible in most of the situations . considering that the lls in graphene only depend on the shape of dirac cone cross section , the second effect is expected to have more influence on the structure of lls spectra . as we show here",
    ", the tilting of dirac cone axis also has a non negligiable effect on lls for high strains ( 15 - 20% ) .",
    "some theoretical works use an anisotropic mass model to find the lls in graphene through topological considerations @xcite .",
    "another authors frequently analyze the properties of strained graphene using the tight - binding ( tb ) approximation , including the effect of deformation on the atomic distances through the scaling of the hopping parameters @xcite .",
    "this hopping renormalization is commonly modeled with an exponential decay @xcite or using the harrison s scaling rule @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "both renormalizations could fail beyond the linear elastic regime since the poisson ratio changes with the strain .",
    "indeed they could have a different dependence for each strain - type considered . an accurate and precise way to obtain the hopping parameters in strained graphene",
    "is through a fitting of the tb hamiltonian to the energy bands obtained from density functional theory ( dft ) calculations @xcite or from experimental data .    instead of a hopping renormalization , an alternative way is proposed in the present work .",
    "we use a renormalized linear momentum in an effective dirac - like hamiltonian .",
    "the coefficients of the linear momentum are related with the geometrical parameters of the distorted dirac cone , and can be calculated from a fitting to the energy bands obtained with a dft calculation .",
    "then , we apply a minimal substitution in the free - field effective dirac - like hamiltonian to get the lls spectra . in particular , for uniaxial strain we found that the lls spectra is contracted as a function of the deformation along the zig - zag ( zz ) and arm - chair ( ac ) directions .",
    "this contraction of the lls spectra is due to the renormalization of the fermi velocity with the strain , which is reduced by the stretching along these directions . in addition , we have evaluated the contribution of the tilting of dirac cone axis to the contraction of the lls in uniaxially deformed graphene",
    "to clarify our methodology , we show how to obtain the lls in unstrained pristine graphene from an effective dirac - like hamiltonian in a low energy and magnetic field regime .",
    "we treat the dynamics of an electron moving in a graphene sheet under a uniform magnetic field @xmath8 perpendicular to the direction of propagation .",
    "we consider the electrons in graphene as massless dirac fermions , having a linear dispersion relation @xmath9 @xcite . with @xmath10 ,",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath11 only depends on the linear momentum @xmath12 and can be represented by a 4 @xmath13 4 block diagonal matrix @xcite @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the fermi velocity and @xmath16 are the pauli matrices acting on the pseudo - spin space , which discriminate between the contribution of the two triangular sublattices present in graphene .",
    "each block in the hamiltonian represents the @xmath17 and @xmath18 valleys , coinciding with the high symmetry points in absence of strain . for @xmath19 , we do the minimal substitution @xmath20 in the free - field hamiltonian with the landau gauge @xmath21 @xcite . due to the @xmath22 conservation , the electron s wave - function in graphene can be expressed using variables separation , having the form @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are four - component vector functions with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , describing the pseudospin ( @xmath28 ) and the valley ( _ k _ or _",
    "k _ ) states ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we focus in the @xmath17 valley , substituting and in the dirac equation @xmath30 , we obtain @xmath31    with @xmath32 and @xmath33 . decoupling the system of equations and using the commutator @xmath34 = -i\\hbar eb$ ] , we get @xmath35    being similar to the quantum harmonic oscillator equation . therefore , for dirac electrons in the presence of a uniform perpendicular magnetic field , the lls spectra",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath36    with @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ,  and degeneracy of @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the sample area and @xmath42 is the magnetic flux quantum .",
    "the four - fold degeneracy of lls in deformed graphene @xmath43 is due to a two - fold pseudospin and a two - fold valley degeneracy . while that for @xmath37 , there is a two - fold degeneracy because the valley index is the same as the sublattice index .",
    "this result is different from the lls spectra for conventional conductors @xmath44 , where each level has a constant separation , while in graphene the lls separation decreases as @xmath45 increases .",
    "this behaviour has been confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that fitting the expression to the experimental spectrum , the value of @xmath15 can be obtained @xcite .",
    "it is known that the dirac cones lose their isotropy when graphene is under non - isotropic strain and consequently , the effective dirac hamiltonian of is not valid anymore . to overcome this problem and thinking in a general case , i.e. an inhomogeneous strain @xcite",
    ", we propose a renomalization in the linear momentum @xmath12 for the hamiltonian @xmath46    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are dimensionless functions . in pristine graphene ,",

    "for the @xmath18 valley , the same decoupled equation system is obtained with @xmath68 and @xmath69 instead of @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively , with superscripts @xmath72 in the @xmath73 operators and @xmath74 vector potential .",
    "the @xmath56 partial differential equation system is an alternative way to describe the electron dynamics in strained graphene with deformed dirac cones and in the presence of a nonuniform magnetic field from the anisotropy parameters with a spatial dependence . if we know the exact form of @xmath47 and @xmath48 from the dispersion relation or the fermi velocity , it is possible to obtain the lls solving the equation system .",
