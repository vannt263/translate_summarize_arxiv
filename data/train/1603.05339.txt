    "over the past two decades , color centers in diamond have emerged as promising systems for quantum information ( qi ) applications  @xcite and precision sensing  @xcite .",
    "they were the first and are still among the brightest solid - state , room - temperature single photon sources  @xcite .",
    "moreover , several defects allow for optical access to associated electron and nuclear spin states , which can exhibit long coherence times  @xcite , enabling their use as quantum memories  @xcite in qi applications  @xcite .",
    "these defects also exhibit strong sensitivity to magnetic field  @xcite , electric field  @xcite , strain  @xcite , pressure  @xcite , and temperature dependence  @xcite , enabling sensing of small fields at low frequencies  @xcite , often at room temperature  @xcite , and down to the single nuclear spin level  @xcite . by coupling these already promising defect centers to optical nano- and microstructures  @xcite",
    ", one can shape and control the optical properties to increase the performance , efficiency , and fidelity of sensing and qi protocols .",
    "recent demonstrations of a variety of diamond patterning techniques  focused ion beam ( fib ) milling  @xcite , reactive ion etching ( rie )  @xcite , quasi - isotropic etching  @xcite , and electron beam induced etching ( ebie )  @xcite  have enabled patterning of diamond at the nanoscale , and thus the field of diamond nanophotonics . with high quality diamond fabrication now a reality ,",
    "many optical systems have been proposed and realized in diamond and hybrid diamond systems . here , we will discuss photonic structures for increased collection efficiency , stand - alone defect - cavity systems for tailored light - matter interaction , and hybrid photonic architectures for photon collection , routing , interaction , and detection .",
    "we will particularly focus on diamond _ photonic _ structures coupled to single quantum systems , and not discuss diamond plasmonics  @xcite , non - linear photonics in diamond resonators  @xcite , raman - lasers  @xcite , optomechanical systems  @xcite , and hybrid systems with diamond nanocrystals  @xcite .",
    "while there have been significant advances with nanodiamonds in hybrid photonic systems , and nanodiamond fabrication and properties have advanced  @xcite , in this paper we will focus on diamond nano- and microstructures patterned into polycrystalline and single - crystal diamond , which have been shown to have superior optical and spin properties compared to most diamond nanocrystals .",
    "diamond s exceptional combination of a wide electronic bandgap , high mechanical strength , high thermal conductivity , and large hole mobility has made it an attractive material for high frequency , power , temperature , and voltage applications such as power electronics  @xcite . furthermore , diamond is chemically inert and biocompatible making it a promising material for biological applications , especially in nanocrystalline form  @xcite . in the field of quantum optics , diamond is uniquely attractive due to its wide bandgap , @xmath0  ev , which allows it to host to more than 500 optically active defects , known as ` color centers ' .",
    "these crystalline defects , corresponding to some combination of displacement or substitution of the native carbon atoms within the diamond lattice , create spatially localized , energetically separated ground and excited states within the electronic band gap of the bulk crystal .",
    "the high debye temperature of diamond ( @xmath1k  @xcite ) leads to a relatively low phonon population at room temperature , which allows these defect - related electronic states to persist for long times without suffering from phonon - induced relaxation .",
    "finally , diamond crystals are relatively free of nuclear spins , with a natural composition of @xmath2c of @xmath3 that can be increased to @xmath4 in isotopically - enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) growth  @xcite .",
    "this lack of background spins leads to low magnetic field fluctuations , in principal facilitating long coherence times for the few electronic or nuclear spins present .",
    "these properties make diamond an ideal host material for single quantum defects and photonic elements .      of the over 500 optically active defect centers in diamond  @xcite ,",
    "more than 10 have been demonstrated to exist as single quantum emitters  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : colorcenters1 ] , these centers span a wide range of single - photon emission wavelengths across the visible spectrum ranging from the blue into the near - infrared .    of these single - photon sources , three have been observed to exhibit optically detected magnetic resonance ( odmr ) , in which changes in photon emission intensity are observed while driving the spin on and off resonance with a tunable microwave field , first demonstrated for the negatively charged nitrogen vacancy center ( nv@xmath5 )  @xcite .",
    "this is a convenient mechanism for direct spin state readout via photoluminescence .",
    "spin - state - dependent optical transitions , in general , enable fast initialization , manipulation and measurement of spin states using laser excitation  @xcite .",
    "many quantum information processing ( qip ) schemes use a link between stationary solid - state quantum memory bits and flying photonic qubits as a basic resource  @xcite , making diamond spin systems an attractive candidate for qip  @xcite .",
    "the most prominent among the odmr - active diamond color centers is the nv@xmath5 , which exhibits stable room temperature single photon emission and particularly long electron and nuclear spin coherence times compared to other solid state defect centers  @xcite . in the field of quantum optics ,",
    "the nv@xmath5 has notably been applied in experiments demonstrating spin - photon entanglement  @xcite , distant spin entanglement  @xcite , quantum teleportation  @xcite , and finally the first loophole free demonstration of bell s inequality  @xcite .",
    "recently , entangled absorption was demonstrated mediated by an inherent spin - orbit entanglement in a single nv@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "also the coherent transfer of a photon to a single solid - state nuclear spin qubit with an average fidelity of 98% and storage times over 10 seconds demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the nv@xmath5 , the negatively charged silicon vacancy defect center ( siv@xmath5 ) has recently gained attention as an optically accessible single spin system .",
    "notably , the siv@xmath5 in pure , strain free crystals possesses optical transitions that are naturally nearly fourier - transform - limited and insensitive to environmental noise .",
    "this has enabled the demonstration of high - fidelity hong - ou - mandel interference between photons emitted by two siv@xmath5 centers  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the spin coherence times are currently limited by phonon interactions to several 10s of nanoseconds , which is many orders of magnitude lower than that of the nv@xmath5 .",
    "the realization of diamond - based photonic devices requires that optical design parameters are accurately transferred into diamond by either an additive  @xcite or subtractive approach .",
    "we will focus on the subtractive approach , as it is more common for well designed photonic structures .",
    "various fabrication methods have been used to demonstrate photonic devices in diamond  @xcite . focused ion beam ( fib ) milling defines and transfers the photonic pattern directly into diamond  @xcite .",
    "direct electron beam lithography ( ebl ) writing defines a pattern with nanometer precision in an electron beam resist layer and is usually combined with a subsequent dry etching step to transfer the photonic pattern into the diamond .",
    "transferrable silicon mask lithography  @xcite exploits the relatively mature fabrication process on silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) samples , and provides high etch selectivity for the subsequent oxygen etching step . due to the lack of commercially available diamond thin films of optical thickness , 3-dimensional ( 3d ) monolithic patterning techniques",
    "have also been developed such as angular fib and rie etching  @xcite and isotropic etching  @xcite techniques .",
    "all successful photonic devices must begin with high - purity single crystal diamond .",
    "while initial defect studies were done on natural diamond , current nano - photonic structures are made from synthetic diamond .",
    "chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) and high - pressure high - temperature ( hpht ) growth allow for the production of low strain single - crystal diamond with controllable defect concentrations  @xcite .",
    "these high - quality single - crystal diamonds are limited in size to a few tens of mm@xmath6 , while polycrystalline films and bulk diamonds can be grown on significantly larger scales , though with less control over lattice strain and defect inclusion across the sample .",
    "growth process parameters strongly influence the quality of the crystal and the concentration and type of lattice defects , making diamond growth still technically challenging , though high quality synthetic diamonds are available commercially .",
    "ultra - pure diamond , categorized as type iia for low nitrogen and boron content , is often used as a starting point for quantum optics applications because of higher purity .",
    "in fact , defects in ultra - pure diamond can be eliminated down to levels @xmath7  ppb .",
    "however , desired defects can also be introduced in the diamond growth up to high levels @xmath8  ppm , allowing for control of the native defect densities across several orders of magnitude .",
    "this approach can avoid crystalline damage associated with defect creation through implantation , and has been shown to provide long spin - coherence times  @xcite , high defect density or spatially - selected defect layers  @xcite as will be discussed in section  4c .",
    "further insights into the synthesis of single crystal diamond by hpht or cvd methods , either by homoepitaxial growth  @xcite or heteroepitaxial deposition on large - area single crystals of a foreign material are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "many photonic systems that confine light on the order of the wavelength are based on thin film substrates which are either suspended or supported by a lower index of refraction material to achieve total internal reflection . for single mode devices operating resonantly with color centers in the visible range",
    ", such a thin film has to be on the order of 200  nm in thickness .",
    "in contrast to many other semi - conductor materials , single crystal diamond growth is challenging and has been limited mainly to diamond - on - diamond techniques , precluding the use of an underlying sacrificial layer or lower index material .",
    "one very promising exception is the heteroepitaxial growth via bias - enhanced nucleation  @xcite on iridium / yttria - stabilized zirconia buffer layers on silicon ( layer structure : diamond / ir / ysz / si(001 ) )  @xcite . due to an unmatched degree of initial alignment and extraordinary high density of such epitaxial diamond grains on the iridium layer",
    ", they can lose their polycrystalline character during subsequent textured growth within a few to tens of micrometers  @xcite .",
    "a several hundred nanometer thick suspended diamond membrane can be fabricated by first removing the silicon substrate and buffer layers and then dry - etching the polycrystalline backside of the diamond  @xcite .    for the fabrication of diamond thin films from bulk diamond substrates ,",
    "different methods have been developed .",
    "fib milling has been pursued for the separation of small diamond slabs from the bulk  @xcite .",
    "however , the highly physical nature of the ion bombardment causes crystal damage as evidenced by raman spectroscopy , photoluminescence  @xcite , and transmission electron microscopy  @xcite .",
    "reactive ion etching ( rie ) of slabs was seen to cause less crystal damage  @xcite in the final product , allowing for spin coherence times approaching 100@xmath9s  @xcite . however , this rie method only allowed for the production of small ( @xmath10m@xmath6 ) membranes , which limits the ability to post - process and fabricate more complex photonic structures .",
    "there has also been work towards the separation of a diamond film from the bulk via the controlled creation of a damage layer .",
    "mev ions accelerated at the diamond crystal will stop at an energy - dependent depth .",
    "the damage caused by collisions with the lattice will create a well - localized graphite layer that can be removed via a wet - etch step  @xcite .",
    "crystal damage is inevitably induced in the removed membrane .",
    "however , this can be mitigated with a strategic etch of the damaged side  @xcite , and subsequent diamond overgrowth  @xcite , allowing for high quality spin properties of defect centers  @xcite .",
    "fib milling of diamond , in which carbon atoms are mechanically removed from the lattice with accelerated ga@xmath11 ions , or o@xmath12 ions is a masks process which can be used for fabrication of diamond photonic devices  @xcite .",
    "the spatial resolution is mainly limited by the ion beam width .",
    "this gives several advantages for diamond patterning : ( i ) a mask is not required , eliminating the need for special handling or resist spinning , and ( ii ) optical isolation from the bulk is achieved simply by tilting the stage to etch at an angle relative to the beam and to undercut the structure  @xcite .",
    "fib milling has been used to demonstrate nanobeam cavities  @xcite and free - standing , undercut bridge structures  @xcite in bulk diamond , and two - dimensional ( 2d ) photonic cavities  @xcite in a single crystal diamond layer on a buffered si substrate . however , this technique is limited by the relatively long milling time and inclined side walls  @xcite leading to limited cavity quality - factors , and the residual damage to the diamond material , which results in reduced color center properties as well as additional optical and spin background . the material damage from ion milling",
    "can be partially removed either by acid treatment and oxidation step  @xcite or using electron beam induced local etching  @xcite .",
    "this minimizes the optical losses and fluorescence background from the ion contamination .",
    "ebl is widely used for defining patterns with nanometer feature size , and is applied in combination with an etching method , most often rie or inductively coupled plasma ( icp ) rie .",
    "ebl typically requires a conductive substrate that is several millimeters in size and an e - beam resist having sufficient etch selectivity with respect to the substrate for the subsequent pattern transfer .",
    "these requirements are challenging to satisfy for small , insulating diamond samples . coating diamond with a conductive layer",
    "is widely used to minimize charging during ebl writing .",
    "hydrogen silsesquioxane ( hsq ) resist is a high resolution e - beam resist that can be used to pattern diamond  @xcite .",
    "its modest intrinsic selectivity to standard diamond rie etch recipes can be enhanced by post - development electron curing  @xcite .",
    "the etch selectivity can be further enhanced with other mask layers patterned via lift - off , or an initial short dry or wet etch step .",
    "such recipes have been used to demonstrate diamond nanowires  @xcite , suspended waveguide and nanobeam cavities  @xcite , diamond plasmonic apertures  @xcite , and gratings  @xcite .      to avoid spin - coating small diamond samples and exposing them to electron , ion , or uv radiation ,",
    "a novel nanofabrication technique  @xcite was developed as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sipatterning ] . instead of defining a mask directly on the diamond substrate ,",
    "a frameless single - crystal silicon membrane mask is pre - patterned from ( soi ) samples  @xcite and placed onto the diamond substrate silicon using membrane - transfer techniques  @xcite .",
    "this enables pattern transfer with feature sizes down to 10 nm , etch selectivity of over 38 for the subsequent oxygen rie , and automatic positioning of ion implantation apertures with respect to the photonic structure , as will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ artificialcreation ] with alignment accuracy guaranteed by the ebl writing .",
    "for patterning of the silicon masks , high resolution ebl is applied , in combination with well developed rie .    by applying one of two complimentary transfer techniques",
    ", one can place both small and large masks on diamond substrates with sizes up to 200  x  200  @xmath9 m , and 1  x  1  mm , as required by the sample size to be patterned . for small masks ,",
    "a pick - and - place method is applied based on nanomanipulation of a micro - polydimethylsiloxane ( pdms ) adhesive attached to a tungsten probe tip . for large masks ,",
    "a stamping approach is used with a transparent polytetrafluoroethylene ( ptfe ) sheet  @xcite .",
    "after the pattern is transferred to diamond by oxygen etching , the si membrane masks are mechanically removed , avoiding solvent - based mask removal procedures on diamond substrates .    the si mask patterning was applied for various photonic nanostructures in both bulk samples  @xcite and diamond thin films with sizes down to hundreds of square microns  @xcite . to pattern diamond membranes with @xmath13  nm thickness ,",
    "the diamond membranes are adhered to a si substrate , the patterned si mask is put on the diamond membrane using the pick - and - place technique , photonic patterns are transferred into the diamond membrane by oxygen rie , the si mask is mechanically removed , and finally isotropic sf@xmath14 plasma is applied to undercut the etched diamond photonic structure for optical measurements .      as discussed above , the fabrication of large uniform thin film diamond samples has not yet been developed .",
    "this limits the fabrication of diamond devices that guide and capture light when 2d or 3d confinement is required . to achieve the needed optical isolation for photonic structures in bulk diamond , and to circumvent the need for large thin film diamond samples for patterning",
    ", alternative fabrication approaches have been demonstrated that enable the monolithic patterning of waveguide and cavity structures into bulk diamond .",
    "one design concept is based on suspended devices with triangular cross - section .",
    "such designs can be realized by angled etching , either by rotating the sample  @xcite and milling by fib , or by guiding the trajectory of ions with a faraday cage  @xcite in an rie process .",
    "angular etching was used to demonstrate race - track patterns with ultra high quality factor ( q factor )  @xcite and one - dimensional ( 1d ) nanobeam cavities@xcite .",
    "another technique to produce free - standing structures is a quasi - isotropic oxygen undercut .",
    "this technique is based on the combination of standard vertical rie and zero forward bias oxygen plasma etching at an elevated sample temperature .",
    "this zero bias etching takes advantage of the low directionality of the oxygen ions and the thermally activated diamond surface leading to a quasi - isotropic chemical etching effect .",
    "this technique has enabled high - q cavities in a nanofabricated photonic disk  @xcite , and high mechanical quality factor waveguides  @xcite .",
    "color centers can be found in natural or as - grown synthetic diamond .",
    "however , for high quality samples with very low defect concentrations ( e.g. n<1ppm ) the concentration of color centers is too low for many of the intended applications  @xcite , and the distribution is random .",
    "controlled creation of defect centers is important for the fabrication of photonic constituents in a scalable way and for the extension beyond present proof - of - principle implementations .",
    "one can differentiate between methods that rely on ( i ) activation of incorporated defects in as - grown diamond  @xcite ,",
    "( ii ) controlled incorporation of defects during growth  @xcite , and ( iii ) controlled implantation of defects after diamond growth  @xcite .",
    "combinations of these methods have also been demonstrated .",
    "for example , activation methods can be combined with the controlled or targeted placement methods  @xcite .",
    "a very powerful tool is the spatially deterministic creation via focused ion beam or masked implantation  @xcite .",
    "these methods enable high yield creation of nanostructures with incorporated defect centers .",
    "the synthetic creation of defect centers depends on a wide range of parameters ; annealing temperature , vacancy density , and local charge environment have all been shown to affect nv creation . while many works address nv formation as a function of these parameters , the detailed mechanism of color center creation is still not definitively understood . until recently , it was commonly proposed that diffusing vacancies are trapped by substitutional atoms ( e.g. , nitrogen ) to create a color center ( e.g. , the nv )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the established recipes for creating defect centers rely on annealing above 600@xmath15c , at which temperature vacancies become mobile  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has been questioned by advanced density functional theory ( dft ) calculations that were applied to determine the formation and excitation energies , the charge transition levels , and the diffusion activation energies for nitrogen- and vacancy - related defects in diamond  @xcite .",
    "these calculations concluded that irradiation of diamond is more likely to directly create nv defects , and not isolated vacancies .",
    "direct nv creation has been shown without thermal annealing by irradiation of diamond that has been implanted with nitrogen ions with low - energy electrons ( @xmath16  kev )  @xcite and beams of swift heavy ions ( @xmath171  gev , @xmath174  mev / u )  @xcite . however , this model of direct nv creation is contradicted by other works .",
    "for example , experimental results still show evidence of high vacancy mobility and indicate formation of nvs after implantation during annealing  @xcite .",
    "further fundamental investigation of defect center creation is required to understand this process in full detail .",
    "annealing temperatures are a crucial tool to control the concentration of different types of lattice and crystal defects .",
    "while it is in principle sufficient to anneal samples just above above 600@xmath15c , temperatures around 850@xmath15c were chosen for most demonstrations over the past years .",
    "recently , temperatures up to 1200@xmath15c are being applied to reduce strain and lattice defects , leading to increased spin - coherence times of nv@xmath5s  @xcite . for the siv@xmath5 this leads to a narrowing of the inhomogeneous distribution from @xmath18  nm ( after 800@xmath15c anneal ) to 0.03  nm ( 15  ghz , after 1100@xmath15c anneal ) , and results in nearly lifetime - limited optical linewidths  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , above 1100@xmath15c the concentration of di - vacancies is reduced as their bonds are broken .",
    "di - vacancies are suspected to influence the photostability of nv@xmath19 centers  @xcite and spectral diffusion properties of the nv@xmath5 zpl . for n implantation doses of @xmath20/cm@xmath6 , energies of 85  kev and annealing up to 1200@xmath15c",
    ", stable optical transitions of the nv@xmath5 zpl with linewidth down to 27  mhz have been demonstrated  @xcite , which is close to the lifetime - limited emission linewidth of about @xmath1713  mhz  @xcite .",
    "charge - state stability has been shown to be directly effected by surface termination , with fluorination leading to a higher concentration of stable nv@xmath19 centers  @xcite .",
    "it is commonly assumed that surface treatment also affects the nv@xmath5 zpl stability  @xcite .",
    "however this has not been systematically studied in the literature at the time of this review .",
    "defect centers can be formed by the creation of additional vacancies in doped diamond by irradiation with energetic neutrons , electrons , or ions  @xcite in combination with a subsequent annealing step above 600@xmath15c . in this process , ions already present in the diamond lattice can be combined with the newly created vacancies .",
    "early work used electron and ga@xmath11 beams to irradiate n - rich type - ib diamond to create vacancies and indirectly defect centers , in particular nv centers , from already incorporated n ions . for an unpatterned diamond surface , a spatial lateral resolution below 180",
    "nm was achieved  @xcite .",
    "controlling the creation depth relative to the surface is challenging , as lattice defects are created along the path of the particle in the lattice , and the scattering cross - section varies for every species .",
    "scanning focused he - ion irradiation and subsequent annealing was also applied for the creation of nv centers  @xcite . while these works achieve spatially localized nv creation , large areas , in particular entire samples , can also be irradiated to create large ensembles .",
    "such large area irradiation was , for example , used to create a millimeter - scale diamond sample with about 16  ppm ( corresponding to @xmath22 ) nvs  @xcite .",
    "such samples with large ensembles of spins enable magnetic - field measurements with sensitivities down to @xmath23 in the low - frequency regime around 1  hz  @xcite . for effective sensor volumes of @xmath24  mm@xmath25 and ensembles of @xmath26 nv@xmath5s ,",
    "photon - shot - noise - limited magnetic - field sensitivity was demonstrated with a sensitivity of 0.9  pt@xmath27 for ac signals of @xmath28  khz .",
    "an alternative way of controlling the depth of defect centers relative to the diamond surface is delta - doping .",
    "this has been experimentally demonstrated for the nv@xmath5  @xcite and the siv@xmath5  @xcite . for the nv ,",
    "a nanometer - thick nitrogen - doped layer is created by the controlled introduction of n@xmath12 gas during plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( pecvd ) diamond growth .",
    "similarly , siv@xmath5s are created by controlling the si concentration during the growth , giving control of the concentration over two orders of magnitude .",
    "subsequent electron irradiation and annealing leads to formation of nv centers in a thin layer .",
    "this final nv creation process causes less crystal damage than direct ion implantation methods  @xcite , and is therefore advantageous for both long spin - coherence times and stable and narrow spectral linewidth .",
    "delta - doped diamond thin - films have been applied to couple ensembles of nv@xmath5s to a nanobeam photonic crystal cavity , demonstrating that this technique could be interesting for single - nv cavity coupled systems  @xcite . however , in this work confinement was demonstrated in 1d only , but could be combined with fib or ebeam activation to achieve 3d confinement . for high - resolution sensing in fluids ,",
    "delta - doping enabled engineered diamond probes with diameter and height ranging from 100 nm to 700 nm and 500 nm to 2@xmath9 m , respectively  @xcite .    besides incorporating atomic defects into the lattice",
    ", the concept of delta doping can also be applied to engineer specific nuclear spin environments , e.g. , nanometer - thick layers of @xmath29c in ultra - pure natural abundance @xmath29c diamond by switching between purified @xmath2ch@xmath30 and @xmath29ch@xmath30 ( 99.99% ) source gases  @xcite during diamond pecvd growth .",
    "this is promising for the creation of a controlled number or distribution of @xmath29c nuclear spin memories , which could be used for spin - spin entanglement , quantum error correction protocols or for quantum simulators  @xcite .",
    "the most common method for the creation of color centers is direct ion implantation of a color center constituent  for example , n , si , cr , or other ions  @xcite  into the diamond crystal . subsequent annealing creates defect centers .",
    "this method enables control of the center depth with respect to the surface , as can be determined via srim simulations  @xcite .",
    "the first demonstration of this method used n ions with @xmath172  mev energy , corresponding to an implantation depth of about 1.15  @xmath9 m  @xcite .",
    "shallow nv@xmath5s were created with 7  kev ion energy , corresponding to an implantation depth of about 10  nm , and the typical @xmath31n 2-fold hyperfine splitting was demonstrated , in contrast to a 3-fold hyperfine splitting for natural @xmath32n defects  @xcite .",
    "single photon emission was demonstrated from single siv@xmath5 centers created via ion implantation of @xmath33si ions  @xcite . to further understand the creation process of color centers via ion implantation , the creation efficiency of nvs as a function of ion energy was experimentally determined  @xcite and compared to theoretical models , leading to 25% nv creation yield per implanted nitrogen ion  @xcite .",
    "all these examples have not demonstrated control of the lateral position of created color centers .",
    "the relative alignment of color centers to each other is important for the deterministic arrangement in an array , in particular if these centers are used as a grid of sensors or as a network of entangled spins .",
    "depending on the application , lattice constants as low as tens of nanometers are required with precise positioning at each lattice site .",
    "one way to achieve this goal is the targeted implantation through 30  nm apertures in the tip of an atomic force microscope ( afm )  @xcite .",
    "this afm method was combined with stimulated emission depletion microscopy  @xcite to demonstrate nanometer - scale mapping of randomly distributed nv@xmath5s within a less than 100  nm diameter spot  @xcite .",
    "a different method for the precise relative alignment of color centers is the implantation through large - scale lithographically defined apertures , for example , ebl written apertures in beam resist  @xcite or ebl patterned si - masks . in the latter experiment , ensembles of individually resolvable",
    "nv@xmath5s were created with nanometer - scale apertures in ultrahigh - aspect ratio implantation masks .",
    "these masks were fabricated by narrowing down apertures via atomic - layer - deposition ( ald ) of alumina , enabling a gaussian fwhm spatial distribution of about 26.3  nm , thus , reaching the lateral implantation straggle limit  @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : targetcreation ] .",
    "irradiation is not limited to as - grown diamond but can also be used to increase the creation yield of delta - doped samples .",
    "for example , @xmath2c implantation of a delta - doped sample post - growth , creates additional lattice defects , and individual nv@xmath5s can be localized within a volume of ( 180  nm)@xmath25 in an unpatterned diamond at a predetermined position defined by an implantation aperture  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , by combining delta - doping for vertical confinement , and electron irradiation in a transmission electron microscope ( tem ) for lateral confinement , nv@xmath5s were created in a volume of less than 4  nm  x  1  @xmath9m@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "a very versatile tool for the creation of color center arrays is focused ion beam implantation .",
    "it is maskless and enables the implantation of almost arbitrary patterns .",
    "similar to the electron beam in an scanning electron microscope , a focused ion beam can be applied to control the position and concentration of ions .",
    "this method has been used to implant n ions within a spot size of approximately 100 nm  @xcite .",
    "similarly , arrays of silicon - vacancy centers were created by low - energy focused ion beam implantation  @xcite .",
    "these are promising methods towards the targeted coupling of single defect centers to nanostructures .",
    "the deterministic coupling of a single or few color centers to a photonic nanostructure , in particular a high - q cavity , is one of the most important prerequisites for the upscaling of qi architectures .",
    "such deterministic coupling was recently demonstrated by fabrication of a photonic crystal cavity around a pre - characterized siv@xmath5 by fib milling  @xcite enabling a resonant purcell enhancement of the zero - phonon transition by a factor of 19 , mainly limited by the positioning accuracy . to achieve a higher positioning accuracy , targeted implantation of ions into a photonic crystal cavity",
    "was realized with the afm method discussed earlier , and purcell enhancement of single nv@xmath5 centers was demonstrated  @xcite . a more scalable fabrication method for cavity - defect center systems",
    "is based on an implantation mask with small apertures of @xmath34  nm in diameter for targeting a large number of cavity mode maxima with a wide @xmath31n beam  @xcite . by combining",
    "the nanocavity etch mask with an implantation mask into a single physical mask , rie etching ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : diamondpatterning ] ) and implantation can be carried out subsequently without the need of challenging re - alignment processes for two - mask processes . with this method , intensity enhancement of a factor up to 20",
    "was demonstrated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : targetcreationl3 ] )  @xcite .",
    "+      to achieve optimal light - matter coupling in cavities and other photonic systems , the defect centers must not only have precise spatial positing with respect to the optical field , but their emission dipoles must also be correctly aligned .",
    "each color center has an individual atom - vacancy composition and geometry , and therefore a certain emission dipole orientation .",
    "for instance , the nv center has four possible orientations with respect to the crystal lattice . naturally occurring nv populations have a random distribution of orientations . in the last few years",

    "as discussed in this review , recent advances in diamond synthesis and fabrication have enabled high - quality nano- and microphotonic devices for increased photon collection and tailored light - matter interaction . despite this progress , there are still fundamental challenges to be overcome on the way towards more complex qi implementations based on these diamond photonic nanostructures .",
    "high fidelity qi applications require long spin coherence times and lifetime limited emission linewidths  @xcite .",
    "as noted in the review , many diamond growth and fabrication schemes have been tailored to bolster spin coherence times .",
    "however , more development must be done to produce nanostructures with both high intrinsic quality ( high q values and low mode volumes ) and high defect quality ( long spin coherence times and lifetime limited emission linewidths ) .",
    "in particular the latter has up to date been limited to a factor of about 30 of the fluorescence lifetime - limit @xcite .",
    "it is commonly believed that both crystal lattice defects induced by dry etching and increased surface area near defects due to nanofabrication lead to the degradation of defect properties .",
    "therefore , suitable nanofabrication technology and proper surface termination methods must be developed .",
    "furthermore , the realization of large - scale quantum photonic systems will depend on _ scalable fabrication _ techniques and on _ tunability _  stark shift control to bring multiple defect transitions ( e.g. the nv@xmath19 zpl ) to the same frequency  @xcite , and cavity tuning  @xcite to match the resonance wavelength with the defect transition frequency without degrading the cavity q. finally , for high fidelity information processing , error correction is required . to establish error - corrected logical qubit nodes in a large quantum photonic processor @xcite",
    ", advances must be made in the high yield creation of coupled defect centers @xcite as well as control over the surrounding nuclear environment as resource to potentially store quantum states longer than an individual quantum memory is able to @xcite .",
    "the progress presented in this review proves the viability of diamond based nanophotonic systems in qi and sensing , and further progress will enable enhanced sensing as well as scalable solid state quantum networks .",

    "<S> the past decade has seen great advances in developing color centers in diamond for sensing , quantum information processing , and tests of quantum foundations . increasingly , the success of these applications as well as fundamental investigations of light - matter interaction depend on improved control of optical interactions with color centers  from better fluorescence collection to efficient and precise coupling with confined single optical modes . </S>",
    "<S> wide ranging research efforts have been undertaken to address these demands through advanced nanofabrication of diamond . </S>",
    "<S> this review will cover recent advances in diamond nano- and microphotonic structures for efficient light collection , color center to nanocavity coupling , hybrid integration of diamond devices with other material systems , and the wide range of fabrication methods that have enabled these complex photonic diamond systems . </S>"
