    "after numerous theoretical and experimental studies , the nematic - isotropic ( n - i ) transition in liquid crystals still poses certain controversies and reveals new , interesting facets .",
    "for example , although geometrical arguments lead to the conclusion that the nematic@xmath4isotropic transition is of first - order @xcite , measurements of enthalpy and volume changes at the transition , when compared with experimental results at melting , fully support the scenario of a weak first - order phase transition with strong fluctuations , which may lead to an effective critical behavior and an effective critical exponent @xcite . although there are no systematic or conclusive studies on this thermodynamic behavior , a few experimental studies point to the occurrence of tricritical , rather than just critical effective exponents @xcite .",
    "curiously , there is scarce literature on the behavior of the nonlinear optical response of liquid crystals at this phase transition .",
    "recently we reported on the divergence of the nonlinear optical birrefringence @xmath5 in the nematic side of the n - i transition of the thermotropic liquid crystal e7 , measured with a cw laser at @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the critical exponent seems to corroborate the tri - critical character of this phase transition .",
    "previously , li et al .",
    "@xcite had shown that the optical absorption of a pure sample of 5cb under ms - pulses of a @xmath7 cw laser is linear at the nematic side of the n - i transition , i. e. , @xmath8 .",
    "although multiphoton absorption processes are usually observed under intense pulsed laser irradiation , there are many reports on the observation of two - photon absorption under irradiation of middle or low power cw lasers in highly absorbing dye - doped liquid crystal , as consequence of a two - photon absorption process @xcite or to reorientation of the nematic director @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to report on the observation of nonlinear optical absorption in a planar oriented sample of the thermotropic liquid crystal e7 and its enhancement in the neighborhood of the n - i phase transition , under irradiation by a middle - power @xmath6 cw laser . in section 2",
    "we describe the z - scan technique , which is used for measuring the nonlinear optical absorption coefficient @xmath1 . in section 3",
    "we present the experimental data and discuss the possibles mechanisms for the nonlinear absrption observed in our case .",
    "finally , in section 4 we sum up the conclusions .",
    "the abbreviation e7 stands for a liquid crystal mixture consisting of several types of cyanobiphenyls , mainly 5cb , and in less quantity , triphenyl .",
    "it exhibits a nematic phase in the temperature interval from @xmath9 up to the transition to the isotropic phase at @xmath10 . in this experiment we used commercial e7 ( merck ) , without additional purification .",
    "the samples were conditioned in a parallel glass cell , separated by @xmath11 thick spacers .",
    "the glass plates were coated with pva ( polyvinyl alcohol ) and buffed for homogeneous planar alignment of the liquid crystal .",
    "the sample was placed in a hot stage ( instec ) on a computer - controlled translational stage ( newport ) .",
    "the temperature of the sample was controlled with a precision of @xmath12 between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the z - scan technique exploits the formation of a lens in a medium by a tightly focused gaussian - profile laser beam , measuring the transmitted intensity of the sample as a function of position along the direction of propagation of the beam ( the @xmath15-axis ) @xcite .",
    "the magnitude and sign of the nonlinear absorption @xmath1 can be obtained by means of the open - aperture configuration of the @xmath16-scan technique . a sketch of the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "1 . in this setup",
    "the totality of the power at the exit of the sample is measured .",
    "our experimental setup used a cw laser ( @xmath6 , verdi , coherent ) , and the power of the laser was about @xmath17 close to the n - i transition and reaching @xmath18 far from the transition .",
    "the beam waist at focus was about @xmath19 m , and an osciloscope ( tektronics , standfor ) was used for data acquisition .",
    "the polarization ( @xmath20 ) of the laser beam was set either parallel or perpendicular to the nematic director ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "for these geometrical configurations the optical torque is null , i.  e. , director reorientation is not expected .    in systems exhibiting nonlinear absorption , for sufficiently thin samples , and to first - order corrections in the irradiance ,",
    "the normalized transmittance in the open - aperture ( @xmath22 ) configuration of the z - scan technique is given by @xcite @xmath23}.\\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] here @xmath24 is the rayleigh range of the beam , @xmath25 , where @xmath26/\\alpha_{0}$ ] is the effective thickness of the sample , @xmath1 is the nonlinear optical absorption coefficient , and _ _  _ _ @xmath27 is the irradiance at the waist of the laser beam .",
    "although eq .",
    "[ eq:1 ] is derived assuming a two - photon absorption process , it can be applied to fit the open - aperture z - scan curve in any case , assigning to @xmath1 the meaning of an effective nonlinear optical absorption coefficient .",
    "in figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) , we show typical open - aperture @xmath16-scan traces , obtained at @xmath28 ( nematic phase ) for the two relative orientations of the nematic director and beam polarization , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the error bars correspond to the standard error of the mean for at least ten measurements in each @xmath15 position .",
    "as can be seen , for @xmath29 the transmittance of the sample increases when approaching the focal point , showing that the nonlinear optical absorption is negative ( @xmath31 ) . for @xmath30 the transmittance decreases as the focal point is approached , which shows that the nonlinear optical absorption is poistive ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "whitin the sensitivity of our experimental setup , no nonlinear optical absorption was observed in the isotropic phase ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "we have also checked the nonlinear optical response of the empty glass cell with pva coating : for the intensities in our experiment the cell does not show any nonlinear optical response .    in figure 3",
    "we show @xmath1 in the nematic region and in the isotropic phase , for polarization of the incident beam parallel and perpendicular to the director . for each relative orientation of the the director and the optical field ,",
    "the @xmath1 s resulting from the fittings were rather independent of the laser beam power .",
    "for @xmath29 , the sample displays @xmath31 and for @xmath30 , the sample displays @xmath32 over the entire nematic region , i.  e. , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , with increasing absolute values as the n - i transition temperature is approached from below .",
    "it is also clear that the magnitude of @xmath36 is bigger than that of @xmath37 .",
    "the fitting of the experimental data with eq .",
    "[ eq:1 ] gives an effective nonlinear absorption coefficient @xmath1 for the nonlinear optical process observed in the e7 liquid crystal of about @xmath38 and @xmath39 , for @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the origin of the nonlinear optical response in the nematic phase and its enhancement when aproaching the n - i transition is not clear yet .",
    "the optical absorption of liquid crystals containing satured and unsatured phenyl is relevant in the uv spectral region , involving @xmath40 electronic transitions , which have negligible absorption in the visible range @xcite .",
    "as shown by the pioneering work of chatelain @xcite , the linear scattering due to fluctuations of the nematic director is strong for small scattering wavevector @xmath41 and weakly dependent on temperature .",
    "measurements of the scattering in a e7 liquid - crystal sample showed an approximately constant scattering coefficient over almost all of the nematic range , with a light increase in a temperature interval of about @xmath42 in the vicinity of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "linear scattering makes the transmitted power independent of the sample position , leading to a flat response in the normalized transmittance curve in an open - aperture z - scan measurement .",
    "another source of many nonresonant stimulated scattering processes , such as stimulated raman scattering ( srs ) , stimulated brillouin scattering ( sbs ) , stimulated orientational scattering ( sos ) and stimulated thermal scattering ( sts ) , have been observed in thermotropic liquid crystals under appropriate conditions @xcite .",
    "usually the srs and sbs processes require long interation paths ( of the order of 1 ) and very strong lasers @xcite . in the case of sos",
    ", the forward orthogonal polarized beam generated by stimulated scattering grows like @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the intensity gain factor and @xmath45 is an effective loss coefficient combining linear absorption and scattering processes . for a @xmath46-thick sample of e7 liquid crystal ,",
    "the threshold intensity is @xmath47 @xcite , comparable to the intensity in our setup for @xmath30 . for a @xmath11-thick sample ,",
    "therefore , the threshold intensity for an sos process is one order of magnitude higher .",
    "finally , a highly absorbing medium is necessary to trigger a sts process . in a @xmath48 planar aligned dye - doped sample of 5cb ,",
    "a sts process is observed when the interaction length is about @xmath49 , with oblique incidence and an incident laser power ( @xmath50 ) of @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "any nonlinear scattering in an open - aperture z - scan experiment should yield results resembling nonlinear absorption with @xmath32 , because along with the dominant forward beam this process originates a small amount of backscattered radiation for both incident lasers @xmath27 and @xmath52 ( @xmath30 and @xmath29 respectively ) .",
    "studies of the nonlinear scattering show that it is also nearly temperature independent @xcite and inversely proportional to the square of the beam wavelength , i.  e. , proportional to @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "a similar study of a planar oriented sample of 5cb @xcite , using the @xmath50 line of an argon laser at comparable power , showed no nonlinear optical absorption , either in the nematic phase or close to the n - i transition .",
    "although the wavelength in our setup lies close to the maximum absorbance of the e7 liquid crystal , two - photon absorption can be ruled out in view of the low laser power .",
    "two - photon absorption with low - power lasers has only been observed in highly absorbing dye - doped liquid crystals , which is not the case here .",
    "a more likely source of nonlinear absorption is laser - induced reorientation of absorbing species as seen in a @xmath54-thick homeotropically oriented sample of dye - doped 5cb @xcite .",
    "an optical field exerts an optical torque proportional to the dieletric anisotropy @xmath55 @xcite . from the balance between the elastic torque and the optical torque , under hard - boundary and small director - reorientation conditions",
    ", it can be shown that the maximum reorientation @xmath56 for an extradordinary ray is proportional to @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the elastic constant for splay distortion . since @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the maximum reorientation in the nematic phase satisfies @xmath61 .",
    "it follows that @xmath56 increases as @xmath62 approaches @xmath14 . in the case of an ordinary ray ,",
    "the threshold intensity for diretor reorientation is proportional do @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the elastic constant for bend distortion .",
    "hence , the nonlinear absorption observed in the e7 liquid crystal below @xmath14 could be due to the reorientation of absorbing species present in the liquid cristalline matrix along with a reduction of ordening associated with heating that leads to absorption depletion , a reduction expected to be more effective in the case of an extraordinary ray .    in the nematic phase , given the dichroic ratio @xmath65 of the sample , i. e. , the ratio between the linear absorbances of radiation with the polarization parallel and perpendicular to director , an optical order parameter @xmath66 can be defined , provided the transition moment is parallel to the molecular axis @xcite . by analogy , we can define a nonlinear dichroic ratio @xmath67 and the parameter @xmath68 .",
    "figure 4 displays @xmath2 as a function of @xmath62 .",
    "clearly , @xmath2 vanishes at the n - i transition and is equal to zero in the isotropic phase .",
    "figure 5 displays @xmath2 as a function of the reduced temperature in log scales . also shown",
    "is a linear fit , close the transition temperature , under the assumption that @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the critical exponent and @xmath71 is the temperature of the effective or virtual second order transition seen from below @xmath14 , which is different from the spinodal temperature @xmath72 , the absolute limit of the nematic phase upon heating .",
    "for an homologus series of liquid crystals it has been shown that @xmath73 @xcite , which is of the order of the experimental uncertainty in our measurements .",
    "this considered and attention paid to the sensitivity of the fitting to the choice of @xmath71 , we proceded to vary @xmath71 between @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the resulting average critical exponent @xmath70 was @xmath76 , close to the accepted value for the order - parameter critical exponent under the assumption that the n - i transition has tricritical character .",
    "we have investigated the nonlinear optical absorption of an homogeneously oriented sample of liquid crystal e7 in the nematic phase and close to the n - i transition under continuos @xmath77 wave excitation .",
    "the effective nonlinear optical absorption exhibits opposite character for the two geometrical configurations of the nematic director relative to the polarization of the incident beam , i.  e. , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we tentatively ascribe this behavior to the combination of an optical - field induced reorientation of the nematic director and heating of the sample due to absorbing species in the liquid cristalline matrix .",
    "interestingly , the coefficiente @xmath2 , defined from the @xmath1 s in an analogy to the optical order parameter _ s _ defined from the linear optical - absorption coefficients , satisfies an order - parameter power law with critical exponent @xmath76 , which points to a n - i tansition with tricritical character .",
    "this work had the financial support of the brazilian agencies capes , cnpq , fapesp , fundao araucria and the secretaria de cincia , tecnologia e ensino superior do governo do paran , and it was conducted as part of the research program of the instituto nacional de cincia e tecnologia de fluidos complexos ( inct - fcx ) .",
