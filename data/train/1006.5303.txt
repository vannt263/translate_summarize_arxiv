    "the hamiltonian @xmath3 with @xmath1 real positive , has been a subject of a number of studies since it has been conjectured by bessis and zinn - justin ( 1992 ) to have a real spectrum .",
    "arguably , eq .   provides the simplest example of a @xmath4symmetric hamiltonian , that is , of a hamiltonian invariant under a simultaneous complex conjugation ( _ i.e. _ , time reversal ) and parity transformation @xmath5 ( see ref .",
    "in particular , the reality of its spectrum was proven first in the strong coupling limit @xcite , then more generally in ref .",
    "@xcite ( together with the positivity of the eigenvalues ) .    here",
    ", we continue our investigations  @xcite regarding its numerical and analytic properties , including the analytic structure of its resonance energy eigenvalues as a function of the complex coupling parameter @xmath1 , specially in the strong coupling regime and near the first level crossing singularity .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 an energy eigenvalue of the hamiltonian  .",
    "one verifies that its perturbative expansion contains only integer powers of @xmath1 : @xmath6 with real coefficients @xmath7 .",
    "the series is divergent for all  @xmath1 , but is borel summable  @xcite , and a steepest descent calculation of the path integral representation of the corresponding quantum partition function @xcite yields a large order behaviour for the @xmath8th energy eigenvalue of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the instanton action .",
    "more recently , pad summability was also rigorously established in ref .",
    "the imaginary part of the energy levels on the cut for @xmath11 is positive .",
    "this proof confirms numerical investigations based on the summation of the perturbative expansion by pad approximants  @xcite .",
    "more information on analytic and numerical properties was provided by an odm summation  @xcite of the perturbative series for the ground state energy ( see ref .",
    "it was based on the mapping @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an order - dependent parameter .    in particular , the leading term of the strong coupling expansion could be determined ( and was found in agreement with results coming direct solutions of schrdinger equation @xcite ) and the positivity of the imaginary part verified numerically for all @xmath15 .",
    "it was shown that along the negative real axis , the imaginary part above the cut is a simple positive decreasing function interpolating smoothly between a strong coupling power - law behaviour and a non - analytic exponential tunneling factor obtained from semi - classical instanton calculation for weak coupling .",
    "finally , it was argued that the ground state energy is analytic up to @xmath16 in the second riemann sheet , a property that we discuss in this article in more detail .    by a simple coordinate translation , one can relate the hamiltonian to another @xmath4symmetric hamiltonian , @xmath17}}= - \\frac12 \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2 }   + { \\mathrm{i}}\\ ; \\left(\\frac16 \\ ; x^3 + \\frac12 \\ , \\chi \\ ; x   \\right ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 .",
    "this correspondence suggests to sum the series by another odm of the form @xmath19 which is shown here to be much more efficient in the strong coupling regime , while the mapping   ( and a variation thereof discussed below ) is more efficient for weak coupling .",
    "the method   is used here in order to determine a number of coefficients of the large @xmath1 expansion ( small @xmath20 expansion ) .",
    "finally , studying the limit of weak @xmath20 , we also construct a corresponding continued fraction ( a subclass of pad approximants ) , which enables us to obtain more insight into the analytic structure .    combining all methods",
    ", we have a precise control on the analytic continuation of the ground state energy in the first riemann sheet of the uniformization variable @xmath18 , except near the cut in the @xmath20-plane . based on our observation",
    ", we conjecture that the ground state energy of the hamiltonian is a real analytic function , with a cut on the real negative @xmath20 axis , which corresponds to a complex phase of @xmath21 for the original coupling parameter @xmath1 and thus lies on the second sheet of the riemann surface for the original coupling parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this domain is not covered by ref .",
    "the imaginary part of the ground state energy on the cut for @xmath22 is positive .",
    "the small @xmath20 expansion of the resonance energies converges in a disk .",
    "from the point of view of the initial hamiltonian , the singularity closest to the origin has the interpretation of a level crossing .",
    "this can be seen as follows : the cut for negative @xmath20 corresponds to a cut of the energy level on the second sheet  @xcite of the riemann surface ( `` bender  wu cut '' ) .",
    "it starts from the limit of the circle of convergence of the strong coupling expansion , i.e. , from a point on the boundary of the circle of convergence of the @xmath20 expansion .",
    "two resonance energies are attached to points infinitesimally displaced above and below the cut .",
    "the functions describing the real parts of the two resonance energies are equal on the cut .",
    "they cross as we cross the cut .",
    "by contrast , the functions describing their imaginary parts are equal and opposite on the cut and vary smoothly in its immediate vicinity .    at the start of the cut ,",
    "the imaginary part of the resonance and antiresonance energy is zero , but the real parts still cross , and this configuration therefore corresponds to a level crossing , given by the confluence of two energy levels on the second sheet of the riemann surface characterizing the resonance energies as a function of @xmath1 . for the hamiltonian , it corresponds , in addition , to a spontaneous breaking of the @xmath4symmetry ( namely , the spectrum composed of the resonance and antiresonance energies with their equal and opposite imaginary parts corresponds to a manifestly non-@xmath4symmetric time evolution ) . starting from the region where the two eigenvalues merge and are real , we can say that after the singularity , they become complex conjugate .    to confirm this picture , that is , analyticity in a cut - plane in the @xmath20 variable , sign of the imaginary part of the ground state energy on the cut and level merging singularity we investigate together the ground state and the first excited state , forming symmetric combinations : sum and difference squared of the corresponding energies .",
    "we verify that these functions are regular at the level merging singularity , showing that the level merging involves the ground state and the first excited state .",
    "this gives us a totally consistent picture and , moreover , allows us to determine with increased precision a number of terms of the small @xmath20 expansion . in turn , from the small @xmath20 expansion a continued fraction expansion is derived , whose coefficients are all positive and seem to converge to a value consistent with a square root singularity , within errors .    as a final remark ,",

    "it applies both to convergent and divergent series , although it is mainly useful in the latter situation .    in what follows ,",
    "we consider a function analytic in a sector and mappings @xmath56 of the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a real analytic function increasing on @xmath59 , such that @xmath60 and , for @xmath61 , @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",

    "an important property that singles out relevant mappings here is the following : one chooses mappings such that , for @xmath67 and thus @xmath68 , the quantity @xmath69 has a regular expansion in powers of @xmath70 .",

    "@xmath66 is given by a taylor series in @xmath71 of the form @xmath72 where the coefficients @xmath73 are polynomials of degree @xmath74 in @xmath14 .",

    ", the determination of the sequence of the @xmath84 s is the most time - consuming computational step .",
    "indeed , once the @xmath84 are known , for each value of @xmath1 , the calculation reduces to inverting the mapping and simply summing the taylor series in @xmath71 to the relevant order .",
    "we here give a heuristic analysis  @xcite of the convergence of the odm method that shows how the convergence can be optimized .",
    "this will justify the choice of the class of zeros of the polynomials @xmath91 or @xmath92 and provide a quantitative analysis of the corresponding convergence .    in order to focus the analysis",

    "we consider only real functions analytic in a cut - plane with a cut along the real negative axis and a cauchy representation of the form @xmath93 where the subtraction ensures the convergence of the integral for @xmath94 .",
