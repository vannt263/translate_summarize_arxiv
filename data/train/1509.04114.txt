    "increasing demand for quantitative predictions of material properties , coupled with growing complexity of materials of current research interest , promotes the development of high - accuracy methods from first principles .",
    "recently the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method has emerged as a viable approach to quantitative calculations of the properties of real materials with chemical identity@xcite .",
    "qmc methods comprise a suite of tools for calculation of material properties _ via _ stochastic solution of the many - particle schrdinger equation@xcite . because of their direct treatment of electron correlation , qmc methods are amongst the most accurate available and have a history of ground breaking , benchmark calculations@xcite .",
    "however , despite the successes of qmc thus far , an open question still remains as to the practical accuracy of the technique . in practice uncertainties",
    "arise from several approximations such as the use of pseudopotentials and the pseudopotential localization error@xcite , finite size effects@xcite , and the fixed node error that is present in fixed node diffusion monte carlo@xcite . at present , limitations in our understanding of the coupled effect of these uncertainties make practical usage of the technique challenging and hinder progress .",
    "the purpose of this manuscript is to present a systematic assessment of the uncertainties from these competing factors . as a case study",
    ", we have considered the semiconductors zinc selenide and zinc oxide in detail , and we quantify the size of uncertainties coming from the factors listed above .       finally , we consider the calculation of the @xmath0-point optically excited state in znse and zno . since both of these semiconductors have a direct gap at @xmath0 , the calculated optical excitation energy will correspond to the optical band gap .",
    "accurate calculation of band gaps will be a critical piece to establishing the functionality of the qmc method , so it is important to assess the scale and magnitude of finite size effects for such systems . to calculate the optical excitation energy ,",
    "we have adopted a procedure that has been used successfully previously  @xcite .",
    "the energy of the first optically excited state is calculated as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the ground state energy and @xmath3 is the @xmath0-point optically excited state .",
    "the energy @xmath3 is calculated by promoting an electron from the highest occupied kohn - sham orbital at @xmath0 to the lowest unoccupied orbital in the construction of the slater determinant . here ,",
    "both terms @xmath3 , @xmath2 are evaluated only at the @xmath0 point . since the optical excitation energy is an energy difference between two supercells of the same size and shape , the structure factor correction cancels out .",
    "accordingly , one might expect that the dominant @xmath4 scaling exhibited for the ground state energies in figs .",
    "[ znsetotalenergy],[znototalenergy ] should not be present , leaving behind a faster convergence with increasing supercell size .",
    "we are unaware of any existing detailed analysis of the scaling of finite size effects for optical excitation energies .    to analyze the behavior , in figs .",
    "[ znseoptenergy],[znooptenergy ] we report the computed gaps of znse and zno using the same supercells that were considered in figs . [ znsetotalenergy],[znototalenergy ] .",
    "since the precise scaling of the finite size effect is unknown , figs .",
    "[ znseoptenergy],[znooptenergy ] show the computed gap as a function of supercell size on a linear / linear scale .",
    "the insets show the same data plotted on a log / log scale to observe whether the scaling can be extracted . for znse ( fig .  [ znseoptenergy ] ) , the @xmath5 atom supercells are too small , but it appears that all supercells with @xmath6 and @xmath7 are converged within error bars and our calculated optical gap of 2.8(2 ) ev is in agreement with experiment . from the inset there is no evidence of @xmath4 scaling , consistent with the expectation that the convergence is faster .",
    "the situation is more complicated for zno ( fig .  [ znooptenergy ] ) , which exhibits the wurtzite structure .",
    "it is symmetry - broken from cubic zincblende with unequal lattice constants in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions . correspondingly , there are three orbitals at @xmath0 near the vbm which are slightly non - degenerate : one has orbitals aligned along the @xmath8 axis , and two have orbitals aligned within the @xmath9 plane .",
    "these are plotted in fig .",
    "[ znovalenceband ] . according to arpes measurements , the symmetry breaking is small , @xmath10 ev  @xcite .",
    "we address the bfd results for zno first , shown in fig .",
    "[ znooptenergy]b . as for znse",
    "the 8 atom supercells are too small , but the 16 and 32 atom supercells show more consistent trends , regardless of the supercell used .",
    "for the 32 atom supercells , our calculated excitation energy is 3.8(2 ) ev , which slightly overestimates the experimental value of 3.4 ev .",
    "in addition , the log / log plot in the inset also has no evidence of @xmath4 scaling , suggesting a faster convergence .",
    "we also tested the sensitivity of our calculated dmc optical excitation energies to the orbital from which the electron is removed in the calculation of the term @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ op ] ) . for the bfd pseudopotential",
    ", we find that ( as expected ) whether the electron is removed from the state with orbitals aligned parallel to the @xmath8 or the @xmath11 axis , our computed excitation energies are not sensitive .",
    "overall , our calculated gaps for zno using the bfd pseudopotential overestimate the experimental value ( 3.4 ev ) by a few tenths of an ev .",
    "these results are in line with self - consistent gw calculations , which find an gw gap of 3.84 ev @xcite , although we should note that non self - consistent gw has a strong sensitivity to the calculation starting point for zno .",
    "the situation is different for the tn pseudopotential , however , for which our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ znooptenergy]a .",
    "the optical excitation energy has been calculated using the same @xmath12 supercells that we used for the bfd pseudopotential .",
    "compared to the bfd results , the trends in the computed tn optical excitations are less clear , and it appears that the finite size effects are not yet completely converged . additionally there is an unexpected sensitivity of the excitation energy to the orbital from which the electron is removed in the calculation of @xmath3 .",
    "the reason for the different trends in fig  [ znooptenergy]a , b is not obvious , but the only difference between the two sets results is the pseudopotentials used for the calculations .",
    "we conclude that the burkatski - fillipi - dolg pseudopotential is better able to describe the optically excited state wave function .",
    "although there may be other differences as well , a key difference between the tn and the bfd pseudopotentials is the size of the core ( ar core vs. ne core ) , so it is possible that the ionic cores may be more largely perturbed for the excited states .",
    "it is interesting that throughout this work the differences between the two pseudopotentials largely arose in the excited state simulations .      in conclusion ,",
    "we have carried out a detailed assessment of errors and uncertainties for the simulation of znse and zno , arising from both controllable and uncontrollable approximations , within the fixed node diffusion monte carlo framework .",
    "we find that the both trail - needs and burkatski - filippi - dolg dirac - fock pseudopotentials do an excellent job of the calculation of the atomization energy .",
    "localization errors introduced by non - local pseudopotentials can be very significant , particularly for pseudopotentials with large cutoff radii .",
    "for the ground state the magnitude of the fixed node error , as assessed by varying the nodes of the trial wave function , is comparatively small .",
    "supercell finite size effects can have a significant effect on calculated ground state energies and extrapolation to the infinite supercell limit appears feasible by sampling supercells up to 16 or 32 atoms in size , particularly with the application of the @xmath13 structure factor correction . when carried out systematically using the approach outlined here , the resulting atomization energies for zno and znse are within 0.1 ev / atom of the experimental value , which is promising for the prediction of stability .",
    "for the calculation of optically excited states , assessment across a variety of supercell sizes and shapes is necessary .",
    "we observe that the computed excitations converge quickly with system size , with a scaling that is probably faster than linear .",
    "we find that the bfd pseudopotential is able to give a good description of the gap of zno .",
    "on the other hand , while the tn pseudopotential performed well for the gap of znse , the results are not as clear for zno .",
    "these observations suggest that differences between pseudopotentials may be more prevalent excited state calculations even if not for the ground state , and that when transition metals are involved , small core pseudopotentials may be important for achieving high accuracy .    the detailed assessment presented here",
    "is expected to be of use to the qmc modeling community , towards the establishment of qmc  best practices \" for the simulations of solid materials .",
    "we also expect this to provide a foundation for further studies that exploit the accuracy available in qmc methods .",
