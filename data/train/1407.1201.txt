    "some real - world problems do not have an exact algorithmic solution .",
    "currently , there is a vast number of artificial intelligence(ai ) methods which can be used to solve them .",
    "one of the branches of ai are artificial neural networks .",
    "they are mathematical models inspired by biology . in 1982",
    "t.kohonen presented architecture called self - organising maps ( som ) @xcite , which provides a method of feature mapping from multi - dimensional space to usually a two - dimensional grid of neurons in an unspervised way .",
    "this way of data analysis was proved as an efficient tool in many applications , both in academic and industrial solutions @xcite .",
    "for example in character recognition tasks , image recognition tasks , face recognition @xcite , analysis of words@xcite , grouping of documents @xcite , visualisation @xcite , and even bioinformatics ( for example phylogenetic tree reconstruction @xcite ) .",
    "there exists a huge number of methods for improving som s performance . some of them concentrated on finding an optimal size of a network@xcite , faster learning @xcite or applying different neighbourhood functions @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate two additional improvements .",
    "the first one @xcite , @xcite uses mahalanobis metric instead of the euclidean one .",
    "the second improvement @xcite shows how to use som in a supervised manner .    in our approach ,",
    "contrary to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , instead of computing the mahalanobis matrix as an inverse of covariance matrix , it is learned in a way assuring the smallest distance between points from the same class and large margin separation of points from different classes .",
    "several algorithms exist for distance metric learning ( dml ) @xcite , @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use so - called large margin nearest neighbour ( lmnn ) method @xcite .",
    "it introduces the distance metric learning problem as a convex optimization , which assures that the global minimum can be efficiently computed .",
    "first , we shortly describe som model used in supervised manner and lmnn method .",
    "then we show how we combine these two approaches into our som+dml model .",
    "finally we present results on real data sets .",
    "let s denote data set as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is an attribute vector of _",
    "i_-th sample , and @xmath2 is a class vector , where @xmath3 for @xmath4 and @xmath5 for @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is class number for _ i_-th sample .      in this paper , we used the som architecture in a supervised manner so - called learning associations by self - organisation ( lasso ) , first described in @xcite .",
    "the main difference between this som architecture and the original kohonen s som architecture @xcite is that during the learning phase the lasso method takes into consideration class vector , additionally to attributes .",
    "herein , we used two - dimensional grid of neurons .",
    "each neuron is represented by a weight vector @xmath8 , consisting of a vector corresponding to attributes @xmath9 , and to a class @xmath10 ( @xmath11 $ ] ) , where @xmath12 are indexes of the neuron in the grid . in a learning phase",
    "all samples are shown to the network in one epoch . for each sample",
    "we search for a neuron which is closest to the _ i_-th sample .",
    "the distance is computed by : @xmath13 the neuron @xmath12 with the smallest distance to _ i_-th sample is called the best matching unit ( bmu ) , we note its indexes as @xmath14 . once the bmu is found , the weight update step is executed .",
    "the weights of each neuron are updated with following formulas : @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a learning coefficient , consisting of a learning step size parameter @xmath18 and a neighbourhood function @xmath19 , so @xmath20 .",
    "learning speed parameter is decreased between consecutive epochs , so that network s ability to remember patterns is improved .",
    "it is described by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a starting value of the learning speed , @xmath23 is the current epoch and @xmath24 is responsible for regulating the speed of the decrease .",
    "neighbourhood function controls changing the weights with respect to the distance to the bmu .",
    "it is noted as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 describes the neighbourhood function width and @xmath27 is the distance in the grid between the neuron and the bmu , computed by the following formula : @xmath28 we assumed a cost function as a sum of distances between samples and corresponding bmus : @xmath29 we train network till the cost function stops decreasing or a selected number of learning procedure iterations is exceed .    the exploitation phase is performed after the learning phase .",
    "new samples , which do not take part in the training , are shown to the network in order to designate their class .",
    "it should be noted that only the part with attributes is presented to the network .",
    "the bmu is found by computing a distance between an attribute input vector and an attribute part of the weights using the following formula : @xmath30 for the tested sample , the designated class corresponds to position of maximum value in the part which code class information @xmath10 in bmu weights .      in many cases",
    "the mostly used metric is an euclidean one .",
    "it often gives poor accuracy , because it takes all dimensions with equal contribution and assumes no correlations between the dimensions .",
    "mahalanobis distance seems a better metric choice , because it is scale - invariant and takes into account input dimensions correlations .",
    "it is defined by : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is usually an inverse of a covariance matrix . in case where @xmath32 is",
    "an identity matrix , the distance ( [ mahal ] ) is equal to the euclidean distance .    in this paper , we learned mahalanobis matrix using the method described in @xcite .",
    "matrix coefficients are computed in a way assuring large margin separation of points from different classes and a small distance between the points of the same class . before starting the matrix learning for each point , @xmath33 nearest neighbours with the same class",
    "are found .",
    "they are called target neighbours , denoted by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 means that @xmath36 is the target neighbour of @xmath37 , and @xmath38 means otherwise . with no prior knowledge",
    ", the euclidean distance can be used to point the target neighbours .",
    "target neighbours are unchanged during the whole learning .",
    "let s add a variable to indicate when the two samples have the same class , denoted as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 when _ i_-th and _",
    "l_-th samples are from the same class , zero when they are from different classes .",
    "finding an optimal matrix @xmath32 can be expressed as a semidefinite programming ( sdp ) optimization problem with the following cost function ( [ cost ] ) and constrains ( [ con1 ] ) , ( [ con2 ] ) , ( [ positive ] ) : @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 the first term in the minimization function penalizes a large distance between the samples and their target neighbours .",
    "the second term penalizes a small distance between the samples from different classes - it is expressed as slack variables @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath46 parameter balances the influence between these two terms . in this paper it is set to @xmath47 , which gives equal strength to each term .",
    "the constraint given in ( [ positive ] ) requires the @xmath32 matrix to be positive semidefinite - all its eigenvalues should be nonnegative .",
    "semidefinite programming is a convex optimization problem , so a global minimum can be efficiently computed .",
    "spd can be solved using general purpose solvers , however  in  our  approach  we  used  matalb implementation code described in @xcite , which is finely tuned to efficiently solve this kind of problems . here most of slack variables are not used because samples are well separated .",
    "we are interested in a such linear transformation of sample attributes that will assure that the euclidean distance computed on the transformed attributes will be equal to the mahalanobis distance computed on the original attributes .",
    "mahalanobis matrix @xmath32 can be written as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the searched transformation .",
    "lets denote @xmath50 as the transformed attributes of _",
    "i_-th sample and @xmath51 as the transformed attributes of _",
    "j_-th sample : @xmath52 @xmath53 the distance between the transformed attributes in euclidean distance should be equal to mahalanobis distance between the original attributes : @xmath54 we will now search for @xmath49 .",
    "now for matrix @xmath32 we will find eigenvectors @xmath55 and a matrix with eigenvalues on diagonal @xmath56 : @xmath57 matrix @xmath56 can be expressed as : @xmath58 since matrix @xmath32 found by the lmnn algorithm is positive semidefine , diagonal elements in matrix @xmath56 are nonnegative .",
    "thus , we can write : @xmath59 substituting ( [ eigenvalue ] ) into ( [ identity ] ) , we obtain : @xmath60 now we can note @xmath49 as : @xmath61 using ( [ el ] ) we can write ( [ m_i ] ) as : @xmath62 we see that @xmath48 and hence we can write : @xmath63 from ( [ ml ] ) we see that ( [ meqe ] ) is true . this transformation of input attributes is also known as _ whitening transform_. it is worth mentioning that , in a transformation phase , only attributes @xmath64 are transformed , the class part of input vector @xmath65 is unchanged",
    ". therefore , even though the data were pre - processed using the @xmath49 transformation , we still can use the original som algorithm .",
    "performance of the som+dml method was compared to the som model on six real data sets . as an accuracy measure we take the percentage of incorrect classifications .",
    "it is worth mentioning that getting the highest number of correct classifications is not the goal of this paper .",
    "data sets are described in table [ sets ] .",
    "sets wine , ionosphere , iris , isolet , digits are sets from the uci machine learing repository , set faces are from the the orl database of faces.    now we briefly introduce the origin of the sets .",
    "data sets wine , ionosphere , iris are classic benchmark sets , often used in testing newly developed classification algorithms . isolet data set represents a spoken letter recognition task .",
    "its samples correspond to 26 letters of the alphabet .",
    "the original number of attributes ( 617 ) was projected by pca to 100 principal components , which covers @xmath66 of its variance .",
    "digits data set represents a handwritten digit recognition problem .",
    "the samples are from 10 classes obtained from 43 people .",
    "original images were 32x32 bitmaps downsampled to 64 attributes by creators . the face recognition task is presented by data set faces. it contains images of faces obtained from 40 people ( 40 classes ) . for each person",
    "10 images were taken in different times , varying lightening , changing facial expressions and details .",
    "the original data - 92x112 pixels images in 256 gray levels was projected by pca to 50 leading components ( @xmath67 of variance ) , the so - called egienfaces method@xcite .",
    "each data set , if not originally divided to train / test subsets , was randomly divided by us - @xmath68 of data to training subset and @xmath69 to testing subset .",

    "for all data sets , the following values of the learning parameters were used : @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 . for each data set a number of @xmath33 target neighbours in the lmnn algorithm was selected using cross validation with ten times repetition .",
