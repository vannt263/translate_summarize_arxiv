    "high-@xmath1 superconductivity ( sc ) has been in the forefront of condensed - matter physics research since its discovery in the cuprates over 23 years ago .",
    "this system is characterized by anomalous behavior of many of its physical properties @xcite which led to the suggestion of non - fermi - liquid ( non - fl ) models @xcite for its electronic structure .",
    "the recent discovery of high-@xmath1 sc in iron - based compounds ( referred to below as fescs ) , provides a new test case for high-@xmath1 theories , especially in view @xcite of the striking similarity of their anomalous properties to those of the cuprates .",
    "recently , a unified theory for the cuprates and the fescs has been derived @xcite on the basis of common features in their electronic structures , including quasi - two - dimensionality , and the large-@xmath4 nature of the electron orbitals close to the fermi level ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "electrons of such orbitals _ can not _ be treated through a mean - field independent - particle approach ; therefore , their behavior is studied in terms of auxiliary particles , representing combinations of atomic - like electron configurations .    within this auxiliary - particles method @xcite , configurations in sites",
    "@xmath6 can be , approximately , treated as bosons or fermions , if each site is mathematically constrained to be occupied by one ( and only one ) configuration .",
    "there is a freedom in choosing configurations of an odd number of electrons as fermions , and of an even number of electrons as bosons , or _",
    "vice versa _ @xcite .",
    "the choice here is that configurations corresponding to undoped cuprates or fescs ( thus the parent compounds ) are bosons .",
    "these auxiliary particles have been treated _ beyond _ mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "a grand - canonical hamiltonian @xmath7 has been written down @xcite , where ( in addition to the chemical potential @xmath8 ) a field of lagrange multipliers @xmath9 was introduced ( @xmath10 ) to maintain the above auxiliary - particles constraint .",
    "this lagrange field represents an effective fluctuating potential which enables the treatment of the above configurations as bosons or fermions ; its effect on them is analogous to the effect of vibrating atoms on electrons , and similarly to lattice dynamics , this is a bose field @xcite ( see discussion about it below ) .",
    "these auxiliary particles are assigned the following _ ad hoc _ names @xcite : ( _ i _ ) combinations of boson atomic - like configurations are referred to as `` svivons '' ; their bose condensation results in static or dynamical inhomogeneities which could be manifested in the existence of a commensurate or an incommensurate resonance mode @xcite ; ( _ ii _ ) combinations of fermion atomic - like configurations are referred to as `` quasi - electrons '' ( qes ) ; they carry charge @xmath11 and are introduced through electron or hole doping ( in the second case the configurations correspond to holes of qes ) ; ( _ iii _ ) the lagrange - field bosons are referred to as `` lagrons '' , and their coupling to the svivons and qes provides a dynamical enforcement of the auxiliary - particles constraint",
    ".    stripe - like inhomogeneities have been observed @xcite within the phase diagram of the cuprates . even though such an inhomogeneous behavior is often dynamical within the sc regime , it is not treated here as a perturbation to a homogeneous state , but as a correction to a static inhomogeneous structure .",
    "the application of the constraint , approached here through the lagrange field , must take into account the existence of these inhomogeneities .",
    "this results in a multi - component scenario .    in small-@xmath4 systems , where low - energy electrons are appropriate quasiparticles ( qps ) ,",
    "the flex approximation @xcite could be applied @xcite to derive an effective pairing interaction between them , due to their own spin and charge fluctuations .",
    "the low - energy large-@xmath4 electrons , discussed here , _",
    "can not _ be considered as appropriate qps ; but their description in terms of independent auxiliary fermi and bose fields provides an intrinsic pairing mechanism through qe - lagron coupling ; it can be treated @xcite within the migdal  eliashberg theory @xcite , similarly to electron - phonon coupling in the case of phonon - induced pairing , but with coupling constants which are so strong that lattice instabilities would have been driven in the electron - phonon case .    in this",
    "paper auxiliary particles which are specific for the cuprates are introduced , and their green s functions are applied to derive those of the electrons .",
    "the detailed qe and electron spectral functions are calculated , with further emphasis on the anomalous low - energy features .",
    "the qe , svivon and electron scattering rates are derived in the non - fl regime , and the resulting physical anomalies are discussed .",
    "@xmath7 is then applied to derive qe and electron pairing which is demonstrated to result in the distinct pseudogap ( pg ) and sc phases ; the associated anomalous physical behavior is discussed .",
    "further calculations on part of these aspects ( specifically in the paired states ) will appear in separate papers .",
    "electronic - structure calculations , and a variety of experimental data , indicate that the `` universal '' ( thus _ not _ characteristic of just specific compounds ) low - energy properties of the cuprates are primarily determined by cu(@xmath12 ) and o(@xmath13 ) orbitals of the cuo@xmath14 planes . within the lda",
    ", these orbitals generate a multiple - band structure extending over a range of @xcite about @xmath15ev .",
    "however , the electronic states at the vicinity of @xmath5 dominantly reside @xcite in _ one _ of these bands , of wannier functions @xcite which are centered at the planar cu atoms , and correspond mainly to @xmath16-antibonding states between cu(@xmath17 ) and o(@xmath18 ) orbitals ( though a minor contribution of other orbitals exists as well ) . due to this orbital nature of the band ,",
    "its treatment requires effective transfer ( hopping ) integrals up to the third - nearest neighbor ( see below ) .",
    "the effective intra - site coulomb parameter @xmath4 , for electrons in this band , corresponds to its wannier functions which are , primarily , combinations of cu(@xmath12 ) and o(@xmath13 ) functions . estimates of @xmath4 must take into account the fact that the @xmath12 intra - atomic integral @xmath19 is considerably larger than the @xmath13 integral @xmath20 . in an early derivation of the effective one - band hamiltonian @xcite in hole - doped cuprates , the large-@xmath19 and small-@xmath20 limits have been assumed , resulting in approximately ionic cu(@xmath12 ) and itinerant o(@xmath13 ) states .",
    "the resulting @xcite upper hubbard band corresponds to cu@xmath21 ions , and the lower hubbard band to cu@xmath22 ions , part of which are forming singlet states with the doped o(@xmath13 ) holes ( known as `` zhang - rice singlets '' ) .",
    "consequently , the value of @xmath4 , derived through this analysis , consists of @xmath19 plus corrections , due to the singlet energy and the difference between the one - electron @xmath13 and @xmath12 energies which are considered to be substantially smaller .",
    "a more realistic evaluation of @xmath4 would result in a somewhat smaller value than @xmath19 ; however , since the width of the effective band , within a two - dimensional ( 2d ) brillouin zone ( bz ) , is @xcite about @xmath23ev , it is appropriate to treat it using a large-@xmath4 approach .    within this one - band approach , a 2d square lattice of @xmath24 sites @xmath6",
    "is considered ( assuming translational symmetry between them ) ; the cu atoms are located at the lattice points @xmath25 , generated by the unit vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",

    "this approach is _ different _ from homogeneous rvb models @xcite which are also based on auxiliary particles , but generally within the `` slave - boson '' method , where the fermions are spin - carrying `` spinons '' and the bosons are charge - carrying `` holons '' . within the present approach , the roles of fermions and bosons are switched , and consequently inhomogeneities are inherently introduced through bose condensation .",
