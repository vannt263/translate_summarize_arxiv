    "self - assembled semiconductor nanowires have attracted a lot of attention recently due to their well - defined crystalline structure , unique electrical and optical properties , as well as a promising outlook for their use as building blocks in nanoelectronics , nanospintronics and nanobiotechnology  @xcite .",
    "rapid developments in material science and technology have enabled the realization of nanowires from many materials and materials combinations , such as iii - v semiconductors ( e.g. , gaas  @xcite , inp  @xcite , inas  @xcite ) , ii - vi semiconductors ( e.g. , cdse  @xcite , cds  @xcite , cdte  @xcite , znte  @xcite ) , as well as si  @xcite and ge  @xcite . by",
    "now it is possible to dope nanowires  @xcite and perform heterostructure engineering with atomic precision  @xcite .",
    "this enabled the realization of _",
    "p_-type  @xcite or ambipolar  @xcite transport characteristics , as well as the fabrication of nanostructures ( quantum dots  @xcite , rods  @xcite , and superlattices  @xcite ) . based on these material - science developments , devices such as nanowire diodes  @xcite , superlattices for nanoscale photonics and electronics  @xcite ,",
    "lasers  @xcite , resonant tunneling diodes  @xcite , and light - emitting diodes  @xcite , have been demonstrated .",
    "another area of significant research that has emerged in recent years focuses on the study of the spin degree of freedom .",
    "this is relevant for the fundamental understanding of spin phenomena in solid - state systems , but also for potential applications that utilize the spin , rather than the charge degree of freedom , in electronics  @xcite .",
    "spin injection , manipulation and detection has been achieved with the use of magnetic fields and diluted magnetic semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "a complementary direction of current spin - electronics research is based on the quantum - mechanical coupling between spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , the tunability of structural inversion - asymmetry induced spin - orbit ( so ) coupling  @xcite could be used to manipulate spin - polarized currents in ballistic mesoscopic channels  @xcite .    to study so effects in semiconductors , charge carriers from the valence band ( i.e. , holes ) are particularly interesting since they are subject to an inherently strong so coupling even in the bulk . in addition , as valence - band states are predominantly @xmath1-like ( i.e. , have orbital angular momentum @xmath2 ) , they are characterized by a total angular momentum of either @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "the topmost valence bands are described by the former ; thus they behave like spin-3/2 particles and , when confined in nanostructures , exhibit quite counterintuitive quantum effects .",
    "for example , the spin-3/2 nature of the topmost valence bands leads to large anisotropies of the hole @xmath0 factor in quantum wells  @xcite , wires  @xcite , point contacts  @xcite , quantum dots@xcite , and localized acceptor states  @xcite .",
    "valence bands are split due to quantum confinement , e.g. , in a two - dimensional hole gas .",
    "[ fig : disp],width=192 ]    the bulk dispersions for the conduction and valence bands of a typical semiconductor in zero magnetic field are shown as the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] .",
    "the four - fold degeneracy of the @xmath3 valence - band edges is lifted at finite wave vector @xmath5  @xcite , giving rise to separated heavy - hole ( hh ) and light - hole ( lh ) branches whose states are distinguished by the @xmath6-axis spin-3/2 projection quantum numbers @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "size quantization , e.g. , due to a quantum - well confinement , causes an energy splitting between the quasi - twodimensional ( 2d ) hh and 2d lh band edges  @xcite .",
    "this hh - lh _ splitting _ is illustrated by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] . at finite wave vector @xmath9 for motion perpendicular to the quantum - well growth direction",
    ", a hh - lh _ mixing _ occurs that can give rise to level anticrossings  @xcite , further increasing the complexity of holes electronic properties .",
    "while in 2d systems the hh - lh mixing is absent at the subband edge and can be assumed to have a small magnitude for finite @xmath10 in the presence of strong quantum confinement  @xcite , this is not the case for hole nanowires  @xcite and quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "previous studies of the topmost hole - nanowire eigenstates have shown that they are , to a varying degree , mixtures of hh and lh states  @xcite .",
    "this has been found to influence , e.g. , the spin splitting in cylindrical hole nanowires with hard - wall confinement@xcite and nanosized clusters.@xcite    in this article , we present an extensive theoretical study of the electronic structure of hole nanowires , focusing especially on the importance of hh - lh mixing and splitting . furthermore , we have investigated the ramifications of the spin-3/2 nature of holes for the spin splitting of hole nanowire states , in particular elucidating the interplay between the bulk - material and bound - state orbital effects due to a magnetic field .",
    "we use the luttinger description  @xcite of the semiconductor valence band to study the subband edges ( @xmath11 ) of hole nanowires oriented along the @xmath6 direction . in order to quantitatively analyze the strength of hh - lh mixing at the subband edge states , we make use of scalar invariants obtainable from a decomposition of the spin-3/2 density matrix in terms of a multipole expansion  @xcite . the squared dipole moment , which apart from a prefactor is a measure of the squared magnitude of the hole - spin polarization , is by its definition @xcite independent of the quantization axis of the angular momentum used in the basis functions of the hole subband edge state .",
    "thus , it provides a rigorous , basis - independent way of characterizing the hole - spin polarization character of hole subband edge states .",
    "we present a comprehensive analysis of the hole - spin polarization character of hole subband edge states in nanowires with different confining potentials .",
    "the strong hh - lh mixing manifests as large spatial variations in the hole - spin polarization density profile of individual subband states .",
    "furthermore , we observe large differences between the hole - spin polarization density profiles of different subband states .",
    "we also find that the topmost hole subband edges in general display universal features that are robust against changes of the confining potential s symmetry . for hole subband edge states that are far away from the bulk valence band edge , however , differences in the strength and shape of the confining potential significantly affect the wavefunction s hole - spin polarization .    a direct manifestation of the strong hh - lh mixing ( and splitting ) in hole nanowires",
    "is observed in the spin splitting due to a finite magnetic field .",
    "we use perturbative and numerical calculations to show that , in a magnetic field applied parallel to the wire axis , the effective @xmath0 factor varies strongly between different wire subband edges .",
    "we analyze the separate contributions to the @xmath0 factor arising from bulk - material and orbital bound - state interactions with the magnetic field .",
    "we find that the hole envelope functions acquire large orbital momentum due to the imposed quantum confinement , which strongly affects the effective @xmath0 factor of hole nanowire states .",
    "interestingly , the bulk - material and bound - state contributions can come with the same or opposite sign , thus effectively enhancing or suppressing each other s contribution to the total spin splitting .",
    "we also find that the interplay between the two contributions is very sensitive to the hole wave function , and thus , that the @xmath0 factor of individual wire states can be tuned by changing the confining potential .",
    "for example , we show that by changing the aspect ratio of the lateral dimensions of a wire with rectangular crossection , one can tune the magnitude and even the sign of the @xmath0 factor quite sensitively .",
    "such a situation can , in principle , be easily realized by tuning the lateral confinement via side gates in self - assembled@xcite or lithographically defined nanowires@xcite , or quantum point contacts@xcite .",
    "quasi - onedimensional ( 1d ) hole systems thus provide an interesting laboratory for the study of spin-3/2 physics , as well as have the potential for being building blocks in hole - spintronics applications .    in the following ,",
    "we start by presenting the basic theoretical formalism for describing hole - nanowire states in the absence of a magnetic field within the luttinger model ( sec .  [ theory ] ) .",

    "<S> we present a detailed theoretical study of the electronic spectrum and zeeman splitting in hole quantum wires . the spin-3/2 character of the topmost bulk - valence - band states results in a strong variation of subband - edge @xmath0 factors between different subbands . </S>",
    "<S> we elucidate the interplay between quantum confinement and heavy - hole    light - hole mixing and identify a certain robustness displayed by low - lying hole - wire subband edges with respect to changes in the shape or strength of the wire potential . </S>",
    "<S> the ability to address individual subband edges in , e.g. , transport or optical experiments enables the study of holes states with nonstandard spin polarization , which do not exist in spin-1/2 systems . changing the aspect ratio of hole wires with rectangular cross - section turns out to strongly affect the @xmath0 factor of subband edges , providing an opportunity for versatile in - situ tuning of hole - spin properties with possible application in spintronics . </S>",
    "<S> the relative importance of cubic crystal symmetry is discussed , as well as the spin splitting away from zone - center subband edges . </S>"
