    "the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) are a goldmine of cosmological information .",
    "they tell us about the state of the universe at the age of a few hundred thousand years ( redshift @xmath2 ) , when the primeval plasma combined into neutral atoms and became transparent , unveiling the small fluctuations that would eventually form the large  scale structure of the present  day universe .",
    "these small inhomogeneities provide the cosmologist with a ( relatively ) direct link between observable and theoretical quantities , so that accurate measurements of the anisotropies can be used to constrain fundamental parameters of the standard big bang cosmology , at least within the adopted theoretical framework . for the case of inflation ",
    "generated perturbations , this approach directly constrains the spatial geometry of the universe , the physical particle densities ( such as the baryon or dark matter density ) , the form of the primeval perturbation spectrum ( scalar and tensor modes ) , and the ionization history since recombination .",
    "a large international effort has set as its goal high precision measurements of the cmb anisotropies , employing numerous ground  based , balloon and space  borne projects ; among the latter wmap , launched by nasa in 2001 , and planck to be launched in 2007 by esa .    the archeops experiment is , with the wmap space ",
    "borne mission , one of the few sensitive instruments mapping a large fraction of the sky in a large range of observing wavelengths .",
    "in addition to measuring the cmb power spectrum , archeops data provides a survey of astrophysical emissions between 150 and 550 ghz over more than 30% of the sky .",
    "the corresponding multifrequency maps can be used for a variety of applications .",
    "at the time of archeops preliminary design studies in 1997 - 1998 , several sensitive ground based and balloon  borne instruments dedicated to middle  range cmb power spectrum measurement were already in operating status .",
    "most of these experiments observed small regions of the sky as free as possible from galactic foregrounds , yielding measurements of the spectrum on degree angular sizes and smaller , at @xmath3 . on the other hand , the cobe - dmr space ",
    "borne instrument had yielded a measurement of the cmb power spectrum at very large scales , on angular scales larger than 10 degrees or so . a sensitive instrument capable of measuring the spectrum on a wide angular scale range from @xmath4 to the second acoustic peak was missing .",
    "a few experiments were designed for this purpose , among which archeops , which measured the first acoustic peak from @xmath5 to @xmath6 quite accurately in 2002 and the wmap mission , which provided us early 2003 with a very accurate measurement of the cmb power spectrum , from the dipole to the rise of the third acoustic peak .",
    "wmap and archeops together provide us with sensitive maps of a large common fraction of sky of more than 30% in nine frequency channels ranging from 22 to 550 ghz .",
    "archeops is designed as an intermediate angular scales cmb mission based on the technology developed for the planck hfi .",
    "web bolometers , cooled down to 100 mk thanks to an open cycle @xmath7he@xmath8he dilution fridge , are placed at the focal plane of a 1.3meter gregorian off - axis telescope pointed at a 41degree elevation . for sensitivity in a low background environment as well as minimization of atmospheric contamination ,",
    "the instrument is flown on a stratospheric balloon .",
    "the beams of the instrument are scanned on the sky by rotating the gondola around a vertical axis during the flight .",
    "the mission objectives of the archeops instrument require a large sky coverage for low @xmath9 sensitivity , and a 10arcminute angular resolution for sensitivity to small angular scales .",
    "in addition , the necessity to cover a large fraction of the sky requires a long duration night - time flight , avoiding systematics and stray signals from the sun and the moon while spending enough time in each sub  degree pixel . for science flights ,",
    "archeops is launched by cnes from the esrange base near kiruna in sweden during the polar arctic night .",
    "typical wind speeds , power supply from batteries , and the autonomy of the archeops cryostat permit flight durations of up to 36 hours .",
    "the archeops scanning strategy consists in spinning the gondola at 2 rpm while letting the sky drift overheads .",
    "circular scan trajectories shift on the sky during the flight , yielding a large sky coverage of interconnected scans .",
    "theoretical studies carried on the analysis of cmb data on circular scans @xcite demonstrate that it is possible to remove most of the unwanted effects of timeline slow drifts for such a scan strategy .",
    "when scans are well connected , the redundancy provided by scan crossings permit the removal of slow drifts in a map  making step .",
    "when they are not , a low - cut filter is applied to the data and accounted for in the spectral estimation step .",
    "the archeops detectors are spider  web bolometers similar in design to those of planck hfi , boomerang and maxima .",
    "these detectors have been developed by jpl / caltech as part of the planck hfi development .",
    "these bolometers have high responsivity , low nep , fast speed of response and a low cross section to cosmic ray hits .",
    "the bolometers are made by micro - machining silicon nitride to leave a self - supported , metallized spider web mesh absorber . a neutron ",
    "transmutation  doped ge : ga thermistor is bonded at the web center to sense the temperature rise which results from the absorption of radiation @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the archeops telescope is a two mirror , off - axis , tilted gregorian telescope consisting of a parabolic primary and an elliptical secondary .",
    "radiation from the telescope is focussed into the entrance of a back  to  back horn pair .",
    "a lens at the exit aperture of the second horn creates a beam  waist where wavelength selective filters are placed .",
    "a second lens on the front of the third horn maintains beam control and focuses the radiation onto the spider bolometer placed at the exit aperture .",
    "the focal plane is cooled to 100  mk by an open cycle dilution refrigerator designed at the crtbt ( centre de recherche sur les trs basses tempratures ) in grenoble ( france ) @xcite .",
    "the dilution stage is placed in a low temperature box placed on a liquid helium reservoir at 4.2  k. a heat exchanger using exhaust vapours from the helium tank maintains the horns near 10k .      a custom star sensor , fast enough to work on a payload rotating at 23 rpm , has been developed for pointing reconstruction .",
    "a linear array of 46 sensitive photodiodes , placed in the focal plane of a 40  cm diameter , 1.8  m focal length parabolic optical mirror , scan the sky along a circle at an elevation of @xmath10 .",
    "an algorithm treats independent photodiode data streams to detect bright star triggers , and matches the detected stars against a star catalogue for pointing reconstruction .",
    "in addition to the fast star sensor , gyroscopes give information about balloon pendulation , and a magnetometer gives phase information from the flux of the earth magnetic field .",
    "both informations can be used to help the pointing reconstruction algorithm .",
    "the constant offset between bolometer and stellar sensor pointing directions on the sky is calibrated on jupiter crossings .",
    "the archeops experiment has been launched successfully three times .",
    "a first test flight was made from trapani in july 1999 with an early version of the experiment @xcite .",
    "two successful scientific flights were made from kiruna in january 2001 and february 2002 .",

    "right : adding hst prior for @xmath12 . ]",
    "table [ table_param ] gives the constrains on cosmological parameters with the data sets archeops+cmb and archeops+cmb+hst .",
    "some results are also presented as 2-d contour plots on figure [ contour_cosmo ] , showing in shades of blue the regions where the likelihood function for a combination of any two parameters drops to 68% , 95% and 99% of its maximum value .",
    "black contours mark the limits to be projected if confidence intervals are sought for any one of the two parameters .    note that considering archeops+cmb data , a strong degeneracy remains , that is well broken when adding the hst prior on the hubble constant .",
    "the tight constrain on @xmath13 , at 3% level , is compatible with the hypothesis of flatness of the universe , and the constrain on @xmath14 is compatible with the hypothesis that the primordial fluctuations are nearly scale - invariant .",
    "these results lend support to the inflationary paradigm .",
    "note also that the constraints on @xmath15 and @xmath16 agree well with the results of the supernovae ia @xcite and big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite , with a different approach and systematic effects .",
    "more details can be found in the archeops paper @xcite .      the measurement of the cmb polarization spectra , since the pioneering works of dasi @xcite and wmap @xcite , has now become the major experimental goal in the field . for high frequency cmb experiments ,",
    "the major foreground to remove is the emission of the galactic interstellar dust .",
    "its intensity can be inferred from iras and cobe / dirbe extrapolations @xcite , but nothing is known on its polarization on scales larger than 10 arcminutes . as",
    "these scales are the relevant ones for cmb polarization studies , the determination of the maps of the galactic interstellar dust polarization can be seen as a mandatory preliminary step .    to achieve this goal , archeops uses three pairs of polarized bolometers at 353 ghz , a frequency in which the galaxy dominates .",
    "within each pair , each bolometer observes the same point of the sky , the separation of the incoming light in two orthogonal polarization directions is made by an ortho mode transducer @xcite@xcite .",
    "maps of the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 stokes parameters over 17% of the sky and with 13 arcmin resolution have been obtained , with a sensitivity at @xmath20 per 27 arcminute pixel of 82 @xmath21 for i , and 105 @xmath21 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the results and their implications are presented in @xcite .",
    "a dust polarisation of about 56 % is found in the galactic plane on average , and as much as 1520 % in a few extended clouds .",
    "the recent measurement of the power spectrum of the cmb anisotropies with the wmap space mission makes the archeops measurement of the @xmath22 as published obsolete .",
    "archeops , however , remains complementary to wmap because it covers a large fraction of the sky in a complementary frequency domain .",
    "this opens the possibility of combining wmap and archeops for a wide multi ",
    "frequency study of astrophysical emissions in the millimeter range .",
    "it is not planned at the moment to fly archeops again as it is .",
    "more sensitive instruments for cmb studies are operational ( as wmap ) or in construction ( the planck mission ) , so that the scientific objectives of archeops future flights have to be revised .",
    "two interesting possibilities are being investigated .",
    "the first is complementing the sky and frequency coverage available to the scientific community ( more sky with archeops at frequencies complementary to wmap ) .",
    "the second would be to measure large scale polarisation , and in particular confirm at 150 and 217 ghz the wmap measurement of a high @xmath23 cross power spectrum .",
    "the archeops experiment , flown succesfully three times from 1999 to 2002 , has gathered a large amount of high quality data .",
    "the data , currently being analysed , has already yielded a good measurement of the cmb anisotropy power spectrum in the angular scale range of the first acoustic peak .      much more",
    "is still being expected from archeops data . in particular ,",
    "high quality large size maps of sky emission in the four archeops channels , as well as maps of astrophysical components , are expected to be released in a near future .",
    "combined to other data as maps from the wmap , from iras , and from cobe , these data products will be a precious tool to further our understanding of sky emission in the millimeter range ."
