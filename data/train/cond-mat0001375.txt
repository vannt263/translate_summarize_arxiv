    "one of the fascinating consequences of superconductivity is the phenomenon of andreev scattering at a normal metal / superconductor ( ns ) junction .",
    "this corresponds to an incoming electron from the normal side being reflected back as a hole , thereby producing an additional cooper pair in the superconductor condensate .",
    "both normal and andreev reflections are expected to occur in a realistic ns junction , in addition to quasiparticle transmission into the superconductor .",
    "if the gap is large enough , the latter s propagation is suppressed and squared reflection amplitudes add up to one through probability current conservation . building up on andreev reflection ,",
    "one arrives at the related phenomenon of the josephson current , in which the normal region of an sns junctions carries a supercurrent driven by the gap phase difference between left and right superconductors .",
    "while the original work in this field@xcite treated the normal metal within the fermi liquid framework ( _ i.e. _ essentially ignored interactions ) , the effect of interactions for the case of a one - dimensional metal between two superconductors has been treated recently by several groups@xcite using bosonization and renormalization group methods . the methods and conclusions of these works are closely related to previous work on tunnelling through a single impurity in a quantum wire.@xcite    we have chosen to re - examine this subject in both non - interacting and interacting cases because we feel that previous treatments have missed some interesting physics . in particular , most of the standard work on the non - interacting case has essentially ignored band structure effects , using a free electron model with a pairing potential that varies abruptly accross the junction , together with a scattering potential at the interface . a more recent paper@xcite considers the case where the fermi velocity is different on the s and n side .",
    "the conclusion of this work is that , at the fermi energy , there is perfect andreev reflection ( and therefore 0 normal reflection ) when the scattering potential and velocity mismatch are absent .",
    "both of these effects serve to increase the normal scattering amplitude in an additive way .",
    "we arrive at qualitatively different conclusions by explicitly including band structure in the form of an exactly solveable one - dimensional tight - binding model with hamiltonian : @xmath1 \\label{ifh}.\\ ] ] the chemical potential , @xmath2 , is assumed to lie within the band on the normal side @xmath3 and @xmath4 stands for hermitean conjugate . here the interface is chosen to lie between sites 0 and 1 with the superconductor on the negative @xmath5-axis and the normal metal on the positive @xmath5 axis so that : @xmath6 @xmath7 represents the pairing interaction which exists on the superconducting side ( @xmath8 ) only . for simplicity",
    "we consider both normal and superconducting sides to be one - dimensional , but see below .",
    "the notion of a `` perfect junction '' becomes less clear in such a model . in the particle - hole symmetric case , @xmath9 , we find that there is always some normal scattering at the fermi energy unless the interface tunnelling parameter , @xmath10 , is fine - tuned to a particular value . in the limit @xmath11 ,",
    "this particular value becomes @xmath12 for general values of the chemical potential we find that both @xmath10 and the normal scattering intensity , @xmath13 , must be fine - tuned in order to achieve perfect andreev reflection .",
    "we emphasise that these conclusions seem to be different than the previous ones obtained without explicit consideration of band effects .",
    "for example , in the particle - hole symmetric case it is possible to get perfect andreev reflection even with fermi velocity mismatch ( @xmath14 ) provided that @xmath10 is adjusted to the right value .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the case of infinite interface tunnelling : @xmath15 _ does not _ correspond to perfect andreev reflection as one might naively suppose , but instead to zero andreev reflection .",
    "the physical reason is that , in this limit , two electrons get trapped at the interface on sites 0 and 1 , effectively decoupling all sites with @xmath16 from all sites with @xmath17 . in this limit",
    "the normal side does not `` feel ''",
    "the pairing and hence exhibits no andreev reflection .",
    "we are not aware of any previous explicit calculation of the josephson current for such an interface model which we perform here .",
    "we consider two , possibly different , interfaces separated by a distance of @xmath18 lattice sites with the pairing potentials having a phase difference @xmath19 .",
    "the ( zero temperature ) josephson current is defined from the derivative of the groundstate energy with respect to this phase difference : @xmath20 while the groundstate energy is obtained by summing over all states below the fermi surface , we show explicitly that its derivative with respect to @xmath19 only depends on quantities defined at the fermi surface , being insensitive to the details of the band structure .",
    "when the junction parameters are fine - tuned to give perfect andreev reflection we find that the josephson current is a sawtooth function of @xmath19 : @xmath21 with steps of size @xmath22 occurring at @xmath23 .",
    "for any other choice of junction parameters the josephson current is a smooth function of @xmath19 .",
    "for example , in the limit of a weak junction , @xmath24 , we find : @xmath25 while these formulas are well - known results , our method in fact allows us to calculate exactly the zero - temperature josephson current in the general case of arbitrary amounts of normal versus andreev reflection , independently at each boundary .",
    "the full crossover between the above two limits is thus described .",
    "one approach which we shall make much use of in this paper is that of an effective field theory , whereby the superconducting side is replaced by a particular boundary contribution on the normal side .",
    "there are several reasons why it is convenient to `` integrate out '' the electrons on the superconducting side of the junction in such a way as to obtain an effective hamiltonian for the electrons on the normal side .",
    "this is a very natural thing to do considering the fact that the superconducting electrons have a gap in their spectrum : if we consider physics at energy scales small compared to the gap we expect to obtain a simple effective action without any retarded interactions .",
    "( this may break down for non s - wave pairing where the gap vanishes in certain directions ; we do not consider that case here . )",
    "the resulting effective hamiltonian ( for a single junction ) is : @xmath26+\\left [ \\delta_b \\psi^\\dagger_{1,\\uparrow}\\psi^\\dagger_{1,\\downarrow}+h.c.\\right]+v_b\\psi^\\dagger_{1\\sigma } \\psi_{1\\sigma}.\\label{heff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the effective boundary pairing interaction , @xmath27 and effective boundary scattering potential , @xmath28 , depend on all the parameters of the superconductor and the junction , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath10 , @xmath13 .",
    "beginning from our interface model of eq .",
    "( [ ifh ] ) we determine explicitly the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 of the boundary model and check that low energy properties are faithfully reproduced .",
    "of course , we again find with the boundary pairing model that perfect andreev reflection only occurs if the boundary parameters are fine - tuned .",
    "in particular , for the particle - hole symmetric case , @xmath31 , the condition is : @xmath32 note that is is _ not _ @xmath33 as one might naively suppose .",
    "one advantage of the boundary model is that it should arise from much more general , and more realistic , interface models . while the simple form of eq .",
    "( [ ifh ] ) , quadratic in fermion operators , is the result of a mean field approximation to a more realistic model with pairing or electron - phonon interactions on the superconducting side , we expect that the effective hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) will still be valid at energies small compared to the gap when the interactions on the superconducting side are treated more accurately .",
    "furthermore , it is more or less obvious that the same effective hamiltonian arises when the one - dimensional normal metal is coupled to a three - dimensional superconductor .",
    "this is an important generalization since superconductivity is not believed to occur in a strictly one - dimensional system .",
    "more generally we wish to add interactions to our hamiltonian on the normal side which we assume to be one - dimensional .",
    "a simple choice would be an onsite ( hubbard ) interaction for all sites @xmath34 : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the total electron number operator at site @xmath37 .",
    "we could also consider longer range density - density interactions .",
    "we will be interested in the case of both repulsive and attractive bulk interactions ; the latter may arise in a low energy effective theory from phonon exchange .",
    "the negative @xmath38 hubbard model has a gap for spin excitations which can be eliminated by considering longer range interactions .",
    "we will discuss both cases with zero and non - zero spin gap .",
    "these interactions can be treated essentially exactly , at low energies , using bosonization , renormalization group and conformal field theory techniques .",
    "it is a major purpose of this paper to discuss how to generalize these techniques to the interface model .",
    "we argue that this is best done by integrating out the superconducting electrons to obtain the boundary model of eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) with the bulk interactions , @xmath39 added .",
    "( more generally , we might also obtain additional interactions at the boundary .",
    "these can be treated in the same framework . )",
    "indeed , this approach seems to be more or less forced upon us by the renormalization group philosophy of integrating out high energy modes to obtain an effective low energy hamiltonian .",
    "having performed the initial step of integrating out the gapped degrees of freedom on the superconducting side we may then proceed to analyse the effective hamiltonian with bulk and boundary terms using general methods developed to deal with quantum impurity problems.@xcite of course , our results will only be valid at energies @xmath0 .",
    "the boundary renormalization group approach leads to the conclusion that the boundary interactions will renormalize to a fixed point corresponding to a conformally invariant boundary condition .",
    "it appears likely that there are only two such boundary conditions that occur in this problem , in the particle - hole symmetric case ( @xmath40 ) corresponding to a free boundary condition ( b.c . ) , @xmath41 which preserves electron number and therefore has no andreev reflection and to an `` andreev boundary condition '' for which there is perfect andreev reflection . which of these boundary conditions is stable under renormalization group transformations depends on the sign of the bulk interactions , @xmath38 .",
    "we find that the free b.c .",
    "is stable for repulsive bulk interactions but the andreev b.c .",
    "is stable for attractive bulk interactions ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "we calculate the various critical exponents associated with these critical points .",
    "it is important to realize that critical exponents are characteristic of a particular fixed point and are different at the free and andreev fixed points .",
    "thus , for instance with repulsive bulk interactions , if we started with bare interface parameters that put the interface close to the andreev fixed point then the exponents characterizing the initial flow away from the andreev fixed point at high temperature are different than the exponents characterizing the flow towards the free fixed point at low temperature .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that for a generic choice of bare interface parameters the hamiltonian will not be near the andreev fixed point ; this requires fine - tuning .",
    "the situation is similar in the non particle - hole symmetric case except we now get lines of fixed points with either @xmath43 or perfect andreev reflection .    the first work that we are aware of on andreev scattering in tomonaga - luttinger liquids@xcite attempted to apply boundary rg techniques without explicitly intergrating out the superconducting side and without taking into account the effect of the b.c.s on the exponents .",
    "this led to incorrect predictions for the exponent governing the josephson current .",
    "[ ] used a method closely related to ours but applied it to a different geometry : a closed normal ring in contact with superconductors at two points .",
    "takane@xcite corrected some of the earlier result in [ ] for the exponent governing the josephson current using methods essentially equivalent to ours but without explicitly invoking the concept of integrating out the superconducting side .",
    "we extend takane s result by introducing the conceptually important and very useful notion of integrating out the superconducting electrons thus making clear the relationship between the interface problem , other quantum impurity problems and boundary conformal field theory .",
    "this facilitates a more general discussion of the universal critical behaviour .",
    "in particular we discuss the behaviour of the josephson current in the vicinity of the andreev fixed point , obtaining quite different results than those in [ ] , and discussing how the functional dependence of the current on the superconducting phase difference crosses over between sawtooth and smooth forms .    given the difficulty of achieving perfect andreev scattering in the non - interacting case our conclusion is quite remarkable that , with attractive bulk interactions , a generic interface will renormalize to perfect andreev scattering as @xmath44 .",
    "it must be admitted that this conclusion is based on an unproven but widely made assumption about rg flows and fixed points in the boundary sine - gordon model which arises here after bosonization . in order to make some of our rather unintuitive results seem more plausible we discuss an exact mapping of our boundary pairing model ( in the particle - hole symmetric case ) into a hubbard model with a bulk magnetic field and a transverse boundary magnetic field . in the transformed model",
    "the andreev boundary condition corresponds to one in which the boundary electron has a frozen transverse spin polarization .    in the next section",
    "we give the solution of the interface and boundary models and discuss their equivalence , in the case of zero bulk interactions .",
    "most of the details of the equivalence are relegated to an appendix . in sec .",
    "iii we consider an @xmath45 system and calculate the josephson current . in sec .",
    "iv we include bulk interactions in the boundary model and determine phase diagrams and critical exponents . in sec .",
    "v we discuss the exact mapping onto the hubbard model with bulk and boundary magnetic fields .",
    "in this section , we consider various lattice models of normal metal - superconductor contacts in the case of zero bulk interactions .",
    "the generic hamiltonian for all of these will be ( [ ifh ] ) , with various geometries , sets of hopping strenths , and potentials specified along the way .",
    "the calculation procedure is similar to the usual one used in dealing with continuum models : the wavefunctions are found for each sector , and the matching conditions at the contacts yield consistency equations from which the various reflection / transmission coefficients are obtained .",
    "we start by performing the bogoliubov - de gennes transformation @xmath46 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the quasiparticle operators satisfy @xmath47 and @xmath48 is a ( real ) quasimomentum index .",
    "we obtain @xcite , by requiring the hamiltonian to be diagonal @xmath49 the following lattice bogoliubov - de gennes equations : @xmath50 the solutions of these equations in two particular geometries are presented below .",
    "the emphasis is put on the calculation of the andreev reflection coefficient and on the low - energy properties of the system .      as a simple toy model for a ns interface",
    ", we consider the geometry depicted in figure [ fig : interface ] .",
    "this tight - binding model is one of free electrons in which a nonvanishing superconducting order parameter has been induced by an unspecified mechanism on the left - hand sites of the lattice only .",
    "although it is a straightforward lattice version of the ubiquitous continuum one - dimensional models used in [ ] and numerous subsequent work , let us underline that our model includes some additional features , namely different bandwidths @xmath51 on the normal and superconducting sides , and an arbitrary coupling @xmath10 together with a local scattering potential @xmath13 at the interface .",
    "in other words , our lattice interface model is defined by the bdg equations ( [ latticebdg ] ) with the choice of parameters in ( [ parameters ] ) .",
    "the calculation of the normal and andreev reflection coefficients in the lattice interface model is nothing but an exercise in elementary quantum mechanics .",
    "namely , it is performed by choosing an appropriate ansatz for the wavefunctions , after which solving for the matching conditions of the eigenstates at the interface yields all the desired information .",
    "let us implement this procedure by taking a simple travelling wave solution to the bogoliubov - de gennes equations ( [ latticebdg ] ) : @xmath52 in the above equation , the quasimomenta @xmath53 and @xmath54 will turn out to be complex for the region of parameters we will be concentrating on , namely at energies below the superconducting gap .",
    "this means that the wavefunction amplitudes @xmath55 and @xmath56 are exponentially decaying on the left - hand side .",
    "the rest of the procedure is then a simple matter of substituting ( [ solutions ] ) in ( [ latticebdg ] ) and carrying out the necessary algebra .",
    "the energy is @xmath57 while the other parameters in ( [ solutions ] ) are given by @xmath58    although all reflection and transmission coefficients can be calculated explicitly , a simpler form for these expressions is obtained if we are interested primarily in the scattering of particles whose energy is very small compared to the superconducting energy gap .",
    "the @xmath59 limit gives @xmath60 and allows us to write the following expression for the andreev reflection coefficient : @xmath61}{t^2-\\mu^2/4 +   ( v -\\mu/2 -\\frac{{t''}^2}{t ' } e^{i\\beta})(v-\\mu/2 + \\frac{{t''}^2}{t ' } e^{i \\delta})}. \\label{raeoi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above , @xmath19 is the phase of the order parameter , @xmath62 .",
    "note that the reflection coefficients moreover obey the sum rule @xmath63 at half - filling , in view of the conservation of the current @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "this low - energy andreev reflection coefficient , as a function of the bandwidths @xmath51 and of the strength of the pairing @xmath30 , as well as of the tunneling strength @xmath10 and local scattering potential @xmath13 , obeys some simple but interesting properties .",
    "imagining for example a generic experimental setup in which variations in @xmath10 and @xmath13 can be implemented , we can ask how @xmath65 behaves .",
    "a simple variation yields that the optimal amplitude is achieved for @xmath66 ( here @xmath67 denotes complex conjugate . )",
    "subsequently tuning @xmath10 yields a maximum at @xmath68 in the particle - hole symmetric case , this simplifies to @xmath69.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] tuning the parameters in such a way , we find perfect andreev reflection , i.e. @xmath70 in terms of left- and right - movers in the continuum limit of ( [ solutions ] ) , defined in sec .",
    "iv , this corresponds to @xmath71 which are simply the perfect andreev conditions usually imposed .",
    "thus , pure andreev boundary conditions are obtainable in the lattice interface model by simply tuning two parameters in the general non particle - hole symmetric case . for the particle - hole symmetric case , it is enough to tune one parameter .      at energies below the superconducting gap ,",
    "all wavefunctions incident on the ns interface from the normal side are eventually reflected back through either normal or andreev reflection processes .",
    "the vanishing of the transmission coefficients opens the door to the formulation of a different approach than that adopted in the interface model , namely one in which we consider a system with a boundary obtained by `` integrating out '' the superconducting side , yielding an effective pairing potential localized at the original contact . in all generality",
    ", we will also consider a potential present at the boundary .",
    "what we could call the lattice boundary model can be directly defined through the bdg equations ( [ latticebdg ] ) , but our system ( illustrated in figure [ fig : boundary ] ) is now taken to live on the axis of positive integers , with a boundary at @xmath72 having on - site pairing @xmath27 and potential @xmath28 on the first site .",
    "the hopping strength is taken to be @xmath73 between all sites . for the moment",
    ", we will perform all the relevant calculations from scratch , deferring the explicit connection with the previous interface model until later .    in the same way as for the interface model",
    ", we can calculate the normal and andreev reflection coefficients by simple quantum mechanics .",
    "of primary interest is the andreev one , which is readily obtained by using the ansatz @xmath74 in the lattice bdg equations ( [ latticebdg ] ) in the geometry just described .",
    "we find again @xmath75 with @xmath76 , together with @xmath77 which , at zero energy , becomes @xmath78    the modulus of this coefficient is plotted in figure [ fig : modra1 ] at half - filling , as a function of the boundary pairing @xmath27 and boundary scattering potential @xmath28 .",
    "the maximal amplitude has unit modulus , and such a maximum occurs for any choice of filling in view of a similar optimization property to the one in the interface model .",
    "namely , tuning @xmath28 and @xmath27 yields a maximum amplitude at @xmath79 and this once again produces the perfect andreev condition @xmath80    figure ( [ fig : modra3 ] ) shown the influence of a progressively stronger boundary scattering potential @xmath28 on the andreev reflection coefficient at half - filling , plotted against the boundary pairing strength .",
    "the equivalence of formulas ( [ raeoi ] ) and ( [ raeob ] ) for the effective low - energy andreev reflection coefficients comes from the fact that , as mentioned before , the lattice boundary model is obtainable by integrating out the gapped side of the interface model .",
    "this procedure is outlined in appendix a , in which the explicit relationship between interface and boundary pairings and potentials is derived . at low energies , this correspondence reads @xmath81 , \\hspace{1.0 cm }   v_b = v + \\frac{{t''}^2}{2 t ' } \\left [ \\frac{\\mu}{t ' } - i\\sin \\beta   + i \\sin \\delta \\right ] .",
    "\\label{correspondence}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the particle - hole symmetric case , this means that @xmath82.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the interesting aspect of this formula comes from its behaviour in various limits .",
    "contrary to simple intuition , a large bulk pairing @xmath83 on the superconducting side induces a @xmath84 boundary pairing @xmath27 , according to the limit @xmath85 whereas a small @xmath86 yields a boundary pairing whose amplitude depends on the hopping parameters exclusively : @xmath87 it is important to note that these formulas hold for @xmath88 , so one should not be surprised that a small bulk pairing still produces a significant boundary pairing , with a finite amount of andreev reflection .",
    "the limits of zero energy and zero pairing do not commute .",
    "the above formulas allow one to move freely between interface and boundary formulations of the ns problem , as long as the low - energy sector of the theory is considered .",
    "they will be used in the next section , which is devoted to the calculation of the josephson current in a sns junction .",
    "from the considerations of the earlier sections , we see that the problem of an @xmath89 superconducting junction can be investigated within a double boundary framework , provided we are interested only in energies much smaller than the gaps on either side .",
    "if we imagine integrating out both the left and right superconductors , we obtain a lattice model with two boundary pairings , which we dub the boundary junction model .",
    "namely , we take this to be the model of free electrons in the bulk , with pairings @xmath90 and @xmath91 at the right and left ends .",
    "it is important to realize that @xmath92 are @xmath93 pairings , whose influence on the reflection coefficients has been explained in detail in the previous section .",
    "one should be careful not to confuse them with bulk pairings , which have an altogether different effect ( the two are related , of course , by the relationship ( [ correspondence ] ) ) .",
    "we thus define the system on sites @xmath94 and take @xmath95 with @xmath96 ( that is , we have put all the superconducting phase difference on the right pairing ) .    solving the lattice bdg equations by using the ansatz @xmath97 with @xmath98 yields after a certain amount of algebra the condition for the allowed quasiparticle momenta @xmath48 ( we have chosen @xmath18 to be odd ) .",
    "we find ( for convenience , we have set @xmath99 in what follows ) @xmath100 using a generalization of the approach used in [ ] to treat the problem of free electrons on a tight - binding chain with a boundary scattering potential , we can conveniently find the closed form solution .",
    "first of all , let us write the allowed momenta in terms of energy - dependent phase shifts @xmath101 as @xmath102 where @xmath103 refers to the two independent sets of andreev levels , labeled by the integer @xmath104 .",
    "substituting this into ( [ allowedalpha ] ) yields @xmath105 noting that @xmath106 throughout the parameter space allows us to write this as @xmath107 where the functions @xmath108 and @xmath109 are defined by @xmath110 studying carefully the various functions along paths in the parameter space yields a consistent choice of branches for the inverse trigonometric functions .",
    "this leads to the final answer for the phase shifts , which we write as @xmath111 where @xmath112 and all @xmath113 functions have their image in @xmath114 $ ] .",
    "the phase shifts are analytic except at the bottom and top of the band at the perfect andreev points , where @xmath108 suffers a branch jump .    knowing the phase shifts allows us to compute all the energy levels , and understand their behaviour as a function of the boundary pairings and the superconducting phase difference @xmath19 .",
    "one recovers the usual picture wherein the levels are separated by finite gaps on an energy versus phase diagram , except at the perfect andreev points , where the gaps vanish .",
    "the reason why it is so convenient to solve for the allowed quasiparticle momenta in terms of these phase shifts , is that this procedure allows us to write the ground - state energy straightforwardly in a @xmath115 expansion .",
    "again , the derivation is very similar to the one in [ ] , and we refer the reader there for the missing details .    the ground - state energy can be written as the sum of the individual energies of the occupied andreev levels .",
    "namely , @xmath116.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit of large @xmath18 , we can use a euler - maclaurin formula to transform this sum into an integral . subsequently expanding to order @xmath115",

    "is that the @xmath115 terms are functions of data exclusively at the fermi surface . while the @xmath119 term is well - known to correspond to the finite - size contribution from open boundary conditions for a conformal field theory with central charge @xmath120 like the present one ( each spinful chiral fermion carries a unit conformal charge )",
    ", the other terms depending on the squares of the phase shifts at @xmath121 give the change in @xmath122 coming from the effect of the boundary pairings .",
    "the @xmath123 term , given by fumi s theorem , depends however on @xmath54 across the whole filled part of the band .",
    "this expression for the ground - state energy allows us to write the josephson current at zero temperature in the limit of large @xmath18 , in the presence of arbitrary boundary pairings , i.e. with an arbitrary amount of normal versus andreev reflection on either edge .",
    "namely , the josephson current is given by @xmath20 upon calculating this derivative , one easily sees that fumi s theorem @xmath123 term does not contribute to @xmath124 , since the sum of the phase shifts is independent of @xmath19 for any energy ( in ( [ delta ] ) , only @xmath109 depends on @xmath19 ) .",
    "thus , the josephson current is controlled exclusively by parameters at the fermi surface , and is given by the general expression @xmath125 } { \\sqrt{4\\delta_r \\delta_l   \\sin^2 \\frac{\\chi}{2 } \\tilde{g}(\\cos^2 \\frac{\\chi}{2 } ) + \\tilde{\\delta}^2 } } \\label{current}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath126 this function reproduces the well - known behaviours in the limiting cases of perfect or very weak andreev reflection : the fine - tuning for perfect andreev reflection on both sides of the junction corresponds to setting @xmath127 , which , when substituted in ( [ current ] ) , yields @xmath128 ( ishii s sawtooth ) , while on the other hand , for small pairing , we recover the @xmath129 behaviour : @xmath130    it is instructive to plot ( [ current ] ) in various regimes .",
    "taking symmetric pairing @xmath131 to start with , we can see how ishii s sawtooth is rounded off progressively to a @xmath129 function as @xmath27 is taken from 1 ( perfect andreev ) to smaller and smaller values ( i.e. for progressively more normal reflection at the contacts ) .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : ijos1 ] .",
    "it is important to note that the expression ( [ current ] ) for the josephson current is valid for independent arbitrary values of the boundary pairings , and thus covers the case of asymmetric junctions already studied for example in [ ] . in this work ,",
    "the shape of the current - phase relationship was still the sawtooth function , with critical current depending on the asymmetry between the pairings .",
    "the sawtooth result implies that effective perfect andreev conditions were imposed , and thus that no normal reflection occurred at the contacts .",
    "our expression for the current in a long junction thus covers a wider regime than the one in [ ] .",
    "when plotting ( [ current ] ) for various asymmetries , the graphs look very similar to figure [ fig : ijos1 ] .    the formidable looking expression ( [ current ] )",

    "this occurs , for example , for the attractive hubbard model .",
    "the presence of a bulk spin gap makes very little difference to our analysis .",

    "we consider both cases below .",
    "free boundary conditions , which occur for @xmath41 , correspond to:@xcite @xmath173 where the phase @xmath174 depends on the boundary scattering potential @xmath28 .",
    "note that these boundary conditions correspond to only normal reflection , and thus zero andreev reflection , so in this context it is appropriate to refer to them as `` normal '' b.c.s . in bosonized form",

    "@xmath171 the free boundary condition is an unstable fixed point .",
    "the `` obvious '' guess is that the hamiltonian renormalizes to a boundary fixed point corresponding to the boundary condition @xmath188 note that the boundary condition on the spin boson is unchanged .",
    "this is surely a reasonable assumption since the boundary interaction does nt involve the spin boson . in fact",
    "this boundary condition is fixed by su(2 ) symmetry . on the other hand",
    ", we are assuming that the effect of the relevant boundary sine - gordon interaction is to pin the dual charge boson , @xmath189 , corresponding to a semi - classical analysis of the interaction at large @xmath27 .",
    "we note that the analogous assumption has been made in several other contexts.@xcite it is generally believed that only dirichlet and neumann fixed points occur in the boundary sine - gordon model for generic compactification radius .",

    "this is irrelevant for attractive bulk interactions , but relevant in the repulsive case .",
    "thus we conclude that the andreev b.c .",
    "represents an attractive fixed point with attractive bulk interactions , so that our assumption that a boundary pairing interaction leads to a flow to the andreev b.c . for @xmath171",
    "is consistent . on the other hand , in the case of repulsive bulk interactions we expect an rg flow from the andreev fixed point to the normal fixed point .",

    "there is a line of fixed points connecting normal and andreev fixed points along which the ratio of normal to andreev scattering varies continously .",
    "this behaviour is very analogous to the backscattering problem for a single impurity in a quantum wire.@xcite    the behaviour of the josephson current in the case of attractive bulk interactions is especially interesting . from sec .",
    "3 we see , that for the non - interacting case , the josephson current is a sawtooth function of amplitude @xmath198 when the boundary terms are fine - tuned to give perfect andreev scattering at the fermi surface . otherwise , @xmath199 is a smooth function .",
    "as shown by maslov et al.@xcite , @xmath199 is also a sawtooth function in the presence of bulk interactions if the andreev b.c .",
    "is applied to the bosonized theory , with the amplitude replaced by @xmath200 .",
    "the sawtooth form is a universal property of the andreev fixed point .",
    "this universality of the @xmath201 term in the groundstate energy is a familiar aspect of conformal field theory . in cases where",
    "the boundary parameters are not fine - tuned to the andreev boundary condition , but instead the hamiltonian renormalizes to the andreev fixed point we expect to recover the same sawtooth form of @xmath199 in the limit @xmath202 .",

    "the maximum remains at @xmath210 .",
    "we note that our result for the behaviour of the josephson current near the andreev fixed point is very different from that obtained in [ ] although both treatments use bosonization and rg arguments .",
    "the difference arises in part because we take into account the andreev b.c . in calculating the rg scaling of the normal reflection amplitude and in part because we take into account the singular dependence of the josephson current on the normal reflection amplitude .    in the case of repulsive bulk interactions and",
    "almost perfectly fine - tuned junction parameters a flow away from the andreev b.c .",
    "occurs with increasing junction length . in this case",
    "the effective parameter @xmath211 _ increases _ with increasing @xmath18 so that the sawtooth singularity is smoothed out as @xmath18 _",
    "increases_.    as mentioned above , in the case of attractive bulk interactions a spin gap sometimes occurs , for example in the @xmath42 hubbard model .",
    "this has essentially no effect on the boundary rg discussed above since the spin boson did nt play any role .",
    "essentially the spin boson is assumed to always obey the dirichelt b.c .",
    ", @xmath212 throughout the rg flow which only affects the b.c.s on the charge boson . in the case where there is a spin gap , @xmath213",
    "is pinned at all points in space ; this is completely compatible with the assumption about the b.c .",
    "we find the flow to the andreev b.c . in the attractive case",
    "especially remarkable because , as explained in the previous section , in the non - interacting case perfect andreev scattering can only be achieved by fine - tuning parameters .",
    "thus , in the interacting case , the rg flow must `` find '' the special value of the parameters at which the normal scattering vanishes .",
    "in an effort to make more plausible the conjectures about rg flows in the previous section and in order to make contact with previous work on quantum impurity problems we present in this section an exact duality transformation from the lattice boundary pairing model with bulk interactions of the previous section to a lattice model with both bulk and boundary magnetic fields .",
    "this is related to the previously studied@xcite s=1/2 xxz chain with a transverse boundary field .",
    "these latter models are perhaps easier to understand intuitively because semi - classical approximations hold to some extent .",
    "furthermore there is an instructive difference between the hubbard chain and pure spin chain corresponding to a sort of breakdown of `` spin - charge separation '' for strong boundary fields .",
    "we begin with the ( semi - infinite ) boundary pairing of eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) with the hubbard interaction of eq .",
    "( [ hint ] ) added .",
    "we then apply the well - known duality transformation which changes the sign of the hubbard coupling constant , @xmath38 , and interchanges charge and spin operators .",
    "this is essentially a particle - hole transformation _ for spin up electrons only _ : @xmath214 this maps the hopping term into itself and the hubbard interaction into @xmath215 itself .",
    "the chemical potential term is mapped into a magnetic field in the @xmath216-direction : @xmath217 thus a non - zero chemical potential , corresponding to average particle number @xmath218 maps into a non - zero bulk magnetic field in the @xmath216-direction .",
    "note however , that the dual model has zero chemical potential so it remains at half - filling .",
    "longer range density - density interactions map into @xmath216-@xmath216 magnetic exchange interactions . the boundary scattering term",
    ", @xmath28 maps into a modified boundary field in the @xmath216-direction .",
    "the boundary pairing interaction is mapped into : @xmath219 this corresponds to a boundary magnetic field lying in the xy plane , transverse to the bulk field , of magnitude @xmath220 and direction determined by the phase of @xmath27 .",
    "this dual model is especially easy to analyse in the case where @xmath42 so that there is a spin gap in the hubbard model .",
    "the dual model , with @xmath221 and half - filling has a gap for charge excitations .",
    "the remaining gapless spin excitations are approximately described by the heisenberg model with the appropriate magnetic fields . to make this correspondance more precise , when @xmath222 , the correspondance holds for the lattice models with an effective heisenberg exchange interaction @xmath223 . for smaller @xmath38",
    "the correspondance still holds for the low energy degrees of freedom . even in situations where the original spin excitations were not gapped so that the dual charge excitations are not gapped",
    ", we might expect some sort of correspondance with the heisenberg model at low energies due to spin - charge separation .",
    "the xxz s=1/2 spin model with a transverse boundary field ( but no bulk field ) was analysed in [ ] . there it was shown that the bosonized version is the boundary sine - gordon model with a boundary interaction which is relevant along the entire bulk xxz critical line and it was conjectured that an rg flow to the neumann b.c . occurs . in the particular case of the xx model",
    "this can be proven exactly using ising model duality transformations.@xcite the semi - classical interpretation of the neumann b.c . in this case",
    "is that the boundary spin is polarized in the direction of the boundary field .",
    "this analysis can be easily extended to include a bulk magnetic field in the z - direction . as shown in [ ]",
    ", the dimension of the transverse boundary field is @xmath224 where @xmath225 is the compactification radius of the boson in the spin chain .",
    "[ to fix our conventions , the transverse staggered correlation exponent is also @xmath224 . ]",
    "this becomes marginal for the isotropic xxx model but is relevant along the entire ( zero field ) xxz critical line .",
    "the dependence of the radius on a magnetic field applied to the heisenberg model has been calculated from the bethe ansatz.@xcite the effect is again to decrease the radius , hence making the transverse boundary field relevant .",
    "thus it is again natural to conjecture a flow to a fixed boundary spin polarized in the direction of the boundary field .",
    "thus , _ flow to the andreev b.c . in the boundary pairing model is dual to flow to a fixed spin b.c . in the boundary field",
    "model_.    this analysis can be extended to more general models with longer range bulk interactions .",
    "in particular , we may consider cases in which the spin excitations are not gapped in the original model so that charge excitations are not gapped in the dual model .",
    "again it seems plausible that even a weak transverse boundary field produces a flow to a polarized spin boundary fixed point .",
    "however , we now encounter another interesting phenomenon .",
    "if the boundary field is too strong it suppresses this rg flow .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that , in the limit of a very strong transverse boundary field , one electron gets trapped on the first site with probability 1 in a state with spin polarized along the transverse field direction . since the hopping term adds or removes an electron from site 1 it produces a high energy state , with energy of order the boundary field , @xmath226 .",
    "all such processes are suppressed for @xmath227 meaning that the first site decouples from all the others which therefore obey a free b.c .",
    "thus , in the finite @xmath38 model the spin - polarized neumann b.c . should not be thought of as occuring at infinite boundary field , but rather at a finite value . on the other hand , in the heisenberg model we may indeed think of the spin polarized fixed point as occurring at infinite boundary field since the magnetic exchange interaction is nt suppressed by the strong field .",
    "thus we see that the limit @xmath228 and @xmath229 do not commute .",
    "the above observation provides another way of understanding the perhaps surprising discovery in the previous sections that the andreev fixed point does not occur at @xmath230 boundary pairing strength but rather at a fine - tuned finite value . in this model at very strong @xmath27 we may think of a sort of andreev boundstate occurring on the first site corresponding to a linear combination of the vacuum and filled state : @xmath231 since the hopping term always turns this andreev boundstate into a state with a single electron at site 1 it produces a high energy state and its effects are therefore suppressed when @xmath227 . in the original sn interface model we may think of the andreev boundstate as blocking electron transport across the interface and hence suppressing andreev scattering .",
    "this research was supported by nserc of canada and the nsf under grant no .",
    "phy94 - 07194 .",
    "in this appendix , we outline the steps leading to the correspondence between the parameters in the interface and boundary models .",
    "let us thus consider the interface model , which has nonzero gap on sites @xmath232 .",
    "our strategy will consist in integrating these out . for simplicity ,",
    "let us use the notation @xmath233 for the fields on site one . omitting all sites with @xmath234 for ease of notation ,",
