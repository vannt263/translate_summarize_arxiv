    "the famous supernova sn1987a in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) brought the field of supernova neutrino astrophysics to life .",
    "two water cherenkov detectors , kamiokande ii and imb , detected 20 events between them  @xcite ; two scintillator detectors , baksan and lsd  @xcite also reported observations .",
    "the sparse sn1987a neutrino data were sufficient to confirm the baseline model of gravitational collapse causing type ii sne and to put limits on neutrino properties ( such as a @xmath0 mass limit of around 20  ev . ) to make distinctions between different theoretical models of core collapse and supernova explosions and to extract more information about neutrino properties , we await the more copious neutrino signal which the new generation of large neutrino experiments will detect from the next such event in our galaxy .    when the core of a massive star at the end of its life collapses , less than 1% of the gravitational binding energy of the neutron star will be released in the forms of optically visible radiation and the kinetic energy of the expanding remnant .",
    "the remainder of the binding energy is radiated in neutrinos , of which @xmath11% will be electron neutrinos from an initial `` neutronization '' burst and the remaining 99% will be neutrinos from the later cooling reactions , roughly equally distributed among flavors .",
    "average neutrino energies are expected to be about 13 - 14  mev for @xmath2 , 14 - 16  mev for @xmath0 , and 20 - 21  mev for all other flavors .",
    "the neutrinos are emitted over a total timescale of tens of seconds , with about half emitted during the first 1 - 2  seconds .",
    "reference  @xcite summarizes the expected features of a core collapse neutrino signal ; more recent simulation work can be found in _",
    "e.g_.  @xcite .",
    "a core - collapse supernova in our galaxy will bring a wealth of scientific information .",
    "the neutrino signal will provide information about the properties of neutrinos themselves and astrophysicists will learn about the nature of the core collapse .",
    "one unique feature of the neutrino signal is that it is _ prompt _  neutrinos emerge on a timescale of tens of seconds , while the first electromagnetic signal may be hours or days after the stellar collapse .",
    "therefore , neutrino observation can provide an _ early alert _ that could allow astronomers a chance to make unprecedented observations of the very early turn - on of the supernova light curve ; even observations of sne as young as a few days are rare for extra - galactic supernovae .",
    "the environment immediately surrounding the progenitor star is probed by the initial stages of the supernova .",
    "for example , any effects of a close binary companion upon the blast would occur very soon after shock breakout .",
    "uv and soft x - ray flashes are predicted at very early times .",
    "finally , there may be entirely unexpected effects  no supernova has ever been observed very soon after its birth . although the neutrino signal will be plentiful in practically all galactic core collapses , it is possible that there will be little or no optical fireworks ( the supernova `` fizzles '' ) ; the nature of any observable remnant would then be very interesting .",
    "this paper focuses on the prompt alert which is possible using the neutrino signal .",
    "we will describe the technical aspects of the system .",
    "section  [ overview ] gives an overview of snews , and section  [ signal ] briefly covers the expected signal in current detectors .",
    "section  [ 3ps ] discusses some issues associated with snews .",
    "section  [ indiv ] introduces the individual experiments monitors .",
    "section  [ implementation ] covers snews implementation and defines the coincidence conditions and alert scheme .",
    "section  [ highrate ] describes the results of the `` high - rate '' system test performed in 2001 .",
    "section  [ alert ] describes the alert to the astronomical community .",
    "section  [ future ] gives future directions .",
    "the final section summarizes .",
    "the snews ( supernova early warning system ) collaboration is an international group of experimenters from several supernova neutrino - sensitive experiments .",
    "the primary goal of snews is to provide the astronomical community with a prompt alert for a galactic supernova .",
    "an additional goal is to optimize global sensitivity to supernova neutrino physics , by such cooperative work as downtime coordination .    the idea of a blind central coincidence computer receiving signals from several experiments has been around for some time ( _ e.g. _  @xcite . )",
    "in addition to the basic early warning advantages of a neutrino detector , there are several benefits from a system involving neutrino signals from two or more different detectors .",
    "first , if the supernova is distant and only weak signals are recorded , a coincidence between signals from different detectors effectively increases the sensitivity by allowing reductions in alarm thresholds and allowing one to impose a minimum of ( possibly model - dependent ) expectations on the form of the signal .",
    "second , even if a highly sensitive detector such as super - k is online , _",
    "_ requiring a coincidence among several detectors effectively reduces the `` non - poissonian '' background present for any given detector and enormously increases the confidence in an alert . _",
    "_ background alarms at widely separated laboratories are highly unlikely to be correlated . without the additional confidence from coincident neutrino observations",
    ", it would be very difficult for any individual detector to provide an _ automated _ alert to astronomers .",
    "finally , using signals from more than one detector , there is some possibility for determining the direction of the source when a single detector alone can provide no information ( see reference  @xcite . )",
    "unfortunately triangulation is in practice quite difficult to do promptly , and can not point as well as individual detectors .",
    "an important question for snews is : how often is a galactic supernova likely to occur ?",
    "estimates vary widely , but are typically in the range of about one per 30 years ( _ e.g. _ @xcite . )",
    "this is frequent enough to have a reasonable hope of observing one during the next five or ten years , but rare enough to mean that we must take special care not to miss anything when one occurs .",
    "the charter member experiments of snews are super - kamiokande ( super - k ) in japan , the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) in canada and the large volume detector ( lvd ) in italy .",
    "representatives from amanda , icecube , kamland , borexino , mini - boone , icarus , omnis , and ligo participate in the snews working group , and we hope will eventually join the active coincidence .    there is currently a single coincidence server , hosted by brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "we expect that additional machines will be deployed in the future .",
    "the bnl computer continuously runs a coincidence server process , which waits for alarm datagrams from the experiments clients , and provides an alert if there is a coincidence within a specified time window ( 10 seconds for normal running . )",
    "we have implemented a scheme of `` gold '' and `` silver '' alerts : gold alerts are intended for automated dissemination to the community ; silver alerts will be disseminated among the experimenters , and require human checking .    as of this writing , no inter - experiment coincidence , real or accidental , has ever occurred ( except in high rate test mode ) , nor has any core collapse event been detected within the lifetimes of the currently active experiments .",
    "there are several classes of detectors capable of observing neutrinos from gravitational collapse .",
    "most supernova neutrino detectors are designed primarily for other purposes , _ e.g. _ for proton decay searches , solar and atmospheric neutrino physics , accelerator neutrino oscillation studies , and high energy neutrino source searches .",
    ".supernova neutrino detector types and their primary capabilities.[tab : detector_types ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     although these somewhat non - stationary data , taken at lowered threshold , do not necessarily imply that rates will also be non - stationary when thresholds are raised and running conditions are normal , one can never be completely sure that individual experiment rates will not increase unexpectedly .",
    "this is the motivation for the rate - dependent gold suppression scheme of section  [ suppression ] .",
    "the coincidence server now has capability for continuous high rate testing , using tagged test alarms in parallel with normal alarms .",
    "at the supernova early alert workshop of 1998 , the conclusion from the astronomer working group  @xcite was that `` the message will spread itself '' and that snews will need to do no more than send out emails to as many astronomers as possible .",
    "snews maintains a mailing list of interested parties , including both professionals and amateurs , to be alerted in the case of a coincidence .    in an ideal case",
    ", the coincidence network provides the astronomical community with an event time and an error box on the sky at which interested observers could point their instruments . in a realistic case ,",
    "the size of the error box is dependent on the location of the supernova and the experiments which are online , and may be very large ( and at this time will not be available in the initial alert message . )",
    "however , members of the mailing list with wide - angle viewing capability ( satellites , small telescopes ) should be able to pinpoint an optical event quickly .",
    "although an unknown fraction of galactic supernovae will be obscured by dust , many will be visible to amateurs with modest equipment .",
    "regardless of the quality of neutrino pointing available , however , the advance warning alone gives observers of all kinds valuable time to get to their observatories and prepare to gather data as soon as an accurate position is determined .",
    "a target of opportunity proposal for the hubble space telescope , `` observing the next nearby supernova '' , aiming to take advantage of early supernova light based on an early warning , was approved  @xcite for cycle 13 and was operational for cycles 8 through 12 .",
    "the large pool of skilled and well - equipped amateur astronomers is also prepared to help locate a nearby supernova .",
    "the editors of _ sky & telescope _ magazine have set up a clearinghouse for amateur observers in search for first light ( and a precise optical position as early as possible )  @xcite , via their astroalert service  @xcite .",
    "this was started by former editor - in - chief leif robinson , and has the continued support of current editor - in - chief rick fienberg . in collaboration with the american association of variable star observers ,",
    "they have developed a set of criteria for evaluating amateur responses to an alert , so that a reliable precise position can be disseminated as early as possible .",
    "for instance : there must be at least two consistent reports , demonstrated lack of motion , lack of identification with known asteroid and variable star databases , variability consistent with supernova light curves and , if the information is available , a spectrum consistent with known supernova types .    on february 14 2003 , _ sky & telescope _",
    "performed a test for amateurs . a transient target ( the asteroid vesta at a near - stationary point in its retrograde loop )",
    "was selected , which at the time was about magnitude 6.7 .",
    "_ sky & telescope _ issued an alert ( very carefully tagged as a test ) to their mailing list , with a given 13-degree uncertainty radius .",
    "they received 83 responses via the web response form , and more by email .",
    "the responses were of world - wide distribution , and although many observers experienced poor conditions , six were successful in identifying the target . from this experience , they have suggested refinements to optimize amateur astronomer strategy .",
    "a second test is planned soon , and should be a regular occurrence .",
    "we maintain two alert mailing lists which will be sent to automatically by the snews coincidence software in the case of an alert .",
    "the first is the gold alert list , which includes all astronomers who have signed up , including _ sky & telescope _ and the hst astronomers , and is to be an _ automated _ alert . the second mailing list will be for silver alerts , and is to be sent to neutrino experimenters only .",
    "these alerts will be checked out by shiftworkers at their respective experiments before an alert is issued ; each experiment is responsible for making sure the silver alert messages reach shiftworkers .",
    "each experimental collaboration defines its own protocol for acting on a snews silver or gold alert .    for both silver and gold cases , a message containing the following information :    * utc time of the coincidence , * all detectors involved in the coincidence , and * the types of alarms ( good , possible ) for each experiment involved in the coincidence    will be automatically sent by the server to the snews subgroup members .",
    "the information may also be posted to a restricted snews subgroup page for silver , and a public page for gold .    to allow the confirmation of a snews alert as really coming from snews",
    ", any alerts will be public key signed using the snews key .",
    "this key has the i d #  68df93f7 , and is available on the network of public pgp keyservers such as ` http://pgp.mit.edu/ `    note that there is no restriction on individual experiments making any announcement based on individual observation in the case of absence of a snews alert , silver or gold , or preceding or following any snews alert message . any individual experiment may publicly announce a supposed supernova signal following a dispatched silver alert which has not yet been upgraded to gold . in this case the information that a previous silver alert from the snews server(s ) has been received should be cited .",
    "at the time of this writing , silver alerts only between super - k and lvd are activated .",
    "we are working towards having the operational mode described in this paper to be activated in the very short term , comprising automated good alarms from super - k and lvd , but automated possible alarms only from sno , such that sno will participate in a gold alert only if at least two other experiments good alarms are present .",
    "we also expect snews to incorporate more galactic - supernova - sensitive neutrino detectors over the next few years .",
    "in addition , we may expand the network of servers with additional secure sites .",
    "in summary , several supernova neutrino detectors are now online . if a stellar core collapse occurs in our galaxy , these detectors will record signals from which a wealth of physical and astrophysical information can be mined .",
    "an early alert of a gravitational collapse occurrence is essential to give astronomers the best chance possible of observing the physically interesting and previously poorly observed early turn - on of the supernova light curve .",
    "a coincidence of several neutrino experiments is a very powerful technique for reducing `` non - poissonian '' false alarms to the astronomical community , in order to allow a prompt alarm .",
    "we have implemented such a system , currently incorporating several running detectors : lvd , sno and super - k .",
    "we expect to expand the network in the near future , and move to a more automated mode in the near future ."
