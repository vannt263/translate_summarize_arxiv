    "<S> we study finite - frequency quantum noise and photon - assisted electron transport through a wide and ballistic graphene sheet sandwiched between two metallic leads . </S>",
    "<S> the elementary excitations allow as to examine the differences between effects related to fabry - prot like interferences and signatures caused by correlations of coherently scattered particles in electron- and hole - like parts of the dirac spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we identify different features in the current - current auto- and cross - correlation spectra and trace them back to the interference patterns of the product of transmission- and reflection amplitudes which define the integrands of the involved correlators . at positive frequencies </S>",
    "<S> the correlator of the auto - terminal noise spectrum with final- and initial state associated to the measurement terminal is dominant . </S>",
    "<S> phase jumps occur within the interference patterns of corresponding integrands , which also reveal the intrinsic energy scale of the two - terminal graphene setup . </S>",
    "<S> the excess noise spectra , as well as the cross - correlation ones , show large fluctuations between positive and negative values . </S>",
    "<S> oscillatory signatures of the cross - correlation noise are due to an alternating behavior of the integrands . </S>"
