    "however , the quark picture and qcd have suggested one more interesting possibility , to violate isospin by strong interactions as well .",
    "this is possible due to mass difference between @xmath10 and @xmath11 quarks .",
    "parametricaly , such mechanism could be stronger than e.m .",

    "therefore , very elaborate work , both theoretical and experimental , will be necessary to pick out the underlying physics and separate various sources of isospin violation .",
    "a special situation appears in the decay @xmath13 ( branching ratio about 2% @xcite ) , where enhancement becomes possible ( and seems to be operative ) due to transition of @xmath1 into @xmath14 having the near mass and large width @xmath15 .",
    "however , experiments with this mode can extract only one real parameter ( instead of two or more , see below for details ) and , thus , are insufficient to reveal the isospin violation mechanism(s ) .    in this respect ,",
    "one more decay mode has attracted much attention in recent years .",
    "it is the radiative decay @xmath8 .",
    "its partial width was expected to be the same as for the charged companion @xmath16 . meanwhile , experiment seems to give evidence @xcite for a higher branching ratio of the neutral mode as compared to the charged one , though the result might still change . , and @xmath17-annihilation for @xmath14 .",
    "backgrounds are also very different and not quite clear for @xmath14 , see short discussion below . ]",
    "qualitatively , it may have reasonable explanation as being due to mixture of the direct decay and the cascade transition through @xmath1 with the relatively large amplitude @xmath18 .",
    "quantitative consideration has been mainly done in terms of a kind of effective field theory with some model lagrangian ( like vector dominance model , chiral perturbation theory and so on , see ref.@xcite and many references therein ) .",
    "such approaches , to be applicable , need some limitations ( _ e.g. _ , constant and real transition vertices ) , which may appear too restrictive .",
    "another approach , in terms of propagators , was applied more recently  @xcite .",
    "motivated by summing general feynman graphs , it gave unexpectedly large enhancement for @xmath8 .",
    "in the present paper this approach is reconsidered more accurately .",
    "the consideration is then extended further to show that the @xmath7-mixing should affect a wider set of decay modes where effects of mixing should be possible as well providing enhancements or suppressions of partial widths .",
    "indeed , the present data qualitatively confirm the expected role of mixing . such a way , at better experimental accuracy , may help to construct a consistent picture of the isospin violation and to clarify its nature .",

    "the above picture of @xmath7-mixing is quite similar to the well - known mixing of @xmath77 as described by lee , oehme , yang @xcite .",
    "the bare states @xmath78 and @xmath79 appear to be analogs of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , while the physical states @xmath82 play the role of @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( compare with expressions ( 15 ) ; @xmath85 and @xmath86 are normalizing factors ) . the essential difference",
    ", however , is @xmath87 , which would imply @xmath88-violation in the case of @xmath77 .",
    "this similarity reveals one more property of the @xmath7-system . in the case of exact isospin conservation",
    "the bare states @xmath89 and @xmath90 can not be coherent , and their phases ( absolute and/or relative ) are totally independent . if mixing is possible , the physical states @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be coherent to each other , so their relative phase becomes physically meaningful .",
    "nevertheless , phases of the bare states stay arbitrary and may be changed so to not change phases of the physical states ( of course , phases of the normalizing factors and of @xmath91 should be changed correspondingly ) .",
    "such procedure , rephasing , is familiar in description of neutral kaons , with only rephasing - invariant quantities being physically meaningful and measurable .",

    "we know that the states @xmath83 and @xmath84 would be mutually orthogonal only if @xmath29 ( or @xmath92 ) were conserved .",
    "the bare states @xmath93 and @xmath94 in the @xmath7-system are , surely , orthogonal to each other , but the physical states @xmath95 and @xmath96 can be also orthogonal only if @xmath97 evidently , this condition implies @xmath98 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath99 ) , which would be provided by @xmath29-invariance . hence , the @xmath29-invariance is necessary for @xmath42-orthogonality , in similarity with neutral kaons .",
    "it is not , however , sufficient .",
    "eq.(19 ) is consistent with definition ( 10 ) only if @xmath74 ( and @xmath100 ) is real .",
    "note that combinations @xmath100 ( and @xmath74 as well ) and @xmath101 are rephasing - invariant , _",
    "i.e. _ , not changed if phases of @xmath93 and @xmath94 change under fixed phases of @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "thus , the necessary and sufficient condition of the @xmath42-orthogonality is possibility to choose such phases of the bare states that @xmath102 and @xmath103 are equal and real .",
    "this condition may appear not natural ( see discussion below and recall that the @xmath104 s contain the complex denominator @xmath105 ) , so , most probably , the mixed physical eigenstates are non - orthogonal even in spite of the @xmath29-conservation .",
    "there is one more similarity between @xmath7 and @xmath77 systems .",
    "@xmath92-violation for neutral kaons can manifest itself in two forms : the mixing violation due to a @xmath92-violating structure of the kaon effective hamiltonian , and the direct violation related directly to kaon decay amplitudes .",
    "isospin violation in the @xmath7-system may , analogously , have two forms : the mixing violation due to isospin - violating structure of the mass squared matrix ( 16 ) ( nonvanishing @xmath106 and/or @xmath107 ) , and the direct violation ( nonvanishing , even if being isospin - forbidden , amplitudes @xmath108 for the bare meson production and/or decay amplitudes ) .",
    "if we could produce pure states @xmath89 , @xmath90 and observe their decays in real time , we would see oscillating time distributions ( analogues of oscillating decays of pure @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) .",
    "but this is surely unrealistic because of too short lifetimes , and experiments can study only two - pole structure of time - integrated @xmath40-dependencies .",
    "it should be emphasized that in any experiment one can extract only those poles related to physical @xmath0-,@xmath111-states , with residues containing physical amplitudes ( 14),(15 ) .",
    "the bare states @xmath112 and their amplitudes are unobservable .    the latter discussions in terms of states has implicitly assumed that bare amplitudes , bare masses and vertices @xmath113 are constants",
    ". however , such assumptions are not necessary .",
    "all expressions ( 7)-(17 ) conserve their form if ( all or some of ) the above quantities depend on @xmath114 .",
    "then the mixing parameters @xmath115 as well as the `` physical amplitudes '' and `` physical masses '' ( of course not pole ones ) become also @xmath40-dependent .",
    "the most popular in the literature on @xmath116 isospin violation is the meson mixing described by parameters @xmath104 since they reveal some enhancement due to the small value of @xmath105 in denominator , see definition ( 10 ) . with the reasonable assumption of @xmath29-invariance",
    "we can choose phases of the bare states so to have one ( generally , complex ) dimensionless parameter @xmath117 , which is universal in all particular processes .",
    "in an effective field theory the related parameters @xmath118 appear in the lagrangian as coupling constants for direct transitions @xmath119 . due to hermiticity , they may be taken equal and real ( the corresponding terms by themselves are inevitably @xmath29-invariant ) . even in this case the complexity of @xmath117 can not be removed ; it is totally determined by complexity of @xmath105 , due to widths of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "note that for the current experimental values of masses and widths  @xcite @xmath120 _ i.e. _ , @xmath105 is mainly imaginary , due to the large @xmath121 .",
    "realistic situation may be different .",
    "transitions @xmath122 may go through some intermediate states , virtual or real",
    ". if only virtual states are possible ( say , for the transition @xmath123 advocated in @xcite ) , then @xmath124 are pure real indeed . however ,",
    "if real intermediate states ( say , pions or pions with one photon ) are also essential , then @xmath124 should be complex by themselves .",
    "correspondingly , parameters @xmath117 , being also universal , should have additional complexity , not related to @xmath105 .",
    "such a case is surely out of framework of an effective field theory .",
    "apart from mixing , the isospin violation can manifest itself directly in amplitudes of production and/or decay of bare states @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( see eqs.@xmath127 ) .",
    "intuitively , such contributions have no enhancement and should be smaller than the enhanced mixing violation of isospin .",
    "however , this may appear not universally true",
    ". in particular , effective mechanisms for direct and mixing violations may appear different .",
    "this could make the direct isospin violation be essential in some processes , though negligible in others ( again , phenomenologically similar to apparent properties of @xmath92-violation ) .    in any case , at the present state of knowledge and experience one needs to use some model assumptions on the amplitudes and mixing .",
    "that is why separate considerations are applied in the present paper to particular @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 decays .",
    "the final state @xmath129 in these decays has isospin @xmath130 .",
    "hence , the standard ( and reasonable ) assumption is that the direct amplitude for @xmath131 vanishes ( or is very small ) , and the decay goes only , or at least mainly , through mixing - transition , see , _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite . ]",
    ". then eq.(15 ) with @xmath132 leads to @xmath133 the present experimental data  @xcite lead to @xmath134 and provide @xmath135 in good agreement with qualitative expectations ( see the brief discussion after eq.@xmath136 ) .",
    "evidently , the phase of @xmath103 can not be determined by using only this pair of decays .",
    "together with data @xcite on masses and total widths for @xmath0- and @xmath1-mesons we obtain @xmath137 in agreement with phenomenological estimates of other authors and even with some theoretical estimates .",
    "the small values ( 21 ) for @xmath138 and ( 22 ) for @xmath139 can not , by themselves , discriminate between different mechanisms of isospin violation ( say , electromagnetic , or related to a definite hadronic channel , or any other ) . phases of those parameters , being extracted from experimental data , would be very helpful .",
    "one more note is reasonable here .",
    "the error for @xmath138 in eq.(21 ) looks rather small ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "however , the true uncertainty seems to be higher .",
    "_ e.g. _ , parameters given in the previous particle data table  @xcite lead to @xmath141 with deviation about @xmath142 from the value ( 21 ) .",
    "that is why we will use @xmath142 level as the uncertainty of @xmath138 in various numerical estimates below .",
    "isospin conservation does not forbid the direct transitions , both @xmath144 and @xmath145 , since @xmath146-quantum has two isospin components .",
    "therefore , we need some information on relation between the two amplitudes .",
    "the corresponding exact predictions are still absent , and some models should be used . here",
    "we will apply relations @xmath147 that were predicted years ago @xcite on the basis of the quark model ( in the form known at present as the additive quark model ) .",
    "they were derived with two main assumptions : 1 )  mesons consist of one quark - antiquark pair ; 2 )  quark charges have their conventional values . in particular , the coefficient 3 is really a combination of charges : @xmath148 note also that eq.(23 ) needs a special choice of the relative phase between @xmath90 and @xmath89 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the phase was fixed by standard assumptions that @xmath149 .",
    "more refined approaches , like qcd sum rules , lead to nearly the same relations , but with much more complicated derivations , which become sometimes a kind of art .",
    "the limit @xmath150 , suggested in ref.@xcite as a basis for relation ( 23 ) , is not adequate .",
    "it does provide mesons containing only one quark - antiquark pair , but quark charges should be to prevent the triangle anomaly in the standard model . hence , this limit would give different coefficients for eq.(23 ) .",
    "( more detailed discussion of difficulties of the standard model at @xmath150 see in ref.@xcite . )",
    "the @xmath7-mixing does not affect the decay @xmath16 , and we can compare it with other decays to check predictions of the mixing picture .",
    "if relations ( 23 ) are correct , the physical amplitude for @xmath18 is practically the same as @xmath151 , and the ratio of widths for @xmath18 and @xmath16 @xmath152 is nearly independent of the mixing .",
    "present experimental data @xcite give @xmath153 @xmath154 this value reasonably agrees with the `` bare '' expectation of 9 .",
    "if the deviation from 9 is , nevertheless , definitely confirmed , it could be a result of @xmath155-mixing . however , such possibility looks doubtful , since the mixing correction in eq.(24 ) with the value ( 21 ) can not exceed 3% .",
    "furthermore , the mixing interpretation of the value ( 25 ) requires re@xmath156 , while other decay data , more sensitive to mixing , prefer re@xmath157 ( see below ) .",
    "therefore , more reasonable would be to admit deviation of the coefficient in eq.(23 ) from 3 .",
    "taking literally , the value ( 25 ) without mixing leads to 3.3 instead of 3 .",
    "note that increase of this coefficient would diminish the coefficient before @xmath103 in eq.(24 ) , 1/6.6 instead of 1/6 , and , hence , would diminish the mixing influence on the decay @xmath158 .",
    "neutral decay mode @xmath8 should be stronger affected by mixing . combining eqs.(15),(23 ) , we obtain its relative width in respect to @xmath9 in the form @xmath159 now we can apply @xmath29-invariance and use the value ( 21 ) . nevertheless , because of unknown phase of the mixing parameter one can determine only boundaries for @xmath160 , but not its value . with possible @xmath142 deviation for @xmath161 we obtain @xmath162 then the current value br@xmath163 @xcite gives @xmath164 now , if we knew the reliable experimental value of @xmath160 , we would be able to separate re@xmath165 and @xmath166 in addition to the value ( 21 ) for @xmath161 .",
    "note that higher / lower values of @xmath160 correspond to negative / positive values of re@xmath167 .",
    "thus , enhancement / suppression of @xmath8 in respect to @xmath9 implies negative / positive sign of re@xmath167 .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that such correlation is totally independent of the exact value of the coefficient in eq.(23 ) .",
    "therefore , even not too accurate experimental comparison of neutral and charged modes of @xmath168 directly and reliably measures the sign of re@xmath167 .",
    "if one neglects the mixing influence on br@xmath169 and uses the empirical value ( 25 ) to correct the coefficient in eq.(23 ) , then the coefficient before @xmath102 in eq.(26 ) increases , 3.3/2 instead of 3/2 , thus increasing the mixing influence on @xmath170 .",
    "numerically , however , boundaries of intervals ( 27),(28 ) stay nearly the same .",
    "we can also construct one more ratio @xmath171 with boundaries @xmath172 note that lower / upper boundary in eq.(30 ) corresponds to upper / lower boundaries for intervals ( 27),(28 ) and to negative / positive sign of re@xmath165 .    theoretical estimations for @xmath170 , as a rule , agree with the phenomenological intervals ( 27),(28 ) , with tendency to their upper ends ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the only exclusion is the essentially higher estimate  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to trace the source of such deviation .",
    "detailed comparison shows that instead of @xmath173 the amplitude of ref.@xcite contains the quantity @xmath174 with the same value of @xmath106 ( up to uncertainties and notations ) . at the current values of masses and widths  @xcite this",
    "provides the additional enhancing factor @xmath175 which transforms the intervals ( 27),(28 ) into @xmath176 the upper ends here just agree with the estimates of ref.@xcite .",
    "however , derivation in the previous section demonstrates that the mixing parameter for production and decay amplitudes ( see expressions @xmath127 ) should contain in its denominator the difference of pole masses , even though @xmath40 in propagators takes only real values and does not reach any of the pole ( complex ) masses .",
    "let us discuss the experimental situation . the latest version of particle data tables  @xcite gives the value @xmath177 based on one experiment  @xcite only .",
    "reanalysis of all existing data on @xmath178 was presented in  @xcite with taking into account coherent contributions of various resonances .",

    "the previous version of particle data tables  @xcite used the lower solution for a particular model , though ref.@xcite gave only meager motivations for this model and this solution .",
    "there are arguments showing that the results  @xcite for @xmath8 are still rather uncertain : the models used assume non - pdg values of @xmath185 and/or @xmath186 ; the triangle anomaly contribution is assumed to be the only non - resonant background , but the out - of - resonance data can not confirm its presence in @xmath178 ( though do confirm the similar anomaly contribution to @xmath187 ) ; phase relations between various resonance contributions look strange and unexpected . the own conclusion of the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite is that more measurements , with better accuracy , are necessary for the @xmath188 final state to obtain a firm result .",
    "meanwhile , the above value used in the latest tables  @xcite looks acceptable at the moment , just due to its large error .",
    "though with such or even larger uncertainties , all published measurements give evidence for the enhancement of @xmath8 in respect to @xmath9 and , thus , evidence for the negative sign of re@xmath165 .",

    "however , the large error of the value ( 36 ) makes this result rather uncertain .",
    "bare amplitudes of these decays are related just as in decays with @xmath202-meson : @xmath203 therefore , similar to @xmath204 , we can construct the ratio @xmath205 with the same boundaries @xmath206 its correlations with other similar ratios are also the same as for @xmath204 .",

    ".    decays to @xmath17 seem to admit even more detailed test of the mixing picture . for heavy quarkonia , where hypothesis of one quark - antiquark pair looks fulfilled , there is an empirical observation that the partial widths of their decays to @xmath17 equals just a constant multiplied by the corresponding quark charge squared : @xmath227 indeed , let us consider three heavier quarkonia , @xmath228 corresponding ( with good accuracy ) to the definite flavour of the constituent quark ( and antiquark ) and , hence , to the definite value of @xmath229 : @xmath230 .",
    "then , from experimental data  @xcite , @xmath231 we can try to check this regularity for @xmath232 as well , using effective charges @xmath233 . then the data  @xcite lead to values @xmath234 which look somewhat lower ( for @xmath1 ) or higher ( for @xmath0 ) than the `` normal '' values ( 47 )",
    ".    there are at least three possible explanations : 1 ) insufficient precision prevents from any statement of differences between numerical values ( 47 ) and ( 48 ) ;",
    "2 ) the present level of understanding qcd is not sufficient for extrapolating the properties of heavy quarkonia to lighter ones ; 3 ) values ( 48 ) for physical mesons @xmath235 may deviate from ( 47 ) due to mixing of bare states @xmath236 .",
    "the first two points imply that any serious discussion should be postponed till further experimental and/or theoretical progress .",
    "therefore , we will not touch them here and now ; instead we restrict ourselves to the third possibility .",
    "let us assume that the above regularity would be correct for the bare states @xmath112 and that @xmath237 is indeed a universal quantity ( without discussing why ) .",
    "then the @xmath7-mixing changes widths for the physical states @xmath238 so that @xmath239 in such a framework the relation of numerical values ( 48 ) , for @xmath14 higher than for @xmath1 , gives a new strong support to re@xmath240 and , hence , to enhancement of the mode @xmath8 in respect to @xmath241 .",
    "further , taking for definiteness the heavier quarkonium value @xmath242 from eq.(47 ) , we obtain expected intervals @xmath243 and @xmath244 quantitatively , the value ( 48 ) for @xmath1 is in good agreement with the interval ( 50 ) , while the value for @xmath14 noticeably exceeds the expected upper boundary ( 51 ) .",
    "this could mean either that @xmath245 deviates from @xmath246 or even that @xmath247 due , _",
    "e.g. _ , to direct isospin violation for decay amplitudes of the bare states ( see discussion below ) .",
    "having in mind the universal character of the mixing parameter @xmath117 , one may hope that precise investigation of a wider set of processes will allow to clarify the situation .",
    "one may add here one more notice .",
    "of course , all three values ( 47 ) coincide at the level not worse than @xmath248",
    ". nevertheless , @xmath249 and @xmath250 are equal to each other with much better accuracy , while @xmath251 is somewhat lower . such situation , if confirmed , could be due to mixing of @xmath41 with @xmath1 and/or other mesons .",
    "as was demonstrated in the preceding section , the @xmath7-mixing manifests itself not only in the well - known decay @xmath13 and in radiative decay @xmath8 , but also in some other electromagnetic decays with participation of @xmath0 or @xmath1 , in either initial or final state .",
    "particular modes of interest are radiative decays @xmath252 and decays @xmath253 going through one virtual photon .",
    "the central point of studies appears to be a special consistent correlation between properties of decays in various pairs .",
    "existing data for the decay pairs may be presented on the complex plane of the mixing parameter @xmath104 , as seen at fig.1 .",
    "if the role of mixing for the decays is correctly described in the preceding section , then all the corresponding bands should overlap .",
    "the presently achieved accuracy is not yet sufficiently informative .",
    "however , the data do not contradict to overlapping at re@xmath254 , which corresponds to enhancement of @xmath8 in respect to @xmath241 .",
    "being done with better precision , experiments on those ( and other ) decays could check the expected correlation of properties of different processes and , thus , confirm ( or reject ) the role of mixing .",
    "let us analyze the nature of that correlation .",
    "the first step in its description begins with relations for bare ( unmixed ) amplitudes . at first sight",
    ", the used relations ( 23),(31),(37),(42 ) may be justified only in the framework of a specific ( constituent quark ) model .",
    "however , they have a more general origin . indeed , electromagnetic interactions of hadrons in the quark picture are manifestations of the `` microscopic '' interaction proportional ( for light quarks ) to @xmath255 ( of course , we mean the vector current structure , well - known and not shown here explicitly in detail ) .",
    "hence , the canonical quark charges imply that isovector component of the photon is coupled to light quarks 3 times stronger than isoscalar one .",
    "all the considered pairs of decays , differing by interchange @xmath256 , have a common property : one of them contains only isovector component of the photon ( real or virtual ) , while only isoscalar component of the photon participates in another decay .",
    "relations ( 23),(31),(37),(42 ) correspond to the simple expectation from the above discussion that amplitudes for light - quark processes with the isovector photon are 3 times larger than that for similar processes with isoscalar photon .",
    "of course , these simple relations may be modified in particular processes by specific hadronic matrix elements .",
    "nevertheless , one may argue that the modifications should not be large .    indeed , the processes discussed here are soft , and essential contributions to their amplitudes come from the photon coupling to valence quarks . now ,",
    "since the valence quark structure inside any hadron is similar to the constituent quark one , it is natural to expect that relations for bare amplitudes are closely similar to the used relations ( 23),(31),(37),(42 ) .",
    "such arguments seem to be applicable both for radiative decays and for @xmath17-decays of mesons .",
    "note that similar reasoning might also explain why qcd calculations ( say , the sum rules ) and constituent quarks provide nearly the same predictions for meson radiative decays .",
    "the above relations between processes with isovector _ vs. _",
    "isoscalar photon might be applicable to amplitudes for `` bare '' ( unmixed ) states , where isospin could be a good quantum number .",
    "then the next step should be description of isospin violation by the @xmath7-mixing .",
    "it makes the relations for physical ( mixed ) amplitudes of the decays to be somewhat modified in comparison with ones for bare amplitudes .",
    "essential point is that different decay pairs are modified in a correlated way , since in all cases the mixing is described by the same universal dimensionless ( generally , complex ) phenomenological parameter    future accurate experiments should allow to check whether all those correlations are correct and , thus , examine consistency of the picture .",
    "but some piece of information does exist even now .",
    "data on @xmath13 allow to find the absolute value of the mixing parameter @xmath161 .",
    "if the decays @xmath257 were measured at least with the same precision as @xmath9 , we could extract also re@xmath165 and then test hypotheses on the mechanism of the @xmath7-mixing .",
    "meanwhile , existing direct measurements give evidence for enhancement of @xmath8 in comparison with @xmath9 ( exact number is still to be determined ) .",
    "this implies that re@xmath209 and suggests a special kind for modification of amplitudes in other pairs of decays with participation of @xmath258 .",
    "as was demonstrated in the preceding section and in fig.1 , current data on @xmath259 and @xmath260 are not confirmative yet , but nevertheless give additional support for negative re@xmath165 and , therefore , indirectly confirm enhancement of @xmath170 .",
    "since @xmath261 with nearly imaginary @xmath262 , this implies also that the direct @xmath7-vertex @xmath106 is not real and , as a result , may reject even now some simplified models for the @xmath7-transition .",
    "general character of the used relation between isovector and isoscalar components of the photon may be checked by testing it in a wider set of decays after they become accessible .",
    "as an example we can take the pair of decays @xmath263 , where the photon has @xmath130 for @xmath14-decay and @xmath264 for @xmath1-decay .",
    "particle data tables  @xcite give @xmath265 together with data on total widths we obtain @xmath266 large experimental uncertainty of branchings ( 52 ) prevents us from more detailed discussion of these decays .",
    "however , they may be useful and helpful in future studies . but even at present one can notice close equality of @xmath267 to other @xmath268-ratios of the previous section .",
    "this confirms universality of stronger isovector _ vs. _ isoscalar interaction for the photon , just at the expected quantitative level .",
    "all numerical estimations in this paper have been made under assumption that all necessary parameters are constant .",
    "those parameters are @xmath235 complex masses ( _ i.e. _ , masses and widths ) and mixing parameters @xmath47 ( or @xmath104 ) .",
    "such approach is analogous to the standard breit - wigner description of a resonance amplitude , with fixed values of energy ( mass ) and width .",
    "it is known to work quite well for description of narrow peaks , as @xmath1 or @xmath41 . however , to describe the broad @xmath0-peak one needs to account for @xmath40-dependence of , at least , the @xmath0-width . moreover , even to describe the @xmath269-interference in @xmath270 one seems to need the `` long tail '' of the @xmath1-resonance , with accounting for @xmath40-dependence of its width  @xcite .",
    "these examples show that , most probably , detailed description of , say , @xmath178 for extraction of the partial @xmath0-width and @xmath7-interference may require to consider the @xmath40-dependence of parameters ( at least , at future level of precision ) .",
    "another simplifying hypothesis used was the leading role of the @xmath7-mixing for isospin violation .",
    "a simple structure was assumed for bare amplitudes , corresponding to `` minimal '' violation of isospin , are evidently electromagnetic , they surely violate isospin .",
    "but the violation accounted for was only due to difference of charges @xmath271 , without account for difference of quark masses or other properties . ] .",
    "there are , however , arguments for necessity of more complicated structure , with direct violation of the isospin in bare amplitudes .    indeed , let us consider first the radiative decays",
    ". in terms of the constituent quarks their transition amplitudes are determined by magnetic moments of the quarks , which manifest themselves also in baryon magnetic moments .",
    "the factor 3 in relations ( 23),(31),(37 ) corresponds to the assumption that magnetic moments of @xmath272 are equal to their charges @xmath271 multiplied by the same factor . since this assumption implies also",
    "the ratio of the proton / neutron magnetic moments @xmath273 , we know that it is only approximate .",
    "the well established ( small ) deviation of this magnetic moments ratio from -3/2 gives evidence for difference of factors in the quark magnetic moments ( the same conclusion comes from magnetic moments of other baryons ) , due to different masses or because of other reasons - quark appears 5% larger than for lighter @xmath10-quark , contrary to familiar properties of normal magnetic moments .",
    "this can be viewed as evidence that ( constituent ) quarks may have anomalous magnetic moments . ] .",
    "thus , the factor 3 should be corrected , and the corrections can be extracted from existing data s , in agreement with the present experimental value ( 25 ) . ] .",
    "however , repeating the analysis of section 3 with these corrections shows that today they appear to be corrections to corrections in comparison with effects of @xmath7-mixing .",
    "arguments for direct isospin violation in @xmath17-decays look differently . it is essential here that both @xmath89 and @xmath90 have two flavour components , their couplings to photon being proportional just to charges @xmath274 .",
    "thus , each of the bare decay amplitudes is a combination of two flavour contributions . according to the constituent quark model ,",
    "every contribution due to annihilation of a pair @xmath275 is proportional to the product of @xmath276 and the corresponding short - range wave function @xmath277 .",
    "exact isospin conservation implies equality @xmath278 .",
    "however , the scaling relation ( 46 ) leads to the phenomenological dependence on the quark mass@xcite @xmath279 ( note that it would be @xmath280 for the coulomb - like potential ) .",
    "now , inequality of @xmath281 and @xmath282 should influence the amplitudes @xmath283 and deviate their ratio from 3 ( recall that we deal here with constituent quarks , so the correction should be at a level of several percents , not several times as it would be for current quark masses ) and suppresses @xmath284 , thus increasing the coefficient in eq.(42 ) .",
    "such changes are favourable , since they shift the theoretically expected intervals ( 50),(51 ) just so to adjust them to experimental values ( 48 ) . ] .",
    "of course , there are also some other corrections .",
    "_ e.g. _ , @xmath111 contains an admixture of strange quarks which may be described as mixing of @xmath1 and @xmath41 with mixing angle @xmath285 .",
    "corresponding relative corrections for decays of section 3 are of order @xmath286 .",
    "their influence appears even smaller than discussed above and may be necessary only at future levels of precision .",
    "results of the present paper may be briefly summarized as follows .    1 .   independently of a framework of any effective field theory , the @xmath7-mixing",
    "is completely determined by two universal parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 , both being , generally , complex . for the case of @xmath29-conservation ( or in the framework of effective field theory ) they may be made equal to each other , staying complex outside the effective field theory .",
    "experimental determination of the mixing parameter(s ) would allow to check models of isospin violation .",
    "it was known for many years that isospin violation , due to the @xmath7-mixing , should be enhanced in the forbidden decay @xmath287 ; later the same effect was suggested for the radiative decay @xmath8 ( its branching ratio may be unequal to that of @xmath9 due to interference of the direct decay and cascade decay @xmath288 ) . as shown here , the mixing should also affect all pairs of decays of @xmath232 to the same final state and decays of heavier particles with production of @xmath289 .",
    "the @xmath7-mixing influences various pairs of @xmath2-decays in a regular , correlated manner .",
    "such regularities agree with existing data on radiative decays and decays to @xmath17 , though achieved precision of data is insufficient for the firm conclusion . nevertheless , the data prefer re@xmath240 .",
    "this , on one side , supports enhancement of @xmath8 in comparison with @xmath241 and implies , on the other , that the direct @xmath7-coupling @xmath290 is complex .",
    "the universal nature of the mixing parameter will allow , at higher experimental accuracy , to separate mixing isospin violation due to @xmath7-transitions from direct isospin violation in amplitudes of `` bare '' ( unmixed ) states @xmath89 and @xmath291 .",
    "even present data give some evidence for necessity of such direct violating effects .",
    "thus , we can expect that in the near future the meson radiative decays with participation of @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 may indeed be attractive and useful for studying the @xmath7-mixing and other manifestations of isospin violation .    about forty years ago",
    ", in first years of the quark era , the radiative decays of mesons were suggested ( and really used ) as a mean to check that quarks inside baryons and mesons are the same  @xcite .",
    "now , forty years later , at a higher level of experimental precision and theoretical understanding , such decays may again provide new interesting information .",
    "this time the radiative decays might elucidate mechanisms of isospin violation .",
