    "to improve the spectral efficiency , current designs of wireless networks adopt universal frequency reuse where all the cells can share the same radio spectrum resources .",
    "however , universal frequency reuse comes at the cost of severe intercell interference ( ici ) , especially at cell - edge mobile stations ( ms ) . in the 3gpp lte - advanced standard , coordinated multi - point transmission / reception ( comp )",
    "is considered as an enabling technique to actively deal with the ici @xcite . in comp ,",
    "the coverage , throughput and efficiency of the multicell system can be significantly improved by fully coordinating and optimizing the concurrent transmissions from multiple base - stations ( bs ) to the mss @xcite .",
    "depending on the level of coordination among the coordinated cells , a comp system can operate under different modes , namely joint processing / joint transmission ( jp / jt ) , dynamic point selection ( dps ) , and coordinated scheduling / coordinated beamforming ( cs / cb ) @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the signals intended for a particular ms are simultaneously transmitted from multiple bss across cell sites .",
    "thus , jp / jt offers the benefit of large - scale bs cooperation @xcite .",
    "asymptotic performance of jp / jt has been analyzed in recent works through the large system analysis of coordinated multicell systems @xcite .",
    "although jp / jt can exploit the best performance from the comp system , it is the most complex mode in terms of signaling and synchronization among the bss @xcite . per the 3gpp lte - advanced release 11 , the jp / jt mode",
    "is normally assumed to be `` coherent '' , meaning that co - phasing of the signs from different coordinated transmission points is performed by means of precoding at the transmitter @xcite .",
    "thus , implementing jp / jt will need a high - resolution adjustable analog delay to each coordinated bs to cope with the delay variations .",
    "for this reason , it is difficult to fully realize the potential performance gains of coherent jp / jt , which may limit their applicability only to bss connected by a fast backhaul @xcite .",
    "in addition , coherent jp / jt requires inter - point phase information as part of the channel state information ( csi ) feedback from multiple points @xcite .",

    "cb requires csi feedback from multiple points @xcite .",
    "however , by exploiting channel reciprocality @xcite , optimal downlink",
    "cs / cb can be implemented if a bs knows the csi only to its connected mss @xcite .    in dps mode ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dps ] ) , the ms , at any one time , is being associated to a single bs .",
    "however , this single associated bs can dynamically change from time - frame to time - frame within a set of possible bss inside the cluster @xcite .",
    "comp dps provides a good trade - off between the transmission algorithm complexity , system performance and backhaul overhead , in comparison to jp / jt and cs / cb @xcite .",
    "in fact , the synchronization issue and the requirement of fast backhaul communications can be alleviated in the dps mode , compared to the jp / jt mode . in dps , each ms s data has to be available at all the possible bss ready for selection .",
    "in addition , the beamforming functionality is still needed to coordinate the transmission across the bss for interference control @xcite . to facilitate the interference control , dps demands",
    "similar csi feedback as cs / cb such that no inter - point phase information is required @xcite .",
    "in fact , when the user - bs association is determined , the dps mode becomes the cs / cb mode . compared to cs / cb",
    ", dps offers the advantage of site selection diversity , since dps can provide a `` soft - handoff '' solution to among the coordinated bss to quickly switch the best bs for association for each ms .",
    "however , it is not clear how a joint bs association strategy and beamforming design in the dps mode can be optimally determined to maximize the performance of the comp system . in this paper",
    ", we are interested in jointly optimizing the bs association strategy and linear beamforming design for a comp downlink system under the dps mode . with a set of target signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratios ( sinr ) at the mss ,",

    "uplink - downlink duality and iterative fixed - point iteration have been successfully exploited in @xcite to obtain optimal beamformers to either minimize the sum transmit power at the bss or maximize the minimum sinr at the mss .",
    "different to these previous studies , part of this work examines the application of uplink - downlink duality to optimize the multicell beamformers under the dps mode .    while the problem of joint bs association and beamforming design / power control in uplink transmission has been intensively studied @xcite , the counterpart problem in downlink transmission is not well understood .",
    "there are few prior studies in literature which deal with this downlink transmission problem . in @xcite ,",
    "the problem for downlink transmission has been investigated for the case of power control ( not including beamforming design ) .",
    "it is stated in @xcite that there is no pareto - optimal solution for the problem of joint bs association and beamforming design in the downlink .",
    "the work in @xcite tackled the problem of joint downlink beamforming , power control , and access point allocation in a congested system . in @xcite , the joint optimization of bs association and beamforming design",
    "was examined and a relaxing - and - rounding technique was proposed as a suboptimal solution to the binary variables indicating the bs association .",

    "the problem of joint bs assignment and power allocation for maximizing the minimum rate in a single - input single - output ( siso ) interference channel was investigated .",
    "a two - stage algorithm was proposed to iteratively find the bs assignment and power allocation for the users @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these works , our formulation and solution framework are to attain pareto - optimal joint bs association and beamforming design strategies with guaranteed sinrs at the mss .    in the context of finding the optimal beamforming design for power minimization",
    ", the optimization can be formulated as a nonconvex quadratic constrained quadratic programming ( qcqp ) problem @xcite . the nonconvex qcqp is then solved indirectly via convex semi - definite programming ( sdp ) relaxation @xcite or a transformation into a convex second - order conic programming ( socp ) problem @xcite .",
    "it will be shown later in this paper that it is not possible to transform the problems under consideration into a socp .",
    "thus , we rely on recent developments in nonconvex qcqp @xcite in joinly devising the optimal bs association strategy and beamforming design .      in this work ,",
    "we formulate the joint bs association and beamforming design problems as mixed integer programs , which contain the binary variables indicating the bs associations . to circumvent the difficulty in dealing with the binary variables and devise optimal joint bs association and beamforming designs , our proposed solution approaches , which also account for the main contributions of this paper , are as follows :    * we propose a relaxation method to solve these original mixed integer programs by relaxing all the binary variables to @xmath0 and focusing on optimizing the beamformers .",
    "these relaxed optimization problems are shown to be nonconvex qcqp .",
    "our analysis based the qcqp solution framework then shows that the relaxed problems can be solved optimally .",
    "* under the design objective of minimizing the weighted sum transmit power , the obtained solution from the relaxed problem is also optimal to the original problem .",
    "specifically , this solution indicates both the optimal bs association strategy and the optimal beamforming design for all mss .",
    "our proposed framework also indicates that any pareto - optimal solution can be obtained by properly adjusting the weight factors in the objective function of sum transmit power .",
    "* we propose two solution approaches based on the lagrangian duality and the dual uplink problem to find the optimal solution . via the dual uplink problem , we propose a distributed algorithm to obtain the optimal joint bs association and beamforming design . we show that the dps can be optimally implemented when a bs knows the csi only to users within its serving user set . * under the design objective of minimizing the per - bs transmit power margin , the optimality of the relaxed problem s solution to the original problem is not always observed .",
    "nevertheless , based on the obtained solution from the relaxed problem , a suboptimal solution to the original problem is then proposed .",
    "we observe that the performance gap between the suboptimal solution to the optimal one is negligible in simulations .",
    "simulation results also show that the resulting optimal joint bs association and beamforming design can significantly improve the performance of the comp system .",

    "<S> this paper examines a comp system where multiple base - stations ( bs ) employ coordinated beamforming to serve multiple mobile - stations ( ms ) . under the dynamic point selection mode , </S>",
    "<S> each ms can be assigned to only one bs at any time . </S>",
    "<S> this work then presents a solution framework to optimize the bs associations and coordinated beamformers for all mss . with target signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratios at the mss , </S>",
    "<S> the design objective is to minimize either the weighted sum transmit power or the per - bs transmit power margin . since the original optimization problems contain binary variables indicating the bs associations , finding their optimal solutions is a challenging task . to circumvent this difficulty </S>",
    "<S> , we first relax the original problems into new optimization problems by expanding their constraint sets . </S>",
    "<S> based on the nonconvex quadratic constrained quadratic programming framework , we show that these relaxed problems can be solved optimally . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , with the first design objective , the obtained solution from the relaxed problem is also optimal to the original problem . with the second design objective , a suboptimal solution to the original problem </S>",
    "<S> is then proposed , based on the obtained solution from the relaxed problem . </S>",
