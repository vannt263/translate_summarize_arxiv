    "close double white dwarfs ( cdwds ) are close compact binary stars composed of two white dwarfs .",
    "cdwds are of outstanding importance in the general astrophysical context .",
    "first , they are the most common type of close compact binary stars in the galaxy and since their orbital separations continuously decrease through the emission of gravitational waves , they are likely to determine the background noise level of future space - based gravitational wave interferometers , such as lisa @xcite . in addition , angular momentum loss through the emission of gravitational waves eventually leads to the merger of the two white dwarfs .",
    "if the resulting mass of the merger is @xmath61.4 , then this event is expected to lead to a type ia supernoave explosion @xcite .",
    "however , currently we do not fully understand how cdwds form .",
    "thus , predicting the merger rates of cdwds , or understanding their parameter distributions , or assessing the number of gravitational wave sources are problems that are still affected by serious uncertainties .",
    "the standard scenario for the formation of cdwds predicts that they are the descendants of main sequence binaries that evolve through two common envelope ( ce ) episodes @xcite .",
    "the first ce episode occurs when the initially more massive main sequence star evolves into a red giant and overfills its roche - lobe .",
    "dynamically unstable mass transfer from the giant onto the main sequence companion makes it to also fill its roche lobe .",
    "thus , both the core of the giant and the main sequence companion orbit inside an envelope that is composed mainly by the outer layers of the giant star . within the ce ,",
    "drag forces lead to a significant shrinkage of the orbit and the release of orbital energy eventually ejects the envelope , leaving behind a post - ce binary containing a white dwarf and a main sequence companion . the second ce phase begins when the latter evolves into a red giant , producing a cdwd with a typical orbital period of hours to days .",
    "even though the standard formation scenario of cdwds was proposed about three decades ago @xcite , population synthesis models of cdwds are still far from being able to reproduce essential characteristics of the observed population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is mostly because the ce phase involves a large number of hydrodynamic and thermodynamic processes acting over very wide ranges in time and length scales .",
    "consequently the ce is commonly described by simple parametrized models @xcite . to make things worse , it recently turned out to be unclear whether cdwds are formed through two ce episodes or by one process of stable conservative mass transfer followed by a ce phase @xcite .",
    "observationally , recent surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) or the sn ia progenitor survey ( spy ) have allowed the identification of large numbers of cdwds that have been used to constrain sn ia formation channels @xcite .",
    "however , these studies rely on monte carlo simulations aimed at reproducing the observational data , which suffer from the uncertainties above outlined .",
    "hence , the only way forward is to directly measure the orbital periods and two component masses of a large sample of cdwds , which allows obtaining direct constraints on their past evolution , and to thus provide the much needed observational input to test the theoretical models @xcite .",
    "this is only possible when analysing double - lined cdwds , which allows measuring the semi - amplitude velocities of the two components and hence provide a direct measure of the mass ratio ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or eclipsing systems , which allow measuring the component masses through the analysis of the observed light curves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    during the last few years 18 of such cdwds with measured orbital periods and components masses have been identified ( see table[t - dds ] ) . in this paper",
    "we derive the orbital periods and component masses of three additional cdwds ( sdssj031813.25010711.7 , he04101137 and wd0028474 ) , thus increasing the number of cdwds with measured parameters by @xmath720 per cent .",
    ".[t - dds ] orbital periods and component masses of the 18 previously known double - lined and/or eclipsing cdwds .",
    "the masses should be considered as best possible values when no errors are provided .",
    "this table supersedes table1 of @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this section we describe the method employed to measure the component masses of the white dwarfs of each binary .",
    "these were obtained applying three independent observational constraints .",
    "the first and most obvious is that the mass components need to comply with the measured mass ratios  see sect.[s - param ] .",
    "the second constraint comes from the h@xmath0 core ratio , i.e. the flux ratio between the depth of the h@xmath0 cores arising from the two white dwarf components .",
    "we obtained this ratio directly from the observed double - lined spectra ",
    "see fig.[f - spec ] and also sect.[s - obs ] . for each of our three cdwds we measured the h@xmath0 core ratio from all available individual spectra , where we determined the flux of each core as the minimum flux of the considered absorption line .",
    "we averaged the h@xmath0 core ratios derived from all available spectra , which were found to be nearly identical for each cdwd .",
    "we obtained the third constraint by model - fitting the observed cdwd spectra corrected from the orbital motion .",
    "more details are given below .",
    "obtained from the measured radial velocity semi - amplitudes ( see the right panel of fig.[f - periods ] ) . ]",
    "we used a set of 612 white dwarf model spectra from @xcite and summed the flux of each of them with the flux of each of the remaining spectra so that we obtained model spectra of 374544 double white dwarfs ( or 187272 if duplicates are discarded ) .",
    "the 612 model spectra included effective temperatures ranging from 6,000  k to 10,000  k in steps of 250k , from 10,000  k to 30,000  k in steps of 1,000  k , from 30,000  k to 70,000  k in steps of 5,000  k and 70,000  k to 100,000  k in steps of 10,000k , and surface gravities ranging between 6.5 and 9.5dex for each effective temperature . from each model we derived the h@xmath0 core ratio in the same way as described above .",
    "we then used the fitting routine of @xcite to fit the 374,544 spectra with the set of 612 models and derived effective temperatures and surface gravities for each of them .",
    "the synthetic double white dwarf spectra are the combined fluxes of two white dwarfs , hence the fitted paramater values are not representative of either white dwarf component .",
    "consequently , we will refer to them as `` combined '' values .",
    "these combined values can be compared to those obtained fitting the observed spectra of our three cdwds . to that end , we fitted all available uves spectra of resolving power 18500 ( the highest resolution among our data , see sect.[s - obs ] ) corrected from orbital motion of each cdwd .",
    "the resulting fits were found to agree within the errors in the three cases and we averaged the results to obtain the final combined values of effective temperature and surface gravity from the observed spectra .    the procedure outlined above allowed us to build a grid including h@xmath0 core ratios , mass ratios and combined effective temperatures and surface gravities for each of the 374,544 double white dwarf model spectra .",
    "given that each synthetic double white dwarf spectrum results from adding the fluxes of two individual white dwarf model spectra of known effective temperatures and surface gravities , the grid includes also these individual parameters for each white dwarf .",
    "we can easily derive masses from the effective temperature and surface gravities using white dwarf cooling sequences , hence we are also able to include the individual white dwarf component masses ( hence mass ratios ) for each double white dwarf model in the grid .",
    "the masses were obtained using the cooling sequences of @xcite for carbon - oxygen white dwarfs ( @xmath8 between @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , @xcite for oxygen - neon white dwarfs ( @xmath11 ) and @xcite for helium core white dwarfs ( @xmath12 ) .    for each cdwd we used the derived mass ratio , the combined fitted effective temperatures and surface gravities from the observed uves spectra and the measured h@xmath0 core ratio to select all double white dwarf models satisfying these conditions within the grid . from the models that survived these cuts we obtained the mass and effective temperature ranges for each white dwarf component .",
    "the resulting white dwarf mass ranges obtained in this way are shown in fig.[f - masses ] for our three cdwds .",
    "the masses and effective temperature values are indicated in table[t - param ] .",
    "inspection of table[t - param ] reveals that the more massive white dwarf in wd0028474 is the hotter ( younger ) one . for this to be the case @xcite claim that such systems ( we quote literally ) `` must have undergone a period of conservative mass transfer , during which the initial mass ratio was reversed , so that the more evolved star became the less massive , and produced the less massive white dwarf '' .",
    "we can use the difference in systemic velocities of the two white dwarfs , @xmath13 , as a consistency check of our derived masses .",
    "this is because the difference in systemic velocities is related to the difference in gravitational redshifts of the two white dwarfs .",
    "the gravitational redshift of white dwarfs ( in km / s ) is given by @xmath14 where the mass and radius are expressed in solar units @xcite . in a close binary composed of two",
    "white dwarfs the above equation becomes @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the orbital separation , also given in solar radii .",
    "this expression takes into account the gravitational potential acting on the white dwarf owing to the other white dwarf ( we have not included the effects caused by the difference in transverse doppler shifts , since these are negligible in these binaries ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath17 should be equal to the difference in systemic velocities @xmath13 .    adopting the masses listed in table[t - param ] , using kepler s third law to derive the orbital separations , and employing the mass - radius relation of @xcite we find @xmath18  km / s for wd0028474 , @xmath19  km / s for sdssj03180107 and @xmath20  km / s for he04101137 .",
    "these values are in excellent agreement with the difference in systemic velocities : @xmath21  km / s for wd0028474 , @xmath22  km / s for sdssj3180107 and @xmath23  km / s for he04101137 .",
    "this result indicates that our method for deriving the component masses of the three cdwds studied in this work is reliable .",
    "the orbital separation of a cdwd decreases in time due to the emission of gravitational waves until it eventually merges .",
    "the time in myr needed for such an event is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the orbital period in days and the masses are in units of @xcite .",
    "here we make use of the orbital periods and component masses determined in the previous sections to estimate when our three cdwds will merge .",
    "we obtain 14.6 , 1326 and 38.4  gyr for wd0028474 , sdssj03180107 and he04101137 , respectively .",
    "thus , in all cases more than the hubble time is needed to merge .",
    "the combined masses of the three cdwds do not exceed the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "hence , they are expected to become single massive ( @xmath60.9 ) white dwarfs .",
    "we have presented intense follow - up spectroscopy of three double - lined binary white dwarfs .",
    "analysing their spectra we have been able to derive precise values of the orbital periods and mass ratios .",
    "we have also derived the white dwarf component masses and effective temperatures of each binary applying a new method based on mass ratio , h@xmath0 core ratio and spectral model - fitting constraints .",
    "the three systems will need more than the hubble time to merge .",
    "after this they are expected to become single massive ( @xmath60.9 ) white dwarfs .",
    "our work increases the number of double white dwarfs with available orbital periods and component masses by @xmath720 per cent , to a total of 21 systems . reconstructing the evolution of these objects",
    "is expected to dramatically help in providing the much needed new insights into the formation of close double white dwarfs , which is also essential to predict the rates of type ia supernovae produced by the double - degenerate channel @xcite .",
