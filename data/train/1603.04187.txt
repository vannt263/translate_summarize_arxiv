    "this paper is the fourth of a series started by the first two authors @xcite concerning several number theoretical problems involving linear difference equations , called mahler s equations , as well as underlying structures associated with automata theory .",
    "we investigate here a class of analytic functions introduced by siegel @xcite in his landmark 1929 paper under the name of @xmath0-functions .",
    "let us recall that @xmath2 is a @xmath0-function if it satisfies the following conditions .",
    "its coefficients @xmath3 are algebraic numbers and there exists a positive real number @xmath4 such that for every non - negative integer @xmath5 :    * the moduli of all galois conjugates of @xmath3 are at most @xmath6 .",
    "* there exists a sequence of positive integers @xmath7 such that @xmath8 is an algebraic integer for all @xmath9 , @xmath10 . * the function @xmath11 satisfies a linear differential equation with coefficients in @xmath12 .",
    "their study leads to a remarkable interplay between number theory , algebraic geometry , combinatorics , and the study of linear differential equations ( see @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the algebraic relations over @xmath13 that may or may not exist between @xmath0-functions . in this respect ,",
    "our main aim is to develop a new method for proving algebraic independence of such functions .",
    "our first motivation is related to transcendence theory .",
    "a large part of the theory is actually devoted to the study of algebraic relations over @xmath14 between periods defined by polynomial inequalities with rational coefficients .",
    "most complex numbers of interest to arithmeticians turn out to be periods . ] . unfortunately , this essentially remains _",
    "terra incognita_. at least conjecturally , @xmath0-functions may be thought of as their functional counterpart ( smooth algebraic deformations of periods ) .",
    "understanding algebraic relations among @xmath0-functions thus appears to be a first step in this direction and , first of all , a much more tractable problem .",
    "for instance , a conjecture of kontsevich @xcite ( see also @xcite ) claims that any algebraic relation between periods can be derived from the three fundamental operations associated with integration : additivity , change of variables , and stokes formula .",
    "it is considered completely out of reach by specialists , but recently ayoub @xcite proved a functional version of the conjecture ( see also @xcite ) . despite the depth of this result",
    ", it does not help that much in deciding whether given @xmath0-functions are or are not algebraically independent .",
    "a second motivation finds its source in enumerative combinatorics .",
    "indeed , most generating series that have been studied so far by combinatorists turn out to be @xmath0-functions . to some extent ,",
    "the nature of a generating series reflects the underlying structure of the objects it counts ( see @xcite ) . by nature , we mean whether the generating series is rational , algebraic , or @xmath15-finite . in the same line , algebraic independence of generating series",
    "can be considered as a reasonable way to measure how distinct families of combinatorial objects may be ( un)related . though combinatorists have a very long tradition of proving transcendence of generating functions , it seems that algebraic independence has never been studied so far in this setting .",
    "our approach rests on the following observation : a @xmath0-function often comes with not just a single linear differential equation , but also sometimes with an infinite family of linear difference equations obtained by reduction modulo prime ideals .",
    "let us formalize this claim somewhat .",
    "let @xmath16 be a number field , @xmath17 be a @xmath0-function in @xmath18 , and let us denote by @xmath19 the ring of integers of @xmath16 . for prime ideals",
    "@xmath20 of @xmath19 such that all coefficients of @xmath11 belong to the localization of @xmath19 at @xmath20 , it makes sense to consider the reduction of @xmath11 modulo @xmath20 : @xmath21 \\ , .\\ ] ] when @xmath20 is above the prime @xmath1 , the residue field @xmath22 is a finite field of characteristic @xmath1 , and the linear difference equation mentioned above is of the form : @xmath23 where @xmath24 belong to @xmath25 . that is , a linear difference equation associated with the frobenius endomorphism @xmath26 .",
    "note that @xmath27 satisfies an equation of the form if , and only if , it is algebraic over @xmath25 .",
    "a theorem of furstenberg @xcite and deligne @xcite shows that this holds true for all diagonals of multivariate algebraic power series and almost every prime ideals - functions ( see for instance @xcite ) . ] .",
    "furthermore , classical conjectures of bombieri and dwork would imply that this should also be the case for any globally bounded @xmath0-functions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note that even when a @xmath0-function is not globally bounded , but can still be reduced modulo @xmath20 for infinitely many prime ideals @xmath20 , a similar situation may be expected . for instance , the hypergeometric function @xmath28\\ ] ] is not globally bounded but satisfies a relation of the form for all prime numbers congruent to @xmath29 modulo @xmath30 ( see section [ sec : hyp ] ) .",
    "a case of specific interest is when @xmath27 satisfies a linear difference equation of order one with respect to a power of the frobenius .",
    "then one obtains a simpler equation of the form : @xmath31 for some positive integer @xmath32 and some rational fraction @xmath33 in @xmath25 . as explained in section [ sec : ldks ] , these equations lead to congruences for the coefficients of @xmath11 that are reminiscent to a classical theorem of lucas @xcite on binomial coefficients and the so - called @xmath1-lucas congruences . at first glance , it may seem somewhat miraculous that a @xmath0-function could satisfy such congruences for infinitely many prime ideals .",
    "surprisingly enough , we will show that this situation occurs remarkably often .",
    "for instance , motivated by the search of differential operators associated with particular families of calabi - yau varieties , almkvist _",
    "@xcite gave a list of more than 400 differential operators selected as potential candidates .",
    "they all have a unique solution analytic at the origin and it turns out that more than fifty percent of these analytic solutions do satisfy lucas - type congruences ( see the discussion in section  [ section : tables ] ) .",
    "another interesting example is due to samol and van straten @xcite . consider a laurent polynomial @xmath34,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 in @xmath38 .",
    "then the newton polyhedron of @xmath39 is the convex hull of @xmath40 in @xmath41 . in @xcite",
    ", it is proved that if @xmath42 is a laurent polynomial in @xmath43 $ ] such that the origin is the only interior integral point of the newton polyhedron of @xmath39 , then the sequence of the constant terms of its powers @xmath44_{\\mathbf{0}})_{n\\geq 0}$ ] has the @xmath1-lucas property for all primes @xmath1 .",
    "more generally , there is a long tradition ( and a corresponding extensive literature ) in proving that some sequences of natural numbers satisfy the @xmath1-lucas property or some related congruences .",
    "most classical sequences which are known to enjoy the @xmath1-lucas property turn out to be multisums of products of binomial coefficients such as , for example , the apry numbers @xmath45 other classical examples are ratios of factorials such as @xmath46 however , the known proofs are quite different and strongly depend on the particular forms of the binomial coefficients and of the number of sums involved in those sequences .",
    "we note that some attempts to obtain more systematic results can be found in @xcite and more recently in @xcite .",
    "we also refer the reader to @xcite for a recent survey , including many references , about @xmath1-lucas congruences . in section [ sec : mgh ] , we provide a way to unify many proofs , as well as to obtain a lot of new examples .",
    "we introduce a family of multivariate hypergeometric series and study their @xmath1-adic properties . using specializations of these series , we are able to prove in section [ sec : appli ] that a large variety of classical families of @xmath0-functions actually satisfy such congruences .",
    "this includes families of hypergeometric series and generating series associated with multisums of products of binomial coefficients .",
    "this also includes more exotic examples such as @xmath47    let @xmath48 be power series such that holds for all elements in an infinite set @xmath49 of prime ideals and for rational fractions @xmath33 whose height is in @xmath50 for a precise definition of the height of a rational fraction and section [ sec : ldks ] for precise conditions imposed upon @xmath48 . ] . in section [ sec : kolchin ]",
    "we prove an algebraic independence criterion , theorem [ thm : ind ] , saying that @xmath51 are algebraically dependent over @xmath52 if , and only if , there exist integers @xmath53 , not all zero , such that : @xmath54 thus if @xmath51 are algebraically dependent , they should satisfy a very special kind of relation : a laurent monomial is equal to a rational fraction .",
    "this kind of result is usually attached to the name of kolchin . at this point , it is often possible to apply asymptotic techniques and analysis of singularities , as described in section [ sec : sing ] , to easily deduce a contradiction and finally prove that the functions @xmath48 are algebraically independent over @xmath52 .",
    "_ since @xmath0-functions do satisfy linear differential equations , differential galois theory provides a natural framework to look at these questions .",
    "for instance , it leads to strong results concerning hypergeometric functions @xcite .",
    "however , the major drawback of this approach is that things become increasingly tricky when working with differential equations of higher orders . given some @xmath0-functions @xmath48 , it may be non - trivial to determine the differential galois group associated with a differential operator annihilating these functions .",
    "the method developed in this paper follows a totally different road .",
    "an important feature is that , contrary to what would happen using differential galois theory , we do not have to care about the derivatives of the functions @xmath48 .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that in order to apply theorem [ thm : ind ] , we do not even need that the functions @xmath48 satisfy linear differential equations .",
    "we only need properties about their reduction modulo prime ideals .",
    "as described in sections [ sec : ldks ] and [ sec : kolchin ] , all of this makes perfect sense in the general framework of a dedekind domain .",
    "however , we only focus in this paper on applications of our method to @xmath0-functions .",
    "_    the present work was initiated with the following concrete example .",
    "given a positive integer @xmath55 , the function @xmath56 is a @xmath0-function annihilated by the differential operator @xmath57 , where @xmath58 . in 1980 , stanley @xcite conjectured that the @xmath59 s are transcendental over @xmath52 unless for @xmath60 , in which case we have @xmath61 .",
    "he also proved the transcendence in the case where @xmath55 is even .",
    "the conjecture was solved independently by flajolet @xcite and by sharif and woodcock @xcite with totally different methods . incidentally , this result is also a consequence of work of beukers and heckman @xcite concerning generalized hypergeometric series .",
    "let us briefly describe these different proofs .",
    "we assume in the sequel that @xmath62 .    *",
    "the proof of flajolet is based on asymptotics .",
    "indeed , it is known that for an algebraic function @xmath63 , one has : @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 is an algebraic number and the @xmath68 s and @xmath69 s are algebraic with @xmath70 . on the other hand , stirling formula leads to the following asymptotics @xmath71 a simple comparison between these two asymptotics shows that @xmath59 can not be algebraic when @xmath55 is even , as already observed by stanley in @xcite .",
    "flajolet @xcite shows that it also leads to the same conclusion for odd @xmath55 , but then it requires the transcendence of @xmath72 .",
    "* the proof of sharif and woodcock is based on the lucas theorem previously mentioned .",
    "indeed , lucas theorem on binomial coefficients implies that @xmath73 for all prime numbers @xmath1 , all non - negative integers @xmath5 and all @xmath9 , @xmath74 .",
    "this leads to the algebraic equation : @xmath75 where @xmath76 . in @xcite , sharif and woodcock",
    "prove that the degree of algebraicity of @xmath77 can not remains bounded when @xmath1 runs along the primes , which ensures the transcendence of @xmath59 .",
    "* the proof based on the work of beukers and heckman used the fact that @xmath78\\ ] ] is a hypergeometric function .",
    "then it is easy to see that @xmath59 fails the beautiful interlacing criterion proved in @xcite . in consequence ,",
    "the differential galois groups associated with the @xmath59 s are all infinite and these functions are thus transcendental .",
    "though there are three different ways to obtain the transcendence of @xmath59 , not much was apparently known about their algebraic independence .",
    "roughly , our approach can be summed up by saying that ( ii ) + ( i ) leads to algebraic independence in a rather straightforward manner , while ( iii ) would be the more usual method . in this line",
    ", we will complete in section  [ sec : sing ] the result of @xcite , proving that the functions @xmath59 are all algebraically independent .    to give a flavor of the kind of results we can obtain , we just add the following two examples .",
    "they correspond respectively to theorems [ thm : appli1 ] and [ thm : prop3 ] proved in the sequel .",
    "the first one concerns several families of generating series associated with apry numbers , franel numbers , and some of their generalizations .",
