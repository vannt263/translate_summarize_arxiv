    "with the emerging experimental studies of ultra - cold atoms in a parabolic trap and a periodic optical lattice potential @xcite ( the wavelength of the optical potential is much smaller than the dimensions of the trap ) , new possibilities for studying the physics of interacting bosons have emerged . at equilibrium , the bosons can undergo a transition from a superfluid to an insulator as the strength of the optical potential is increased  @xcite .",
    "however , the facile tunability and long characteristic time scales of these systems also offer an opportunity to investigate non - equilibrium dynamical regimes that have not been accessible before . in this context",
    ", there have been a few recent theoretical studies of the dynamics of bosons in a periodic potential : ref .   computed the oscillation frequency of the center of mass of a superfluid state of bosons , while some non - equilibrium issues were addressed in papers @xcite which appeared while this paper was being completed .",
    "a description of the purpose of this paper requires an understanding of the different parameter regimes of the boson system , which we will assume is well described by the single - band hubbard model : @xmath1 .",
    "\\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath2 is a canonical bose annihilation operator on sites of the optical lattice ( `` wells '' ) labeled by the integer @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the tunneling amplitude between neighboring lattice sites , @xmath5 in the repulsive interaction energy between bosons in the same lattice minimum , and @xmath6 is a smooth external potential which we will take to be parabolic .",
    "we will mainly consider the case of a one - dimensional optical lattice , relevant to the experiments of ref .  , but generalization to higher dimensions is possible .",
    "the form of @xmath6 and the chemical potential of the bosons determine another important parameter : @xmath7 , the mean number of bosons at the central site ( more precisely , at the site where @xmath6 is smallest ) ; we shall mainly consider the case @xmath8 here .",
    "a dimensionless measure of the strength of the interactions between the bosons is the coupling @xmath9 the different physical regimes of @xmath10 are also conveniently dilineated by the values of @xmath11 .",
    "when the interactions between the bosons are strong enough , @xmath12 , the ground state of @xmath10 undergoes a quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a mott insulator ( see appendix  [ app : mft ] ) .",
    "it is known that @xcite : @xmath13 so for the case where @xmath7 is large , there is a wide regime , @xmath14 , where the interactions between the bosons are very strong , but the ground state is nevertheless a superfluid .",
    "a description of the dynamical properties of @xmath10 in this regime is one of central purposes of this paper .",
    "for @xmath7 large , and @xmath11 smaller than @xmath15 , it is widely accepted @xcite that the low temperature dynamics of @xmath10 can be described by treating the operator @xmath16 as a classical @xmath17-number .",
    "( we will investigate the conditions for the validity of this classical approximation more carefully in section  [ sec : two ] , where we will also discuss the time range over which it can be applied . )",
    "more precisely , we introduce the dimensionless complex dynamical variable @xmath18 whose value is a measure of @xmath19 ; then its dynamics is described by the classical hamiltonian @xmath20 here , and henceforth , we measure time in units of @xmath21 . the resulting equations of motion are , of course , a discrete version of the familiar gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equations .",
    "we will often impose a parabolic confining potential , in which case @xmath22 a nonuniform potential @xmath6 also can lead to localization of bosons in separate wells ; in particular , even without interaction ( @xmath23 ) , when @xmath24 the eigenmodes of ( @xmath25 ) become localized .",
    "note that this localization is a purely semiclassical effect , described by the gp equations .",
    "if @xmath6 is smooth then for @xmath12 , the system undergoes a transition to nonuniform insulating state  @xcite .    describing the non - equilibrium quantum bose dynamics for @xmath26",
    "is now reduced to a problem of integrating the classical equations of motion implied by ( [ 1b],[poisson ] ) .",
    "however , it remains to specify the initial conditions for the classical equations ; these clearly depend upon the physical situations of interest , and we shall consider here two distinct cases , which are discussed in the following subsections      consider the physical situation ( of current experimental interest  @xcite ) where for @xmath27 the bosons are in a mott insulating state with @xmath12 , and at time @xmath28 the optical lattice potential is suddenly reduced so that @xmath26 for all @xmath29 .",
    "clearly , the gp equations should apply for @xmath30 , and the mott insulating",
    "initial state will impose initial conditions which we now describe .",
    "the required initial conditions are readily deduced by thinking about the full quantum heisenberg equations of motion for @xmath31 implied by @xmath10 . by integrating these equations , one can",
    ", in principle , relate any observable to the expectation values of products of powers of @xmath32 and @xmath33 . for the mott insulator with @xmath34",
    "these expectation values have a very simple structure : they factorize into products of expectation values on each site , and are non - zero only if the number of creation and annihilation operators on each site are equal .",
    "furthermore , for large @xmath7 , we can also ignore the ordering of the @xmath2 and @xmath35 operators on each site , and _",
    "e.g. _ we obtain to leading order in @xmath36 : @xmath37 where we have accounted for a possible spatial inhomogeneity by introducing @xmath38 ( a number of order @xmath7 ) , the number of bosons at site @xmath3 in the mott insulator . in terms of the classical variables",
    "@xmath39 , the @xmath28 expectation values in ( [ ev ] ) are easy to reproduce .",
    "we simply choose @xmath40 where the @xmath41 are _ independent random variables _ which are uniformly distributed between @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "in this manner , we have mapped the fully deterministic quantum time evolution of @xmath10 to the stochastic and classical time evolution of @xmath44 . in practice ,",
    "the procedure is then as follows : choose a large ensemble of initial values of @xmath41 , and deterministically evolve @xmath44 for each such initial condition ; the expectation value of any quantum observable at time @xmath45 is then given by the average value of the corresponding classical observable at time @xmath45 , with the average being taken over the random variables @xmath41 . in particular @xmath46 where we have indicated that the angular brackets on the left represent a traditional quantum expectation value , while those on the right represent an average over the independent variables @xmath41 specified by ( [ ev1 ] ) at time @xmath28 .",
    "we will henceforth implicitly assume that all angular brackets have the meaning specified in ( [ ev2 ] ) , depending upon whether they contain quantum or classical variables .",
    "an important property of ( [ ev2 ] ) is that while we must have @xmath47 for a non - zero result at @xmath28 , this is no longer true for @xmath48 . in particular , non - zero correlations can develop for large @xmath49 as time evolves , corresponding to a restoration of phase coherence . indeed the ground state for @xmath50 is superfluid and thermalization must lead to increase of the phase correlations .",
    "however , in this paper we show , that even without relaxation the coherence can be restored dynamically .",
    "( of course , as we are looking at one dimensional systems and the final state is expected to be thermalized at a non - zero temperature , the phase correlations can not be truly long - range and must decay exponentially at large enough scales : however , guided by the experimental situation , we will look at relatively small systems for which this is not an issue . )",
    "describing the dynamics of the restoration of this phase coherence is also a central purpose of this paper .",
    "we shall characterize the phase coherence by studying the expectation value of @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the number of lattice sites ( for a nonuniform external potential @xmath6 , @xmath52 is just the ratio of the total number of bosons to the number of bosons in central well ) , and @xmath53 is some suitably chosen weight function .",
    "observables closely related to @xmath54 are measured upon detecting the atoms after releasing the trap . at time @xmath28 , @xmath55 , and we will be interested in the deviations of @xmath56 from this value for @xmath29 , an increase corresponding to an enhancement of superfluid phase coherence .",
    "we note , in passing , that a closely related procedure was used earlier @xcite to describe the onset of phase coherence after a sudden quench from high temperature ; here , we are always at zero temperature , and move into a superfluid parameter regime by a sudden change in the value of @xmath11",
    ".    we will begin our analysis of the structure of @xmath56 by considering the case with two wells ( @xmath57 ) in section  [ sec : twomott ] .",
    "for the weakly interacting case ( @xmath58 ) , @xmath56 exhibits josephson oscillations with a period of order unity ; the weak interactions lead to a decay of oscillations with a slow ( @xmath59 ) saturation of the coherence at a steady - state value at a time scale @xmath60 . for @xmath61",
    "the oscillations are suppressed and @xmath56 saturates at @xmath62 , which is , in fact , shorter than a single tunneling time .",
    "for this two lattice site case we can also obtain a complete solution for @xmath56 for the quantum hamiltonian @xmath10 ( described in section  [ sec : quantum ] ) , and this allows a detailed analysis on the regime of validity of the semiclassical gp equations .",
    "we show that the semiclassical approach is valid for two lattice sites when @xmath7 is large and @xmath63 .",
    "this is , in fact , a general result which implies that the quantum mechanics becomes important when time exceeds inverse energy level spacing . for more than two lattice sites , the energy splitting scales as the inverse of the total number of particles and at @xmath64 ,",
    "the semiclassical conditions are virtually always fulfilled .",
    "it is surprising that even with a small number of particles @xmath65 , and weak interactions , the gp equations give an excellent description of the system evolution , apart from overall numerical prefactor @xmath66 , which is not small in this case .",
    "the restoration of coherence is also studied in the many well case in section  [ sec : manymott ] .",
    "we discuss the case without an external potential in section  [ sec : pbc ] ; with an equal number of particles initially in all the wells , phase correlations develop only in the interacting case ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "this is true for both periodic and open boundary conditions .",
    "similar to the two well case , in the weakly interacting regime phase correlations will oscillate in time .",
    "however these oscillations will be periodic only for particular number of wells : @xmath68 for periodic boundary conditions and @xmath69 for open boundary conditions .",
    "for other numbers of wells , the oscillations are chaotic . as for the two well case , a stronger interaction results in decay of correlations in time , leading to the steady state .",
    "next , in section  [ sec : parabola ] , we consider the restoration of phase coherence for the experimentally important case of a parabolic potential .",
    "the results are quite different for this case , and phase correlations develop even without interactions . in a weak parabolic potential , @xmath56 oscillates with a frequency which scales as the square root of the parabolicity , @xmath70 .",
    "this frequency is closely related to the oscillation frequency discussed recently by kramer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for the case where the center of mass of the atomic gas is displaced . in the present situation",
    ", there is no displacement of the center of mass , but the same oscillation is excited upon a sudden change in the value of @xmath11 . the oscillations decay even at @xmath23 ; weak or intermediate interactions @xmath71 do not change the noninteracting picture much . the amplitude of the oscillations become more pronounced for @xmath72 , but for @xmath61 the oscillations are suppressed as for the flat potential .",
    "while this work was being completed , we became aware of related results of altman and auerbach also addressing the restoration of phase coherence in a mott insulator .",
    "however , there are some significant differences in the physical situations being addressed . above",
    ", we have considered a system deep in the mott insulating phase ( with @xmath34 ) taken suddenly to parameters for which the ground state was deep in the superfluid phase ( with @xmath73 ) .",
    "in contrast , ref .",
    "consider the case when both the initial and final values of @xmath11 were not too far from @xmath15 , but remained on opposite sides of it . for @xmath11 close to @xmath15 , and at temperatures not too small , a `` relativistic gross - pitaevski '' equation had been proposed in ref .   as a description of the `` _ bose molasses _ '' dynamics of the order parameter .",
    "the conditions under which oscillations in the amplitude of the order parameter would be underdamped were also presented@xcite .",
    "altman and auerbach @xcite advocated that the same equations could describe the time evolution of the amplitude of the order parameter as it evolved from the mott insulator ( with zero amplitude ) to the superfluid ( with finite amplitude ) at zero temperature .",
    "we review issues related to the damping of the amplitude mode in appendix  [ app : amp ] .",
    "altman and auerbach  @xcite also considered the situation without an external potential ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "we have noted above that such a potential changed our results significantly ; in appendix  [ app : mft ] we discuss the significant role of the external potential in the equilibrium properties for @xmath75 .      a second set of initial conditions we consider is the case in which the parameter values always correspond to a superfluid ground state _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath26 . for time @xmath76",
    "we imagine that @xmath11 takes some fixed value and the phases @xmath41 have some known set of fixed , _",
    "non - random _ values at @xmath28 and we follow the subsequent evolution of the bosons using the discrete gp equation . the phase imprint can be experimentally achieved by e.g. applying a short ( compared to a single tunneling time ) pulse of external field to the condensate .",
    "a case of special interest will be when there is a relative @xmath0 phase shift between neighboring wells : @xmath77 for two wells with equal @xmath38 and relatively small @xmath11 , this state is metastable ( this is also the case for even @xmath52 and periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "however , if the interaction @xmath11 becomes larger than a critical value , this equilibrium becomes unstable and the bosons spontaneously form a `` dipole '' state  @xcite in which most of them occupy one of the two wells ( see section  [ sec : twomod ] ) . upon accounting for quantum tunneling in a system with a finite number of bosons , the state obtained",
    "is a superposition of the two dipole states restoring translational symmetry .",
    "however , in case of infinite number of wells ( see section  [ sec : manymod ] ) the tunneling between the two dipole configurations is negligible and translational symmetry is broken by the appearance of a density wave of bosons with a period of two lattice spacings .",
    "this effect is similar to that studied in ref .   for the case of a mott insulator in a strong electric field .",
    "related to this instability is a very interesting possibility of forming a schrdinger cat state  @xcite .",
    "we show in section  [ sec : manymod ] that if the system is initially in the `` @xmath0 state '' , and the interaction is slowly increased , then at certain point _",
    "all _ the bosons spontaneously move into one of the wells . if quantum mechanical corrections are taken into account then the final configuration is the superposition of the states with all bosons in one of the wells .",
    "this effect opens the possibility of dynamical forming of a strongly entangled state of bosons .",
    "the comparison between the semiclassical and quantum theory of the two - well system has been presented earlier by milburn _",
    "@xcite , although for initial conditions different from those we shall consider here .",
    "first we will focus on the semiclassical description of the two well system , when the total number of bosons is much greater than 1 . in this case the gross - pitaevskii equations implied by ( [ 1b ] ) and ( [ poisson ] ) are @xmath78 is a constant of the motion ; with our normalization for @xmath39 described above ( [ 1b ] ) , we have @xmath79 .",
    "we use the parameterization : @xmath80 note that only the relative phase of @xmath81 and @xmath82 is an observable . substituting ( [ 4 ] ) into ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) we obtain : @xmath83    after further manipulation this system reduces to a single second order differential equation for the continuous variable @xmath84 :    @xmath85    with initial conditions : @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "similar equations were derived in  @xcite . without interaction ( @xmath23 )",
    "we have a situation of a single josephson junction described by a free harmonic oscillator .",
    "the interaction @xmath11 is responsible for the anharmonicity .",
    "note that for @xmath71 the solutions @xmath88 , @xmath89 are stationary ; _",
    "i.e. _ the phase difference between the two wells can be either @xmath42 or @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand for @xmath90 the solution with @xmath91 becomes unstable  @xcite , and instead the new minima appear at @xmath92    we will now consider the properties of the two well system for the two classes of initial conditions discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] in turn .",
    "each subsection below also contains a comparison with the exact results obtained by a full quantum solution of @xmath10 .      as in section",
    "[ sec : mottini ] , let us assume that initially the two condensates are completely uncoupled .",
    "we will consider their evolution in the semiclassical and quantum calculations in turn :      > from the discussion in section  [ sec : mottini ] , we have @xmath93 and @xmath94 is a uniform random variable",
    ". we will study the correlation between @xmath81 and @xmath82 as a function of time .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath95 where the average is taken over all possible initial phases @xmath94 .",
    "the correlator is proportional to the product of the coupling constant @xmath11 and the variance of @xmath84 , reflecting the usual phase - number uncertainty relation .    before proceeding with quantitative analysis",
    "let us argue qualitatively what happens with the system .",
    "suppose @xmath96 .",
    "then ( [ 9 ] ) is equivalent to the motion of a particle in a harmonic potential with random initial velocity . because the frequency of the harmonic oscillator does nt depend on the amplitude",
    ", @xmath97 is a periodic function of time with @xmath98 .",
    "if @xmath11 is still small but not negligible , then ( [ 9 ] ) still describes motion in a harmonic potential , which , however , depends on the initial conditions . as a result the oscillations of @xmath97 become quasiperiodic and decay with time . in the limit of large @xmath11",
    "the oscillations completely disappear and the steady state solution develops during the time @xmath99 .    for weak coupling @xmath11 , equation ( [ 9 ] ) can be solved explicitly .",
    "thus for @xmath23 @xmath100    for small @xmath11 the approximate analytical solution is :    @xmath101    it is easy to see that at large @xmath45 we have the following asymptotic behavior : @xmath102,\\label{13 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     as a function of time .",

    "the insert on the top graph has a different time scale.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    so that the variance of @xmath84 approaches the steady state value of one fourth .",
    "we note that the amplitude of oscillations decays with time as @xmath59 and on top of that there are beats with the characteristic frequency @xmath103 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . for large @xmath11 the oscillations decay",
    "very rapidly and @xmath97 quickly saturates at the steady state value , which decreases with @xmath11 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "let us now study the quantum case .",
    "the heisenberg equations of motion are : @xmath104 , \\label{15a}\\ ] ] where square brackets denote commutator , @xmath105 and the hamiltonian @xmath106 is given by ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "it turns to be convenient to use the following heisenberg operators : @xmath107 we introduce hats over the operators to distinguish them from numbers appearing in the semiclassical treatment and expectation values of the operators .",
    "it is easy to see that the following combination @xmath108 commutes with the hamiltonian . using this fact the system ( [ 15a ] )",
    "can be reduced to a single differential equation : @xmath109 with the initial conditions : @xmath110 in the equations above @xmath111 denotes the anticommutator , and the subindex @xmath112 means time - independent schrdinger operators .",
    "we note that the second relation in ( [ 18 ] ) holds for all times if we use @xmath113 instead of @xmath114 .    in the noninteracting case ( @xmath23 )",
    "the solution of ( [ 17 ] ) is : @xmath115 the initial conditions corresponding to the ground state for @xmath116 is @xmath117 .",
    "note that such a state is possible only if @xmath7 is even .",
    "the generalization for @xmath7 odd is straightforward , but we will not do it here , since our major goal is to compare quantum and semiclassical pictures .",
    "simple computation shows that @xmath118 comparing ( [ 20 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) we see that the only difference between the semiclassical and quantum results in the noninteracting case is the presence of an extra numerical factor @xmath119 in ( [ 20 ] ) .    in the weakly interacting regime ( @xmath64 ) we can neglect terms proportional to @xmath120 .",

    "it is important to note that this is a purely semiclassical transition in this case , because it is derived in the gross - pitaevskii picture .",
    "the `` quantum mechanics '' here originates from the wave nature of the classical field @xmath185 . if the average number of bosons per well is much larger than one , then the semiclassical picture , where number of bosons and their phase commute , holds until the typical fluctuations of @xmath186 becomes of the order of @xmath187",

    "in particular , degenerate levels with @xmath182 can be safely thrown away .",
    "if @xmath198 is constant , then summation over @xmath199 ensures that the major contribution comes from @xmath200 ; therefore @xmath166 contains mostly harmonics with @xmath201 , @xmath202 , etc .",
    ", with the strongest weight at the smallest frequency .",
    "note that at small energies and weak parabolicity the lowest energy levels are approximately equally spaced , therefore the whole expression for @xmath166 will be a quasi - periodic function of a frequency @xmath203 .",
    "however , because this equidistance is not exact , the periodicity will be only approximate , and at a short time scale the amplitude of oscillations will slowly decay .",
    "on the contrary for the nearest neighbor phase coherence @xmath204 neither @xmath196 nor @xmath193 are bounded to the ground state and we expect that all kinds of allowed frequencies @xmath205 will give contributions .",
    "clearly in this case dephasing occurs much earlier and the amplitude of oscillations is much weaker .",
    "also the characteristic frequency of the oscillations for the nearest neighbor case will be somewhat larger than that for the global case since the level separation decreases with energy .",

    "we should expect the major oscillations at the period @xmath207 which is indeed very close to the numerical value .     for the nearest neighbor correlation ( a ) and global correlation ( b ) .",

    "but that is precisely what we need for harmonic behavior .",
    "so crudely speaking , small or intermediate interaction removes harmonics causing dephasing of the noninteracting function @xmath167 .",
    "if interactions become strong @xmath61 , then the noninteracting picture is irrelevant and we come back to the usual behavior with fast saturation of @xmath167 .",
    "notice from fig  [ fig8 ] , that the noninteracting and interacting pictures are quite different at small time .",
    "this can be also understood naturally as a result of interplay of many harmonics at early stage of the evolution .",

    "it is also straightforward to generalize the discussion of section  [ sec : twomod ] to the case of the periodic lattice .",

    "the lowest nonzero @xmath219 for the periodic boundary conditions is @xmath220 , so the critical value of the interaction , where the @xmath0 state becomes the saddle point rather than local minimum is @xmath221 similar to the two well case , the bosons undergo a spontaneous transition to the superposition of states , where all of them are in one of the wells . the time dependence of the variance of @xmath7 is analogous to that plotted on the top graph of fig  [ fig4 ] ( see fig  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "we remark that a `` slow '' or adiabatic increase of interaction must be understood carefully . in the gp picture ,",
    "an adiabatic increase of interaction means that the characteristic time scale is much smaller than the tunnelling time : @xmath222 . on the other hand , for the quantum problem adiabaticity would imply that @xmath223 is much smaller than the level spacing , which is proportional to inverse number of bosons .",
    "if the interaction is increased adiabatically in the quantum mechanical sense , then the system would follow the local minimum of the metastable state , and when @xmath11 becomes larger than the critical value , it will undergo a spontaneous transition to the dipole state ( or a superposition of the dipole states ) with broken translational symmetry .    ) .",
