    "carbon inclusion is unavoidable when growing gan layers by metal organic chemical vapor deposition ( mocvd ) technique due to several reasons : metalorganic species used as source materials , contaminants in the source gases and hydrocarbons from graphite susceptors . as a result ,",
    "un - intentional carbon doping is present in gan layers as impurities and can assume different configurations in the crystal lattice . the amount of incorporated carbon depends on the growth temperature  @xcite and pressure  @xcite . even in the case of growth performed with molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) ,",
    "gan samples are contaminated by carbon impurities as soon as they are removed from vacuum and various mitigation approaches are being developed .",
    "@xcite    on the other hand , intentional carbon doping is routinely used to obtain semi - insulating layer of gan ( gan : c ) that are critical for the fabrication of high electron mobility transistors ( hemts )  @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the presence of a significant amount of carbon in the substrate , may lead to deep level traps acting as recombination centers in the band gap , which are detrimental to the hemts performance , potentially leading to current collapse and kink effect  @xcite . therefore in order to understand the effect of carbon on the devices operation and improve their performance it is important to identify the physical origins of c - related deep level traps .",
    "earlier theoretical calculations based on density functional theory ( dft ) within local density approximation ( lda )  @xcite suggested that c could exist as substitutional forms in gan , specifically c substituting n ( @xmath3 ) and c substituting ga ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "it was also shown that @xmath3 acts as a shallow acceptor with @xmath10ev activation energy and c@xmath11 acts as a shallow donor with activation energy with @xmath12ev .",
    "it was also suggested that self - compensation by @xmath4 and @xmath3 pins the fermi level in the middle of band gap and this explains the high resistivity of gan : c layer  @xcite .",
    "another possible form of a single interstitial impurity , c@xmath13 , was predicted to show amphoteric behavior , acting as a deep acceptor in @xmath14-type gan and as a deep donor in @xmath15-type gan  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the activation energy for this acceptor level due to @xmath5 has predicted to be @xmath16ev .    from the experimental standpoint , a significant number of studies to understand the trap levels , specifically the energy states in the band - gap , in carbon doped gan",
    "have been performed using a variety of techniques . among these ,",
    "photoionization spectroscopy ( ps )  @xcite , deep level transient spectroscopy ( dlts ) , including minority carrier transient spectroscopy ( mcts ) and photoinduced current transient spectroscopy ( picts )  @xcite , deep level optical spectroscopy ( dlos )  @xcite and cathodoluminescence ( cl ) measurement  @xcite .",
    "dlts , mcts and picts have been primarily employed to detect trap levels close to the band edges ( within @xmath171.0ev ) .",
    "techniques based on optical methods such as dlos are used mainly to detect deeper trap levels , in an energy range close to the center of the band gap .",
    "combinations of different types of techniques makes it possible to cover entire band gap region and potentially detect all existing trap levels .    using ps technique , klein _",
    "_  showed that one of two kinds of deep traps ( with absorption threshold at 2.85ev ) , which is responsible for the current collapse of algan / gan hemt , has a carbon origin because its concentration tracks the carbon doping level  @xcite .",
    "et al . _  using dlos measurement which is able to determine that a trap level located 1.35ev below the conduction band minimum ( cbm , @xmath18 ) was related to carbon  @xcite .",
    "_  investigated the origin of a number of deep level traps in gan using a combination of dlts , dlos and steady - state photocapacitance ( sspc ) techniques  @xcite .",
    "two of the energy levels obtained by dlts were ascribed to carbon .",
    "one was located 0.11ev below the cbm , and its origin was assigned to @xmath4 , based on previous lda calculated results .",
    "the other trap level appeared at @xmath19ev , where @xmath20 is the energy of the valence band maximum ( vbm ) , but its physical origin was unknown .",
    "in addition , four more levels that were obtained by the combination of dlos and sspc were ascribed to carbon .",
    "based on existing lda result  @xcite , a trap energy level at @xmath21ev was assigned to an acceptor state of interstitial carbon ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "two traps at @xmath22ev and @xmath23ev were c - related , but their physical forms remained unknown .",
    "a trap at @xmath24ev was assigned to an acceptor level of @xmath3 , once again , based on lda result  @xcite .",
    "shah and coworkers performed dlts and mcts measurements  @xcite and inferred that an energy level at @xmath25ev was possibly related to @xmath4 and behaved as an electron trap state .",
    "furthermore , two energy levels responsible for trapping holes were observed and were also related to c. one was at @xmath26ev with @xmath3 assignment and the other at @xmath27ev with @xmath3-related defects or gallium vacancy .",
    "et al . _  studied deep levels by photocurrent spectra measurements and picts . with the former method three c - related trap levels with optical threshold",
    "near 1.31.4ev , 2.72.8ev and 3ev were observed .",
    "the first was attributed to @xmath5 acceptor state , whereas the other two were left unassigned . more recent experimental result , carried out by honda _",
    "_  using mcts measurements , indicated that a hole trapping state may be present at @xmath28ev and was assigned to @xmath3 based on recent dft calculation employing hybrid functionals  @xcite .",
    "they also concluded that one electron trap at @xmath29ev was associated with c , but did not specify its physical form .",
    "from the theoretical standpoint , the majority of studies performed to understand the nature of carbon in gan have been carried out using dft within the lda approximation .",
    "@xcite only recently , a small number of investigations  @xcite have employed more sophisticated dft approaches based on hybrid functionals , with the intent to overcome the limitations of lda , and obtain a more reliable energetics for the various carbon configurations in gan . among these recent studies ,",
    "dft calculations using heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof ( hse ) hybrid density functionals for single carbon impurities , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , were reported  @xcite . unlike in previous lda results , these calculations indicates that @xmath3 may not be a shallow but a deep acceptor with @xmath30ev activation energy , which means that c can not be used as a @xmath15-type donor in gan .",
    "furthermore , recent hse - based calculations , indicates that the acceptor level of @xmath5 is @xmath31ev as opposed to the values of @xmath32ev obtained using lda .  @xcite .",
    "these new outcomes , suggest that the assignments of experimentally observed trap levels based on earlier lda results should be re - examined using more reliable approaches , such as hse hybrid density functionals , that could provide a more accurate picture of the system energetics .",
    "the aim of this work is twofold , first , we intend to perform a comprehensive study of the formation energies of single carbon impurity and complexes in gan using state - of - the - art dft and hse hybrid density functionals .",
    "specifically we intend to focus on the role of complexes about which very little is known .",
    "second , we intend to perform a systematic comparison of the numerical results with the available experimental data with two specific goals in mind : establish which energy level can be reliably assigned to a given configuration , and for which energy level additional experimental and theoretical work is needed .",
    "we want to emphasize this last issue , since there are several experimentally observed c - related energy levels , whose physical forms are still unknown .",
    "this manuscript focuses on the complexes that carbon forms with ga , n and their vacancies .",
    "furthermore , this work is a companion to a second manuscript@xcite in which we present the investigation of complexes that carbon forms in gan with silicon , oxygen and hydrogen and we discuss their relative concentrations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ s : methods ] , the details of the computational model are presented and the theoretical formulations of the formation energies and transition levels are provided . furthermore we describe what kind of convergence studies have been performed to determine the supercell size to be used in the case of charged defects and complexes . in section",
    "[ s : results ] , we will outline our calculated results that will be discussed in section  [ s : discussion ] . finally concluding remarks are given in section  [ s : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section the computational approach is outlined .",
    "first the computational framework is presented .",
    "subsequently the model used to evaluate the formation energy is given , and finally the effect of the supercell size on formation energy is discussed .",
    "the calculations presented in this work were carried out using the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method  @xcite implemented in the vasp code  @xcite .",
    "the main results were obtained using heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof ( hse ) hybrid functionals  @xcite .",
    "additionally , convergence tests were also performed using standard perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite functionals .",
    "the semicore ga @xmath33 electrons were included as valence , since treating ga @xmath33 electrons as core caused relatively large errors ( @xmath34ev ) in the formation energies for carbon complexes .",
    "furthermore , in the case of hse , in order to reproduce experimental band gap value ( 3.5ev  @xcite ) , the amount of exact exchange was taken to be 28% ( giving 3.45ev band gap value ) .",
    "finally , a 425ev cutoff energy was used . during the structural optimization procedure to obtain the total energy of different configurations , the atomic positions were allowed to change until the largest force component was less than 0.05ev /  .",
    "the bulk parameters obtained from fully optimized unit cell are summarized in table  [ tab : bulkpara ] . using these optimized lattice constants ,",
    "a supercell containing total 96 atoms with orthorhombic shape was constructed and employed to study the carbon inclusions .",
    "the brillouin zone is sampled on a mesh composed of a @xmath35 @xmath36-point grid .",
    "convergence tests in pbe showed that the differences in formation energies between @xmath35 mesh and denser @xmath37 mesh were less than 50mev .",
    "the same tests were also done in hse , where @xmath35 mesh and @xmath38 mesh were compared .",
    "the differences in formation energies were less than 0.1ev . in fig .",
    "[ f : kconv ] , the formation energies ( its definition will be provided in the next section ) for @xmath6 in ga - rich condition are presented for different @xmath36-point mesh both in pbe and hse to show the convergence .",
    "convergence tests performed to evaluate the dependence of the calculated values on the supercell size will be discussed in section[s : supcell ] .",
    ".calculated values for lattice constants , energy gap , formation enthalpy and static dielectric constant .",
    "experimental results are also given.[tab : bulkpara ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we consider first the trap level located at @xmath39ev obtained by armstrong _",
    "_  and that was also observed by polyakov__et al . _ _  as well as by honda__et al.__. while armstrong__et al . _ _  and polyakov__et al . _",
    "_  did not give a clear assignment to this trap level , honda__et al . _ _",
    "@xcite assigned it to @xmath3 ( 0/@xmath40 ) by comparing the experimental value to the calculated result obtained using hse by lyons__et al . _ _",
    "indeed our calculated results support this assignment . in our case ,",
    "the @xmath3 ( 0/@xmath40 ) level is located at 0.89ev above valence band maximum with 2.91ev optical activation energy ( @xmath41 ) as shown in table  [ t : calcth1 ] .",
    "furthermore , the thermal activation energy of this trap is calculated to be @xmath42=2.56ev .",
    "consequently we argue that the trap level at @xmath43ev , originally measured by shah__et al . _ _",
    "@xcite and that was considered to be related to @xmath3 complex or gallium vacancy , is in reality due to @xmath3 ( 0/@xmath40 ) .",
    "we turn our attention to the trap levels originally assigned to @xmath3 ( 0/@xmath40 ) , specifically the one located at @xmath44ev measured by armstrong__et al . _ _  and @xmath45ev level by shah _",
    "et al._. since shah__et al .",
    "_ _  measured this energy with mcts we assume that this is a thermal activation energy . from tables  [ t : calcth1 ] and  [ t : calcth2 ] we can observe that the energies corresponding to ( + /0 ) of @xmath3 gives the value of 3.20ev . on the other hand ,",
    "we notice that the trap level observed by armstrong__et al . _ _  with dlos should be treated as an optical activation energy . in this case",
    "we observe that the ( 4+/3 + ) of @xmath5 ( 3.11ev ) as well as ( + /0 ) of @xmath8 ( 3.21ev ) are calculated optical trap levels , which have the energy very close to experimental one ( 3.28ev ) .",
    "the next one is the trap level at @xmath46ev observed by armstrong__et al .",
    "_ _  and polyakov__et al .",
    "_ _  that was assigned to @xmath5 ( 0/@xmath47 ) based on a 1.13ev thermal activation energy computed by lda  @xcite .",
    "first we point out that , based on our hse calculation , the ( 0/@xmath47 ) state is energetically unfavorable while the ( 0/@xmath40 ) , that was found to be unfavorable with lda is now possible . for this ( 0/@xmath40 ) state we compute an optical activation energy of 0.82ev that corresponds to a thermal activation energy of 0.25ev",
    ". consequently , @xmath5 ( 0/@xmath40 ) can not be the origin of the level @xmath48ev observed by armstrong__et al.__. additionally , we notice that the calculated ( + /0 ) @xmath5 level from hse results in a optical activation energy of 1.58ev , corresponding to a thermal activation energy of 0.87ev . therefore based on our results , the origin of @xmath46ev level",
    "is not likely to be related to any of the @xmath5 states .",
    "finally , based on hse the ( 0/@xmath40 ) state of the @xmath49 complex has a 1.31ev optical activation energy . as a result , this is likely to be the origin of the experimentally observed @xmath46ev level .",
    "note that the ( @xmath47/@xmath50 ) state of the @xmath51 complex has @xmath52ev , but this complex is unstable in this energy region with negative binding energy .",
    "_  observed , using dlts , a @xmath53ev level and concluded that it was c - related , but did not mention its origin .",
    "based on our calculations the ( 0/@xmath40 ) level of @xmath5 has a 0.25ev thermal activation energy .",
    "furthermore , the theoretical values of the activation energy for the ( + /0 ) level of @xmath9 is 0.22ev .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the origin of the @xmath53ev level is the ( 0/@xmath40 ) state of @xmath5 and/or the ( + /0 ) state of @xmath9 .    the @xmath54ev level observed with dlos by armstrong _",
    "et al . _",
    "was assumed to be c - related but its physical form remained unknown . from our calculated results",
    "two levels have similar optical activation energies .",
    "one is ( 2+/+ ) level of @xmath49 with 1.96ev and the other is ( 0/@xmath40 ) level of @xmath8 with 2.08ev .",
    "these two states are the likely candidates to explain the physical origin of the @xmath55ev trap level .",
    "polyakov _ et al . _  observed a optical threshold at 2.72.8ev by photocurrent spectra measurement .",
    "the origin of this trap level is likely to be the ( 2+/+ ) level of @xmath5 , whose optical activation energy is computed to be 2.87ev .",
    "the last two energy levels we consider are the one located at @xmath56ev measured by armstrong__et al . _",
    "_  and at @xmath57ev measured by shah__et al.__. these two levels were assigned to @xmath4 based on lda results  @xcite , for which the ( + /0 ) transition level was computed to be about 0.2ev below cbm .",
    "however , our hse calculation shows that such ( + /0 ) level of @xmath4 does not appear within the band gap , but it is in the conduction band approximately 0.5ev above cbm .",
    "recent hse calculation by lyons__et al . _ _",
    "@xcite does not show such level within the band gap either .",
    "from our results we evince that the ( + /0 ) level of @xmath58 complex has a 0.24ev thermal activation energy .",
    "unfortunately this complex is unlikely to form when the fermi energy is around this value because its biding energy is barely positive as we can see from fig .",
    "[ f : eb ] . based on our calculations ,",
    "the most likely candidate is the ( + /0 ) state of @xmath9 located at 0.22ev below the cbm and/or the ( 0/@xmath40 ) state of @xmath5 at 0.25ev below the cbm .",
    "therefore , it is probable that these levels have the same origin of the @xmath59ev level observed by honda",
    "we have performed first - principles calculations using hse hybrid density functional in the framework of dft to investigate the characteristics of various forms of carbon inclusions in gan .",
    "we have considered single impurities , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , as well as their complexes @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . for all these configurations , different charge states have been considered and their geometries are fully optimized .",
    "formation and binding energies of complexes have been computed and thermodynamic transition levels are obtained .    among single impurities , @xmath3 behaves mainly as a deep acceptor , @xmath4 acts as a donor without inducing states in the band gap and @xmath5 shows amphoteric behavior .",
    "both in n - rich and ga - rich conditions the 4 + charge state of @xmath5 , which assumes an octahedral interstitial position , is favorable close to the vbm ( @xmath15-type region ) .",
    "the @xmath60 charge state of @xmath3 is favorable close to the cbm ( @xmath14-type region ) , and @xmath4 is also favorable in @xmath15-type region but only in n - rich conditions",
    ".    complexes made of combinations of single impurities , specifically @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , have also been considered .",
    "@xmath0 is favorable in the upper half of the band gap ( @xmath14-type ) region , whereas @xmath1 and @xmath2 are favorable in the lower half of the band gap ( @xmath15-type ) region .",
    "finally , complexes with vacancies are also examined , in particular @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the former is favorable with lower formation energy comparing to the latter close the cbm , but is unstable as a complex in the @xmath14-type region with negative value of binding energy .",
    "the latter is favorable in the @xmath15-type region comparing to the former .    from the calculated formation energies we have evaluated the thermodynamic transition levels .",
    "these are directly related to the thermal activation energies observed in experimental techniques such as dlts .",
    "in addition , by calculating franck - condon shift , optical activation energies , which can be obtained by optical techniques such as dlos , have been evaluated from the thermal activation energies .",
    "we compare our calculated values of activation energies with the energies of experimentally observed c - related trap levels .",
    "the trap level observed at @xmath61ev is likely due to the ( 0/@xmath40 ) level of @xmath3 .",
    "based on earlier investigations performed employing lda , to different energy levels : @xmath62 ev level by mcts ( thermal method ) and @xmath63ev by dlos ( optical method ) , were attributed to the ( 0/@xmath40 ) level of @xmath3 .",
    "however , our hse calculation shows that the origin of the @xmath62ev level is the ( + /0 ) level of @xmath3 and of the level at @xmath63ev is the ( 4+/3 + ) of @xmath5 and/or the ( + /0 ) of @xmath8 .    based on lda results , the trap level observed at @xmath46ev",
    "was unanimously attributed to the ( 0/2@xmath40 ) state of @xmath5 .",
    "however , the outcome of our hse calculation suggests its origin is the ( 0/@xmath40 ) state of the @xmath2 complex .",
    "the trap at @xmath64ev is likely due to two configurations .",
    "one is the ( 2+/+ ) of @xmath2 and the other is the ( 0/@xmath40 ) of @xmath8 .",
    "looking at the trap level located at @xmath65ev we argue that its origin stems from the ( 2+/+ ) state of the @xmath5 .",
    "multiple contributors are likely to be responsible for the trap at @xmath66ev . specifically we find that the ( 0/@xmath40 ) of @xmath5 and the ( + /0 ) of @xmath9 have energies that are close to the measured value . finally , the trap at @xmath67ev was attributed to @xmath4 based on lda results . however , based on our hse calculations , there are no gap states due to @xmath4",
    ". therefore the origin of this trap level is still unclear , but the most likely candidate is the ( + /0 ) of @xmath9 and/or the ( 0/@xmath40 ) of @xmath5 . in this case",
    "these levels have same origin as @xmath68ev level .",
