    "an extensive experimental effort on mode - i ( tensile ) fracture in amorphous materials has been made in the last two decades  @xcite ( for a review , see  @xcite ) . in the high crack velocity regime ,",
    "the simple picture of a rapid steady - state crack generated via a given driving displacement , and exhibiting a given crack velocity ( of order the rayleigh surface wave speed ) breaks down , and small micro - branches start to appear next to the main crack  @xcite .",
    "upon further increase of the loading , the microscopic branches transform to large macro - branches .",
    "the experimental phenomena of the appearance of micro - branches has been the subject of an extensive theoretical effort as well .",
    "there have been several attempts within the framework of continuum models , based on the linear elasticity fracture mechanics ( lefm ) theory  @xcite .",
    "yoffe predicted that steady - state cracks will become unstable at a specific crack velocity @xmath1 , based on maximal stress considerations  @xcite .",
    "another _ ad hoc _ attempt based on energy considerations predicted a critical velocity of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "however , the mode - i experiments have shown that the critical velocity is material - dependent , refuting those lefm predictions .",
    "several lefm - based works predict a micro - branching instability at a material - dependent critical velocity  @xcite , however , the specific parameter that determines the specific critical velocity , @xmath3 is an input parameter to the theory .",
    "additional efforts have been made to explore the micro - branching phenomena based on lefm  @xcite .",
    "however , as these works themselves argue , although they recover some features of the micro - branching instability , some main predictions such as that the energy flow to the micro - branches drops immediately , are unphysical ( the micro - branch arrests immediately ) .",
    "these results raise the possibility that the micro - branches phenomena is a 3d - phenomena , while in 2d the high - velocity instability occurs only for extreme crack velocities ( @xmath4 ) , as the crack oscillates .",
    "this argument is based on experiments , both in biaxial mode - i crack in rubber  @xcite , and pure mode - i experiments in gels  @xcite , and associated theoretical works  @xcite .",
    "however the mode - i experiments in pmma seem to indicate that beyond a certain crack velocity , the crack structure that emerges is essentially two - dimensional  @xcite . there has been some success in exploring the instability using phenomenological mesoscale approaches based on the phase - field  @xcite or on cohesive zones  @xcite ; these however are difficult to quantitatively relate to an underlying microscopic picture .",
    "the failure of the continuum theory ( lefm ) has given rise to an extensive theoretical effort using atomistic lattice models  @xcite and lattice simulations  @xcite , where the inherent divergence of the elastic fields near the crack tip of the continuum theories is tamed , due to the finite atomistic lattice scale .",
    "these models yield steady state cracks without any additional parameters , once the inter - atomic forces are specified . both lattice models and simulations",
    "have shown and reproduced the sharp transition between steady states cracks , where only the bonds on the midline of the lattice are broken , and the post - instability behavior , where beyond some critical velocity , other bonds start to fail . this critical velocity was found to have a strong dependence ( @xmath5 ) on the parameters of the potential , i.e. it is _",
    "material dependent_. although the lattice models yield the desired existence of a critical velocity , regarding the post - instability point behavior , the success is less impressive .",
    "mode - iii ( out - of - plane shear mode ) simulations have shown nice qualitative patterns of micro - branches  @xcite , similar mode - i simulations ( the mode for which most of the experiments actually have been performed ) , have failed to reproduce the qualitative patterns of micro - branches emerging near the main crack  @xcite .",
    "thus , several attempts have been made to try to simulate cracks in _ amorphous materials _ , in which the bulk of experiments have been performed ( e.g. , glass , pmma , homalite-100 etc . ) .",
    "the first attempts used the classic binary - alloy model ( using two different kinds of particles )  @xcite simulating an amorphous material failed  @xcite ; the crack always arrested .",
    "recently  @xcite , a new approach were presented based on a continuous random network model ( crn ) for simulating amorphous materials  @xcite . in this model",
    "the sample looks like a distorted lattice , while each atom shares the same number of nearest neighbor atoms .",
    "the crn model yields both steady - state cracks and the main features of the micro - branching instability , including the increasing size of the micro - branches and the increasing oscillations in the electrical resistance of the sample  @xcite with increasing external loading .",
    "recently  @xcite , dauchot , et al . succeeded in generating propagating steady - state cracks using the binary - alloy model , by going to the extreme brittle limit , where the force falls rapidly to zero for very small strains .",
    "however , no information was reported regarding the high - velocity instability . moreover , the @xmath0 ( rdf ) generated from the amorphous model presented in  @xcite are much less similar to the @xmath0 s of real amorphous materials than those the crn s model generates .    in this work",
    "we focus on trying to reproduce the successful results of the crn model also in lattices ( where the previous attempts have failed , as explained above ) .",
    "to do so , we let the force - law between the atoms vary slightly by changing randomly the lattice scale @xmath6 between the atoms . as a result",
    ", the equilibrium locations of the atoms are slightly changed from their pure lattice locations , according to the modified force law . by breaking the pure symmetry of the perfect lattice",
    ", we hope to obtain a realistic micro - branching phenomena in these simple structures .",
    "the semi - quantitative behaviors of the micro - branches , such as the length of the micro - branches , should be less noisy than the corresponding results for crn s .",
    "in our model , each bond ( between atoms @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) has a specific characteristic equilibrium distance at which the force is zero .",
    "this distance @xmath9 is taken to vary slightly from the constant distance @xmath10 by a factor of @xmath11 which is drawn from a uniform distribution : @xmath12 where @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath14 is a _ constant _ for a given lattice and in this work ranges between @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 refers to the nearest - neighbors of site @xmath7 .    between each two atoms",
    "there is a piece - wise linear radial force ( 2-body force law ) of the form : @xmath18 where the heaviside step function @xmath19 guarantees that the force drops immediately to zero when the distance between two atoms @xmath20 reaches a certain value @xmath21 ( the break of a bond ) . in this work",
    "we set @xmath22 , and the units are chosen so that the spring constant @xmath23 is unity .",
    "potentially , in addition there is a 3-body force law that depends on the cosine of each of the angles , defined of course by : @xmath24 in a honeycomb lattice there are three angles associated with each atom and in the hexagonal lattice there are six of them ( we note that in the hexagonal lattice this choice is a little bit arbitrary since there are in general additional optional angles for each atom ) .",
    "there is a certain preferred angle @xmath25 for which the 3-body force law vanishes ( in the honeycomb lattice we set @xmath26 and in the hexagonal lattice we set @xmath27 ) .",
    "the 3-body force law that acts on the central atom ( atom @xmath7 ) of each angle may expressed as : @xmath28\\theta_h\\left(\\varepsilon-\\vert\\vec{r}_{i , j}\\vert\\right ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the force that is applied on the other two atoms ( atoms @xmath29 ) may expressed as : @xmath30\\theta_h\\left(\\varepsilon-\\vert\\vec{r}_{i , j}\\vert\\right ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of course , the forces satisfy the relation : @xmath31 .",
    "in addition , we used a kelvin - type viscoelastic force , proportional to the relative velocity between the two atoms of the bond @xmath32 : @xmath33 with @xmath34 the viscosity parameter .",
    "the viscous force vanishes after the bond is broken .",
    "thus , the equation of motion of each atom is : @xmath35 where @xmath36 for the honeycomb lattice and @xmath37 for the hexagonal lattice ( @xmath38=nearest neighbors ) .",
    "the masses @xmath39 can also be set to unity without loss of generality .",
    "the main methodology is as follows : after choosing the random value @xmath9 for each bond , we allow the network to relax through a simple molecular - dynamics euler scheme , in accord with eqs .",
    "( [ motion_equations ] ) , with a non - zero @xmath34 , until the total energy is minimized . in fig .",
    "[ reshet ] , we can see an example of a perturbed honeycomb lattice with @xmath40 , while in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we can see the distribution of the radial distances of the bonds for a perturbed lattice with @xmath41 , @xmath40 along with the crn , taken from  @xcite .",
    "we can see the qualitative difference between the perturbed lattice mesh and the crn .",
    "while the radial distributions for the perturbed lattice mesh are flat in the range of @xmath42 and then drops immediately to zero ( since the random distribution was taken to be flat in the range of @xmath42 ) , the crn has a long tails extending over larger distances .",
    "in addition , the angular distributions are much narrower than the crn s angular distribution .    a powerful tool to check the character of the grid is of course the radial distribution function ( rdf or @xmath0 ) . in fig . [ fig2 ]",
    "we can see the rdfs of the perturbed lattices and the crn .",
    "we can see again the qualitative difference between the meshes . while the crn looks very much like a real amorphous material ( see  @xcite ) ,",
    "the rdfs of the perturbed lattices look exactly like a pure lattice rdf ( set of @xmath43-functions ) , only slightly perturbed due to the random noise , even for large @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the structure of the perturbed lattices is like a lattice material rather than an amorphous material .    after characterizing the initial lattices",
    ", we stretch the lattice under a mode - i tensile loading with a given constant strain using a given driving displacement @xmath45 , and seed the system with an initial crack .",
    "we let the crack propagate via the same molecular dynamics euler scheme that was introduced before .",
    "the lattice mesh we use contains @xmath46 ( @xmath47 in the slepyan model notation ) atoms for the honeycomb lattice and @xmath48 atoms for the hexagonal lattice .",
    "using @xmath49 , i.e. an unperturbed honeycomb lattice , we obtain the well - known non - physical behavior of the crack above threshold . for small strains",
    "we get a perfect steady - state crack , while upon increasing the driving displacement , the crack bifurcates to two macro - branches that propagate to the edges of the sample  @xcite .",
    "the same happens in the honeycomb lattice including the 3-body force law , both with large - viscosity and with a negligible viscosity ( fig .",
    "[ pure_lattice_crack ] ) .    using a finite value of @xmath14 to perturb the lattice ,",
    "we obtain nice snapshots of micro - branches , very much like those obtained using the crn  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ beehive_crack1](a ) we can see that when the driving displacement exceeds some value , a large micro - branch starts to appear . in fig .",
    "[ beehive_crack2 ] we can see the final pattern of broken bonds for two cases , one for @xmath50 ( fig . [",
    "beehive_crack2](a ) ) and one for @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "[ beehive_crack2](b ) ) .",
    "the patterns looks very much like the fracture pattern seen using the crn .",
    "moreover , the micro - branches also look similar to the experimental images of micro - branches in pmma  @xcite .",
    "this is an important result . as far as we know , this is the first time that such a micro - branch pattern has appeared in a _ lattice _ material ( previously shown by us only using an amorphous material model  @xcite ) .",
    "we note that when the main crack continues and the micro - branch arrests , one piece of the lattice overlaps with another piece ( see fig .",
    "[ beehive_crack1](b ) ) .",
    "this is a non - physical effect and is caused from the fact that cracking in this model is irreversible .",
    "this effect is not large using the honeycomb lattice , but will be much more pronounced for the hexagonal lattice .    beyond obtaining the qualitative features of the micro - branches ,",
    "the perturbed lattice model reproduces the main semi - quantitative results of mode - i fracture beyond the onset of instability . because of the chaotic nature of the problem ( small changes in the simulation parameters yield different crack patterns , but with similar quantitative properties , such as the crack velocity ) , we changed the time - step by a little bit ( @xmath52 ) for each driving displacement @xmath45 , to have sufficiently good statistics on the resulting parameters ( about 20 runs for each point , therefore each point in fig .",
    "[ beehive_results](a - c ) represents a set of @xmath53 runs ) . in fig .",
    "[ beehive_results ] we can see the @xmath54 curve ( a ) , the total length of the micro - branches ( b ) and the amplitude of the oscillations of the electrical resistance ( c ) .",
    "the @xmath54 curve looks very much like the typical @xmath54 curve for mode - i fracture ( for example , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the error bars represent the statistical error of the crack s velocity using several simulations for each @xmath45 .",
    "the graph of the total length of the micro - branches as a function of the crack s velocity is one of the most important results of this work .",
    "we can easily see that the total length of micro - branches goes to zero at small velocities , with a clear growth ( near @xmath55 ) with increasing velocity ( or @xmath45 ) .",
    "this is in direct accord with the to experiment results ( but instead of a sharp transition between steady - state cracks area and micro - branches area , we get a smooth transition , due to the noisy character of discrete atomistic simulation at smaller scales ) .",
    "actually , the experimental results refer as the length of an average single micro - branch , but because the lack of statistics ( we have only a few micro - branches in each single simulation , so it is hard to define the length of an average single micro - branch ) , we use the total sum of broken bonds instead ( besides of course the main crack ) .",
    "this should be a sufficiently close substitute ( we see that we _ do not _ have just more  short \" micro - branches at large drivings ; the size of each micro - branch indeed grows ) .",
    "comparing to the corresponding result using the crn for amorphous material  @xcite ( see also the triangles in fig .",
    "[ beehive_results2](b ) ) , where this transition was less pronounced , here it is much more clear .",
    "we note that by defining the total size of the micro - branches we subtracted all the  micro - branches \" of size 1 or 2 broken bonds , which we neglect and treat as numerical noise .    from fig .",
    "[ beehive_results](b ) we can see that using @xmath56 yields a too noisy system and we get either arrested cracks or significant micro - branches .",
    "there is no intermediate zone of steady - state cracks . only using @xmath50",
    "do we yield clear steady - state cracks . increasing @xmath34 further more to @xmath51 does not change the results appreciably .",
    "in addition , the amplitude of the oscillations of the electrical resistance shows a nice agreement with the experimental result , as well as the crn results  @xcite ( for a wide discussion in the different terminology between the crack s velocity oscillation and the electrical resistance oscillations and the appropriateness of the  electrical resistance \" oscillations as a diagnostic , see  @xcite ) . beyond the  critical velocity \" the amplitude of the oscillations increases rapidly , while for small velocity",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations is constant .",
    "the sensitivity to the value of @xmath14 , characterizing the width of the bond length distribution , was also investigated , exploring how much we can reduce @xmath14 and still get a physical behavior of micro - branches pattern , recalling that @xmath49 ( pure lattice ) _ does not _ create a physically realistic pattern . for @xmath57 ,",
    "we reproduce the non - physical perfect lattice behavior , i.e. the perfect lattice behavior is not a singular case , in the sense that infinitesimal change in the lattice produce micro - branches .",
    "you need a significant perturbation to yield physical behavior .",
    "in fact , even for @xmath41 , the micro - branches seems to be in an almost straight lines , along the preferred lattice directions , and thus , less physical . in fig .",
    "[ beehive_results2 ] we can see the quantitative results using different values of @xmath14 , along with the crn results ( taken from  @xcite ) .    from the @xmath54 curve ( fig .",
    "[ beehive_results2](a ) ) and the amplitude of the oscillations ( fig .",
    "[ beehive_results2](c ) ) we can see that the crn is closer to the @xmath40 results . in fig .",
    "[ beehive_results2](b ) we see that low @xmath14 results look like the crn result .",
    "this fact encourages us to conclude that the transition of the crn results between low velocities and high is real , since increasing @xmath14 we get the same effect , but with a much sharper transition .",
    "the classic models concerning molecular dynamics fracture simulations in perfect lattices used a hexagonal lattice  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , those models were able to show nice qualitative results in the mode - iii fracture simulations  @xcite , but failed to create the physical pattern of micro - branches in mode - i fracture simulations , investigated in the experiments  @xcite .",
    "the new findings from the previous section , that a small perturbation in the potential between each two atoms _ can _ create a physical pattern of mode - i fracture , suggest it is worthwhile to try it also in the classic hexagonal lattice .",
    "the resulting radial and angular distributions for several parameters are shown in fig .",
    "[ hex_dist ] .    using the same magnitude of perturbation as in the honeycomb lattice , @xmath40 ( with no 3-body force law , i.e. @xmath58 )",
    "yields an extreme noisy simulations , and eventually , in most cases , the crack arrests . using a smaller value of @xmath14 ( @xmath41 ) , yields in general micro - branching patterns ( for large driving displacement ) ( figs .",
    "[ hex_crack1 ] and [ hex_crack2 ] ) , but it still looks less physical than the honeycomb lattice results . at low drivings , there is a single steady - state crack propagating in the midline of the sample yielding no broken bonds besides the main crack .",
    "nevertheless , the benefit of using this model ( in the absence of a 3-body force law ) is that we can compare it to slepyan s lattice steady - state models ( like in  @xcite , using large @xmath59 , which corresponds to a piecewise - linear model ) , when the origin of instability between steady - state cracks and micro - branches behavior is known exactly ( although the models use @xmath49 , the small perturbation does not change the results significantly ) .",
    "using @xmath14 smaller than @xmath60 reproduces the non - physical behavior of perfect lattices .",
    "in addition , the hexagonal mesh allows us to work with small values of @xmath34 which is more relevant experimentally  @xcite , than the large @xmath34 honeycomb lattice .    in fig .",
    "[ hex_crack1](a ) we can see the a birth of a micro - branch that bifurcates from the main crack , that eventually arrests .",
    "the pattern looks very much alike the honeycomb lattice . in fig .",
    "[ hex_crack2 ] we can see the final pattern of broken bonds for the case of @xmath61 .",
    "the quantitative results regarding the @xmath54 curve and the total size of micro - branches as a function of @xmath62 are presented in fig .",
    "[ hex_results ] .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ hex_results](a ) that the velocities below @xmath63 reproduce the slepyan s lattice model results from  @xcite , yielding perfect steady - state cracks , with no micro - branches at all ( fig .",
    "[ hex_results](b ) ) .",
    "increasing the driving displacement @xmath45 further , yields a non steady - state behavior , as the steady - state lattice model solution becomes unstable , yielding a micro - branching behavior ( again , only above a threshold @xmath14 ) .",
    "we note again that in many cases the fracture pattern do not looks as physical as in fig .",
    "[ hex_crack2 ] , yielding some non - physical results .",
    "in addition , the problem of overlapping zones is more extensive in the hexagonal lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ hex_crack1](b ) ) , yielding large areas of overlapping zones and thus , yielding an unphysical behavior .",
    "the main benefit so far of using this model is that fig .",
    "[ hex_results](b ) yields similar qualitative results to fig .",
    "[ beehive_results](b ) or fig .",
    "[ beehive_results2](b ) , emphasizing that the transition at low velocities to a steady - state behavior is real , since in a hexagonal case we get absolutely zero micro - branches at low - velocities , and agreement with the slepyan s lattice models .    adding a 3-body force law in a hexagonal lattice",
    ", one must use large values of @xmath64 since the relatively large number of nearest neighbors does nt allow each 3 atoms to generate an angle significantly larger than @xmath65 using @xmath66 ( as was the case in the honeycomb lattice ) , and thus , the 3-body energy is negligible .",
    "when we increase @xmath64 using @xmath41 , we yield a perfect lattice behavior because @xmath64 is too large . increasing @xmath14",
    "further to @xmath40 yields a good balance which the 3-body energy is not negligible and yields similar radial and angular distributions as a hexagonal lattice without the 3-body force law using @xmath41 ( see fig . [ hex_dist ] ) .",
    "we normalize the @xmath54 curve results and the total size of micro - branches as a function of @xmath62 using this model to the values of the non-3-body force law case ( the normalization constants @xmath67 and @xmath68 are of course larger using large significant @xmath64 ) and present them in fig .",
    "[ hex_results ] .",
    "we can see that these two models share the same qualitative behavior ( although the including 3-body force law results yields a small number of micro - branches at low velocities , very much like the honeycomb case ) .",
    "in addition , this model still suffers from a severe problem of overlapping of pieces of the mesh after branching ( in contrast to honeycomb lattice , which in this model , this problem is minor ) .",
    "however , two surprising results appear using this model ( a perturbed hexagonal lattice _ including _ 3-body force law ) .",
    "first , the main crack stays more confined to the middle of the sample , even for large driving , with large micro - branches , in contrast to all other models , including the honeycomb lattice model .",
    "second , and most important , the larger micro - branches have a non - linear , power law shape ( ! ) very much alike the experimental data . in fig . [ micro_power ]",
    "we can see several of crack - patterns for different driving displacements ( with different @xmath69 , with shifting in the @xmath70-axis , of course ) . we add a basic power law fit ( with different @xmath71 and @xmath72 for each large micro - branch , of course ) .",
    "we got a nice power law behavior ( but with power of @xmath73 instead of @xmath74 of  @xcite ) .",
    "this is of course a very preliminary result , and must be tested in larger scales .",
    "we note that the @xmath74 power law behavior is not universal for all the experiments . at least in the experiments of  @xcite ( fig .",
    "3 ) ,  @xcite ( fig .",
    "4(a ) ) and  @xcite ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) , straight micro - branches appear , so the physical behavior of figs . [ beehive_crack2 ] and [ hex_crack2 ]",
    "is important too . on the other hand , power law behavior ( different than 1 )",
    "is seen in the atomistic model only in a perturbed hexagonal lattice _ including",
    "_ 3-body force law .",
    "these observations support the conclusion that the macroscopic behavior of fracture depends strongly on the inter - atomic microscopic potential .",
    "we have shown that micro - branching can be reproduced in lattice materials , using a small perturbation parameter @xmath14 which perturbs the inter - atomic potential between each two atoms .",
    "in addition to the qualitative patterns of micro - branches , semi quantitative results are shown , particular the total size of micro - branches ( which corresponds to the average size of a micro - branch in the experiments ) as a function of the velocity . a clear transition between steady - state behavior and the post - instability region",
    "is seen , characterized by an increased number of broken bond off the midline of the sample .",
    "this result is in line with the results of the crn model .",
    "in particular we obtain in the hexagonal case ( without 3-body force law ) no micro - branching at all , as in the slepyan lattice models .",
    "the increased amplitude of the rms of the electrical resistance is shown as well , in agreement to the experiments .",
    "in addition , preliminary signs of power law behavior for the shape of the side branches can be seen using a hexagonal lattice including a 3-body force law , in accord with experiment , and which has not been observed in previous atomistic models .",
    "much more extensive work is underway to extend this result to larger scales , as well as exploring the opening angle of the crack .",

    "<S> we study mode - i fracture in lattices with noisy bonds . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous attempts , by using a small parameter that perturbs the force - law between the atoms in perfect lattices and using a 3-body force law , simulations reproduce the qualitative behavior of the beyond steady - state cracks in the high velocity regime , including reasonable micro - branching . as far as the physical properties such as the structure factor @xmath0 , the radial or angular distributions , these lattices share the physical properties of perfect lattices rather than that of an amorphous material ( e.g. , the continuous random network model ) . </S>",
    "<S> a clear transition can be seen between steady - state cracks , where a single crack propagates in the midline of the sample and the regime of unstable cracks , where micro - branches start to appear near the main crack , in line with previous experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> this is seen both in a honeycomb lattice and a fully hexagonal lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this model reproduces the main physical features of propagating cracks in brittle materials , including the behavior of velocity as a function of driving displacement and the increasing amplitude of oscillations of the electrical resistance . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , preliminary indications of power - law behavior of the micro - branch shapes can be seen , potentially reproducing one of the most intriguing experimental results of brittle fracture . </S>"
