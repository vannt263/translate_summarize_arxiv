    "neutron - star low - mass x - ray binaries ( ns - lmxbs ) with weak magnetic fields show a wide variety in x - ray spectral and variability properties . based on the correlated behavior of these properties ,",
    "various ns - lmxb subclasses have been recognized ; the atoll sources , the sco - like z sources , and the cyg - like z sources @xcite .",
    "observations of the z - source transient xtej1701462 have shown that these sub - classes are linked through mass accretion rate , with the atolls having the lowest mass accretion rates and the cyg - like z sources having the highest ones @xcite .",
    "the differences in mass accretion rate between the sub - classes is likely the result of differences in system parameters , such as orbital period and properties of the donor star .",
    "however , for many ns - lmxbs these parameters are not well known , making it difficult to look for systematic differences in the system parameters between the ns - lmxb sub - classes .",
    "summary of the values of the spectral index @xmath4 that result from fits to the fire spectrum of gx9 + 1 .",
    "the spectrum was dereddened using different assumptions about @xmath3 , @xmath5 ( ps=@xcite , go=@xcite ) , and the nir extinction law ( n09=@xcite , ccm89=@xcite . )    as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec_nhd ] , we consider the lower @xmath3 values less likely as they imply a rather small distance and low x - ray luminosity for gx9 + 1 . if the actual @xmath3 towards gx9 + 1 is indeed on the high end of the range considered , the positive slope of the nir spectrum of gx9 + 1 points at thermal emission . given the uncertainties in the extinction law and @xmath5 ratios , we refrain from trying to distinguish between viscous heating and heating by x - ray reprocessing .",
    "the positive slope is inconsistent with a dominant contribution from jet synchrotron emission in this wavelength region . in this respect ,",
    "gx9 + 1 is similar to the other two bright atolls and most z sources that have been studied in the nir , which also have nir spectra with positive slopes . for gx9 + 1 and the other bright atolls ,",
    "there is no indication for the presence of a strong jet given that these sources have not been detected at radio wavelengths @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising as jets are commonly associated with ns - lmxbs that are in relatively hard x - ray spectral states .",
    "the bright atolls , on the contrary , are typically found in an x - ray  soft state .",
    "therefore , we can also turn the argument around : the assumption that there is no jet in gx9 + 1 , implies that @xmath4 must be positive .",
    "this can be used as another argument in favor for the higher @xmath3 values towards the system .",
    "if the thermal nir emission is mainly coming from the outer disk , where x - ray heating dominates over viscous heating , there should be a connection between the @xmath0-band luminosity , the x - ray luminosity , and the orbital period ( which sets the size of the disk ) .",
    "the existence of such a correlation has been demonstrated by @xcite , analogously to the work by @xcite for the case of the optical emission of x - ray binaries .",
    "we have used their empirical formula to constrain the orbital period of gx9 + 1 based on its x - ray luminosity and estimated absolute @xmath0 magnitude .",
    "we assume that @xmath670% of the x - ray luminosity in the 0.1218 kev band is emitted in the 210 kev band , for which revnivtsev et al .",
    "derived their relation .",
    "the resulting range is not very restrictive : for @xmath7 kpc and @xmath8 @xmath9 we find @xmath10 h , whereas @xmath11 kpc and @xmath12 @xmath9 give @xmath13 h. again , the choice of @xmath5 ratio has a small ( @xmath145% ) effect .",
    "follow - up photometric monitoring of the nir counterpart may reveal the actual orbital period of gx9 + 1 .",
    "the long - term variation in the x - ray light curve that is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig_longterm ] is unlikely to be related to the orbit but could reflect very - low frequency noise or solar - like magnetic - activity cycles @xcite    the authors would like to thank j.  fridriksson , r.  remillard , p.  sullivan , and m.  matejek for obtaining part of the observations . we acknowledge the use of data products from vvv survey observations made with the vista telescope at the eso paranal observatory under program i d 179.b-2002 .                  , e. , mellier , y. , radovich , m. , et  al .",
