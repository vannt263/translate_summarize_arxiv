    "let @xmath0 be a connected semisimple complex algebraic group , and let @xmath2 be the fixed point subgroup of an algebraic involution @xmath3 of @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath2 is a reductive group , which is connected if @xmath0 is simply - connected .",
    "the lie algebra @xmath4 of @xmath0 splits into the sum of eigenspaces of @xmath3 , @xmath5 where the lie algebra @xmath6 of @xmath2 is the eigenspace of eigenvalue 1 , and @xmath7 is the eigenspace of eigenvalue @xmath8 .",
    "the adjoint action of @xmath0 on @xmath4 , once restricted to @xmath2 , leaves @xmath6 and @xmath7 stable .",
    "therefore @xmath7 provides an interesting representation of @xmath2 , called the isotropy representation , where one may want to study the geometry of the @xmath2-orbits . with this aim",
    ", one looks at the so - called nilpotent cone @xmath9 , which consists of the elements whose @xmath2-orbit closure contains the origin . in this case",
    ", @xmath10 actually consists of the nilpotent elements of @xmath4 which belong to @xmath7 . by a fundamental result of kostant and rallis @xcite , as in the case of the adjoint action of @xmath0 on @xmath4 , there are finitely many nilpotent @xmath2-orbits in @xmath7 .",
    "provided @xmath2 is connected , we restrict our attention to the spherical nilpotent @xmath2-orbits in @xmath7 . here",
    "spherical means with an open orbit for a borel subgroup of @xmath2 , or equivalently with a ring of regular functions which affords a multiplicity - free representation of @xmath2 .",
    "the classification of these orbits is known and due to king @xcite .    in the present paper , we begin a systematic study of the closures of the spherical nilpotent @xmath2-orbits in @xmath7 . in particular , we analyze their normality , and describe the @xmath2-module structure of the coordinate rings of their normalizations .",
    "this is done by making use of the technical machinery of spherical varieties , which is recalled in section  1 .    here",
    "we will deal with the case where @xmath1 is a classical symmetric pair with @xmath2 semisimple , the other cases will be treated in forthcoming papers .",
    "the semisimplicity of @xmath2 is equivalent to the fact that @xmath7 is a simple @xmath2-module , in which case @xmath11 is also called a symmetric space of non - hermitian type .",
    "let @xmath12 be a real form of @xmath0 with lie algebra @xmath13 and cartan decomposition @xmath14 , so that @xmath3 is induced by the corresponding cartan involution of @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath2 is the complexification of a maximal compact subgroup @xmath15 , and the kostant - sekiguchi - dokovi correspondence @xcite establishes a bijection between the set of the nilpotent @xmath12-orbits in @xmath16 and the set of the nilpotent @xmath2-orbits in @xmath7 .",
    "let us briefly recall how it works , more details and references can be found in @xcite .",
    "every non - zero nilpotent element @xmath17 lies in an @xmath18-triple @xmath19 .",

    "then the desired bijective correspondence is constructed as follows : let @xmath31 be an adjoint nilpotent orbit , choose an element @xmath32 belonging to a cayley triple @xmath33 , consider its cayley transform @xmath25 and let @xmath34 : then @xmath35 is the nilpotent @xmath2-orbit corresponding to @xmath36 .    among the nice geometrical properties of the kostant - sekiguchi - dokovi correspondence , we just recall here one result concerning sphericality : the spherical nilpotent @xmath2-orbits in @xmath7 correspond to the adjoint nilpotent @xmath37-orbits in @xmath13 which are multiplicity free as hamiltonian @xmath38-spaces @xcite .    in accordance with the philosophy of the orbit method ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , the unitary representations of @xmath12 should be parametrized by the ( co-)adjoint orbits of @xmath12 . in particular",
    "one is interested in the so - called unipotent representations of @xmath12 , namely those which should be attached to nilpotent orbits .",
    "the @xmath2-module structure of the ring of regular functions on a nilpotent @xmath2-orbit in @xmath7 ( which we compute in our spherical cases ) should give information on the corresponding unitary representation of @xmath37 .",
    "unitary representations that should be attached to the spherical nilpotent @xmath2-orbits are studied in @xcite ( when @xmath0 is a classical group ) and @xcite ( when @xmath0 is the special linear group ) .",

    "the normality and the @xmath2-module structure of the coordinate ring of the closure of a spherical nilpotent @xmath2-orbit in @xmath7 have been studied in several particular cases , with different methods , by nishiyama @xcite , @xcite , by nishiyama , ochiai and zhu @xcite , and by binegar @xcite .    in appendix",

    "it is a finite set . in our case ,",
    "if @xmath63 is the wonderful embedding of @xmath58 , the colors of @xmath58 are just the irreducible components of the complement of the open @xmath65-orbit , and the colors of @xmath63 are just the closures of the colors of @xmath58 , so that the two sets @xmath73 and @xmath74 are naturally identified .    for",
    "any spherical @xmath2-variety @xmath63 one can also define another finite set , the set of spherical roots , usually denoted by @xmath75 . here",
    "we recall its definition only in the wonderful case .",

    "any simple root @xmath70 moves at most two colors , and more precisely there are exactly four cases :    * @xmath70 moves no colors ; * @xmath70 moves two colors , this happens if and only if @xmath91 , and in this case we have 1 .",

    "if @xmath57 is a wonderful subgroup of @xmath2 , the triple @xmath110 , endowed with the map @xmath111 , is called the spherical system of @xmath57 .      in appendix [ b ] , we present the spherical systems of the wonderful subgroups @xmath112 of @xmath2 by providing the sets of spherical roots @xmath82 and the luna diagrams .",
    "the luna diagram of a spherical system consists of the dynkin diagram of @xmath2 decorated with some extra symbols from which one can read off all the data of the spherical system .",
    "let us briefly explain how it works , here we only explain how to read off the missing data ( the set @xmath101 and the map @xmath113 ) , see e.g.  @xcite for a complete description .",
    "every circle ( shadowed or not ) represents a color .",
    "circles corresponding to the same color are joined by a line .",
    "the colors moved by a simple root are close to the corresponding vertex of the dynkin diagram :    * no circle is placed in correspondence of the vertex , * two circles are placed one above and one below the vertex , * one circle is placed below the vertex , * one circle is placed around the vertex .",
    "therefore , the set @xmath114 is given by the vertices with no circles .",
    "it is worth saying that in general @xmath114 is included in @xmath115 .    to read off the map @xmath116 one has to know that an arrow ( it looks more like a pointer but it has a source and a target ) starting from a circle @xmath117 above a vertex @xmath70 and pointing towards a spherical root @xmath118 non - orthogonal to @xmath70 means that @xmath119 .",
    "vice versa , the luna diagram is organized in order that the colors @xmath117 corresponding to circles that lie above the vertices have @xmath120 for all @xmath121 , so if the there is no arrow starting from a circle @xmath117 above a vertex @xmath70 and pointing towards a spherical root @xmath118 non - orthogonal to @xmath70 ( with @xmath122 ) this means that @xmath123 .",
    "these together with the properties of the cartan pairing for colors of type ( a ) , explained above , allows to recover the map @xmath116 .",
    "the two colors moved by @xmath124 will be denoted by @xmath125 and @xmath126 , the former refers to the circle placed above the vertex while the latter refers to the circle placed below .",
    "the color moved by a simple root @xmath127 will be denoted by @xmath128 .    as an example",
    "we show in detail how to recover the map @xmath116 for the first case of the list where a non - empty set @xmath105 occurs , the case [ sss : ccacy ] with @xmath129 .",
    "the group @xmath2 is of type @xmath130 , with @xmath131 and @xmath132 greater than 2 , the set of spherical roots is @xmath133 and the luna diagram is as follows .",
    "@xmath134 here the set @xmath114 is given by the simple roots @xmath135 for all @xmath136 and @xmath137 for all @xmath138 .",
    "the elements of @xmath139 , i.e.  the colors of type ( a ) , are five : @xmath140 we know that for all colors @xmath117 of type ( a ) @xmath141 if @xmath142 and @xmath143 , and @xmath144 otherwise .",
    "therefore , let us show how to determine @xmath145 for all @xmath121 .",
    "first @xmath146 then @xmath147 .",
    "since there is an arrow from @xmath148 to @xmath149 @xmath150 , furthermore @xmath151 , thus we have @xmath152 .",

    "the entire map @xmath116 is as follows .",
    "@xmath161      here we briefly recall the definition and the essential properties of some combinatorial operations on spherical systems which correspond to geometric operations on wonderful varieties , see e.g.  @xcite for some more details and references .",
    "all ( irreducible ) @xmath2-subvarieties of a wonderful @xmath2-variety @xmath63 are wonderful , they are exactly the @xmath2-orbit closures of @xmath63 , and are in correspondence with the subsets of @xmath75 . if @xmath59 are the @xmath2-stable prime divisors of @xmath63 , recall that the spherical roots @xmath162 are @xmath64-eigenvalues occurring respectively in the normal spaces of @xmath78 at @xmath76 , @xmath163 . therefore , every @xmath2-subvariety @xmath164 of @xmath63 is the intersection of some @xmath2-stable prime divisors @xmath165 for some @xmath166 .",
