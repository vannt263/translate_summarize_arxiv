    "to account for the vast majority of mass in the observable universe and to explain its accelerated expansion , the physical cosmology of today requires two outstanding concepts : ( i ) the matter which does not interact with the electromagnetic force - _ dark matter _ , and ( ii )",
    "the hypothetical energy that tends to increase the rate of expansion of the universe - _ dark energy_.    zwicky  @xcite , using virial theorem , had suggested for a possible existence of dark matter long ago , which was later on supported by the studies of rotation curves @xcite , gravitational lensing  @xcite , cmb anisotropy  @xcite and bullet clusters  @xcite .",
    "the advent of inflationary theory  @xcite led to the convincing belief that @xmath4 of matter content of the universe is hidden mass constituted by @xmath5 dark matter and @xmath6 dark energy  @xcite .",
    "dark matter plays a central role in early universe during structure formation and galaxy evolution because of its nature to clump in sub - megaparsec scales .",
    "cobe and cmb experiments suggest that baryonic dark matter is not more than a small fraction of the total dark matter present in the universe @xcite .",
    "more to it , observational constraint regarding neutrino mass and relic neutrino density  @xcite eliminate the possibility of hot dark matter in favor of cold non - baryonic dark matter  @xcite .",
    "however , warm dark matter ( wdm ) which is neither hot nor cold , rather an intermediate one between them , may be considered as a dark matter candidate along with cold dark matter .",
    "thus , @xmath0-cwdm model consisting of a mixture of cold and warm dark matter may be a possible alternative to @xmath0-cdm model .",
    "a favourite choice of wdm is sterile neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that oscillations of active neutrinos in the primeval universe can produce sterile neutrinos .",
    "boyarsky et al .",
    "@xcite have used recent results on @xmath0-cwdm models to show that for each mass above 2 kev , the presence of at least one model of sterile neutrino can serve as dark matter .",
    "it has also been observed  @xcite that sterile neutrinos have the necessary features of a dark matter candidate .",
    "observational results for an accelerating universe  @xcite favored the idea of an accelerating agent that had been referred to as dark energy . in accordance with the data , the already introduced standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) model",
    "is found giving way to @xmath0-cdm model that has an advantage of assuming a nearly scale - invariant primordial perturbations and a universe with no spatial curvature as predicted by the inflationary theory  @xcite .",
    "it is found in good agreement with various observational results  @xcite . in the @xmath0-cdm scenario",
    "the present acceleration of the universe can not be a permanent feature because , structure formation can not proceed during acceleration if it is assumed that dark energy is not coupled to dark matter .",
    "thus , the universe must have undergone a decelerating phase prior to the present accelerating phase  @xcite .",
    "observational evidence  @xcite also supports this idea .",
    "so , the deceleration parameter must have undergone a flip in sign during cosmic evolution .",
    "one of the candidates among the dark energy models is related to dynamic @xmath0 ( for an overview see  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the concept of dark energy and the physics of accelerating universe appears to be inherent in the @xmath0-term of einstein s field equations .",
    "herein , we perform a study of accelerating universe in context of the time - dependent @xmath0 in the field equations and reveal the importance of dynamic @xmath0 while addressing various key issues and some known physical observable like dark matter , dark energy , geometry of the field , deceleration parameter and its sign flip , age of the universe and equation of state parameter .",
    "for the present purpose we consider the einstein s field equations , @xmath7,\\ ] ] which yield friedmann equation @xmath8 for the spherically symmetric flrw metric .",
    "we also get raychaudhuri equation @xmath9 in connection to the evolution scenario for expansion of null or time - like geodesic congruences . here",
    ", @xmath10 is the time - dependent function of the erstwhile _ cosmological constant _ as introduced by einstein , @xmath11 is the scale factor of the universe and @xmath12 is the curvature constant .",
    "the raychaudhuri equation  ( [ akr ] ) at once shows that for @xmath13 , acceleration is initiated by the @xmath0-term only that seems to relate @xmath0 with dark energy .",
    "it also shows that for a positive @xmath0 , the universe may accelerate with the condition @xmath14 i.e. @xmath15 is negative for a positive @xmath16 with a definite contribution of @xmath0 in the acceleration .",
    "the placement of @xmath0 in the field equations itself suggests for it to be a part of total energy momentum @xmath17 of the universe .",
    "in fact , for a variable @xmath0 , solutions of field equations are possible only , if instead of @xmath18 , the total energy momentum @xmath19 is conserved  @xcite and in that case the second term @xmath20 of the above equation acts as an additional source term in the field equations . in the observational front , the data set coming from the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) during its first year of observation show that dark energy behaves in the same manner as that of a cosmological constant to a precision of @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath0 being a time - dependent function , its effect on field equations in regard to the accelerating universe is a pertinent study .",
    "using friedmann equation  ( [ fried ] ) for energy density @xmath22 and the deceleration parameter @xmath23 in raychaudhuri equation  ( [ akr ] ) , one may arrive at following expression for the pressure @xmath24 .",
    "\\label{p01}\\ ] ]    now we consider the phenomenological assumption @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "theoretical and observational values of @xmath0 and @xmath16 for the present day universe , respectively @xmath26  @xcite and @xmath27  @xcite , suggest a more general form @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "as shown later , the physical constraint on @xmath2 requires @xmath30 . in view of this wide observational uncertainty in @xmath2 with regard to its relationship with the time variable @xmath0",
    "should thus be taken carefully while studying field equations for the evolution of the universe .    under the same assumption @xmath31 , for a flat universe , equation ( [ rho01 ] ) reads as @xmath32 giving thereby @xmath33 .",
    "similarly , equation ( [ p01 ] ) reads as @xmath34 here , subscript @xmath35 refers to the values of present day universe .",
    "not ignoring the fact that the flat universe would continue evolving with variable @xmath36 , the present value , @xmath37 , and other related quantities ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) may be treated as dynamic and time variable .",
    "equations ( [ rho02 ] ) and ( [ p02 ] ) yield the barotropic equation of state @xmath42 representing a straight line @xmath43 with @xmath44 . for @xmath45 , equation of state parameter",
    "equals the deceleration parameter and therefore is expected to obey the same physical conditions .",
    "more to it , as a direct consequence of friedmann and raychaudhuri equations , we get while adding equations  ( [ rho02 ] ) and ( [ p02 ] ) @xmath46    it is well known that after the initial introduction of the @xmath0 term by einstein in his cosmological model , a number of times that particular term has been accepted as well as rejected . in the 1960 s zeldovich  @xcite revived the same term as quantum fluctuations of the vacuum .",
    "he showed that as a slow - rolling approximation of a scalar field in robertson - walker space - time , the stress energy tensor takes the form of a cosmological constant .",
    "this idea of zeldovich played a pivotal role on inflationary theory of guth  @xcite .",
    "in fact if we consider a scalar field @xmath47 which obeys the klein - gordon equation , then as slow - rolling approximation we have , @xmath48 . the same situation has been obtained in the present work via equation ( 11 ) for @xmath49 .",
    "this , for the vacuum equation of state , @xmath50  @xcite , provides the condition of constant acceleration ( @xmath51 )  @xcite . in general , the matter - energy density being positive the counterpart negative pressure acts as a repulsive agent and hence the vacuum equation of state has a deep implication in the case of accelerating universe scenario .",
    "obviously , for a collapsing universe with positive @xmath15 , we find @xmath52 and for an accelerating universe we have @xmath53 . its higher limit may be positive depending upon the density .",
    "it is evident from equation  ( [ vacuu ] ) that the fate of the universe depends on @xmath41 .",
    "bearing in mind the hubble s law and the assumption @xmath54 , we may directly arrive from equation  ( [ d1 ] ) at @xmath55 .",
    "this demonstrates that for @xmath56 or for @xmath57 constant , the universe has been evolving through a constant acceleration as indicated earlier  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note here that einstein initially obtained an expanding universe with @xmath58 ( and hence to counteract the dynamical effects of gravity , which would cause the matter - filled universe to collapse , he later on adopted a non - zero @xmath0 to obtain a static model ) while de sitter obtained a similar expanding universe with constant @xmath0 and devoid of any ordinary matter ( which ultimately made einstein to drop the cosmological constant from his general relativistic field equations ) .",
    "we are also curious about the situation @xmath56 which , by virtue of the equation  ( [ rho02 ] ) , makes the energy density to vanish .",
    "it seems to correspond to the special relativistic universe of milne  @xcite under the zero - density limit of the expanding flrw metric with no cosmological constant  @xcite but with @xmath59 .",
    "the available observational data for redshift and scale factor have got flexibility , though limited , to distinguish between a time varying and a constant equation of state  @xcite .",
    "it , therefore , supports a time variable @xmath60 . such a time variable @xmath60 has been used in literature by many authors  @xcite to predict various physical observables of the universe .",
    "some useful limits on @xmath60 was suggested by snia data , @xmath61  @xcite whereas refined values come from combined snia data with cmb anisotropy and galaxy clustering statistics which are @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "moreover , inflation at an early stage scales the parameter @xmath60 , which combined with the above data and dark energy constraint ( @xmath63 ) suggests a physical condition , @xmath64  @xcite . in the light of our previous discussion ,",
    "@xmath41 too must obey the same physical conditions as @xmath60 but for @xmath45 .",
    "the experimental limits , @xmath65  @xcite does fall in this range , which supports the view point that a variable @xmath60 provides physical reason for a nonzero value of @xmath38 and for a limited time variability for it . moreover , the above ranges of the values of @xmath60 and @xmath41 can be achieved if @xmath2 is constrained to lie in the range @xmath66 .        for an accelerating universe",
    ", @xmath38 must be positive , so is @xmath2 .",
    "we plot the linear relationship  ( [ d2 ] ) for different values of @xmath2 within its physical range in fig .",
    "we choose @xmath60 from 0.0 to -1.0 covering the range @xmath67 . to reproduce experimental @xmath41 ,",
    "we require smaller values of @xmath2 for smaller values of @xmath60 .",
    "the hypotenuse and the base of the bold face triangle , respectively represent @xmath68 ( or @xmath56 ) and @xmath69 , thereby representing the full physical region .",
    "we may compare @xmath68 plot with other lines of the figure representing positive values of @xmath2 ( or respective values of @xmath38 ) to extract the effect of @xmath38 on @xmath41 .",
    "the thin solid line shows the case , @xmath45 .",
    "we find @xmath41 negative within the bold face triangular region demarcated by physical conditions @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the values @xmath72 ( or @xmath73 ) lies below the experimental @xmath41 . towards the smaller values of @xmath2 ( @xmath74 ) and higher values of @xmath60 ( @xmath75 ) , @xmath41 is observed to flip the sign in the accelerating epoch .",
    "before the present cosmic acceleration , which had started only recently ( a few gyr earlier ) , the universe was expanding with deceleration .",
    "so , at the turnover stage ( from deceleration to acceleration ) , the deceleration parameter must have changed its sign .",
    "it is worth noting here that @xmath41 and @xmath2 ( hence @xmath76 determine the fate of the universe .",
    "one may arrive at the same conclusion through recognizing the fact that density is directly proportional to @xmath38 .",
    "hence , time variability of @xmath38 can not be put aside while addressing the geometry of the universe .",
    "one of the predictions of the inflation theory is a flat universe with a large value of @xmath0 in the early stages of the universe .",
    "thus , one may argue that it is the cosmological parameter that determined the geometry of the universe and made it flat during inflation .    in this connection",
    "we mention that the equation ( 10 ) is nothing but a special form of the general equation which can be obtained easily from the equations ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) for flat universe ( @xmath77 ) and using the ansatz @xmath31 .",
    "it is also to be noted here that the fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] demonstrates the evolution of the universe for a number of selected values of @xmath60 .",
    "this implies that general form of equation ( 10 ) will show the same behavior in the @xmath78 versus @xmath79 plot .",
    "the equation ( 10 ) ( or it s general form ) seems to be telling us that the cosmological constant scales , via @xmath80 , roughly as the ` velocity ' squared of the universe .",
    "so , equation ( 10 ) then will remain valid for a wide range of cosmological epoch so far as the values of @xmath79 and @xmath78 are concerned .",
    "we now focus on the implications of @xmath38 on the hidden mass .",
    "it should be mentioned here that a combination of type ia supernova data and cmb anisotropy gives a best fit value for the dark energy density parameter @xmath81 as @xmath82  @xcite .",
    "this value of @xmath81 yields , @xmath83  @xcite .",
    "we may , from equation  ( [ rho02 ] ) , deduce that @xmath84 is equivalent to @xmath85 as have been suggested for other type of phenomenological @xmath0-model  @xcite .",
    "it may also be shown that the ratio @xmath86 gives a measure for the hidden mass of the universe .",
    "on the basis of the phenomenological model @xmath87",
    "@xcite , the present density has been obtained as @xmath88 , which is close to the lower limit of the value obtained by guth  @xcite : @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , knowing the measured galactic mass density , @xmath90  @xcite , one finds @xmath91 suggesting thereby that the galactic mass density is about @xmath92 - @xmath93 of the total mass density of the present universe .",
    "hence , according to the present model there is hidden mass ranging from @xmath94 - @xmath95 , which seemingly approves the value of ref .",
    "variation of @xmath86 is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] with respect to @xmath38 and @xmath2 .",
    "higher values of @xmath38 and lower values of @xmath2 demonstrate large missing mass .    on the basis of the most recent observations weinberg  @xcite reports the age of the universe as @xmath96 gyr .",
    "dynamic @xmath0 model has also been used to estimate the age  @xcite , however it seems to suffer either from low - age like @xmath97 gyr  @xcite that is less than the estimated globular cluster ages , @xmath98 gyr  @xcite or it is as high as @xmath99 gyr  @xcite . with the variations of @xmath2 and @xmath38",
    "we plot our calculations in the upper panel of fig .",
    "we notice that all the values of @xmath2 within its physical range reproduce observed age of the universe but with a suitable @xmath38 .",
    "one requires , smaller values of @xmath38 , for the smaller values of @xmath2 in order to be close with observation .",
    "this sheds light on the important time variability of @xmath37 and its correlation to @xmath37 , @xmath100 .",
    "the present work may be considered as a part of a series of papers dealing with the behaviour of some phenomenological @xmath0-dark energy models under specific assumptions on the physical parameters @xmath0 , @xmath79 , g etc .",
    "@xcite . in those works various aspects of @xmath0 models",
    "have already been explored .",
    "so , the present work has been carried out in the same line and is guided by the motivation of revealing some new features of dark energy in the framework of the present accelerating universe . in the present paper , it has been possible to arrive at various interesting physical ideas of modern cosmology through simple considerations of time variability of the observables of flat universe , specially @xmath38 .",
    "we have considered the phenomenological assumption , @xmath101 , for the full physical range of @xmath2 and hence the relevance of time variable @xmath0 with regard to various key issues like dark matter , dark energy , geometry of the field , age of the universe , deceleration parameter and barotropic equation of state has been trivially addressed .",
    "interestingly , the deceleration parameter @xmath41 and the barotropic equation of state parameter @xmath60 have been found to obey a straight line relationship ( equation  ( [ d2 ] ) ) with slope @xmath44 for a flat universe described by friedmann and raychaudhuri equations . for @xmath45 ,",
    "both the parameters , @xmath60 and @xmath41 , are equal and hence are expected to obey the same physical conditions .",
    "the assumption , @xmath59 , seems to represent the milne universe .",
    "it has been shown that within the physical limits of accelerating universe , @xmath41 may flip its sign towards lower end values of @xmath2 and higher end values of @xmath60 .",
