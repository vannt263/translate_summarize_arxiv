    "the frontier field of cold ( @xmath0 k ) and ultracold ( @xmath0 mk ) gas - phase molecular physics has brought forth many innovations @xcite . among motivating challenges is the prospect of studying collision processes , especially chemical reactions , under `` matterwave '' conditions .",
    "reaching that realm , where quantum phenomena become much more prominent than in ordinary `` warm '' collisions , requires attaining _ relative _ velocities so low that the debroglie wavelength becomes comparable to or longer than the size of the collision partners . that has been achieved recently for reactions of alkali atoms with alkali dimers formed from ultracold trapped alkali atoms by photoassociation or feshbach resonances @xcite . with the aim of widening the chemical scope",
    ", much effort has been devoted to developing means to slow and cool preexisting molecules .",
    "( compilations are given in @xcite . ) for chemical reactions , however , as yet it has not proved feasible to obtain sufficient yields at very low collision energies , using either trapped reactants or crossed molecular beams .",
    "the major handicap in such experiments is that _ both _",
    "reactants must contribute adequate flux with very low translational energy .",
    "merged codirectional beams with closely matched velocities offer a way to obtain far higher intensity at very low _ relative _ collision energies , since then _ neither _ reactant needs to be particularly slow .",
    "moreover , many molecular species not amenable for slowing techniques become available as reactants .",
    "merged beams have been extensively used with ions and/or neutrals formed by charge transfer , to perform experiments at relative energies below 1 ev with beams having kev energies @xcite .",
    "a key advantage is a kinematic feature that deamplifies contributions to the relative energy by velocity spreads in the parent beams . by virtue of precise control feasible with ions , the velocity spreads are also quite small , typically @xmath10.1% or less . for thermal molecular beams , such as we consider here , the spreads are usually @xmath110% or more . that enables attaining low relative collision energy , but much lower energies and improved resolution",
    "can be obtained by narrowing the spreads to @xmath11% , which now appears feasible at an acceptable cost in intensity .",
    "surprisingly , application of merged beams to low - energy collisions of neutral molecules has been long neglected .",
    "we have come across only three previous , very brief suggestions @xcite .",
    "our treatment accompanies experiments now underway at texas a&m university @xcite .    in sec .",
    "ii , in order to assess the major role of velocity spreads in merged beams , we evaluate the average relative kinetic energy , @xmath2 and its rms spread @xmath3 by integrating over velocity distributions familiar for molecular beams . reduced variable plots are provided that display the dependence on the ratio of most probable velocities in the merged beams , their velocity spreads , and merging angle . in secs .",
    "iii and iv we discuss experimental prospects , limitations , and options .",
    "for beams with lab speeds @xmath4 and @xmath5 intersecting at an angle @xmath6 , the relative kinetic energy is @xmath7 with @xmath8 the reduced mass . for merged beams it is feasible to restrict the angle @xmath6 to a small spread , fixed by geometry and typically only about a degree or so about @xmath9 . here we evaluate the average of @xmath10 over the beam velocity distributions , @xmath11\\ ] ] and the rms spread , @xmath12^{1/2}.\\ ] ] these require only @xmath13 , with k = 1 - 4 , for the individual beams .",
    "we obtain analytic expressions for averages over velocity distributions for beams formed by effusive flow , by supersonic expansion , and by a rotating supersonic nozzle .",
    "figure 1 illustrates these distributions . for the supersonic beams ,",
    "three widths are shown ; the broadest ( @xmath1 10% ) is typical , the narrowest ( @xmath1 1% ) is near the best achieved in stark or zeeman molecular decelerators exploiting phase stability and transverse focusing @xcite .",

    "is governed by a single parameter , @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath17 the source temperature .",

    "the curves given are for intersection angles near zero , pertinent for merged beams . for",
    "matched beam velocities , with @xmath36 , both @xmath37 and @xmath3 are smallest .",
    "there , for small @xmath6 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are less than the nominal relative kinetic energy , @xmath38 , for a perpendicular collision ( @xmath39 ) by factors of only about 5 and 3 , respectively . as @xmath40 decreases below @xmath41 , @xmath37 and @xmath3 increase in nearly parallel fashion .",
    "accordingly , whether or not the merged beam velocities are closely matched , @xmath3 exceeds @xmath2 appreciably ( by @xmath1 40% when @xmath36 ) .",
    "the resolution of the relative kinetic energy hence is worse than seen in eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) for the beam kinetic energy itself .",
    "the velocity distribution for effusive beams is the same as for a bulk gas .",
    "thus , @xmath2 and @xmath3 for gas mixtures cooled by cryogenic means can be obtained from the merged beam results by merely setting @xmath42 , equivalent to integrating over all angles of collision .      a standard approximation , @xmath43 ^ 2 \\}\\ ] ] for supersonic beams characterizes the velocity distribution by the flow velocity u along the centerline of the beam , and a width parameter @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , termed the parallel or longitudinal temperature , pertains to the molecular translational motion relative to the flow velocity @xcite . according to the thermal conduction model @xcite , @xmath46",

    "( 8) and ( 9 ) , with @xmath41 and @xmath40 replaced by @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    ". here @xmath69 , given by eq.(12 ) , may differ for the two beams ( @xmath70 = 1 , 2 ) if their velocity widths ( @xmath71 ) differ .",
    "figure 3 displays the dependence of @xmath2 and @xmath3 on the ratio of flow velocities of the beams , @xmath72 , and their velocity widths .",
    "curves are shown for @xmath73 and @xmath74 , to illustrate that the dependence on the merging angle is weak if the velocity widths of the beams are fairly large ( _ cf_. fig.2 ) but for @xmath37 becomes significant if the velocity widths are small ( _ cf_. fig . 6 below ) .",
    "the dependence on the magnitude of the flow velocities is included simply by adopting units for @xmath37 and @xmath3 that compare them with the relative kinetic energy for collisions at about the most probable beam velocities ( nearly equal to @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) at right angles ( @xmath75 ) , or equivalently in a bulk gas .",
    "we designate that by @xmath76 . as seen in panel ( a ) , if the merged beam velocities are precisely matched ( @xmath77 ; @xmath78 ) the collision kinetic energy @xmath2 is very sensitive to the velocity widths .",
    "in contrast , when the beam flow velocities are unmatched by more than about 15% ( i.e. , @xmath79 ) , the ratio @xmath80 becomes nearly independent of the velocity widths and grows larger as the unmatch increases .",
    "panel ( b ) shows that regardless of whether the beam velocities are matched or not , the spread in relative kinetic energy , @xmath3 , varies strongly with the velocity widths .",
    "panel ( c ) plots the ratio @xmath81 , which defines the energy resolution . whereas for closely matched beams",
    "@xmath2 is minimal , @xmath3 then approaches its maximal value .",
    "indeed , for matched beams with @xmath82 , the resolution ratio , @xmath81 , is near @xmath83 ; that is just as poor as found in fig . 2 for effusive beams .",
    "to improve the resolution ratio for matched beams requires narrowing the velocity widths .",
    "table ii compares , both for the single beam and matched merged beams , effects of reducing the spread from @xmath84 = 0.1 to 0.01 . for the single beam ,",
    "the change in average kinetic energy is very slight , whereas the rms spread in the kinetic energy shrinks tenfold . for the merged beams ,",
    "the relative kinetic energy is lowered by a factor of 25 , and its rms spread by a factor of 100 ; so the resolution ratio is only improved fourfold . the resolution ratio can be lowered further if the merged beam velocities are unmatched , but that raises the averaged relative kinetic energy .",
    "figure 4 displays the trade - offs involved . to obtain optimally low @xmath2 requires nearly exact matching ; that can provide @xmath85 for @xmath84 = 0.01 or @xmath86 for @xmath84 = 0.02 .",
    "however , for exact matching , the resolution ratio is only @xmath87 = 0.35 for @xmath84 = 0.01 and surges to 0.8 for @xmath84 = 0.02 . to attain resolution of 0.2 or 0.3 even with @xmath84 = 0.01 requires @xmath88 = 0.91 or 0.94 and hence would increase @xmath80 to @xmath89 or @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "the upshot is , to improve the resolution ratio by a factor of less than 2 ( from 0.35 to 0.2 ) by unmatching , requires increasing @xmath2 by a factor of 25 .",
