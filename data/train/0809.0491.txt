    "approximately one out of five decays of the @xmath7-quark produces a @xmath2-quark accompanied by leptons .",
    "those semileptonic decays provide information about quark masses , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath8 , as well as properties of hadrons containing heavy quarks . in order to access that information , measurements of the decay probability and distributions",
    "are compared with theoretical predictions that account for radiative corrections , quark masses , and non - perturbative effects of strong interactions .",
    "given that the strong coupling constant at the mass - scale of the @xmath7-quark is quite large , @xmath9 , and that the present uncertainty in @xmath8 approaches the one - percent level @xcite , it is important to determine the second - order effects , @xmath10 .",
    "the full @xmath10 correction to the decay rate was first calculated in the limit of a massless produced quark ( relevant for the decay @xmath11 ) @xcite .",
    "effects of the @xmath2-quark mass were known , until recently , only in the so called brodsky - lepage - mackenzie ( blm ) approximation @xcite , estimating the largest part of the second order corrections using the running of @xmath12 .",
    "the remaining , non - blm corrections , are usually smaller and much more difficult to determine .",
    "they were known only in three special points of lepton kinematics : the zero recoil , where the leptons are emitted back - to - back and the produced quark remains at rest @xcite ; the maximum recoil , with the vanishing invariant mass of the leptons @xcite ; and the intermediate recoil , where the invariant mass of the leptons equals that of the @xmath2-quark @xcite . in the latter study ,",
    "the information from all three points was used to estimate the @xmath10 correction to the total decay rate with a massive @xmath2-quark .",
    "very recently , two independent studies determined the full mass dependence of the non - blm corrections : in @xcite , the calculation was performed numerically for arbitrary quark masses , and in @xcite an expansion around small @xmath13 was obtained analytically .",
    "the two methods are very different , with the former being more accurate at large , and the latter at small @xmath14 , but they agree very well in the physically interesting region of @xmath15 . unfortunately , the resulting non - blm correction disagrees almost by a factor of two with the estimate found in @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present paper is twofold .",
    "first , we want to check the intermediate - recoil expansion presented in @xcite . among the three kinematical points on which the estimate @xcite of the total correction was based",
    ", the intermediate - recoil is the only one not checked by an independent calculation .",
    "an expansion is constructed from the opposite limit than in @xcite : whereas there the expansion was around the zero - recoil limit , here we start from the vanishing @xmath14 , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : triangle ] .",
    "in addition , the old expansion around the zero - recoil limit is repeated and extended to higher orders .",
    "our second goal is to clarify the source of the disagreement between the three - point estimate and the recent explicit calculations .",

    "the decay width is also known analytically along the whole zero recoil line .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to the decay width @xmath17 .",

    "the arrow originating from the zero - recoil line corresponds to the expansion done in @xcite ( and repeated in the present paper ) , while the dashed arrow coming from the zero mass point corresponds to the expansion presented here for the first time .",
    "ultimately , these expansions should give a consistent value for the decay width @xmath22 .",

    "this is related to the shift induced by the higher - order terms , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : czar ] .",
    "there we see that the full correction is less negative than previously assumed , thus the difference with the blm correction is more positive ( larger ) .",
    "since the zero- and the intermediate - recoil points are close to each other , even a small shift of the value at one of them may be amplified in the integral of the fitted function .    after the integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : integration ] ) , this change leads to the new value @xmath297 which now agrees with eq .",
    "( [ eq : ak ] ) .",
    "the error estimated by comparing with the blm case is about 12 per cent . by correcting the mistake in renormalization and including more terms in the expansion from zero recoil",
    ", we have brought the disagreement from about a factor of two down to @xmath298 per cent , within the quoted error margins .",
    "further improvement is possible using a better method of fitting the polynomial . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi ] ) , we normalized the points to the tree level result @xmath293 .",
    "we find that , if this normalization is not done , i.e. instead we use , @xmath299 the polynomial fit gives a much better estimate of the exact result . with this adjustment of the fitting procedure",
    ", we end up with a final non - blm estimate of @xmath300 , a significant improvement . without knowing the shape of the @xmath279 curve",
    ", we can not say whether this is a numerical coincidence .",
    "we have also performed this fitting for the @xmath301 corrections and blm approximation .",
    "both estimates give results that are within @xmath302 per cent of the exact known result and are more accurate than using an analog of eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi ] ) for the fit .    in the more recent papers @xcite",
    "the authors use a different set of parameters for their calculations , namely @xmath303 . for easy comparison",
    ", we have also calculated the non - blm corrections with this set of parameters .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq : zeta ] ) for the fitting procedure and the expansion about @xmath165 presented here , we find @xmath304 , as compared with the result of @xmath305 from @xcite .",
    "to summarize : we have corrected an error in the strong coupling constant normalization in the previous intermediate - recoil expansion .",
    "we have extended that expansion to several higher orders in the parameter @xmath164 , describing the difference between @xmath14 and @xmath306 . we have confirmed the correctness of that expansion by constructing a new one , also along the intermediate - recoil diagonal but around its other end , corresponding to @xmath307 .",
    "this analysis allowed us to re - evaluate the fit of the @xmath279 curve based on the three kinematical points , and remove the disagreement between the correction to the total rate @xmath263 obtained from such a fit , and that obtained from the direct four - loop calculations @xcite . with this result , the full massive calculation of the @xmath10 corrections to the semileptonic @xmath7-quark decay rate is confirmed .",
    "this work was supported by science and engineering research canada .",
    "the expansions used to obtain the maximum recoil point for our polynomial fit were calculated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the two expansions agree very well except for the region with @xmath309 .",
    "this discrepancy can be attributed to the omission of the amplitude of @xmath310 from the expansion in @xcite . for completeness",
    ", we have calculated this contribution for both maximum recoil and intermediate recoil , as this expansion was also not included in @xcite .",
    "these expansions are calculated as threshold expansions in terms of @xmath311 given by,@xmath312 where the @xmath313 indicates the factor used when calculating the maximum recoil , @xmath314 , or intermediate recoil , @xmath315 , expansion .",
    "the methods used for both expansions are discussed in @xcite .",
    "this calculation relies on the ability to reduce the four particle phase space integrals needed , into a product of two particle phase spaces .    for the maximum recoil case",
