    "the fluctuations of virtual charged particles in the vacuum of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) give rise to nonlinear , effective couplings between electromagnetic fields .",
    "while this has been realized theoretically already in the early days of qed @xcite , the pure electromagnetic nonlinearity of the quantum vacuum still awaits its direct experimental verification on macroscopic scales .",
    "the advent and planning of high - intensity laser facilities of the petawatt class has triggered a huge interest in ideas and proposals to probe quantum vacuum nonlinearities in realistic all - optical experimental set - ups ; for recent reviews , see @xcite .",
    "typical examples are proposals intended to verify vacuum birefringence @xcite that can be searched for using macroscopic magnetic fields @xcite or with the aid of high - intensity lasers @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "alternative concepts suggest the use of time - varying fields and high - precision interferometry @xcite .",
    "other commonly studied nonlinear vacuum effects are direct light - by - light scattering @xcite , photon splitting @xcite , and spontaneous vacuum decay in terms of schwinger pair - production in electric fields @xcite . further optical signatures of quantum vacuum nonlinearities are those based on interference effects @xcite , photon - photon scattering in the form of laser - pulse collisions @xcite , quantum reflection @xcite , photon merging @xcite , and harmonic generation from laser - driven vacuum @xcite .",
    "related effects have also been discussed in the context of searching for minicharged particles @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the phenomenon of stimulated photon emission from the vacuum in the presence of a strong space - time dependent electromagnetic field ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) . focusing on a comparably simple electromagnetic field profile , which should nevertheless capture the essential features of the electromagnetic fields generated in the focal spots of real high - intensity laser beams , we provide estimates for the numbers of emitted photons attainable with present and near future high - intensity laser facilities .",
    "the experimental set - up we have in mind is as follows : a high - intensity laser pulse is split equally into two pulses , which are separated and directed in a counter - propagation geometry .",
    "both pulses are focused such that they evolve along the well - defined envelope of a gaussian beam and their foci overlap .",
    "this results in a macroscopic strong - field region about the beam waist ( cf . also fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] , below ) .",
    "the superposition of the two counter - propagating electromagnetic waves results in a standing electromagnetic wave which  in contrast to a single plane wave  is characterized by at least one nonzero electromagnetic field invariant . the idea is to look for induced photons emitted from the strong - field region and to be detected in the field free region .",
    "these photons can be considered as emitted from the vacuum subjected to the space - time dependent macroscopic laser field ",
    "whose microscopic composition in terms of laser photons is not resolved  enabling and stimulating the emission process .",
    "of course , this scenario can alternatively be interpreted in terms of microscopic laser photon scattering and deflection in the collision of two laser pulses . from this perspective , the emitted photons correspond to the outgoing photons carrying the imprint of the collision process , i.e. , outgoing photons whose properties ( in particular their polarization characteristics and propagation directions ) differ from the incident laser photons brought into collision .",
    "however , we believe that viewing laser pulse collision processes in terms of a stimulated emission process , i.e. , viewing the laser pulses as macroscopic fields , rather than in terms of the constituting laser photons , allows for a particularly intuitive and elegant theoretical treatment . in this framework",
    "it is easy to vary detector sizes and ask for the number of photons carrying the signature of vacuum nonlinearity to be registered in any given solid angle interval , which is not so straightforward in other approaches .",
    "in addition , and in contrast to previous studies , e.g. , @xcite , we can straightforwardly study the polarization properties of the outgoing photons .",
    "moreover , and from a conceptual level even more important , our approach will also allow us to study photon emission from the vacuum subjected to macroscopic field configurations which are hard to describe as a collection of photons , like , e.g. , rotating inhomogeneous magnetic fields .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : calculation ] we outline the derivation of the stimulated photon emission rate , and provide explicit analytical results for a particular electromagnetic field configuration , mimicking the superposition of two counter - propagating laser pulses with the same characteristics . in the diffraction limit",
    "these expressions are of a particularly simple form .",
    "most strikingly , the directional emission characteristics of the induced photons becomes independent of the laser parameters and is described by a generic function .",
    "the number of photons emitted in a specific spherical angle is obtained straightforwardly upon integration of the directional emission characteristics and multiplication with an overall factor determined by the parameters of the used lasers .",
    "hence , we can easily provide estimates of the number of emitted photons for any desired laser parameters .",
    "section  [ seq : ex+res ] is devoted to the discussion of some explicit results .",
    "we end with conclusions and an outlook in sec .",

    "note that for real gaussian beams ( for @xmath58 ) the field decrease over the rayleigh range is described by a lorentzian profile , which is harder to tackle analytically and thus , would result in less transparent and handy expressions for the vacuum emission probability .",
    "we argue that for our purposes the gaussian profile captures all relevant features , and  when providing experimental estimates below  will actually identify @xmath59 .",
    "moreover , we neglect diffraction spreading and wavefront curvature effects about the beam waist , arguing that within the rayleigh range they amount to subleading corrections . outside the rayleigh range",

    "let us emphasize that both invariants   vanish for a single gaussian laser beam , modeled by one of the field configurations labeled by @xmath65 in eq .  .",
    "however , nonzero invariants are attainable by superimposing multiple , e.g. , two , gaussian beams . note that macroscopic , non - vanishing invariants could also be realized by a single laser beam if higher laser modes are utilized .",
    "however , in this case the focus area is increased in comparison to the @xmath42 mode and correspondingly the available laser intensity diminished .",
    "another option is to consider a single gaussian beam in the limit of a substantial beam divergence @xmath66 @xcite , such that wavefront curvature effects become dominant and can not be neglected ; cf . also @xcite . of course",
    ", under theses circumstances the laser beam does no longer correspond to a slight modification of a plane - wave like electromagnetic field configuration and both invariants   can assume nonzero values , facilitating stimulated photon emission from the vacuum .",
    "at least one invariant can be rendered nonzero by superimposing the two counter - propagating laser beams introduced in eq .   above .",

    ": this becomes particularly obvious when looking at the directional emission characteristics for the total number of photons depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ntotal ] ( left ) .",
    "all photons that might have their polarization vector in the same direction as the original laser field lie on the intersection of the @xmath180-@xmath181 plane with the three dimensional emission characteristics .",
    "clearly , their contribution to the integral   yielding the number of emitted photon number in three dimensions is negligible as it is to be multiplied with @xmath197 when performing the integration over any solid angle interval . in all other emission directions ( @xmath198 )",
    "the induced photons originating from the stimulated emission process are polarized differently than the laser , implying that basically all emitted photons are polarized differently than the laser beam triggering the effect .    in turn",
    ", this could be used to distinguish the signal ( emitted photons ) from the laser photons of the same frequency .",
    "for example , equipping a photon detector with a polarizer blocking the polarization of the laser beam along @xmath43 still a significant fraction of the total numbers of photons emitted in directions outside the laser beam , @xmath199 , should be detectable : all photons with a nonvanishing polarization component perpendicular to @xmath43 will actually contribute to the signal .",
    "with respect to such measurement , our result   for the truly perpendicular polarized emission signal @xmath200 ( cf . also fig .",
    "[ fig : nperpx ] and tab .",
    "[ tab : lasers ] ) just amounts to the absolute minimum number of emitted photons to be detected .",
    "in this paper we have studied and interpreted a specific laser pulse collision process in terms of stimulated single photon emission from the vacuum in strong space - time dependent electromagnetic fields .",
    "more specifically , we have focused on a particular field configuration mimicking the electromagnetic field in the focal spot of two counter - propagating , linearly polarized high - intensity laser beams with their polarization vectors pointing in the same direction .",
    "it would be interesting to extend our study to other electromagnetic field configurations attainable in the overlapping foci of two high - intensity laser pulses , e.g. , to deviate from the counter - propagation geometry by letting the beams collide under an relative angle and to study other laser polarizations .",
    "moreover , the electromagnetic field profiles to mimic the laser beams should eventually be improved to account for more features of real , experimentally attainable pulses .",
    "in particular the gaussian profile mimicking the finite rayleigh length in the present study should be replaced by a lorentzian profile . besides",
    ", in a latter step of this program also a dedicated detection set - up should be worked out and the precise numbers of the detectable photons originating from the stimulated emission process should be specified .",
    "let us emphasize again that in the present study we rather intended to underpin our viewpoint of interpreting the vacuum subjected to macroscopic strong electromagnetic ( laser ) fields as source term for outgoing photons . to this end , we present first estimates of the photon numbers attainable from the effect of stimulated photon emission in an all - optical experimental set - up within this framework .    finally , and perhaps most importantly , the approach adopted by us can be straightforwardly extended to processes involving @xmath201 external photons , with @xmath202 , attainable by expanding the effective lagrangian   with @xmath203 to @xmath204 ; cf .",
