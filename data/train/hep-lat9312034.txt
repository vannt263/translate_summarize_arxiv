    "the direct calculation of hadron structure functions by current overlap techniques is based on the simulation of the euclidean hadronic matrix elements @xmath1 | h({\\bf 0 } ) \\rangle $ ] , where @xmath2 is the full electromagnetic current and @xmath3 are the @xmath4 , @xmath5 quark flavor current densities .",
    "such calculations are likely to be quite costly , so it seems worthwhile to check the validity of this approach by less ambitious calculations utilizing the basic current overlap technique . the longitudinal piece ( corresponding to @xmath6 above , where @xmath7 ) of structure functions for mesonic systems provides such a test@xcite .",
    "we expect for the pion that vector dominance should hold , resulting in a known elastic limit for both the @xmath8 ( same flavor ) and @xmath9 ( different flavor ) sectors .",
    "this calculation serves to test whether the lattice size is large enough in space and time , the size of statistical errors , and other important issues . since we use the conserved lattice current , there are also many useful numerical identities which serve as checks on the calculation . in constructing these four point functions ,",
    "we make multiple use of the sequential source technique@xcite for quark propagators .",
    "our work so far indicates that the full electromagnetic amplitude should be attainable for low momentum transfers ; however , we see no indications of inelastic contributions in our results . in this brief report",
    "we will concentrate on issues relating to systematics and statistical errors .",
    "the structure function can be obtained from@xcite @xmath10 where , @xmath11 | \\pi^{+}({\\bf 0 } ) \\rangle .",

    "we may study the form factor by using the relation @xcite @xmath13    for this calculation we utilized a @xmath0 lattice and @xmath14 in the quenced approximation .",
    "we have omitted disconnected quark graph amplitudes because of the difficulty of simulating the corresponding correlation functions . in constructing the @xmath15",
    "there are three distinct classes of connected diagrams which contribute ; see figure 1 where the the effect of the currents is represented by an `` .",
    "the different flavor piece ( figure 1(a ) ) is calculated by combining quark propagator lines from source and sink ; this involves two quark inversions per configuration .",
    "in addition , the same flavor amplitude contains both direct '' ( figure 1(b ) ) and z - graph \" ( figure 1(c ) ) contributions because of the indistinguishability of the two currents .",
    "these are calculated separately and the results added together ;    three additional propagators are needed to do this .",
    "it is the @xmath16 sum in equation ( [ 2 ] ) which is difficult to perform when the currents involve the same flavor because of quark lines going from @xmath17 to @xmath18 ( @xmath19 and @xmath16 both summed ) .",
    "however , the statistical error bars on @xmath20 were reduced by means of the following strategy .",
    "we use a charge density sheet operator , @xmath21 using this when @xmath22 , @xmath23 can be written ( using translational independence ) as @xmath24 | \\pi^{+}({\\bf 0 } ) \\rangle , \\label{5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the number of lattice points in the @xmath26 direction .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the effect of using this technique at @xmath27 and @xmath28 on @xmath29 configurations .",
    "the fourier reinforced ( @xmath30 ) result used the @xmath31 operator , whereas the nonreinforced result fixes @xmath16 in ( [ 2 ] ) to a single location@xcite .",
    "the two results in figure 2 are consistent with one another , although the @xmath32 result is systematically higher .",
    "both are consistent with a single exponential behavior ( no inelastic part ) , even at small time separations between the currents , @xmath33 , although there is a mysterious bump in the @xmath32 result .",
    "this could be a statistical fluctuation or an effect of getting too near the sink interpolation fields .",
    "it is seen that the uncertainties in @xmath20 are significantly reduced in the @xmath32 amplitude .",
    "zero momentum smeared pion interpolation fields are used at source and sink which are located on the time edges of the lattice in order to maximize the time extent available for measurements .",
    "extensive numerical tests were performed on the @xmath34 amplitude to make sure nonvacuum contaminations do not occur ; no such effects were seen .",
    "this quantity was reconstructed so that the two nonlocal , conserved charge densities were centered in time between the time edges .",
    "when measuring @xmath23 , we used an extended source ( @xmath32 case ) or a point charge source ( non @xmath32 ) on time steps @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the maximum time separation between the two charge operators is @xmath37 in the same flavor case but @xmath38 in the different flavor case .",
    "we find that the the same flavor spatial correlation function is significantly smaller than the different flavor one .",
    "it is dominated by the direct graph ; the z - graph contributes only at small time separations and serves to make the correlation function marginally wider . at small @xmath33",
    "we see a spatial anisotropy similar to  @xcite .",
    "figure 3 shows the full pion amplitude @xmath39 again at @xmath40 for @xmath41 compared with the different flavor piece @xmath42 ( for which the sum in ( [ 2 ] ) is easy ) . using @xmath32 , the error bars on",

    "both results are apparently tending to the vector dominance elastic limit .",
    "it is possible to measure both elastic and inelastic processes from our hadronic amplitudes .",
    "the various different flavor amplitudes are especially useful because of their small error bars .",
    "they contain the information to do a survey of the form factors of all groundstate nonsinglet mesons .",
    "this work was partially supported by the national center for supercomputing applications and the national science foundation under grant phy-@xmath43 and utilized the ncsa cray systems at the university of illinois at urbana - champaign .",
    "9 the longitudinal piece of the pion structure function vanishes at both low energies ( no longitudinal photons ) and high energies ( callan - gross relation ) and thus is almost purely elastic .",
