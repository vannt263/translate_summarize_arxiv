    "the measurement of the electric polarizability @xmath10 of an atom is a difficult experiment : this quantity can not be measured by spectroscopy , which can access only to polarizability differences , and one should rely either on macroscopic quantity measurements such as the electric permittivity ( or the index of refraction ) or on electric deflection of an atomic beam . for a review on polarizability measurements , we refer the reader to the book by kresin and bonin @xcite . for alkali atoms ,",
    "all the accurate experiments were based on the deflection of an atomic beam by an inhomogeneous electric field and , in the case of lithium , the most accurate previous measurement was done in 1974 by bederson and co - workers @xcite , with the following result @xmath11 m@xmath2 .",
    "however , in 2003 , amini and gould , using an atomic fountain @xcite , have measured the polarizability of cesium atom with a @xmath12% relative uncertainty , which is presently the smallest uncertainty on the electric polarisability of an alkali atom .",
    "atom interferometry , which can measure any weak modification of the atom propagation , is perfectly adapted to measure the electric polarizability of an atom : this was demonstrated in 1995 by d. pritchard and co - workers @xcite with an experiment on sodium atom and they obtained a very high accuracy , with a statistical and systematic uncertainties both equal to @xmath13% .",
    "this experiment was and remains difficult because an electric field must be applied on only one of the two interfering beams : one must use a capacitor with a thin electrode , a septum , which can be inserted between the two atomic beams .    using our lithium atom interferometer @xcite ,",
    "we have made an experiment very similar to the one of d. pritchard @xcite and we have measured the electric polarizability of lithium with a @xmath4% uncertainty , limited by the uncertainty on the mean atom velocity and not by the atom interferometric measurement itself @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we are going to describe in detail our experiment with emphasis on the improvements with respect to the experiments of d. pritchard s group @xcite : we have designed a capacitor with an analytically calculable electric field ; we have obtained a considerably larger phase sensitivity , thanks to a large atomic flux and an excellent fringe visibility ; finally our interferometer , which uses laser diffraction , is species selective : the contribution of any impurity ( heavier alkali atoms , lithium dimers ) to the signal can be neglected .",
    "we may recall that several experiments using atom interferometers have exhibited a sensitivity to an applied electric field @xcite but these experiments were not aimed at an accurate measurement of the electric polarizability .",
    "two other atom interferometry experiments @xcite using an inelastic diffraction process , so that the two interfering beams are not in the same internal state , have measured the difference of polarizability between these two internal states . finally , two experiments @xcite have measured the aharonov - casher phase @xcite : this phase , which results from the application of an electric field on an atom with an oriented magnetic moment , is proportional to the electric field .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly recall the principle of the experiment in part ii .",
    "we then describe our electric capacitor in part iii and the experiment in part iv .",
    "the analysis of the experimental data is done in part v and we discuss the polarizability result in part vi . a conclusion and two appendices complete the paper .",
    "if we apply an electric field @xmath14 on an atom , the energy of its ground state decreases by the polarizability term :    @xmath15    when an atom enters a region with a non vanishing electric field , its kinetic energy increases by @xmath16 and its wave vector @xmath17 becomes @xmath18 , with @xmath19 given by @xmath20 .",
    "the resulting phase shift @xmath21 of the atomic wave is given by :    @xmath22    where we have introduced the atom velocity @xmath23 and taken into account the spatial dependence of the electric field along the atomic path following the @xmath24-axis .",
    "this phase shift is inversely proportional to the atom velocity and this dependence will be included in our analysis of the results .",
    "the principle of the experiment , illustrated on figure [ interferometer ] , is to measure this phase shift by applying an electric field on one of the two interfering beams in an atom interferometer @xcite .",
    "this is possible only if the two beams are spatially separated so that a septum can be inserted between the two beams .",
    "this requirement could be suppressed by using an electric field with a gradient as in reference @xcite but it seems difficult to use this arrangement for a high accuracy measurement , because an accurate knowledge of the values of the field and of its gradient at the location of the atomic beams would be needed .",
    "to make an accurate measurement , we must know precisely the electric field along the atomic path and guard electrodes are needed so that the length of the capacitor is well defined , as discussed by d. pritchard and co - workers @xcite .",
    "it would probably be better to have guard electrodes on both electrodes , but it seems very difficult to draw guard electrodes on the septum and to put them in place very accurately .",
    "therefore , as in reference @xcite , we have guard electrodes only on the massive electrodes .",
    "however , we have chosen to put our guard electrodes in the plane of the high voltage electrode . with this choice",
    ", the calculation of the electric field can be done analytically .",
    "figure [ capacitor ] presents two schematic drawings of the capacitor and defines our notations , while an artist s view is presented in figure [ artistview ] .",
    "like in reference @xcite , our capacitor is as symmetric as possible with respect to the septum plane , but , for a given experiment , only one half of the capacitor is used , the other part creating no electric field with @xmath25 everywhere .",
    "if a dielectric slab with a permittivity @xmath26 is introduced in a plane capacitor , the field lines are distorted and concentrated towards the slab . because our capacitor contains dielectric spacers",
    ", one could fear a similar effect but this effect does not exist when the dielectric slab fills completely the gap between the electrodes . following figure [ capacitor ] , the spacers , with a dielectric constant @xmath27 completely fill the space @xmath28 , with vacuum in the rest of capacitor , @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 ( respectively @xmath31 ) be the potential with @xmath32 ( @xmath28 ) . in the @xmath33 planes , the continuity equations give :",
    "@xmath34    as shown below , a * 2d * solution of the laplace equation of the form @xmath35 exists for the capacitor .",
    "then clearly , if we take @xmath36 , this solution fulfills both continuity equations on the dielectric borders in the @xmath33 planes and we know that the solution is unique .",
    "we consider only one half ( with @xmath37 ) of the capacitor represented on figure [ capacitor ] .",
    "we know the potential on the borders of the capacitor , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 if @xmath40 and @xmath41 if @xmath42 .",
    "to get the potential everywhere , we start by calculating the fourier transform @xmath43 of @xmath44 :    @xmath45    then , for a separable harmonic function of @xmath46 and @xmath24 , with a @xmath24-dependence of the @xmath47 form , its @xmath46-dependence is necessarily given by a linear combination of the two functions @xmath48 .",
    "using this result and the conditions on the borders at @xmath49 and at @xmath50 , we get the value of @xmath35 everywhere :    @xmath51    from which we can deduce the electric field everywhere . on the septum surface @xmath52 , the electric field is parallel to the @xmath46-axis and we can calculate exactly the integral of @xmath53 on this surface ( see appendix a ) .",
    "we need the capacitor effective length @xmath54 which is defined by :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the electric field of an infinite plane capacitor with the same electrode spacing @xmath57 . using equation ( [ a51 ] ) , we get the exact value of @xmath54 :    @xmath58   \\approx   2a - \\frac{2h}{\\pi}\\ ] ]    where exponentially small corrections of the order of @xmath59 $ ] have been neglected in the approximate result .    however , the atoms do not sample the electric field on the septum surface but at a small distance , of the order of @xmath60 @xmath61 m in our experiment , and what we need is the integral of @xmath53 along their mean trajectory .",
    "this mean trajectory is not exactly parallel to the septum , but it is easier to calculate the integral along a constant @xmath46 line .",
    "we may use either the potential given by equation ( [ n5 ] ) or maxwell s equations to relate the field components near the septum surface to its value on the surface .",
    "the calculation , given in appendix a , proves that the first correction to the effective length is proportional to @xmath62 :    @xmath63    the @xmath62 correction is a fraction of the main term @xmath64 equal to @xmath65 and with our dimensions ( @xmath66 @xmath61 m , @xmath67 mm and @xmath68 mm ) , this correction is close to @xmath69 .",
    "this correction is negligible at the present level of accuracy and we will use the value of @xmath54 given by the approximate form of equation ( [ n91 ] ) . more precisely , we will write :    @xmath70\\ ] ]      let us describe how we build this capacitor .",
    "the external electrodes are made of glass plates ( @xmath71 mm long in the @xmath24 direction , @xmath72 mm high in the @xmath73 direction , @xmath74 mm thick in the @xmath46 direction ) covered by an evaporated aluminium layer . to separate the guard electrodes from the high voltage electrode ,",
    "a gap is made in the aluminium layer by laser evaporation @xcite .",
    "we found that @xmath75 @xmath61 m wide gaps give a sufficient insulation under vacuum to operate the capacitor up to @xmath76 v. these gaps are separated by a distance @xmath77 mm , so that the two guard electrodes are @xmath78 mm long .",
    "the glass spacers are @xmath79 mm thick plates of float glass ( @xmath74 mm @xmath80 @xmath71 mm ) used without further polishing .",
    "the distance @xmath81 from the spacer inner edge to the atomic beam axis is equal to @xmath82 mm .",
    "we have found that a float glass plate is flat within @xmath83 @xmath61 m over the needed surface .",
    "this accuracy appeared to be sufficient for a first construction , as the main geometrical defects are due to the way we assemble the various parts by gluing them together and by an imperfect stretching of the septum .",
    "we use a double - faced tape arclad 7418 ( from adhesive research ) to assemble the spacers on the external electrodes .",
    "the septum is made of @xmath84 @xmath61 m thick mylar from goodfellow covered with aluminium on both faces . in a first step , the mylar sheet is glued on circular metal support .",
    "it is then covered by a thin layer of dish soap diluted in water and the mylar is heated near @xmath85c with a hot air gun .",
    "then , we clean the mylar surface with water and let it dry .",
    "after this operation , the mylar is well stretched and its surface is very flat . we have measured the resonance frequencies of the drum thus formed , from which we deduced a surface tension of the order of @xmath60 n / m ( this value is only indicative as this experiment was made with another mylar film which was @xmath86 @xmath61 m thick ) . once stretched , the mylar film is glued on one electrode - spacer assembly with an epoxy glue epotek 301 ( from epoxy technology ) , chosen for its very low viscosity , and then it is cut with a scalpel . in a final step ,",
    "a second electrode - spacer assembly is glued on the other face of the mylar . finally ,",
    "as shown in figure [ artistview ] , wires are connected to the various electrodes using an electrically conductive adhesive epotek ee129 - 4 ( also from epoxy technology ) .",
    "we are going to discuss the various points by which the real capacitor differs from our model .",
    "we have shown that the potential @xmath30 is reduced to a * 2d * function when an homogeneous dielectric slab fills completely the gap between the electrodes , with the border between the vacuum and the slab being a plane perpendicular to the electrodes .",
    "the real dielectric slab is the superposition of a tape , a glass spacer and a glue film , each material having a different permittivity @xmath87 .",
    "the differences in permittivity perturb the potential which should take a * 3d * character extending on a distance comparable to the tape or glue film thicknesses .",
    "this perturbation seems negligible , because the tape and the glue films are very thin and also because these three dielectric materials have not very large @xmath87 values .",
    "our calculation assumes that the potential is known everywhere on the border .",
    "but , on the high - voltage electrode , we may fear that the potential is not well defined in the @xmath75 @xmath61 m wide dielectric gaps separating the high voltage and guard electrodes as these gaps might get charged in an uncontrolled way .",
    "this is not likely if the volume resistivity @xmath88 of the pyrex glass used is not too large : more precisely , the time constant for the charge equilibration on the gap surface is given by @xmath89 ( within numerical factors of the order of one ) and this time constant remains below @xmath90 second if @xmath91 @xmath92.m .",
    "we have found several values of the resistivity of pyrex glass at ordinary temperature , in the range @xmath93 @xmath92.m and with such a conductivity , this time constant is below @xmath94 s. our calculation neglects the surface conductivity , due to the adsorbed impurities , which should further reduce this time constant .",
    "therefore , we think that it is an excellent approximation to assume that the potential @xmath30 makes a smooth transition from @xmath25 to @xmath95 in the gaps . then , using equation ( [ a3 ] ) , it is clear that the detailed shape of the transition has no consequence as these details are smoothed out by the convolution of @xmath96 by the function @xmath97 which has a full width at half maximum equal to @xmath98 .",
    "we can use equation ( [ n91 ] ) to calculate the effective length , provided that we add to the length of the high voltage electrode the mean width of the two gaps . in the present work",
    ", we have taken one gap width , @xmath75 @xmath61 m , as a conservative error bar on the effective length .",
    "a superiority of our capacitor design is that these gaps are very narrow , thus minimizing the corresponding uncertainty on the capacitor effective length and we hope to be able to further reduce this uncertainty .",
    "the thickness @xmath57 of the capacitor , which is the sum of the thickness of the spacers , the tape and the glue film , is not perfectly constant . using a mitutoyo litematic machine ,",
    "we have measured , with a @xmath99 @xmath61 m uncertainty , the capacitor thickness as a function of @xmath24 , in the center line of the two spacers , at @xmath100 mm .",
    "the average of these two measurements gives the thickness @xmath101 in the @xmath102 plane around which the atom sample the electric field .",
    "the thickness @xmath57 is not perfectly constant but it is well represented by a linear function of @xmath24 , given by @xmath103 , the maximum deviation @xmath104 being considerably smaller than the mean @xmath57 value noted @xmath105 .",
    "as these deviations are very small ( see below ) , it seems reasonable to use use equation ( [ n14 ] ) provided that terms involving powers of @xmath57 are replaced by their correct averages .",
    "the first term in @xmath106 corresponds to the integral of @xmath53 over the capacitor length , from @xmath107 to @xmath108 and we must take the average value of @xmath106 over this region . neglecting higher order terms ,",
    "this average is given by : @xmath109\\ ] ]    in equation ( [ n14 ] ) , the second term in @xmath110 , corresponds to end effects and this quantity must be replaced by the following two - point average :    @xmath111\\ ] ]    both corrections involve the same factor @xmath112 $ ] .",
    "although the capacitor is as symmetric as possible , this symmetry is only approximate and we give the parameters for the half we have used for the set of measurements described below .",
    "the length of the high voltage electrode , including one gap width is @xmath113 mm , the error bar being taken equal to one gap width , as discussed above .",
    "the distance @xmath57 between the electrodes gap width is described by @xmath114 mm and @xmath115 mm .",
    "the correction term @xmath116 is completely negligible .",
    "in this part , we are going to recall the main features of our lithium atom interferometer , to give the values of various parameters used for the present study , to present the data acquisition procedure and the way we extract the phases from the data .",
    "our atom interferometer is a mach - zehnder interferometer using bragg diffraction on laser standing waves .",
    "its design is inspired by the sodium interferometer of d. pritchard and co - workers @xcite and by the metastable neon interferometer of siu au lee and co - workers @xcite .",
    "a complete description has been published @xcite .",
    "the lithium atomic beam is a supersonic beam seeded in argon and , for the present experiment , we have worked with a low argon pressure in the oven @xmath117 mbar , because the detected lithium signal increases when the argon pressure decreases .",
    "the oven body temperature is equal to @xmath118 k , fixing the vapor pressure of lithium at @xmath119 mbar and the nozzle temperature is equal to @xmath120 k. with these source conditions , following our detailed analysis @xcite , the argon and lithium velocity distributions are described by a parallel speed ratio for argon equal to @xmath121 and a parallel speed ratio for lithium equal to @xmath122 ( the parallel speed ratio is defined by equation ( [ m4 ] ) below ) .",
    "we use bragg diffraction on laser standing waves at @xmath123 nm : the laser is detuned by about @xmath124 ghz on the blue side of the @xmath125 - @xmath126 transition of the @xmath0li isotope , the signal is almost purely due to this isotope , which has a natural abundance equal to @xmath127% , and not to the other isotope @xmath128 .",
    "moreover , any other species present in the beam , for instance heavier alkali atoms or lithium dimers , is not diffracted and does not contribute to the signal .",
    "the case of lithium dimers deserves a special discussion because they are surely present in the beam and the lithium dimer has an absorption band system due its @xmath129 transition with many lines around @xmath130 nm : for most rovibrational levels of the @xmath131 state , the absorption transition which is closest to the laser frequency has a very large detuning of the order of hundreds to thousands of ghz and the intensity of this resonance transition is also weaker than the resonance transition of lithium atom , because of the franck - condon factor .",
    "therefore , the lithium dimers have a negligible probability of diffraction and do not contribute to the interferometer signals .",
    "the interference signals in a mach - zehnder interferometer are given by :    @xmath132\\ ] ]    where the phase @xmath133 of the interference fringes can be written : @xmath134    the first term of @xmath133 is particular to three - grating interferometers : the diffracted beam of order @xmath135 by grating @xmath136 has a phase dependent on the grating position @xmath137 . in our case of laser diffraction ,",
    "the grating position @xmath137 is given by the mirror position @xmath138 and @xmath139 is the grating wavevector , where @xmath140 is the laser wavevector .",
    "this phase term is very interesting because it is non dispersive and it is commonly used to observe interference fringes . in our case , we scan the position @xmath141 of mirror @xmath142 by a piezoelectric translation stage .",
    "the second term @xmath21 represent any phase difference between the two beams and in particular , it will represent the phase shift due to the application of an electric field on one of the two paths .      in the present work ,",
    "we have only used the diffraction order @xmath143 so that the center of the two beams are separated by about @xmath144 @xmath61 m at the location of the capacitor , which is located just before the second laser standing wave .",
    "the capacitor is attached to the top of the vacuum chamber and not to the rail supporting the laser standing wave mirrors @xmath138 : in this way , we do not increase the vibrations of the mirror positions @xmath137 the capacitor is held by a translation stage along the @xmath46-direction , which can be adjusted manually thanks to a vacuum feedthrough and a double stage kinematic mount built in our laboratory .",
    "the first stage , operated with screws , can be used only when the experiment is at atmospheric pressure while the second stage , actuated by low - voltage piezo - translators , can be adjusted under vacuum . when the septum is inserted between the two atomic paths ,",
    "the atom propagation is almost not affected by its presence and , as shown in figure [ fringes84 ] , we have observed a fringe visibility equal @xmath145 % and a negligible reduction of the atomic flux .    to optimize the phase sensitivity ( see a discussion in reference @xcite ) , we have opened the collimation slit @xmath146 and the detection slit @xmath147 ( see reference @xcite ) with widths @xmath148 @xmath61 m and @xmath149 @xmath61 m , thus increasing the mean flux up to @xmath150 counts / s and slightly reducing the fringe visibility down to @xmath151% ( see figure [ signals ] ) .",
    "we have made a series of recordings , labelled by an index @xmath136 from @xmath90 to @xmath152 , with @xmath153 when @xmath136 is odd , and with @xmath154 , when @xmath136 is even with @xmath155 volts .",
    "for each recording , we apply the same linear ramp on the piezo - drive of mirror @xmath142 in order to observe interference fringes and @xmath156 data points are recorded with a counting time per channel equal to @xmath157 s. figure [ signals ] presents a pair of consecutive recordings .",
    "the high voltage power supply has stability close to @xmath158 and the applied voltage is measured by a hp model @xmath159 voltmeter with a relative accuracy better than @xmath160 .      for each recording ,",
    "the data points @xmath161 have been fitted by a function :    @xmath162 \\nonumber \\\\",

    "have been adjusted as well as the mean intensity @xmath167 and the visibility @xmath168 . for the @xmath169 recording ,",
    "we have fitted only @xmath164 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , while fixing @xmath165 and @xmath166 to their value @xmath170 and @xmath171 from the previous @xmath25 recording .",
    "we think that our best phase measurements are given by the mean phase @xmath172 obtained by averaging @xmath173 over the @xmath156 channels .",
    "the @xmath174 error bar of these mean phases are of the order of @xmath175 mrad , increasing with the applied voltage up to @xmath176 mrad because the visibility is considerably lower when the applied voltage @xmath177 is large ( see figure [ visibility ] ) .",
    "this rapid decrease of the visibility is due to the velocity dependence of the phase and to the velocity distribution of the lithium atoms .",
    "the mean phase values @xmath172 values of the @xmath153 recordings are plotted in figure [ phasezero ] : they present a drift equal to @xmath178 mrad / minute and some scatter around this regular drift .",
    "the most natural explanation for this drift is a change of the phase @xmath133 resulting from a variation of the mirror positions @xmath137 : @xmath133 changes by @xmath90 radian for a variation of @xmath179 equal to @xmath180 nm .",
    "we have verified that the observed drift has the right order of magnitude to be due to the differential thermal expansion of the structure supporting the three mirrors : its temperature was steadily drifting at @xmath181 k / minute during the experiment and the support of mirror @xmath142 differs from the other supports , as it includes a piezo translation stage , which is replaced by aluminium alloy for the mirrors @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "presently , we have no explanation of the phase scatter , which presents a quasi - periodic structure as a function of time : its rms value is equal to @xmath184 milliradian and , unfortunately , this scatter gives the dominant contribution to our phase uncertainty .",
    "the phase shift @xmath185 due to the polarizability effect ( the average @xmath186 recalls that our experiment makes an average over the velocity distribution , as discussed below ) is taken equal to @xmath187 where the recording @xmath136 corresponds to the applied voltage @xmath177 : the average of the mean phase of the two @xmath153 recordings done just before and after is our best estimator of the mean phase of the interference signal in zero field . in figure",
    "[ phaseshifts ] , we have plotted the phase shift @xmath188 as a function of the applied voltage @xmath177 .",
    "we have chosen for the error bar on @xmath188 the quadratic sum of the @xmath174 error bar given by the fit of @xmath189 and the @xmath184 milliradians rms deviation of the @xmath153 phase measurements .",
    "to interpret the experimental data , we must take into account the velocity distribution of the lithium atoms .",
    "we assume that this velocity distribution is given by :    @xmath190\\ ] ]    where @xmath191 is the most probable velocity and @xmath192 is the parallel speed ratio .",
    "with respect to the usual form of the velocity distribution for supersonic beams , we have omitted a @xmath193 factor which is traditionally introduced @xcite but when the parallel speed ratio @xmath192 is large enough , this @xmath193 has little effect and the main consequence of its omission is a slight modification of the values of @xmath191 and @xmath192 . here , what we consider is the atoms contributing to the interferometer signal and their velocity distribution may differ slightly from the velocity of the incident beam , as bragg diffraction is velocity selective . the experimental signal can be written :    @xmath194 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & i_0   \\left[1 + \\left<{\\mathcal{v}}\\right > \\cos\\left ( \\psi + \\left<\\phi\\right > \\right ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath195 is the value of the phase @xmath196 for the velocity @xmath197 . if we introduce @xmath198 and expand @xmath199 in powers of @xmath200 up to second order , the integral can be taken exactly , as discussed in appendix b. however , the accuracy of this approximation is not good enough when @xmath201 is large and we have used direct numerical integration to fit our data .",
    "using equations ( [ m4 ] ) and ( [ m5 ] ) , we have fitted the measured phase @xmath196 and visibility @xmath202 as a function of the applied voltage @xmath30 .",
    "the phase measurements received a weight inversely proportional to the square of their estimated uncertainty and we have adjusted two parameters , the value of @xmath203 and the parallel speed ratio @xmath192 .",
    "the results of the fits are presented in figures [ phaseshifts ] and [ visibility ] .",
    "the agreement is excellent , in particular for the phase data , and we deduce a very accurate value of @xmath204 :    @xmath205    where the error bar is equal to @xmath174 .",
    "the relative uncertainty on @xmath206 is very small , @xmath207% , which proves the quality of our phase measurements .",
    "we also get an accurate determination of the parallel speed ratio :    @xmath208    this value of the parallel speed ratio is larger than the predicted value for our lithium beam , @xmath209 ( see above ) and this difference can be explained by the velocity selective character of bragg diffraction .",
    "the lithium electric polarizability is related to the value of @xmath210 by :    @xmath211 \\left[1 + \\frac{h_1 ^ 2}{h_0 ^ 2}\\right]\\ ] ]    all the geometrical parameters @xmath212 , @xmath105 and @xmath104 describing the capacitor are known with a good accuracy and we deduce a still very accurate value of the ratio of the electric polarizability @xmath10 divided by the mean atom velocity @xmath191 :    @xmath213      we have measured the mean atom velocity @xmath191 by various techniques    we have made measurements by doppler effect , measured either on the laser induced fluorescence signals or on the intensity of the atomic beam which is reduced by atomic deflection due to photon recoil . in the first case , the laser was making an angle close to @xmath214 with the atomic beam and it is difficult to measure this angle with sufficient accuracy .    in the second case , we have used a laser beam almost contra - propagating with the atoms , so that the uncertainty on the cosine of the angle is negligible .",
    "the signal appears as an intensity loss on the atomic beam and , the loss is not very large because we have used only one laser , so that the atoms are rapidly pumped in the other hyperfine state . the experimental signal is shown in figure [ atomrecoil ] . from a fit of this data",

    "many calculations of @xmath10 have been published and one can find a very complete review with 35 quotations in table 17 of the paper of king @xcite published in 1997 . here is a very brief discussion of the most important results :    * the first calculation of @xmath10 was made in 1959 by dalgarno and kingston @xcite and gave @xmath246 a.u .. this calculation was rapidly followed by several other works . * if we forget hartree - fock results near @xmath247 a.u .",
    ", a large majority of the published values are in the @xmath248 a.u . range . * in 1994 , kassimi and thakkar @xcite have made a detailed study with two important results .",
    "they obtained a fully converged hartree - fock value , @xmath249 a.u . and",
    "this result , far from the experimental values , proves the importance of electron correlation .",
    "they also made a series of nth - order mller - plesset calculations with @xmath250 , @xmath124 and @xmath251 , from which they extract their best estimate with an error bar , @xmath252 a.u .. * in 1996 , yan et al .",
    "@xcite have made an hylleraas calculation , with the final value @xmath253 a.u .",
    ", this value and its error bar resulting from a convergence study .",
    "our result is extremely close to these two very accurate calculations of @xmath10 .",
    "two minor effects have not been taken into account in these calculations , namely relativistic correction and finite nuclear mass correction , but these two effects are quite small .",
    "the relativistic correction on the polarizability has been studied by lim et al .",
    "they have made different calculations ( hartree - fock , second order mller - plesset , coupled cluster ccsd and ccsd(t ) ) and in all cases , their relativistic result is lower than the non - relativistic result with a difference in the @xmath254 a.u . range .",
    "we do not quote here their results : even the hartree - fock value is lower by @xmath255 a.u .",
    "than the one of reference @xcite , because the chosen basis set is too small .",
    "as far as we know , no calculation of @xmath10 has been made taking into account the finite nuclear mass .",
    "an order of magnitude of the associated correction should be given by the hydrogenic approximation : @xmath256 ^ 3 $ ] and in this approximation , the polarisability of @xmath0li should be larger than its @xmath257 value by @xmath258 a.u .",
    "but one should not expect this approximation to predict even the sign of the correction .",
    "a high accuracy calculation of the finite mass effect is surely feasible , following the hylleraas calculations of yan and drake , who have already evaluated the finite mass effect on some energies @xcite and oscillator strengths @xcite of lithium atom .",
    "we have made a measurement of the electric polarizability of lithium atom @xmath0li by atom interferometry and we have obtained @xmath259 a.u . with a @xmath4% uncertainty .",
    "our measurement is in excellent agreement with the most accurate experimental value obtained by bederson and coworkers @xcite in 1974 and we have reduced the uncertainty by a factor three .",
    "our result is also in excellent agreement with the best theoretical estimates of this quantity due to kassimi and thakkar @xcite and to yan et al . @xcite .",
    "the neglected corrections ( relativistic effect , finite nuclear mass effect ) should be at least ten times smaller than our present error bar .",
    "our measurement is the second measurement of an electric polarizability by atom interferometry , the previous experiment being done on sodium atom by d. pritchard and co - workers @xcite in 1995 ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this long delay is explained by the difficulty of running an atom interferometer with spatially separated beams . using a similar experiment , j. p. toennies and co -",
    "workers have compared the polarizabilities of helium atom and helium dimer but this work is still unpublished @xcite .",
    "we want now to insist on the improvements we have done with respect to the other measurement of an electric polarizability by atom interferometry , due to d. pritchard and co - workers @xcite :    * the design of our capacitor permits an analytical calculation of the @xmath53 integral along the atomic path .",
    "this property is important for a better understanding of the influence of small geometrical defects of the real capacitor . in the present experiment ,",
    "the uncertainty on the @xmath53 integral is equal to @xmath157% and we think that it is possible to reduce this uncertainty near @xmath260 % with an improved construction . * we have obtained a very good phase sensitivity of our atom interferometer : from our recordings , we estimate this phase sensitivity near @xmath5 mrad/@xmath6 .",
    "the accuracy achieved on phase measurement has been limited by the lack of reproducibility of the phase between consecutive recordings .",
    "we will stabilize the temperature of the rail supporting the three mirrors , hoping thus to improve the phase stability .",
    "even if we have not been able to fully use our phase sensitivity , we have obtained set of phase - shifts measurements exhibiting an excellent consistency and accuracy , as shown by the quality of the fit of figure [ phaseshifts ] and by the accuracy , @xmath261% , of the measurement of the quantity @xmath262 . * in his thesis @xcite , t. d. roberts reanalyzes the measurement of the electric polarizability of sodium atom made by c. r. ekstrom et al .",
    "@xcite : he estimates that a weak contribution of sodium dimers to the interference signals can be present as material gratings diffract sodium dimers as well as sodium atoms and he estimates that , in the worst case , this molecular signal might have introduced a systematic error as large as @xmath263% on the sodium polarizability result .",
    "our interferometer is species selective thanks to the use of laser diffraction and this type of error does not exist in our experiment .",
    "only lithium atoms are diffracted and even , with our choice of laser wavelength , only the @xmath0li isotope contributes to the signal .",
    "the main limitation on the present measurement of the electric polarisability of lithium @xmath0li comes from the uncertainty on the most probable atom velocity @xmath191 . with some exceptions , like the aharonov - casher phase shift @xcite which is independent of the atom velocity ,",
    "a phase - shift induced by a perturbation is inversely proportional to the atom velocity , at least when a static perturbation is applied on one interfering beam .",
    "this is a fundamental property of atom interferometry and clever techniques are needed to overcome this difficulty :    * t. d. roberts et al .",
    "@xcite have developed a way of correcting the velocity dependence of the phase shift by adding another phase shift with an opposite velocity dependence .",
    "they were thus able to observe fringes with a good visibility up to very large phase shift values . *",
    "our present results prove that a very accurate measurement can be made in the presence of an important velocity dispersion without any compensation of the associated phase dispersion , but by taking into account the velocity distribution in the data analysis .    in these two cases",
    ", one must know very accurately a velocity , the most probable velocity in our case and the velocity for which the correction phase cancels in the case of reference @xcite",
    ". the uncertainty on this velocity may finally be the limiting factor for high precision measurements .",
    "obviously other techniques can be used to solve this difficulty .",
    "finally , we think that our experiment illustrates well two very important properties of atom interferometry :    * the sensitivity of atom interferometry is a natural consequence of the well - known sensitivity of interferometry in general , which is further enhanced in the case of atom by the extremely small value of the de broglie wavelength .",
    "our phase measurement is in fact a direct mesaurement of the increase @xmath7 of the atom velocity @xmath8 when entering the electric field .",
    "@xmath7 is very simply related to the observed phase shift : + @xmath264 + this variation is extremely small , with @xmath265 for the largest electric field used in this experiment , corresponding to @xmath266 rad .",
    "our ultimate sensitivity corresponds to a phase @xmath267 milliradian which means that we can detect a variation @xmath9 , whereas the velocity distribution has a fwhm width equal to @xmath268% ! * when an atom propagates in the capacitor placed in our atom interferometer , its wavefunction samples two regions of space separated by a distance @xmath269 @xmath61 m with a macroscopic object , the septum , lying in between and this situation extends over @xmath270 microsecond duration , without inducing any loss of coherence .",
    "this consequence of quantum mechanics remains very fascinating !",
    "we thank cnrs spm and rgion midi pyrnes for financial support .",
    "we thank p. a. skovorodko and j. l. heully for helpful information .",
    "the first step is to calculate the fourier transform @xmath43 of @xmath271 defined by equation ( [ n4 ] ) :    @xmath272    the potential @xmath35 given by equation ( [ n5 ] ) can then be calculated and , from @xmath35 , we can deduce the electric field everywhere and in particular , on the septum surface where it is parallel to the @xmath46-axis :    @xmath273    with @xmath274 .",
    "the electric field @xmath275 is given by the inverse fourier transform of the product of two functions @xmath43 and @xmath276 .",
    "therefore , the field @xmath277 is the convolution of their inverse fourier transforms which are @xmath44 and @xmath97 :    @xmath278    using reference @xcite ( equation 6 of paragraph 4.111 , p. 511 ) , we get an explicit form of @xmath97 :    @xmath279    this result proves that the field decreases asymptotically like @xmath280 , when @xmath281 .",
    "we can also get a closed form expression of the electric field @xmath277 but we may get the integral of @xmath53 without this result , simply by using the parseval - plancherel theorem and reference @xcite ( equation 4 of paragraph 3.986 , p. 506 ) :    @xmath282\\ ] ]    the atoms sample the electric field at a small distance of the septum surface and we need the integral of @xmath53 along their mean trajectory .",
