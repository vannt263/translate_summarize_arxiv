    "globular cluster ( gc ) systems contain important clues about the assembly history of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "their kinematics are especially important as different formation channels lead to distinct predictions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , gc kinematics can also be used to model the shape of the gravitational potential and constrain the total mass of the host galaxy ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    located at a distance of @xmath3780  kpc @xcite , the local group galaxy m31 provides an excellent opportunity to study a rich gc system in unparalleled detail .",
    "it has more than 500 confirmed members listed in the revised bologna catalogue ( rbc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most of which lie within a projected radius ( @xmath4 ) of 30  kpc . in recent years ,",
    "state - of - the - art wide field surveys ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have enabled searches for gcs in m31 s far outer halo .",
    "this has led to the discovery of over 90 new halo gcs , extending to @xmath4  @xmath5  kpc and 3d radii of @xmath6200  kpc ( e.g , huxor et al . 2005 ; huxor et al .",
    "2008 ; huxor et al 2013 , di tullio zinn & zinn 2013 ) .",
    "a major step forward in understanding the formation of the outer halo gc system came from the realisation that these objects preferentially lie on stellar streams and other debris features @xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulations indicate a probability of @xmath7 that such alignments should happen by chance , leading to the conclusion that 80% of the m31 outer halo gcs have been accreted along with their host galaxies , confirming the idea put forward by @xcite for the milky way . in this letter",
    ", we present the first results of a spectroscopic survey of these outer halo objects , focusing on their global kinematics .",
    "a detailed description of the data as well as a full analysis is deferred for a later publication ( veljanoski et al . in prep ) .",
    "spectra were acquired for 53 gcs spanning @xmath4  @xmath8  kpc , of which 12(6 ) lie beyond @xmath9  kpc .",
    "this sample is complete down to @xmath10 , and 44 of the clusters had not previously been observed spectroscopically .",
    "the data were obtained over 15 nights during 2005 - 2010 using the isis spectrograph on the wht 4.2 m , and the rc spectrograph on the kpno 4 m .",
    "isis has two detectors that independently sample the blue and red spectral range .",
    "we used the r600b and r600r gratings to cover the wavelength range @xmath11  nm with a dispersion of 0.045  nm / pixel and @xmath12  nm with a dispersion of 0.079  nm / pixel respectively . with the rc spectrograph",
    ", we used the kpc007 grating with a wavelength coverage of @xmath13  nm and a dispersion of 0.139  nm / pixel .",
    "total integrations were 600 - 7200 seconds depending on the target brightness .",
    "the slit width was 1 - 2@xmath14 .",
    "the signal - to - noise per pixel was @xmath15 for most targets and 50 - 70 for the brightest objects .",
    "the data were reduced using standard iraf procedures .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were extracted with aperture radii of 2 - 2.5@xmath14 .",
    "heliocentric radial velocities were derived using a chi - squared minimization technique between gc spectra and radial velocity template stars ( veljanoski et al .",
    "2013 , in prep ) .",
    "this is analogous to the standard cross - correlation method , and it produces similar results .",
    "the method has the advantage that it uses the uncertainties in both the target and template spectra , which helps to eliminate spurious features in the chi - squared function .    the uncertainty in the radial velocity of each cluster is adopted to be the standard deviation of all the independent chi - squared minimizations between the cluster and multiple radial velocity standard stars .",
    "furthermore , as we obtained two independent velocity measurements for the gcs observed with isis , these were combined to reduce the uncertainty in the final velocity value .",
    "the final median uncertainty of all 53 gc velocity measurements is 12  km / s . of the 9 gcs in our sample that had published velocities in the rbc ,",
    "all agree to within one standard deviation .",
    "four of these clusters were found to have more precise rbc velocities compared to our measurements and for these we adopt the rbc values in our subsequent analysis .",
    "as our gc sample spans a large extent on the sky , we converted our heliocentric radial velocities to the galactocentric frame in order to remove any effects the solar motion could have on the kinematics .",
    "this conversion was done using the relations presented in @xcite , with updated values for the solar motion from @xcite and @xcite . for the purpose of this study ,",
    "we take the m31 heliocentric velocity to be -301 4  km / s @xcite , which translates to a galactocentric radial velocity of -109 4  km / s .",

    "are the positions of the observed gcs , the colors of which correspond to their measured galactocentric radial velocities .",
    "three interesting groups of gcs are indicated on figure [ fig : velmap ] .",
    "the blue rectangle marks 4 gcs that project on the north - west stream .",
    "a contiguous velocity gradient is seen along this feature , with the most radially - distant cluster ( @xmath4  @xmath17125  kpc ) having a velocity of @xmath18  km / s and the innermost object ( @xmath4  @xmath1767  kpc ) having @xmath19  km / s",
    ". also marked ( red contour ) are the gcs that lie on stream d , a feature first identified by @xcite .",
    "there is no apparent velocity gradient in this case , but the velocities of the gcs observed in the northeastern part of the stream suggest two distinct kinematic groups .",
    "in particular , 4 gcs have a mean velocity and dispersion of @xmath20  km / s and 50  km / s , while the remaining 3 gcs have mean velocity and dispersion of 71  km / s and 18  km / s .",
    "interestingly , the northeastern part of stream d has been previously identified to be a complicated region where it overlaps stream c @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems likely that the two kinematic gc groups we have identified are associated with these different streams , and are moving in the opposite sense around m31 , as judged by their mean velocities .",
    "radial velocities for stream stars in this overlapping region are not yet available , but the lone southern gc on stream d has a radial velocity that lies within @xmath21  km / s of stream stars tentatively identified in a nearby field @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the and - i dwarf , located on the south end of stream d , has a galactocentric velocity of @xmath3 - 190  km / s , similar to one of the kinematic gc groups .",
    "the and - ix dwarf , located on the north end of stream d with velocity of @xmath3 - 20km / s , appears uncorrelated with the gc groups .",
    "the yellow region on figure [ fig : velmap ] marks `` association 2 '' which @xcite identified as a statistical overdensity of gcs not associated with any obvious underlying stellar debris feature .",
    "the spread of velocities indicates that not all of the gcs in this region can be members of a kinematically coherent subgroup .",
    "however , measurements for the remaining @xmath360% of the putative `` association 2 '' gcs are required before the presence of a subgroup can be definitely ruled out .",
    "it has been known for some time that gcs in the inner regions of m31 rotate around the minor optical axis of the galaxy , in the same sense as the disk rotation . @xcite",
    "measured a rotational amplitude of the gc system of @xmath5  km / s , while @xcite measured @xmath22  km / s using a larger sample .",
    "dividing the gcs based on their metalliticy , @xcite found more pronounced rotation for the metal - rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath23 - 1 ) subpopulation .",
    "inspection of figure [ fig : velmap ] strongly suggests this rotation persists to larger radii , with gcs in the northeast having systematically higher velocities than those in the southwest .",
    "figure [ fig : rot ] shows the galactocentric radial velocities , corrected for the systemic motion of m31 , versus their projected distances along the m31 major axis .",
    "gcs belonging to the subgroups identified in figure [ fig : velmap ] are color - coded .",
    "the rotational signature appears to be a property of the bulk population of the outer halo gc sample and is not driven by one or two kinematically - coherent subgroups .    to further investigate the rotational signature , we follow @xcite and fit the observed projected galactocentric radial velocities @xmath24 of the gcs with the function ,    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the projected position angle , measured east of north , of a cluster relative to m31 center",
    ", @xmath27 is the projected position angle of the gc system rotation axis , @xmath28 is the systemic velocity of the gc system and @xmath29 is the amplitude of rotation .",
    "this approach assumes that the rotation axis of the gc system is perpendicular to the line of sight , and that the intrinsic angular velocity of the system is constant on spherical surfaces .",
    "the uncertainties are determined using the numerical bootstrapping technique @xcite and the derived rotational amplitudes are corrected for the inclination of the m31 disk , taken to be 77.5 @xcite .",
    "we augment our radial velocities with those from the rbc and fit the gc sample as a whole as well as within and beyond 30 kpc .",
    "this radius corresponds to a clear break in the gc radial number density profile @xcite and therefore provides a natural division between the `` inner '' and  outer \" halo . for reference ,",

    "the results remain unchanged when @xmath28 in equation [ eq : rot ] is left to vary as a free parameter , or when the mean velocity of the gc system is used .",
    "given the position angle of the m31 major axis is 38 , the derived rotation axis is consistent with the minor axis of m31 , and is essentially indistinguishable from the rotation axis of the inner halo gcs .    .",

    "it reveals a decreasing velocity dispersion with increasing distance from the m31 center , varying from @xmath32  km / s at 60  kpc to @xmath33  km / s at 120  kpc . for reference ,",
    "the metal - poor field star velocity dispersion is @xmath398  km / s at 60  kpc ( measured ) , and @xmath344  km / s at 120  kpc ( extrapolated ) @xcite .    from the m31 center .",

    "the open squares correspond to the mean velocities of the halo clusters in 20  kpc bins .",

    "the dotted line marks the 30 kpc radius.,width=325 ]      assuming the halo gc system is spherically symmetric , we can estimate the mass of m31 by solving the jeans equation @xcite . because we have found evidence for rotation in the m31 halo gc system , the jeans equation is separated into a rotating and a non - rotating component .",
    "the total mass is obtained by summing the mass supported by pressure @xmath34 and the rotationally - supported mass @xmath35 .",
    "the rotational component is determined via :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the projected radius of the outermost gc in our sample , @xmath38 is the rotational amplitude of the outer gc population and @xmath39 is the gravitational constant .    to determine @xmath40 we use the solution of the non - rotating jeans equation proposed by @xcite , known as the tracer mass estimator ( tme ) :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the projected radius from the center of m31 for a given cluster , @xmath43 is the radial velocity of the gc with the rotational component removed and @xmath44 is the total number of clusters in our sample .",
    "the constant @xmath45 depends on the shape of the potential , the radial distribution of the tracer objects and the anisotropy in the system . for a spherical , isotropic system",
    ", it has the following form :    @xmath46    in equation ( [ eq : c ] ) , @xmath47 and @xmath48 correspond to the smallest and largest 3d radii of the halo gcs respectively . in this case",
    ", we assume @xmath49 kpc , while @xmath48 is set to 200 kpc assuming mgc1 is the most remote gc @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath50 is related to the underlying gravitational field , which is assumed to be scale - free , at least between @xmath47 and @xmath48 . for an isothermal halo potential where the system has a flat rotation curve at large radii ,",
    "@xmath50 is zero .",
    "if we assume a nfw dark matter profile @xcite , @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath52 parameter is the slope of the gc volume density distribution .",
    "we calculate this using the surface density distribution of all 84 gcs that have projected radii larger than 30 kpc ( huxor et al .",
    "2013 , in prep ; mackey et al .",
    "2013 , in prep ) and find @xmath53 .",
    "it is also important to note that even though the tme uses a gc sample in a shell around the center of m31 , it calculates the total mass enclosed by the furthest cluster in that sample .    using the above method , and setting @xmath50 to zero",
    ", we calculate the total mass of m31 to be @xmath54 , where the pressure component is @xmath55 and the rotation contribution is @xmath56 . assuming @xmath57 , we find the m31 mass to be @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "for reference , applying the tme in a single step ( ignoring rotation ) , gives @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath50 values of 0 and 0.55 respectively .",
    "the quoted errors incorporate the statistical uncertainties only , and in reality they are much larger . in our mass calculations ,",
    "we assume isotropic orbits , a steady state for our tracer population and a power - law form for the potential .",
    "this is the simplest approach we can take , although the presence of the substructure in the spatial distribution of the outer halo gcs suggests that it may not be correct .",
    "nonetheless , studies suggest the presence of substructure in the tracer population will bias results only at the 20% level ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to explicitly test the assumption of steady state , we recalculate the m31 mass excluding gcs which lie along the north - west stream and stream d. we find the total mass of m31 decreases by @xmath63 for both values of @xmath50 , with the formal statistical errors remaining unchanged .",
    "analysis of the radial velocities of m31 outer halo gcs strongly supports our earlier finding that many of these objects have been accreted @xcite .",
    "clear kinematic correlations are seen amongst subgroups of gcs which lie on top of stellar debris features , and , in the case of the north - west stream , an unambiguous signature of radial infall is observed .",
    "interestingly , recent work has also began to detect phase - space substructure in large samples of gcs around distant galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however it is only within the local group that we can attempt the obvious next step of comparing gc velocities with those of underlying stream stars .",
    "a surprising discovery is the high degree of rotation in the m31 outer halo gc population , which is in the same sense as the inner halo population as well as the main stellar disk . while it is common to find gcs rapidly rotating in inner regions of galaxies , strong rotation beyond a few tens of kpc seems to be a rare occurrence , at least amongst early type galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is natural to speculate on how such coherent motion could arise if the outer gc population were largely accreted from numerous dwarf galaxy hosts .",
    "one possibility is that the donor dwarf galaxies have been accreted from a few preferred directions on the sky and hence have aligned angular momenta , as seen in some recent cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "such a scenario has also been suggested as the origin of the planar alignments of dwarf galaxies seen in both the milky way and m31 ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "curiously , the plane of dwarf galaxies reported in m31 rotates in the same sense as the outer halo gc population , although the rotation axis of that plane appears to be inclined by @xmath64 to the minor axis .",
    "it is also possible that the bulk of the m31 outer halo gc population was accreted in a single event involving a moderate mass satellite .",
    "support for this idea could come from the m31 thick disk which rotates in the same sense , albeit somewhat faster , than the halo gc population @xcite .",
    "however , a rather massive satellite would be required to bring in a population of several tens of gcs , raising the question of how the m31 disk could survive such an encounter .",
    "furthermore , it would seem difficult to explain the spatial correlation between outer halo gcs and the numerous tidal streams in this case . in a different scenario ,",
    "numerical modelling @xcite suggests that a past major merger between m31 and another disk galaxy could give rise to the rapid rotation of the resulting gc system , including the rotation in the halo population .    despite being our closest massive galaxy ,",
    "it is remarkable that we are still unable to measure the total mass of m31 with good precision .",
    "indeed , there is still debate as to whether m31 or the milky way is more massive @xcite .",
    "@xcite used gc kinematics to find a m31 mass of @xmath65 out to a deprojected 3d distance of @xmath3100 kpc , while @xcite and @xcite used expanded samples to calculate masses of @xmath66 within the same radial range .",
    "several authors have attempted to determine the m31 mass via the motions of its dwarf satellite galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most recent such measurement is presented by @xcite who estimated @xmath67 using 23 satellites out to 300 kpc , assuming isotropy .",
    "our estimate of @xmath68 within a 3d radius of 200 kpc agrees well with this value but suffers from the similar systematic uncertainties due to model assumptions .",
    "notably , @xcite use the velocity vector of m31 with respect to the milky way in combination with the timing argument to derive a total mass for the local group @xmath69 , which would push the m31 mass higher than any estimate thus far using dynamical tracers .",
