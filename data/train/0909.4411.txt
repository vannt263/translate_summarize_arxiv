    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences of a quantum filed theory are related to the short distance behaviour of the vacuum expectation values of product of the field operators . in case of the free scalar field in minkowski background ,",
    "the correlator is given by @xmath4 in the limit @xmath5 the correlator diverges leading to the bad uv behaviour .",
    "the one possible way to remove uv divergences is to introduce a cut - off on some sufficiently high energy scales . in this approach momentum integrations",
    "have to be limited to the scale of cut - off @xmath6 .",
    "then field theoretical description of the field is effective and valid up to the scale of cut - off @xmath6 , where a new physical description has to be introduced .",
    "another way to introduce cut - off is to perform averaging of the field on the sufficiently small distances .",
    "then we introduce a new field @xmath7 which is averaged version of the field @xmath8 with some averaging function @xmath9 which fulfils the normalisation condition @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath11 is determinant of the spatial part of the metric . in our considerations",
    "we take the frw metric , then @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the scale factor .",
    "it turns out that vacuum expectation values of product of the new fields @xmath7 becomes finite for @xmath5 . therefore the uv divergence is removed . in the model considered in this paper",
    "we assume smoothing gaussian function in the form @xmath14 the parameter of this function is dispersion @xmath15 , which is the scale of smoothing .",
    "all the structures of the field below the scale @xmath15 are smoothed out .",
    "it is worth to stress that the smoothing is over the fixed physical distance .",
    "therefore we have introduced the factor @xmath16 in formula ( [ gauss ] ) .",
    "the scale of smoothing can be related either with the properties of the field or with the properties of the space .",
    "namely , it can be for example a scale where the structure of a field becomes polymerised , as in the case studied in @xcite",
    ". then effective field theoretical description is valid only at the scales larger than @xmath15 .",
    "another source of smoothing can be the discrete nature of space . in this case",
    "averaging has to be performed on the scales where the quantum gravitational effects becomes significant , namely on the planck scale .",
    "subsequent possible source of smoothing is decoherence of the quantum fluctuations @xcite . in this case",
    "the parameter @xmath15 encodes the details of interaction between the quantum fluctuations and the environment .",
    "process of diffusion is also the natural smoothing factor .    in this paper",
    "we study how the effect of smoothing modify the power spectrum of the scalar field . in our consideration",
    "we apply the smoothing to the quantum fluctuations generated during the phase of inflation . in particular we show how power spectrum from de sitter inflation is regularised by the smoothing .",
    "then we investigate possible observational consequences of this effect .",
    "now we will derive the spectrum of the scalar field in the flat frw background in presence of smoothing .",
    "we will consider classical scalar field now , but the results obtained are the same like in the quantum case . the quantum case is discussed in more details in appendix where also an example of the smoothed free scalar field in the minkowski background is shown .    the scalar field @xmath17 can be smoothed by performing the integration @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the shooting function .",
    "taking the fourier transform of equation ( [ conv ] ) we obtain @xmath20 where the fourier transform of the smoothing function ( [ gauss ] ) is given by @xmath21 and where @xmath22 . squaring the equation ( [ phif ] ) and taking the fourier transform of the smoothing function ,",
    "we find @xmath23 the power spectrum of the field @xmath24 is defined as follows @xmath25 the spectrum of the smoothed field @xmath26 can be expressed taking the ( [ phif2 ] ) .",
    "based on the definition ( [ power ] ) we obtain @xmath27 the effect of the smoothing is exponential suppression of the power spectrum on the scales @xmath28 comparable with @xmath15 . in the next section",
    "we show how this effect modify the inflationary spectrum of quantum fluctuations .",
    "in this section we will consider quantum fluctuations of the scalar field in de sitter inflation . during this phase of evolution the scale factor",
    "is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is hubble factor which is constant .",
    "parameter @xmath31 is conformal time defined as @xmath32 .",
    "the vacuum is given by the bunch - davies mode @xmath33 applying this to the definition ( [ powerf ] ) and introducing the smoothing as in equation ( [ psigma ] ) we find @xmath34 e^{-p^2\\sigma^2}.   \\label{pfds1}\\ ] ] here we have introduced physical momentum @xmath35 in order to simplify the notation . in fig .",
    "[ pf ] we plot function ( [ pfds1 ] ) for two values of @xmath30 .",
    "we also assumed that @xmath36 .        in the super - horizontal limit @xmath37",
    "this spectrum takes the classical form @xmath38 however for the sub - horizontal modes the spectrum is significantly modified by the smoothing effect . in the case with no smoothing , the spectrum is approximated , in this range , by the minkowski vacuum and therefore @xmath39 .",
    "such a behaviour leads to the quadratic uv divergence of the correlation function .",
    "however due to the smoothing , the spectrum is suppressed and uv divergence is removed .",
    "the transition between the minkowski vacuum range and the smoothing domain is in the form of the bump in the power spectrum .",
    "maximum of this bump is located in @xmath40 however while @xmath41 then the maximum of the spectrum is placed in @xmath42 . in this case",
    "bump is not present in the power spectrum .",
    "the spectrum is not scale - invariant in this bump range .",
    "it is namely `` blue '' on the left side with the spectral index @xmath43 .",
    "moreover amplitude of perturbations here can be much bigger that in the super - horizontal domain .",
    "this is interesting feature because e.g. models of primordial black holes formation require such a `` blue '' tilted spectrum in order to resolve problem of the supermassive black holes @xcite .",
    "the spectrum obtained here is free from the uv divergences .",
    "however the ir ( logarithmic ) divergence remains and can be removed only by taking superposition of the positive and negative bunch - davies modes ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "this is naturally obtained e.g. in the models with the contracting ( bounce ) phase before the inflation ( see @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the inflationary spectrum is suppressed also on the large scales ( small @xmath44 ) and ir divergence is removed .",
    "if the lack of divergences is condition for the physical relevance then inflationary model with the bounce and smoothing is favoured .",
    "these both effects can be a result of quantum nature of gravity .",
    "it is interesting to see whether the studied effect of smoothing can lead to any observational imprints . in order to investigate it",
    "we will calculate observed primordial power spectrum .",
    "for the particular @xmath45 mode , the amplitude of perturbations can be calculated during the horizon crossing , namely for @xmath46 .",
    "this gives us @xmath47 however this is very idealised case . in real ,",
    "the modes become _ frozen _ for @xmath48 . in this case spectrum",
    "is given by ( [ pds ] ) and any effects of smoothing are seen .",
    "namely the smoothing factor is now @xmath49 where @xmath50 . if @xmath51 as expected for the standard inflation and @xmath52 then @xmath53 .",
    "therefore the exponential factor is with very high precision equal to one .",
    "therefore we conclude that the effects of smoothing from the inflation are unable to detect .",
    "this can be seen as no - go result , this way of searching for the quantum gravity effects is rather inaccessible .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that in the case of de sitter inflation , the effect of smoothing can be suppression of the total power spectrum . however",
    "when @xmath54 then this effect is negligible and can not be studied observationally . in this section",
    "we will check whether effects of suppression in any other form can be probed observationally .",
    "in particular the _ instantaneous smoothing _ can lead to more significant modifications . in this case smoothing is effective only in some short period of time , therefore the smoothing factor can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the value of the scale factor during the smoothing take place .",
    "based on the cmb observations we can only constraint the joined factor @xmath57 .",
    "the example we will examine in details in this section is direct smoothing of the primordial perturbations .",
    "we will study here rather phenomenological form of modifications of the power spectrum and results obtained can be later related with some specific model . in this case modification will be given by the factor @xmath0 .",
    "for the perturbations generated during the phase of inflation the spectrum can be parametrised in the following form @xmath58 introducing directly effect of smoothing we obtain the spectrum @xmath59 we have used here equation ( [ psigma ] ) with @xmath60 . based on this spectrum",
    "we compute spectrum of the cmb anisotropy and polarisation .",
    "we also find confidence intervals for the parameters of the model , namely on @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath15 . in the numerical calculations we use the publicly available camb @xcite code and markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc )",
    "package cosmo mc @xcite .",
    "the codes were suitably modified to investigate the spectrum ( [ pphen ] ) .",
    "to test our model we use the current astronomical observations from wmap5 @xcite .",
    "we take the standard cosmological parameters as follows @xmath63 and the pivot scale @xmath64 .    in fig .",
    "[ cmb ] we show the obtained tt , te and ee spectra of cmb .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     we show how these spectra are modified by the presence of smoothing .",
    "the evident signature is suppression of the spectra on the high multipoles .",
    "this effect is opposite to the effect of low multipoles suppression , usually considered in context of searching for the departures from the standard cosmological model .",
    "in particular the effect of the bounce can lead to suppression of low multipoles @xcite .",
    "however for the low multipoles , the so - called _ cosmic variance _ becomes significant .",
    "this is serious obstacle in testing cosmological models beyond the standard inflation . on the high multipoles , the effect of _ cosmic variance _ becomes negligible .",
    "however instrumental effects becomes significant here .",
    "resolution of observations can be nonetheless considerably improved by the new missions like planck @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ constraints ] we show the obtained constraints on the parameters @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath15 .    , @xmath62 and @xmath15 . 2d plots : solid lines show the 68 and 95 @xmath2 confidence intervals .",
    "1d plots : dotted lines are mean likelihoods of samples , solid lines are marginalised probabilities.,width=453 ]    we see that values of parameters @xmath62 and @xmath61 are constrained from the both sides . in case of the parameter @xmath15",
    "only upper bound can be found .",
    "based on the five years observations of wmap satellite we find @xmath65 this constraint can be significantly ( by a few orders of magnitude ) improved with the future observations e.g. from planck .",
    "the scale @xmath66 corresponds to the present intergalactic distances .",
    "one can apply the obtained limit to the case of _ instantaneous smoothing _ , then @xmath67 .",
    "let us study a case when the smoothing takes place at the end of inflation , it can be e.g. due to decoherence . taking the @xmath68 gev to be the energy scale at the end of inflation we find @xmath69 . based on this",
    "we find that at the end of inflation , the scale of smoothing is constrained by @xmath70 this is far from the planck scale , however relatively close to the scale of the micro - world where the quantum effects becomes significant .",
    "therefore we speculate that the method can be used to constraint some models of decoherence of the quantum fluctuations .",
    "also the scale of diffusion can be constrained with this result .",
    "in this paper we have considered effects of the scalar field smoothing on the power spectrum .",
    "we considered model where averaging function is given by gaussian shape . based on this",

    "we have applied the smoothing to the quantum fluctuations generated during the phase of cosmic inflation .",
    "we have shown that the spectrum is regularised by the effect of smoothing and uv divergence is removed .",
    "subsequently we have investigated whether smoothing on the planck scale can be probed observationally",
    ". this would be possible way to study quantum gravitational effects .",
    "unfortunately , our investigations suggest rather no - go perspective for this method .",
    "later we have investigated whether smoothing in any other form can be studied observationally .",
    "we have considered phenomenological modification of the inflationary power spectrum due to the smoothing .",
    "we have shown that smoothing can lead to suppression of the high multipoles in the spectrum of the cmb anisotropy and polarisation .",
    "based on five years data from wmap satellite we have derived constraint for the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "we showed that @xmath72 mpc ( 95@xmath2 cl ) .",
    "this size is comparable with distances between galaxies in the galactic cluster .",
    "we have applied this constraint to the model of _ instantaneous smoothing _ at the end of inflation .",
    "we showed that the constraint @xmath3 m is satisfied then .",
    "this is far from the planck scale and can not be used to probe quantum gravity effects .",
    "however models of other physical processes like diffusion or decoherence can be , in principle , constrained .",
    "the quantum scalar field in frw background can be decomposed for the fourier modes as follows @xmath73 here @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the so - called mode functions .",
    "moreover creation and annihilation operator fulfils relations @xmath76=\\delta^{(3)}({\\bf k - p})$ ] and @xmath77= [ \\hat{a}^{\\dagger}_{\\bf k},\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}_{\\bf p } ] = 0 $ ] .",
    "the averaging of the quantum field @xmath78 is performed in the same way like in the classical case , namely @xmath79 now it is straightforward to calculate the correlation function .",
    "we obtain @xmath80 where the power spectrum is defined as follows @xmath81 absorbing the factor @xmath71 in the integral ( [ cor1 ] ) we can define the smoothed spectrum as in equation ( [ psigma ] ) .",
