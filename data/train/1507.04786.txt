    "the so - called _ atlas model _ can informally described as a semi - infinite system of independent brownian motions on @xmath1 , on which the leftmost particle receives a drift towards the right of strength @xmath2 .",
    "this model is the simplest example of diffusions with _",
    "rank - based _ interactions .",
    "these diffusions interacting through their rank have been proposed as a simple model for capitalizations in equity markets , see @xcite , @xcite and the references therein . in @xcite",
    "it is proved that the equilibrium fluctuations of the atlas model converge in a proper scale to the solution of a stochastic heat equation with reflection at the origin .",
    "the ultimate interest of this fluctuation result is that the fluctuations of the leftmost particle can be expressed in the limit as a ( singular ) linear functional of the solution of the stochastic heat equation . in particular one of the main results of @xcite",
    "is that the fluctuations of the leftmost particle are governed by a fractional brownian motion of hurst exponent @xmath3 .",
    "a key observation in order to derive various results about the atlas model , is that the sequence of _ spacings _ between the brownian motions follows a markovian evolution , for which an invariant measure of product form is known to exist .",
    "a natural question turns out to be what happens with a discrete analogous of the atlas model .",
    "a simple discrete analogous of the atlas model consists on a semi - infinite system of particles , on which the first one has a drift towards the right and subjected to the so - called _ exclusion rule _ : no particles can share the same position at any time @xmath4 .",
    "it is well known that such a system of exclusion particles is in bijection with a zero - range process with a reservoir of particles at the origin .",
    "we learned this bijection from @xcite ; although the system treated in @xcite is bi - infinite , the same bijection works for semi - infinite systems of exclusion particles .",
    "the earliest reference we were able to find on which this bijection appears is @xcite . in @xcite , @xcite this relation was exploited to obtain various scaling limits of observables of the exclusion process as a consequence of convergence results for analogous quantities in the zero - range process .",
    "for this reason , we study in this article the _ stationary current fluctuations _ of a zero - range process with a source at the origin .",
    "a formal description of this process is the following .",
    "particles live on the semi - infinite lattice @xmath5 . at each site of the lattice",
    "@xmath6 there is a poissonian clock of rate @xmath7 . each time the clock at site @xmath8 rings , one of the particles at site @xmath9 moves to @xmath10 or @xmath11 with equal probability .",
    "if the particle decides to move to @xmath12 , then the particle leaves the system .",
    "in addition , with exponential rate @xmath13 a particle is created at site @xmath14 .",
    "burke s theorem says that for @xmath15 the product measure with geometric marginals of success rate @xmath13 is invariant under this evolution .",
    "denote by @xmath16 the signed current of particles between sites @xmath9 and @xmath11 up to time @xmath17 . for @xmath18",
    ", @xmath19 denotes the number of particles that entered into the system , minus the number of particles that left the system up to time @xmath17 .",
    "the current @xmath16 denotes exactly the displacement of the @xmath9-th particle up to time @xmath4 in an exclusion process where particles are ordered from left to right .",
    "all but the leftmost exclusion particle are symmetric ; the leftmost particle jumps to the right with rate @xmath20 and it jumps to the left with rate @xmath13 . in @xcite , it is shown that under a diffusive scaling , the space - time limit of the fluctuations of the density of particles is given by a conservative stochastic heat equation , better known as an _ ornstein - uhlenbeck equation_. with some extra work , this result can be used to derive the scaling limit of the current fluctuations as well .",
    "let @xmath21 be a scaling parameter .",
    "if we want the exclusion process to serve as a discrete approximation of the atlas model , it is reasonable to scale @xmath13 with @xmath22 in such a way that the leftmost particle behaves like a brownian motion with drift in the limit @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to take @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the drift of the limiting brownian motion .",
    "we will start the zero - range process with the invariant measure associated to @xmath26 , namely a product of geometric distributions with parameter @xmath27 .",
    "notice that the average number of particles per site grows linearly with @xmath22 .",
    "it turns out that the proof of @xcite breaks down in that case .",
    "the heart of the proof of the convergence of the density fluctuation field is the so - called _ boltzmann - gibbs principle _ , which roughly states that any observable of a conservative particle system is asymptotically equivalent to a linear functional of the density of particles .",
    "the main issue is that the density of particles per site is equal to @xmath28 and it grows to infinity as @xmath23 . because of that , a key compactness argument in the classical proof of the so - called boltzmann - gibbs principle does not work . in @xcite , a quantitative proof of the boltzmann - gibbs principle",
    "was proposed .",
    "it turns out that in our situation , this alternative proof allows to circumvent the compactness argument by the use of the so - called _ spectral gap inequality _ , which gives a sharp bound on the largest eigenvalue of the dynamics restricted to a finite box .",
    "for the version of the zero - range process considered in this article , the spectral gap inequality was proved in @xcite . for zero - range processes with other interaction rates , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "according to @xcite , the spectral gap of the zero - range process presented here has a non - trivial dependence on the total number of particles .",
    "therefore , the proof of the quantitative boltzmann - gibbs principle of @xcite needs to be adapted accordingly .    with the boltzmann - gibbs as principal tool",
    ", we prove that in the stationary state the space - time fluctuations of the current converge to the solution of the stochastic heat equation @xmath29 with zero initial datum .",
    "in particular , as in @xcite the current of particles through the origin converges to a brownian motion of hurst parameter @xmath3 .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we introduce the zero - range process with a source at the origin , we define what do we understand by the _ current fluctuation field _ and we state the main results of this article . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we state and give a sketch of proof of various estimates related to the variance of additive functionals of markov processes .",
    "the exposition follows closely the one of @xcite , and proofs already included in @xcite are omitted . in section [ s4 ]",

    "the dynamics of this process is not hard to describe . at each site",
    "@xmath8 the process waits an exponential time of rate @xmath7 , at the end of which one particle jumps from @xmath9 to one of this two neighbors with equal probability .",

    "this observation explains the factor @xmath200 in the definition of @xmath56 : the exponent @xmath201 is tied to the time scale @xmath202 .",
