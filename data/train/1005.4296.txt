    "all bodies are surrounded by a fluctuating electromagnetic field due to the thermal and quantum fluctuations of the charge and current density inside the bodies . outside the bodies this fluctuating electromagnetic field exists partly in the form of propagating electromagnetic waves and partly in the form of evanescent waves .",
    "the theory of the fluctuating electromagnetic field was developed by rytov @xcite .",
    "a great variety of phenomena such as casimir - lifshitz forces @xcite , near - field radiative heat transfer @xcite , and friction forces @xcite can be described using this theory .",
    "lifshitz @xcite used the rytov s theory to formulate a very general theory of the dispersion interaction using statistical physics and macroscopic electrodynamics .",
    "the lifshitz theory provides a common tool to deal with dispersive forces in different fields of science ( physics , biology , chemistry ) and technology .",
    "the lifshitz theory is valid for systems at thermal equilibrium . at present",
    "there is an interest in the study of systems out of the thermal equilibrium ( see @xcite and reference therein ) , in particular in the connection with the possibility of tuning the strength and sign of the interaction@xcite .",
    "such systems also present a way to explore the role of thermal fluctuations , which usually are masked at thermal equilibrium by the @xmath0 k component , which dominates the interaction up to very large distances , where the interaction force is very small . in ref .",
    "@xcite the casimir - lifshitz force was measured at very large distances , and it was shown that the thermal effects on the casimir - lifshitz interaction agree with the theoretical prediction .",
    "this measurement was done out of thermal equilibrium , where thermal effects are stronger .",
    "non - equilibrium thermal effects was also studied by polder and van hove@xcite , who calculated the heat - flux between two parallel plates . at present",
    "there is an increasing interest in near - field radiative heat transfer@xcite , in the connection with the development of near - field scanning thermal microscopy@xcite .",
    "the existing studies are limited mostly to the case when the interacting bodies are at rest . for recent reviews of near - field radiative heat transfer between bodies , which are at rest ,",
    ".    non - equilibrium effects always prevail for bodies moving relative to each other . in ref.@xcite",
    "we used a dynamical modification of the lifshitz theory to calculate the friction force between two parallel surfaces in relative motion ( velocity @xmath1 ) .",
    "the calculation of the van der waals friction is more complicated than of the casimir - lifshitz force ( and of the radiative heat transfer ) , because it requires the determination of the electromagnetic field between moving boundaries .",
    "the solution can be found by writing the boundary conditions on the surface of each body in the rest reference frame of this body .",
    "the relation between the electromagnetic fields in the different reference frames is determined by the lorenz transformation . in ref.@xcite the electromagnetic field in the vacuum gap between the bodies was calculated to linear order in @xmath2 .",
    "these linear terms corresponds to mixing of electromagnetic waves with different polarizations .",
    "the waves with different polarization are statistically independent .",
    "thus after averaging of the stress tensor over the fluctuating electromagnetic field , the mixing terms will give a contribution to the friction force of order @xmath3 .",
    "in ref.@xcite the mixing terms were neglected , and the resulting formula for friction force is accurate to order @xmath3 . the same approximation was used in ref.@xcite to calculate the frictional drag between quantum wells , and in refs.@xcite to calculate the friction force between plane parallel surfaces in normal relative motion . in ref .",
    "@xcite the correctness of the approach based on the dynamical modification of the lifshitz theory was confirmed ( at least to linear order in the sliding velocity @xmath1 ) by rigorous quantum mechanical calculations ( using the kubo formula for friction coefficient ) . for recent reviews of the van der waals friction",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we presented a of unified approach to the casimir - lifshitz forces and the radiative heat transfer at nonequilibrium conditions , when the bodies are at different temperatures , and move relative to each other with an arbitrary velocity @xmath1 . in comparison with previous calculations@xcite , we did not make any approximation in the lorentz transformation of the electromagnetic field .",
    "thus , we could determine the field in one inertial reference frame , knowing the same field in another reference frame , and our solution of the electromagnetic problem was exact . knowing the electromagnetic field we calculated the stress tensor and the poynting vector which determined the casimir - lifshitz forces and the heat transfer , respectively . upon going to the limit when one of the bodies is rarefied we obtained the interaction force and the heat transfer for a small particle - surface configuration .",
    "in the recent papers philbin and leonhardt @xcite ( henceforth refereed to as pl ) calculated the casimir - lifshitz forces due to electromagnetic fluctuations between two perfectly flat parallel dielectric surfaces separated by vacuum and moving parallel to each other .",
    "in ref.@xcite lp used lifshitz theory @xcite and considered only the case of zero temperature .",
    "lifshitz theory @xcite also included the effect of thermal radiation in his analysis .",
    "the _ casimir - lifshitz effect _ is therefore also taken to describe forces that have a contribution from thermal radiation as well as from the quantum vacuum . the formalism developed by lifshitz",
    ", however , can not be used for plates at different temperatures .",
