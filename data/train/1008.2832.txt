    "galaxy evolution and the effects of environment upon it , is one of the major areas of modern research in extragalactic astronomy , being the cluster environment of great interest given the variety of processes present there .",
    "most galaxies reside in galaxy clusters , where the highest volume densities of galaxies are found , offering a unique laboratory to study the effects of the environment on different galactic properties . given the high density of galaxies in these systems ,",
    "any environmental dependence should be more pronounced , in contrast with the field .",
    "one such dependency is the morphology - density relation ( dressler 1980 ; treu et al .",
    "2003 ) , in which the average morphology of galaxies changes as a function of the local environment .",
    "subsequent studies ( e.g. , whitmore & gilmore 1991 ; whitmore , gilmore & jones 1993 ) have shown that the morphology - clustercentric radius relation seems tighter than the morphology - local density relation , and explained the origin of this relation as a result of galaxy interactions with the mean tidal field of the clusters , but the exact nature of the processes responsible for establishing these relations are still open to debate .    in galaxy clusters ,",
    "a possible mechanism for the morphology transformation is ram pressure stripping , proposed by gunn & gott ( 1972 ) . according to this model , the ram pressure of the intracluster medium sweeps away gas from the galactic disks as they fall at high speed into the cluster , making the remaining galaxy",
    "take an early type appearance .",
    "however , the entire structure transformation , such as the thickening of the discs or the large bulge - to - disc ratios , can not be explained by this process alone ( for a discussion see , e. g. , dressler 1984 ) .",
    "interactions between galaxies are another agent of morphological transformations acting through different mechanisms , such as galaxy harassment via high - speed encounters , specially effective in transforming faint sc - sd galaxies into dsphs and even lsbs ( moore et al . 1996 ) ; galaxy mergers that exhaust a large amount of the interstellar gas of interacting gas - rich spirals ( fujita 1998 ) , or dramatically destroy galactic discs and thereby convert spiral galaxies into ellipticals and lenticulars ( toomre & toomre 1972 ) .    finally , tidal interactions with the cluster as a whole are also a source of morphological transformations . as galaxies fall into the cluster ,",
    "the outer part of their haloes will be stripped by the tides produced by the cluster potential ( white & rees 1978 ; mamon 1992 ) , and , as soon as they enter the cluster , will experience interactions with the substructure within the cluster .",
    "the tidal field interaction with the cluster can also induce collisions of disc gas clouds that trigger enhanced nuclear and disc activity ( byrd & valtonen 1990 ) , while the compressive effect of the interaction within the core of the cluster increases the random velocities of the components of the disc with a corresponding thickening of the disc ( valluri 1993 ) .",
    "the complete explanation probably includes the joint participation of several of these processes for transforming the overall structure of galaxies in the cluster environment .    among galaxy morphology ,",
    "many physical parameters have been reported to depend on the environment ( see blanton & moustakas 2009 for a review )",
    ". using a sample of galaxies with visually classified morphologies , skibba et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found that much of the morphology - density relation is due to the relation between colour and density .",
    "as for the star formation rate , kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that it presents the most sensitive dependence on environment between the properties analyzed on their study and , deng ( 2010 ) showed that this dependence prevails even at fixed morphology , being the dependence for late - type galaxies stronger than for early - types .",
    "the case of agn activity seems to follow two different behaviours in low and high density environments , in low density environments the fraction of agn - host galaxies tends to increase as the local density increases , but it decreases in high density environments ( lee et al .",
    "2010 ) , specially in the inner regions of clusters where the high velocity dispersion of galaxies prevents long term interactions and mergers which are the principal driving mechanisms in triggering agn activity ( best 2004 ) .",
    "the decrease in luminosity for high density environments ( park , gott & choi 2008 ; robotham , phillipps & de propris 2010 ) , and the dependence of the petrosian radius and central surface brightness on the clustercentric distance ( coenda & muriel 2009 ) have also been studied , as well as relations between different galaxy properties such as the size - luminosity relation that appears to be independent of the local environment , sensitive mostly to galactic morphology ( coenda & muriel 2009 ; nair , van den bergh & abraham 2010 ) , although if morphological transformations are taking place in high density environments , the issue could be more complicated ; the colour magnitude relation being an other empirical relation that shows a trend for systematically bluer galaxy colours with increasing projected radius from the centre of the cluster , accompanied by a decreased on the internal scatter ( terlevich , caldwell & bower 2001 .",
    "however , there is a debate about the role played by the large - scale background density , in comparison to the local density , in determining galaxy morphology .",
    "recently , park , gott & choi ( 2008 ) and park & choi ( 2009 ) , found that some galaxy properties , like morphology and luminosity , strongly depend on the distance and morphology of the nearest neighbour galaxy , even at fixed large - scale background density , with important effects at a characteristic scale given by the virial radius of the nearest neighbour ( see also hwang & park 2009 ) .",
    "outside this scale , galaxy morphology still depends on the distance to the nearest galaxy , but showing no dependence on the morphology of the companion .",
    "this indicates that galaxies interact hydrodynamically when they are close enough , though the interaction is purely gravitational at larger separation distances .",
    "given the statistical correlation of galaxy - galaxy interactions with the large - scale background density , plus the additional influence of the gravitational interaction , galaxy - cluster potential , an underlying relation between structural parameters of cluster galaxies and clustercentric radius is expected .",
    "park & hwang ( 2009 ; henceforth ph09 ) studied galaxy properties as a function of both ; clustercentric radius and nearest neighbour galaxy distance , and found that the structural and kinematic parameters of late - type galaxies such as the concentration index and the central velocity dispersion depend mainly on the clustercentric radius , but the star formation activity indicators like the u - r colour and the equivalent width of h@xmath2 line , depend predominantly on the nearest neighbour distance .",
    "the former finding may indicate important effects , or repeated interactions with neighbouring galaxies , or galaxy - cluster potential interactions on the internal structure of intermediate mass galaxies , in contradiction with the predictions of the ram pressure stripping scenario .",
    "intimately linked with the morphology and present day structure of galaxies is the galactic spin .",
    "theoretical studies of galaxy formation and evolution , show the major role played by this physical parameter in determining properties such as the star formation efficiency of disc galaxies ( dalcanton , spergel & summers 1997 ; van den bosch 1998 ) , the bulge to disc ratio ( van den bosch 1998 ) , color gradients ( prantzos & boissier 2000 ) , and gas content ( churches , nelson & edmunds 2001 , boissier et al 2001 ) , as well as playing a major role in explaining the dispersion about many empirical relations such as the tully - fisher relation ( koda , sofue & wada 2000 ) and specially the size - dependent relations such as the size - luminosity relation ( courteau et al . 2007 ) , to mention just a few .",
    "all these parameters , related with the overall morphology of the galaxies , show , to a certain degree , dependences with the environment , specially for cluster systems .    motivated by theoretical studies ( e.g. fall & efstathiou 1980 ; van der kruit 1987 ; flores et al . 1993 ; firmani et al .",
    "1996 ; mo , mao & white 1998 ; prantzos & boissier 2000 ) , hernandez & cervantes - sodi ( 2006 ) and later cervantes - sodi & hernandez ( 2009 ) , showed , with different samples of well studied galaxies , how the spin parameter correlates with several galactic properties , like the bulge - to - disc ratio , disc thickness , colours , metallicity and gas abundance .",
    "the above , using a simple estimate of the actual galactic @xmath3 parameter , based on easily available observational quantities .",
    "the galaxies analysed showed a systematic increase of the spin when moving from early to late type spiral galaxies , and in hernandez et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , a match is found for the hubble type with the angular momentum @xmath3 parameter when comparing against a colour versus colour gradient criteria ( park & choi 2005 ) , where the segregation by spin coincides with the segregation by hubble type , as visually assigned for a large sample of spiral galaxies from the sdss .",
    "this demonstrated the plausibility of the identification of the @xmath3 galactic spin parameter as the principal physical parameter driving galactic morphology , and has recently been used as such by e.g. berta et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and gogarten et al .",
    "the above , under the approximate estimate for @xmath3 proposed in hernandez & cervantes - sodi ( 2006 ) , and shown to be an unbiassed estimator for the true @xmath3 parameter through extensive comparisons with simulated galaxies in cervantes - sodi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the possible dependence of the galactic angular momentum on the cluster environment , given the tight link between @xmath3 and morphology , and the morphology - clustercentric radius relation . in going to a",
    "physically well defined and objective parameter to measure type , we can complement existing qualitative studies working on more subjectively assigned type parameters and perform for example , meaningful comparisons with models and physical identification of the main causes of the evolution seen in clusters .    the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the derivation of the dimensionless angular momentum parameter used to characterize the morphology of the galaxies in our sample , in section 3 we introduce the sample used in the study , followed by the results and a discussion in section 4 and our general conclusions in section 5 .",
    "traditionally , the galactic angular momentum is characterized by the @xmath3 parameter as introduced by peebles ( 1969 ) ;    @xmath4    where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the total energy , mass and angular momentum of the configuration , respectively . in hernandez & cervantes - sodi ( 2006 )",
    "we derived a simple estimate of total @xmath3 for dark halos hosting disc galaxies in terms of observational parameters , based on two simple hypothesis : that the specific angular momentum of dark matter and baryons are equal , and a constant small baryonic fraction , for systems where the total energy and angular momentum are dominated by the dark matter component .",
    "the problem with galaxies residing in clusters is that the diversity of the interactions taking place in that environment can drastically change the baryonic fraction and disturb the baryonic and dark matter angular momentum profiles in different ways , invalidating these two previous hypothesis .",
    "for example , tidal forces can shear off most of the original dark halo of a given galaxy .",
    "we must therefore use an angular momentum parameter which focuses on the dynamics of the baryonic galaxy .",
    "we retain the quantitative and objective nature of the study , and account for the angular momentum focusing only on the baryonic component to define a baryonic dimensionless angular momentum parameter @xmath0 .    in our model , we consider a disc for the baryonic component of the galaxy with an exponential surface mass density @xmath8 ;    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is a radial coordinate and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are two constants which are allowed to vary from galaxy to galaxy , and assume the presence of a dark matter halo responsible for establishing a rigorously flat rotation curve @xmath13 throughout the disc .    from equation  [ expprof ] , the total disc mass is    @xmath14    that combined with our flat rotation curve leads to an angular momentum of @xmath15 .",
    "assuming the disk to be a virialized dynamical system , the total energy can be obtained from the total kinetic energy , estimated as arising merely from the dominant rotation . in this case , the kinetic energy of the disc is @xmath16 .",
    "these assumptions allow us to express @xmath0 as    @xmath17    finally , we introduce a baryonic disc tully - fisher ( tf ) ( e.g gurovich et al .",
    "2004 , mcgaugh et al .",
    "2005 ) relation : @xmath18 , to replace the dependence on mass for a dependence on @xmath13 , to obtain :    @xmath19    the presence of an intrinsic dispersion in the tully - fisher relation dominates the budget of our internal errors , and results in a 25% uncertainty associated to each individual @xmath0 estimate .",
    "basically , equation  [ ld ] is the same expression we derived in hernandez & cervantes - sodi ( 2006 ) to estimate the traditional @xmath3 spin parameter for dark matter haloes hosting disc galaxies , divided by the baryonic fraction of the galaxy ; this because to obtain the total spin parameter we were assuming angular momentum conservation for both components , and a constant baryonic fraction , linking the specific angular momentum and mass of the dark matter to those quantities of the baryonic component , while in our current work , we do not attempt to constrain the physical characteristics of the halo , but just consider its participation in establishing the flat rotation curve throughout the disc .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is hence not a @xmath3 parameter in the sense of the definition of equation  [ lamdef ] , but merely an estimate of a dimensionless angular momentum for a galactic disk , expected to correlate tightly with all type defining properties , as already pointed out in the introduction .    as can be seen from equation ( 5 ) ,",
    "our estimate of @xmath0 is a measure of disk scale length and rotational velocity or total luminosity by introducing a tully - fisher relation ( tf ) , and therefore , equivalent to a measure of the size - luminosity relation .",
    "however , we prefer to present our results in terms of a dimensionless disk angular momentum , given the clear interpretation and well established theoretical expectations from galactic structure models in terms of this parameter ( dalcanton , spergel & summers 1997 ; prantzos & boissier 2000 ; hernandez & cervantes - sodi 2006 ) , of which our estimate will be an accurate approximation , for exponential disks having flat rotation curves , as late type galaxies ubiquitously present .",
    "the sample of cluster galaxies used in this work is an updated version of the ph09 sample ( hwang et al .",

    "they tested extensively the selection criteria through direct comparison of visually assigned types for a large sample of several thousand galaxies .",

    "( 2007 ) . to avoid the problem of internal absorption in edge - on galaxies ( unterborn & ryden 2008 ; cho & park 2009 ) , and consequently underestimating rotational velocities , we limit the sample to spiral galaxies having seeing - corrected isophotal axis ratios @xmath40 .",
    "when studying the influence of a nearby galaxy on the value of the spin , the distance between galaxies is normalized to the virial radius of the nearest neighbour .",
    "the nearest neighbour galaxy of a target galaxy with absolute magnitude m@xmath41 is the one with the smallest projected separation distance on the sky to the galaxy , and is brighter than @xmath42 among those in the cluster galaxy sample , with @xmath43 .",
    "this particular value is chosen to assure a large enough sample , so as to get statistically significant results .",
    "we define the virial radius of a galaxy as the projected radius where the mean mass density within the sphere of radius @xmath44 is 200 times the critical density or 740 times the mean density of the universe ;    @xmath45    with the relative mass - to - light ratios for early type galaxies ( ellipticals and lenticulars ) twice the same ratio for the late types ( spirals ) , @xmath46 , following choi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who report that the central velocity dispersion of early type galaxies brighter than @xmath47 , is about @xmath48 times that of late types .",
    "since we adopt @xmath49 , we have @xmath50 , which is almost equal to the virialized density @xmath51 , in the case of a @xmath34cdm universe ( gott & rees 1975 ) .",
    "finally , we introduced the mean value for the density of the universe , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the mass of a late type galaxy with @xmath54 ( park et al .",
    "2008 ) . in this way , the virial radii of galaxies with @xmath47 , @xmath5520.0 and @xmath5520.5 are 260 , 300 and 350@xmath21 kpc for early types and 210 , 240 and 280@xmath21 kpc for late types , respectively . for more details on the sample , consult ph09 and hwang et al .",
    "in the interest of establishing the dependence of the angular momentum on the cluster environment , we first calculate the mean value of @xmath0 as a function of the clustercentric radius normalised to the virial radius of the cluster @xmath56 . once having segregated the galaxies into early and late types , we employed equation  [ ld ] to obtain the spin for the disc galaxies in the sample .",
    "figure  [ plotspirals ] presents the median spin value for disc galaxies as a function of the clustercentric radius for all clusters in the sample taken together , where error bars denote the estimated 1@xmath57 confidence intervals based on the bootstraping re - sampling method . when approaching the center of the cluster , we note a slight increase of @xmath0 and then a systematic drop for @xmath58 , with the trend becoming more pronounced on crossing the virial radius of the clusters , as defined through equation  [ rvircluster ] . to assess the statistical significance of the trend",
    ", we performed a @xmath59 test taking as null hypothesis that the trend is consistent with a flat line given by the weighted mean of the data points . by computing the sum of @xmath59 s for the data points of figure  [ plotspirals ] , weighted by their corresponding associated errors , we rule out the null hypothesis at a 99.1% level .    the only possible exception to",
    "this trend is in the innermost bin , with the highest formal uncertainty on the median @xmath0 value , and where the proximity between galaxies could make the identification of individual systems difficult .",
    "because , in our sample , the typical offset of the brightest cluster galaxy from the cluster center is about @xmath60 , the uncertainty in determining the cluster center can be as large as the offset .",
    "we will present our results below only for clustercentric radii larger than @xmath60 . in spite of a close to 25% uncertainty in each individual estimate of @xmath0 , the very large numbers in our sample result in this slight trend being larger than our internal uncertainties , it is hence a real detection .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     in the preceding subsection , we showed the joint effect that galaxy - galaxy and galaxy - cluster interactions have in modifying the spin of disc galaxies .",
    "given that galaxies immersed in massive galaxy clusters present the strongest @xmath0 dependence on the clustercentric radius , we are interested in pondering the importance of each of these processes for different cases . figure  [ cluster - neigh ] presents two different cases , in the upper panel galaxies immersed in low mass clusters ( @xmath61 700 km s@xmath20 ) , the lower panel with galaxies of massive clusters ( @xmath62 700 km s@xmath20 ) , all of them segregated according to the distance to the nearest neighbour . for the case of massive clusters , the trend with the clustercentric radius is clear for all the galaxies , regardless of the presence of a nearby companion , indicating an origin for the trend independent of recent galaxy interactions , rather grounded on galaxy - cluster interactions .",
    "we confirm this conclusion by a @xmath59 test for the two sub - samples of figure  [ cluster - neigh ] lower panel , following the same trend , drawn as the average weighted one derived from the two originals , with a level of significance @xmath63 86.9% .",
    "the case of low mass clusters is completely different , where interacting galaxies depart from the trend of non - interacting galaxies as can be seen in figure  [ cluster - neigh ] upper panel , with a significance level @xmath64 67.2% for the two classes to follow the same trend , derived as the average weighted one of the two originals .",
    "clearly , in these systems the gravitational interaction with the cluster potential is diminished due to its low mass , and the effect of ongoing interactions with close neighbours dominates .",
    "for interacting galaxies in low mass clusters , distance to the cluster centre is not a factor in fixing the internal dynamics or type , as galaxy - galaxy interactions are driving morphological changes , being the overall cluster effects secondary . on the other hand , for massive clusters",
    "the trend for diminishing @xmath0 as cluster - centric distances drop , holds identically both for interacting and non - interacting galaxies , being galaxy - cluster interactions responsible for the leading dynamical evolution of galaxies .",
    "using a large sample of cluster galaxies , we study the dependence of the galactic angular momentum on the environment , accounted for by the clustercentric radius , and found a slight increase of the median value of our dimensionless angular momentum parameter , as we approach the clusters and a systematic decrease as we approach the central region .",
    "this @xmath0-clustercentric radius relation is not equally followed by all galaxies ; only low and intermediate mass galaxies present this dependence on the clustercentric radius , while the spin of massive galaxies is more robust .",
    "a possible interpretation for the different response of massive galaxies could be the relative stability of these systems against perturbations , such as galaxy - galaxy or galaxy - cluster interactions , harassment or ram pressure stripping , given the depth of their gravitational potentials , and their different formation time ; as recently pointed out by huertas - company et al .",
    "2009 , it seems that these galaxies experience little evolution in the cluster environment , as they were probably formed at higher redshifts before entering the cluster in infalling groups .    given the increased proximity of galaxies in the central parts of galaxy clusters , the trend found could arise directly from galaxy - galaxy interactions in this environment . to test if the trend is established only by ongoing interactions with neighbouring galaxies , we tested if the galaxies followed the same trend regardless of the presence of nearby companions . to this end , we split the sample into galaxies having their nearest neighbour galaxy within one pre - establish distance , given in terms of the virial radius of the neighbour ( 1.0@xmath65 or 0.3@xmath65 ) .",
    "the result is very similar for both cases , the trend is shown by interacting and non - interacting galaxies , and regardless of the morphology of the nearest neighbour , with minor differences within the statistical errors of reported values .    the trend seems to be followed only in massive enough galaxy clusters , where gravitational interactions of the galaxies with the cluster potential prevail over galaxy - galaxy interactions , which is not the case for low mass clusters .",
    "below @xmath66 km / s for the clusters , one is dealing with an effective large group , in regards to galactic morphology transformations , which are mostly determined by galaxy - galaxy interactions , and only the case of non - interacting galaxies present the trend with the clustercentric radius .",
    "the primary point we want to emphasize is the clear dependence of our @xmath0 estimate of the galactic spin on the clustercentric radius , even at fixed stellar mass of the galaxies , with typically low @xmath0 values in the inner regions of galaxy clusters .",
    "the trend is dependent on the mass of the galaxies , shown only in low and intermediate mass galaxies , while the @xmath0 value of massive galaxies show essentially low values when compared with less massive galaxies .",
    "the influence of ongoing galaxy - galaxy interactions on the spin is present , but can not account for the trend with the clustercentric radius in massive galaxy clusters with @xmath1 km / s , where galaxy - cluster interactions dominate and drive morphological transformations .",
    "having an objective and quantitative parameter to assess galactic type and its transformations , allows us to complement and better understand qualitative studies based on less objective type assessments , such as measures of e / s fractions .",
