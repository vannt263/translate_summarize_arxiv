    "the dark umbral background is populated by small , bright features called umbral dots ( uds ) . the size of uds ranges from 08 to about 02 based on previous studies by @xcite and @xcite , while a recent work by @xcite shows that the size distribution of ud diameters is a maximum around 03 or 225 km , suggesting that most of the uds are spatially resolved .",
    "@xcite also observed that the larger , long - lived uds are seen in regions of enhanced umbral background intensity .",
    "the darkest parts of the umbral core , referred to as dark nuclei , are often devoid of uds . based on their relative location",
    ", uds can be classified as `` central '' and `` peripheral '' .",
    "while the former are seen in the inner regions of the umbra , the latter dominate the umbra - penumbra boundary .",
    "peripheral uds are usually brighter than the central ones .",
    "the intensity of uds ranges from about 0.2 to 0.7 times the normal photospheric intensity at visible wavelengths .",
    "the typical speeds of uds are @xmath3 400 m  s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "most mobile uds emerge near the umbra - penumbra boundary and move towards the center of the umbra @xcite with speeds of 700 m  s@xmath2 .",
    "uds do not have a typical lifetime , with values ranging from 10 min to 2.5 min @xcite .",
    "the spread in the values arises from the manner in which uds can be grouped based on their size , lifetime and spatial location .",
    "@xcite proposed that uds are manifestations of hot non - magnetized plasma pushing its way in the gappy umbral field .",
    "while the detection of such weak fields in the umbra remains elusive , observations indicate a reduction of 300 - 500 g in uds @xcite with the contrasted ones residing in locations where the magnetic field is @xmath3 2000 g and is inclined more than 30@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "central and peripheral uds exhibit an enhancement in temperature of 550 k and 570 k respectively @xcite .",
    "the measurements of doppler velocities in uds show that peripheral uds have an upflow of @xmath3 0.4 - 0.8 km  s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "central uds on the other hand exhibit very weak downflows @xcite while @xcite detected downflows of upto 0.3 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite reported downflows at the edge of uds measuring 400 to 1000 m  s@xmath2 at a spatial resolution of 014 .",
    "3d mhd simulations of @xcite , which model uds as narrow upflowing plumes in regions of intense magnetic fields , predicted a central dark lane in uds which was subsequently verified from high resolution ground based observations @xcite as well as from space @xcite .",
    "recent observations from the 1.6 m nst indicate that uds are not perfectly circular but possess a mean eccentricity of 0.74 in the photosphere @xcite .",
    "the extent to which uds can be resolved depends on the spatial resolution which is presently 014 @xcite for a 1 m ground based telescope at 450 nm .",
    "this has been made possible with the aid of adaptive optics and post - processing techniques to minimize the contribution from `` seeing '' .",
    "on the other hand , _ hinode _ @xcite with a 50 cm aperture in space has a resolution of 023 at the same wavelength which can operate for long periods in the absence of the earth s atmospheric turbulence .",
    "furthermore , since uds are present in the darkest regions of sunspots , contamination by stray light can strongly influence photometric investigation of these structures .",
    "the motivation of this paper is to study the influence of stray light on the properties of uds using _ hinode _ data and how its removal compares with existing high resolution ground - based observations as well as numerical simulations .",
    "this exercise has been done taking into account the trade off between marginally coarser spatial resolution and the uninterrupted `` seeing - free '' time sequence between _ hinode _ and its 1 m ground based counterpart .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the observations are described in section  [ data ] and the results are presented in section  [ res ] . in section  [ summary ]",
    "we summarize our findings and discuss their implications .",
    "we utilize high resolution blue continuum filtergrams of the sunspot in noaa ar 10944 acquired by the bfi ( broadband filter imager ) of the sot ( solar optical telescope ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , on board _ hinode _ from 00:14 - 02:34 ut on march 1 , 2007 .",
    "the sunspot was located very close to disc center ( n0.7w4 ) at a heliocentric angle of @xmath5 4@xmath6 .",
    "the 1024@xmath7512 filtergrams had a pixel sampling of 0054 and were taken at a cadence of 6 s with an exposure time of 102 ms .",
    "initial processing of level-0 data to level-1 included dark correction , flat fielding and removal of bad pixels , and was carried out using the `` _ fg_prep _ '' routine in solarsoft .",
    "the images were subsequently co - aligned using a 2d cross correlation routine .    in order to reduce the noise in the dark regions of the umbra",
    ", four successive filtergrams were added to yield a sequence of 326 images with a cadence of @xmath8 26 s. the averaging was carried out to keep the temporal resolution identical to the analysis of @xcite who had previously studied the same ar with the above data set . applying the running average to the filtergrams leads to a reduction of power especially in the high spatial frequency domain as shown in the top panel of figure  [ power_spec ] which depicts the azimuthally averaged power spectrum .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ power_spec ] illustrates the difference in power between the single and mean image as a function of the spatial scale .",
    "since the power is proportional to the square of the intensity , the relative intensity difference between the images varies from 2% to 5% for spatial scales of 02 and 05 , respectively .",
    "this implies that averaging successive filtergrams should not significantly affect the detection of small scale structures within the umbra .",
    "we estimate the intensity fluctuations in the umbra to be 1.5% of the quiet sun ( qs ) intensity .",
    "this value corresponds to three times the standard deviation of a small region in the umbral dark core .",
    "averaging the filtergrams reduces the noise by @xmath36% .",
    "_ insrumental stray light : _ the blue continuum filtergrams were corrected for instrumental stray light using the psf ( point spread function ) described by @xcite .",
    "this psf was derived from transit observations of mercury on november 8 , 2006 .",
    "@xcite showed that the removal of stray light renders an improvement in the contrast of bright points in the quiet sun by a factor of 2.4 - 2.75 at 430 nm .",
    "as the transit observations were taken close to disc center , the same psf was utilized for removing stray light in the blue continuum filtergrams .",
    "the psf is a weighted linear combination of 4 gaussians ( see table 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "the deconvolution is carried out using an idl maximum likelihood routine @xcite .",
    "the method uses the instrument psf to iteratively update the current estimate of the image by the product of the previous deconvolution and the correlation between re - convolution of the subsequent image and the psf .",
    "the algorithm can be expressed as follows : @xmath9 the image ( @xmath10 ) is a result of the convolution between the object ( @xmath11 ) and the point spread function @xmath12 .",
    "given @xmath10 and @xmath12 , the most likely @xmath11 can be iteratively determined as : @xmath13 where @xmath14 under the assumption of poisson statistics . here",
    "@xmath15 refers to the iteration cycle .    the corrected and uncorrected sequences were subsequently normalized to the qs intensity .",
    "figure  [ umb_sta ] shows a typical scatter plot of intensities in a corrected filtergram and the corresponding uncorrected image .",
    "following stray light correction , the minimum umbral intensity corresponding to the dark umbral core , reduces from 0.1@xmath1 to 0.05@xmath1 which is above the estimated noise level in the the filtergrams .",
    "in addition , the fraction of pixels in the umbra having an intensity less than 0.3@xmath1 in both sets of images is @xmath3 93% .",
    "the removal of stray light decreases the mean umbral intensity from 0.202@xmath1 to 0.167@xmath1 while the @xmath0 contrast increases from 0.059 to 0.086 which is a factor of 1.45 .",
    "the middle and bottom panels of figure  [ umb ] show the uncorrected and corrected image respectively .",
    "the umbral region is extracted from the sunspot shown as the contoured region ( top panel of figure  [ umb ] ) .",
    "the stray light corrected image exhibits various fine scale features which are described in the following section .",
    "hereafter ` uncorrected ' and ` corrected ' will be referred to as un and cr respectively.eugene/movie-umbral-dots.wmv_ ]",
    "\\(a ) _ short filaments : _ figure  [ umb ] depicts three examples of short filaments ( shown in _ dashed circles _ ) near the periphery of the umbra that closely resemble penumbral filaments . these short structures have varying lengths with a dark lane and two adjacent brightenings , and a bead - like brightening at the tip of the filament facing the umbra .",
    "the width of the filaments shown in the figure range from 165 - 200 km where the latter can be considered an upper limit for these structures .",
    "these dark filaments are similar to the ones reported by @xcite and in numerical simulations @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that such filaments have been seen in _ hinode",
    "_ observations .",
    "their morphology is different from the traditional dark lane associated with uds as observed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the filament indicated by the largest circle in the bottom panel of figure  [ umb ] partially obscures a neighboring filament to its right .",
    "figure  [ filam ] depicts the temporal evolution of a set of dark filaments and bright uds .",
    "one can identify at least two main filaments labeled f1 and f2 .",
    "the time separation between individual frames is 100 s. the lifetime of f1 and f2 is estimated to be 18 and 10 min respectively .",
    "these values can be regarded as lower limits since both of them were present from the start of the sequence .",
    "the _ black plus _",
    "symbol marks the position of a bright grain / ud which is seen during the chosen sequence .",
    "the ud starts at the end of f2 and ends adjacent to f1 on its left .",
    "the total displacement of the ud from frame 1 to 11 ( cross symbol ) is @xmath8015 for the 18 min sequence . in general , these localized brightenings / uds move from the tip / end of one filament onto the flank of another .",
    "this motion is continued till they can no longer be distinguished from the background .",
    "the dark filaments usually maintain their form during the motion of the uds after which they can either diffuse or break up into even smaller dark segments .",
    "\\(b ) _ light bridges : _",
    "in addition to uds , sunspot umbrae often exhibit light bridges ( lbs ) .",
    "these can be broadly classified into two categories , namely - strong and faint @xcite .",
    "while the former split the umbra into individual cores and represent an abrupt change in the umbral morphology , the latter are usually less than 1@xmath16 in width and are composed of a chain of uds .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ umb ] shows the umbra to be devoid of any large scale structuring , but figure  [ lb ] indicates a faint lb near the right - hand side of the umbra , that is nearly horizontally orientated above an umbral dark core .",
    "the image is an average of 120 filtergrams covering a 50 min duration .",
    "the lb consists of several bright grains resembling uds whose width is @xmath3023 and is close to the resolution limit of _ hinode_. the average grain spacing on the lb is estimated to be 025 while the length of the lb is nearly 3.8@xmath16 .",
    "this section describes the physical properties of uds which were determined from the time sequence of the uncorrected as well as corrected blue continuum image sequences . identifying and tracking of uds involves the following steps    [ mlt ]    1 .   _ defining the umbra - penumbra boundary _ : the sequence of corrected images are added to obtain a mean image . after smoothing the mean image using a 11@xmath711 pixel boxcar , the umbra - penumbra boundary is defined by a single continuous contour corresponding to an intensity of 0.3@xmath1 .",
    "this contour is used to construct a binary mask which allowed us to extract the umbral region from individual images .",
    "the identification of uds was carried out using a 2d mlt ( multi level tracking ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) algorithm that has been described by @xcite for detecting umbral dots .",
    "the algorithm identifies objects at different intensity levels starting from the highest level and tagging them uniquely while progressing to lower intensities , till the minimum level is reached .",
    "the number of objects ( nos ) detected depends on the number of levels ( nls ) defined .",
    "the latter was chosen by implementing the algorithm for different levels and counting the total nos detected .",
    "for both the un and cr images , the nos increase exponentially with the nls .",
    "a non - linear least square fit provided an optimal value of 33 and 25 intensity levels for the un and cr images respectively .",
    "the above values correspond to the knee of the best fit .",
    "3 .   _ defining the background image _ : the thin plate spline technique @xcite was employed to construct the background umbral image , i.e. the intensity distribution in the absence of uds .",
    "each ud is defined by the intensity contour corresponding to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 refer to the maximum / peak and background intensity respectively .",
    "figure  [ mlt ] depicts the functionality of the algorithm based on 3 levels for an arbitrary distribution of features . for each ud",
    ", the following quantities are determined : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the effective diameter @xmath21 expressed in km , is calculated as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the total number of pixels .",
    "in addition , the spatial location of the maximum intensity ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) is also noted .",
    "this information is required to track the uds in the image sequence . before saving the above information for each",
    "ud , the routine also verifies if the uds are separated from the umbra - penumbra boundary .",
    "only those features which are at least 2 pixels inward from the edge of the umbral mask are saved and considered for analysis .",
    "the fraction of objects that did not get filtered using the above criteria is less than 5% .",
    "4 .   _ tracking the uds in time _ :",
    "each ud is identified in the successive frame if @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 are at the most 1 pixel apart ( where @xmath30 refers to the frame index ) .",
    "the condition of 1 pixel separation is to ensure that the horizontal speed of the ud does not exceed 1.5 km  s@xmath2 which is obtained from the spatial sampling of 005 and a cadence of 26 s. if an ud can not be identified in the current frame the tracking is extended to 2 successive frames .",
    "if this also fails , the tracking is terminated .",
    "once tracking is completed , the following additional properties are determined from the ud trajectories : lifetime ( @xmath31 ) , horizontal speed ( @xmath32 ) , birth - death distance ( @xmath33 ) and trajectory length ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the effective diameter as well as the mean , maximum and ratio of maximum - to - background intensities are averaged over the trajectory of the ud .",
    "the horizontal velocity is calculated as the ratio of the trajectory length and the lifetime .",
    "6 .   categorizing uds into peripheral and central",
    "is carried out using a second boundary that lies @xmath308 inward from the original umbral mask .",
    "uds which originate in between these two contours are labeled as peripheral and the rest as central .",
    "figure  [ histo ] shows the histogram of the various physical properties of all uds ( central and peripheral ) whose lifetime exceeds 50 s ( 2 frames ) .",
    "these uds constitute @xmath895% of the total number of objects detected and tracked in both time sequences .",
    "the histograms have been normalized to unity for comparison .",
    "the bin size of the quantities corresponding to the un and cr data is identical .",
    "we now turn to the quantitative differences between the physical properties of uds derived from the uncorrected and corrected sets and whose mean values are summarized in table  [ tab ] .",
    "+    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we employ a 2 hr 20 min time sequence of high resolution blue continuum filtergrams of the sunspot in noaa ar 10944 from _ hinode _ sot to determine the properties of umbral dots and analyze the umbral fine structure after careful removal of instrumental stray light .",
    "the motivation of our study stems from the fact that stray light reduces image contrast which could influence the photometric and geometric properties of umbral features .",
    "after deconvolving the filtergrams with an instrumental psf , whose wings describe the scattered light in the telescope , we find that the @xmath0 contrast of the images increases by a factor of 1.45 .",
    "in addition , the mean umbral intensity decreases by @xmath3 17% .    with scattered light accounted for ,",
    "one is able to identify short filamentary structures resembling penumbrae but well separated from the umbra - penumbra boundary .",
    "the features consist of a dark filament with bright filaments / grains adjacent to it .",
    "the width of the dark filament is at the resolution limit of _ hinode _ , suggesting that these structures are largely unresolved .",
    "their lifetimes are of the order of 10 - 20 min during which bright grains can transit from one filament to another remaining close to the dark filament .",
    "the existence of similar features have already been reported by @xcite based on ground based observations from larger telescopes as well as from numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "we however , do not find sub - structures in uds namely , the dark lanes , which represent hot convective plumes , since they are still below the detection capability of _ hinode_. the observations of @xcite are reminiscent of fragmenting light bridges that often exhibit dark cores along their axis @xcite .",
    "various physical properties of umbral dots were determined after they were identified in individual images and tracked in time . to that end , a multi - level tracking algorithm was applied to both the uncorrected and corrected image sequences .",
    "the following properties were analyzed : mean intensity ( @xmath20 ) , maximum intensity ( @xmath18 ) , ratio of maximum - to - background intensity ( @xmath35 ) , effective diameter ( @xmath21 ) , horizontal speed ( @xmath32 ) , lifetime ( @xmath31 ) , birth - death distance ( @xmath33 ) and trajectory length ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the mean value of the above quantities derived from the stray light corrected image sequence are 0.24@xmath1 , 0.29@xmath1 , 2.5 , 272 km , 0.45 km  s@xmath2 , 8.4 min , 112 km and 221 km respectively .",
    "the distribution of the values describing the photometric and geometric properties is more strongly affected by the presence of stray light while it is less severe in the case of the kinematic parameters .",
    "the time sequence of corrected images was also used to determine if umbral dots prefer to appear or disappear at specific locations in the umbra .",
    "furthermore , any specific time delay or a set of time delays associated with subsequent emergence / disappearance was also determined .",
    "the events which were sorted as birth - birth , birth - death - birth and death - death do not have a unique time delay with a majority of events in either group having a value varying between 45 - 50 min .",
    "these values are also insensitive to the minimum lifetime of umbral dots .",
    "the spatial locations where these events occur are scattered in the umbra and in general do not highlight a specific pattern .",
    "in addition , there are several pixels where events from either class can overlap .",
    "this would suggest that umbral dots tend to reappear or emerge from the location of disappearance of former umbral dots .",
    "table  [ compare ] gives mean values of a few properties obtained previously from _",
    "hinode _ , ground - based observations and numerical simulations .",
    "the values obtained from the uncorrected sequence are in good agreement with those reported by @xcite for the same data set described in this paper , although they employed a different identification routine . on the other hand , the corresponding values obtained from the stray light corrected images are consistent with @xcite .",
    "the ratio of maximum - to - background intensity ( @xmath35 ) is particularly in good agreement with those obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there appears to be some differences between the results derived from numerical simulations by @xcite and @xcite which show uds to be larger , slower and long - lived than those retrieved from observations .",
    "the deviations between the two sets of simulations could be attributed to the boundary conditions and treatment of numerical diffusivities @xcite . in the case of observations , there is general consensus that uds are typically 250 km in diameter and have lifetimes of 10 min and horizontal speeeds of 450 m  s@xmath2 .",
    "another point of disagreement between simulations and observations is the ubiquitous presence of uds in the former that do not give any indication of structuring in the umbra , i.e. faint light bridges and umbral dark cores .    with the exception of intensity vs diameter , none of the ud properties are well correlated with each other @xcite . in simulations ,",
    "the correlation coefficient is nearly 0.6 but can vary between 0.02 and 0.3 depending on the sample of uds taken from relatively bright locations in the umbra @xcite .",
    "the monotonicity seen in simulations , exists with a significant scatter between the intensity and diameter of uds .",
    "the differences between observations and simulations , needs to be addressed with complementary polarimetric observations at high spatial resolution ( @xmath36015 ) which could provide additional constraints for mhd models .",
    "this is necessary for determining the physical mechanisms driving uds and their kinematics , for which instruments such as the crisp @xcite and the gfpi ( gregor fabry - p@xmath37rot interferometer ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will be crucial .",
