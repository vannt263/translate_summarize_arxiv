    "weakly - interacting electrons in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) periodic potential are well - described by landau - fermi liquid theory  @xcite , in which the free electrons of a fermi gas become dressed quasiparticles with renormalised dynamical properties .",
    "conversely , in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) limit a tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) is formed  @xcite , where single - particle excitations are replaced by highly correlated collective excitations .",
    "so far , it has proved difficult to interpolate theoretically between these two regimes , either by strengthening electron - electron ( @xmath3-@xmath3 ) interactions in 3d , or by incorporating weak transverse coupling into 1d models  @xcite .",
    "the invariable presence of disorder in real materials places further demands on theory , particularly in the description of ordered electronic ground states .",
    "q1d systems such as nanowire ropes , filamentary networks or single crystals with uniaxial anisotropy therefore represent an opportunity to experimentally probe what theories aspire to model : strongly correlated electrons subject to disorder in a highly anisotropic 3d environment .    physical properties of q1d materials may vary considerably with temperature .",
    "tll theory is expected to be valid at elevated temperatures , since electrons can not hop coherently perpendicular to the high - symmetry axis and q1d systems behave as decoupled arrays of 1d filaments .",
    "phase - coherent single - particle hopping can only occur below temperature @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the transverse hopping integral ) , at which a dimensional crossover to an anisotropic quasi - three - dimensional ( q3d ) electron liquid is anticipated  @xcite .",
    "the properties of such q3d liquids remain largely unknown , especially the role of electronic correlations in determining the ground state . at low temperature ,",
    "a tll is unstable to either density wave ( dw ) or superconducting fluctuations , depending on whether the @xmath3-@xmath3 interaction is repulsive ( due to coulomb forces ) or attractive ( from electron - phonon coupling ) .",
    "following dimensional crossover , the influence of such interactions in the q3d state is unclear . as an example , electrical transport in the tll state of the q1d purple bronze li@xmath6mo@xmath2o@xmath7",
    "is dominated by repulsive @xmath3-@xmath3 interactions  @xcite , yet a superconducting transition occurs below 1.9  k.    disorder adds further complication to q1d materials due to its tendency to localise electrons at low temperature . for dimensionality @xmath8 , localisation occurs for any non - zero disorder ; in contrast , for @xmath9 a critical disorder is required and a mobility edge separates extended from localised states .",
    "the question of whether a mobility edge can form in q1d materials after crossover to a q3d liquid state is open , as is the microscopic nature of the localised phase .",
    "disorder also renormalises @xmath3-@xmath3 interactions , leading to a dynamic amplification of the coulomb repulsion  @xcite and a weaker enhancement of phonon - mediated @xmath3-@xmath3 attraction , i.e. cooper pairing  @xcite .",
    "we therefore anticipate that disorder should strongly suppress superconductivity in q1d materials , unless the coulomb interaction is unusually weak or screened .    in this work ,",
    "we show that the q1d superconductor na@xmath1mo@xmath2se@xmath2 provides a unique environment in which to study the interplay between dimensionality , electronic correlations and disorder .",
    "although na@xmath1mo@xmath2se@xmath2 is metallic at room temperature , the presence of na vacancy disorder leads to electron localisation and a divergent resistivity @xmath10 at low temperature , prior to a superconducting transition .",
    "in contrast with all other known superconductors , the onset temperature for superconducting fluctuations @xmath11 is positively correlated with the level of disorder .",
    "normal - state electrical transport measurements also display signatures of an attractive @xmath3-@xmath3 interaction , which is consistent with disorder - enhanced superconductivity .",
    "a plausible explanation for these phenomena is an intrinsic screening of the long - range coulomb repulsion in na@xmath1mo@xmath2se@xmath2 , arising from the high polarisability of disordered q1d materials .",

    "a small paramagnetic contribution also emerges in the dc magnetisation below @xmath30 and rises non - linearly with @xmath49 ( supplementary fig .  6 ) .",
    "similar behaviour has previously been attributed to a progressive crossover from pauli to curie paramagnetism due to electron localisation ( supplementary note iv ) .",

    "we also point out that the finite - size effects which influence critical temperatures in granular  @xcite or nanomaterials  @xcite are not relevant in na@xmath1mo@xmath2se@xmath2 : quantum confinement is absent in homogeneously - disordered crystalline superconductors and hence no peaks form in @xmath23 .",
    "these mechanisms are discussed in detail in supplementary note ix .    in summary , we have presented experimental evidence for the enhancement of superconductivity by disorder in na@xmath1mo@xmath2se@xmath2 .",
    "the combination of q1d crystal symmetry ( and the associated dimensional crossover ) , disorder and incommensurate band filling in this material poses a challenge to existing 1d",
    "/ q1d theoretical models .",
    "although the normal - state electrical resistivity of na@xmath1mo@xmath2se@xmath2 is compatible with theories for disordered 1d systems with attractive electron - electron interactions , we establish several unusual low - temperature transport properties which deserve future attention .",
    "these include a resistivity which diverges following a q1d vrh law for all levels of disorder , the existence of a critical disorder or q1d mobility edge where @xmath53 , and a strongly frequency - dependent conductivity @xmath93 in crystals with super - critical disorder . at temperature @xmath11 ,",
    "1d superconducting fluctuations develop , and a phase - coherent ground state is established via coupling between 1d filaments at lower temperature .",
    "as the disorder rises , @xmath11 increases : in our most - disordered crystals , the survival of superconducting fluctuations in magnetic fields at least four times larger than the pauli limit suggests that the pairing energy may be unusually large .",
    "we conclude that deliberately introducing disorder into q1d crystals represents a new path towards engineering correlated electron materials , in remarkable contrast with the conventional blend of strong coulomb repulsion and a high density of states . beyond enhancing superconductivity , the ability to simultaneously modulate band filling , disorder and dimensionality",
    "promises a high level of control over emergent order , including density waves and magnetic phases . more generally , na@xmath1mo@xmath2se@xmath2 and other similar interrupted strand materials may be ideal environments in which to study the evolution of many - body electron localisation beyond the non - interacting anderson limit",
    "* * crystal growth and initial characterisation**a series of na@xmath1mo@xmath2se@xmath2 crystals was grown using a solid - state synthesis procedure .",
    "the precursor materials were mose@xmath61 , inse , mo and nacl , all in powder form . before use",
    ", the mo powder was reduced under h@xmath61 gas flowing at 1000@xmath22c for ten hours , in order to eliminate any trace of oxygen .",
    "the mose@xmath61 was prepared by reacting se with h@xmath61-reduced mo in a ratio 2:1 inside a purged , evacuated and flame - baked silica tube ( with a residual pressure of @xmath31  10@xmath94  mbar argon ) , which was then heated to @xmath31  700@xmath22c for two days .",
    "inse was synthesised from elemental in and se in an evacuated sealed silica tube at 800@xmath22c for 1 day .",
    "powder samples of na@xmath1mo@xmath2se@xmath2 were prepared in two steps .",
    "firstly , in@xmath61mo@xmath2se@xmath2 was synthesised from a stoichiometric mixture of inse , mose@xmath61 and mo , heated to 1000@xmath22c in an evacuated sealed silica tube for 36 hours . secondly ,",
    "an ion exchange reaction of in@xmath61mo@xmath2se@xmath2 with nacl was performed at 800@xmath22c , using a 10% nacl excess to ensure total exchange as described in reference  @xcite .",
    "all starting reagents were found to be monophase on the basis of their powder x - ray diffraction patterns , acquired using a d8 bruker advance diffractometer equipped with a lynxeye detector ( cuk@xmath95 radiation ) .",
    "furthermore , in order to avoid any contamination by oxygen and moisture , the starting reagents were kept and handled in a purified argon - filled glovebox .    to synthesise single crystals , a na@xmath1mo@xmath2se@xmath2 powder sample ( of mass @xmath31  5  g ) was cold - pressed and loaded into a molybdenum crucible , which had previously been outgassed at 1500@xmath22c for 15  minutes under a dynamic vacuum of @xmath31  10@xmath96  mbar .",
    "the mo crucible was subsequently sealed under a low argon pressure using an arc - welding system .",
    "the na@xmath1mo@xmath2se@xmath2 powder charge was heated at a rate of 300@xmath22c / hour up to 1750@xmath22c , held at this temperature for 3 hours , then cooled at 100@xmath22c / hour down to 1000@xmath22c and finally cooled naturally to room temperature within the furnace .",
    "crystals obtained using this procedure have a needle - like shape with length up to 4 mm and a hexagonal cross section with typical diameter @xmath97  150  @xmath72 m .",
    "initial semi - quantitative microanalyses using a jeol jsm 6400 scanning electron microscope equipped with an oxford inca energy - dispersive - type x - ray ( edx ) spectrometer indicated that the na contents ranged between 1.7 and 2 , i.e. up to 15% deficiency . the na deficiency results from the high temperatures used during the crystal growth process coupled with the small size of the na ion : it can not be accurately controlled within the conditions necessary for crystal growth .",
    "since in@xmath61mo@xmath2se@xmath2 is known to be superconducting below 2.85  k  @xcite , it is important to consider the possibility of in contamination in our samples .",
    "the na / in ion exchange technique used during synthesis is known to be highly efficient  @xcite and in@xmath61mo@xmath2se@xmath2 decomposes above 1300@xmath22c , well below our crystal growth temperature ( 1750@xmath22c ) .",
    "this precludes the presence of any superconducting in@xmath61mo@xmath2se@xmath2 ( or in - rich ( in , na)@xmath61mo@xmath2se@xmath2 ) filaments in our crystals .",
    "diffuse x - ray scattering measurements accordingly reveal none of the huang scattering or disk - like bragg reflections which would be produced by such filaments .",
    "furthermore , edx spectrometry is unable to detect any in content in our crystals , while inductively - coupled plasma mass spectrometry indicates a typical in residual of less than 0.01% , i.e. @xmath69  0.0002 in atoms per unit cell .",
    "the electronic properties of na@xmath1mo@xmath2se@xmath2 crystals will remain unaffected by such a tiny in residual in solid solution .    * * electrical transport measurements**before all measurements , the as - grown crystal surfaces were briefly cleaned with dilute hydrochloric acid ( to remove any residue from the mo crucible and hence minimise the contact resistance ) , followed by distilled water , acetone and ethanol .",
    "four au contact pads were sputtered onto the upper surface and sides of each crystal using an al foil mask ; 50  @xmath72 m au wires were then glued to these pads using silver - loaded epoxy cured at 70@xmath22c ( epotek e4110 ) .",
    "especial care was taken to thoroughly coat each end of the crystal with epoxy , to ensure that the measurement current passed through the entire crystal .",
    "all contacts were verified to be ohmic at room temperature before and after each series of transport measurements , and at @xmath98  k after cooling .",
    "typical contact resistances were of the order of 2  @xmath99 at 300  k. the transverse conductivity @xmath100 was estimated at room temperature using a four - probe technique , with contacts on opposite hexagonal faces of a single crystal .",
    "the temperature dependence of the transverse resistivity @xmath101 has never been accurately measured in @xmath12mo@xmath2se@xmath2 due to the exceptionally large anisotropies , small crystal diameters and high fragility , even in the least anisotropic tl@xmath61mo@xmath2se@xmath2 which forms the largest crystals  @xcite .",
    "low - frequency four - wire ac conductivity measurements were performed in two separate cryogen - free systems : a variable temperature cryostat and a dilution refrigerator , both of which may be used in conjunction with a superconducting vector magnet .",
    "the ac conductivity was measured using a keithley 6100 current source , a stanford srs850 lock - in amplifier with input impedance 10  m@xmath99 and ( for low resistances , i.e. weakly - disordered samples ) a stanford sr550 preamplifier with input impedance 100  m@xmath99 .",
    "data from several crystals were cross - checked using a quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms ) with the standard inbuilt ac transport hardware : both methods generate identical , reproducible data . with the exception of the frequency - dependence studies in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , all the transport data which we present in our manuscript are acquired with an ac excitation frequency of 1  hz , i.e. we are measuring in the dc limit . at 1  hz",
    ", the phase angle remained zero at all temperatures in all crystals .",
    "therefore , no extrinsic capacitance effects are present in our data .",
    "the typical resistance of a weakly disordered crystal lies in the 1 - 10  @xmath99 range . in contrast , the absolute resistances of crystals @xmath102 at @xmath11 are 41.9  k@xmath99 , 33.7k@xmath99 and 27.6k@xmath99 respectively : the crystal diameter increases from @xmath102 , thus explaining the rise in resistivity despite a fall in resistance .",
    "these values remain much smaller than our lock - in amplifier input impedance , ruling out any current leakage in highly disordered crystals .",
    "our measurement current @xmath103  10  @xmath72a leads to a maximum power dissipation @xmath104  @xmath72w .",
    "this is negligible compared with the @xmath31  2  mw cooling power at 2k on our cryostat cold finger and we may hence rule out any sample heating effects in our data .",
    "we acquire transverse magnetotransport data ( figs .",
    "[ fig3]c - e ,  [ fig5]d - g ) with the magnetic field perpendicular to both the @xmath17 axis and the crystal faces , i.e. at 30@xmath22 to the hexagonal @xmath105 axis .",
    "q1d bechgaard salts and blue / purple bronzes exhibit monoclinic crystal symmetry , and hence strong anisotropies along all three crystallographic axes .",
    "in contrast , @xmath12mo@xmath2se@xmath2 crystallise in a hexagonal lattice : any azimuthal ( @xmath106 ) anisotropy in na@xmath1mo@xmath2se@xmath2 will therefore reflect this hexagonal symmetry . in tl@xmath61mo@xmath2se@xmath2 , this anisotropy has been variously reported to be small or entirely absent : it is at least an order of magnitude lower than the polar anisotropy at low temperature  @xcite .",
    "our conclusions regarding the reduced low temperature anisotropy in na@xmath1mo@xmath2se@xmath2 are therefore robust .    in common with",
    "most highly one - dimensional materials , na@xmath1mo@xmath2se@xmath2 crystals are extremely fragile , with a tendency to split into a forest of tangled fibres if mishandled .",
    "the crystals therefore exhibit a finite experimental lifetime , with thermal cycling from 2  k to room temperature presenting a particular risk to their structural integrity : this explains why we were unable to obtain complete data - sets in crystals @xmath27-@xmath28 ( the magnetoresistance @xmath59 at high temperature in crystal @xmath51 and @xmath107 in crystal @xmath28 are missing , for example ) .",
