    "the notion of quantum entanglement has been proved to be at the core of many quantum phenomena , such as teleportation , dense coding or cryptography . moreover ,",
    "it is a key ingredient to the computational power of quantum devices .",
    "entanglement expresses inseparability , that is unusual correlations between the subsystems of a quantum system which can not be explained by classical , non - quantum , models .",
    "hence , a central question in the theory of quantum information and computation is detecting the presence and measuring the amount of entanglement present in a given quantum system .",
    "one of the most efficient tools in detecting entanglement is the positive partial transpose @xmath0 criterion @xcite .",
    "it states that if a quantum state is separable , then the partial transpose with respect to one of the subsystems is positive - semidefinite .",
    "it represents a necessary condition for separability and more often it is applied as a tool to detect entanglement : if the partial transpose of a given state is not positive - semidefinite , then the state is entangled .",
    "as the partial transposition criterion is obtained by applying the transposition operator over the second subsystem , it raised the question of finding other positive maps @xmath1 with the property @xmath2 is not positive - semidefinite , for some entangled bipartite states @xmath3 .",
    "one needs to look for such maps @xmath1 in the class of positive , but not completely positive applications . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors show the following converse : a quantum state @xmath4 is separable if and only if @xmath5 is positive - semidefinite for _ all _ positive maps @xmath6 and all positive integers @xmath7 ( actually , @xmath8 suffices , see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2 ) ) , where @xmath9 is the identity map .",
    "thus , each fixed positive map yields a necessary condition for separability ; in other words , each fixed positive map yields an entanglement criterion .",
    "note that these conditions ( resp .",
    "criteria ) become trivial for completely positive maps .",
    "a possible choice of the positive map @xmath10 is the _ reduction map _",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 and the corresponding separability test is called _",
    "reduction @xmath13 criterion _",
    "the reduction criterion is weaker than the @xmath14 criterion : if a state violates the reduction criterion , then it also violates the @xmath14 criterion @xcite .",
    "conversely , there exist states ( some entangled werner states @xcite ) which satisfy the reduction criterion but violate the @xmath14 criterion .",
    "the two criteria are equivalent if the subsystem on which the reduction map is applied is a qubit @xcite .",
    "both ppt and reduction criteria are efficient theoretical tools in detecting quantum entanglement , although the former presents the obvious advantage of a more elegant form , which in addition requires less computations . in practice however , since impure entanglement is produced , the concept of distillation was introduced as the process to produce a pure maximally entangled state by local quantum operations and classical communication , from many copies of an arbitrary entangled state ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "horodecki proved that a ppt state is necessarily undistillable @xcite .",
    "this result sheds light on the fact that in high dimensions there are entangled states which can not be distilled .",
    "these states , namely ppt entangled states , are called _ bound entangled states _ , contrary to entangled states which can be distilled .",
    "it is possible to show that reduction criterion and entanglement distillation are connected : any state which violates the reduction criterion is distillable ; conversely , if a state can be distilled by a certain protocol , then the state violates the reduction criterion @xcite .",
    "this result justifies the use of the reduction criterion , even if , from a purely entanglement - detection perspective , it is weaker than the ppt criterion .",
    "the separability problem was also approached by studying the class of _ absolutely separable states _ ( asep ) , i.e.   states that remain separable under any global unitary transformation @xcite , that means to find conditions on the spectrum that characterize absolutely separable states ( constraints on the eigenvalues of a state @xmath3 guaranteeing that @xmath3 is separable with respect to any decomposition of the corresponding product tensor space @xcite ) .",
    "this problem was first fully solved in the qubit - qubit case in @xcite , and then in the qubit - qudit case in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is known that there is an euclidean ball of known radius centered at the maximally - mixed state @xmath15 such that every state within this ball is separable @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , meaning that any state within this ball is actually absolutely separable .",
    "however , there exist absolutely separable states outside of this ball ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix b ) . in analogy",
    "to absolutely separable states , states which remain @xmath16 under any global unitary transformation are called _ absolutely @xmath14 states _ ( @xmath17 ) /_absolutely @xmath18 states _",
    "( @xmath19 ) @xcite .",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions on the spectrum of appt - states are given in @xcite , in the form of a finite set ( albeit exponentially large in the dimension ) of linear matrix inequalities .",
    "for the case of ared - states , necessary and sufficient conditions are given in the form of a infinite family of linear inequalities , which the spectrum has to verify @xcite .",
    "in this paper we approach the problem of separability and absolute - separability from a different perspective .",
    "we aim to derive _ thresholds _ for the reduction and absolute reduction criteria and to give a complete picture of threshold points for the class of entanglement criteria .",
    "the threshold point is defined in the following sense : given a random mixed state @xmath20 , obtained by partial tracing over @xmath21 a uniformly distributed , pure quantum state @xmath22 , where the @xmath23-dimensional space is treated like an inaccessible environment , we ask for the probability that the state satisfies an entanglement criterion . when one ( or both ) of the system dimensions @xmath24 and @xmath25 are large , a _ threshold phenomenon _ occurs : if @xmath26 , for some constant @xmath27 , or @xmath23 is fixed , then there is a _",

    "the threshold phenomenon was introduced by aubrun to study the ppt criterion @xcite .",
    "our main contribution presented in this paper is to complete the computation of the thresholds for the reduction criterion given in @xcite and to derive the threshold for the absolute reduction criterion , in different asymptotic regimes .",
