    "the strong , @xmath210  jy , flat - spectrum radio source pks  1830@xmath0211 was first suggested to be a gravitational lens by rao and subrahmanyan ( 1988 ) .",
    "three years later the source was identified as an einstein ring / gravitational lens ( @xcite ) and remains the brightest such object found in the radio sky by almost two orders of magnitude .",
    "while the interpretation of the source as a gravitational lens beyond the galaxy ( @xcite ) is secure , it lies in a crowded and heavily obscured field close to the galactic center and so far all efforts to identify optical or infra - red counterparts either for the lensing galaxy or the lensed source have been unsuccessful ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in particular , the failure of optical measurements to furnish any redshifts has driven the search for these critical parameters into the radio spectrum .",
    "the symmetric morphology of the source , comprising two compact , flat - spectrum components of similar brightness located on opposite sides of a 1 arcsec ring , immediately suggests a close alignment of the lensed source behind the lensing mass .",
    "moreover , there is evidence of unusually high rotation measures in some parts of the source which argues that the lensing galaxy is probably a gas - rich spiral ( @xcite ) , and suggests the possibility of detecting molecular absorption .",
    "accordingly , we undertook a survey on 1995 june 10 and 11 for redshifted hi  and oh absorption with the parkes 64  m radio telescope , as part of a cooperative observation programme with the project phoenix group ( @xcite ) . the project phoenix receiver and signal processing equipment",
    "were used to cover a frequency range of 995 to 1675  mhz , nicely complementing a previous absorption search over the frequency range 400@xmath01000  mhz at green bank , which yielded a negative result ( @xcite ) .",
    "our observations excluded the two intervals 1535 - 1635  mhz and 1165 - 1175  mhz because of excessive interference .",
    "although interference of both terrestrial and satellite origin was profuse over most of the remaining band , it was generally of very narrow bandwidth and easily recognizable , and did not greatly impede the search .",
    "we detected only a single absorption feature with two sub - components of similar amplitude , centered at 1191.1  mhz with an overall line width of approximately 50  km / s ( figure 1a ) .",
    "the absorption feature was detected with comparable strength on two consecutive days .",
    "on the second day , observations of pks  1830@xmath0211 were bracketed with those of pks  1921@xmath0293 , a nearby source of similar flux density .",
    "no evidence of the absorption feature was seen in this comparison source .",
    "vlbi observations were made on 1995 september 18 with four telescopes of the australian long baseline array ( lba ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; hobart , coonabarabran , parkes and five antennas of the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) acting as a phased array .",
    "s2 recorders ( @xcite ) were used , operating in dual polarization ( lcp and rcp ) with 4  mhz bandwidth centered on 1191.0  mhz . correlated visibilities between all six antennas of the atca",
    "were also recorded to produce an improved total - power spectrum ( figure 1b ) .",
    "pks  1830@xmath0211 was observed over an 8 hour period interleaved with a bandpass calibrator .",
    "the vlbi data were correlated at the atnf vlbi correlator ( @xcite ) .",
    "no correlated flux was detected on the long ( @xmath3 ) baselines to hobart owing to interstellar scattering at this frequency ( @xcite ) .",
    "our vlbi image in figure 2 is similar to an earlier 2.3 ghz vlbi image ( @xcite ) and shows the two compact components of pks  1830@xmath0211 , but little of the low brightness ring which is heavily resolved at this resolution .",
    "figure 2 also shows the absorption spectrum of each component , clearly demonstrating that the two velocity components of the absorption system obscure different parts of the source .",
    "the low velocity component is also heavily resolved and therefore must be obscuring only the extended ring while the high velocity component is resolved only partially and covers the ne component but is weak or absent in the sw component .",
    "this , together with a comparison of the relative optical depths in figures 1 and 2 , also allows us to infer that the angular size of the absorbing features must be greater than a few tenths of an arcsecond .",
    "a molecular absorption system at a redshift of 0.88582 has already been found in this source ( @xcite ) , and is argued to arise in an intervening galaxy rather than in the lensed object . this has been confirmed by observations with the bima array which have spatially resolved the @xmath4 absorption ( @xcite ) .",
    "we believe that our detection constitutes a second absorption system in pks  1830@xmath0211 and is probably hi  absorption in an intervening galaxy at a redshift of @xmath5 . in support of this",
    "we note that there are no catalogued lines near 2246  mhz , the rest frequency of our observed absorption if it belongs to the @xmath4 system .",
    "further , we observed the bright galactic sources sgr  b2 , ori  kl and irc  10216 with the 26  m telescope at hobart to search for a possible unlisted transition at this frequency , and detected nothing above an rms noise level of @xmath20.1% of the continuum . moreover , our detection appears to lie mainly in front of the ne component whilst the @xmath6 absorption is confined to the sw component ( @xcite ; frye _ et al .",
    "our absorption feature also displays velocity structure not seen in the @xmath4 absorption profiles .",
    "the interpretation of the feature in figure 1 as oh is unlikely for two reasons .",
    "first , the spectra show none of the ` satellite ' profiles typical of oh absorption and second , we see no evidence of absorption at 1016  mhz corresponding to hi  at the same redshift , which we would expect to be clearly visible .",
    "neither can this be an hydrogen recombination line as we would have detected many such lines across the band and did not .",
    "t. wiklind and f. combes ( 1996b ) report no evidence of molecular absorption in pks  1830@xmath0211 at @xmath1 in their sest observations .",
    "however this is not totally unexpected as the total solid angle subtended by the source at these high frequencies is small ( @xmath21mas@xmath7 ) and hence the probability of intersecting a dense molecular cloud along the line of sight is presumably small .",
    "the absorption feature seen in figure 1 is very similar in both width and column density to that found in the lens system 0218@xmath8357 ( @xcite ) , which is convincingly argued to arise from hi  absorption in the lensing galaxy , probably a spiral galaxy seen nearly edge - on .",
    "we favour a similar interpretation for the absorption in pks  1830@xmath0211 , with the line of sight intercepting several hi  clouds in a gas - rich galaxy at @xmath1 .",
    "the two features seen in the absorption profile may well correspond to two spiral arms of @xmath2kpc scale seen nearly superposed , both of which partially obscure the ring and one of which obscures the ne compact component .",
    "such a picture is entirely consistent with the properties of hi  clouds and galaxy dynamics observed within our own galaxy .",
    "independent evidence for a considerable amount of material along the line of sight is suggested by the unusually high rotation measure seen in the ne component ( nair _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the observed downturn in total flux density of pks  1830@xmath0211 below 1  ghz ( @xcite ) implies significant free - free absorbing material obscuring the non - compact structure , which has a steep spectrum and can not be synchrotron self - absorbed .",
    "while the hi  absorption toward pks  1830@xmath0211 indicates the presence of a galaxy at @xmath1 , this does not infallibly imply _ a priori _ that gravitational lensing is taking place at this redshift , any more than it does for the @xmath4 system . that lensing of some kind is taking place is beyond dispute given , for example , the near - simultaneous variation seen in the flux density variations of the two compact components ( @xcite ) , apparently separated by more than @xmath9kpc : a most improbable effect in any non - lensed interpretation .",
    "it seems almost certain therefore , that at least one of the two redshift systems at @xmath1 and @xmath4 is partaking in the lensing and there is further evidence that both systems may be involved .",
    "firstly , the lens evinces a quite paradoxical appearance at high resolution .",
    "vlbi images made over a 3 year period ( @xcite ; @xcite ) show the sw component to be unresolved at @xmath2milliarcsecond resolution while the ne component shows a well resolved linear structure .",
    "this difference in morphology of the two components is too long - lived to be due to the difference in propagation times to the two components , estimated to be no more than a few tens of days ( nair _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the results presented here suggest that the second absorption system at @xmath1 may be responsible for this striking disparity in the two images by causing additional lensing distortion of the ne image , thus forming a compound gravitational lens .",
    "the alternative explanation that scattering by a high gas concentration in front of the ne component is causing the additional linear structure is ruled out as there is no @xmath10 dependence on the length of this feature in the 5 and 15  ghz images ( @xcite and @xcite respectively ) .",
    "secondly , attempts to model pks  1830@xmath0211 with a single , simple gravitational potential have achieved only modest success , and have produced markedly different models .",
    "the models developed by nair _",
    "et  al . _",
    "( 1993 ) and by kochanek _",
    "et  al . _",
    "( 1992 ) , for example , differ in a number of material respects , not least in the time delay between the two compact components , which has the opposite sign in the nair _",
    "_ model to that inferred from the kochanek _",
    "_ model .",
    "the presence of a second lensing galaxy in this system adds an extra layer of complexity to any lensing model .",
    "this galaxy is likely to influence the light travel time through the ne component and so must be considered before @xmath11 can be determined from the time delay .",
    "it is important therefore to estimate the mass and position of the @xmath1 system .",
    "we are unable to obtain this information from our data .",
    "however polarization images of pks  1830@xmath0211 at two or more frequencies to map rotation measure would help delineate the intervening material .",
    "the australia telescope is operated as a national facility by csiro . j.e.j.l and c.j.p .",
    "are supported by australian postgraduate research awards .",
    "this research was carried out in part at the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract to the nasa .",
