    "the stellar mass and the current star formation rate ( sfr ) are two of the most fundamental physical properties of a galaxy .",
    "the sfr normalized by stellar mass , i.e. , the specific star formation rate ( ssfr , @xcite ) , in addition serves as a rough indicator of a galaxy s star formation ( sf ) history . to infer properties such as stellar mass and sfr from observed quantities , stellar populations and the effects of dust attenuation",
    "are modeled and compared to galaxy spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) and/or the integrated photometry .",
    "pioneering work to derive physical properties of galaxies from their integrated light ( e.g. , @xcite ) paved the way for the development of more advanced stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models in the 1980s ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these conventional models were replaced by isochrone synthesis in the following decade ( e.g. , @xcite ) , culminating in modern , high - resolution models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "sps models are the basis for widely used `` simple '' relations for inferring the stellar mass from broad - band optical colors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these relations are by necessity averaged over galaxy populations and use simplified assumptions , so they can not take into account variations in sf history , dust attenuation or stellar metallicity .",
    "simple relations are also used for inferring the sfr from uv or @xmath3  luminosity @xcite . in addition to again using average assumptions , these luminosities first need to be corrected for dust attenuation . for galaxies at @xmath4 , the quantities that enter these relations must be explicitly corrected to rest - frame luminosities , which requires the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a galaxy to be assumed .",
    "a more flexible and comprehensive approach is to derive physical parameters through sed fitting ( see @xcite for overview ) .",
    "sps models are used to produce a library ( a grid , in case of regular sampling intervals ) of models in which the sf history and metallicity take a range of values .",
    "model seds are further subjected to varying degrees of dust attenuation assuming some attenuation law .",
    "redshifted model fluxes ( broad - band magnitudes ) are compared to observations ( obviating a need for an explicit k - correction ) , and the best - fitting model is sought and its parameters are adopted as the parameters of the observed galaxy . unlike with simple relations , in sed fitting every observed flux plays some role in constraining all derived parameters , taking full advantage of the full set of observations .",
    "while in sed fitting the relationships between the observed and derived parameters are not explicit as with the simple relations , it should be noted that both approaches are ultimately rooted in sps models .    for stellar sed fitting to produce useful constraints on the ongoing sfr , the rest - frame uv photometry must be included .",
    "sed fitting was initially employed to derive sfrs from broad - band observations of small samples of lyman break galaxies at @xmath5 , for which the uv was redshifted to easily observed optical range @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the uv surveys carried out by _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ) satellite @xcite placed low - redshift ( @xmath6 ) galaxies within the domain of sed fitting . @xcite performed the sed fitting of low - redshift galaxies by combining the uv photometry from _ galex _  with the optical photometry from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "furthermore , they utilized a bayesian approach to sed fitting , following the methods pioneered by the max planck institute for astrophysics / johns hopkins university ( mpa / jhu ) group @xcite . unlike the traditional best - fit ( minimum @xmath7 ) approach",
    ", bayesian sed fitting determines the full probability distribution function of any parameter ( or combination of parameters ) , yielding more robust parameter characterization , along with its uncertainty ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent efforts expanded bayesian sed fitting to include thermal dust emission @xcite and star formation histories derived from cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter s07 ) performed a thorough investigation of sfrs in the local universe and showed that the uv / optical sed fitting is especially powerful for obtaining sfrs of galaxies with low ssfrs .",
    "however , s07 used an early _ galex _  data release covering only 10% of sdss area .",
    "because of its preliminary nature , the catalog of physical parameters from s07 was not released to the public .    here we present galex ",
    "sdss  wise legacy catalog ( gswlc ) of physical parameters , which builds on s07 uv / optical sed fitting efforts , but includes numerous methodological improvements , such as uv photometry corrections , flexible dust attenuation curves , and emission line corrections .",
    "many of these improvements were made possible by the use of the code investigating galaxy emission ( cigale ) .",
    "( @xcite , m.boquien et al . in prep . ) , to calculate the models and perform the sed fitting .",
    "gswlc contains sdss galaxies within the _ galex _  footprint ( regardless of the uv detection ) , covering 90% of sdss area .",
    "in addition to the stellar masses and the sfrs from the uv / optical sed fitting , gswlc also includes sfrs derived independently from _ the wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ , @xcite ) mid - infrared ( ir ) observations .",
    "community access to the catalog is provided online at http://pages.iu.edu/~salims/gswlc and from mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) .    after defining the scope and the sample of gswlc ( section [ sec : sample ] ) , we describe the input data and the process of deriving the parameters ( sections [ sec : data ] , [ sec : sed ] and [ sec : wise ] ) .",
    "the catalog is described in section [ sec : catalog ] . in section [ sec : comp ] we examine the contents of the catalog , while in section [ sec : other ] gswlc is compared to several previously published catalogs of physical properties of sdss galaxies .",
    "gswlc is built around sdss main galaxy sample ( mgs , @xcite ) , the most extensive spectroscopic survey of low - redshift ( @xmath6 ) universe .",
    "more specifically , gswlc includes all mgs - like sdss galaxies that fall within _ galex _  footprint , covering @xmath8 of sdss area , or @xmath9 sq .",
    "galaxies are kept in the sample regardless of the detection in the uv , thus retaining the optical selection .",
    "sdss and _ galex _  data were obtained through sdss casjobs sql server .",
    "the majority of low - redshift galaxies in sdss were targeted spectroscopically as part of the magnitude - limited mgs , one of the three original ( `` legacy '' ) spectroscopic surveys ( others being the luminous red galaxy , lrg , and quasar surveys ) .",
    "legacy surveys were completed in 2008 with the release of dr7 @xcite , and cover a large contiguous area in the northern galactic cap , and three separate stripes in the southern galactic cap ( figure [ fig : map ] ) .",
    "these areas lie almost entirely in the northern sky ( @xmath10 ) , and mostly at high galactic latitude ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "mgs selection algorithm targets non - stellar objects with well - measured photometry brighter than @xmath12 , with some additional cuts based on surface brightness @xcite .",
    "the magnitude limit of mgs yields a sample of galaxies peaking at @xmath13 , with very few galaxies above @xmath14 .",
    "selection of sdss targets is performed on dr10 @xcite , based on the specphoto table , which combines primary ( non - duplicate ) photometric objects with primary spectroscopic observations .",
    "nevertheless , in 25 cases more than one primary spectrum was found for the same photometric object , in which case we selected the spectrum that was closest to the photometric position , leaving 730,288 unique objects ( objets with unique objid ) .",
    "these sdss targets constitute shaded areas in figure [ fig : map ] .",
    "our selection for inclusion in gswlc consists of only two criteria :    @xmath15    the first criterion replicates mgs brightness cut , with some rounding to allow for targeting photometry fluctuations .",
    "the second cut removes stars and very nearby galaxies whose photometry is likely to be less accurate because of their large angular size @xcite , and whose redshifts are poorer indications of the distance @xcite .",
    "gswlc therefore includes the entire mgs , complemented by mgs - like galaxies from other programs that fall within the brightness ( and , effectively , the redshift ) cut of mgs : 5.2% from boss ( typically ellipticals ) , and the remaining 2.1% from other surveys ( qso , segue ) . for studies that focus on general population of galaxies ,",
    "it is strongly recommended to use only the mgs galaxies ( flag_mgs = 1 in gswlc ) .",
    "gswlc includes all sdss targets within areas covered by _",
    "galex _ , regardless of a uv detection .",
    "_ galex _  has observed the sky in 1.2 deg .",
    "wide circular fields ( `` tiles '' ) , with a wide range of exposure times @xcite . the greatest uv sky coverage is provided by shallow ( @xmath16 s ) observations , most of which were taken as part of the all - sky imaging survey ( ais ) .",
    "_ galex _  could not safely point in the direction of bright stars , so even the all - sky survey s coverage contains holes .",
    "observations of medium depth , corresponding to one _ galex _  orbit ( @xmath17 s ) , are the basis for medium imaging survey ( mis ) , which specifically targeted areas within sdss footprint . for select fields ,",
    "deeper observations were obtained by co - adding the observations from multiple orbits , to produce the deep imaging survey ( dis ) , with nominal exposure time of 30,000 s.    since the accuracy of uv photometry , and consequently of the derived physical properties , will depend on the depth of the observations , we produce three separate catalogs , each approximately corresponding to shallow ( all - sky ; a ) , medium ( m ) , and deep ( d ) uv imaging surveys .",
    "the catalogs are designated as gswlc - a , gswlc - m , gswlc - d .",
    "each catalog is based only on _ galex _  imaging of certain depth , even if deeper exposures of an object exist :    @xmath18    where the exposure times in nuv band are given in seconds .",
    "fuv exposure times are typically identical to nuv times ( the two bands were observed simultaneously ) , except in cases when the fuv image was missing due to camera malfunction .",
    "note that in gswlc - m we also include individual visits used for dis co - adds , since the exposure times of individual visits fall in the range for gswlc - m .    to define the final samples for inclusion in the catalogs , we take all sdss targets from section [ ssec : scope ] that fall within 0.6 deg of _ galex _  tile centers of the specific uv survey ( a , m or d ) . this gives the following final sample sizes :    @xmath19    where the percentage indicates the fraction of all sdss dr10 targets .",
    "gswlc - m contains 7@xmath20 as many galaxies as the mis sample used in s07 . since _ galex",
    "_  surveys are nested , objects in the deeper catalogs are mostly included in the shallower ones .",
    "the number of unique galaxies encompassed by the three catalogs , 658,911 , is therefore only slightly larger than the number of objects in gswlc - a , and corresponds to 90% of sdss target sample .",
    "_ galex _  data are taken from the final data release ( gr6/7 ) .",
    "matching of sdss to _ galex _  is in general a non - trivial task @xcite because of the changes in galaxy morphology with wavelength , and different resolutions ( @xmath21 for _ galex _  vs.  @xmath22 for sdss ) .",
    "furthermore , the _ galex _  data release contains detections of same objects from multiple tiles .",
    "thus , one needs to address the cases when multiple uv candidates exist for an optical source , and when the uv source may be a blend of two or more optical sources .    in our case , the problem of sdss_galex _  matching is significantly alleviated by the fact that it involves relatively bright objects , having low sky density .",
    "in particular , we find that there are essentially no cases of genuine multiple uv candidates within @xmath21 search radius .",
    "the choice of search radius is based on _ galex _  positions of isolated sdss targets , for which we find negligible bulk offset with respect to sdss ( @xmath23 in either ra or decl . ) , and @xmath24 1d positional uncertainty of @xmath22 .",
    "when multiple uv candidates are nominally present , they are either due to multiple observations ( overlapping tiles ) , or from nuv and fuv detections of the same object that were erroneously left as separate sources in _ galex _  merged - band catalog . when there are multiple observations of the same object , we take the one from the tile with the longest fuv exposure ( if no candidate has an available fuv image , the tile with the longest nuv exposure is selected ) .    while each sdss object has an unambiguous _ galex _  match , the uv measurement may still be affected by blending of several objects independently detected in sdss .",
    "we will address this issue and describe the implemented solution in section [ sec : data ] .",
    "uv detection rates of sdss objects ( @xmath25 threshold , either uv band ) are 54% for gswlc - a , 74% for gswlc - m and 84% for gswlc - d . besides the uv survey depth , the detection rates depend strongly on galaxy s ssfr or color , as can be seen from figure [ fig : glx_det ] , where we plot the detection rates as a function of @xmath26-band magnitude , separately for blue ( @xmath27 ) and red galaxies .",
    "gswlc utilizes _ wise _",
    "observations at 22 @xmath1 ( _ wise _  channel w4 ) to determine sfrs independently from the uv / optical sed fitting .",
    "the depth of _ wise _  observations over the sky is not uniform ( @xmath28 mag vega ) , but is still much more uniform than _ galex _  depth , and essentially covers the entire sky without gaps .",
    "fwhm of w4 psf is @xmath29 .",
    "we use 22 @xmath1 photometry from two independent reductions of _ wise _  data .",
    "the first is the official allwise source catalog , hosted at ipac infrared science archive ( irsa ) at the caltech / jpl , and the second is the `` unwise '' reduction @xcite , where sdss detections served as forced photometry priors .",
    "to match sdss to allwise , we take the closest candidate in a @xmath21 search radius .",
    "note that allwise detections and astrometry are based on simultaneous psf - matched fit to all channels .",
    "thus , the shorter - wavelength channels ( 3.4 ( w1 ) and 4.6 @xmath1 ( w2 ) ) , which have smaller psf widths ( @xmath30 ) and higher s / n , will dominate the astrometric accuracy ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "this makes the adopted search radius sufficient to capture genuine matches , and justifies taking the closer candidate in case of multiple matches ( 3.2% of cases ) .",
    "the detection rate of sdss targets at 22 @xmath1 ( based on @xmath32 threshold of profile magnitudes ) is 32% , which is lower than the detection rate of _",
    "galex_.    since unwise catalog is derived based on sdss dr10 detections , no matching is required ( sources already carry sdss objid ) . forced photometry increases the s / n of measured fluxes",
    ", so the @xmath32 detection rate is 41%,a third higher than of the official catalog .",
    "near - ir photometry ( @xmath33 ) is taken from 2mass extended source catalog ( xsc ) , also hosted at irsa .",
    "we match sdss to 2mass xsc by selecting the closest candidate within @xmath21 search radius .",
    "the detection rate of sdss targets is 48% .",
    "the data used to construct gswlc consist of broad - band photometry ( magnitudes or fluxes and their errors ) from _ galex _ , sdss and _ wise _ , and redshifts from sdss .",
    "comparison datasets will also use line fluxes from sdss spectra .",
    "sdss offers several choices for galaxy photometry : modelmag ( magnitude extracted assuming either de vaucouleurs or exponential profile ) , cmodelmag ( weighted average of de vaucouleurs and exponential magnitudes ) and petromag ( surface - brightness dependent aperture magnitude ) .",
    "the usual practice in sed fitting is to use fluxes that yield most accurate colors .",
    "of sdss magnitudes , the modelmag best fulfills that role .",
    "we confirm that this is the optimal choice by finding that the best - fitting models ( based on optical fitting alone ) have three times lower median @xmath7 when modelmag are used as opposed to cmodelmag or petromag .",
    "also , ssfrs obtained from uv / optical sed fitting that uses modelmag magnitudes have a smaller scatter with respect to ssfrs from _ wise _  and from @xmath3 . while modelmag produces stable colors , the degree to which it will estimate the total light will depend on galaxy size , morphology @xcite and color gradient",
    "@xcite have derived magnitudes that were designed to better capture the total light in each band .",
    "readers can use those catalogs to scale our estimates of the stellar mass and sfr , if that is required for their goals .",
    "based on the comparison of modelmag and @xcite @xmath26-band magnitude , the typical correction should nevertheless be relatively modest ( @xmath34 dex ) .",
    "the _ galex _  source catalog offers only one measure of flux that is recommended for galaxies : mag_auto , a kron elliptical aperture magnitude derived by sextractor @xcite .",
    "we investigate the differences in the methodology of this measurement compared to the one used for sdss photometry , as well as the effects of lower _",
    "galex_resolution , by deriving mag_auto magnitudes of 1000 randomly selected sdss targets whose @xmath35-band images were degraded to match _ galex _  resolution . by comparison with isolated sources ,",
    "we find that the differences between _ galex_-resolution mag_auto and sdss resolution modelmag are dominated by systematic offsets ( up to 0.4 mag ) arising from close companions ( especially at @xmath36 ) which become blended in lower resolution , rather than the differences in the methodology of magnitude measurement ( @xmath37 mag difference ) .    to account for the systematics that arise from both the difference in _",
    "galex _  and",
    "sdss resolutions and the methods of flux measurement , we derive and implement several corrections to uv fluxes .",
    "corrections are derived by comparing the uv magnitudes predicted from optical - only sed fitting of star - forming galaxies ( @xmath27 ) with the actual uv magnitudes .",
    "while any individual predicted uv magnitude is crude ( @xmath38 mag in nuv ) , the corrections are accurate owing to a very large number of galaxies that define them .",
    "first , we confirm that there are no zero - point offsets between the predicted and the actual uv magnitudes .",
    "next , we find that a small edge - of - detector correction is required for nuv , but not fuv , photometry .",
    "nuv magnitudes of sources that appear in the outermost @xmath39 annulus of the field of view , which accounts for 40% of the detector area , are up to 0.1 mag too bright , possibly because of an inaccurate flat fielding .",
    "the amount of correction depends linearly on the radial position within the annulus :    @xmath40    where fov is the distance from the center of the tile in degrees .",
    "next , we derive the centroid shift correction .",
    "the shift between optical and uv positions arises due to random errors , mostly from the lower accuracy of the _ galex _  astrometry , but also from the differences in uv versus optical morphology , which has a slight effect on the measured magnitudes .",
    "again , using the difference between predicted and observed nuv magnitudes , we find the following correction :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the shift between _ galex _  and sdss positions in arcsec .",
    "correction is not applied when @xmath43 , where random errors dominate .",
    "we apply the same correction to nuv and fuv magnitudes .    by far",
    "the most significant correction for uv magnitudes is due to blending .",
    "the degree to which a _",
    "galex _  magnitude will be affected by blending will depend both on the relative brightness of the nearest companion ( any sdss photometric object ) and its separation ( @xmath44 ) from the target .",
    "we construct corrections ( same for nuv and fuv ) as a function of the difference in @xmath35 magnitude ( @xmath45 ) for four ranges of separation :    @xmath46    we note that even though the corrections to uv magnitudes may be significant for individual objects ( in particular those with a close blended companion ) , the sfrs for the majority of star - forming galaxies are not significantly affected by their application .",
    "we use fuv fluxes measured at nuv positions ( fuv_ncat ) rather than from independent fuv detections , as they provide more robust uv color .",
    "both nuv and fuv measurements require a @xmath25 threshold in flux_auto .",
    "sdss and _ galex _  photometry must be corrected for galactic reddening .",
    "we find that the combination of extinction coefficients from @xcite for uv bands and @xcite for optical bands produces somewhat better fits ( @xmath47 smaller @xmath7 ) than the corrections based on @xcite , or on @xcite alone .",
    "we reproduce the adopted corrections here .",
    "@xmath48    photometry catalogs usually list only random flux errors , without systematic , or calibration errors .",
    "we find that the default cigale padding of formal photometry errors by the addition ( in quadrature ) of 0.1 mag to catalog magnitude errors to account for systematic errors in models and photometry leads to a significant loss of derived physical parameter accuracy , as evidenced by 50% larger scatter when derived sfrs are compared with independent sfr estimates . instead , following s07 , we add more modest calibration errors ( determined from repeat observations ) of ( 0.052 , 0.026 , 0.02 , 0.01 , 0.01 , 0.01 , 0.01 ) mag in ( fuv , nuv , @xmath49 , @xmath35 , @xmath26 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) , plus the @xmath49-band red leak error of @xmath52 , derived in s07 based on the description of red leak in @xcite .",
    "the validity of the adopted calibration errors is verified by constructing the distribution of magnitude residuals ( fitted minus real magnitude divided by the total error ) , which follow unit gaussians .",
    "we derive what we refer to as `` mid - ir sfrs '' using two types of 22 @xmath1 magnitude ( flux ) measurements .",
    "the first is what allwise source catalog calls a _ profile - fitting _ magnitude ( w4mpro ) .",
    "the profile is simply the psf , so these magnitudes are essentially psf magnitudes , and are thus most appropriate for unresolved sources . since the psf fwhm at 22 @xmath1 is @xmath29 , which is larger than 91% of galaxies ( @xmath53 size ) , these magnitudes are reasonably appropriate for sdss galaxies . yet",
    ", psf magnitudes will systematically underestimate the flux in larger galaxies .",
    "this is largely remedied in forced photometry from unwise catalog , which applies sdss - measured galaxy profiles ( convoluted with w4 psf ) as photometry priors .",
    "to derive emission - line sfrs ( which we call `` @xmath3  sfrs '' ) , we use @xmath3  and @xmath54  fluxes from the mpa / jhu catalog , based on dr7 .",
    "measurement of emission line fluxes is described in @xcite .",
    "we also use the emission - line ( bpt diagram , @xcite ) classification of galaxies from the mpa / jhu catalog , derived as described in @xcite ( hereafter b04 ) .",
    "although cigale allows the ir dust emission to be fit in conjunction with the stellar emission , we derive the mid - ir sfrs separately , to avoid potential systematics .",
    "for example , cigale normalizes the ir sed template , so that the total dust emission ( i.e. , total ir luminosity , @xmath55 ) equals the stellar emission absorbed by the dust in the uv / optical / near - ir .",
    "however , the shape of the ir sed is a free parameter @xcite , which means that without the far - ir sed , as in the case of _ wise _  data , the ir luminosity will not be strongly constrained , and could thus be driven , through energy balance requirement , by any potential systematics in the estimate of the absorbed stellar luminosity , such as those that would arise from incorrect assumptions about the attenuation law .    instead , accurate ir luminosities can be obtained from 22 @xmath1 observations using _ luminosity - dependent _ ir templates , and these estimates can then be compared to the results of the sed fitting of the stellar emission ( for actively star - forming galaxies , where dust heating by young stars dominates ) , to verify whether energy balance is satisfied .",
    "another advantage of performing the stellar sed fitting separately is that in a joint fit to stellar and dust emission one also has to worry about the contamination of ir emission from dust - obscured type 2 agn ( such as seyfert 2 , or high - excitation radio galaxies , @xcite ) .",
    "while the agn contribution can be modeled in cigale , it introduces additional degrees of freedom , further weakening the usefulness of an energy balance requirement , in particular when only mid - ir photometry is available .",
    "the mid - ir sfrs that we report in gswlc are computed as follows .",
    "first we calculate the total ir luminosity ( 8 - 1000 @xmath1 ) by interpolating the luminosity - dependent ir templates of @xcite so that they match the 22 @xmath1 flux .",
    "we also tested using @xcite templates , which do not have an associated luminosity , but the ir sed shape - luminosity dependence is imposed from empirically - calibrated relations of @xcite .",
    "the two methods produce very similar ir luminosities ( average difference 0.01 dex , scatter 0.02 dex ) , but @xcite - based luminosities are marginally ( @xmath56 ) better correlated with ir luminosities from _ herschel _ , so we adopt them for gswlc .",
    "we check the robustness of our 22 @xmath1-derived ir luminosities by comparing them to ir luminosities derived for sdss stripe82 galaxies by @xcite .",
    "their ir luminosity is obtained by fitting ir templates to _ wise _  22 @xmath57 flux _ and _ the sub - mm fluxes from _ herschel _ spire ( 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath1 ) .",
    "because they have multiple flux points , they derive ir luminosities from @xcite ir templates that do not have an associated luminosity .",
    "the cross - matched sample consists of 817 galaxies .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : herschel ] , the agreement of ir luminosities is excellent , with no ( @xmath58 dex ) systematic offset over the range probed by _",
    "herschel _ ( @xmath59 ) , perfect linearity , and a scatter of only 0.07 dex .",
    "comparison of the specific luminosities ( @xmath60 ) , which removes the distance dependence ( section [ sec : comp ] ) , reveals a mild non - linearity ( with a slope of 1.10 ) , in the sense that _ wise _  ir luminosities of galaxies with the lowest specific luminosity ( or ssfr ) are 0.1 dex lower compared to galaxies with the highest specific luminosity . while the agreement between our and rosario et al .",
    "ir luminosities is encouraging , there is a caveat that the latter are not fully independent form our estimates , because both use 22 @xmath1 flux . the role of 22 @xmath1 flux point in rosario et al .",
    "estimate is likely significant given that their data do not sample the peak of the ir sed ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the above comparison was carried out for 22 @xmath1 ir luminosities derived using profile ( psf ) fluxes from the official allwise catalog .",
    "if we instead used 22 @xmath1 photometry from unwise @xcite , the small scatter with respect to @xcite _ herschel+wise _ ir luminosities of @xmath62 dex ( figure [ fig : herschel ] ) would grow to @xmath63 .",
    "this does not necessarily imply that unwise fluxes are noisier , because the _ herschel+wise _ uses the psf flux from allwise catalog .    to obtain mid - ir sfrs from ir luminosity",
    ", we use a simple conversion given by @xcite , adjusted to chabrier imf using the 1.58 conversion factor ( s07 ) :    @xmath64    where sfr is in @xmath65 and @xmath55 in @xmath66 .    to derive @xmath3  sfrs , which we use for comparison purposes , we take @xmath3  fluxes and correct them using the balmer decrement method , assuming case b recombination and the @xcite extinction curve .",
    "emission line fluxes are measured within @xmath67 sdss fibers , which we find to capture , on average , 30% of the galaxy mass , depending on galaxy s distance , size and profile .",
    "dust - corrected @xmath3fluxes are then converted to sfr using the @xcite relation , adjusted by @xmath680.24 dex @xcite to convert from salpeter to chabrier imf .",
    "comparison of fiber @xmath3  sfr with other , total sfr indicators , can be accomplished if all measurements are converted to ssfrs .",

    "physical parameters from uv / optical seds are derived using cigale ( @xcite , m.  boquien et al . in prep . ) , a powerful code that produces libraries ( grids ) of model seds and performs the sed fitting .",
    "the code was originally written in fortran and recently re - written in python .",
    "it is continually being improved and expanded in capabilities .",
    "we use the most recent python version 0.9 , which offers full control over parameters that specify sf history , dust attenuation , and emission line fluxes .",
    "this flexibility has proved essential in order to derive robust results .",
    "model seds produced by cigale , and from which model photometry is extracted , consist of uv / optical / near - ir stellar emission ( @xmath69 ) , and , optionally , the ir dust emission ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "third , also optional component is the nebular emission ( lines and continuum ) . for reasons discussed in section [ sec : wise ]",
    ", we will restrict the sed fitting to stellar emission , with the contribution of emission lines included .",
    "cigale synthesizes stellar emission based on either @xcite ( bc03 ) or @xcite ( m05 ) sps .",
    "the most important difference between them is in the treatment of the tp - agb phase of stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "cigale can not currently include the contribution of emission lines in conjunction with m05 models , which , as we will demonstrate , are important for obtaining robust measurements .",
    "therefore we opt to use bc03 models .",
    "the use of bc03 models may anyhow be a more appropriate choice , given some evidence that bc03 models better reproduce optical and near - ir colors than m05 models @xcite .",
    "cigale can also perform bayesian sed fitting and report the physical parameters and their errors .",
    "bayesian sed fitting consist of building probability distribution functions of physical parameters by assigning probabilities to each model spectrum ( at a matching redshift ) based on the goodness of fit between the model and observed broad - band seds .",
    "the methodology has been described in detail in s07 , @xcite and other papers . @xcite and @xcite",
    "provide comprehensive reviews of various aspects of sed fitting .",
    "while sed fitting represents an optimal way to extract information from photometry ( and/or spectra ) , it will be limited by the uncertainties in stellar and dust attenuation models @xcite , and the choice of priors ( e.g. , appropriate sf histories and dust attenuation laws ) .    in order to specify the modeling assumptions ( e.g. , which dust model or parameterization of sf history to use ) the usual practice is to select the parameters that yield the smallest relative differences between the observed and the best - fitting model photometry , i.e. , that minimize some average @xmath7 of the sample",
    ". however , in some cases different modeling assumptions may lead to marginal changes in @xmath7 ( suggesting that uv / optical sed is degenerate with respect to them ) .",
    "we will therefore require both the internal consistency ( small @xmath7 ) and the external one : maximum correlation of the sed fitting sfr with respect to two entirely independently derived sfr tracers ( mid - ir and @xmath3 ) .    in our analysis we assume a chabrier imf @xcite .",
    "cigale assumes a flat wmap7 cosmology ( @xmath71 km s@xmath72 mpc@xmath72 , @xmath73 ) .",
    "we perform sed fitting on uv and optical photometry , ( 0.15 - 0.9 @xmath1 ) , omitting the longer - wavelength stellar emission ( 1.1 - 5.4 @xmath1 ) .",
    "the near - ir photometry is excluded because it increases the reduced @xmath7 values and worsens ( albeit slightly ) the correlations with mid - ir and @xmath3-derived sfrs .",
    "parameters from the sed fitting are reliable to the extent that the models are able to reproduce the observed colors .",
    "we find that the model photometry , either based on bc03 or m05 , does not accurately reproduce the near - ir colors from 2mass photometry .",
    "in particular , both models imply a strong correlation between @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which is not seen in the data ( s.  salim , in prep . )",
    "stellar mass estimates based on near - ir photometry are often perceived as more accurate and/or more precise than those based on optical bands , or that , at the minimum , the near - ir photometry improves the precision of stellar mass estimates .",
    "the reasoning underlying this claim is that stellar emission peaks in the near - ir and that near - ir mass - to - light ratio is less sensitive to the stellar population age , and the effects of dust .",
    "while these arguments are correct , they do not take into account large modeling discrepancies in the near - ir mass - to - light ratios @xcite , arising due to the uncertainties in our understanding of the post - main sequence phases of stellar evolution , the phases which dominate the energy output in the near - ir @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite find that the inclusion of near - ir photometry in sed fits leads to discrepancies with respect to dynamical masses , and that these discrepancies depend on the sps model used .    even if there existed no major uncertainties in the models and no discrepancies between the models and the data (",
    "thus , no concerns that the near - ir will affect the _ accuracy _ of mass estimates ) , the improvement in the _ precision _ of stellar masses achieved by adding the near - ir photometry to the optical photometry is much more modest than usually assumed .",
    "@xcite have studied physical parameters derived from mock observations of gama galaxies when just the optical photometry , or optical plus ukidss - depth near - ir photometry was used to perform the sed fitting .",
    "they show that the improvement in the precision of stellar masses when the near - ir photometry is added to sed fitting is small ( 0.05 vs.  0.06 dex , their fig .",
    "the parameter whose precision improves the most is the stellar metallicity .",
    "indeed , the sensitivity of near - ir luminosities , and even red optical bands ( @xmath50 or @xmath51 ) , to metallicity ( e.g. , fig .  9 of @xcite ; fig .  10 of @xcite )",
    "is another reason why near - ir alone is a more problematic tracer of stellar mass than the multi - band optical light .      in the following three sections we discuss the choice of modeling parameters , starting with sf histories and metallicities .",
    "bc03 models are available for six stellar metallicities , of which we use the higher four , from 0.2 @xmath76 to 2.5 @xmath76 , which is an adequate range for most galaxies in sdss @xcite .",
    "we have considered two different parametrizations of sf history offered by cigale : two - component exponential and delayed exponential . in the two - component exponential model , the sf history is a composite of two exponentially declining functions ( @xmath77 models ) , each with its own starting epoch ( age ) and e - folding time .",
    "the normalization of the younger population is specified by the mass fraction @xmath78 , which can also be set to zero , resulting in a single exponential model .",
    "each component starts at maximum value and then decreases monotonically .",
    "in contrast , the delayed exponential sf history is smooth ( e.g. , @xcite ) : it starts from zero sfr , reaches a peak at some time and then declines .",
    "it is given by :    @xmath79    we find that as long as the parameters are chosen so that the model colors ( and more specifically , model ssfrs ) cover the range of colors or ssfrs present in observations ( for delayed sfhs this requires allowing @xmath80 in eq .",
    "[ eq : delayed ] ) , either sf history will produce similar stellar masses and sfrs . specifically , there is no systematic difference for masses of non - main sequence , low - ssfr galaxies ( log ssfr@xmath2 ) , while the difference in masses for actively star - forming galaxies is typically 0.1 dex .",
    "the difference in sfrs is similar in degree ( see also @xcite ) , and of the same sign , which means that the difference in ssfrs is less than either the difference in mass or sfr . while both parametrizations perform reasonably well , the two - component exponential sf histories yield better fits ( geometric mean of reduced @xmath7 0.7 vs.  1.0 ) , presumably because , by not being smooth , they are able to better match the bursty sf history of low - mass galaxies @xcite .",
    "we thus adopt the two - component exponential parametrization .",
    "delayed exponential models have been preferred over exponential models in some recent studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , there are important differences among the exponential models .",
    "if a single exponential model is assumed to have started in the early universe ( e.g. , @xmath81 yr ) , in order to acknowledge the fact that galaxies contain ancient stellar populations no matter how dominant the current episode of sf may be @xcite , then such model will fail to reproduce the ssfrs of many star - forming galaxies today , simply because log ssfr@xmath82 .",
    "it is this naive implementation of the exponential model ( e.g. , @xcite ) that results in inferior performance .",
    "the problem of single exponential model not producing high ssfrs can be alleviated by allowing the starting epoch of the model to be more recent than the big bang .",
    "though later epoch galaxy _ formation _ is obviously not realistic , it can instead be interpreted as the epoch of peak of sf activity .",
    "variable starting time was assumed in essentially all work that base their sf histories on a single exponential , including s07 , which in addition had stochastic bursts superimposed on exponential models .    allowing recent starting times for the exponential model results in sfrs that are comparable to more sophisticated models . between sfrs",
    "derived using their classical models ( which assume exponential histories with a range of formation times ) and their more sophisticated models ( sf history based on cosmological simulations ) .",
    "however , the two models also assume different attenuation laws ( fixed slope vs.  multiple slopes ) , which will affect the sfrs through the derived dust attenuation ( see their figure 6 . ) , so it is not clear that the difference in sf histories is responsible for most of the offset .",
    "] however , this approach will neglect ( `` outshine '' ) any old population , resulting in somewhat underestimated masses @xcite .",
    "this problem is resolved with a two - component exponential model used here , where one component corresponds to high - redshift sf . while more realistic sf histories may have multiple bursts , or are in general quite variable @xcite ,",
    "modeling these features with high temporal precision is unimportant from the standpoint of broad - band sed fitting , where even the characteristics of the most recent burst can not be constrained with any precision because of the burst age vs.burst amplitude degeneracy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the parameters of the adopted two - component exponential model are as follows .",
    "the formation time of the old population is 10 gyr before observation epoch , with e - folding times that span a range from 850 myr ( fast decline that defines the lower ssfr limit of log ssfr @xmath83 ) to nearly constant 20 gyr ( which has declined only 0.2 dex since formation ) .",
    "formation times for the younger component span from 100 myr ( the shortest timescale to which uv observations are sensitive ) to 5 gyr .",
    "their e - folding time is 20 gyr , i.e. , nearly constant . in order to produce the highest",
    "ssfrs observed today ( log ssfr @xmath84 ) , the mass fraction of the younger component must span up to @xmath85 .",
    "thus our library of sf histories looks like old exponentials with various decay times , with a relatively flat burst superimposed .",
    "cigale allows the dust attenuation law to be specified as a simple power law ( @xmath86 , following @xcite ) , or according to the @xcite recipe ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the calzetti curve can be modified so that the overall slope becomes more or less steep , by multiplying it with the power law of slope @xmath88 @xcite :    @xmath89    note that slope modification changes @xmath90 from 4.05 , the value it has for the calzetti curve .",
    "the attenuation law can be further modified to include a uv bump of varying strength @xcite .",
    "we systematically tested various modifications of the calzetti attenuation law .",
    "we produce model grids where the range of color indices lies between @xmath91 and 0.6 mag for the young ( @xmath92 myr ) population ( i.e. , the dust affecting the nebular lines ; equivalent to @xmath931.5 mag ) .",
    "attenuation that affects older stars , and therefore most of the stellar continuum , is taken to be smaller by a factor of 0.44 , following @xcite .",
    "the tests were carried out with galaxies classified in the bpt diagram as star - forming , for which mid - ir luminosity and dust - corrected @xmath3  luminosity provide reliable estimates of sfr .",
    "the results are illustrated in figure [ fig : ssfr_comp ] .",
    "the upper panels show the comparison between ssfr obtained from the sed fitting , assuming the standard calzetti curve , which has no uv bump , against independently derived mid - ir and @xmath3ssfrs .",
    "note that the comparison is carried out in terms of ssfr , which better reveals systematic trends than the usual sfr comparison ( section [ sec : comp ] ) .",
    "similar trends are seen vs.  mid - ir and @xmath3 .",
    "the differences increase with the increasing ssfr until log ssfr@xmath94 , in the sense that the values derived from sed fitting assuming the calzetti curve tend to be up to 0.4 dex higher . at still higher ssfrs",
    "however , there is reasonable agreement between the ssfrs , as expected , since the calzetti curve was derived from starburst galaxies with high ssfrs .",
    "the middle row shows the comparisons when the calzetti law is modified to include a uv bump of varying intensity ( from no bump to @xmath95 the mw value ) .",
    "the uv / optical sed fits become formally better ( geometric mean of reduced @xmath7s goes from 1.3 to 0.8 ) , and the correlation with mid - ir and @xmath3  ssfrs improves ( from @xmath96 to 0.32 dex , for mid - ir comparison ) . however , the non - linearity ( the slope of the correlation featuring logarithms of ssfrs not being unity ) persists , as well as a tail of galaxies with unusually low ssfrs .",
    "the bottom row shows the comparisons when the calzetti attenuation law is further modified to make it steeper ( with @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) , in addition to allowing the uv bump .",
    "there is now a significant reduction in scatter with respect to mid - ir and @xmath3  ssfrs ( @xmath99 ) , and the relation is fairly linear .",
    "this is our adopted dust attenuation model .",
    "we note that achieving this level of agreement between sed fitting ssfrs and mid - ir ssfrs requires both the steepening of the attenuation curve and the addition of the uv bump .",
    "just steepening the slope of the attenuation curve does remove most of the non - linearity with respect to mid - ir ssfr ( plot not shown ) , but still yields relatively high reduced @xmath7 of 1.0 , regardless of the amount of steepening . in other words ,",
    "the combination of the two modifications is necessary to achieve both the small @xmath7 values and good agreement with other indicators .",
    "the agreement between sed and mid - ir sfrs demonstrates that the energy balance is fulfilled when this modified attenuation law is used : the energy absorbed by the dust in the stellar sed matches the energy emitted in the ir .",
    "we note that assuming an attenuation curve in a power - law form , having slopes @xmath100 ( preferred by the majority of galaxies ) and @xmath101 , and adding the uv bump to them , has a similar effect to modifying the standard calzetti curve as described in the preceding paragraph . for comparison",
    ", the standard calzetti curve can be approximated in the uv range by a power - law of slope @xmath102 .",
    "it must be stressed that the differences in ssfr obtained with various attenuation laws are largely driven by the changes in sfr , rather than @xmath103 .",
    "the stellar masses of star - forming galaxies obtained with the calzetti dust attenuation law are on average only 0.06 dex lower than the stellar masses obtained with the modified law .",
    "however , the masses of a small number of individual galaxies , especially those with very high ssfr , can differ up to 0.4 dex in either direction , i.e. , the dispersion of the two mass estimates increases with ssfr . for completeness",
    ", we report that for passive galaxies the use of the calzetti dust law yields stellar masses that are 0.06 dex higher than the ones obtained with our modified attenuation law , and this difference is rather constant from one passive galaxy to another , i.e. , it has a small dispersion of only 0.02 dex .",
    "we conclude that while star - forming galaxies may be governed by a range of attenuation laws , they generally exhibit a steeper law than the standard calzetti curve ( @xmath104 , on average ) , and include a uv bump ( 1.1 times the mw value , on average ) .",
    "this average curve has @xmath105 , compared with @xmath106 for the calzetti curve , and agrees well with the curve derived empirically by @xcite : a mw - like curve with @xmath107 instead of @xmath108 ( reducing @xmath90 makes the curve steeper ) .",
    "evidence for a steeper - than - calzetti curve has been found in other studies as well @xcite , though not as steep as the one found here and in conroy et al .",
    "more detailed investigation of these results and their implications will be presented in a separate paper .",
    "finally , we describe how we account for the flux from emission lines , which can have a significant effect on broadband fluxes and colors of galaxies with high equivalent widths @xcite .",
    "cigale calculates the contribution of 124 lines , specified by metallicity ( taken to equal the stellar metallicity of sps models ) and ionization parameter .",
    "we select the lowest ionization parameter available , @xmath109 , as it produces the biggest improvements and is closest to direct measurements @xcite .    the formal quality of uv / optical fits is significantly improved by correcting for emission - line flux ( geometric mean of @xmath110 drops from 1.2 to 0.7 ) .",
    "more importantly , accounting for emission lines significantly improves the correlation of sed ssfrs with other indicators",
    ". for galaxies with high ssfrs , not correcting for emission lines produces offsets of up to 0.5 dex , as can be seen by comparing figure [ fig : ssfr_nolines ] , which does not correct for emission lines , with the lower row of figure [ fig : ssfr_comp ] .",
    "emission line correction makes very little difference for stellar masses , which change by @xmath58 dex on average .    while the addition of emission line to model fluxes results in overall improvement , the correction is not perfect .",
    "nebular metallicity is fixed to stellar metallicity , which is not realistic . also , the ionization parameter of many galaxies is lower than the minimum ionization parameter available in cigale .",
    "we see some redshift - dependent trends in sfr , as lines straddle across the bandpasses .",
    "we account for this systematic offset ( @xmath1110.1 dex on average ) by deriving an average correction , in 0.01 wide bins of redshift , with respect to sfrs from b04 ( using galaxies classified as star - forming ; section [ ssec : comp_b04 ] ) , and applying it to all sfrs from the sed fitting .",
    "we use b04 sfrs for this correction instead of mid - ir sfrs , because the latter are available for only 63% of star - forming galaxies .",

    "optical light in @xmath26 band is dominated by the emission from older stellar populations , so it may not represent an optimal prior for 22 @xmath1 observations , where the bulge emission is suppressed , while the star - forming regions in the disk dominate .",
    "another possibility is related to the fact that unwise is based on cmodelmag profiles , whereas all other sfrs are based on modelmag sdss photometry . despite being somewhat noisier in comparisons with other ( s)sfrs overall , unwise ir luminosities and sfrs are less biased for large ( @xmath147 ) galaxies ( where the allwise psf magnitudes can underestimate the sfr by up to 0.1 dex ) , so we retain them in gswlc alongside sfrs from allwise catalog .",
    "our recommendation is to use unwise sfrs in studies that explore dependence on galaxy size or profile ( e.g. , sersic index ) and also in studies that focus on galaxies with large angular diameter .",
    "otherwise , allwise sfrs are recommended , and we continue to focus on them in subsequent discussion .",
    "the middle panel shows the comparison for agn - hosting galaxies .",
    "this category includes all galaxies above the @xcite line , i.e. , what b04 call sf / agn composites , agn ( seyferts ) and liners ( iclass = 3 , 4 , 5 ) .",
    "allwise detects 45% of such galaxies .",
    "first , we notice that no correlation is present in the lower part of the plot , approximately when log ssfr@xmath132 .",
    "these are nearly quiescent galaxies of liner type ( thus , potentially passive galaxies with non - agn emission lines @xcite ) . for such galaxies the ir emission , if detected , will be dominated by dust heating by relatively dusty old or intermediate - age ( e.g.  agb ) stellar populations@xcite , and will therefore not be indicative of the current sf @xcite . when the ir luminosity of such galaxies is converted into sfrs using simple , fixed - coefficient formulae ( eq .",
    "[ eq : lir ] ) , which assume dust is heated by young stars , the sfr will be overestimated @xcite . for agn galaxies with higher",
    "ssfrs , the mid - ir ssfrs tend to be up to 0.6 dex higher than the sed ssfrs , suggesting a non - negligible dust heating by agn , that produces excess emission in the mid - ir . the excess appears to be greater for increasing ssfrs , which would be expected if the gas both fuels the sf and drives the agn accretion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "classification of a galaxy as a star - former or agn , as performed by b04 , requires minimum adjusted snr of 3 in @xmath3  and other lines ( @xmath148 in raw @xmath3  snr ) .",
    "galaxies that are too weak to allow classification , what we call `` no @xmath3 '' category ( iclass = 1 ) , are shown in the right panel .",
    "these galaxies are mostly quiescent , so it is not surprising that the allwise detection rate is only 5% . when detected , the majority of galaxies in this class have low sed ssfrs , as expected .",
    "however , mid - ir ssfrs can be too high by up to 2 dex , because the ir emission from old stars is interpreted as current sf .",
    "we conclude that mid - ir sfrs are not reliable for quiescent or nearly quiescent galaxies when obtained through simple recipes that have a fixed conversion factor between ir luminosity and sfr ( eq . [ eq : lir ] ) , and therefore in gswlc we remove mid - ir sfrs for galaxies for which log ssfr@xmath132 ( dashed line in middle and right panels of figure [ fig : comp_wise ] ) .    interestingly , there are some galaxies in the `` no @xmath3 '' class for which the sed fitting ssfrs are quite high , overlapping with the values of normal star - forming galaxies ( log ssfr@xmath149 ) .",
    "it may seem contradictory that a galaxy with essentially no @xmath3  emission could have such high ssfr .",
    "there are two possible reasons for this : ( 1 ) difference in sf timescales .",
    "@xmath3  is not present because a galaxy is in a post - starburst phase  uv and mid - ir emission will persist after the o - stars that give rise to @xmath3  emission have died off . in other words ,",
    "high sed and mid - ir ssfrs reflect recent , but not instantaneous values .",
    "the post - starburst galaxies would form the tail of high ssfrs in figure [ fig : comp_wise ] ( right ; log ssfr@xmath150 ) .",
    "their sed and mid - ir ssfrs agree , with no mid - ir excess like the one seen for agns .",
    "this suggests that post - starburst galaxies , which are usually considered to be the results of mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) , nonetheless do not have a significant agn emission .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath3  is not present within the sdss fiber , but the sf ( and presumably the @xmath3emission ) is present outside of it . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have studied such population in detail with high - resolution uv , optical and @xmath3  imaging , and have confirmed that these are typically lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies with no sf in the bulge , but with low - level sf present in a ring outside of sdss fiber .",
    "the ssfrs of such star - forming s0s would be in the range @xmath151 log ssfr @xmath152 , i.e. , lower than post - starburst galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : comp_ha ] shows equivalent comparison of sed ssfrs with respect to @xmath3  ssfrs .",
    "@xmath3  ssfrs are measured within the @xmath67 sdss fiber , which covers between 17% and 50% of the galaxy s stellar mass .",
    "the comparison of star - forming galaxies ( left panel ) shows similar scatter as that seen with respect to the mid - ir .",
    "the relation is somewhat ssfr dependent .",
    "one expects the relation between total and fiber ssfr to be linear ( slope in log - log plot equal to 1 ) only if there are no ssfr gradients .",
    "somewhat increased nonlinearity for galaxies with log ssfr@xmath153 suggests either that the sf tends to be centrally concentrated so that it produces higher ssfrs within the fiber compared to the integrated ssfr , or , that the fiber mass from the mpa / jhu catalog , which we use to normalize the @xmath3  sfr , is systematically underestimated for bursty galaxies ( section [ ssec : comp_mass ] ) .    for galaxies with agn / liner contribution ( middle panel ) ,",
    "there are no systematic differences for hosts having high sf ( log ssfr@xmath150 ) .",
    "this is in contrast to mid - ir ssfrs that showed an excess in this regime . @xmath3",
    "ssfrs start to display systematic discrepancies at lower ssfrs , in the sense that @xmath3  ssfrs are up to 0.7 dex too low .",
    "we find that many of such cases are galaxies with no optical signs of sf , either photometrically ( optical colors are red ) or spectroscopically ( not much @xmath3 ) , and yet the uv is clearly indicative of sf  often the uv colors are noticeably blue and uniformly spread across the disk .",
    "these galaxies may be in a declining phase of sf where the uv emission is higher than the rapidly diminishing @xmath3 .    for galaxies with \" no @xmath3 ",

    "there is an overdensity of galaxies below log ssfr@xmath154 , where sed sfrs estimates also become rather uncertain ( figure [ fig : error ] ) and are more likely just the upper limits of galaxies with no current sf whatsoever , such as the majority of early - type galaxies .    to conclude , for actively star - forming galaxies all three indicators ( sed fitting , mid - ir , and @xmath3 ) provide robust measurements of ( s)sfr . for mid - ir ,",
    "the depth of _ wise _  allows only 2/3 of sdss galaxies to be detected .",

    "this corresponds to green - valley and quiescent galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the mid - ir sfr appears to be affected by agn emission , limiting its usefulness .",
    "sed ssfrs are measurements of choice in low - ssfr regime , but even they become essentially upper limits when log ssfr@xmath155 ( for gswlc - m ; -12.0 for gswlc - d ; -11.5 for gswlc - a ) .",
    "in this section we compare gswlc stellar masses and sed fitting sfrs ( primarily through ssfrs ) with those from previously published catalogs",
    ". the focus will be on ( s)sfr comparisons , which are more sensitive than stellar mass measurements .",
    "we continue to present the comparisons using gswlc - m , but the results hold with gswlc - a and gswlc - d .",
    "the mpa / jhu catalog is the most widely used source of stellar masses for sdss galaxies .",
    "prior to dr7 , the most recent version of this catalog , the mpa / jhu catalog listed stellar masses derived in @xcite , using a method that combines photometric information to assess dust attenuation , and spectroscopic indices to constrain the sf history and mass - to - light ratio .",
    "spectroscopic indices were measured within the fiber , so the method assumed no @xmath156 gradients . in the dr7 version of mpa / jhu catalog , the method from kauffmann et al .",
    "was replaced with the bayesian sed fitting method , using only the optical broad - band photometry from sdss ( modelmag ) and models described in s07 . here",
    "we will only present comparisons with respect to dr7 version of the mpa / jhu catalog .    as described in section [ sec : sed ] , gswlc uses different specification of sf histories and dust extinction from those used in s07 and the mpa / jhu catalog .",
    "furthermore , unlike the mpa / jhu catalog ( but , like s07 ) , gswlc uses the constraints offered by uv photometry .",
    "figure [ fig : comp_mass ] shows the difference between gswlc and mpa / jhu stellar masses as a function of ssfr .",
    "again , we prefer the presentation of the results in this , relative , distance - independent way than the usual mass vs.  mass comparison . on average ,",
    "gswlc stellar masses are somewhat higher than the mpa / jhu ones , with typical difference being 0.03 dex for passive galaxies , and @xmath1110.13 dex for the active ones .",
    "the scatter of the difference in mass , 0.07 dex , is consistent with the formal estimates of the mass error ( figure [ fig : error ] ) .",
    "the inclusion of the uv photometry is responsible for 0.04 dex increase for active galaxies .",
    "the remaining 0.09 dex increase for active galaxies ( and 0.03 dex increase for passive ones ) is mostly due to our use of two - component exponential sf histories .",
    "we confirm that the difference would not have been present if we had used the _ delayed _ exponential histories instead ( eq.[eq : delayed ] ) .",
    "the critical difference between the delayed exponential and our implementation of the two - component exponential sf history is that in the latter the old component starts in the early universe , whereas the delayed exponential , having a single peak , will be shifted towards later epochs .",
    "recently , @xcite have reported that the masses of nearby high - ssfr galaxies obtained by summing up the masses in individual `` pixels '' are up to 0.1 dex higher than the masses from integrated light .",
    "they proposed that the difference arose from `` outshining '' of the old , fainter populations in galaxies with younger populations ( high ssfr ) .",
    "it appears that our use of the two - component exponential sf history , in which the old component is set to have started in the early universe , may have recovered this deficit .",
    "more recently , stellar masses for sdss galaxies were published by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the differences of gswlc masses with respect to these masses follow the trends we have shown with respect to masses from the mpa / jhu catalog : little difference for passive galaxies , and up to 0.2 dex difference for galaxies with high ssfr .",
    "comparison of our masses obtained with and without the uv photometry reveals that in the case when there is another photometric source within 23@xmath157 , the masses obtained from joint uv and optical photometry will be biased upward by 0.05 dex , presumably because of the unaccounted blending in the uv .",
    "this affects only a few percent of all sources .",
    "the mpa / jhu catalog also provides sfrs , and until recently it was the only publicly available source of sfrs for sdss galaxies .",
    "sfrs derived in mpa / jhu follow the method of b04 , with modifications introduced in the most recent ( dr7 ) version of the catalog .",
    "we first describe both the original method and its modifications , but the comparison will be presented only for the dr7 version of mpa / jhu catalog .",
    "mpa / jhu catalog ( and the original b04 ) sfrs are often described as @xmath3 , or emission - line sfrs .",
    "this is accurate only for the portion of a galaxy contained within the fiber , and only for galaxies classified as star - forming using the bpt diagram , for which the agn contribution to emission lines should be negligible . for galaxies with agn contribution or having weak lines ( altogether 78% of sdss galaxies ) , b04 derive sfr in the fiber based on a relation between the emission - line ssfr and d4000 index , constructed from star - forming galaxies .",
    "next , the sfr estimate within the fiber is aperture - corrected to produce the total ( integrated ) sfr .",
    "b04 performs this correction by first establishing the relationship between fiber ssfr and the fiber broad - band colors of star - forming galaxies , and then applying these relations in a bayesian fashion to the light outside of the fibers to arrive at the out - of - fiber sfr .",
    "the total sfr is then obtained as the sum of fiber and out - of - fiber sfrs .",
    "the dr7 mpa / jhu catalog modifies the procedure for deriving out - of - fiber sfrs , by instead performing the sed fitting to @xmath158 photometry , using the models and methods described in s07 .",
    "altogether , the sfr method of mpa / jhu catalog ( and original b04 ) is an emisison - line / d4000/sed fitting hybrid .",
    "the temporal sensitivity of such sfrs will be between the @xmath159 myr timescales traced by the emission lines and @xmath160 gyr timescale for @xmath49-band light .",
    "s07 presented detailed comparison of their sed sfrs and the original sfrs from b04 .",
    "gswlc contains many improvements over the s07 methodology , as does the mpa / jhu catalog with respect to b04 .",
    "the comparison of gswlc - m and dr7 mpa / jhu total ssfrs is given in figure [ fig : comp_b04 ] .",
    "it uses the same division of galaxies into sf , agn and `` no @xmath3 '' categories as employed earlier . in order to decouple sfr and mass systematics ,",
    "both ssfrs are obtained by normalizing by the same mass ( from gswlc ) .",
    "note that for 3% of galaxies in mpa / jhu catalog the total sfrs are present even when masses are not .",
    "we find that in those cases the reported total sfr is incorrect , and assumes the value of _ fiber _ sfr .",
    "we exclude those values from the comparison .",
    "ssfrs for star - forming galaxies ( left panel ) agree very well , with a scatter of @xmath161 , which is smaller than the scatter of sed ssfrs with respect to mid - ir or @xmath3  ssfrs ( figure [ fig : comp_wise ] and [ fig : comp_ha ] ) .",
    "the comparison for agn hosts reveals some systematic discrepancies , especially for intermediate ssfrs , which can in some cases reach @xmath1111 dex .",
    "we have already seen similar , but smaller offsets in comparison with @xmath3  _ fiber _ ssfrs , which we attributed to optically ( spectroscopically _ and _ photometrically ) inconspicuous sf . if we intentionally leave out the uv bands from our sed fitting , the resulting ( ill - constrained ) ssfrs are drawn to lower values ( because the majority of models with red optical colors has low ssfrs ) , in better agreement with b04 values , which derive the greater part of their sfr ( the out - of - fiber portion ) from similar optical - only sed fitting .",
    "similar trends are present in galaxies with little or no @xmath3  emission in the fiber ( right panel ) , except that the majority of galaxies have low ssfrs ( log ssfr@xmath132 ) . in this class of galaxies there",
    "exists a peculiar feature : a cloud of galaxies lying @xmath1111 dex above the 1:1 line , having high sed ssfrs ( log ssfr@xmath162 ) , but much lower mpa / jhu ssfrs .",
    "we confirm that these galaxies have robust sed fits and are uv detected . in section [ sec : comp ]",
    "we mentioned that `` no @xmath3 '' galaxies with high ssfrs are probably post - starburst galaxies .",
    "such galaxies are traditionally identified as e+a galaxies , based on their balmer absorption features @xcite .",
    "now we inspect the spectra of @xmath111200 of these outliers and confirm the presence of balmer absorption lines . visually ( @xmath163 composites ) , these galaxies appear like red early - type galaxies , often with white centers , suggesting a central ( post ) starburst .",
    "we match our sample to @xcite catalog of e+a galaxies ( online version updated with sdss dr7 data ) and confirm that the majority of their e+as are found in this region of the plot .",
    "why do the two methods yield discrepant sfrs for these galaxies ? we find that the sed fitting ( s)sfrs of e+a galaxies are very sensitive to the assumed dust attenuation law , more so than the normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "the ( s)sfrs that we obtain for e+as assuming the modified attenuation law are an order of magnitude higher than what would be derived using the nominal calzetti law .",
    "the reduced @xmath7s are 5 times lower when the modified attenuation law is used . from this",
    "we conclude that the high recent ( s)sfrs of e+as that we derive in gswlc are more likely to represent true levels of sf averaged over the last 100 myr .",
    "recent campaigns to obtain resolved spectra with integral - field spectroscopy have reported systematic differences with respect to sfrs from the mpa / jhu catalog .",
    "in particular , @xcite , using preliminary data from the sami galaxy survey @xcite , find a non - linear , i.e. sfr - dependent , relation between their and mpa / jhu sfrs ( which they refer to as b04 sfrs ) , in the sense that galaxies with high sami sfrs have underestimated mpa / jhu sfrs .",
    "the discrepancy is already @xmath164 dex at log sfr@xmath165 , the highest sfrs in their sample ( we convert all sfrs from richards et al .  to chabrier imf ) .",
    "richards et al.attribute the discrepancy to possible biases in b04 methodology for deriving aperture corrections .    in our analysis",
    "so far we have shown that gswlc _ specific _ sfrs of star - forming galaxies have no significant systematics with respect to either mid - ir ssfrs or ssfrs from the mpa / jhu catalog .",
    "this implies , and we confirm it to be true , that mpa / jhu and mid - ir ssfrs agree between themselves as well .",
    "while this seems to imply that mpa / jhu measurements are not biased , it is necessary to verify if such results hold for sfrs , and not just the ssfrs .",
    "figure [ fig : sfr_b04_sami ] shows sed fitting sfrs against mpa / jhu sfrs in the upper panel , and mid - ir sfrs against mpa / jhu sfrs in the lower panel . in both comparisons ,",
    "the linear fits ( blue dashed lines ) follow closely the 1:1 relation .",

    "relation are clearly excluded with either the sed fitting or the mid - ir sfr .",
    "results are unchanged when the redshift range of galaxies is restricted to match the redshift range of sami galaxy survey .",
    "apparently , more work is needed to understand the source of differences .",
    "for now , we conclude that the total mpa / jhu sfrs of actively star - forming galaxies do not appear to be biased when compared with two independent measures of integrated sfr .",
    "all - sky far - ir observations that would enable direct measurement of the total ir luminosity across sdss are only available from relatively shallow _ iras _ and _ akari _ surveys , which preferentially more luminous galaxies @xcite . in order to produce ir luminosity estimates for a significant portion of sdss spectroscopic sample , @xcite apply an artificial neural network ( ann ) technique , using ir luminosities from @xcite as the training set ( these ir luminosities were discussed in section [ sec : wise ] ) .",
    "the idea behind the ann is to establish intrinsic correlations between observable quantities of the training set and the target quantity ( in this case the ir luminosity ) and then apply these correlations to estimate ( `` predict '' ) the target quantity in the full dataset .",
    "the robustness of ann estimates should be tested by comparing them with the independent measurements of the target quantity for an unbiased subsample drawn from the full dataset . in the case of @xcite ,",
    "the parameters employed to estimate the ir luminosities using ann include , in addition to the redshift , the photometric ( magnitudes , colors ) and spectroscopic measurements ( emission lines strengths and d4000 break ) , as well as the stellar mass .",
    "the connection between the fiber and total quantities is established by also including the mass in the fiber and the @xmath26-band fiber covering fraction .",
    "the input parameters come from mpa / jhu dr7 catalog .",
    "the requirement to have available all of the parameters in the target dataset limits the application to 45% of sdss galaxies , typically the ones with stronger emission lines .",
    "ir luminosities of the training set are recovered with the typical accuracy of @xmath166 dex , with no major systematics @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : comp_e16 ] we show the comparison of gswlc ssfrs from the sed fitting against ssfrs converted from @xcite ir luminosities using eq .",
    "[ eq : lir ] .",
    "the comparison is limited to galaxies with @xmath167 , a cut recommended in @xcite to remove the galaxies whose estimated ir luminosities may be uncertain .",
    "@xmath168 essentially measures the degree to which a target galaxy is represented in the training set .",
    "the larger the value , the less likely the target galaxy is represented in the training set and its ir luminosity may therefore be uncertain .",
    "the application of the cut on @xmath168 decreases the number of galaxies with ann ir luminosities from 330,000 to 250,000 , or 1/3 of sdss .",
    "the comparison of ssfrs of star - forming galaxies ( left panel ) shows good general agreement , with mild non - linearity ( slope of 1.23 ) , which can be traced to the differences between _ wise _  and _ herschel - wise _ specific ir luminosities ( section [ sec : wise ] ) .",
    "if the galaxies with @xmath169 were included in the comparison , the scatter at high ssfrs would increase , presumably because such galaxies are rare in the training set .",
    "ann ir luminosities are available for 77% of galaxies in this class ( after the application of @xmath168 cut ) , which is higher than the _ wise _  detection rate of 63% .    for galaxies classified as agn ( the middle panel ) , the correlation is present when log ssfr@xmath170 , but with ann ssfrs tending to be higher , especially for galaxies with high ssfr .",
    "below log ssfr@xmath171 there is no correlation .",
    "both of these behaviors mimic the comparison of sed fitting ssfrs with mid - ir ssfrs ( section [ sec : comp ] and figure [ fig : comp_wise ] , middle panel ) .",
    "excess ssfr for agns with higher ssfrs , which in the case of mid - ir ssfrs we attributed to agn dust heating , is somewhat surprising , because it would be expected that the agn contribution , which drops above 40 @xmath1 @xcite , will be significantly diminished in the total ir luminosity .",
    "however , we remind the reader that ann luminosities are trained on ir luminosities derived from a combination of 22 @xmath1 flux ( which is subject to agn contamination ) and three sub - mm flux points that lie well beyond the ir sed peak ( and are therefore not as sensitive to the current sf , and more to the cold dust mass ) .",
    "more detailed analysis on the contribution of type 2 agn to ir sed lies outside of the scope of this paper .",
    "after the application of @xmath168 cut , the ir luminosities from @xcite are available for only 1% of galaxies having weak or no @xmath3  ( right panel ) . for a handful of such objects with high ssfrs ( including",
    "confirmed e+as ) the match between the sed fitting and ann ssfrs is good , but for the great majority , the ann ir luminosities , when interpreted as sfrs , tend to be too high because of the dust heating from older stars , as already discussed in section [ sec : comp ] .",
    "considering the very different methods of estimating the ir luminosities , it is interesting to see how the ann ir luminosities from @xcite compare to the ones we obtain from _ wise_. this is shown in figure [ fig : comp_lir_e16 ] , for all galaxies for which the two measurements are available ( and with @xmath167 cut applied ) .",
    "the comparison , extending over three orders of magnitude , is fairly good , both in terms of offset and the scatter ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "some systematic differences are present , especially at @xmath173 , which is not surprising considering that the training set peters out at those luminosities .",
    "overall , the ir luminosities from @xcite represent remarkably good estimates considering that they were determined from optical properties alone , but their use as sfrs is subject to the same caveats ( agn dust heating and breakdown for passive galaxies ) as the sfr obtained from _ wise _  mid - ir data .      in section [ sec :",
    "wise ] we mention that new sed fitting codes allow the modeling of the sed to extend into the ir , by including the dust emission .",
    "this approach is used in magphys @xcite , which models the ir sed as a sum of various sed components , the relative contribution of which is mildly related to galaxy s ssfr .",
    "cigale allows the ir sed to be modeled according to one of the four published template sets , without constraints on the shape . in both cases",
    "the dust luminosity ( i.e. , the total ir luminosity ) is normalized to match the stellar emission absorbed in the uv / optical / near - ir .",
    "such ir luminosity will therefore include dust heating from stars of all ages .",
    "stellar plus dust emission modeling is applied in @xcite , who use magphys to perform the sed fitting simultaneously on optical ( @xmath158 ) photometry from sdss and mid - ir photometry from _ wise _  ( 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22 @xmath1 ) . of these 9 bands ,",
    "all but the longest two _ wise _",
    "bands will be dominated by the stellar emission .",
    "emission at 12 and 22 @xmath1 , if detected , will help constrain the dust luminosity and therefore the sfr ( if the dust is primarily heated by young stars ) .",
    "we follow the analysis established in previous sections , and in figure [ fig : comp_c15 ] present comparisons between our sed fitting ssfrs and ssfrs from @xcite , again split by galaxy type .",
    "note that we normalize both ssfrs using our stellar mass .",
    "galaxies classified as star - forming on the bpt diagram ( left panel ) compare well , but show a tail of anomalously low values of chang et al .",
    "ssfrs , which causes the best fit line to deviate from unity .",
    "however , if the tail is excluded , the non - linearity disappears , and a small bulk offset of 0.09 dex remains .",
    "we find that the offset is entirely due to @xmath174 galaxies that are not detected at 22 @xmath1 but only at 12 @xmath1 , for which chang et al .",
    "( s)sfrs are on average 0.17 dex lower than our sed fitting ( s)sfrs . for galaxies with 22 @xmath1 detection ,",
    "the scatter with respect to sed ssfrs is 0.17 dex , compared to 0.23 dex between sed ssfrs and ssfrs from _ wise _  22 @xmath1 alone ( figure [ fig : comp_wise ] , left panel ) .",
    "this reduction of scatter demonstrates that the 12 @xmath1 photometry ( a wavelength at which _ wise _  is significantly more sensitive than to 22 @xmath1 ) helps constrain the sfrs compared to when 22 @xmath1 is used alone .",
    "however , when 12 @xmath1 is used to obtain the ir luminosity ( or sfr ) without the 22 @xmath1 measurements , it leads to a systematic underestimate .    for agn hosts ( the middle panel ) , the tail of anomalously low ssfr values is more extensive than for the star - forming galaxies .",
    "we confirm that these galaxies have uv detections , and that the uv emission drives ssfr estimate in our sed fitting to higher values than when the uv is omitted from the sed fitting , as in the case of @xcite sed fitting .",
    "uv is not expected to be contaminated by non - stellar emission in these , type 2 , agn .",
    "furthermore , the uv emission is extended , suggestive of sf .",
    "optical colors alone are not sensitive to such low levels of sf @xcite , and are equally red for truly quiescent galaxies and those with intermediate ssfrs @xcite .",
    "when the sed fitting is performed without uv constraints , the ssfr defaults to very low values of the majority of optically red models    for agn hosts with high ssfrs , the excess seen in other ir - based ssfrs is now smaller .",
    "this is true whether the galaxy was detected at both 12 and 22 @xmath1 , or just at 12 @xmath1 , suggesting that 12 @xmath1 flux is much less affected by agn - heated hot dust than the 22 @xmath1 , so that when included in the sfr estimate it mitigates the excess . that 22 @xmath1 suffers more agn contamination is corroborated by the fact that out of 12 @xmath1-detected agn ,",
    "80% are also detected at 22 @xmath1 , whereas this fraction was 60% for star - forming galaxies .",
    "previously , @xcite have found that the 12 @xmath1 luminosity is not affected by agn contribution in all but the handful of most luminous sources ( but they did not perform analogous assessment of 22 @xmath1 emission ) .    for galaxies with weak or no @xmath3  ( right panel ) , @xcite values agree well for some of the galaxies with high ssfrs , with a small offset that we attribute to the preponderance ( 90% ) of 12 @xmath1-only detections in this category , which we have shown to have somewhat underestimated sfrs in chang et al . as in the case of comparison with mpa / jhu catalog sfrs , the e+as , or more generally , the post - starburst galaxies , again",
    "form a cloud of points offset from the 1:1 relation . as discussed in section [ ssec : comp_b04 ] , the offset in ( s)sfrs is attributable to the differences in the assumed dust attenuation laws , to which the e+as appear to be particularly sensitive .",
    "comparison with entirely independent ir sfrs as well as better quality of sed fits , suggest that the high ( s)sfrs obtained with the modified attenuation law in gswlc are more realistic .",
    "finally , for galaxies in `` no @xmath3 '' class with log ssfr@xmath2 the estimates largely agree , but are quite uncertain .",
    "the general conclusion is that @xcite sfrs are reliable for galaxies with log ssfr@xmath175 , regardless of the galaxy type , and especially when a galaxy is detected at 22 @xmath1 . when ssfrs are low , @xcite correctly attribute the mid - ir emission to old populations and not the ongoing sf .",
    "however , in doing so , the weak signal from the actual sf , detectable in the uv , is in some cases lost , leading to anomalously low values of ssfr .",
    "@xcite provide an estimate of the dust luminosity , i.e. , the total ir luminosity . in figure",
    "[ fig : comp_lir_c15 ] , we compare it to the ir luminosity that we derive from _ wise _  22 @xmath1 .",
    "there is a good overall agreement and the scatter is smaller than in the comparison involving @xcite @xmath55 , no doubt because _ wise _  and chang et al .",
    "ir luminosities are somewhat correlated through the use of the same 22 @xmath1 photometry .",
    "there is , however , a small fraction ( 1.8% ) of galaxies for which there is a @xmath176 dex discrepancy in @xmath55 .",
    "these galaxies produce a bump in the distribution of specific luminosities ( log @xmath177 ) ) when using @xcite ir luminosities , but not with _ wise_values .",
    "most of these galaxies do not have @xmath55 from @xcite catalog , but when they do , their agree with our ir luminosity from _ wise_. finally , the direct comparison of chang et al.ir luminosities with ir luminosities from _",
    "herschel _ ( plot not shown ) confirms that chang et al .",
    "ir luminosities are underestimated when they are based on 12 @xmath1 detection without the 22 @xmath1 detection .",
    "the paper presents gswlc , an extensive catalog of physical parameters ( sfrs , dust attenuations and stellar masses ) of @xmath111700,000 sdss galaxies covered by _ galex _",
    "( 90% of sdss ) .",
    "sfrs and stellar masses were derived using state - of - the art sed fitting of uv and optical fluxes .",
    "sfrs derived independently from 22 @xmath1 _ wise _  photometry are also included in the catalog .      1 .",
    "the principal source of bias in _ galex _  uv photometry is from blending of unresolved sources .",
    "we provide empirical recipe to reduce its effect .",
    "total ir luminosities obtained from _ wise _  22 @xmath1 observations via @xcite luminosity - dependent templates agree remarkably well ( @xmath178 dex , 0.07 dex of scatter ) with ir luminosities obtained from _ wise _  22 @xmath1 and _ herschel_-spire sub - mm bands . 3 .",
    "the comparison of sed ssfrs with ssfrs from the mid - ir and , separately , with @xmath3  ssfrs , suggests that the majority of galaxies require dust attenuation curve that is significantly steeper than the @xcite curve , and is on average similar to the @xcite curve . allowing this steep attenuation curve to include",
    "a uv bump further improves the quality of uv / optical sed fits .",
    "not accounting for the emission lines in the sed modeling of broadband uv - optical photometry produces significant biases in the derived ( s)sfrs : up to 0.5 dex , on average , for high - ssfr galaxies ( log ssfr@xmath179 ) .",
    "stellar masses are not affected by emission lines .",
    "sfrs and stellar masses are not very different ( @xmath37 dex ) when assuming a smooth , delayed sf history as opposed to the two - component ( old and new ) exponentially declining sf history , adopted for gswlc .",
    "fixing the old component to have started in the early universe ( @xmath180 gyr ) , as done here , yields 0.1 dex higher masses for galaxies with active sf , possibly removing the `` outshining '' bias .",
    "6 .   for actively star - forming ( `` main '' ) sequence galaxies ( log ssfr@xmath149 )",
    ", there is a good general agreement between sed fitting and mid - ir ( s)sfr from gswlc and also with ( s)sfrs from the literature .",
    "aperture - corrected ( total ) sfrs from the mpa / jhu catalog @xcite have no systematics at high sfrs when compared with any other sfr , in contrast to systematic offsets reported in integral - field spectroscopy studies .",
    "gswlc , by offering two independent sfrs can potentially be used in the forthcoming integral - field spectroscopy studies to elucidate the source of the discrepancy .",
    "ir luminosities of galaxies that host agn ( as identified from the bpt diagram ) and have relatively high ssfrs , appear to have an excess ir emission , presumably due to agn dust heating affecting the 22 @xmath1 flux .",
    "if interpreted as sfr , this excess ir luminosity leads to ssfr overestimates of 0.20.6 dex , with greater effect at higher ssfr .",
    "9 .   for galaxies that lie below the star - forming main sequence ( @xmath181log ssfr@xmath132 ) , which includes quenching , nearly quiescent , or rejuvenated galaxies , ssfrs",
    "are low and their determination is challenging by any method . using simple ( fixed factor ) conversions of ir luminosity to sfr ( intended for use with actively star - forming galaxies )",
    "produces greatly exaggerated ( s)sfrs ( up to 2 dex ) .",
    "( s)sfrs from the uv / optical sed fitting tend to retain sensitivity in this regime .",
    "below log ssfr@xmath182 ( for gswlc - m ; @xmath183 for gswlc - a , @xmath184 for gswlc - d ) , even the uv / optical ssfrs should be considered as upper limits , as these are , for all practical purposes , truly quiescent galaxies .",
    "sdss is the workhorse dataset for many galaxy evolution studies at low redshift , but without surveys in other wavelengths it has been limited in terms of characterizing the sf .",
    "we hope that gswlc , by combining sdss with _",
    "galex _  and _ wise _ , will fill this gap and serve as a resource for many new discoveries .",
    "the construction of gswlc was funded through nasa adap award nnx12ae06 g .",
