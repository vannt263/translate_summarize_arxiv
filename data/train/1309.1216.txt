    "adaptive optics ( ao ) systems have proven essential in opening key new areas of astronomical research by compensating for atmospheric blurring to achieve diffraction - limited infrared imaging and spectroscopy . the successful development of ao capabilities on the world",
    "s large - aperture telescopes over the past two decades is a scientific achievement of a large and dedicated instrumentation community .",
    "the palomar adaptive optics system ( palm-241 ) on the 5.1-m hale telescope at palomar mountain  @xcite has been a leader in astronomical ao , providing facility - class on - sky operation since december 1999 .",
    "the instrument , jointly - developed by jet propulsion laboratory and caltech , was used to obtain data contributing to @xmath6 refereed astronomical journal articles while facilitating extensive ao technology development .",
    "the advantages of accessible site , moderate altitude , and excellent engineering support infrastructure have supported the on - sky deployment of many innovations : the first high - speed ao telemetry recording system  @xcite , the now widespread scimeasure high - speed wavefront sensor camera  @xcite , the first high - order natural guide star ( ngs ) shack - hartmann simultaneous multiple star wavefront sensor  @xcite , demonstrations of sparse matrix  @xcite , hierarchical  @xcite , efficient recursive  @xcite and fourier transform based slope sensor reconstructors  @xcite , ao - assisted ` lucky ' imaging at visible wavelengths  @xcite , vector - vortex coronagraph  @xcite , non - redundant mask interferometry  @xcite , and three years of solid - state sum - frequency 589  nm laser guide star operations  @xcite including the demonstration of back pumping and frequency chirping techniques that increase the efficiency of photoreturn from earth s mesospheric sodium layer  @xcite .",
    "palm-241 achieved infrared k - band imaging strehl ratios under median seeing conditions of 11 as high as 73% as measured using point spread function fitting photometry @xcite .",
    "exposures of at least 30 seconds are needed with our instrumentation to estimate infrared strehl ratios properly , accounting for the faint , extended contribution of the point spread function halo .",
    "assuming marechal s approximation @xcite , this is an equivalent rms wavefront error of 195  nm . using a centrally - projected guide star laser emitting up to 8 w of 589  nm sodium @xmath7 light to form a mesospheric synthetic beacon ,",
    "palm-241 achieved 48% k - band imaging strehl as part of a laser proof - of - concept demonstration science program @xcite .    since the initial discovery of a confirmed substellar object at palomar observatory @xcite , low - mass objects have been a focus of direct imaging searches and have motivated the palomar ao program . despite excellent performance and successful investigations of brown dwarf companions ,",
    "the ability of palm-241 to directly image stellar companion exoplanets using the full 5.1-m aperture was limited to a contrast of @xmath2@xmath8 at 05 by imperfect complex amplitude correction of the electromagnetic field at the coronagraphic occulting mask , resulting in residual semi - static stellar speckles @xcite .",
    "these speckles would vary in amplitude as well as contribute photon noise in the focal plane .",
    "improving exoplanet imaging capabilities beyond these limitations , to approach the theoretical limits for ground - based exoplanet study @xcite , required a combination of improved calibration , post - processing techniques , and capability of the ao system .",
    "palm-3000 is the second - generation astronomical ao system for the hale telescope .",
    "it has been engineered specifically to optimize high - contrast studies of exoplanets orbiting nearby bright stars when used in conjunction with specialized speckle - suppressing instrumentation , including p1640 @xcite , the palomar high - angular resolution observer ( pharo ) @xcite , and the palomar fiber nuller ( pfn ) @xcite .",
    "the combination of palm-3000 and p1640 , in particular , is expected to reach @xmath9 detection contrast ratios as high as @xmath5 at an angular radius of 10  and @xmath8 at 03 after application of speckle suppression algorithms exploiting the coherent integral field spectroscopic data cube available with p1640 .",
    "to date , our team has conducted commissioning observations with palm-3000 and five visible and near - infrared science instruments . in particular , we have quantified the benefit of the speckle suppression technique using p1640 , in terms of the faintest companion that can be detected with @xmath10 confidence as a function of separation from a star .",
    "initial observations achieved a contrast of @xmath11 at 05 angular separation from an occulted star @xcite , suitable for detecting luminous sub - stellar companions , though our integrated system is not yet at full performance awaiting improved instrument calibration and ao performance improvements .",
    "future studies will report on the results of our optimization activities .",
    "the direct imaging discovery of planetary mass companions to hr 8799 @xcite and fomalhaut @xcite with orbital radii of tens of au has inaugurated a new era in the study of exoplanets .",
    "radial velocity and transit detection techniques , so fruitful for exoplanet discovery , are currently only sensitive to detection of a strongly - irradiated class of planets orbiting close in to their host stars . fully mature high - contrast direct imaging campaigns , on the other hand ,",
    "will be sensitive to companions at large separations and will probe a critical region of the exoplanetary parameter space .",
    "direct imaging studies will allow us to address questions about solar system architectures by evaluating the frequency of companions undetectable by radial velocity and transit methods .",
    "even a flat extrapolation of the semi - major axis distribution of radial - velocity detected exoplanets beyond 3 - 5 au foreshadows a large population of undetected planets around nearby stars @xcite .",
    "in addition , the increasing frequency of planet masses discovered through radial velocity techniques below about 4 @xmath12 suggests a large population of lower mass planets exist around nearby stars .",
    "moreover , high - contrast imaging campaigns will further constrain our understanding of the distribution of brown dwarf masses and their frequency around a variety of host stars .",
    "high - contrast integral field spectrographs ( ifs ) will allow study of massive exoplanets in detail , tackling questions about their internal physics , structure , and atmospheric chemistry",
    ".    a survey has been designed @xcite to search for and characterize exoplanets during 99 nights of dedicated observing with palm-3000 and p1640 .",
    "motivated by the correlation between planet frequency and the mass of the host star @xcite , the survey will target approximately 220 stellar systems having a and f - type stars , a population expected to host exoplanets 5 times as often as their lower mass counterparts .",
    "indeed , two of the first imaged exoplanet systems , hr 8799 and fomalhaut , have a - type hosts .",
    "a secondary survey will also be performed of stars within 25 pc with visual magnitude v @xmath13 7 establishing a complete census of wide - orbit candidates .",
    "already , palm-3000 and the p1640 instrument have obtained simultaneous infrared spectra of the hr8799 giant planets @xcite , moving exoplanet study into a spectrographic science . with the expected final adaptive optics performance of palm-3000 (  [ sec : predicted_performance ] ) we will be able to observe upwards of 90% of the planets of greater than 7 jupiter masses orbiting the stars in our sample @xcite .",
    "this survey will comprehensively determine whether the theorized brown dwarf desert @xcite exists .",
    "depending on the true fraction of stars harboring exoplanets , we will additionally obtain low - resolution spectra of several planet - mass objects in each of several distinctly different age bins .      a comprehensive picture of the formation of planets",
    "can only be obtained with a thorough understanding of the structure and evolution of the circumstellar disks from which they evolve .",
    "after 5 - 10 myr , most of the gas content of the primordial , massive and optically - thick circumstellar disk has been cleared away @xcite , accreted onto the star itself , formed into planetary bodies , or dispersed via stellar radiation .",
    "stars exiting this primordial phase possess a much less massive optically - thin disk , mostly containing second - generation grains , formed by the collisional fragmentation of larger bodies .",
    "iras and spitzer have detected hundreds of debris disks by their far - infrared excesses , but only a dozen images of optically thin disks are currently available ( see circumstellardisks.org for an up - to - date list ) .",
    "multi - wavelength resolved imaging is a necessary complement to the infrared spectral energy distribution analysis to remove degeneracies between grain morphology , temperature distribution , and grain size .",
    "the range and values of these parameters frame the conditions for planet formation .",
    "furthermore , the most prominent disk structures ( e.g. warp , annulus , asymmetries ) match the predicted dynamical effects based on the characteristics of embedded planets . the hubble space telescope has been a prime observatory for high - contrast imaging at short wavelengths ( @xmath14 @xmath4 m ) for a decade , thanks to the acs and nicmos coronagraphs despite the large radii of their coronagraphic obscurations , i.e. large inner working angle ( iwa ) , 09 for acs , 05 for nicmos .",
    "unfortunately these two exceptional instruments are no longer in service .",
    "the james webb telescope will provide only modest short wavelength capabilities , as it will not be diffraction limited in the short near - ir and red visible bands where palm-3000 will perform best .",
    "using both p1640 ( simultaneously recording both j and h band spectra ) and pharo ( providing k band imagery ) , palm-3000 will look across @xmath15 @xmath4 m at known and yet - to - be identified spatially resolved debris disks at small iwa s , where warmer dust is likely to reside and where rocky planet formation is likely to occur ( 1 - 10 au ) .",
    "imaging such spatial scales is necessary to understand the interaction between the debris disk and planetary bodies , as well as the implications for planetary formation mechanisms .",
    "palm-3000 will also characterize bright new candidates from the latest spitzer and herschel surveys .",
    "the sensitivity in h and k bands will be background - limited to 17 - 16 mag / arcsec@xmath16 , respectively , which will allow imaging of brighter circumstellar disks around young stars , those having a ratio of infrared luminosity relative to their host star @xmath17 at high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "palm-3000 retains the unique off - axis subaperture mode of palm-241 @xcite .",
    "when used with the visible fast - frame imaging camera tmas ( table  [ tab : instruments ] ) and a vector - vortex coronagraphic mask @xcite , it will be possible to obtain high - contrast visible - light images of circumstellar material for guide stars of v @xmath13 2.5 .",
    "this high - contrast parameter space at extremely small iwa is largely unexplored and may include the possibility of detecting the first exoplanet in reflected light @xcite .",
    "simulations of this mode using the wave - optics propagation software paola @xcite indicate an r - band strehl ratio of @xmath18 90% is possible in good seeing conditions at palomar , far exceeding reported visible - light coronagraphic rejection to date @xcite .",
    "because the monte - carlo based models of the frequency and distribution of detectable reflection exoplanets indicates the total number of detectable reflection exoplanets will be very limited @xcite , this mode is best considered a technique for targeted studies of known objects identified through radial velocity or transit photometry discovery .",
    "similarly , contrast of better than @xmath11 at an angular separation less than 02 has exciting possibilities for new studies of stellar astrophysics such as direct imaging of herbig - halo outflows @xcite , mira stars @xcite , and supergiant environments .",
    "palm-3000 uses the same pair of matched palm-241 off - axis parabolic ( oap ) mirrors to retain a compact 1-to-1 magnification optical relay  @xcite .",
    "this economical design was adopted because of the need to reuse the palm-241 deformable mirror within palm-3000 ( section [ deformablemirrors ] ) and to respect the volume constraints within the cassegrain cage environment of the hale telescope .",
    "these oaps were specified with @xmath19/20 peak - to - valley surface quality over 90% of their clear aperture and have been recoated without refiguring twice since 1997 .",
    "reuse of the oaps also retains the same 112 mm diameter internal relay pupil . the optical layout and a description of the palm-3000 optical paths is shown in figure [ p3k_layout ] .",
    "palm-3000 uses two xinetics , inc .",
    "deformable mirrors sequentially within a collimated optical space to apply appropriate optical phase corrections .",
    "this architectural choice was necessitated by the relatively low 1.06 @xmath20 actuator stroke of the dense high - order deformable mirror relative to the turbulence - induced requirement for total surface stroke ( @xmath21 ) of 4.1  @xmath20 in conditions where @xmath22  cm  @xcite at @xmath19 = 500  nm , corresponding to seeing of 112 full - width at half - maximum .",
    "the combination of high - spatial - frequency , small - stroke correction from the high - order deformable mirror ( hodm ) and lower - spatial - frequency , larger - stroke correction from the low - order deformable mirror ( lodm ) allows palm-3000 to correct most atmospheric conditions observed at palomar mountain ( in the worst seeing conditions , the finite total mirror stroke available eventually limits correction capability . )",
    "summary properties of the high - order deformable mirror and low - order deformable mirror are shown in table [ tab : dms ] .",
    "the palm-3000 lodm is the original palm-241 dm349  @xcite , which has been in routine use since 1999 .",
    "it was stripped and recoated on one occasion in 2003 , an operation that involved removal of the mirror facesheet . in terms of operational reliability",
    ", this mirror has seen approximately 500 nights of scheduled science usage .",
    "assuming 50% open - shutter time ( year - round ) and average operation at 1khz update rate , this mirror has seen @xmath0 7.5  gcycles @xmath1 241 active actuators @xmath0 1.8 trillion actuator - updates in science use .",
    "we estimate that including laboratory time , @xmath0 8.4 trillion actuator - updates have been made without a single failure at the actuator level .",
    "this reliability data , along with similarly experiences at other observatories , is now able to inform design decisions for future generation astronomical ao systems .",
    "the hodm is the largest format astronomical deformable mirror to date , having 66 @xmath1 66 physical actuators organized into 6 @xmath1 6 actuator modules containing 11 @xmath1 11 actuators each .",
    "the actuators are made of electrostrictive lead magnesium niobate ( pmn ) and are spaced by 1.8  mm center - to - center with 0.15  mm gaps between the actuators .",
    "a 0.2  mm thick glass facesheet is attached to the actuators .",
    "the mirror has 3,388 active actuators within a circular clear aperture of 117  mm in diameter .",
    "the ao relay produces a 114-mm pupil which fully illuminates 63 wavefront sensor subapertures when used in @xmath23 mode ( spanning 64 hodm actuators in a pupil - matching fried geometry ) . the entire dm housing ( excluding external wiring )",
    "is 23 @xmath1 23 @xmath1 13.2  cm .",
    "the nominal 0 - 100  v range for actuation is limited by the xinetics - provided dm drive electronics to @xmath24 30  v about a + 40  v bias signal , which was found experimentally to put the hodm near the center of its linear range .",
    "the drive electronics overall require 55 a of continuous current , 90  a peak , necessitating the installation of auxiliary 120  v power capacity to the cassegrain environment .    during acceptance testing ,",
    "the best controlled hodm self - flattening achieved was 11  nm rms of residual surface error  @xcite . assuming that spatial frequencies of 8 cycles or less across the pupil are corrected by the lodm , then the hodm stroke required to self - flatten , in the lab , was achieved using less than 5% rms of the available hodm stroke , with a few individual hodm actuators using up to 25% of their range .",
    "although the hodm represents a significant prototyping achievement for xinetics , inc .",
    "there were imperfections created during the manufacturing process which affect the surface figure . because the actuators are closely spaced and made of an electrically active material , the entire grid of actuators was dipped in a conformal coating prior to attaching the facesheet . during initial polish of the completed mirror , polishing slurry leaked into the area between the actuators , causing either the conformal coating or the facesheet bonding adhesive to absorb moisture and wick between the actuators . when sent to vacuum aluminization , the offensive material dried out and",
    "was fixed in place between actuators .",
    "thus , as the material absorbs or releases moisture , it expands and contracts . because the actuators are rigidly attached , the inter - actuator dimensional change results in highly local deformations in the facesheet .",
    "the stroke of the majority the actuators has not been compromised , but for a group located along the bottom edge of the hodm , 18 actuators have been found to be restricted to less than half the nominal actuator stroke ( 8 of which are inscribed within our useful pupil ) .",
    "a complete solution to this problem would require removal of the facesheet and an attempt to clean the unwanted material from between the actuators .",
    "in addition to risking the facesheet , this would have risked permanent damage the actuators . as an alternative mitigation",
    ", we elected to have the facesheet repolished under strict humidity control and implemented a passive relative humidity ( rh ) control system , sealing the hodm case and using a specially - formulated passive , two - way 30% rh maintaining humidipak ( now boveda ) coupled to an rh monitoring system .",
    "results from initial winter operation indicate the hodm puckers may additionally be temperature dependent , even with controlled rh , but this remains under investigation .    during early science observations , the high - spatial - frequency nature of the hodm deformations",
    "has been confirmed to move additional stellar light outside the hodm control region , beyond 16 ) .",

    "to enable an effectively continuous selectable frame rate , the detector controller can be programmed with an adjustable delay time between the readout of the last pixel in the frame storage area and the execution of the frame transfer .",

    "the system experiences significant pupil shifts in response to changes in telescope declination , thus the reconstructor must be periodically re - identified throughout the course of an observing period . to facilitate this process , palm-3000 possesses a unified reconstructor pipeline that autonomously gathers current telescope data and computes a new reconstructor matrix .    the telescope operator initiates the computation by calling the reconstructor pipeline script .",
    "the script is structured such that pertinent reconstructor parameters can be specified if desired , however the default parameters are typically sufficient and no further input from the user is required .",

    "all 10 pcs are interconnected using a quadrics qsnetii 16-port switch that delivers over 900 mb / s of user space to user space bandwidth each direction with latency under 2 microseconds for a total of 14.4 gb / s of bisectional bandwidth and broadcast capability .",
    "high - bandwidth ao telemetry data , such as wavefront sensor pixel data , as well as latency - sensitive data such as hodm commands , are transferred using fiber optics .",
    "low - bandwidth data , such as acquisition camera pixels and electronics hardware status , are sent from the servo pc to the database pc via a dedicated 1gbit ethernet .",
    "long latency - tolerant commands , such as those issued by the servo pc to stepper motors and lamps are sent via direct connections .",
    "the measured mean processing latency of the wavefront reconstruction based on a full matrix vector multiplication using the input matrix of 4096 actuator values by 8192 centroid values and 2 @xmath1 2 pixel centroiding has been measured to consist of the following terms : 94 @xmath4s for centroiding and vector - matrix - multiply in parallel on 8 pcs , 41 @xmath4s transfer of partial residuals to combining pc , 70 @xmath4s for servo calculation setting the new actuator commands , 35 @xmath4s for software inter - actuator voltage check to protect the hodm from potentially damaging strain ( reducible to 10 @xmath4s via faster algorithm ) , 125 @xmath4s communication through the dm interface board ( reducible to 25 @xmath4s by reimplementing the curtiss - wright driver ourselves ) , and 50 @xmath4s inter - actuator voltage check in fpga hardware .",
    "start - of - data to end - of - data delay was confirmed at 475 @xmath4s + - 25 @xmath4s jitter .",
    "in addition 30 @xmath4s of frame transfer delay in the wavefront sensor controller .",
    "latency is measured from the falling edge of start of frame signal ( e.g. the end of frame transition ) on the little joe camera transmitting cameralink card , to the 50% transition point of an actuator s drive voltage and does not include the camera integration time .",
    "measurement via oscilloscope has shown this latency to be 956 microseconds for 1,250 - 2,000 hz frame rate readout and 1280 microseconds for camera readout in the range of 300 - 1249 hz .",
    "the mean compute latency in the real - time controller has been benchmarked at 415 microseconds , with standard deviation of 30 microseconds .",
    "the hodm driver is specified for a 3 a current limit .",
    "the rise time of a single actuator , settling to within 5% of a 300  nm step function , was measured to be 20 @xmath4s , consistent with this current limit .",
    "the hodm driver latency , measured from the sending of a digital command to the setting of the actuator voltage , was found to be 60 @xmath4s .",
    "both of these measurements confirm the design specifications of our drive electronics .",
    "non - common - path static wavefront calibration for palm-3000 is implemented via an interface allowing for the loading of element slope offset vectors in the appropriate pupil mode which represents the target command point in the real - time ao wavefront reconstruction .",
    "these slope offsets , represented internally in shack - hartmann sensor pixel coordinates , are generated via different techniques depending on the science camera undergoing calibration .",
    "for pharo , we use a modified iterative gerscherg - saxton phase diversity algorithm to achieve wavefront calibration to better than 40  nm rms phase error @xcite . for p1640 , an electric field measuring calibration interferometer has so far achieved approximately 14  nm wavefront error @xcite .",
    "prior to palm-3000 development , the hale telescope at palomar had no capacity to provide instrumentation with facility liquid cooling .",
    "experimental investigation of the palm-241 system , which dissipated a total of 1.5 kw below the primary mirror determined this heat flow led to an approximately @xmath52c temperature rise in the area of the primary mirror directly above the dissipating electronics . while not directly detrimental to palm-241 observations , the thermal inertia of the primary mirror demonstrated residual surface distortions for up to 40 hours , degrading some non - ao operations , particularly after comprehensive refurbishment of the hale primary mirror back supports improved seeing - limited image quality in 2009 .",
    "as the palm-3000 ao system dissipates approximately 7 kw during hodm operation , the project and palomar staff jointly undertook the addition of a liquid cooling system to remove heat from the electronics in the cassegrain cage area .",
    "the new cooling system comprises a primary facility chiller in conjunction with a secondary process chiller , which circulates coolant to multiple fan tray heat exchangers operating within each rack .",
    "the facility chiller ejects its heat through an exhaust tunnel which is vented a sufficient distance from the telescope dome . the diluted glycol coolant is currently conveyed to the cassegrain cage by way of a draped umbilical cord , which also provides additional electrical power and fiber data lines required for palm-3000 . despite the additional torque of the draped umbilical , no noticeable change to the telescope pointing performance has been found after a routine pointing model recalibration",
    "palm-3000 has thus far been commissioned with five science instruments as summarized in table  [ tab : instruments ] .",
    "the range of science capability provided by the diverse palm-3000 instrument suite includes direct near - infrared and visible imaging , slit - based near - infrared grism spectroscopy , moderate visible resolution and low near - infrared resolution integral field spectroscopy , coronagraphy , and near - infrared nulling interferometry .",

    "palm-3000 is capable of minimizing the residual wavefront error for guide stars that range in brightness by over a factor of @xmath57 through adjusting the combination of wavefront sensor pupil sampling , camera frame rate , and servo control modes .",
    "naturally , the delivered level of wavefront correction over this broad range of guide star brightness varies significantly .",
    "insight into the intrinsic wavefront error arising from input guide star photon noise , temporal delay due to finite integration time , and finite spatial correction bandwidth as a function of theoretical continuous pupil sampling density , @xmath32 ( samples per pupil diameter ) , is shown in figure [ tab : performanceprediction ] .",
    "palm-3000 has adopted a strategy of performing the highest bandwidth tip - tilt correction using the relatively limited stroke of the lodm , coupled to a moderate - speed offload through the servo control law to the independent , large - stroke tip - tilt mirror .",
    "the -3db tip - tilt rejection bandwidth of the tip - tilt mirror direct loop has been measured to be 18 hz , while that of the cascaded approach is expected upon full implementation to achieve @xmath18 40 hz . because the typical fast stroke usage of the lodm for tip - tilt correction is only a few hundred nanometers rms , there is generally little impact to the available stroke for higher - mode corrections , though the impact of spurious tilt events to lodm stability remains under investigation .",

    "on the nights of june 20 - 22 , 2011 , the combination of lodm and hodm correction was initially applied to a stellar source . in visible ( @xmath61 @xmath20 ) seeing of 09 , palm-3000 achieved a first - light k - band strehl ratio of 79% as measured by 30-s exposures in the pharo imaging camera , exceeding the highest strehl ever obtained with palm-241 .",
    "this corresponded to an effective wavefront error of 170  nm rms .",
    "several recognized limitations were known at the time , such as our having only partially implemented our reconstructor pipeline and not yet fully implemented the mgs calibration algorithm with pharo . during the initial 12 months following our palm-3000 first lock , the ao team was engaged in commissioning back - end science instruments at an average rate of one every three months , limiting the engineering effort available for ao performance optimization .    since june 2012 , palm-3000 performance has steadily improved through detailed analyses referencing against the design error budget .",
    "this process revealed an unexpected chromatic aberration , lateral color , in the high - order wavefront sensor optical relay .",
    "this chromatic magnification error , which varies with guide star effective temperature , induces an effective achromatic focus error in the science beam equivalent to up to 80  nm rms wavefront error if uncompensated .",
    "operationally , we have worked around this issue by using a calibrated focus offset until an optical solution to the lateral color is implemented .",
    "similarly , small flexure - based pupil illumination changes were discovered to impact performance as a function of zenith pointing .",
    "the prompted our team to improve our reconstructor - generating software to automatically incorporates a measured pupil illumination function for different values of zenith pointing .",
    "on - going system optimization has thus far achieved residual wavefront error as low as 141  nm rms on bright guide stars .",
    "this was achieved on ut 26",
    "september 2012 in s64 mode when guiding on the v = 3.41 star , sao 074996 , and observing near zenith in approximately 1.0 arc sec fwhm seeing .",
    "figure [ lodm_only_psf ] shows a long - exposure image ( logarithmic stretch ) of this target in the k@xmath62 filter , under two operating configurations : lodm correction only and combined lodm+hodm correction .",
    "each image consists of a series of pharo images forming total integration of 272 seconds . for the lodm - correction - only image ,",
    "the hodm was set to a fixed optimal figure previously determined using internal calibration sources .",
    "the k@xmath62 strehl ratio is measured using our aforementioned technique to be 72% .",
    "this is somewhat underperforming our error budget prediction for lodm - only operation .",
    "the second image was formed running palm-3000 with concurrent lodm and hodm correction , delivering k@xmath62 strehl ratio of 85% .",
    "the equivalent wavefront error of 141  nm rms still falls short of the design requirement of 105  nm rms on bright stars .",
    "we continue to optimize our woofer / tweeter control law and verify parameters following our error budgets .    in terms of clearing out the point spread function within the iwa ,",
    "the striking advantage of the hodm control is obvious .",
    "any coronagraph optimized to reduce image diffraction , particularly in the range between the outer working angle of the lodm ( 4 @xmath19/d ) and that of the hodm ( 32 @xmath19/d ) , will enjoy the strong benefit of palm-3000 clearing away residual energy from the seeing halo .",
    "note , conditions were exceptionally stable on the night of this test and we have no reason to believe conditions varied appreciably in the  5 minutes that elapsed between these two measurements .",
    "initial investigations of palm-3000 performance vs. guide star brightness have been limited to the initially commissioned @xmath23 mode , as shown in figure [ perfvbrightness ] below . between our initial tests in august 2011 and recent performance in september 2012 ,",
    "a number of the initial limitations to performance have been address , although performance has not yet fully reached the error budget expectation and system optimization continues .",
    "the diffraction limited resolution of the 5.1-m hale telescope is 16  milliarcseconds at 0.4  @xmath4 m wavelength , comparable to the planned thirty - meter telescope resolution in k - band @xcite .",
    "although we expect palm-3000 to achieve low blue - wavelength strehl ratio performance in all but the most favorable seeing conditions , significant improvement can be obtained from short - exposure images using post - processing techniques developed at palomar @xcite and elsewhere .",
    "observations of solar system objects at these high angular resolutions , particularly with swift @xcite , are already underway .",
    "an example of this potential is shown in figure [ ganymede ] , where one hundred 0.5-second exposure images taken on 27 september 2012 of ganymede taken in each of b , r , and i filters have been combined ( hildebrandt et al .",
    "2013 , in preparation ) , without frame selection , into a false - color visual image following wavelet high - pass filter transformation .",
    "in particular , solar system bodies subject to resurfacing , such as io , titan , and triton , may in the future be periodically monitored at this resolution using palm-3000 .",
    "we have reported upon the initial on - sky demonstration of the @xmath23 subaperture correction mode of palm-3000 .",
    "performance optimization in this mode to achieve wavefront errors as low as @xmath63 = 105  nm rms in median seeing are currently underway .",
    "additional work will be required to implement the @xmath33 and @xmath36 pupil sampling modes , while implementation of @xmath38 operation has been indefinitely deferred by current funding limitations .",
    "support of routine science operations has been fully transferred to palomar observatory staff , though engineering optimization for performance and observing efficiency continues through successive releases of additional ao system automation and calibration software .    to date , all published palm-3000 results have been based on the strategy of phase conjugation , which attempts to minimize the delivered science wavefront phase error .",
    "optimized performance for exoplanet contrast , however , will require implementation of full electric field ( phase and amplitude ) correction .",
    "we have implemented both speckle nulling @xcite and electric field conjugation @xcite algorithms for laboratory testing , but on - sky demonstration of these techniques with palm-3000 remains a topic for future publication .",
    "palm-3000 is the key capability at the heart of a multi - dimensional science emphasis on exoplanet discovery and analysis .",
    "used in combination with the p1640 speckle - suppression coronagraph , palm-3000 is the first realized ao system designed to achieve @xmath5 contrast direct imaging and low - resolution near - infrared spectroscopy of exoplanets using a multi - layered approach of high - order adaptive optics , a spatially filtered shack - hartmann wavefront sensor , an apodized - pupil lyot coronagraph , a speckle suppression integral field spectrograph , and nm - level accuracy calibration interferometer producing a dark hole in the stellar speckle field on sky .",
    "our northern survey of a- and f - type stars in now underway . when combined with small iwa = 01 coronagraphs within pharo and tmas",

    "will also probe a unique long - period orbital parameter space for exoplanets around nearby stars , including long - duration radial velocity trend stars identified at keck observatory and elsewhere .",

    "<S> palm-3000 has been engineered for high - contrast imaging and emission spectroscopy of brown dwarfs and large planetary mass bodies at near - infrared wavelengths around bright stars , but also supports general natural guide star use to v @xmath0 17 . using its unique 66 @xmath1 66 actuator deformable mirror , palm-3000 has thus far demonstrated residual wavefront errors of 141  nm rms under @xmath21  seeing conditions . </S>",
    "<S> palm-3000 can provide phase conjugation correction over a 64 @xmath1 64 working region at @xmath3 @xmath4 m , or full electric field ( amplitude and phase ) correction over approximately one half of this field . with optimized back - end instrumentation , palm-3000 </S>",
    "<S> is designed to enable @xmath5 contrast at 1  angular separation , including post - observation speckle suppression processing . while optimization of the adaptive optics system is ongoing , we have already successfully commissioned five back - end instruments and begun a major exoplanet characterization survey , project 1640 , with our partners at american museum of natural history and jet propulsion laboratory . </S>"
