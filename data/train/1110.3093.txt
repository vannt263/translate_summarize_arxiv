    "in recent years , quantum phase transitions @xcite have attracted a lot of attention in condensed matter theory .",
    "quantum phase transitions happen at absolute zero temperature .",
    "they are induced by the change of an external parameter ( pressure , chemical composition , and magnetic field ) and are driven by quantum fluctuations .",
    "a number of metallic systems show strong deviations from conventional landau fermi - liquid properties when they are tuned through a quantum critical point @xcite .",
    "significant attention has also been attracted by phase transitions in the presence of quenched disorder .",
    "it has become clear that at low temperatures , strongly correlated materials can show a surprising sensitivity to imperfections and disorder .",
    "interplay between large - scale quantum fluctuations and random fluctuations due to disorder leads to exotic phenomena such as quantum griffiths singularities @xcite , infinite randomness critical points featuring exponential instead of power - law scaling @xcite and the smearing of the phase transition @xcite .",
    "the griffiths effects are caused by large spatial regions ( rare regions ) that are devoid of impurities and can show local order even if the bulk system is in the disordered phase .",
    "the locally ordered rare regions are not static but retain their quantum dynamics .",
    "griffiths showed that these rare regions can lead to a singularity in the free energy in a whole parameter region which is now known as the griffiths phase . in a _",
    "griffiths phase , the rare - region low - energy density of states follows a power law , @xmath1 , where @xmath0 is the non - universal griffiths exponent .",
    "@xmath0 varies systematically within the griffiths phase and vanishes at the critical point .",
    "this kind of density of states leads to power - law dependencies of several observables on the temperature _ t _ , including specific heat , @xmath2 and magnetic susceptibility , @xmath3 .",
    "the zero - temperature magnetization - field curve behaves as @xmath4 ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . while the thermodynamics of quantum griffiths phases is comparatively well understood , much less",
    "is known about transport properties .",
    "we showed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the rare - region contributions to electrical resistivity , thermal resistivity , thermopower , and the peltier coefficient in the quantum griffiths phase associated with an antiferromagnetic quantum phase transition are characterized by non - universal power - laws in @xmath5 which are controlled by the same griffiths exponent @xmath0 which also governs the thermodynamics . here , we summarize these results .",
    "we then investigate the behaviors in the antiferromagnetic quantum griffiths phase of some of the  universal \" ratios commonly used to characterize fermi - liquid behavior in metals .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we briefly discuss the model and methods of solutions . in sec .",
    "3 we then summarize the derivations of the transport properties and find that the scattering of the electrons by spin - fluctuations in the rare regions leads to singular temperature dependencies not just at the quantum critical point but in the entire antiferromagnetic quantum griffiths phase . in sec .",

    "the transport properties of the itinerant antiferromagnetic systems we are interested in can be described by a two - band model consisting of @xmath6 and @xmath7 electrons @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian has the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the hamiltonians of @xmath6 and @xmath7 electrons , respectively .",
    "only the @xmath6 electrons contribute to the transport properties .",
    "they are scattered by the spin - fluctuations of the @xmath7 electrons which are assumed to be in the antiferromagnetic quantum griffiths phase .",
    "the contribution to the resistivity from the scattering by the spin - fluctuations stems from the @xmath11 exchange interaction term of the hamiltonian @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the coupling between @xmath6 and @xmath7 electrons . *",
    "s * and * s * are the spin densities of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 electrons , respectively .    near the quantum critical point in three dimensions ,",
    "the concept of quasiparticles is still ( marginally ) well defined , therefore transport properties can be treated within a semi - classical boltzmann approach . the linearized boltzmann equation in the presence of a temperature gradient @xmath14 and an electric field @xmath15 but zero magnetic field can be written as @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the equilibrium fermi - dirac distribution function .",
    "the first and second terms describe changes of the electron distribution function @xmath18 due to diffusion and electric field @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the last one is the collision term .",
    "let the stationary solution of the boltzmann equation be @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a measure of the deviation of the electron distribution from equilibrium .",
    "then the linearized scattering term due to the spin - fluctuations has the form @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the bose - einstein distribution function and @xmath23 is the total dynamical susceptibility of the spin - fluctuations ( @xmath7 electrons ) . in the above equation ,",
    "the spin - fluctuations are assumed to be in equilibrium .",
    "this approximation is valid if the system can lose momentum efficiently by umklapp or impurity scattering .",
    "quantum griffiths effects in disordered metallic systems are realized in both heisenberg magnets @xcite and ising magnets . in the latter case",
    ", they occur in a transient temperature range where the damping is unimportant @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we consider both cases .    in order to study the rare - region contribution to the transport properties in the griffiths phase ,",
    "we need to find the total rare - region dynamical susceptibility . to get it",

    "the imaginary part of the dynamical susceptibility of a single cluster of characteristic energy @xmath24 of a disordered itinerant quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet in the quantum griffiths phase is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the moment of the cluster and @xmath27 is the damping coefficient which results from the coupling of the spin - fluctuations and the electrons .",

    ", we can find the resistivity .",
    "close to the antiferromagnetic quantum phase transition , the susceptibility is strongly peaked around the ordering wave vector @xmath48 .",
    "this leads to anisotropic scattering processes .",
    "however , in the presence of a high concentration of impurities , the low temperature resistivity is dominated by elastic impurity scattering which is isotropic .",
    "the isotropic scattering redistributes the electrons over the fermi surface .",
    "this allows us to make the standard ansatz @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a unit vector parallel to the electric field .",
    "note that any constant prefactor in @xmath20 is unimportant because it drops out in the resistivity functional ( [ rhofunc ] ) .",

    "@xcite , we obtain @xmath51    inserting the susceptibility ( [ chi3 ] ) , the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity due to the spin - fluctuations in the griffiths phase is given by @xmath52 up to logarithmic corrections .",
    "thus , the temperature - dependence of the electrical resistivity follows a non - universal power - law governed by the griffiths exponent @xmath0 .      in the same way , we study the thermal resistivity . we find that the rare - region contribution to the thermal resistivity in the antiferromagnetic quantum griffiths phase has the form @xmath53    the seebeck effect , the existence of an electric field @xmath54 in a metal subject to a thermal gradient @xmath55 , is characterized by the thermopower @xmath56 which is defined by the relation @xmath57 . to calculate the thermopower , we analyze the boltzmann equation ( 3 ) in the presence of both @xmath55 and @xmath54 .",
    "elastic impurity scattering leads to the usual linear temperature dependence @xmath58 while the contribution due to the magnetic scattering by the rare regions in the griffiths phase reads @xmath59    another transport coefficient called the peltier coefficient @xmath60 characterizes the flow of a thermal current in a metal in the absence of a thermal gradient .",
    "it is related to the thermopower by @xmath61 correspondingly , the rare - region contribution to the peltier coefficient has the form @xmath62",
