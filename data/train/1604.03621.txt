    "the understanding of the high critical temperature ( @xmath2 ) superconductors based on iron continues attracting the attention of the condensed matter community  @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed that these studies may not only have potential technological applications , but they may also shed light on other high-@xmath2 superconductors such as those based on copper . while early theoretical studies of the iron - based compounds were guided by simple fermi surface nesting ideas that may have captured important properties of these materials such as the symmetry of the superconducting state , more recent investigations are increasingly suggesting that the effect of coulombic repulsion between electrons can not be neglected  @xcite .",
    "for example , there are compounds that are superconducting but do not have hole pockets , and thus no nesting effects , at the fermi surface  @xcite .",
    "there are also materials with robust magnetic local moments even at room temperature  @xcite , in disagreement with weak coupling perspectives where the formation of moments and their long - range order occur simultaneously upon cooling .",
    "moreover , complex spin arrangements have been unveiled in several materials , as recently reviewed  @xcite .",
    "all these results suggest that repulsive interactions between electrons are important to fully understand these compounds properties .",
    "however , the theoretical analysis of multiorbital hubbard models is challenging because of the absence of reliable many - body tools to study their properties in layered systems .",
    "in particular , thus far the only theoretical evidence that superconductivity can be induced in these compounds via antiferromagnetic ( afm ) fluctuations relies exclusively on bcs gap equations and random phase approximation techniques .",
    "can we generate more robust theoretical evidence for afm - based superconductivity in these compounds ?    in the context of the copper - oxide high-@xmath2 superconductors , finding crystal structures simpler than layers but still with intriguing quantum mechanical many - body properties proved to be a fruitful path for progress in that field .",
    "one of the reasons is that theorists can perform model hamiltonian calculations with more accuracy in e.g. quasi one - dimensional systems .",
    "in fact , spin-1/2 cu - oxide two - leg ladders have been much studied in cuprates because of their unusual spin gap , induced by the ladder geometry  @xcite .",
    "the cu - oxide - ladder spin state is dominated by rung spin - singlets , and it was theoretically predicted that such a system should have a tendency to superconductivity upon doping .",
    "this was verified in high pressure experiments at @xmath33  gpa for the case of sr@xmath4ca@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 , reporting a critical temperature of 12  k  @xcite . due to its quasi one - dimensional character , it was possible to employ a variety of accurate many - body techniques for ladders , showing agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results , an agreement that has provided considerable support to the notion that superconductivity in cuprates originates in afm fluctuations .",
    "these important earlier results in the context of copper - oxide ladders suggest that progress in the understanding of iron - based superconductors would be possible if similar quasi one - dimensional structures could be prepared and theoretically studied . for this reason",
    "considerable interest was generated by recent studies of bafe@xmath0se@xmath1 because this material contains double chains made of [ fe@xmath0se@xmath1]@xmath9 blocks separated by ba  @xcite .",
    "the resulting structure contains two extended fe - fe directions ( the `` legs '' ) connected by fe - fe bonds of similar strength ( the `` rungs '' ) thus defining two - leg ladders very similar to those in the cuprates .",
    "a difference is that the cu - cu bridge in the cuprates ladders is made by an oxygen in between the coppers , while in chalcogenides the bridges between irons are provided by selenium which is located up and down the middle of the iron plaquettes .",
    "thus , as in their two dimensional counterparts , electronic hoppings of similar strength are to be expected for the chalcogenides not only along legs and rungs , but also along the plaquette diagonals .",
    "bafe@xmath0se@xmath1 is an insulator , with an activation energy between 0.13  ev  @xcite and 0.178  ev  @xcite , long - range afm order at @xmath3250  k induced by weak residual interladder interactions , and low - temperature magnetic moments @xmath32.8  @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , neutron diffraction studies reported a dominant magnetic order at low temperature involving blocks of four iron atoms with their moments aligned , coupled antiferromagnetically along the ladder direction  @xcite .",
    "when k replaces ba , thus leading to kfe@xmath0se@xmath1 , the magnetic state changes to an arrangement where the spins in the same rung are coupled ferromagnetically but they are antiferromagnetically ordered in the long ladder direction  @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies primarily employing the hartree fock approximation  @xcite unveiled a rich phase diagram for two - leg ladder multiorbital hubbard models , with a plethora of phases including both states already found in the ba- and k - based ladders as well as several other competitors .",
    "these exotic spin arrangements arise from frustrating tendencies between the staggered afm state that dominates at small hund coupling and the ferromagnetic ( fm ) state stable at large hund coupling  @xcite .",
    "hartree - fock results for layers  @xcite and chains  @xcite also suggest a complex landscape of competing magnetic states in those geometries .",
    "recently , an unexpected experimental result has been reported using bafe@xmath0s@xmath1  @xcite , where s replaces se but keeps the two - leg ladder structure the same .",
    "this material was found to become superconducting at a pressure above 10 gpa with an optimal critical temperature @xmath11  k. the parent compound , i.e. the same material but at ambient pressure , is a mott insulator with the same magnetic order as kfe@xmath0se@xmath1 namely involving fm rung and afm leg spin correlations with a critical temperature @xmath12  k , according to power neutron diffraction studies  @xcite .",
    "these discoveries unveiled the first iron - based superconductor that does not rely on a square lattice structure of irons , opening an intriguing avenue of research similar to the one opened with the discovery of superconductivity in cu oxide ladders in the context of the cuprates .",
    "the present publication introduces a two - orbital hubbard model for a two - leg ladder of bafe@xmath0s@xmath1 , based on _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "this model is subsequently solved computationally using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) technique  @xcite .",
    "our main results are two folded .",
    "first , we show that at half - filling with two electrons per iron , and using clusters as large as 16@xmath132 , there is a robust evidence for the same magnetic order found experimentally involving fm rungs and afm leg correlations .",
    "this magnetic state becomes robust at intermediate and strong hubbard couplings , in agreement with the growing perception that these materials are not in the weak coupling regime .",
    "second , we assume that in the experiments  @xcite the high pressure alters the band structure in such a manner that the individual ladders become hole doped , although the insulator - superconductor transition could also be bandwidth - controlled  @xcite . in the cu - oxide based ladders studied some years ago , experiments showed  @xcite that indeed pressure alters the amount of mobile electrons residing in the two - leg ladders in such a manner that the superconducting state is reached effectively by hole doping of the ladders .",
    "here we simply assume that a similar physics occurs in the iron - based ladders and focus on their hole doping .",
    "in fact , studying the cases of one , two , and four holes we have found pairing tendencies when using an 8@xmath132 cluster in the strong coupling regime @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the tight binding electronic bandwidth .",
    "the complexity of the hamiltonian with two active orbitals and a tight - binding term that must include plaquette diagonals hoppings renders the dmrg calculation so computing time demanding that a confirmation of the pairing tendency beyond 8@xmath132 is not possible at present with the dmrg technique and our available computer resources .",
    "nevertheless , the pairing indications we have observed are promising and suggestive that the theoretical study of iron - based two - leg ladders may illuminate the understanding of iron - based superconductors using many - body techniques beyond the diagrammatic random phase approximation .",
    "the organization of the manuscript is as follows .",
    "section  ii provides details of the _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "section iii contains the actual model used , many - body technique , and observables studied .",
    "section iv presents our main results , organized separately for zero , one , and two holes , the latter including binding energies .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "v contains our main conclusions .",
    "this section presents the details of the derivation of the multiorbital hubbard model for the bafe@xmath0s@xmath1 ladder from first principles , to be used later in sections iii and iv . following the procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite , first a calculation is performed based on the generalized gradient approximation with the quantum espresso package  @xcite .",
    "there we employed the exchange - correlation functional proposed by perdew , burke and ernzerhof  @xcite , a plane - wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 40 ry , and an 8@xmath138@xmath138 * k*-mesh for the first brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "as for the lattice constants , we used the experimental values @xmath16 = 8.78  , @xmath17 = 11.23  , @xmath18 = 5.29   for the ambient pressure case and reduced them by 4.0% , 8.0% , and 3.4% , respectively , for pressure @xmath19=12.4 gpa  @xcite .",
    "the space group of the system is @xmath20 , and the atomic positions of ba(4c ) , fe(8e ) , s(4c ) , and s(8 g ) are ( 0.0 , 0.686 , 0.25 ) , ( 0.154 , 0.0 , 0.0 ) , ( 0.0 , 0.116 , 0.25 ) , and ( 0.208 , 0.378 , 0.25 ) , respectively  @xcite . because the magnetic properties will be considered when we solve the effective two - orbital hubbard model in the following sections , magnetism was not included in the derivation of the model from first principles  @xcite .",
    "after this initial setup , we constructed two wannier functions for each fe atom in the unit cell using the wannier90 package  @xcite .",
    "one resulting wannier orbital mainly consists of the standard @xmath21 orbital ( orbital @xmath16 below ) while the other one is primarily made from the standard @xmath22 orbital ( orbital @xmath17 below ) .",
    "the two wannier orbitals employed here do not have a high symmetry , because the @xmath21 or @xmath22 orbitals significantly hybridize with other @xmath23-orbitals or s-@xmath24 orbitals .",
    "in particular , for the latter wannier orbital there is a substantial contribution of the canonical @xmath25 orbital . to construct explicitly these orbitals",
    ", we have to disentangle their complicated electronic structure . in order to preserve accurately the properties of the low - energy band dispersion",
    ", we introduced a `` frozen '' energy window  @xcite as large as ( -0.3 ev , 0.2 ev ) with respect to @xmath26 , on top of the ordinary `` global '' energy window ( -1.2 ev , 1.5 ev ) .",
    "after we constructed an 8 band model , we further simplified this model by unfolding the bz along the @xmath27 direction .",
    "namely , by introducing a local gauge transformation for one of the two wannier orbitals to change its sign , we can expand the band dispersion from @xmath28 to @xmath29 in the original bz , and construct a 4 band model  @xcite .",
    "finally , we want to derive an effective ladder model from the 4-band model , namely we wish to arrive to a model restricted to a two - leg ladder .",
    "one possibility is to neglect all inter - ladder electron hopping transfers and just focus on the intra - ladder transfers .",
    "however , the bandwidth in the @xmath30-@xmath31 plane is not necessarily small ( as large as 500 mev at maximum ) .",
    "thus , in the present study the effect of inter - ladder transfers is taken into account by considering their average , i.e. , we construct our ladder model from the 4-band hamiltonian by considering the case @xmath30=@xmath31=0 .",
    "this section explicitly provides the multiorbital hubbard model derived by the procedure explained before , while section iv will present the magnetic properties and pairing tendencies of bafe@xmath0s@xmath1 .",
    "the model studied here breaks up into kinetic energy and interaction terms : @xmath32 .",
    "the tight - binding kinetic energy portion is    @xmath33    where the first term represents the hopping of an electron from site @xmath34 of a two - leg ladder and orbital @xmath35 to site @xmath36 and orbital @xmath37 .",
    "the vector @xmath38 indicates the many different directions possible for the electronic hopping , as shown in the ladder sketch fig .",
    "[ fig1.feslattice ] .",
    "we use a two orbital model where we label the down - folded  @xcite orbitals as @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( i.e. @xmath35 and @xmath37 are restricted to @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) .",
    "@xmath39 represents the crystal - field splitting of orbital @xmath35 .",
    "there are two sets of hopping parameters obtained from fitting the _ ab initio _ down - folded band structure calculations at different pressures .",
    "the crystal fields at @xmath40 gpa are @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( ev units used from now on ) while the associated hopping amplitudes are    @xmath43    while the crystal fields at @xmath44 gpa are @xmath45 and @xmath46 , with associated hoppings amplitudes    @xmath47    figure  2  ( a , b ) show the single particle spectrum , calculated to illustrate the band structure at both @xmath48 and @xmath44 gpa using all the hoppings in eqs .",
    "[ eq2:p0 ] and [ eq3:p12 ] ( `` long range hoppings '' ) . in fig .  3  ( a , b )",
    "similar results are presented but using only hoppings up to nearest neighbor rungs ( `` short range hoppings '' ) .",
    "the band structures in both cases are similar",
    ". however , some discrepancies occur .",
    "for instance at the edges , such as @xmath27=0 and @xmath49 , the short range hoppings present degeneracies ( or near degeneracies ) that are split in the long range case .",
    "it is unclear if these details are significant or not , and without performing the dmrg calculations in both cases explicilty this issue can not be answered conclusively .",
    "here we simply wish to alert the readers of these small differences for completeness .",
    "the electronic interaction portion of the hamiltonian @xmath50 contains the standard intra - orbital hubbard repulsion @xmath51 and the hund s coupling @xmath52 .",
    "the operator @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) is the total spin ( electronic density ) for orbital @xmath35 at site @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) are the pair creation ( annihilation ) operators .",
    "the standard relation @xmath57 is assumed .",
    "the operators are defined in terms of the creation and annihilation fermion operators as @xmath58 @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "the half - filling electronic density corresponds to two electrons per site .",
    "we use the ground state density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) technique with open boundary conditions in order to study the bafe@xmath0s@xmath1 ladder using the two - orbital hubbard model previously defined .",
    "dmrg grows the lattice by adding sites in a `` snake - like '' geometry .",
    "we have studied in detail a ladder size of @xmath61 with up to four holes doped over a half - filled system .",
    "calculations involving @xmath62 and @xmath63 ladders are also presented at half - filling .",
    "keeping up to @xmath64 states , the typical value of the discarded weight ( truncation error ) is of the order of @xmath65 for the doping cases studied . within this level of error observables",
    "are converged .",
    "for the two holes case we can reach a similar accuracy only for 8@xmath132 lattices , and for this reason our study of binding energies is restricted to those lattices . with typical computer resources , @xmath61 ladder simulations with @xmath66 states require 3 - 4 days at half - filling .",
    "the two holes doped case needs more than a week , even if using only short - range hoppings .",
    "the use of the long - range hoppings substantially increases the time required for convergence .",
    "this is because of three different reasons .",
    "first , the most time consuming part of the dmrg process is computing the hamiltonian connections , and with long - range hoppings one has to sum a large number of terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "second , at fixed on - site interactions ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) and fixed density , the difficulty of the dmrg scales exponentially with the number of connections between system and environment , when a lattice is split in the middle .",
    "third , our on - site hilbert space is large due to the presence of two orbitals .",
    "in fact , the system we have studied can be translated into a one - dimensional one - orbital hubbard model with hoppings up to 12@xmath67 neighbors .",
    "this illustrates the substantial numerical effort presented here at the limit of what can be done with modern many - body computational techniques .",
    "we also want to remark that perhaps more modern versions of dmrg , such as those involving matrix product operators , may alleviate the effort needed in the present problem .",
    "in fact , recently @xmath68 ladders including dipolar interactions were studied with up to 400 rungs with this method  @xcite .",
    "we will present a variety of charge and magnetic observables for doping of up to four holes on the half - filled system .",
    "the average occupation number of each orbital is @xmath69 we also calculate the spin - spin correlations by using the fourier transform of the real space @xmath70 , @xmath71 where @xmath72 ( sum over the orbitals ) .",
    "below , this spin structure factor will carry a subindex `` l '' or `` s '' depending on whether in the hamiltonian the long - range or short - range hoppings are used , respectively .    to explore pairing tendencies",
    ", we study the binding energy of a pair of holes defined as @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the ground state energy of the model with a total of @xmath75 electrons ( @xmath76 is half - filling ) .",
    "if the particles minimize their energy by creating a bound state then @xmath77 is negative ; if the holes become two independent particles this corresponds to zero binding energy in the bulk limit . in the case where the particles do not bind , this quantity is positive for finite systems .",
    "to study the effects of holes on the magnetic correlations , we define a projector @xmath78 at site @xmath34 such that it projects out the portion of the ground - state in which site @xmath34 and orbital @xmath35 is occupied  @xcite : @xmath79 in order to work in the hilbert space corresponding to @xmath80 number of holes at specific locations , we apply a product of projectors onto the ground state with @xmath80 holes , @xmath81 , where @xmath34 is the site to be projected while respecting the fermionic normal ordering ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "for example , @xmath83 projects out the occupied part of the ground state on orbital @xmath16 at sites @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "in fact , for most results shown below , we only apply the projector onto orbital @xmath16 in order to observe the corresponding local spin - spin correlations @xmath86 , where the maximum possible magnitude of the correlations is @xmath87 .",
    "this section presents our main results .",
    "we start with the half - filled case that should be contrasted with the experimental data for the two - leg bafe@xmath0s@xmath1 at pressures where magnetic order was reported . _",
    "the magnetic order observed experimentally emerges very clearly from our calculations .",
    "_ we then proceed to the addition of holes , under the assumption that the high pressure used experimentally moves bands around in such a manner that the two - leg ladders become effectively doped .",
    "our main result is that indications of pairing are found in small systems , opening the possibility that indeed superconducting tendencies may be present in the models studied here .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ]  ( a ) shows the electronic population of the two orbitals calculated via dmrg as a function of @xmath88 , for the two electrons per site half filling case . because of the crystal field splitting that locates orbital @xmath17 approximately 0.7  ev below orbital @xmath16 , in the weak coupling regime orbital @xmath17 is considerably more populated . as the energy penalization for double occupancy increases with increasing @xmath88 , eventually at @xmath89",
    "both orbitals become effectively singly occupied .",
    "these orbital populations are robust varying the lattice size and also using either the `` short '' or `` long '' version of the hopping amplitudes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]  ( a ) .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ]  ( b ) presents the spin structure factor at various wavevectors as a function of @xmath88 .",
    "the wavector @xmath90 clearly dominates , particularly in the regime of intermediate and strong coupling .",
    "@xmath91 ( see definition in caption of fig .  4 ) starts growing already at @xmath92 even before the full moments are developed , an intermediate coupling regime that several investigations assign to the iron based superconductors  @xcite . once again , these results are robust increasing the lattice size and using either `` short '' or `` long '' hopping amplitudes .",
    "the small decrease of @xmath91 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]  ( b ) with increasing clusters from 8@xmath132 to 16@xmath132 is reasonable because a true long - range order is not expected in one dimension , but a slow power - law decay should instead prevail .    the dominance of the @xmath90 magnetic order is in excellent agreement with neutron experiments for bafe@xmath0s@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "in our model , this magnetic order dominance arises primarily from the comparable strength of the hopping amplitudes @xmath93 along the diagonal of the elementary plaquettes contrasted with those along the nearest - neighbor sites along the rungs and legs .",
    "this comparable strength originates in the location of sulphur , that acts as a bridge between irons , up and down the middle of the ladder plaquettes .",
    "this is also the same reason for the dominance of the ( degenerate ) @xmath90 and @xmath94 wavevectors in planar geometries , at intermediate and strong couplings .    in two - leg ladders",
    "the explicit breaking of the lattice rotational invariance renders @xmath90 and @xmath94 no longer degenerate . but",
    "why @xmath90 dominates over @xmath94 according to the dmrg calculations ?",
    "a possible simple explanation is the following .",
    "consider a classical @xmath95-@xmath96 spin model for spins of magnitude 1 , where @xmath95 is the antiferromagnetic heisenberg coupling for nearest - neighbors spins both along the rungs and legs , while @xmath96 is the antiferromagnetic coupling along the plaquette diagonals .",
    "the energy of the @xmath90 state is always smaller than the energy of the @xmath94 because in @xmath90 each spin always has two nearest - neighbors afm links , while in @xmath94 there is only one nearest - neighbor afm link . while at small @xmath97 the @xmath98 order dominates as expected , a level crossing to @xmath90 eventually occurs at @xmath99 .",
    "this also provides a possible rationale for why @xmath98 rather than @xmath94 appears to be the subdominant order in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]  ( b ) : in these two - orbital hubbard models for two - leg ladder materials the ratio @xmath97 between the effective heisenberg couplings in strong coupling must be between 0.5 and 1.0 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ]  ( c ) plots the spin squared expectation value as a function of @xmath88 , showing the formation of local moments . the upturn with increasing @xmath88 occurs at values similar to those where @xmath100 starts growing . eventually at strong coupling , @xmath101",
    ", the spins are fully developed and they acquire their maximum value @xmath102 i.e. a magnetic moment 2.0 @xmath10 .",
    "neutron scattering experiments at ambient pressure  @xcite report a moment of 1.2 @xmath10 ( @xmath103 ) , which we find at @xmath104 ; first principles predict a value of 2.0 @xmath10 ( @xmath105 ) at the same pressure  @xcite .",
    "note that neutron scattering may be capturing a moment that is time averaged , thus reducing its value , and other techniques should be used to find the actual instantaneous spin  @xcite .",
    "also note that comparing magnetic moment results of a two orbital model vs. calculations and experiments involving five orbitals is difficult .",
    "regardless , intermediate to strong coupling is the physically relevant regime in this model from the magnetic moment perspective .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows results for the case of one hole doped into the half - filled system .",
    "panel ( a ) displays the population of each orbital .",
    "as at half - filling , the crystal field splitting induces a large difference at weak coupling between the two orbitals .",
    "however , it is curious to observe that in the strong coupling regime the hole is still almost entirely located at orbital @xmath16 , in spite of the presence of a gap induced by the repulsion @xmath51 .",
    "nevertheless , since the @xmath51 is the same for both orbitals , the only asymmetry between the orbitals is the original crystal field splitting that , therefore , must be inducing the asymmetric population with holes of the @xmath16 orbital .",
    "this strong - coupling wannier orbital population , where one orbital is locked at one electron / site and the other at less than one electron / site , corresponds to an orbital selective mott phase ( osmp )  @xcite . in this context orbital @xmath17",
    "provides localized spins @xmath68 , that are in interaction with delocalized carriers at orbital @xmath16 .",
    "the physics of the osmp state suggests that this state , if realized in the present two - leg ladders , may have exotic transport properties that include a very small quasiparticle weight .",
    "panel ( b ) contains the spin structure factor .",
    "as in the case of half - filling , clearly the wavevector @xmath90 dominates starting at @xmath106 , and irrespective of using `` short '' or `` long '' range hoppings .",
    "the dip at @xmath107 is unexpected and it may reflect on how the hole scrambles the original magnetic order as the size of the spin distortion around the hole changes with @xmath88 .",
    "this spin scrambling effect can be better visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] where from the entire wave function of the one - hole state , a projection is made for the case where the hole is located at the sites indicated . while far from the projected hole the spin order is basically unchanged from the half - filled @xmath90 pattern , in the vicinity of the hole there is an inevitable scrambling effect that broadens the @xmath90 peak .",
    "this shift of weight away from @xmath49 along the leg direction is exemplified by the antiferromagnetic coupling `` across the hole '' involving e.g. spins 4 and 8 on the 8@xmath132 lattice that otherwise should be ferromagnetically coupled .",
    "the 12@xmath132 results in the same panel indicate very small size effects .",
    "this across - the - hole afm coupling has been observed in the @xmath108 model context before  @xcite , and it is considered a precursor of spin - charge separation at least at short distances .",
    "in fact , the exact ground state of the @xmath109 one - orbital hubbard model in one dimension presents an exact decoupling between spin and charge with afm couplings across all holes  @xcite .",
    "we warn the readers that there are some qualitative differences between the cases of short and long range hoppings .",
    "of instance in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ]  ( b ) @xmath91 has a `` second peak '' at @xmath110 which is suppressed in @xmath111 .",
    "we do not know the qualitative reasons for this difference .",
    "however , in the important region of pair binding @xmath112 , to be described later in the text , both short and long range hoppings give very similar results .",
    "an interesting observation from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ]  ( b ) is that at very large @xmath88 eventually the one hole state becomes ferromagnetic since @xmath113 dominates . in multiorbital systems , especially in cases where some degrees of freedom are localized and others itinerant as it occurs in this model , double exchange mechanisms can favor ferromagnetic tendencies as it occurs in manganites  @xcite .",
    "in the large @xmath88 regime , the effective heisenberg couplings @xmath95 and @xmath96 are very small since they are inversely proportional to @xmath51 , while the hund coupling being fixed to @xmath114 is very large .",
    "such a regime is clearly favorable for double exchange tendencies , as shown by the dmrg results .",
    "this also indicates that ferromagnetic states are close in parameter space to the realistic regimes for iron superconductors , a conclusion that also emerged from previous investigations  @xcite .",
    "the results for two doped holes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] continue the trends observed before for one hole .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the wannier orbital populations as a function of @xmath88 . as for one hole , at large @xmath88 the orbital @xmath17 population remains locked at one electron / site , while the two holes almost entirely reside at orbital @xmath16 .",
    "this confirms the tendency towards an osmp state with doping . with regards to the spin magnetic order , panel ( b ) , the @xmath90 order still dominates in the broad region between @xmath115 and @xmath116 , but the spin order scrambling caused by the mobile holes reduces the intensity of @xmath100 as expected .",
    "in addition , the tendency towards ferromagnetism triggered by double exchange continues at very large @xmath88 .      after calculating the ground state energies for the @xmath117 , @xmath118 ( 1 hole ) , and @xmath119 ( 2 holes ) subspaces",
    ", we can also calculate the binding energy @xmath77 previously defined .",
    "the remarkable result shown in fig .  [ fig8 ]  ( a ) is that for the 8@xmath132 cluster this quantity becomes negative between @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "this is a broad region , in spite of the perceived narrowness in panel ( a ) because of the logarithmic scale used . in this regime",
    "the spins are already well developed and near saturation as it was shown in fig .",

    "considering that holes are located at orbital @xmath16 , this surprising result brings similarities with negative binding energies found in one - orbital models for the cuprates , such as the @xmath108  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the crude rationale for binding based on the `` number of broken afm links '' may apply here as well  @xcite . in this context , binding occurs because each hole damages the afm spin state , and the manner to minimize the size of that distorted magnetic background is by bringing the holes together .",
    "it is also interesting that exact results obtained via the lanczos method applied to a very small 3@xmath132 lattice produce a profile for the binding energy , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ]  ( b ) , that qualitatively resembles panel ( a ) suggesting that size effects are mild . alas ,",
    "as already explained , we have not been able to reach sufficient accuracy in the two holes sector to confirm the pairing tendencies of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ]  ( a ) with larger lattices , thus our pairing analysis below is restricted to the 8@xmath132 cluster .    the results in panel ( a ) suggesting pairing in a region of parameter space brings analogies with the negative binding energies reported before in kondo lattice models for heavy fermions  @xcite .",
    "for instance in fig .  2  ( b ) of ref .",
    "@xcite a negative @xmath77 is reported using up to 32@xmath132 lattices .",
    "even the pair - pair correlation functions of fig .  3  ( b ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ( unfortunately not within the reach of the present study that uses the full two - orbital hubbard model ) suggest a dominant pairing tendency in the doped kondo lattice on two - leg ladders . perhaps having holes primarily at orbital @xmath16 ( as shown before ) , while orbital @xmath17 remains singly occupied at strong coupling , effectively transforms our model into a kondo lattice model .    to further test the pairing implication of finding a negative binding energy in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , we have also analyzed the real space distribution of holes in the doped system . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ]  ( a ) , the electronic density is shown for orbital @xmath16 , where the holes are mostly located , for each of the 16 sites of the 8@xmath132 lattice at coupling @xmath122 where @xmath77 is negative . for @xmath117 electrons , i.e. half - filled , the electronic density is basically uniform . in the case of @xmath118 electrons , i.e. one hole ,",
    "this hole is located in the middle of the cluster as expected for a system with open boundary conditions .",
    "for the case of two holes corresponding to @xmath119 electrons , these two holes are also located near the center of the cluster but in a tight manner compatible with pairing .",
    "the most important result is for the case of four holes , corresponding to @xmath123 electrons , since fig .",
    "[ fig9 ]  ( a ) indicates the presence of @xmath124 minima in the electronic density , a result compatible with the presence of two hole pairs , as opposed to a single broad minimum which would indicate independent holes or four minima which would signal a charge density wave of holes .",
    "there are also no indications of phase separation . the results in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ]  ( b ) for orbital @xmath17 simply mirror those of orbital @xmath16 but with a far more suppressed hole density .    figure  [ fig10 ]  ( a ) illustrates the internal structure of the hole pairs that we have found using the 8@xmath132 cluster .",
    "this figure is based on the wave function of two holes , with one of the holes projected to site `` 9 '' which is on `` leg-1 '' .",
    "this panel shows that the second hole is primarily located on the other leg , i.e. `` leg-0 '' , mainly at the sites either in the same rung as `` 9 '' or diagonally across the plaquettes .",
    "projecting now the two holes to those particular locations , these two dominant `` plaquette diagonal '' and `` rung '' states for the pair of holes are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig10 ]  ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "similarly as for the case of one hole , there is a notorious `` across the hole '' antiferromagnetic coupling between spins that otherwise should be ferromagnetically coupled in the undoped system .",
    "this afm correlation facilitates the movement of the hole .",
    "note also that if in panel ( b ) the hole located at `` 8 '' and the spin at `` 6 '' are interchanged , as it would happen via the action of electronic hopping and asssuming that the afm and fm bonds remain the same as if they were elastic bands , then panel ( c ) is obtained .",
    "in fact , this panel ( c ) has an afm across - the - hole coupling between `` 4 '' and `` 8 '' and a fm coupling between `` 8 '' and `` 9 '' that was originally a fm coupling along the diagonal from `` 6 '' to `` 9 '' in panel ( b ) . then panels ( b ) and ( c ) are compatible with one another with regards to hole pairing : the two holes are oscillating in different legs close to one another due to an attraction created by the antiferromagnetic background .",
    "in this publication , we have presented the first study of a realistic ( derived from first principles ) electronic model hamiltonian for the two - leg ladder compound bafe@xmath0s@xmath1 that was recently shown to become superconducting at high pressure  @xcite .",
    "the model has two orbitals and electronic hoppings beyond nearest neighbor iron sites , rendering its study difficult even with the powerful dmrg method .",
    "for this reason our analysis has been restricted to relatively small clusters .",
    "nevertheless , we have been able to extract interesting information from the model that is in good agreement with experiments . for example , the parent compound has magnetic order involving ferromagnetic rungs that are coupled antiferromagnetically along the legs , as found in neutron scattering experiments  @xcite . in the strong coupling limit",
    ", this order emerges from the competition between antiferromagnetic heisenberg couplings along rungs and legs and along the diagonals of the plaquettes . with hole doping",
    ", we observed that only one of the two wannier orbitals used here becomes populated .",
    "this indicates a tendency towards effective models involving a combination of itinerant and localized orbitals , as in the context of an orbital selective mott phase . even more exciting",
    ", we have found that at strong coupling and using an 8@xmath132 cluster with two holes , there are indications of hole pair formation induced by antiferromagnetism .",
    "while this result must be confirmed using larger systems and more dmrg states , a challenging task , it suggests that this type of two - orbital models contains the essence of the mechanism for superconductivity in iron - based two - leg ladders , a mechanism that could be similar to that in layered systems . as a consequence",
    ", our present effort paves the way and motivates further studies in this context .",
    "we believe that the theoretical and experimental analysis of iron - based two - leg ladders may prove to be as interesting and illuminating as the early studies in copper oxide two - leg ladders were for cuprate physics , providing a novel playground in the context of iron - based high-@xmath2 superconductivity .",
