    "shortly after its installation onboard the hubble space telescope in 1994 , the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) was observed to suffer from charge - transfer loss , a phenomenon in which charge is removed from a star s image during ccd readout @xcite . the effect of this inefficiency is to reduce the star s apparent brightness , especially those with large y ( parallel - read direction ) values on the ccds ( and , to a lesser extent , those with large x values ) .",
    "an initial solution to this was to cool the camera from @xmath0c to @xmath1c to reduce the magnitude of the effect , and to apply a correction that scaled from linearly from zero for stars with @xmath2 to a maximum of 0.04 magnitudes for stars with @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite also noted that the cte loss appeared to be a function of background level , and recommended no cte correction for images with backgrounds over @xmath4 electrons .",
    "this dependency of cte on background , as well as dependencies on star brightness and observation date , were quantified by @xcite and updated by @xcite , who found that the cte loss in the y direction could be corrected by an equation with the form @xmath5,\\ ] ] where cts is the star s brightness on the read - out image ; bg is the background level ; date is the date of observation ; and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are used to denote functions .",
    "( whitmore et al . used power law functions for both @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and a linear function for @xmath8 . )    in addition to reports from the wfpc2 team , characterizations of cte loss in the refereed literature were made by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter d00 ) .",
    "differences in the assumed functional form of the solution and in the photometry techniques resulted in somewhat different correction prescriptions .",
    "however , d00 found reasonable agreement between the corrected magnitudes being produced by each of the four .",
    "since that time , there have been several significant issues requiring continued examination of the effects of cte loss on wfpc2 stellar photometry .",
    "most notable , given the time dependence of cte loss , is the question of the applicability of published cte corrections to data being currently obtained .",
    "especially given the increased utilization of wfpc2 during cycles 15 and 16 , reinvestigation of cte issues can greatly increase confidence in the photometry being generated .",
    "other concerns are related to the functional form of the cte corrections themselves , due to limited ranges of star brightness and background level of the calibration observations .",
    "@xcite examined the validity of existing cte correction equations on stars significantly fainter than had been previously examined .",
    "while it was encouraging that the d00 corrections were valid when applied to stars as faint as 100 electrons ( thus , the corrections are accurate for the vast majority of data used by wfpc2 science programs ) , for yet fainter stars these corrections appeared to overestimate the cte loss by @xmath9 magnitudes .    likewise , there is the open question of the applicability of existing cte corrections to higher background levels ( specifically , those typical of deep science exposures ) .",
    "early work on wfpc2 cte loss relied primarily on data taken with very low background levels ( mostly less than 10 electrons ) , which required assumptions to be made regarding the effect of background level on cte loss .",
    "however , since 2000 , wfpc2 calibration programs have increasingly made use of the camera s preflash capability , in which the ccds are pre - exposed with a flat - field lamp before the actual observation .",
    "( a preflashed short exposure with bright stars is frequently used to simulate the cte loss seen in much longer observations of fainter stars . )",
    "these data permit a significantly more accurate measurement of the effects of cte loss on higher - background data .",
    "this paper re - evaluates the cte corrections in light of these three concerns , using calibration data obtained through august 2007 .",
    "section 2 describes the data used in this study , section 3 contains preliminary analysis of the functional forms required for accurate cte corrections , section 4 contains the cte corrections themselves , and section 5 examines effects of the new corrections .",
    "as with d00 and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter d02 ) , the data used for this study were observations of the wfpc2 calibration field in .",
    "( to select the data , an hst archive search was made within 1.5 arcmin of @xmath10 and @xmath11 . ) only cold - camera ( @xmath1c ) images were considered .",
    "a total of 1184 data sets were photometered : 142 in f439w , 300 in f555w , 92 in f675w , 573 in f814w , and 77 in the other @xmath12 filters , with the most recent observations taken in august 2007 .",
    "the data were reduced using hstphot @xcite , following the recommended reduction recipe in the hstphot manual except as follows .",
    "first , in the initial sky solution , the `` abbreviated '' mode of was used .",
    "second , was executed with an iterated sky solution during the photometry process ( option 512 ) , cte corrections turned off and photometry calibrated according to @xcite ( option 32 ) , and aperture photometry ( option 1 ) .",
    "the lone option of note is the use of aperture photometry , which increases photometric uncertainties but is more robust ( psf - fitting photometry can induce artificial nonlinearities if the psf is not _",
    "exactly _ correct ) and thus better suited for this analysis .    to avoid complications resulting from the wf4 anomaly @xcite ,",
    "all wf4 observations from sm3b ( march 2002 ) onwards were omitted from this study .    for this analysis ,",
    "the wfpc2 data were compared against ground - based @xmath12 calibration data of @xcite . to facilitate this comparison ,",
    "the @xmath12 magnitudes were transformed to wfpc2 instrumental magnitudes using the color terms of @xcite .    after excluding data that failed to meet data quality requirements ,",
    "55286 stellar measurements were matched to the ground - based standard data .",
    "statistics of the brightness , background , and observation date distributions are presented in table [ tab_stars ] .",
    "prior to attempting a generic solution for cte loss as a function of star brightness , background level , and date of observation ; it is worthwhile to examine each of these variables in isolation . in order to do this ,",
    "the data have been selected to constrain two of these variables to limited ranges , allowing an examination of the third .",
    "for example , to analyze cte loss dependence on date of observation , a limited range of star brightness and background level was chosen .",
    "the data were then divided into groups based on observation date , and each group of data was fit as follows : @xmath13 where the left hand side is the magnitude difference between the wfpc2 and the ground - based standard data .",
    "the fit coefficients @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 give position - independent , xcte , and ycte terms respectively , and are examined in the subsequent sections .",
    "in addition to cte loss , there have also been many concerns regarding photometric errors that are not position - dependent , such as zero point offsets and the long - vs - short anomaly @xcite .",
    "variations in the intercept of the fit from equation [ eq_linfit ] vs. star brightness and vs. background level are shown in figure [ fig_nopos ] .",
    "( note that position - independent errors vs. observation date are merely time variations in the wfpc2 sensitivity , and are tracked extensively by the instrument team and thus not addressed in this study . )    from the figure , one sees that no significant trends in the data are present .",
    "quantitatively , the data permit one to place a @xmath17 upper limit of 0.025 magnitudes per dex of either star brightness or background level over the ranges of each shown in the figure .",
    "it should be noted that this finding not only dispels the presence of a large long - vs - short anomaly , but also provides additional confidence regarding the validity of the comparison between the ground - based standard field and the wfpc2 observations .",
    "specifically , were any error as a function of color present ( which would masquerade as an error as a function of magnitude , given the nature of this field ) , it would have been seen in figure [ fig_nopos ] . as no such error was observed ,",
    "the confidence in the validity of this comparison is enhanced .",
    "what is measured , however , is a mean zero point offset relative to the @xcite calibrations . averaging the three plots of f555w data ,",
    "the mean residual ( wfpc2 minus ground ) is @xmath18 magnitudes , while the mean for the three plots of f814w data is @xmath19 magnitudes .",
    "thus , a correction to the zero points will be needed in order to adequately match the wfpc2 observations to the standard data .      while ycte loss is easy to measure by eye and",
    "has grown significantly over the years , xcte loss has always had a small ( though measurable ) effect on stellar photometry on wfpc2 .",
    "figure [ fig_xcte ] shows xcte loss as a function of star brightness and of background level .    as can be seen from the figure , dependencies of xcte on the independent variables",
    "is not obvious .",
    "( this is also true of variations in xcte as a function of observation date , not shown in figure [ fig_xcte ] . )",
    "thus , determination of xcte dependencies will be left for statistical methods in section 4 .",
    "figure [ fig_ycte_yr0 ] shows ycte loss as a function of date of observation . to provide an indication of how this function is affected by star brightness and background levels , three sets of data",
    "are shown : faint stars on low background ( panel a ) , bright stars on low background ( panel b ) , and bright stars on higher background ( panel c ) . while these samples do not represent the extremes of the data shown in table [ tab_stars ] , these are the largest baselines containing sufficient numbers of stars to see clear trends .",
    "an examination of panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure [ fig_ycte_yr0 ] indicates that , despite nearly a factor of two difference in ycte loss between faint and bright stars in recent observations ( both on low backgrounds ) , both sets of data show similar ycte losses during the earliest observations .",
    "specifically , quadratic fits to the curves give ycte losses of @xmath20 magnitudes for faint stars ( panel a ) and @xmath21 magnitudes for bright stars ( panel b ) for an observation date of 1994.3 ( 20 april 2004 ) .",
    "this indicates that the two curves are not merely scaled versions of each other .",
    "it should also be noted that the same dependence on observation date is seen in both curves , such that panels ( a ) and ( b ) both fall onto the curve : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the year minus 1994.3 .",
    "the data for higher background levels are not nearly as complete , due to few high - background observations of this field made prior to mid-1998 .",
    "the data in figure [ fig_ycte_yr0]c are consistent with both the same intercept at 1994.3 , as well as a lower one . in other words ,",
    "determination of whether the functional form should be @xmath24 or @xmath25 \\times f(\\hbox{bg } ) \\label{eq_bgoutside}\\ ] ] must wait until the analysis of the full data set is made .",
    "it should be noted that the calibration data used by @xcite showed a strong background dependence of ycte loss for observations obtained in 1994 : 0.04 magnitudes of loss ( at @xmath3 ) for measurements with background levels @xmath26 electrons , 0.02 magnitudes for background levels @xmath27 electrons , and zero for higher background levels .",
    "thus , the functional form in equation [ eq_bgoutside ] is to be preferred unless the present data set demonstrate otherwise .",
    "figure [ fig_ycte_cts0 ] shows ycte loss as a function of star brightness , with data selected to show recent observations with low background ( panel a ) , old observations with low background ( panel b ) , and intermediate - age observations with higher background ( panel c ) .",
    "the trend from panels ( a ) and ( b ) is that the slope of the curve decreases as star brightness increases , which suggests the use of an exponential for the cte variation as a function of brightness .",
    "considering only points for which ycte loss is less than 0.5 magnitudes ( see section [ new1 ] for a discussion of the treatment of large cte losses ) and using the results of the previous section , both curves can be fitted with the formula : @xmath28    effects of background on the ycte loss vs. counts will be discussed in section [ cte_bg ] .",
    "the final independent variable considered in this analysis is the background level .",
    "figure [ fig_ycte_bg0 ] shows cte loss as a function of background , for faint stars observed in roughly 2001 ( panel a ) , faint stars observed in 1995 ( panel b ) , and bright stars observed in 2001 ( panel c ) . as with d00 and d02 , a `` softened '' background was used , which equals @xmath29 electrons ( and is 1 if the measured background level is negative ) .",
    "this softened background compresses the lowest background levels , making it easier to find a functional form for fitting cte loss vs. background .",
    "the ycte plots in figure [ fig_ycte_bg0 ] do not show the curvature characteristic of an exponential decay , suggesting that a line be used instead to fit the ycte dependence on background .",
    "another significant feature of the background dependence , although the data used to generate figure [ fig_ycte_bg0 ] contain insufficient stars to make this evident , is that the slope of the relation is shallower for bright stars than it is for faint stars .",
    "thus , the function used to fit the background dependence is @xmath30}.\\ ] ]      when cte loss removes a significant fraction of a star s overall brightness , one must take into account the fact that the cte loss rate itself changes as the star is read out .",
    "using the customary terminology of losses as fractions of star brightness lost ( as opposed to number of electrons lost ) per pixel read out , the cte loss rate will increase during readout since the loss rate increases as the star becomes fainter .",
    "the exact relation can be determined fairly simply .",
    "let the charge lost per pixel transfered be expressed as a differential equation with the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the natural logarithm of the star s brightness ; and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are constants ( or functions of background level and observation date , which are both constant during the readout process ) .",
    "if the star s brightness were to remain essentially unchanged during readout ( i.e. , cte loss is a small fraction of the star s brightness ) , the loss per pixel traversed would be constant as well .",
    "this would result in a magnitude loss @xmath33 of @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the star s y position on the chip .",
    "the multiplier of @xmath36 converts from differences in natural logarithm to differences in magnitude .",
    "note that this general form is seen in the literature correction equations ( whitmore 1998 ; stetson 1998 ; whitmore et al .",
    "1999 ; d00 ) .",
    "however , for very faint stars , the amount of cte loss can be significant , and thus one can not safely assume that cte loss remains constant during readout .",
    "solving equation [ eq_diffeq ] , the magnitude loss is given by @xmath37,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the natural logarithm of the measured counts ( after any loss due to readout ) .",
    "note that , if @xmath38 , this equation simplifies to equation [ eq_simple ] . for larger values of @xmath39 , this produces a smaller cte correction than equation [ eq_simple ] .",
    "it should be noted that a cte correction derived from data including extremely faint stars should implicitly include this effect , as the lower cte loss would have been in the measurements and thus in the correction .",
    "however , most cte corrections ( such as that presented in this paper ) are based only on brighter stars , due to the practical difficulty in obtaining sufficiently accurate photometry of extremely faint stars .",
    "thus , the brightness dependence in the cte corrections is measured using brighter stars for which equations [ eq_simple ] and [ eq_complex ] produce the same result .",
    "assuming that the brightness dependence is correct ( given the extrapolation involved , it may not be ) , the form of the correction from equation [ eq_complex ] will be required to correctly model cte loss of faint stars .",
    "this effect is illustrated in figure [ fig_veryfaint ] . to produce this figure ,",
    "observations of the @xmath40 cen standard field , taken on 17 august 2000 as part of calibration program go-8447 , were analyzed .",
    "the observations consisted of one 100-second f814w exposure and two 14-second f814w exposures ( as well as other exposures using different filters and preflashes ) at each of two pointings . for each pointing",
    ", hstphot was used to obtain photometry for the 100-second exposure as well as the average of the 14-second exposures .",
    "figure [ fig_veryfaint ] shows ratios of the 14-second to 100-second count levels after applying cte corrections of the forms in equations [ eq_simple ] and [ eq_complex ] .",
    "the horizontal line in the figure is at a ratio of 0.14 , which is what would be expected in the absence of cte loss .    as is clear from the figure , the form of the cte correction that accounts for cte loss during readout significantly reduces systematic errors in the correction .",
    "this also bolsters confidence that the cte corrections presented in the next section are valid for stars significantly fainter than those used for to compute the corrections themselves .",
    "guided by the analysis from the previous section , a solution was made for zero points and cte corrections .",
    "several fits were made , with variations on the form of the cte correction .",
    "the form that produced the best fit to the data was @xmath41 and @xmath42 \\times \\hbox{cts}^{-c_8 } \\times \\max { [ ( 1 - c_9 \\ln{\\hbox{bg } } + c_{10 } \\ln{\\hbox{bg } } \\ln{\\hbox{cts } } ) , c_{11 } ] } , \\frac{dm}{dy } & = & \\ { c_4 + c_5 [ ( \\hbox{date}-c_6 ) - c_7 ( \\hbox{date}-c_6)^2 ] \\hbox{cts}^{-c_8 } \\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\max { [ ( 1 - c_9 \\ln{\\hbox{bg } } + c_{10 } \\ln{\\hbox{bg } } \\ln{\\hbox{cts } } + c_{11 } \\ln{\\hbox{cts } } ) , c_{12 } ] } , % \\end{equation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where bg is the background level , cts is the star s brightness , date is the observation date , and the left - hand sides are the magnitude loss per pixel read out in the @xmath32 and @xmath43 directions .",
    "note that this form is not exactly that from equation [ eq_diffeq ] , as the star s brightness appears twice .",
    "however , as long as @xmath44 is sufficiently small that changes to the star s brightness during readout do not significantly affect the bg term , the solution in equation [ eq_complex ] can be used .    after obtaining the best fit to the cte correction parameters ( and zero point differences ) ,",
    "the `` standard '' photometry was redetermined from the corrected wfpc2 data .",
    "the rationale is that 1184 wfpc2 data sets ought to produce photometry that is superior to that of the original calibration data .",
    "in addition , while the results from section 3.1 indicate that issues with the ground - based photometry ( such as errors in color corrections ) do not generate any significant error in the wfpc2 vs. ground comparison , this will eliminate any chance that even a small error in the ground - based data would affect the measured cte corrections .",
    "the only negative aspect to this use of wfpc2-measured standard data to measure wfpc2 cte losses is that the form of the cte solution will implicitly become part of the standard photometry used to derive the cte solution  a sort of circular logic .",
    "however , figure [ fig_cmds ] shows the original and updated cmds , and it is clear that a huge improvement in the standard photometry was obtained by making this improvement without introducing biases .",
    "were one to repeat this process  measure the cte losses from the new standard photometry , determine yet newer standard photometry , redetermine the cte losses , and so on  the standard photometry would change by at most 1% , as shown in panel ( d ) of figure [ fig_cmds ] .",
    "thus , the cte solution recommended here is the one with a single iteration on the standard magnitudes .",
    "naturally , the suggested zero points are based on the original ground - based standards .    to verify that the recommended solution is truly the best fit",
    ", alternative solutions made the following modifications to the functional form :    * adding a brightness dependence to the xcte correction .",
    "this produced a null result ( i.e. , the dependency was zero to within the uncertainties ) .",
    "* using an exponential function of background ( instead of a power law ) in the xcte correction .",
    "this produced a small degradation in the quality of the fit .",
    "due to the small size of the xcte correction , this is of minimal significance . * adopting a background dependence of the form in equation [ eq_bginside ] ( instead of that in equation [ eq_bgoutside ] ) . due to the lack of high - background observations of this field early in wfpc2 s",
    "lifetime , there was no statistical difference between the quality of the fits .",
    "it was therefore decided to adopt the form from equation [ eq_bgoutside ] , whose solution for early observations is in strong agreement with the cte characterization of @xcite .",
    "* moving the count dependence also outside the brackets in equation [ eq_bgoutside ] .",
    "this was is the most common form in literature cte corrections , including d00 and d02 .",
    "this produced a significantly worse fit , and can be ruled out .",
    "* using a power law for the ycte background dependence .",
    "this was also used in most literature corrections , including d00 and d02 .",
    "this also produced a significantly worse fit , and can be ruled out .",
    "the recipe for correcting cte loss is as follows .",
    "given a star brightness cts , background level bg ( both in electrons ) , observation date date ( in mjd ) , and star position on the image @xmath45 and @xmath35 , the following sequence of calculations will provide the @xmath46 and @xmath47 losses , both in magnitudes .",
    "@xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 ycte = 2.41 \\ln[(1+c)e^{0.02239 \\max{(1.0 - 0.201 \\mbox{lbg}+0.039 \\mbox{lbg } \\mbox{lct}+0.002 \\mbox{lct},0.15 ) } ( y/800)}-c]\\ ] ] note that the offsets of 1 for lbg and 7 for lct were put in place for numerical stability , and do not affect the solution itself .",
    "the zero points of the four primary filters ( f439w , f555w , f675w , and f814w ) were measured independently for each chip and gain setting ( thus , a total of eight zero points per filter ) . for other filters ,",
    "the relatively small number of available data sets required that their zero points be characterized with a single offset relative to the zero point of the nearest primary filter .",
    "zero points for both gain settings are provided in tables [ tab_zp7 ] and [ tab_zp14 ] .",
    "instrumental magnitudes can be computed using @xmath54 where the counts / second rate is measured within an aperture whose diameter is one arcsecond .",
    "the @xmath12 transformations of @xcite have also been modified to account for the new zero points , and are provided in table [ tab_xform ] .",
    "( note that the color terms have been adopted without modifications , and are reprinted here for convenience . )",
    "standard @xmath12 magnitudes can be computed with the following equation : @xmath55 for instances in which a single set of parameters does not describe the relation sufficiently well for all colors , the cmin and cmax columns of table [ tab_xform ] show the color range for which the table row is valid . again , the count rate is measured within an aperture whose diameter is one arcsecond .      to verify",
    "the accuracy to which the data are being corrected , figures [ fig_cts_last ] , [ fig_bg_last ] , and [ fig_yr_last ] show the ycte residuals after zero point and cte corrections have been applied .",
    "these plots are generated similarly to figures [ fig_ycte_yr0]@xmath56[fig_ycte_bg0 ] , although larger data selections have been used .    with the possible exceptions of the background dependence for early observations ( figure [ fig_bg_last]d ) ,",
    "no significant trends remain in the data .",
    "it should also be noted that the upward trend in figure [ fig_bg_last]d is based on very little data ; only 544 star measurements ( of the 22603 used for the data in this panel ) had background levels of 20 or more electrons .",
    "comparing the cte corrections from this work with those of d02 , the cte corrections agree to within 0.02 magnitudes for over 80% of the star measurements .",
    "stars for which the current corrections are more than 0.02 magnitudes larger fall primarily into two categories : bright stars on a bright background , and dim stars ( brightnesses of a few hundred electrons ) on backgrounds of a few electrons . not surprisingly , stars for which the current corrections are more than 0.02 magnitudes smaller also fall into two categories : bright stars on a low background ( one electron or less ) , and dim stars on bright backgrounds .",
    "the reason for the difference is the term allowing the background correction slope to change as a function of star brightness , which was not present in the d02 cte equation . to verify that the new corrections indeed fit the data better , figure [ fig_ctecomp ] shows the residuals for both sets of cte corrections , plotted versus the difference between the cte corrections .",
    "the relation between cte difference and residual is clear in figure [ fig_ctecomp]a , and in fact has a slope of one . using the corrections from this paper , no trend of residual as a function of cte difference exists ( figure [ fig_ctecomp]b ) .",
    "given that typical science exposures have background levels higher than is typical in calibration exposures , this result can have a significant on the analysis of wfpc2 data .",
    "the study presented here revisits the topic of wfpc2 charge transfer inefficiency , building on results of previous work ( d00 , d02 ) .",
    "this examination is overdue , as the existing cte characterizations are several years old and thus application to current wfpc2 observations requires significant extrapolation of the calibration data to the current epoch .",
    "in addition to incorporation of more recent calibration data , several other enhancements were made over the previous work .",
    "most significantly , it was seen that the effects of star brightness and background level can not be treated independently . making this assumption gave reasonable cte corrections for stars whose brightness or background level was typical of calibration data . however , for higher background levels , the older cte corrections will undercorrect bright stars and overcorrect faint stars . for bright stars ,",
    "the resulting systematic error can significantly exceed the random error from photon noise .",
    "other significant changes from the earlier work include accounting for the change in cte loss during readout , an improved functional form for the background dependence , and a count dependence that begins at zero at the beginning of the wfpc2 mission .",

    "<S> charge - transfer loss on the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) onboard the hubble space telescope is a primary source of uncertainty in stellar photometry obtained with this camera . </S>",
    "<S> this effect , discovered shortly after the camera was installed , has grown over time and can dim stars by several tenths of a magnitude ( or even more , in particularly bad cases ) . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of cte loss on wfpc2 stellar photometry was characterized by several studies between 1998 and 2000 , but has received diminished attention since acs became hst s primary imager . after the failure of acs in january 2007 , wfpc2 once again became the primary imaging instrument onboard hst , restoring the importance of ensuring accurate cte corrections .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper re - examines the cte loss of wfpc2 , with three significant changes over previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> first , the present study considers calibration data obtained through 2007 , thus increasing the confidence in the reliability of the cte corrections when applied to recent observations . </S>",
    "<S> second , the change in cte loss during readout is accounted for analytically . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a reanalysis of the cte dependencies on counts , background , and observation date was made . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting correction is significantly more accurate than that provided in the wfpc2 instrument handbook ( dolphin 2002 and updates through 2004 ) , resulting in photometry that can be enhanced by over 5% in certain circumstances . </S>"
