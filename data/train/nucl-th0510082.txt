    "knowledge of the @xmath0-nucleus interaction potential is a key for the analysis of various reactions between @xmath0-particle and nuclei . by using the potential between @xmath0-particle and nuclei we can evaluate the cross sections for various reactions .",
    "the @xmath0-decay process involves sub - barrier penetration of @xmath0-particles through the barrier , caused by interaction between @xmath0-particle and nucleus .",
    "therefore , @xmath0-decay half - lives depend strongly on the @xmath0-nucleus interaction potential too .    the fusion reaction between @xmath0-particle and nucleus proceeds in the opposite direction of the @xmath0-decay reaction . however , the same @xmath0-nucleus interaction potential is the principal factor to describe both reactions .",
    "therefore it is natural to use data for both the @xmath0-decay half - lives and the sub - barrier fusion reactions for determination of the @xmath0-nucleus interaction potential .",
    "note that a combination of these data has not yet been used for evaluation of @xmath0-nucleus potential .",
    "the nucleus - nucleus interaction potential consists of both coulomb repulsion and nuclear attraction parts .",
    "these two parts form a barrier at small distances between @xmath0-particle and nuclei .",
    "the coulomb component of the potential is well - known .",
    "in contrast , the nuclear part of the potential is less well - defined .",
    "there are many different approaches to the nuclear part of the interaction potential between @xmath0-particle and nuclei @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-decay @xcite and various scattering @xcite data are used for evaluation of the @xmath0-nucleus potential . however , there are no global potentials between @xmath0-particle and nuclei that fit with good accuracy various reaction data from many nuclei at collision energies deeply below and around the barrier ( e.g. , the iaea reference input parameter library @xcite )",
    ". potentials @xcite evaluated for the same colliding system using different approaches differ considerably .",
    "thus , there is a need to reduce the uncertainty of the interaction potential around the point where the @xmath0-particle and nucleus touch at low collision energies .",
    "the fusion reaction between the @xmath0-particle and nucleus at collision energies around the barrier is very sensitive to the behavior of the potential around the barrier .",
    "the energy released in @xmath0-decay transition from the ground - state to the ground - state is the @xmath4-value .",
    "the @xmath4-value of @xmath0-decay is smaller than the energies used in sub - barrier fusion reactions .",
    "therefore , the ground - state to ground - state @xmath0-decay of nuclei is sensitive to the values of potential over a very wide range of distances , from close to touching to very large .",
    "the distance between the @xmath0-particle and nucleus is reduced during the fusion process , while the distance increases in the case of @xmath0-decay of a nucleus .",
    "thus , these reactions are the inverse of each other , and we should describe both reactions using the same potential",
    ". therefore data sets for both fusion and @xmath0-decay together present a unique opportunity for accurate determination of the @xmath0-nucleus potential at the energy range from close to zero to around the barrier .",
    "the knowledge of the @xmath0-nucleus potential over this energy range is also very important for various other applications .",
    "for example , the evaluation of the @xmath0-particle capture rate is very important for description of reactions in the stars @xcite .",
    "the low - energy fusion reactions and @xmath0-decays are only related to the real part of the potential . however , cross - sections of various reactions at collision energies higher than the barrier depend on the both real and imaginary parts of the @xmath0-nucleus potential @xcite .",
    "so , the fusion and @xmath0-decay reactions present a unique opportunity to reduce the number of fitting parameters using in the determination of the real part of the @xmath0-nucleus potential .",
    "the experimental information on @xmath0-decay half - lives is extensive and is being continually updated ( see refs . @xcite and papers cited therein ) .",
    "the theory of @xmath0-decay was formulated by gamow a long time ago @xcite .",
    "subsequently various microscopic @xcite , macroscopic cluster @xcite and fission @xcite approaches to the description of @xmath0-decay have been proposed .",
    "the simple empirical relations described the @xmath0-decay half - lives @xcite are discussed also .",
    "below we will use a cluster approach to the @xmath0-decay , which is the most suitable for determination of the interaction potential between @xmath0-particle and nucleus . using this potential",
    "we simultaneously describe the available data for both the alpha - decay half - lives and the sub - barrier fusion reaction cross - sections .",
    "many @xmath0-emitters are deformed .",
    "therefore @xmath0-nucleus potential should depend on the angle @xmath5 between the direction of @xmath0-emission and the axial - symmetry axis of the deformed nucleus .",
    "both the @xmath0-decay width and the transmission coefficient for tunnelling through the barrier are strongly dependent on @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this effect is considered in detail in microscopic models @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , deformation and angle effects have not been considered in previously discussed cluster models of @xmath0-decay half - lives @xcite .",
    "below , we take into account the deformation of a daughter nucleus during @xmath0-decay within the framework of our simple cluster model .",
    "the fusion reactions between nuclei around the barrier are strongly influenced by the coupling to both low - energy surface vibration states and nucleon transfers @xcite .",
    "these two mechanisms of sub - barrier fusion enhancement are considered in detail in the construction of various models @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the amplitude of this enhancement of sub - barrier fusion cross - section varies depending on the model and various parameters .",
    "moreover , some of these parameters are often used for data fitting .",
    "however , such coupling effects are small in the cases of stiff magic or near - magic nuclei .",
    "the neutron transfer enhancement of sub - barrier fusion cross section can be neglected when neutron transfer channels with positive @xmath4-value are absent @xcite .",
    "we chose the fusion reactions @xmath0+@xmath1ca , @xmath0+@xmath2co and @xmath0+@xmath3pb for evaluation of the @xmath0-nucleus potential , because the magic or near - magic nuclei @xmath6he , @xmath1ca , @xmath2co and @xmath3pb are very stiff and all 1- and 2-nucleon transfer channels have negative @xmath4-values for these reactions .",
    "thus , in these reactions the values of sub - barrier fusion cross - section evaluated by different models are very close to each other , and we can make model - independent analysis of these reactions without any fitting of additional parameters . fortunately , there are experimental data for fusion reactions @xmath0+@xmath1ca , @xmath0+@xmath2co and @xmath0+@xmath3pb @xcite .    our cluster model for evaluation of @xmath0-decay half - lives and sub - barrier fusion reaction is presented in sec .",

    "the @xmath0-particle can be emitted from any point of the nuclear surface and to any direction .",
    "it is obvious , however , that the @xmath0-particle emission in a direction normal to the nuclear surface is the most profitable in terms of energy .",
    "thus the total width is evaluated by averaging partial widths ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the total @xmath0-decay width is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the partial width of @xmath0-emission in direction @xmath5 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the space angle .",

    "the majority of the ground - state @xmath0-emitters are spherical nuclei or axial - symmetric nuclei with moderate quadrupole deformation .",

    "it can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath5 is the angle between the symmetry axis of axially - symmetric deformed nuclei and the vector from the center of the deformed nucleus to the emission point on the nuclear surface . due to the small or moderate values of the quadrupole deformation of nuclei we neglect the difference between the surface normal direction and @xmath5 .",

    "the inner turning point @xmath22 is close to the touching point @xmath43 , and therefore presentation of coulomb field in the form ( 8) at distances @xmath44 ensures the continuity of the coulomb field and its derivative at @xmath45 .",

    "an @xmath0-particle emitted during the ground - state to the ground - state transition has , as a rule , zero value of the orbital momentum @xmath47 and negligible tangential velocity .",
    "thus , we disregard the small effects of variation of the angle @xmath5 during the barrier penetration in the case of @xmath0-emission from deformed nuclei . therefore the action ( 5 ) related to the sub - barrier penetrability depends only on @xmath46 .",
