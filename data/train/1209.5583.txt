    "the study of neutron - rich nuclei with unusually large @xmath5 ratios is challenging the conventional view of nuclear structure  @xcite .",
    "it is established that , when going from the @xmath6-stability line to drip line , the shell structure evolves and new magic numbers may emerge due to the dynamic effects of the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the influence of the proton - neutron interaction and its higher order term ( namely the tensor force ) has been extensively analyzed in recent publications  @xcite .",
    "one may expect that other components of the nucleon - nucleon interaction contribute also to the shell evolution .",
    "however , this issue has not been much covered , which may be related to the fact that the isoscalar channel of the effective interaction is usually much stronger than the isovector part . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that a modification for the isovector @xmath7 channel of the monopole interaction is needed to reproduce the energies and electromagnetic transition properties of low - lying states in nuclei around @xmath8c .    in this paper",

    "in particular , we will show that the neutron - neutron monopole interaction can have significant effect on the evolution of @xmath1 shell in carbon isotopes .",
    "the rapid decrease of the @xmath9 in @xmath1 isotones indicates that the @xmath1 shell gap existing in oxygen isotopes erodes in nitrogen and carbon isotopes  @xcite . at @xmath1 , the @xmath4 value measured through the lifetime of the @xmath10 state in @xmath0c",
    "@xcite is much larger than the values in @xmath11c  @xcite and @xmath12o  @xcite while an inelastic scattering measurement presents a much smaller @xmath4 value in @xmath0c  @xcite . in this paper",

    "we present a detailed investigation on @xmath1 shell evolution to point out that the role played by the proton - neutron interaction in shell evolution can be `` enhanced '' by the attractive neutron - neutron interaction due to the many - body correlations .",

    "it is interesting to investigate the contribution of @xmath62 and @xmath63 in other cases of shell evolution in order to gain a complete understanding of how nuclear force drives the shell evolution .",

    "<S> full shell - model diagonalization has been performed to study the structure of neutron - rich nuclei around @xmath0c . </S>",

    "<S> the origin of this unexpectedly large effect , which is comparable with ( sometimes even larger than ) that caused by the proton - neutron interaction , is related to the enhanced configuration mixing in those nuclei due to many - body correlations . </S>",
