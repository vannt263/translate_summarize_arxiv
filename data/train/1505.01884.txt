    "the most important property of lasers not captured by semiclassical theories , which treat the fields via maxwell s equations , is the intrinsic laser linewidth due to quantum fluctuations . above the laser threshold",
    "these fluctuations cause a diffusion in the phase of the emitted laser signal , leading to a broadening of the observed line , which would have zero width within semiclassical theory .",
    "the magnitude of this linewidth depends upon the geometry of the laser cavity as well as upon the output power of the laser , and was first calculated by schawlow and townes @xcite , and the standard formula arising from their work , the `` schawlow - townes '' ( st ) linewidth , is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the central frequency of the emitted laser light , @xmath3 is the decay rate of the passive cavity resonance corresponding to the laser mode , and @xmath4 is the output power .",
    "( schwalow and townes actually found twice this value in their original work , which assumed the laser was near threshold , but it was quickly recognized that far above threshold only the phase fluctuations were important , reducing the linewidth by a factor of two ) . in subsequent decades , improved theoretical analyses allowed for the discovery of four significant corrections to this formula .",
    "the @xmath0 factor arises from the coupling between intensity and phase fluctuations , and takes different forms depending on the nature of the gain medium . for atomic media",
    "it was first recognized by lax @xcite and tends to be relatively small ; for semiconductor media its importance was realized by henry @xcite , and in this context it typically dominates the direct phase fluctuation terms found by schawlow and townes , and is called the henry @xmath0 factor .",
    "a second correction arises from relaxing the assumption of complete inversion of the gain medium used by schawlow - townes ; this incomplete inversion factor accounts for the actual number of inverted gain atoms @xcite .",
    "a third and particularly interesting correction is the petermann factor , which describes the effect of the openness of the cavity and the consequent non - orthogonality of the lasing modes @xcite .",
    "each of these corrections _ increases _ the linewidth from the st value , which it is natural to regard as a lower bound .",
    "however , there exists a fourth correction , often referred to as the `` bad - cavity '' factor , which leads to a _ reduction _ in the laser linewidth .",
    "this correction is only appreciable when the cavity decay rate , @xmath5 is fast enough ( q is low enough ) that @xmath6 , where the latter is the dephasing rate of the polarization of the gain medium , which determines the gain bandwidth @xcite .",
    "hence it is appreciable when gain dispersion is significant .",
    "this correction was first interpreted as a slowing of phase diffusion due to atomic memory effects @xcite , and subsequently an alternative interpretation was pointed out : the dispersion reduces the group velocity of the light within the cavity , leading to an increase in the effective cavity q and a narrowing of the st linewidth due to the active medium @xcite .",
    "more recently , superradiant gain media have been proposed as a way of using the bad - cavity factor to achieve ultralow linewidth lasers @xcite .",
    "however none of the previous linewidth theories have treated fully the space - dependence of the electric fields and the non - linear spatial hole - burning effect in lasers , which greatly affects the stimulated and spontaneous emission rates at different points in the cavity .",
    "recently , a steady - state _ ab initio _ laser theory ( salt ) @xcite has been developed which treats the spatial degrees of freedom essentially exactly , even in the case of multimode lasing .",
    "for single - mode lasing the validity of the theory only requires that @xmath7,where @xmath8 is the non - radiative relaxation rate of the lasing transition ; for multimode lasing the condition @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the free spectral range of the resonator , is also required @xcite .",
    "subsequently ab initio linewidth theories , based on fluctuations in the fields around the salt solutions , have led to generalized linewidth formulas which should be more accurate than the original st linewidth formula with the four previous corrections included as independent multiplicative factors , as is typically done .",
    "the first works of this type used a scattering matrix formulation of the quantum fluctuations and input - output theory @xcite , which captured correctly the generalization of the petermann and bad - cavity factors , but not that of the alpha and incomplete inversion factors .",
    "the linewidth is expressed in terms of the residue of the lasing pole in the scattering matrix and leads to analytic formulas in terms of the salt solutions .",
    "very recently pick _",
    "@xcite have derived a more general analytic formula for the linewidth , by applying a coupled mode noise analysis to the salt solutions .",
    "this formula agrees with the results of @xcite but goes beyond them to include correctly more general @xmath0 and incomplete inversions factors .",
    "we will refer to this generalized theory , which includes noise effects , as n - salt ( salt plus noise ) .",
    "we believe that the n - salt linewidth formula quantitatively predicts the laser linewidth ( far above threshold ) including all corrections in an appropriately generalized form , and in that sense represents completely the effects of spontaneous emission on the laser linewidth .",
    "we test this hypothesis in the current work by direct integration of the laser equations with noise .",
    "adding langevin noise to the steady - state lasing solutions for a gain medium of two - level atoms was shown in @xcite to lead to a set of non - linear coupled mode equations for the time - dependent fluctuations around the salt steady - state .",
    "evaluation of the noise - averaged field correlation functions from these equations gives the n - salt laser linewidth in the form : @xmath11 |\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_0(\\mathbf{x})|^2 d\\mathbf{x } \\int { \\textrm{im}}[\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{x},\\omega_0)]\\frac{n_2(\\mathbf{x})}{d(\\mathbf{x})}|\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_0(\\mathbf{x})|^2 d\\mathbf{x } } { \\left|\\int \\boldsymbol{\\psi}_0 ^ 2(\\mathbf{x } ) \\left(\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{x},\\omega_0 ) + \\frac{\\omega_0}{2 } \\frac{d\\varepsilon}{d\\omega}|_{\\omega_0 } \\right ) d\\mathbf{x } \\right|^2 } ( 1 + \\tilde{\\alpha}^2 ) , \\label{eq : noisefdtdcmt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the the semiclassical lasing field inside of the cavity found from salt , normalized such that @xmath13 , and the integral is over the cavity region .",

    "there are two different ways of incorporating the effects of spontaneous emission on the electric field inside of the laser cavity , either by using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem alongside the wave equation , or by including spontaneous emission in the atomic degrees of freedom , which are coupled non - linearly to the wave equation . in this section",

    "while the data is too noisy , and the difference between the single mode and two - mode predictions too small , for the resolution of their differences , we do observe increased linewidth and variance in our simulations close to the threshold of the second lasing mode , as expected .",

    "the offset observed between the two linewidths is due to the slightly different locations of the second mode threshold and if this difference is subtracted , as is seen in the inset of fig .",

    "[ fig:2mode_inten ] . quantitative agreement between the fdtd and n - salt linewidth predictions is seen in both versions of the plot , but the inset demonstrates that most of the discrepancy seen in the outer plot is due to differences in the output power of the cavity due to the salt simulations being further above threshold than the fdtd simulations for the same value of the pump @xmath163 .

    "in this work we have performed a first principles test of the n - salt linewidth results derived by pick _",

    "@xcite . to do this",
    ", we used the fdtd algorithm to simulate the maxwell - bloch equations coupled to a set of langevin noise equations , thus including the effects of spontaneous emission .",
    "we found excellent quantitative agreement between the n - salt linewidth predictions and the fdtd simulations , while finding substantial deviations from the ` fully corrected ' schawlow - townes theory , demonstrating that the intertwining of the cavity decay rate , petermann factor , incomplete inversion factor , bad - cavity correction and henry @xmath0 factor in the n - salt linewidth formula is necessary and correct .",
    "this comparison was first done in a parameter range in which the relaxation oscillations were weak ( near the class a boundary ) . through comparison with the chong and stone linewidth theory @xcite",
    ", we demonstrated that for the small , @xmath245 , cavities studied here , much but not all of the improved agreement found by n - salt is due to the proper treatment of the incomplete inversion factor .",
    "next , we successfully demonstrated that n - salt gives the correct output intensity spectrum including relaxation oscillations for class b lasers , and correctly reproduces the side - peaks due to relaxation oscillations .",
    "this set of simulations also verified that the side - peaks shift away from the center of the spectrum as the pump on the gain medium is increased .",
    "we then studied the different predictions for the linewidth enhancement due to the coupling between intensity and phase fluctuations , the @xmath0 factor , and demonstrated that the n - salt form of the @xmath0 factor yields quantitative agreement with the fdtd simulations , while previous forms of the @xmath0 factor are shown to disagree .",
    "this set of simulations is particularly remarkable , because in the absence of the n - salt prediction for @xmath219 , one might conclude that the fdtd simulations do not correctly capture the effects of the @xmath0 factor . instead , it is clear that the fdtd algorithm used does contain all of the relevant physics , and that there can be a significant difference between the various forms of the @xmath0 factor .",
    "finally , we demonstrated that the n - salt theory correctly predicts the linewidth for multiple active lasing modes .",
