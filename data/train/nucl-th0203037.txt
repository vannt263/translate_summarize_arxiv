    "mean - field calculations have been extremely successfull over the last 3 decades to describe the structure of stable as well as radioactive nuclei and this over a very wide range of nuclear masses .",
    "especially effective nucleon - nucleon interactions of the type of skyrme @xcite and gogny forces @xcite have been particularly efficient in this context .",
    "such phenomenological effective interactions can be understood as mathematically simple parametrisations of a density - dependent effective g - matrix ( see @xcite and @xcite for a review on such effective forces ) .    together with the exact treatment of the mean - field problem in the hartree - fock ( hf ) approach ,",
    "semiclassical approximations thereof have proven very appropriate .",
    "especially the approach known as the extended thomas - fermi ( etf ) method has been shown @xcite to describe very accurately average nuclear properties in the sense of the bethe - weizscker mass formula @xcite . in their selfconsistent version",
    "the etf calculations determine the structure of a given nucleus by minimizing the total energy with respect to a variation of the neutron and proton densities .",
    "such calculations require , however , only * integrated * quantities as e.g. the total nuclear energy .",
    "the aim of the present paper is , on the contrary , to investigate * local * quantities such as nuclear mean - field potentials , effective mass and spin - orbit form factors which are at the basis of the description of the nuclear structure and which can be obtained as function of the selfconsistent semiclassical densities .",
    "the convergence of these local ( non integrated ) semiclassical quantities and their comparison to the corresponding hf distributions has , to our knowledge , never been extensively investigated as this will be done here .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . after specifying in section 2 the etf expressions up to order @xmath5 for @xmath6",
    "$ ] and @xmath7 $ ] using the general but rather cumbersome form of these expressions given in @xcite , we show in section 3 that the semiclassical expansions which define these quantities converge rapidly for reasonable forms of the nuclear density @xmath8 .",
    "once these expressions and their convergence established , we compare in section 4 the average mean fields obtained using these semiclassical densities to the central potentials resulting from a hf calculation .",
    "we finally conclude giving an outlook on how these calculations can be generalized to excited and rotating nuclei .",
    "for effective nucleon - nucleon interactions of the skyrme type the total energy of a nucleus is a functional of the local densities @xmath9 , the kinetic energy densities @xmath10 and the so called spin - orbit densities @xmath11 @xcite @xmath12 where the subscript @xmath13 denotes the nucleon charge state . in the case of broken time - reversal symmetry",
    "the energy density depends , in addition , on other local quantities @xcite , such as the current density @xmath14 and the spin - vector density @xmath15 . in what follows",
    "we will restrict ourselves to time - reversal symmetric systems leaving the case of broken time - reversal symmetry , particularly encountered in the case of rotating nuclei , to a subsequent publication .",

    "this functional is , however , perfectly unknown .",
    "the great advantage of the semiclassical approach used here , consists in the fact that , in connection with effective interactions of the skyrme type such an energy functional @xmath17 can be derived explicitly .",
    "in addition , it is to be noted that the semiclassical functionals obtained in the etf formalism such as @xmath6 $ ] are completely general and valid for any local interaction and any nucleus , and can therefore be determined once and forever .",
    "once the functional of the total energy is known , one is able , due to the hohenberg - kohn theorem , to perform density variational calculations , where the local densities @xmath9 are the variational quantities .",
    "one should , however , keep in mind that , as the etf functionals are of semiclassical nature , the density functions @xmath9 obtained as a result of the variational procedure can only be semiclassical in nature , i.e. of the liquid - drop type .",
    "taking into account that in such a process the particle numbers @xmath18 and @xmath19 should be conserved , one can formulate the variational principle in the form @xmath20 - \\lambda_n \\rho_n(\\vec{r } )                                        - \\lambda_p \\rho_p(\\vec{r } ) \\right\\ } d^3r   \\label{c2.3}\\ ] ] with the lagrange multipliers @xmath21 and @xmath22 to ensure the conservation of neutron and proton number .",

    "this causes not only a change in the analytical form of quantities such as the average potentials @xmath123 which are now going to depend on these additional densities but also leads to the appearance of additional terms in the functionals @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath110 $ ] .",
    "these functionals have already been determined in @xcite which makes it quite straightforward to calculate selfconsistent semiclassical fields such as @xmath123 for rotating nuclei very similarly to what we have done here in the static case and investigate the dependence of these quantities with increasing angular momentum .",
