    "in particular in this letter we study a very interesting effect due to presence of two axes of expansion in an ellipsoidal universe .",
    "let us begin by briefly discussing the quantization of electromagnetic field in a bianchi type i space - time .",
    "the spatially homogeneous and anisotropic bianchi type i model is descripted by the line element @xmath2-b^2(t)dz^2\\ ] ] where scale factor @xmath3 and @xmath4 are functions of cosmic time @xmath5 only , @xmath6 is the direction of anisotropy and @xmath7-@xmath8 plane contains a planar symmetry . in such a way , we are able to derive the equations for electrodynamic , starting from maxwell equations in a curved space - time so that , requiring the generalized gauge @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the quadripotential for the electromagnetic field . we consider the simple case in which @xmath11 , the equations become : @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 . + at this step , let s define the normal modes @xmath20 in the following way : @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the components of the polarization vectors and @xmath23 are the usual creator and destruction operators which must satisfy the standard commutation rules : @xmath24=\\delta_{\\vec{k}\\vec{k'}}\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}\\\\ & \\left [ a_{\\rvert \\vec{k}\\alpha},a_{\\rvert \\vec{k'}\\beta}^+\\right]=\\delta_{\\vec{k}\\vec{k'}}\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}\\\\ & \\text{all others}=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 means @xmath26 and @xmath27 means @xmath28 . it s important to stress the difference by the standard expansion : in this case , it s not possible to define the same modes for all @xmath29 , due to the fact that the equations depend on the particular value of @xmath29",
    "; in fact we obtain : @xmath30 that describe the evolution of normal modes coupled to the expanding space - time by @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in flat frw case , it is important to note that @xmath33 , i.e. eq .   and eq .   became the same equation and so modes evolve at the same manner in all directions .",
    "in the statical case @xmath34 , so eq .",
    "and eq .   admit the well know solution @xmath35 with @xmath36 .    in this letter",
    "we will focus on a special case .",
    "equations and manifest the presence of several evolving modes : in particular , we can study the high - frequency modes and the low - frequency ones . to this end , let s consider the general equation : @xmath37 where @xmath38 or @xmath39 respectively for transverse and longitudinal modes . at this stage ,",
    "let s rewrite the eq .   by introducing @xmath40 as follow",
    ": @xmath41 this is an useful trick that allows us to separate the growth in amplitude from the wave - like evolution of the modes ; in fact we obtain the following equation : @xmath42 \\dot f_k+\\left[k^2-\\omega_k^2\\pm i\\,\\omega_k\\,g\\right]f_k=0.\\ ] ] the behavior of the modes depends on the comparison by @xmath43 and @xmath44 : in fact , during @xmath45 , eq .   admits as solution : @xmath46 that corresponds to the constant amplitude free - wave modes , with @xmath47 .",
    "this limit occurs when @xmath48 and @xmath49 , so that we have the very interesting phenomena that the frequency of the oscillation is much higher than the rates of expansion .",
    "this means that the modes are able to complete a very large number of oscillations before noticing the change of the space - time that stretches its amplitude .",
    "otherwise , when @xmath50 , eq .   appears as follows : @xmath51f_k=0.\\ ] ] this equation is highly non trivial to solve , but we find an heuristic way to understand the behavior of the solutions .",
    "let s suppose that @xmath52 : in this case eq",
    ".   becomes : @xmath53f_k=0 \\ , , \\ ] ] that admits the following solution , assuming @xmath54 : @xmath55 e^{\\pm 2\\,i\\,\\omega_k\\,t}+c_2\\exp\\frac{-k^2}{q}t\\right ] e^{\\mp i\\,\\omega_k\\,t}\\rightarrow\\\\ \\rightarrow a_k\\approx c_1\\exp\\left [ \\left(\\frac{k^2}{q}-q\\right)t \\right ] e^{\\pm 2\\,i\\,\\omega_k\\,t}+c_2\\exp\\frac{-k^2}{q}t.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] let s stress that the last one is only an heuristic estimation of the right solutions ; however eq .   allows some kind of growing amplitude solutions for all modes such that @xmath56 .",
    "the most general case involves a lot of more complicated situations that allow some mixed cases : for example , it could be happen that @xmath57 is in free wave regime while @xmath58 is still in the expanding one ( or viceversa ) .",
    "taking into account all together , it is very interesting to study the `` revealing interference '' .",
    "because of the presence of two different kind of evolving modes , there are also two values of energy @xmath59 and @xmath60 for a given @xmath61 , corresponding to photon traveling in @xmath7-@xmath8 plane and along @xmath6 axis respectively . in order to consider this feature , we propose the following hamiltonian for system s dynamic , without taking care about polarization s degrees of freedom : @xmath62 it is important to underline that eq .",
    "reduces to the normal ordered hamiltonian of free electromagnetic field in the statical isotropic limit , where @xmath63 and degree of freedom associated to anisotropies vanishes .    at this point ,",
    "let s define a quantum state for a single photon travelling with momentum @xmath61 as follow : @xmath64 where the normalization condition must be verified @xmath65 .",
    "also the following relations must be true : @xmath66 and @xmath67 : in this way , a photon traveling along @xmath6-axis ( in @xmath7-@xmath8 plane ) has energy equal to @xmath60 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the simplest choice is @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "in such a way , @xmath70 now , let s consider a quantum superposition of two photons given by : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the angles of the two travel s directions , measured respect to @xmath6 axis , while @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the two phases of the photons .",
    "in such a way , we are able to calculate the average energy for the given state , i.e.     divided by the energy @xmath76 of a single photon .",
    "each curve refers to a different relative phase in photons state . ]",
    "@xmath77.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    in particular , if we consider two photon at the same time traveling along the same direction , i.e. @xmath78 , we obtain : @xmath79.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] this is a very interesting expression ; in fact , an interference term appears when @xmath80 . in this case , the energies became @xmath81 and @xmath82 and so we obtain : @xmath83\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 .",
    "it s surprising that interference term does nt disappear when the anisotropy vanishes ; in that case , in fact , longitudinal and transverse modes become indistinguishable , i.e. @xmath85 so : @xmath86 instead of @xmath87 , as expected in the classical case .",
    "this effect appear because of the anisotropyc expansion of the universe and could constitute early hints for a deviation from the friedman lemaitre robertson walker metric and the possible existence of a preferred axis in the universe .",
    "this new interesting effect can manifests itself in the electromagnetic emission of far highly directional sources , like quasars .",
    "in fact , following @xcite , we consider a universe in the matter - dominated era with a plane - symmetric component given by a uniform magnetic field . in the limit of small eccentricity of the universe we have @xmath88 .",
    "we suppose that the magnetic field is frozen it evolves as @xmath89 .",
    "the energy momentum tensor for a uniform magnetic field ( in the universe ) is @xmath90 with @xmath91 the magnetic energy density . in this way it s possible to obtain the following equation : @xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94 is the density of a magnetic field that generates the anisotropy .",
    "in such a way , we obtain the dependence of eccentricity by the redshift @xmath6 : @xmath95 remebering that @xmath96 and @xmath97 are valued at the decoupling era , we obtain that the eccentricity is @xmath98 for the farest observed quasars ( @xmath99 ) . in other words",
    "the analysis of the spectra of the far quasars may be a good check to study the anisotropy of the universe . on the other hand it is possible that we have a local effect of anisotropic expansion in a cosmological isotropic background , in this way the local anisotropic expansion may be localized by quasars that may show the eccentricity of eq.([ez ] ) .",
    "this requires a detailed study that we postpone to future analysis .",
