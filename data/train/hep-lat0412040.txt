    "two - dimensional ( @xmath7 ) lattice spin models , besides being interesting on their own right as models of ferromagnets can be viewed as mathematically well defined scheme of the nonperturbative regularization of quantum continuum field theories like @xmath0 principal chiral model or @xmath8 nonlinear sigma model . being a discrete theory lattice models can be simulated on computers by monte - carlo method , and this is nowadays the most important tool of obtaining physical results near the continuum limit . among major analytical methods one could mention the strong coupling expansion and the perturbation theory ( pt ) .",
    "the pt is essentially the only analytical tool which provides systematic expansion of different physical quantities in the region of weak coupling , i.e. in the region relevant for the construction of the continuum limit .",
    "however , at the best pt is only applicable for studying short - distance quantities and the most important and interesting phenomena , like the mass gap generation can not be described in its frameworks . when attempting to go beyond pt in the region of weak bare coupling , one runs into various mathematical problems , the most important being an absence of any analytical control over exponentially small contributions and , hence the absence of any reliable method to study long - distance physics where nonperturbative effects dominate even if they are exponentially suppressed .",
    "these facts impelled people to look for different , though equivalent representations which would allow to study the long - distance physics .",
    "one of such popular and promising representations is known as a dual formulation and is based on a certain non - classical change of variables .",
    "this formulation deals with dual lattice and appears to be very fruitfull for abelian models @xcite .",
    "namely , within such formulation 1 ) have been obtained various important analytical results on the long - distance dynamics of abelian spin fields and 2 ) the topological structure of the vacuum is transparent and can be more easily studied .    in the context relevant to this paper",
    "we would like to mention the dual of the abelian @xmath4 model @xcite which has been used to prove the existence of a soft phase at low temperatures with power - like decay of the correlation function in two - dimensional @xmath4 model @xcite . in this case",
    "the dual of the @xmath4 model is a local theory for certain discrete variables .",
    "the conventional dual transformations @xcite for non - abelian models are perfectly well defined in mathematical terms and also lead to a local dual theory for integers which label irreducible representations of the symmetry group",
    ". nevertheless , these transformations are not complete if one compares to the abelian case .",
    "first of all , the resulting dual variables are not independent but are subject to some constraints known as triangular conditions , and as such they can not really be associated with elements of a dual lattice ( of course , introduction of the dual lattice is not the crucial point but rather matter of convenience ; e.g. , in the abelian case one can work with dual variables on the original lattice ) .",
    "it is to say , however that it is not really clear what are true independent degrees of freedom of the duals of non - abelian models .",
    "secondly , such formulation is so mathematically involved that today it is even far from obvious if it can be useful for any kind of the study of the model , except for the strong coupling expansion . in particular , the positivity of the boltzmann weight remains unclear ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "even the precise definition of what can be termed the dual boltzmann weight is not really obvious , so the possibility of numerical simulations is at present rather uncertain .",
    "most importantly , however is that it is not clear how one could proceed in an analytical study of the model at low - temperatures . ] .    on the other hand",
    ", there exists representation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 spin models in terms of link variables @xcite , and this representation can be formulated directly on the dual lattice .",
    "it is a first goal of the present paper to use the link representation for the derivation of an exact dual formulation of non - abelian spin models .",
    "here we give two such formulations which appear to be quite different from the conventional formulation mentioned above . in our opinion",
    "the most essential advantages of our formulations are that 1 ) one of them can be definitely used for the monte - carlo simulations in @xmath7 and 2 ) they are much more suitable for an analytical investigation of the model in the low - temperature region .",
    "the second fact follows from the properties of the link formulation and we refer for the details of why it is so to our papers @xcite . in the last of those papers we have already presented a dual of @xmath7 @xmath5 spin model and proposed approximate representation for the dual partition function at low temperatures . another important feature of one of our formulations is that it carries a close analogy with the abelian @xmath9 model .",
    "for instance , for @xmath7 @xmath5 model there are 3 independent degrees of freedom per ( dual ) site . at low temperatures it possesses an analog of the vortex  spin - wave representation , etc .",
    "the deficiency of our approach is that it can be straightforwardly applied only to models in which spins are elements of the lie group .",
    "we do not know any obvious generalization of link formulation to , say , @xmath8 nonlinear sigma models .",
    "low - temperature properties of @xmath7 non - abelian models are crucial for construction of their continuum limit .",
    "it is commonly recognized that models possess no phase transition , correlation function has exponential decay at any coupling and models are asymptotically free . despite being more",
    "than twenty five years old this expectation has not been proven rigorously . on the contrary",
    ", certain percolation theory arguments suggest that all non - abelian models have soft low - temperature phase with power - like decay of the correlation function @xcite .",
    "it is thus another important motivation of the present investigation , namely to get deeper insight into the nature of the mass gap in non - abelian spin models .",
    "for example , in many papers devoted to @xmath7 non - abelian models it is written that `` there is a nonperturbative mass gap generation at arbitrarily small couplings '' .",
    "it is not really clear , however what is precise meaning of this `` nonperturbative generation '' .",
    "it can not be a simple consequence of the link decorrelation which happens in @xmath10 models .",
    "then , one could ask if this `` nonperturbative generation '' follows from the existence of some non - trivial background of defects like vortices of the @xmath4 model or is due to the strong but smooth disorder of non - abelian spins , e.g. like center vortices @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the dual formulation of abelian models have been extremely useful in clarifying all these important physical problems @xcite .",
    "we think that the dual formulation given here is a good starting point for obtaining reliable analytical results in the low - temperature limit of non - abelian models .",
    "this is our next goal to develop a technique within dual formulation of non - abelian models which would allow to investigate them in the limit of the weak coupling . in this context",
    "we study here the following two approaches on the simplest example of @xmath5 spin model    * we derive an asymptotic expansion of the dual boltzmann weight when @xmath11 uniformly valid in fluctuations of the dual variables .",
    "the same procedure is also done for the two - point correlation function . as will be seen , at low temperatures",
    "the boltzmann weight converges to a certain gaussian ensemble  the fact which ensures a possibility to define an analog of the vortex  spin - wave representation for the partition and correlation functions in the semiclassical limit .",
    "this step provides a major simplification of the model as @xmath11 but even in this case it can not be yet solved exactly .",
    "the formulation obtained permits very simple calculation of the leading perturbative contribution to the correlation function .",
    "this contribution results in the power - like decay of the correlation function . *",
    "the second approach consists in replacing @xmath5 matrix elements by @xmath6 ones in the vicinity of the identity element of @xmath5",
    ". we shall give a proof that such replacement is valid at low temperatures , compute the asymptotics of the dual boltzmann weight and present simple numerical evidence that practically for all configurations this way of calculations produces very reasonable approximation for the original boltzmann weight .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the section 2",
    "we review briefly the conventional dual transformations .",
    "after introduction of the link formulation we develop original approach to the dual transformations and present two forms of the duals of the principal chiral model . in the section 3",
    "we investigate the low - temperature properties of the dual boltzmann weights of @xmath5 model in two dimensions along the lines described above .",
    "some technical details of this investigation are given in the appendix . in the section 4",
    "we summarize our results and outline some perspectives for future investigations .",
    "also , we calculate here the leading perturbative contribution to the correlation function .",
    "we work on a @xmath2-dimensional hypercubic lattice @xmath12 with lattice spacing @xmath13 and a linear extension @xmath14 .",
    "we impose either free or periodic boundary conditions ( bc ) .",
    "let @xmath15 ; @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the haar measure on @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 will denote the character and dimension of irreducible representation @xmath21 of @xmath18 , correspondingly .",

    "fourier expansion of the boltzmann weight @xmath29 .",
    "this is an essentially character expansion on the group .",
    "2 .   exact integration over original degrees of freedom . as a result one obtains a set of constraints on the summation variables ( which label representations of the group @xmath18 and matrix elements of @xmath30 ) in the character expansion .",
    "solution of the constraints in terms of new dual variables .",
    "performing the first step one finds for the pf @xmath31 \\right ] \\prod_{x\\in\\lambda } q(x ) \\ ,   \\label{pfst1}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 denotes links of the lattice and @xmath33 is a group integral",

    "we consider only the simplest cases of @xmath37 and @xmath38 in two dimensions .",
    "these examples already show a marked difference between abelian and non - abelian models , on the one hand . on the other hand , we want to have relatively simple formulae which can be compared with our formulations . for the @xmath9 model",
    "we have @xmath39 \\right ) \\ , \\label{qxu1}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the kronecker delta . in @xmath0 case",
    "the result for @xmath33 in @xcite is expressed in terms of the haar intertwiners .",

    "the third step can be readily accomplished for the @xmath9 model .",
    "we skip all the details of the derivation which are well known and can be found , for example in @xcite .",
    "the result for the pf reads @xmath48 where the product runs over all links of the dual lattice @xmath49 and the dual boltzmann weight is given by @xmath50 \\ , \\label{dualbwxy}\\ ] ] which in the case of the standard choice @xmath51 leads to @xmath52 with @xmath53 - the modified bessel function .",
    "unfortunately , situation is much more difficult for non - abelian case . @xmath33 for @xmath5",
    "contains not just one but 4 conditions : 2 kronecker delta s which constrain magnetic numbers @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xmath54 and 2 triangular conditions on representations @xmath55 we are not aware of any attempts in the literature to resolve these constraints simultaneously for all lattice sites . of course , this does not cause much problems for the strong coupling expansion where only lowest values of @xmath56 contribute .",
    "but situation becomes hopeless in the low temperature region where probably all @xmath56 become relevant .",
    "eventually , this reduces to the problem of finding the appropriate summation technique when @xmath11 which we could not solve .",
    "moreover , @xmath33 as defined in ( [ qxsu2 ] ) is not strictly positive quantity : on a number of configurations it is negative .",
    "we do not know how to perform resummation over the magnetic numbers to get positive boltzmann weight .",
    "most probably , only complete summation over all magnetic numbers will produce positive quantity .",
    "one of the possible ways of how to proceed further is to go over to the triangular lattices identifying representations with the length of the sides of triangles and magnetic numbers with the orientation of the triangles , and we have undertaken some attempts to go along this line .",
    "detailed description of this procedure is however beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we turn now to a different approach to duality transformations based on so - called link representation for partition and correlation functions .",
    "that is , the three steps formulated in the beginning of the previous subsection are replaced by the following ones    1 .",
    "change of variables in the partition function ( [ pfdef ] ) @xmath57 integration over original degrees of freedom .",
    "this integration generates a set of constraints on the link matrices @xmath58 known as the bianchi identities . 2 .   implementation of constraints into the partition function by making use of the invariant delta - function on the group .",
    "this step introduces new degrees of freedom which can be associated with plaquettes of the original lattice and which label the irreducible representations of the group @xmath18 . at this step one",
    "can go over to the dual lattice so that the new variables belong to the elements of the dual lattice .",
    "integration over link variables .",
    "these two steps give already some dual version of the principal chiral model .",
    "3 .   before integration over link variables one can decouple summations over matrix indices employing certain orthogonality relations for the cg coefficients ( or for some other objects ) of the group and multiplying the group matrices entering",
    "bianchi identity in some specially ordered way . though details depend on the dimension of the lattice",
    "the result is that only independent dual variables remain in the theory and their interaction is confined to a subset of all hypercubes of the dual lattice .",

    "much less trivial task is to get weak coupling expansion for @xmath121 since all @xmath124 in the series ( [ xio2dexact ] ) become relevant .",
