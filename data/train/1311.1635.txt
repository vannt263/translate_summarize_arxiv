    "observing from mcdonald observatory at a maximum altitude of 14@xmath2 , @xcite reported the b2 star hd124448 to `` show no hydrogen lines , either in absorption or in emission , although the helium lines are sharp and strong ... the abundance of hydrogen appears to be very low in the atmosphere of this star '' .",
    "indeed , hd124448 turned out to be the first of around 20 b- and early a- supergiants , with apparent magnitude @xmath3 , in which hydrogen comprises less than 1 part per thousand of the atmosphere . in terms of kinematics , metallicity and galactic distribution",
    ", they have the properties of the galactic bulge @xcite . with luminosities",
    "approximately ten thousand times solar , the number count is complete for the observable parts of the galaxy ( fainter stars would lie beyond ) .",
    "in addition to their low hydrogen abundances , the true `` extreme helium stars '' ( ehes ) show atmospheres which are enriched in nitrogen by a factor ten , carbon by between one and three parts per hundred , and sometimes oxygen by a similar amount .",
    "the combination of extreme surface composition and extreme rarity makes these stars interesting , and presents a challenge for the theory of stellar evolution .",
    "the general properties of ehes have prompted suggestions of a connection to the cooler rcoronae borealis stars @xcite , which are better known for their spectacular and unpredictable light variability @xcite .",
    "figure [ f : hdef ] shows the distribution by surface gravity and effective temperature of several classes of hydrogen - deficient star ; stars falling on an imaginary line parallel to the eddington limit would have the same luminosity - to - mass ratio , corresponding to the evolutionary path of a giant contracting to become a white dwarf .",
    "links between non - variable hydrogen - deficient carbon ( hdc ) , rcoronae borealis ( rcb ) , extreme helium ( ehe ) , luminous helium - rich subdwarf o ( hesdo@xmath4 ) and o(he ) stars have all been suggested at one time or another .",

    "ehe stars are denoted by squares ( light grey , green online ) , as are rcb ( dark grey , red online ) , hdc ( open squares ) , hesdo@xmath4 ( back , blue online ) and o(he ) ( mid - grey , violet online ) stars.,width=453 ]    in order to establish the origin of ehes and related objects , temperatures and gravities are required .",
    "additional observables are provided by the surface composition and by the fact that many ehes are pulsating .",
    "pulsations provide an opportunity to make direct measurements of mass and radius .",
    "this paper reviews the spectroscopic data on surface composition , summarizes the principal theories for the evolutionary origin , and discusses the major pulsation properties .",
    "it concludes with a synopsis of the extraordinary pulsating ehe v652herculis .",
    "the depleted hydrogen surfaces of ehes indicate that a mixture of nuclear - processed helium and carbon has been exposed .",
    "abundance analyses have been carried out on the basis of optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy using primarily lte methods @xcite ; some partial non - lte analyses have been executed @xcite .",

    "together , these results point to the co - existence of material produced by cno - cycled hydrogen burning , and by 3@xmath7 , @xmath8c+@xmath7 and @xmath9n+@xmath7 helium burning .",
    "there is evidence from rcbs that the large oxygen excesses are due to a short - lived phase of @xmath9n+@xmath11o burning @xcite .",
    "there are also relics of primordial hydrogen and , in some stars , s - process elements from a previous agb phase . a theory for the origin of ehes must be able to explain the co - existence of all of these products on their surfaces .",
    "@xcite reviewed extant proposals for the origin of rcbs and ehes .",
    "several authors have investigated the evolution of single helium stars from the helium main - sequence to become helium - shell burning giants @xcite .",
    "such models mimic the general properties of rcbs and ehes , but generally fail to explain the detailed surface mixtures  even if it could be established how the helium main - sequence stars would form in the first place .",
    "@xcite had proposed a model involving `` deep envelope mixing '' on the asymptotic giant branch , which fell short of establishing a mechanism to drive the necessary mixing .",
    "@xcite introduced the notion of `` hot bottom burning '' in which a vigorous nuclear - burning shell is sufficiently luminous to drive convection to the stellar surface .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite and @xcite concluded that ehes `` can be understood as the remnants of red giant stars that have lost their hydrogen - rich envelope during their ascent along the asymptotic giant branch . ''",
    "all three proposals struggle to fully account for the observed surface chemistries .",
    "@xcite proposed that stars which experience a late thermal pulse ( ltp , or helium - shell flash ) after leaving the agb would return to the cool giant regime and there be identified as rcb stars .",
    "there would be mixing between the hydrogen - rich surface layers , the helium - rich intershell , and helium shell - flash products which would become visible at a now hydrogen - deficient surface .",
    "the principles behind the ltp had been previously predicted by @xcite and demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "in fact , two cases had been identified , which were later described more fully by @xcite . in a _",
    "late _ thermal pulse , generally on the constant - luminosity part of the post - agb contraction curve , there is no mixing between h - rich and he - rich matter ( and hence no production of s - process elements ) at the time of the flash ; helium is dredged up as the star cools and surface convection penetrates into the helium - rich layers from above . in",
    "a _ very late _ thermal pulse , generally when the star is on or almost on the white dwarf cooling track , the helium - shell flash is more violent and flash - driven convection mixes helium- and carbon - rich material directly to the surface .",
    "both models have some attraction for the origin of rcb stars but have more weaknesses than strengths @xcite .",
    "they are important in discussing the origin of `` born - again '' stars like fgsge ( late thermal pulse , @xcite ) , v4334sgr ( very - late thermal pulse @xcite ) , and hydrogen - deficient pn central stars and pg1159 stars @xcite .      at around the same time as the ltp model emerged , @xcite and @xcite realised that a binary system containing two white dwarfs with a period less than about two hours should lose orbital energy by the radiation of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "subsequently the white dwarfs would collide in a timescale less than the hubble time . in the case of small mass ratios",
    ", the collision will likely be in the form of stable roche - lobe overflow , identified as a possible origin for the amcvn stars , which are low mass hydrogen - deficient white - dwarf binary systems @xcite . with a mass ratio closer to unity",
    ", the rate of mass loss would be such that the rate of radius increase of the mass - losing white dwarf ( @xmath12 ) leads to run - away mass transfer , the destruction of the less massive white dwarf , and its immediate accretion onto the surface of its more massive companion .",
    "the overall outcome depends on the composition of the white dwarfs and the total mass of the merged product .",
    "for example , a helium white dwarf ( he - wd ) accreted onto a carbon - oxygen white dwarf ( co - wd ) with a total mass less than the chandasekhar mass results in the ignition of shell - helium burning at the helium / carbon boundary , and the expansion of the star to become a supergiant , with a hydrogen - poor surface , as in the rcb stars . a more massive merger could produce a type ia supernova .",
    "this connection beween rcb stars and sn ia , already recognised by @xcite , makes the study of double white - dwarf mergers , and of rcb and ehe stars , of considerable interest @xcite .",
    "since the predictions by @xcite and @xcite , there have been several strands to calculations of white - dwarf mergers .",
    "briefly , these include :    * hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "early simulations demonstrated that the donor white dwarf would disrupt on a dynamical timescale and rapidly form a hot corona and a keplerian disk surrounding the accretor @xcite .",
    "only recently have large grids of simulations been completed , and only recently have simulations included a detailed calculation of nucleosynthesis during the merger .",
    "an important question is whether these mergers are `` hot '' or `` cold '' ; i.e. is the initial helium - shell ignition sufficiently hot and of sufficient duration to drive nucleosynthesis ( e.g. @xmath13 ) that would explain the more exotic aspects of ehe and rcb chemistry .",
    "a significant result is that , because the donor has further to fall into the potential well , mergers with large mass ratios ( @xmath14 ) are hotter and therefore more likely to produce @xmath9n+@xmath7 products than mergers with smaller mass ratios . *",
    "post - merger evolution .",
    "@xcite showed that a 0.6 or 0.7@xmath15 co - wd accreting between 0.1 and 0.3@xmath15 of helium at half the eddington rate would ignite said helium and expand to produce a giant with the mass , luminosity , temperature and basic composition of an rcb star .",
    "after shell helium exhaustion , these models contracted with properties corresponding to observations of ehe stars .",
    "the detailed surface chemistries could be explained in an _ ad hoc _ fashion using a simple recipe based on the pre - merger composition of the various hydrogen - rich , helium - rich and carbon - rich layers of the progenitor white dwarfs . with a decade of additional abundance data for both ehe and rcb stars",
    ", @xcite extended this simple recipe ; in particular they suggested that the fluorine , neon and phosphorus overabundances could originate in the agb intershell of the co - wd , with @xmath16 coming from a pocket close to the carbon - helium boundary in the co - wd ( in their models ) .",
    "this , together with near - normal abundances of magnesium , points to progenitor main - sequence stars with initial masses in the range 1.93@xmath15 .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , argue that most of the excess exotics can be produced during a `` hot '' merger . * population statistics .",
    "the expectation of producing sufficient dwd mergers to populate the galaxy with rcbs and ehes is obtained by comparing the expected numbers of double white dwarfs , with appropriate masses and periods , with the gravitational - radiation orbital - decay times .",
    "the galactic merger rate can then be multiplied by the predicted lifetimes of post - merger stars as rcbs and ehes .",
    "the first qualitative estimates were made by @xcite , and confirmed by @xcite to give a co+he merger rate of @xmath17  @xmath18 . with a contraction ( thermal ) timescale of @xmath19  yr , there should be @xmath20 ehes in the galaxy , consistent with the observed number .",
    "however , @xcite showed that binary - star population synthesis ( bsps ) contains large error margins , so the apparent agreement should be taken with a pinch of salt .",
    "a significant problem still to be resolved is that the bsps calculations show most co+he mergers at the current epoch should come from relatively young systems ( @xmath21 gyr ) , which is inconsistent with the galactic bulge distribution of ehe and rcb stars . *",
    "dynamical stability .",
    "mass ratio plays a key role in whether a double white dwarf binary merges or transfers matter slowly when one component fills its roche lobe @xcite ; the primary factor is the rate of change of semi - major axis compared with the expansion rate of the mass - losing star , which gives a critical ratio @xmath22 @xcite . the question is closely connected with the efficiency of mass transfer and factors such as synchronicity and nuclear reactivity .",
    "it is important , as it strongly affects the population statistics , but appears far from resolved .",
    "* angular momentum .",
    "the coalescence of two stars in a short - period orbit raises the questions of ( a ) whether the accretor can continue to accrete as it spins up and ( b ) whether the total angular momentum of the product would cause it to break up .",
    "assuming angular momentum to be conserved within the system , there is an expectation that a contracting rcb star would spin up to beyond breakup @xcite .",
    "however if the surface velocity is close to the kepler velocity , angular momentum is transported efficiently from the star to the disk so that accretion continues as long as matter around the star exists @xcite , and viscous disks are known to be very efficient transporters of angular momentum outward and of mass inward @xcite . * progenitors .",
    "the question of whether low - mass short - period double white - dwarf binaries capable of forming ehe stars are produced by binary - star evolution has been emphatically answered by the discovery of significant numbers of such systems @xcite .",
    "curiously , there is a connection between the dwd merger model and the single - star evolution models of @xcite and others .",
    "@xcite extended the work of @xcite on double he - wd mergers to investigate the formation of helium - rich sdo and sdb stars , which are essentially low - mass helium main - sequence stars .",
    "@xcite found that , in a few cases , hesdo stars formed from the most massive double he - wd mergers would become carbon - rich helium giants during a he - shell burning phase after core - helium depletion .",
    "however , the he+he channel provides less than 1% of the rcb and ehe stars provided by the co+he channel .",

    "<S> these pulsations have unusual properties , some being `` strange '' modes , and others being driven by @xmath1-bump opacities . </S>",
    "<S> they have the potential to deliver distance - independent masses and to provide a unique view of pulsation physics .    </S>",
    "<S> we review the evolutionary origin and pulsations of these stars , and introduce recent progress and continuing challenges . </S>"
