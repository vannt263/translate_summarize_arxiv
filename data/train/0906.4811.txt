    "relativistic electron - positron pair plasmas are found in many astrophysical objects such as neutron star magnetospheres @xcite , relativistic jets and accretion disks associated with black holes in the centers of active galactic nuclei @xcite . to study the properties of the pair plasma in these objects it is imperative to employ a fully relativistic approach . in the study of magnetized pair plasmas",
    "one finds that a number of oscillation modes exist ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the focus of this study is to investigate the behavior of bernstein modes in a uniform , magnetized , relativistic @xmath0 pair plasma .",
    "bernstein waves are electrostatic undulations that are always localized near the electron cyclotron harmonics in an electron - ion plasma @xcite",
    ". these waves can propagate undamped only very close to the plane perpendicular to the static magnetic field .",
    "such waves are of great interest since , in an electron - ion plasma , they strongly interact with the electrons and are excellent candidates for plasma heating and driving currents as compared with the electromagnetic ( o)rdinary and the e(x)traordinary modes @xcite .",
    "the non - relativistic treatment of bernstein waves in an electron - ion plasma is well understood @xcite .",
    "it is the fully relativistic case that is marred by difficulties such that a closed form analytic solution is hard to formulate or maybe even impossible .",
    "many workers have expounded on the fully relativistic treatment of electron bernstein waves @xcite , the ultrarelativistic case @xcite , and have successfully obtained approximate dispersion relations @xcite .",
    "the bernstein mode in a weakly relativistic pair plasma has been investigated by the authors of @xcite where they have found closed curve dispersion relations that are remarkably distinct from the classical case .",
    "all of these studies either discuss the fully relativistic case to the point where no closed form analytic solution is found , or simplify the analysis by either treating the limiting case only or employ various approximations that may not yield an entirely correct result .    in this paper , we present a fully relativistic treatment of bernstein waves in a pair plasma and provide dispersion curves that highlight the transition from the weakly to strongly relativistic regime .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as the following .",
    "we derive the key equations for the dielectric response tensor and describe our numerical approach to the problem in the following section (   [ sec : relat - disp - relat ] ) . in section  [ sec : prop - disp - curv ] , we present the main results of this study along with a discussion on how the solution behaves as a function of the plasma temperature , and plasma frequency . in the final section (   [ sec : discussion ] )",
    "we highlight some of the important points of the study .",
    "the evolution of the distribution function , @xmath1 , of plasma particles in phase space is governed by the vlasov equation , which in the momentum representation is given as @xmath2 where @xmath3 indicates different species constituting the plasma . to investigate the behavior of small amplitude waves with oscillation periods much smaller than particle collision times , we make the following assumptions @xmath4 where the subscripts @xmath5 and @xmath6 indicate equilibrium and perturbed functions , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we restrict the equilibrium distribution function to only depend on the momentum of the particles to account for the anisotropy introduced by the ambient static magnetic field . as a result , we write the vlasov equation in its linearized form @xmath7 the main idea here is to calculate the perturbation of the distribution function by integrating along the unperturbed orbits from some time in the past , say @xmath8 , to the present time @xmath9 .",
    "next , we use ohm s law to write the current density induced by the perturbed distribution @xmath10 this enables us to write the effective dielectric permittivity tensor in terms of the conductivity tensor @xmath11 @xcite @xmath12 in the fully relativistic approximation , the energy and linear momentum of particles in the rest frame of the plasma are given as @xmath13 where the lorentz factor is given in terms of the momentum as @xmath14 the complete details of the rest of the calculation can be found in various monographs and textbooks on plasma waves ( see @xcite ) , and we only provide the salient points of the derivation in what follows .",
    "we adopt @xmath15 for the equilibrium magnetic field and restrict both the wave vector and the perturbed electric field to be @xmath16 and @xmath17 as dictated by the purely electrostatic mode where the perturbed magnetic field @xmath18vanishes .",

    "finally , one finds the dispersion relation , @xmath32 , by setting the dielectric response function to zero , @xmath33 which in our case simply picks out the @xmath34 component . to keep the treatment fully relativistic we adopt the maxwell - boltzmann - jtner distribution function @xcite , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the ratio of the rest mass energy of the particles to that of their thermal energy , and",
    "@xmath37 is the modified bessel function of the second kind and of order two .",
    "also , the equilibrium plasma distribution has been normalized to unity @xmath38 taking the derivative of @xmath39 with respect to @xmath40 and @xmath41 yields @xmath42 where @xmath43 can be replaced by either @xmath24 or @xmath25 components . at this point",

    "( [ eq : exx ] ) consists of a hypergeometric function which is singular for @xmath52 for integer @xmath53 .",
    "this singular behavior , as we shall see , is associated to the phenomenon of cyclotron resonance where plasma particles are in resonance with the wave at the cyclotron harmonics .",
    "also , this very resonance poses a real challenge for any numerical computation of the integral and has to be dealt with using advanced numerical techniques . since our interest lies in finding the oscillation frequency @xmath54 as a function of the wavenumber @xmath55 , it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq : exx ] ) that this operation is explicitly nonlinear .",
    "therefore , one is left with an exercise of root finding for a given @xmath54 .",
    "alternatively , one could simplify the analysis by making some approximation .",
    "however , by adopting such methodology one risks losing the subtleties of the solution and may obtain something that is not entirely correct , as we show in the weakly relativistic case .",
    "we remain optimistic and decide to compute the dispersion relation using a brute force method , that is by simply integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : exx ] ) .",
    "as the lorentz factor is a function of momentum , the integrand remains singular over the domain of integration .",
    "a workaround for avoiding the singular points on the real axis is by analytically continuing the momentum to the complex domain .",
    "we can easily shift the integration contour below the real axis by writing @xmath56 where @xmath57 is reasonably small .",
    "ideally , one would like to keep the contour on the real axis but go below the singular points to avoid divergence while following the landau prescription @xcite .",
    "a similar result can be achieved by closing the contour of integration in the lower half of the complex plane as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] .",
    "-plane used to avoid singular points of the integrand . only the general case is shown here to guide the reader . ]    here we are interested in finding the principal value of the integral in eq .",

    "when @xmath54 and @xmath62 are kept real , one finds that @xmath60 is also real which makes the first term on the right in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pv ] ) purely imaginary",
    ". however , the second term has both real and imaginary components , and the negative sign is indicative of the clockwise sense of the contour . since the left hand side is real then so must be the right , which suggests that the imaginary components cancel each other and yields the following result @xmath63    although it appears that with the given prescription one can have an arbitrarily large @xmath57 , we find that the integral does start to lose its accuracy as @xmath57 approaches unity .",
    "therefore , we set @xmath64 for all numerical computations . to compute the integral numerically over the hypergeometric function we used mathematica ( v.6 ) for it is capable of calculating generalized hypergeometric functions .",
    "the poles of the integrand were dealt with by employing a globally adaptive integration routine available in mathematica . to speed up the integration over the singular points we used the double exponential quadrature singularity handler built into mathematica s integration routine .",
    "in the non - relativistic case of the electron bernstein modes in an electron - ion plasma , one finds that there are no wave modes below the first harmonic .",
    "the dispersion curves above the hybrid frequency are all bell shaped with local maxima corresponding to stationary modes",
    ". furthermore , band gaps are present above the hybrid frequency between each dispersion curve .",
    "it is not at all surprising to say that the picture is remarkably different in the relativistic pair plasma scenario .",
    "we plot the dispersion curves for a relativistic pair plasma in fig .",
    "[ fig : wp3eta1 ] , [ fig : wp3eta5 ] , [ fig : wp3eta20 ] for different values of @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "we assume a plasma frequency of @xmath66 for these plots .",
    "the dispersion relation for a moderately relativistic pair plasma , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wp3eta1 ] , clearly has two wave modes .",
    "this is further accompanied by the existence of two stationary modes with vanishing group velocity ( @xmath67 ) at two distinct oscillation frequencies for @xmath68 .",
    "also , above the higher stationary mode there are two wavenumber solutions for a given @xmath54 .",
    "this behavior persists in the case of a mildly relativistic pair plasma , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wp3eta5 ] .",
    "however , one sees some drastic changes in the shape of the dispersion curves as the particles lose their energy .",
    "we readily notice the appearance of the curve near the cyclotron fundamental frequency .",
    "this marks the onset of the cyclotron resonance where the plasma particles oscillate at the same frequency as the perturbing electrostatic wave .",
    "although not very significant at this point , the higher harmonic resonances also start to emerge .",
    "furthermore , the dispersion relation now extends to higher wavenumbers and the turnover from the lower wave mode into the upper mode is not as sharp as it was in the previous case .",
    "we also notice a shift in the stationary modes , and we discuss this point in a later section .    , @xmath69 .",

    "the authors of @xcite reported the dispersion relation for a weakly relativistic pair plasma .",
    "they found island shaped curves occurring mostly between the cyclotron harmonics .",
    "we find a similar solution for the weakly relativistic case , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wp3eta20 ] , but with a few exceptions .",
    "firstly , the dispersion curves are no longer closed but extend to higher wavenumbers as they approach cyclotron harmonics .",
    "this behavior is very similar to what we observe in the case of a non - relativistic electron - ion plasma .",
    "however , in the pair plasma case the solution does not extend to an infinitely large wavenumber , and there are not infinitely many wave modes as we increase @xmath54 .",
    "there appears to be a cutoff in frequency , the point where the overturn takes place , beyond which there does not exist any solution .",
    "secondly , there exists a wave mode below the fundamental cyclotron harmonic which was absent in the solution provided in @xcite .",
    "in fact , we find that a solution below the cyclotron fundamental exists for all cases , regardless of @xmath70 , for @xmath66 as we show below . this , again , is in contrast with the non - relativistic electron - ion plasma where there is no wave mode below the first harmonic .    in comparison to the moderately relativistic case , the weakly relativistic case is richer in its behavior as well as much more structured .",
    "the former only has two frequency modes for a given wavelength , namely a high and a low mode , and the latter has many .",
    "moreover , for a moderately relativistic pair plasma none of the wave modes found in between the two stationary points ( discussed below ) extend to infinitely small wavelengths .",
    "in fact , there is a limiting wavelength above which these modes exist . as reported in @xcite",
    ", one can find similar , although much less severe , imperfections in the graphics produced by the contouring algorithm .",

    "we now plot all of the dispersion curves shown earlier onto a single plot and analyze the progression from the weakly relativistic case to the strongly relativistic one ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : wp3all ] ) . the bernstein waves are strongly absorbed near the cyclotron harmonics in the weakly relativistic limit where @xmath75 .",
    "this effect is the strongest at the first cyclotron harmonic at which point the phase velocity of the wave @xmath76 and the wave loses all of its energy in heating up the pair plasma . at higher harmonics",
    "the same phenomenon is repeated , however with decreased efficiency . upon increasing the thermal speed of the plasma particles ,",
    "the cyclotron resonances become much less pronounced and start to disappear completely . in a hot magnetized pair",
    "plasma no resonant interaction between the bernstein wave and the plasma occurs , and the solution occupies only a small region of the @xmath77 space .      unlike the non - relativistic electron bernstein waves ,",

    "consequently , @xmath34 loses its dependence on @xmath54 because the only place @xmath54 appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exx ] ) is inside the hypergeometric function .",
    "moreover , this suggests that @xmath81 is constant in the domain where @xmath82 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : exx ] ) fails to describe the behavior of the dispersion relation for vanishing @xmath83 .",
    "in fact , one has to keep terms in the infinite sum up to order @xmath84 to obtain any non - trivial solution .",

    "nevertheless , this problem can be resolved easily . upon cursory inspection of the integrand",
    "one finds that it is quadratic in @xmath83 , making it symmetric under the transformation @xmath85 .",
    "furthermore , we demand that the dispersion relation be continuous at @xmath86 , thus , we employ polynomial interpolation to determine the @xmath87-intercept . in all three figures we use a polynomial of order 2 or 4 , depending on the shape of the curve , to determine the stationary points for vanishing wavenumber .      in the weakly relativistic case ,",
    "one finds wave - particle resonances occurring at cyclotron harmonics .",
    "these resonances extend to large values of @xmath83 but not to infinity .",
    "intuitively , one may argue , by looking at the rest of the dispersion solution , that such a behavior is expected as the dispersion curves start and end at @xmath88 .",

    "this exercise demonstrates that the resonances do not extend to infinitely small wavelengths , that there is some cutoff at @xmath109 , and the dispersion curves remain connected over the whole domain .",
    "more importantly , one must not forget that this estimate is particularly inaccurate for the strongly relativistic case where the solution exists for only modest values of @xmath83 .",
