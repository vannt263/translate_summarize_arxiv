    "in the past 15 years , two nasa missions have revolutionized our knowledge of the diffuse interstellar medium . the path - breaking infrared astronomy satellite ( iras )",
    "mission of 1983 led to the first full - sky maps of the diffuse background radiation in four broadband infrared channels , centered at 12 , 25 , 60 , and @xmath0 , with a @xmath15 arcminute beam . the dirbe experiment (",
    "diffuse infrared background experiment ) onboard the cobe satellite imaged the full sky in 10 broad photometric bands from @xmath16 to @xmath1 with a beam of @xmath17 .",
    "this experiment , for all but the shortest wavelength channels , was active for 42 weeks in 1989 - 1990 before its @xmath18 cryogen was exhausted .",
    "although iras was optimized to detect point sources and sources of small angular extent ( beichman et al .",
    "1988 ) , it has been possible to create large area sky maps from the iras data stream ( issa images : @xcite ) . striping artifacts from time variation in the zodiacal foreground emission has largely been filtered out of the individual issa maps , but artifacts remain and the zero - point has large - scale drifts across the images .",
    "the dirbe experiment had a much better control of the absolute calibration and has two channels further to the submillimeter than does iras ( at @xmath7 and @xmath1 ) , but the maps have much less angular resolution .",
    "the diffuse emission seen in these experiments is a superposition of zodiacal foreground emission , dust and molecular emission from the interstellar medium ( ism ) , point sources from within and beyond the milky way , and possibly a diffuse extragalactic background .",
    "separating these components has proven to be a most difficult task ( @xcite ) .",
    "the zodiacal emission dominates the @xmath19 and @xmath5 channels and is a quite serious contaminant at @xmath20 , while its contribution to the @xmath0 maps is less strong .",
    "modelling of the zodiacal emission has proven quite complex ( @xcite ) .",
    "one must consider that the zodiacal dust in the ecliptic plane has a distribution of temperatures , that the tilt of earth s orbit relative to the midplane of the dust is readily detectable , and that the zodiacal emission shows a strong dependence on solar elongation , information which is lost if one uses only the annual - averaged map of the dirbe data .",
    "a full - sky map of the diffuse radiation serves many purposes , and we here report our efforts to combine the @xmath0 maps of iras and dirbe in a manner designed to be accessible to the general astrophysical community . to construct this map ,",
    "we have removed the zodiacal foreground emission from the dirbe maps , removed striping artifacts from the iras / issa maps , subtracted confirmed point sources , and combined the maps in such a way as to preserve the dirbe calibration and iras resolution .",
    "we have used the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath1 emission to deduce a dust color temperature , allowing us to translate the @xmath0 emission to a column density of radiating dust .",
    "such a procedure may be inadequate towards complex , dense clouds at low galactic latitude , but in most directions the emission is dominated by dust within a single environment and radiation field .",
    "since the diffuse emission in the infrared is a direct measure of the column density of the interstellar dust , such a map can be used as a measure of extinction for extragalactic objects .",
    "as we shall argue below , the new dust map has better angular resolution and better control of systematics than possible with the reddening maps of burstein & heiles ( 1978 , 1982 ) .",
    "the essence of the burstein - heiles procedure was to assume that variations in the dust - to - neutral - gas ratio can be adequately modelled by the smoothed mean background of galaxies ( at northern declinations ) , or that this ratio is constant ( at southern declinations ) .",
    "we make no assumptions about variations in dust - to - gas ; neither do we need make any assumption about the correlation of diffuse ionized gas with neutral hydrogen .",
    "we only make the weaker assumption that the distribution of dust grain sizes is everywhere the same , since the relationship between uv / optical extinction and far - ir emission depends on the grain size distribution ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the diffuse gas , where our results apply , is thought to have reasonably uniform dust properties , with values of @xmath21 . since neither the burstein - heiles nor our assumptions are true for all environments , a comparison between the different methods is of interest .    to calibrate the extinction curve",
    ", we extensively explored the anticorrelation of counts - in - cells of the apm galaxy survey ( maddox et al .",
    "1990b , 1990c ) with @xmath0 emission , finding a consistent calibration in different directions of the sky . due to complications in translating this calibration into @xmath22",
    ", we shall defer this discussion for a separate paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "since we find that the @xmath0 maps are well correlated with hi  emission at high latitudes , we do not not expect the new extinction maps to grossly deviate from the burstein - heiles reddening estimates when averaged to the same scales .",
    "but many dusty regions have filamentary structure with large fluctuations in extinction estimates over angular scales much smaller than the resolution of the bh maps . furthermore , at low galactic latitudes , regions such as orion and ophiuchus might be saturated in hi  emission , or partially ionized , whereas the dust remains optically thin .",
    "another important application for maps of the diffuse emission is to compare with cmbr fluctuation maps .",
    "recent analyses of the cobe / dmr fluctuations ( @xcite ) show a positive correlation with dirbe maps , particularly in the north polar spur region .",
    "similar correlations are seen between the saskatoon cmbr maps and the iras maps ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is unexpected , since these @xmath23 cmbr experiments are not sensitive to dust emission , but are sensitive to free - free emission from the warm ionized medium ( wim ) .",
    "this implies that the wim is at least partly correlated with the cold , dusty medium , and that our dust maps could be used as a model for both components ( @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , the observed cmbr correlations might be explained by small spinning dust grains producing continuum emission in the @xmath24 range ( @xcite ) , in which case the dust maps should correlate extremely well with cmbr observations over the entire sky .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ section_column ] describes the processing of the dirbe data .",
    "we describe how the weekly averaged dirbe maps are trimmed and then reconstituted into annual average maps more suitable for our simple treatment of the zodiacal light removal .",
    "we fit a zodiacal light model by maximizing the correlation between the dirbe maps and hi  in regions of high galactic latitude and low flux .",
    "the diffuse cirrus emission is expected to have a reasonably uniform temperature since the ultraviolet radiation field which is heating the dust must be a smooth function of angular position except within dense clouds . fortunately , the emission at @xmath25 and @xmath1 is expected to be dominated by grains sufficiently large to be in equilibrium with the radiation field ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) , so that the @xmath26 color ratio can provide a useful measure of grain temperature . in section [ section_tempmap ] ,",
    "we describe how we measure the temperature in the presence of substantial noise in the @xmath1 map .",
    "this information is used to translate the @xmath0 emission to dust column density .",
    "the inclusion of the iras data is discussed in section [ section_iras ] . before we can combine the iras / issa map with the dirbe map , we must first deal with the issa boundaries and discontinuities .",
    "the issa maps are destriped versions of the original iras scans , but further destriping is possible and essential for high angular - resolution studies .",
    "we use a matched set of window functions that low - pass filter the dirbe map to @xmath27 resolution and high - pass filter iras / issa maps on the same scale .",
    "the combined map is then simply the sum of these two filtered maps .",
    "section [ section_sources ] details the removal of extragalactic objects and point sources from the maps , leaving behind only a map of the dust emission .    in section [ section_calibrate ] , we present a simple procedure for normalizing the reddening per unit flux density of dust emission .",
    "we correlate the residual of the @xmath12 vs.  @xmath13 index for 384 elliptical galaxies against the estimated reddening , and adjust the normalization until the slope of the relation is zero .",
    "the resulting calibration has an uncertainty of only @xmath28 .",
    "we also show that the maps have an accuracy of @xmath29 in predicting reddening , which is twice as good as the older bh procedure .    a summary of all these reprocessing procedures in presented in section [ section_psummary ] .",
    "readers uninterested in the details of the analysis should skip directly to this point .",
    "general discussion and conclusions are presented in sections [ section_discussion ] and [ section_conclude ] .",
    "appendix [ section_contam ] discusses the contamination level of stars that remain in the maps .",
    "appendix [ section_filters ] describes how to relate the reddenings and extinction in different optical and infrared filters .",
    "section_files ] describes how to access the final maps .",
    "the dirbe data set is in the public domain and was obtained from the national space science data center ( @xcite ) on cdrom . for a complete description of the dirbe instrument , see boggess et al .",
    "both annual average skymaps and maps averaged over each week of the mission are provided .",
    "the data are binned to @xmath30 @xmath31 pixels on the cobe quadrilateralized spherical cube .",
    "( for a description of this `` skycube '' projection , see @xcite . )",
    "as described below , we create new annual average @xmath5 and @xmath0 skymaps from the 41 weekly maps in skycube format in which the weighting function of each week is forced to be the same for both channels .",
    "we then reproject the data to standard , equal - area , polar projections oversampled to 512 pixels from @xmath32 to @xmath33 ( @xmath34 square degrees / pixel ) . in order to preserve total flux to a good approximation , we initially projected to a lambert ( polar ) mapping with @xmath35 smaller pixels which were then binned to the @xmath34 square - degree resolution .",
    "( note that the surface brightness of the cirrus is preserved in this re - projection . ) these maps for each passband , @xmath36 , are denoted by @xmath37 , and are in units of @xmath38 .",
    "we use the @xmath5 map as a model of the zodiacal light , and the @xmath0 and @xmath1 maps for measuring the temperature and column density of the dust .",
    "the dirbe maps are severely contaminated by zodiacal emission from dust in the solar system , otherwise known as the ipd ( inter - planetary dust ) .",
    "the ipd primarily re - radiates thermally at @xmath39 in the infrared ( for @xmath40 emissivity ) .",
    "its emission per unit column density is substantially higher than that of @xmath41 galactic dust : using an @xmath42 emissivity law , the @xmath0 emission of the ipd is larger by a factor @xmath43 than that of galactic dust for an equivalent column density .",
    "the brightest zodiacal emission is in the ecliptic plane , at the level of @xmath44 .",
    "based upon our solutions , this corresponds to an extinction at the negligible level of @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the removal of zodiacal light emission is critical as it makes no measurable contribution to optical extinction .    the @xmath5 maps , where the ipd emission peaks , is used to model the ipd contamination at the longer wavelengths .",
    "before removing this contamination , the dirbe annual average data must first be regenerated so that the data at all wavelengths are sampled at the same time and through the same ipd .",
    "the zero - points of the zodiacal contamination are constrained by hi  maps at high galactic latitude .",
    "removal of the zodiacal light is a difficult problem .",
    "the observing strategy of the cobe satellite resulted in a lower signal - to - noise ratio in the ecliptic plane where the zodiacal light is most prominent .",
    "the number of high - quality dirbe observations per pixel ranged from @xmath46 at the ecliptic equator to @xmath47 near the ecliptic poles .",
    "the least - sampled regions were approximately cones of @xmath48 opening angle centered at ecliptic @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "the dirbe maps exhibit a striping pattern perpendicular to the ecliptic plane ; scans adjacent in the sky correspond to temporally separated instrument tracks , taken at varying solar elongation angles , through different column densities of ipd .",
    "measurements for each week of the mission were used to construct weekly skymaps .",
    "the dirbe annual average skymaps are a combination of the weekly maps , averaged by the number of times that each pixel was observed in a weekly map .",
    "unfortunately , the whole sky is not scanned each week , and some parts of the scanned region are omitted in certain weeks due to interference from the moon and planets . furthermore , not all the detectors were on at all times .",
    "a cursory glance at the weekly skymaps reveals a serious problem with combining data in this way . near the ecliptic plane ,",
    "the @xmath5 flux exhibits a strong dependence on solar elongation angle , @xmath51 . during the 41 weeks",
    ", data were typically taken between @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and the @xmath5 flux varies by a factor of two over this range .",
    "comparison with the @xmath0 ipd flux also reveals a strong temperature gradient with respect to @xmath51 .",
    "this is easily explained by assuming a radial gradient of ipd density from the sun , because a line of sight passing close to the sun must traverse more ( and hotter ) dust than a line of sight at larger solar elongation . as a further complication , because the 10 passbands were not always observed simultaneously , the weekly skymaps of the weighting function do not always match across all channels .",
    "contributions to the annual average skymaps were weighted according to the number of observations made in each channel , in spite of the strong dependence on elongation angle .    in cases where the measurement noise is overwhelmed by the time",
    "- dependent systematic variations , this method of averaging is inappropriate",
    ". the weights assigned to sky pixels are thus not always the same for the @xmath5 and @xmath0 weekly maps , leading to weighted annual average skymaps which can not be directly compared to each other .",
    "to rectify this , we recombine the 41 weekly skymaps using the same weight for the same pixels in different passbands .",
    "we use the error maps for the @xmath0 passband as weights in all other passbands . because the ipd temperature gradient is strongest at low @xmath51",
    ", we further delete all data in each weekly map taken at @xmath54 .",
    "the resulting maps have noise and artifacts which are somewhat worse than the annual average skymaps from the nssdc ; however , the artifacts are the same at both wavelengths .",
    "the resulting @xmath5 map is appropriate for modelling the ipd contamination at other wavelengths .",
    "the spatial - temporal variations of zodiacal light are complicated and difficult to model analytically .",
    "our procedure for removing the zodiacal light assumes that the @xmath0 map correlates linearly with hi  at high galactic latitudes and low flux levels ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that one should also expect some dust within the extensive ionized @xmath55 zones , and that the column density ratio @xmath56 has considerable scatter in different directions ( @xcite ) .",
    "the relationship between the diffuse ionized and neutral hydrogen in any direction is complex ( @xcite ) ; some of the @xmath55 is associated with neutral gas , while other ionized clouds adjoin neutral regions .",
    "we are of course interested in measuring the dust associated with both components , and to the degree that there is dust within @xmath55 regions not associated with neutral regions , the scatter of dust and hi  will be increased .",
    "the degree of scatter between neutral gas and dust is therefore of considerable interest , but this scatter should not bias our procedure .",
    "we consider the @xmath5 map as a template of the unwanted zodiacal foreground , as the @xmath5 channel is so thoroughly dominated by the ipd . in a few regions where the galactic cirrus contributes more than a few per cent to the @xmath5 emission , we interpolate the @xmath5 map in bins of constant ecliptic latitude .",
    "to first order , we subtract scaled versions of the @xmath5 map in order to minimize the scatter between the hi  and zodiacal - corrected @xmath0 and @xmath1 emission .",
    "we further refine this correction with the addition of a quadratic term to account for temperature variations in the ipd .",
    "fitting black - body functions to the zodiacal light from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , we find that the color temperature does not vary by more than ten percent from ecliptic equator to the poles .",
    "this allows us to make a first - order correction under the assumption that the ipd is at a constant temperature .",
    "the dirbe @xmath5 map , @xmath57 , is directly scaled to model the zodiacal contamination at longer wavelengths .",
    "the raw maps for these other dirbe passbands , @xmath37 , are corrected to * d*^l_b = * d*_b - a_b * d*_25 - b_b .",
    "the coefficient @xmath58 determines the scaling of the zodiacal emission from the @xmath5 dirbe passband to passband @xmath36 .",
    "the zero - point offset , @xmath59 , is used to account for a multitude of non - zodiacal contributions to the @xmath5 and @xmath0 maps , either from the galaxy or extragalactic light .",
    "although the @xmath5 map is relatively free of point sources , the ten brightest sources have been masked to their local averages ( see table [ table_dirbebadpix ] ) .",
    "note that these sources were not excluded from the @xmath0 or @xmath1 maps .",
    "assuming that hi  correlates linearly with dust at high latitudes and low flux levels , we make use of the hi  flux to determine the zodiacal flux scaling coefficients and zero - point offsets . we compare the emission , @xmath60 , to the hi  column density , @xmath61 , from the leiden - dwingeloo 21-cm survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 21-cm emission is summed in the velocity range @xmath62 , which samples almost all of the galactic hi  at high galactic latitudes .",
    "( at high latitudes , hi  outside of this range shows no correlation with the @xmath0 maps ) .",
    "we solve for the coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath59 of equation [ equ_zodycorr ] and the hi - to - dirbe ratio , @xmath63 , using a least - squares minimization of ^2 = _ i ^2 in each passband .",
    "the errors in this relation are systematic and difficult to express analytically .",
    "therefore , we take the uncertainties , @xmath64 , to be proportional to the hi  flux .",
    "the fitting procedure is performed on the maps binned to @xmath65 and limited to those areas of the sky with low emission , hi  @xmath66 , or @xmath67 ( @xmath68 of the sky ) . two dust clouds with unusual temperature and the region immediately around the very bright source",
    "ngc  253 are omitted from the fits .",
    "the results of these fits for @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath1 are presented in table [ table_zodycoeff ] , and a scatter diagram is shown in figure [ fig_hi100 ] both ( a ) before and ( b ) after the correction .",
    "temperature variations in the ipd make the linear correction of equation [ equ_zodycorr ] inadequate for our purposes .",
    "based on @xmath71 and @xmath72 ratios , the color temperature of the ipd varies by @xmath73 for an @xmath74 emissivity law or by @xmath28 for an @xmath42 emissivity law . because the @xmath0 band is on the rayleigh - jeans side of the spectrum , this results in a @xmath75 or @xmath28 error in zodiacal light .",
    "as the zodiacal light contributes up to @xmath76 at @xmath0 in the ecliptic plane , this results in absolute errors of @xmath77 , with a strong ecliptic latitude dependence .",
    "a constant temperature , linear model of zodiacal dust removal is a good first approximation , but is clearly too simplistic . because the neighboring passbands at @xmath19 and @xmath20 are a complex mix of zodiacal and non - zodiacal contributions , it is desirable to model the variation in ipd temperature using only the @xmath5 map rather than some linear combination of passbands .",
    "thus we are driven to higher order fits using only the @xmath5 map .",
    "the temperature variations in the ipd are most strongly a function of ecliptic latitude , @xmath78 .",
    "an adequate second - order function for modelling the variations in ipd emission at longer wavelengths is to include a term that is linear in the product of @xmath57 and @xmath79 , the mean @xmath5 emission at each ecliptic latitude ( limited to @xmath80 to minimize galactic contamination in the model ) . with a scaling coefficient , @xmath81",
    ", the corrected maps then become * d*^q_b = * d*_b - ( a_b + q_b |*d*_25 ( ) ) * d*_25 - b_b .",
    "the above is referred to as the quadratic correction .",
    "solutions are again found via equation [ equ_zodyfit ] using the same region of the sky as before .",
    "results are presented in table [ table_zodycoeff ] . since the linear and quadratic contributions",
    "are not orthogonal , there is no particular physical meaning to the coefficients derived in the quadratic fits ; they are merely the coefficients which yield the minimum @xmath82 .",
    "the result of the quadratic correction is shown in figure [ fig_hi100](c ) . at @xmath0 ,",
    "the quadratic correction is clearly superior to the linear correction , reducing the rms scatter from 19% to 16% ( for hi@xmath83 ) . at @xmath1 ,",
    "the difference between the two fits is negligible .",
    "this is both because the @xmath1 map has a higher inherent noise , and because the zodiacal light correction at such long wavelengths is smaller . even though there is no obvious difference in fitting methods at @xmath1",
    ", we apply the quadratic correction to both passbands to avoid introducing systematic errors into the determination of the dust temperature . using the bell laboratories hi  survey ( @xcite ) instead of leiden - dwingeloo results in a zero - point change in the final @xmath0 map of only @xmath84 , with a standard deviation of @xmath85 .    in principle",
    ", the fit should be done between the hi  gas and the total column density of dust .",
    "the total column is a complicated function of the @xmath25 and @xmath1 maps , and the zodiacal - light coefficients for both those maps need be fit simultaneously .",
    "this non - linear fit with six parameters is not stable , primarily because the dirbe @xmath1 signal - to - noise ratio is too low at high latitudes .",
    "for this reason , we have performed the fit independently for the @xmath25 and @xmath1 maps . as long as the temperature of the dust does not vary significantly and systematically with ecliptic latitude ,",
    "then the fit coefficients for our zodiacal model should be valid . as we discuss in the following section ,",
    "variations in the galactic dust temperature at the high latitudes used in these fits are hardly measurable above the noise .",
    "this least - squares minimization procedure is used only to remove the zodiacal foreground .",
    "our measure of the best removal is minimal scatter between the far - ir dust emission and 21-cm emission .",
    "there could well be an additional component of dust that is not correlated with the hi  emission , such as dust associated with diffuse @xmath55 regions .",
    "in such a situation , our procedure for zodiacal foreground removal should remain unbiased , but the interpretation of the fit coefficients would be different .",
    "the slope @xmath58 would signify the amount of dust associated with neutral gas mixed with ionized gas , while the offset @xmath59 would be the dust associated with instrumental offset , the cib , and dust emission associated with a uniform sphere of diffuse @xmath55 .",
    "this method of zodiacal light correction is by no means definitive . a more thorough examination of the problem is currently under way by reach and collaborators ( @xcite ) .",
    "they are performing a detailed modelling in three - dimensional space of the ipd that includes the dependence of dust temperature and density on the distance from the sun , as well as specific dust bands , and the inclination of the dust cloud with respect to the earth s orbit .",
    "however , our model is adequate for the present analysis . in the worst case , assuming that all of the residual scatter in the corrected @xmath0 plots at hi@xmath86 is due to imperfectly - subtracted zodiacal light , the rms of this error is @xmath87 .",
    "this corresponds to an error of @xmath88 in @xmath89 .      as a digression at this point",
    ", the question of the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) was a major motivating factor for the dirbe experiment .",
    "the extraction of the cib has proven to be a considerable challenge ( @xcite ) , and to date cib detections from dirbe data have been reported as upper limits .",
    "the regression analysis described above is one method to approach such a measurement , provided the zodiacal model is adequate .",
    "the coefficient @xmath90 of the regression fits is a constant term that remains after the zodiacal foreground dust and all galactic dust correlated with hi  emission is removed .",
    "this term is not likely to be an instrumental offset , since dirbe had a cold - load internal chopper and the entire telescope was cold .",
    "a significant detection of @xmath90 is either a measure of the cib or due to some unknown instrumental artifact .",
    "since the zodiacal dust is confined to a thin zone in the ecliptic plane of the solar system , along directions away from the ecliptic plane , all the zodiacal foreground is approximately 1 a.u . from the sun .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume the zodiacal foreground emission of our reconstructed yearly maps to be the same temperature in all directions , for sufficiently high @xmath91 .",
    "thus a linear model should be adequate for removal of the zodiacal emission .",
    "however , one can not look strictly at the ecliptic poles , since the @xmath5 maps vary only a factor of 3.5 from the ecliptic plane to the pole ; a suitable lever arm in @xmath78 is therefore essential to decouple the isotropic cib from the smoothly varying zodiacal foreground .",
    "we have performed linear regression analyses for the @xmath0 , @xmath7 , and @xmath1 maps as a function of the lower limit on ecliptic latitude , @xmath91 , using the procedures described in section [ section_zody ] .",
    "the results are listed in table [ table_cibr_coeff ] .",
    "the quoted errors represent the formal 95% confidence intervals , and do not incorporate systematic errors due to our choice of zodiacal model .",
    "for the zero - point term , @xmath90 , the quoted errors are dominated by covariance with the zodiacal coefficient , @xmath92 . at @xmath0 , we have no significant detection , largely because the zodiacal foreground is quite substantial . at @xmath7 and @xmath1 ,",
    "the determination of @xmath90 is significant and non - zero .",
    "these are possibly measurements of the cib , as we discuss in section [ section_cibr_discuss ] below .",
    "the main component of galactic dust detected by dirbe spans a color temperature range of @xmath2 to @xmath3 for an assumed @xmath93 emissivity ( @xcite ) . at the extremes of this temperature range ,",
    "the emission at @xmath0 will differ by a factor of @xmath75 for the same column density of dust .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to use temperature information to recover the dust column density .",
    "there are three useful dirbe bands for computing the galactic dust temperature , centered at @xmath0 , @xmath7 and @xmath1 .",
    "the median signal - to - noise ratio per pixel for these maps at @xmath94 is @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "because of the high @xmath98 at @xmath0 , we will use that map as a spatial template and multiply it by a temperature - correction factor derived from the @xmath0 to @xmath1 ratio .",
    "the @xmath7 map is not used because of its large noise level compared to the nearby @xmath0 map .",
    "we attempt no temperature correction in regions of very low emission , since our procedure will introduce noise and the exact temperature of the dust in these dilute regions is less important .",
    "estimation of the dust color temperature and column density is complicated by our lack of knowledge about dust opacities and temperature distributions .",
    "our procedure works only if the large grains responsible for the emission at @xmath25 to @xmath1 are in thermal equilibrium with the interstellar radiation field , and the smaller , transiently heated dust grains make a negligible contribution to emission at these wavelengths .",
    "fortunately , these assumptions appear to be in agreement with our current understanding of interstellar dust emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    because the ism is optically thin in the fir , the intensity @xmath99 is given by i_= , where @xmath100 is the grain temperature , @xmath101 is the mass density , @xmath102 is the planck function , @xmath103 is the opacity , and the integral is over the physical path length .",
    "since the dust particles are small ( radii @xmath104 ) compared to fir wavelengths , the opacity @xmath103 does not depend upon the details of the particle size distribution .",
    "however , the opacity does depend upon the nature of the material .",
    "in general , the opacity follows a power law in the fir , _ ^.",
    "the draine & lee ( 1984 ) model predicts that the fir emission is predominately from graphite with @xmath105 .",
    "layer - lattice materials , such as amorphous carbon , have opacities @xmath106 , and silicates have @xmath107 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath108 in deriving our dust temperatures .",
    "though this choice directly affects the temperature estimation , we show that our final dust column densities are completely insensitive to this choice .",
    "the reason for this insensitivity is that the dirbe passbands are sufficiently near the wien tail of the dust spectrum .",
    "`` classical '' grains with radii @xmath109 exposed to ambient starlight retain an equilibrium temperature . in the section that follows , we assume such an equilibrium and fit each line - of - sight with a single color temperature . however , each line - of - sight through the galaxy may pass through several regions at different equilibrium temperatures . by ignoring multiple temperature components",
    ", we systematically underestimate the true column density .",
    "we have modelled this effect by fitting a single color temperature to emission from @xmath110 dust added to emission from another region at temperature @xmath111 . for different choices of @xmath111 and its mass fraction , @xmath112",

    "the spirit of most filtering methods is to produce a map with a fairly uniform signal - to - noise ratio .",

    "fortunately , the scanning strategy of the iras satellite gives sufficient information to remove most of the striping artifacts that remain .",
    "cao et al .  (",
    "1996 ) have made important progress towards destriping the maps and deconvolving the iras beam reponse in small regions of the sky .",
    "however , due to the complexity of their algorithm and large amount of computing time required , it is impractical at this time to apply such a method to the full sky .",
    "we have developed an algorithm that is straightforward to implement and can easily be applied to the full sky .",
    "we consider each issa plate separately , and manipulate it in fourier space .",
    "one issa plate and its fourier transform are seen in figure [ plate_fourier](a ) and ( b ) , where zero wavenumber is at the center .",
    "the rays emanating from the center are a clear signature of the striping in real space .",
    "the problem then becomes one of removing this excess power in fourier space that is associated with the real - space stripes . because the iras satellite scanned most of the sky two or three times , usually at a different angle , the contamination in fourier space occurs at different wavenumbers for each scan",
    "thus , the contaminated wavenumbers from one scanning angle can be replaced with wavenumbers from the other scanning angles .",
    "the steps involved are ( 1 ) identifying the contaminated wavenumbers , and ( 2 ) an optimal replacement strategy which allows for the lack of full coverage for many of the scans .",
    "because the stripes are radial in fourier space , we parameterize the fourier domain in polar coordinates @xmath170 for the purposes of this discussion , although it is discretely sampled in @xmath171 and @xmath172 for calculations .    for each issa plate ,",
    "there are 3 hcons ( hours - confirmed scans ) referred to as hcon-1 , hcon-2 , and hcon-3 . the composite map generated from these",
    "is called hcon-0 , but when we refer to `` the hcons ''",
    "we mean hcons 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "many of these individual hcons contain data with striping in only one direction .",
    "in general , however , a single hcon image may contain data taken in multiple scan directions , and significant regions of missing data .",
    "in many cases , hcon-3 contains little or no data .",
    "for each hcon map there is a corresponding coverage map , which was used by ipac to compute a weighted average of the three hcons for each plate .",
    "( these coverage maps were kindly provided to us by s.  wheelock ) .",
    "the explanatory supplement also reports the use of a local destriper , but it appears to have had negligible effect in low - flux regions of the sky .      with each plate , we begin by generating a composite map from the three hcons , using the three coverage maps for weights .",
    "this is equivalent to the hcon-0 composite maps released with the issa , except that no local destriper has been applied , and asteroids and other artifacts have not been removed .",
    "because our method is based on fourier transforms where bright point sources may overwhelm many modes , we perform a crude point source removal before any analysis .",
    "this consists of selecting objects or regions which are more than @xmath173 above the median - filtered image .",
    "several tests of this method indicate that it masks all significant point sources but not the striping .",
    "these sources are then replaced with the median of an annulus around them . because these sources are only removed when identifying contaminated modes , the details of this process are unimportant .    this composite hcon-0 image ( without point sources )",
    "is smoothed with a @xmath174-fwhm gaussian to produce a baseline image which is used to fill in missing pixels in each of the three hcons .",
    "this smoothing is enough to suppress most of the striping , and the replacement of missing pixels allows us to fourier transform completely - filled , square images . before transforming ,",
    "we subtract the mean value from each image , apodize the edges , and embed the @xmath175 image in a @xmath176 array ( which is equivalent to demanding isolated boundary conditions ) . the transform for a typical plate",
    "is shown in figure [ plate_fourier](b ) .",
    "it is necessary to define a criterion with which to select the contaminated wavenumbers .",
    "we denote the fft of hcon-@xmath177 as @xmath178 and a particular element of @xmath179-space as @xmath180 .",
    "we bin the fourier domain into 90 azimuthal bins , each 2 degrees wide in @xmath181 . a background power as a function of @xmath181",
    "is determined by first finding the median at each @xmath182 , then median - filtering the result .",
    "we define a power ratio , @xmath183 , as the ratio of the power in each @xmath181 bin to the background power . by normalizing in this way",
    ", we expect @xmath183 to be near unity except in angular bins that are contaminated by stripes .",
    "we somewhat arbitrarily choose @xmath184 to be `` good '' power and @xmath185 to be `` bad . '' between these two cuts ,",
    "the information is deemed acceptable for retention , but poor enough to avoid replacing other `` bad '' power with it . in this way",
    ", `` good '' power is used where available , and we avoid corrupting real structures by not discarding power whose ratio is less than @xmath186 .",
    "each hcon is destriped separately before combining them to an averaged map .",
    "because of the incomplete coverage in some hcons , it would not be optimal to combine the images in fourier space . instead , for each hcon-@xmath177 , we create a stripe image , @xmath187 , which is removed in real space . in this way",
    ", we may utilize the good data in each hcon , even if only a fraction of the plate is covered .",
    "a composite of `` good '' power , @xmath188 , is generated by averaging all power at each @xmath189 with @xmath184 .",
    "any mode with no `` good '' power is set to zero .",
    "( modes with wavelengths larger than @xmath27 are not changed to avoid discreteness problems . )",
    "a bad pixel mask is produced for each hcon , indicating which regions of each @xmath178 are contaminated .",
    "the difference between @xmath178 and @xmath188 for bad modes only is inverse - transformed to obtain @xmath187 , the stripes corresponding to hcon-@xmath177 .",
    "this stripe map is subtracted from each raw hcon to produce individual , destriped hcons .",
    "note that only stripes have been removed , and the destriped images retain all of the original point sources and other real structures .",
    "these destriped images are then de - glitched ( following section ) and averaged , weighted by the coverage maps , to obtain the final hcon-4 images .",
    "figure [ fig_pkratio ] shows the one - dimensional power spectrum of four plates before and after the destriping process .",
    "the destriping has reduced the high spatial - frequency variance by nearly a factor of two in some high galactic - latitude areas . in cases where the point sources subtraction fails , nothing is done to the plate .",
    "this occurs only at low galactic latitude where the striping artifacts are overwhelmed by cirrus emission .",
    "we have not found stripes to be important for the generation of a reddening map in these areas , so we have done nothing about them .",
    "in addition to striping , the issa images contain other artifacts that must be removed .",
    "these anomalous features include transient sources , such as asteroids , and detector glitches that should have been removed from the time - ordered data stream .",
    "images with two or more hcons allow identification of these artifacts by looking for discrepant pixels .",

    "this post - production step removed anomalies from individual hcons before combining them to produce hcon-0 images .",
    "thus , hcon-0 differs from a coverage - map - weighted average of the hcons wherever anomalies were removed . rather than rely upon visual inspection , we implement an automated de - glitching algorithm .",
    "the first task is to identify discrepant points .",
    "we compare each destriped hcon to a local median , filtered on a @xmath190 scale .",
    "because some issa pixels have better coverage than others , they have lower noise .",
    "therefore , we set the threshold for a deviant pixel at @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is the number of times iras observed that pixel .",
    "the pixels which deviate from the median - filtered background by more than this threshold are flagged , as are their immediate neighbors .",

    "we measured the spearman rank correlation coefficient between extinction - corrected @xmath11 and @xmath22 . for calibration constants",
    "@xmath270 or @xmath271 , the chances that a random distribution would have a correlation as large as observed is less than 5% .",
    "thus , our 95% confidence limits for the normalization of the maps is @xmath272 . as confirmation of the procedure",
    ", we applied the same statistic to these galaxies using the bh reddening estimates : e(b - v)= q  e^bh .",

    "the bh reddening applied to the bcg galaxies leave no significant correlation between intrinsic @xmath11 and foreground reddening , indicating that the bh normalization ( @xmath275 ) is acceptable .",
    "a sharper test of the reddening calibration is possible by using an auxiliary correlate to reduce the variance of the intrinsic color distribution .",
    "for example , the @xmath13 index described by faber et al .",
    "( 1989 ) is expected to correlate closely with the intrinsic @xmath12 color for elliptical galaxies . for both increased metallicity and",
    "increased stellar population age , the line - strength increases and the colors become redder .",
    "use of the the @xmath13 index is ideal , since it is available for large samples and is not affected by reddening .",
    "we use the sample of 472 elliptical galaxies presented by faber et al . , which has very broad sky coverage , including many galaxies in rather dusty directions .",
    "of this sample , 389 galaxies have photoelectric colors in @xmath276 apertures , @xmath13-index measurements , and estimates of bh reddening .",
    "five of these galaxies are reported by d.  burstein to have suspect photometry and have been removed for our list ( ngc 83 , 545 , 708 , 1603 , and 7617 ) .",
    "the @xmath12 colors are listed in this catalog as being @xmath179-corrected and reddening - corrected in a manner that deviates slightly from bh reddenings given in the published full - sky bh map .",
    "in one region of the sky ( @xmath277 , @xmath278 ) it was determined that the bh map is not reliable and reddenings were assigned based upon deviations in the mg - color relation ( burstein et al .",
    "we have added the tabulated reddening corrections back to the colors to obtain the raw ( only @xmath179-corrected ) colors before proceeding with our analyses .",
    "we should note that the unreliable region lacks a dust - to - gas ratio estimate in the bh map construction .",
    "dave burstein kindly sent us an updated version of faber et al.s table 1 , in which the @xmath13 estimates have been improved .",
    "for these objects , we compute a linear regression of reddening - corrected @xmath12 against @xmath13 , with residuals @xmath279 .",

    "the published bh reddening estimates , there is no significant residual correlation between @xmath279 and the reddening estimate .",
    "our formal normalization of the bh map is @xmath280 , with the standard deviation in @xmath279 reduced from @xmath281 to @xmath282 .",

    "the standard deviation of @xmath279 is reduced to @xmath284 .",
    "a plot of @xmath12 residuals from the mg - color relation versus reddening is shown in figure [ fig_mgcolor ] , using both bh and dirbe / iras reddening estimates .",
    "a different symbol type is used for galaxies in the north ( dec@xmath285 ; squares ) versus the south ( dec@xmath286 ; crosses ) , as the bh maps do not utilize dust - to - gas information for the southern points .",
    "galaxies with no bh map values were not used in the fits , but are shown in the lower panel as asterisks . a slight trend in the residuals is evident for both bh and dirbe / iras corrections , in the sense that the highest reddening values appear to be overestimated . however",
    ", this trend is not statistically significant for the dirbe / iras corrections .",
    "note that the galaxies lacking bh estimates ( asterisks ) were not used in the fits , but still have reasonable color residuals using dirbe / iras reddening corrections .",
    "the larger size and reduced intrinsic - color scatter of the faber et al .",
    "sample leads to a much tighter constraint on @xmath265 , one which is consistent with the value derived from the bcg sample .",
    "the @xmath28 precision of the calibration is remarkably tight , and is consistent with early estimates of iras reddening calibrations from rowan - robinson et al .",
    "( however , we note that iras - only estimates of the reddening severely suffer from the poorly - constrained zero - point , zodiacal contamination , and un - accounted variations in the dust temperature . )",
    "the accuracy of the reddening maps can be estimated from the residuals in the mg - color relation .",
    "we assume that the errors in the reddening estimates , @xmath287 , are fractional , increasing with increasing reddenings such that _ d - i= f  e(b - v ) .",
    "we further assume that the intrinsic dispersion in the mg - color relation is @xmath288 ( including measurement errors ) , which is the measured dispersion for a sub - sample of galaxies in clean regions of the sky .",
    "a total error for the color of each galaxy is the quadrature sum of @xmath287 and @xmath289 . using this model for the errors",
    ", one can determine the accuracy of the reddenings by increasing @xmath290 until the @xmath82 of the fit equals the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "for the bh reddening maps , we find @xmath291 , and for the dirbe / iras reddening maps we find @xmath292 .",
    "this demonstrates that the dirbe / iras reddening estimates have an accuracy of @xmath29 , which is nearly a factor of two improvement over the bh estimates for this full - sky comparison . in regions of low reddening , @xmath293 , this data set indicates that dirbe / iras and bh reddening estimates may be equally good .",
    "the burstein & heiles reddening map appears to be more accurate in the northern sky ( @xmath294 ) , where where galaxy counts were used to model gas / dust variation . splitting the data into two subsamples",
    ", one finds @xmath295 for the @xmath296 galaxies at @xmath294 , and @xmath297 for the @xmath298 galaxies at @xmath299 .",

    "we find that the dust / gas ratio in this region is variable , but not unusual on average .",
    "comparing the bh map to leiden - dwingeloo 21-cm data in the south , we conclude that the bh map may be unreliable near their survey edges at @xmath302 . within the region identified by burstein et al .",
    ", we find a smaller region , bounded by @xmath303 $ ] , @xmath304 $ ] , which appears corrupted and too high in the bh map .",
    "we had originally attempted to use counts - in - cells of the apm galaxy survey ( maddox et al .  1990b , 1990c ) as a normalization of the dust map .",
    "extinction as measured by the dirbe / iras column - density maps can be calibrated by studying the statistical covariance between the apm and dirbe / iras dust maps : dusty regions have increased dust emission and diminished galaxy counts .",
    "however , we encountered a problem similar to that seen by heiles ( 1976 ) when he attempted to compare reddening measures to the counts of shane - wirtanen galaxies .",
    "using the apm counts , we find a normalization ( @xmath265 ) that is approximately twice that described above .",
    "the extra sensitivity of the galaxy counts to dust is almost certainly due to the catalog of galaxies being surface - brightness limited as well as magnitude limited ; increased foreground dust not only diminishes the total flux of the galaxy but diminishes the size of the isophotal aperture and increases the likelihood that the galaxy will be either classified as a star or not be counted at all .",
    "we shall provide details of this analysis in a separate paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have extensively processed the available far - ir data sets to generate a uniform - quality , column - density map of the dust that radiates from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . the major steps in the processing are summarized below :    1 .",
    "the annual average dirbe maps have been regenerated such that the same zodiacal dust column is observed at all wavelengths .",
    "data with solar elongation @xmath305 has been deleted .",
    "a zodiacal light model has been constructed from the dirbe @xmath5 map .",
    "the model parameters were constrained by forcing the dust to trace the gas ( as measured by the leiden - dwingeloo hi  survey ) at high galactic latitudes .",
    "3 .   striping artifacts in the iras / issa @xmath0 maps",
    "were removed using a fourier - space filtering algorithm .",
    "4 .   asteroids and non - gaussian noise was removed from the iras / issa maps using a de - glitching algorithm that compared multiple scans .",
    "the iras and dirbe @xmath0 maps were combined , preserving the dirbe zero - point and calibration .",
    "6 .   stars and galaxies were removed to a limiting flux of @xmath306 over most of the sky at @xmath166 , and parts of the sky at lower latitudes . 7 .",
    "the color temperature of the dust was derived from the dirbe @xmath0 and @xmath1 maps .",
    "a temperature - correction map is used to convert the @xmath0 cirrus map to a map proportional to dust column .",
    "the temperature - corrected dust map is calibrated to the reddening of external elliptical galaxies .",
    "the use of the @xmath12 vs.  @xmath13 correlation allows us to set the calibration constant to 10% precision .",
    "we have confirmation of the superiority of the new procedure by a test of the scatter of residual @xmath12 colors after regression against @xmath13 line - strength .",
    "the scatter of the regression is dominated by intrinsic scatter among the galaxies .",
    "we measure a reduction in the variance consistent with a fractional error in the reddening estimates of @xmath29 for the new maps versus @xmath307 for the bh estimates .",
    "the new data show a wealth of filamentary structure that extends to the smallest scale resolved by our maps . a representative slice of the sky is shown in figure [ plate_slice ] , where we present the bh image , the leiden - dwingeloo hi  image , the dust map with dirbe resolution , and the final dust map with iras resolution .",
    "this slice displays part of the polaris flare on the left and the delicate structure of the high - latitude draco molecular cloud complex ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , also known as mbm complex 26 ( @xcite ) , to the right of center .",
    "the small - scale structure in the plot is at the resolution limits of the iras data .",
    "higher resolution data would perhaps show even finer scale structure .",
    "the full - sky dust map is shown as figure [ plate_dustmap ] with a logarithmic stretch to emphasize the faint , high latitude features .",
    "the cirrus filaments arch across the galactic poles , and between these filaments there are several low - density holes .",
    "the lockman hole , the region of minimum flux in the hi  maps ( @xmath308 ; @xcite ) , is one such low density region , with a temperature - corrected flux of @xmath309 . the southern galactic sky contains regions with even lower dust emission , perhaps by a factor of two .",
    "the lowest column density holes are located at @xmath310 , and @xmath311 , with temperature - corrected fluxes of @xmath312 .",
    "unfortunately , no high - quality hi  data exists to verify that the lowest - density holes are also minima in hi  emission .",
    "a tabulation of dust properties for our low - density holes and the galactic poles appears in table [ table_holes ] .",
    "a large region of the southern galactic sky ( @xmath313 ) appears to have very low dust emission and should therefore have the least foreground contamination for cmbr studies or large - scale - structure analyses of redshift surveys .",
    "projects in the northern hemisphere , such as the sloan digital sky survey and the north galactic strip of the two degree field ( 2df ) survey , may be more compromised by galactic extinction . in particular , the north galactic strip of the 2df is significantly more dusty than their southern region .",
    "however , the corrections derived from the new dust maps should prove adequate for most analyses .    in figure [ fig_pkdust ]",
    ", we show the power spectra of intensity fluctuations of the dust map calculated separately in eight independent patches of sky at high galactic latitude . for each hemisphere , we have extracted four quadrants in galactic latitude bounded by @xmath314 .",
    "the power spectra of these high - latitude patches have no preferred scale , but are reasonably - well described as power laws with @xmath315 .",
    "the amplitude of the power is different in each patch , which is indicative of extreme phase - coherence in the cirrus structure of the galaxy . to assume that the fluctuations can be approximated as random phase power",
    "is a completely inadequate description of this infrared cirrus , and could lead to misleading estimates of galactic foregrounds in cmbr experiments .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig_hidust ] , the correlation between the dust and the hi  emission is remarkably tight for low flux levels , but has substantial scatter at higher flux levels . because the @xmath1 map is on the rayleigh - jeans portion of the dust emission curve , one might expect it to better correlate with the hi  than the @xmath0 map .",
    "we see the opposite effect : there is more scatter in the @xmath1 - hi  correlation .",
    "we attribute this partly to the considerably larger noise of the @xmath1 map . but some of this increased scatter is undoubtedly generated by cool molecular cloud regions , in which much of the hydrogen is in molecular form , and the @xmath0 is exponentially reduced because of the lower temperature , while the @xmath1 emission is suppressed only linearly with temperature .",
    "furthermore , the dust - hi  scatter is non - negligible even in the regions of low flux , where the gas is expected to be predominantly neutral .",
    "this scatter may indicate either fluctuations in the ionization fraction of the gas , extensive regions of @xmath55 , or variations in the dust - to - gas ratio within neutral zones .",
    "a ratio map of temperature - corrected dust to the leiden - dwingeloo himap is shown as figure [ plate_dust_gas ] .",
    "the leiden - dwingeloo map includes hi  gas from the full velocity range of the survey ( @xmath316 ) converted to dust column via the ratio @xmath317 found in table [ table_zodycoeff ] .",
    "note that there are fluctuations in the ratio which are spatially coherent , indicating they are not instrumental noise , but rather real features on the sky .",
    "most of the high - latitude sky is a neutral grey , while regions of high dust - to - gas ratio appear as white .",
    "the most prominent of these features at high latitudes must be diffuse interstellar molecular clouds as well as regions of saturated hiemission , such as orion ( @xmath318,@xmath319 ) and ophiuchus ( @xmath320 , @xmath321 ) .",
    "the polaris flare ( @xmath322 , @xmath323 ) is very conspicuous .",
    "comparison of figure [ plate_dust_gas ] to figure [ plate_tmap ] shows that these regions of high dust - to - gas ratio often coincide with the regions of lower temperature , which is as expected , since the regions are optically thick in the uv and therefore shielded from the full ionizing flux of the galaxy .",
    "although searches for co have failed to detect an abundance of molecular gas above the galactic disk ( e.g.  hartmann , magnani , & thaddeus 1997 ) , it is very likely that molecular hydrogen is very abundant in these cooler regions ( @xcite ) .",
    "regions of low dust - to - gas ratio appear as black .",
    "these regions are primarily distant , high - velocity hi  clouds in which the dust , if present , is not as well - illuminated by a uv radiation field , and is therefore too cold to emit at @xmath0 .",
    "the magellanic stream is partially present in the south , while numerous high - velocity clouds are very prominent at high latitude in the north .",
    "a general gradient of dust - to - gas ratio from galactic center to anti - center is perhaps present in the northern sky , but if present in the southern sky , the gradient is obscured by the orion nebula . even in the grey , high latitude regions ,",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio map is not uniform and exhibits fluctuations of @xmath324% amplitude that are coherent over scales of 10 degrees .",
    "these modulations might indicate real gas to dust variation or they may hint at some unresolved instrumental problems .",
    "for example , three parallel bands in the north are residuals of the imperfect zodiacal light removal , but their total modulation is only @xmath325 peak - to - trough .",
    "figure [ plate_bhdiff ] is a full - sky map of the dirbe / iras reddening estimate minus the bh estimate , for the region @xmath326 .",
    "recall that the bh maps are largely hi  maps , with the zero - point adjusted and with smooth variations in dust - to - gas ratio computed on the basis of galaxy counts . as expected , apart from an offset , the bh reddening maps are very close to the new reddening estimates over most high - latitude regions of the sky , rarely differing by more than @xmath327 ( aside from a global zero - point difference ) .",
    "but there are large systematic differences at low latitude and towards molecular clouds , such as orion and ophiuchus .",
    "these modulations largely reflect the direct differences in the dust - to - gas ratio maps ( figure [ plate_dust_gas ] ) .",
    "these coherent modifications of the reddening estimates are important for full - sky analyses of the galaxy distribution , particularly for studies of large - scale flow fields .",
    "the absolute zero - point of dust column density in the galaxy is both difficult to model from 21-cm or infrared emission , and difficult to measure directly from stellar colors . the zero - point of 21-cm maps",
    "are uncertain due to sidelobe contamination of the radio telescopes .",
    "furthermore , the 21-cm maps completely miss any dust associated with ionized hydrogen .",
    "although the dirbe instrument chopped against a cold load to insure a stable zero point , the zero point of the combined dirbe / iras dust maps are uncertain because of uncertain zodiacal contamination and a possible isotropic , extragalactic background .",
    "direct measure of the reddening is an equally difficult task .",
    "extragalactic sources can not be used because their intrinsic colors are not known .",
    "studies of galactic sources are limited to calibration of the dust column density between local and halo stars .",
    "such comparisons may suffer from selection effects , and do not sample galactic dust beyond a few hundred parsecs .",
    "the debate as to the reddening zero - point has traditionally focused on the values at the galactic poles .",
    "although we find the absolute minima in the dust column are not at the poles ( see table [ table_holes ] ) , most studies are near these two lines - of - sight .",
    "some authors have claimed that the galactic poles are essentially free of reddening , whereas others claim a reddening of order @xmath328 , corresponding to an extinction @xmath329 .",
    "this debate was reviewed by burstein & heiles in 1982 , and has yet to be resolved .",
    "several large studies have been conducted to measure the colors of a and f stars near the galactic poles .",
    "color excesses from @xmath330 photometry for these stars with well - known , intrinsic colors is used to measure @xmath331 reddening .",
    "most of these studies argue for @xmath332 .",
    "the data of hilditch , hill , & barnes ( 1983 ) yield an average @xmath333 for 34 stars at @xmath334 and more than @xmath335 above the plane . furthermore , the subset of these stars in the quadrant @xmath336 show @xmath337 .",
    "a similar northern hemisphere study by perry & johnston ( 1982 ) is used to argue for negligible reddening for stars within @xmath335 distance towards the ngp . in a companion study in the southern hemisphere ,",
    "perry & christodoulou ( 1996 ) find @xmath338 for 73 stars within @xmath339 of the sgp .",
    "a reanalysis of some of these data by teerikorpi ( 1990 ) argues these result are subject to statistical biases , suggesting that the average reddening reaches @xmath340 at @xmath341 above the galactic plane .",
    "our estimated reddening , averaged over @xmath342 in diameter , is @xmath343 at the ngp and @xmath344 at the sgp .",
    "this corresponds to a blue - band extinction of @xmath345 ( @xmath346 ) at the ngp ( sgp ) , using an @xmath269 extinction law .",
    "we believe that a nonzero reddening at the poles is compelling for several reasons .",
    "first of all , we observe both @xmath0 emission and hi  emission at the poles , not all of which could be scattered light or zodiacal emission since it is structured and not entirely smooth at either pole .",
    "the fact that a linear dust - to - hi  regression fits so well through all the low flux regions suggests that this is truly material in the ism .",
    "the gas has low velocity so it is certainly part of the milky way , and so therefore must be the dust . if the a and f star reddenings are not biased by selection effects , then this gas and dust must be more than several hundred parsecs above the galactic plane .",
    "it is theoretically unreasonable for the dust at high galactic latitude to have fully evaporated .",
    "although the dust at the poles might have been preferentially ablated by the shocks which formed the local bubble , such ablation would generally be expected to act oppositely to the coagulation that occurs in dense molecular regions .",
    "the grain size distribution should tip further toward smaller grains , thereby lowering the value of @xmath347 but not eliminating the small grains which dominate uv and optical extinction .",
    "for many analyses , a change in the zero - point of dust reddening is irrelevant .",
    "but for studies such as photometry of distant supernovae , such an effect is quite important , and its neglect will lead to a systematic errors in the inferred @xmath348 .",
    "this arises because the extinction is not grey , and more strongly affects the b- or v - band spectra of nearby sne than the r- or i - band spectra of distant sne .",
    "an offset is readily apparent between the dirbe / iras reddening maps and those of burstein & heiles .",
    "we measure a median difference of @xmath349 in @xmath22 between the maps at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath314 ) , in the sense that the bh maps are systematically lower . for the reasons stated above",
    ", we believe the dirbe / iras zero - point to be more reliable . if one were to shift the dirbe / iras maps down by @xmath349 , the lowest column - density holes would have unphysical , negative reddenings of @xmath350 .",
    "the search for the signature of an extragalactic background light ( ebl ) has a long history ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such a background is inevitable and can be estimated based upon a star formation history , and the corresponding injection of energy and metals into the interstellar medium at various epochs . the predicted ebl",
    "can be expressed as i_= 0.007 _ bc^2 ( z)(c/4)(1+z_f)^-1 , where @xmath351 is the present baryon density and @xmath352 is the overall metallicity produced at redshift @xmath353 ( @xcite ) . for @xmath354 and @xmath355 , this yields @xmath356 .",
    "a high background flux thus favors substantial metal production at low redshift .",
    "the emergent flux will appear either in the uv / visible / near - ir window if the star formation is not very dusty , or will appear in the @xmath357 window if the majority of the light in star forming regions is reprocessed by dust .    in the discussion of section [ section_cibr_fit ]",
    "above , we described our regression of the dust maps on the hi  data while removing the zodiacal foreground and a constant background term .",
    "table [ table_cibr_coeff ] lists the derived background coefficients , @xmath59 , in @xmath38 , as a function of the limiting ecliptic latitude cut @xmath91 .",
    "note from this table that the inferred @xmath59 values drop as the fits are extended to lower values of @xmath91 .",
    "this results from the inadequacy of the linear model for zodiacal foreground removal , especially for the @xmath0 data .",
    "but for fits with @xmath197 , the @xmath7 and @xmath1 fits stabilize and are significantly different from zero .",
    "the error bars are dominated by the large covariance between the measurement of @xmath59 and @xmath58 , which becomes very extreme at large @xmath91 cuts .",
    "the error bars listed are the 95% confidence intervals , not including systematic effects . from variations of these results with ecliptic latitude cuts , and from simulations with mock ipd maps",
    ", we estimate that systematic errors are comparable to the tabulated , formal errors : @xmath223 , @xmath358 , and @xmath359 at @xmath25 , @xmath70 , and @xmath1 , respectively .    based on these fits",
    ", we conclude that there does exist a well - quantified uniform background radiation at @xmath7 and @xmath1 .",
    "we prefer to use the coefficients derived from @xmath360 as the best compromise between an inadequate model at low @xmath91 and insufficient modelling leverage at high @xmath91 .",
    "our results are similar , although slightly higher , than those reported previously by boulanger et al.(1996 ) . the only significant difference between our procedure and that of boulanger et al .",
    "is that we fit all terms of the linear regression simultaneously . in perhaps more convenient units ,",
    "a surface brightness of @xmath361 translates to @xmath362 , @xmath363 , and @xmath364 at @xmath0 , @xmath7 , and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the derived fluxes from table [ table_cibr_coeff ] thus translate to an upper limit of @xmath365 at @xmath0 , and detected flux of @xmath6 at @xmath7 , and @xmath8 at @xmath1 , where we have included the estimated , systematic error .",
    "we suspect that this isotropic flux is either extragalactic or is some sort of foreground directly related to the dirbe telescope .",
    "no galactic source is likely to be isotropic .",
    "we detect no hint of a dust layer distributed like @xmath366 that is uncorrelated with the hi  distribution , as might be expected from a uniform disk of ionized gas .",
    "since these results derive from comparison to the hi  distribution , they are sensitive to unknown offsets in the hi - dust relation .",
    "we have assumed that the galactic hi - to - dust relationship has no zero offset , which leads us to more reddening than predicted by the bh maps .",
    "if we force our mean high latitude reddening to match the bh maps , then the inferred cib would _",
    "increase_.    a possible instrumental explanation for the strong signature at @xmath7 and @xmath1 is given by hauser ( 1996 ) .",
    "although the entire dirbe telescope was operated at @xmath367 , which should minimize radiation by the telescope mimicking an isotropic background , in these two channels there is a measurable radiative offset induced by jfets , operating at 70k , used to amplify the detector signals .",
    "uncertainty in the correction for this effect is estimated to be 5 ( 2 ) @xmath368 at 140 ( 240 ) @xmath369 ( @xcite ) , which is considerably less than the signal we measure .    presuming this flux is indeed a cosmic infrared background , the inferred value is somewhat above that expected from the integrated star formation and dust reprocessing history of high redshift galaxies , even if they are shrouded in dust ( @xcite ) .",
    "the measured background is four times larger than that expected based on an empirical summation of the observed luminosity density of galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the numbers we measure might be consistent with a strong burst of massive star formation in elliptical galaxies , if they are sufficiently dusty ( @xcite ) .",
    "puget et al .  ( 1996 ) report an isotropic background detection from analysis of cobe / firas data in the 400 - 1000@xmath369 region , and our background measurements appear to be on the high side of the extrapolation of their measurements .",
    "the ebl derived from the optical fluxes in the hubble deep field ( hdf ) , with modest extrapolation of the galaxy counts , is approximately @xmath370 ( @xcite ) , a factor of @xmath10 smaller than that reported here . after masking detected sources in the hdf , vogeley ( 1997 )",
    "has shown that the remaining ebl , unless it is truly uniform , has a surface brightness that is at most a small fraction of the integrated light of the discrete sources .",
    "these results , together with recent observations of the uv continuum slope at high @xmath371 ( @xcite ) , suggest that much early star formation was very dust - enshrouded , reprocessing most of the uv , optical and near - ir photons to the far - infrared .",
    "an integrated far - ir background flux of such a magnitude , if correct , is a very promising sign for high angular - resolution studies of the far - infrared .",
    "space missions such as first and iso , and ground - based submillimeter observations with scuba on the jcmt and with the mma will have a tremendous opportunity to resolve this background , or to demonstrate that it does not actually exist .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the cib is currently underway by the dirbe team ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . instead of our simple , empirical model of the zodiacal foreground",
    ", they have solved for a detailed three - dimensional model of the interplanetary dust .",
    "they provide a much more complete analysis of the separation of galactic emission from the infrared background , and their results will undoubtedly supersede the preliminary measurements reported here .",
    "we have constructed a full - sky map of the galactic dust based upon its far - infrared emission .",
    "the iras experiment provides high angular resolution at @xmath0 , whereas the dirbe experiment provides the absolute calibration necessary across several passbands to map the dust color temperature and convert @xmath0 emission to dust column density .",
    "point sources and extragalactic sources have been removed , leaving a map of the infrared cirrus .",
    "this dust map is normalized to @xmath22 reddening using the colors of background galaxies .",
    "the final maps have a resolution of @xmath210 , and are shown to predict reddening with an accuracy of @xmath29 .",
    "the new dust map leads to reddening estimates quite consistent with the burstein - heiles maps in most regions of the sky , with the new maps proving to be twice as reliable .",
    "these new maps are certainly to be preferred in regions of high extinction , where hi - based maps suffer from saturation of the 21-cm line or insensitivity to molecular hydrogen .",
    "further tests are encouraged to determine the accuracy of our predicted reddenings and extinction . in particular",
    ", the accuracy of the maps at @xmath259 has yet to be established .",
    "the maps will undoubtedly prove useful for analyses of current and future cmbr experiments , as well as a host of galactic structure studies .",
    "for example , it will be of interest to determine whether the temperature variations observed at high latitude are consistent with molecular line observations , and whether better constraints on the distance to the high latitude molecular clouds can be obtained .",
    "molecular line observations of several of the regions of low dust - to - hi  ratio ( i.e. , the high velocity clouds ) will give information on the metal abundance in these regions , which might lead to better constraints on their distance from the plane of the milky way .",
    "we show that the dust correlates very well with the available hi  maps over most of the sky .",
    "the ratio of dust - to - gas can be used to flag molecular clouds on one extreme , and high velocity hi  clouds on the other .",
    "we note that the lowest regions of dust emission occur in the southern galactic sky , in a region where there exist no high - quality hi  maps .",
    "the south galactic sky has less power in the dust , and should be preferred for cmbr experiments and large - scale galaxy surveys .",
    "we argue that burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) underestimate reddening by @xmath349 in @xmath22 .",
    "our predicted extinction at the galactic poles is @xmath372 ( north ) and @xmath373 ( south ) on @xmath342 scales .",
    "there do exist holes that have extinction as low as @xmath374 ; the most prominent of these are listed in table [ table_holes ] .",
    "we find the lowest - column - density dust holes are in the southern galactic sky , but it is not known if these are also the regions of lowest hi . if these selected regions are indeed low in hi , then they should become preferred directions for deep imaging and spectroscopy of extragalactic sources in the soft x - ray bands , where galactic extinction is a severe problem .    in the process of generating these maps and removing the zodiacal foreground ,",
    "we have detected what appears to be a significant far - ir background flux , approximately @xmath375 and @xmath376 in the @xmath7 and @xmath1 bands respectively .",
    "this flux is surprisingly high , higher than the integrated light seen in the hubble deep field .",
    "if our measurement is a detection of the cib and not some artifact associated with the dirbe telescope , this suggests that early star formation was heavily dust shrouded in most of the universe .",

    "<S> we present a full sky @xmath0 map that is a reprocessed composite of the cobe / dirbe and iras / issa maps , with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed . before using the issa maps , </S>",
    "<S> we remove the remaining artifacts from the iras scan pattern . using the dirbe @xmath0 and @xmath1 data , </S>",
    "<S> we have constructed a map of the dust temperature , so that the @xmath0 map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density . </S>",
    "<S> the dust temperature varies from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5 . </S>",
    "<S> the result of these manipulations is a map with dirbe - quality calibration and iras resolution . </S>",
    "<S> a wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all galactic latitudes . in high latitude regions , </S>",
    "<S> the dust map correlates well with maps of hi  emission , but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of hi  emission toward denser clouds and the formation of @xmath4 in molecular clouds . in contrast , high - velocity hi  clouds are deficient in dust emission , as expected .    to generate the full sky dust maps , we must first remove zodiacal light contamination as well as a possible cosmic infrared background ( cib ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is done via a regression analysis of the @xmath0 dirbe map against the leiden - dwingeloo map of hi  emission , with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the dirbe @xmath5 flux . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground . for the @xmath0 map no significant cib is detected . at longer wavelengths , where the zodiacal contamination is weaker </S>",
    "<S> , we detect the cib at surprisingly high flux levels of @xmath6 at @xmath7 , and @xmath8 at @xmath1 ( @xmath9 confidence ) . </S>",
    "<S> this integrated flux is @xmath10 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the hubble deep field .    </S>",
    "<S> the primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of galactic extinction . to calibrate our maps , </S>",
    "<S> we assume a standard reddening law , and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of @xmath0 emission . </S>",
    "<S> we find consistent calibration using the @xmath11 color distribution of a sample of 106 brightest cluster ellipticals , as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with @xmath12 and mg line - strength measurements . </S>",
    "<S> for the latter sample , we use the correlation of intrinsic @xmath12 versus @xmath13 index to greatly tighten the power of the test . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older burstein - heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening . </S>",
    "<S> the maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening . </S>",
    "<S> these dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cmbr experiments and for estimating soft x - ray absorption .    </S>",
