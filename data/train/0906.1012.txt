    "the position angle for the pa-@xmath2 isophotes ( from the s / n contours ) does not align with that of the velocity field , possibly indicating the presence of a warp or bar .",

    "hints of a merger are apparent from hst images , displaying irregular , clumpy light distribution and a potential faint companion to the south - west . yet",
    "the dynamics of this galaxy s central region show ordered rotation , with the @xmath10 peak corresponding with the galaxy s nucleus .",

    "we refer the reader to these papers for a full description of the routines , noting that the simulation code fully accounts for the characteristics of the osiris+lgsao system and has been shown to well represent actual ifs observations of high - redshift galaxies @xcite .",

    "however , this figure illustrates some of the difficulties of high - redshift lbg observations : resolution loss in the simulated s / n data causes scuvlg092600 to appear more face - on ; the simulated @xmath10-map of scuvlg092600 appears more disturbed as edge features dominate ; lower resolution blends the double core of scuvlg143417 into a single blob ; selecting velocities where",
    "s / n exceeds detectable limits gives the velocity map in scuvlg143417 a slightly more regular appearance ; surface brightness dimming hides the complex fainter structure in scuvlg210358 .",
    "we derive values for axis ratios , inclination , circular velocity , @xmath10 and v/@xmath10 from the high-@xmath9 simulated data ( shown in table 1 , alongside the observed low-@xmath9 results ) .",
    "the v/@xmath10 for high-@xmath9 simulations of scuvlg092600 , scuvlg143417 and scuvlg210358 are 1.0@xmath75 , 0.4@xmath76(no inclination correction ) , and 0.9@xmath77 , respectively . therefore in all the cases ,",

    "v/@xmath10 increases in the high-@xmath9 simulated case , while decreasing for the other two galaxies .",
    "we find that the high-@xmath9 simulations physically resemble and have similar , though slightly higher , v/@xmath10 values as @xmath212 lbgs , which have v/@xmath78 0.3@xmath40.7 @xcite .",
    "we are pioneering a new study of the dynamics and kinematics in local ( @xmath790.3 ) uv - selected galaxies that resemble lbgs in most physical properties .",
    "similar studies have yielded mixed results about lbg dynamics at high-@xmath9 , but our study of 3 low-@xmath9 scuvlgs shows that dispersion dominated kinematics is a viable scenario .",
    "although 2 of the 3 cases show some signs of smooth rotation , v/@xmath80 in these galaxies . since hst images show disturbed morphologies , nearby companions , and evidence of ongoing interactions ( tidal features , plumes , etc . ) , it is not surprising that velocity dispersions in these galaxies are so high .",

    "studying a subset of lbgs having the highest velocity fields , @xcite find that the majority exhibit smooth rotation , consistent with cosmological predictions of flattened disk - like galaxies @xcite , while a more comprehensive sample demonstrates larger contributions from both major mergers and high dispersion systems @xcite .",

    "@xcite fit their z@xmath31.5 lbg with a rotation model but can not exclude a merger scenario .",
    "@xcite argue for largely dispersion dominated kinematics in their sample of lbgs . analyzing ifs data for one massive lbg at @xmath213.2 , @xcite find evidence for dispersion dominated kinematics .    comparing our sample of lbg analogs to lbgs at high-@xmath9 , our results are more consistent with compact , kinematically disturbed systems ( _ i.e. _  similar to @xcite , and see discussion by @xcite ) rather than larger , more massive disks ( _ i.e. _  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "while our selection criteria for scuvlgs includes compactness of the uv - emitting region , hst images do reveal underlying low surface brightness , extended structure in two cases  scuvlg1434 and scuvlg2103 .",

    "@xcite investigate other mechanisms capable of causing high dispersions in high-@xmath9 star - forming galaxies .",
    "they find that gas accretion can not sustain the observed high dispersions .",
    "studying the relationship between velocity dispersion and emission line characteristics , they conclude intense star formation can account for high dispersions in these systems through a feedback cycle between turbulence in the interstellar medium ( ism ) and star formation . the proposed scenario may offer a plausible explanation for observed gas kinematics once galaxies reach a turbulent phase and associated starburst @xcite .",
    "we show that simulated high-@xmath9 data produces v/@xmath10 values somewhat different from actual values .",
