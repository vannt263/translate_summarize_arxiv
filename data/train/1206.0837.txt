    "conformational transitions of a polymer have been a subject of interest for many years  @xcite .",
    "the coil - globule transition of a homopolymer , also called the collapse transition , has been most widely studied .",
    "a polymer chain in a dilute solution is influenced by both hydrophobic interactions between the monomers and the excluded volume effect , which cancel each other at a special temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the polymer chain adopts expanded and compact conformations for @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , with @xmath3 being the temperature of coil - globule collapse transition .",
    "@xmath1 region of the polymer system can be mapped into a magnetic system where the number of components is formally set to zero , with the infinite chain length corresponding to the critical temperature , and it has nothing to do with the temperature @xmath4 of the polymer model . ]  @xcite .",
    "then @xmath3 is a tricritical point where both of the quadratic and the quartic terms in the corresponding field theory vanish  @xcite .",
    "the radius of gyration ( or the end - to - end distance ) @xmath5 of a polymer chain with @xmath6 monomers , near @xmath0 , is generally expressed by the scaling theory  @xcite , @xmath7 where the exponent @xmath8 represents the geometrical properties of a polymer at the tricritical point , and the exponent @xmath9 , called the _ crossover _ exponent  @xcite , measures how rapidly the system undergoes the transition as the temperature @xmath4 approaches the tricritical temperature @xmath10 .",
    "the reduced temperature is defined as @xmath11 , scaling as @xmath12 as @xmath13 .",
    "the scaling function @xmath14 behaves as follows  @xcite @xmath15 since the upper tricritical dimension is three  @xcite , the tricritical exponent can be obtained from the mean field theory as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , but the scaling form ( [ scaling ] ) is expected to have logarithmic corrections  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the coil - globule collapse transition which is of second order in three dimensions  @xcite , a first - order transition from liquid - like globule to a solid - like phase is expected at a temperature lower than @xmath10  @xcite , which has been the subject of active research recently but less well understood than the coil - globule collapse transition .    in this work , we enumerate the number of all possible conformations on a simple - cubic lattice up to chain length 24 . in particular ,",
    "we study the zeros of the exact partition function , which are much more sensitive indicators of phase transition than the real - valued quantities such as specific heat .",
    "we observe that for chain length longer than 16 there are two distinct loci of zeros , suggesting the existence of both the coil - globule collapse transition and liquid - solid melting - freezing transition .",
    "the exact partition function zeros of three - dimensional lattice polymer have been studied for simple  @xcite and face - centered  @xcite cubic lattices for chain lengths up to 13 and 10 , respectively , but these lengths were too short to reveal two distinct loci , and the results for longer chains up to 31  @xcite were based on monte carlo sampling with limited accuracy .",
    "although the chains whose conformations are exhaustively enumerated in this work are still much shorter than those studied with monte carlo samplings , the exactness of the calculation enables us to extrapolate the finite @xmath6 data to obtain the result in the limit of infinite chain length with a reasonable accuracy .",
    "the chains were still too short to extract the large @xmath6 behavior of the inner locus corresponding to the melting - freezing transition , but the tricritical collapse temperature @xmath10 could be obtained from the scaling behavior of the outer locus . the form of the logarithmic correction to the scaling of the partition function zeros could also be obtained .",
    "additional analysis was performed on the exact specific heat , which shows the first - order - like pseudo - transition near the inner locus , in accordance with the previous result based on a chain - growth sampling  @xcite .",
    "conformations of a polymer chain with @xmath6 monomers are modelled by self - avoiding walks with @xmath18 steps on a simple - cubic lattice .",
    "the position of a monomer @xmath19 is expressed as @xmath20 with integer values of the coordinates @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the coordinates satisfy the constraints @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath26 due to the chain connectivity and the excluded volume effect .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian with the nearest - neighbor interaction : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is set to a positive value to incorporate the attractive interaction between the monomers .    assuming that the polymer chain has an intrinsic direction , the conformations with reverse labels @xmath30 for all @xmath31 are considered distinct . for a generic conformation ,",
    "the rigid rotations and reflections form an 48-fold symmetries in three dimensions .",
    "exceptions are the cases of lower - dimensional conformations embedded in higher dimensional spaces . in three dimensions , 24-fold and 6-fold symmetries",
    "exist for the planar and linear conformations , since they are invariant under transformation perpendicular to the underlying plane and straight line",
    ". therefore reduced numbers of conformations , where conformations related by symmetry are counted only once , are computed in order to prevent the waste of computational resources  @xcite .",
    "since the energy ( [ modelh ] ) depends only on the number of inter - monomer contacts @xmath32 , we classify the conformations according to the value of @xmath32 .",
    "the number of conformations @xmath33 for a given contact @xmath32 in @xmath34 dimensions , with discrete rotations and reflections considered distinct , is obtained from the reduced number of conformations @xmath35 as  @xcite @xmath36 from here on , we drop the dimension index and use @xmath37 to denote @xmath38 .",
    "the number of conformations @xmath37 for @xmath39 is presented in table  [ table : one ] .",
    "partition function zeros have been the subject of interest as a sensitive indicator of a phase transition  @xcite .",
    "partition function zeros were introduced by yang and lee in the complex fugacity plane of a fluid system and the complex magnetic - field plane of the nearest - neighbor ising ferromagnet ( yang - lee zeros ) , to study the phase transition driven by the fugacity or the magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "later , fisher  @xcite used the partition function zeros in the complex temperature plane ( fisher zeros ) of the square - lattice ising model , to study the temperature driven transition . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the locus of zeros forms a continuous curve which crosses the real axis if a transition exists .",
    "thus , the theory of partition function zeros provides the explanation on how the partition function , which is an analytic function of thermodynamic parameters at a finite size , acquires the singularities necessary for a phase transition in the thermodynamic limit . in the case of fisher zeros , the transition temperature in the thermodynamic limit",
    "is the intersection point of the locus of zeros with the real temperature axis .",
    "therefore , the conjugate pair of zeros closest to the positive real axis , called the _ first zeros _ , determine the leading singular behavior of the partition function . since the behavior of the first zeros can be analyzed separately from the other zeros , the phase transition can be analyzed more accurately by computing the partition function zeros than studying real - valued quantities such as the specific heat which includes the effect from all the zeros .    in the case of the lattice polymer of our interest , the partition function is written in terms of @xmath37 as @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes a sum over all possible conformations , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 which ranges between 0 and 1 for positive @xmath4 ; @xmath44 when @xmath45 and @xmath46 when @xmath47 . since the maximum number of contacts @xmath48 is finite for a given chain length @xmath6 , @xmath49 is a polynomial of order @xmath48 in @xmath50 .",
    "therefore the partition function zeros in the complex @xmath50 plane can be obtained by solving the polynomial equation @xmath51 with mathematica .",
    "figure  [ zeros ] shows the partition function zeros in the complex temperature plane for several values of chain lengths .",
    "the result for @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "[ zeros](a ) ) agrees with the previous result obtained by finsy _",
    "_  @xcite by exact enumeration after a change of variable , but the chain length is too short to reveal two distinct loci of zeros .",
    "the partition function zeros for @xmath53 were studied in the same reference by monte carlo sampling , but again two distinct loci were not visible .",
    "one of the reasons is that the zeros in the complex temperature plane of @xmath54 were investigated there instead of @xmath55 as in the current work . in the former case , the temperature range of interest",
    "@xmath56 corresponds to the real line with @xmath57 , with @xmath45 corresponding to @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , features relevant to low temperature behavior of the system may be easily missed if only a finite region near origin is considered .",
    "in contrast , @xmath56 corresponds to the segment @xmath59 in the @xmath50 plane , and consequently all of the physical regions can be examined with ease .",
    "the exact zeros plotted in the @xmath50 plane clearly exhibit the splitting of the locus into two distinct branches already for @xmath60 ( fig .",
    "[ zeros](b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "since there are two visually distinct loci of zeros , we will select the first zeros for each locus and analyze them separately in the following sections .",
    "the first zeros of the outer locus approach the real axis suggesting a non - trivial transition in the thermodynamic limit ( fig .",
    "[ nre](a ) ( open circles ) ) . from the scaling of the partition function",
    "whose form is similar to ( [ scaling ] ) , the first zeros @xmath61 are expected to scale as  @xcite : @xmath62 where @xmath63 . in three dimensions corresponding to the upper tricritical dimension , the scaling form ( [ scaling ] )",
    "is modified by logarithmic corrections  @xcite , and consequently ( [ ycfull ] ) is expected to be modified to be of the form @xmath64 the power of logarithmic correction @xmath65 can be estimated from the imaginary part of ( [ yclog ] ) : @xmath66 \\sim n^{-\\phi } ( \\log n)^{-\\lambda } , \\label{ycim}\\ ] ] which is rewritten as @xmath67 n^{\\phi } \\sim ( \\log n)^{-\\lambda}. \\label{ycim2}\\ ] ] taking the logarithm , we get @xmath68 n^{\\phi } ) \\simeq - \\lambda \\log \\log",

    "we applied bulirsch - stoer ( bst ) method  @xcite for the data of even @xmath6 with @xmath73 to estimate the value in the limit @xmath74 .",
    "we obtained @xmath75 where the error is estimated by examining the robustness of the extrapolated value with respect to perturbations of the data points  @xcite .",
    "the data points are chosen to maximize this robustness .",
    "the estimated value ( [ lamest ] ) exhibits remarkable agreement with @xmath76 appearing in the scaling of the boyle temperature @xmath77 where the second virial coefficient vanishes  @xcite : @xmath78 we then estimate the collapse temperature @xmath10 by taking the real parts of the scaling relations ( [ ycfull ] ) or ( [ yclog ] ) . applying the bst extrapolation for the data of even @xmath6 with @xmath79 , the collapse temperature is obtained as @xmath80 without the logarithmic correction , and @xmath81 with the correction factor of @xmath82(fig .  [ nre](b ) ) .",
    "as shown in table  [ table : two ] , the agreement with previous results is better when the logarithmic correction is included .",
    "it is to be noted that although the maximum length of chain 24 considered here is much less than those in monte carlo studies which is as long as 32000  @xcite , the exactness of our data enables us to perform extrapolation to large @xmath6 with reasonable accuracy .",
    "we also note that the intersection of the locus of zeros with the real axis is estimated to be at a temperature higher than @xmath83 obtained by fitting the monte carlo data of partition function zeros to a polynomial curve  @xcite .",
    "it was conjectured in the same reference that the corresponding transition is of first - order , which was later conjectured to be a low temperature melting - freezing transition  @xcite . however , we found no evidence that the transition is of the first order . since there is a separate inner locus corresponding to a transition at a lower temperature , and the intersection of the outer locus with the real axis in the thermodynamic limit",
    "is now estimated to be at 3.76 rather than 1.81 , the outer locus seems to be the one corresponding to the coil - globule collapse transition , which is well established to be a second - order transition  @xcite .",
    "the scaling of inner locus is much worse than that of the outer locus in this range of chain lengths .",
    "the distribution of the first zeros for various chain lengths is rather irregular ( fig .",
    "[ nre](a ) ) , and the real part shows oscillatory behavior as a function of @xmath84 ( fig .  [ nre](b ) ) .",
    "therefore no reasonable estimate of the transition temperature in the thermodynamics limit could be made .",
    "this irregular behavior of the melting - freezing transition point is also in agreement with the previous result obtained by computing the specific heat with chain - growth sampling for @xmath6 up to 125  @xcite .",
    "this irregularity is understandable , as explained in the same reference .",
    "the effect of melting - freezing transition which is expected to survive in the limit of large @xmath6 limit , and that of the excitation pseudo - transition which appears only near a special value of @xmath6 called magic numbers , are intermixed to give a rather complex behavior .    to complement the result from the partition function zeros , we performed additional analyses by computing the exact specific heat per monomer , @xmath85 which is plotted in fig .  [ specific](a ) as a function of @xmath50 for several values of @xmath6 .",
    "the effect of the melting - freezing and excitation transitions are mixed to manifest themselves as one prominent peak . in accordance with the previous result from a chain growth sampling  @xcite",
    ", we find that due to the effect of the excitation transition at the magic numbers @xmath86 satisfying @xmath87 or @xmath88 , the peak becomes sharper as @xmath6 is increased from @xmath89 to @xmath90 and becomes flat again at @xmath91 ( fig .  [ specific](a ) ) .",
    "as to be expected , the positions and the values of the peak exhibit irregular behavior as functions of the chain length ( fig .",
    "[ specific](b ) ) , similar to the result from the chain growth sampling  @xcite .",
    "the peak positions are in the range @xmath92 , much lower than the coil - globule collapse transition temperature @xmath93 obtained from the analysis of the outer locus of the partition function zeros , but much closer to the inner locus of zeros , whose real values are distributed mostly in the range @xmath94 ( fig .",
    "[ nre](a ) ) .    in the microcanonical formalism ,",
    "the first - order phase transition is signaled by the existence of a region of energy with @xmath95 where @xmath96 . ] , which is invisible in the canonical formalism  @xcite .",
    "for the system with discrete values of energy , this condition translates into the condition that there exists @xmath19 with @xmath97 where @xmath19 labels the energy values in the ascending order .",
    "these conditions are equivalent to the existence of @xmath98 near the transition temperature such that @xmath99 has at least two peaks corresponding to distinct phases .",
    "we see that the chains with @xmath60 as well as even value of @xmath100 satisfy these properties .",
    "we plot the two peaks of @xmath101 in fig .",
    "[ peaksfig ] for the largest magic number ( @xmath102 ) and the largest number ( @xmath39 ) among the chain lengths we studied , where the values of @xmath98 were adjusted for each chain so that the heights of the peaks are the same .",
    "these features clearly shows the first - order - like nature of the pseudo - transition , and are also consistent with similar results from the chain - growth sampling  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to melting - freezing and excitation transition , the effect of the coil - globule collapse transition is not readily visible in the specific heat ( fig .  [ specific ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the collapse transition is of the second order , where the specific heat is continuous and only its derivative is discontinuous or divergent .",
    "we studied conformational transitions of a polymer by exhaustively enumerating the number of all possible self - avoiding walks on a simple - cubic lattice up to chain length 24 .",
    "although the lengths of the chain are much smaller than those studied by monte carlo samplings , the strength of our result is that they are obtained from exact enumeration and hence contain no errors , enabling us to make extrapolation to infinite chain length with a reasonable accuracy .",
    "furthermore , by studying partition function zeros in the complex temperature plane , we could obtain information which is not readily available in the real - valued quantities such as specific heat .",
    "we observed two distinct loci of partition function zeros in the complex temperature plane , suggesting the existence of coil - globule collapse transition and liquid - solid melting - freezing transition .    from the finite - size scaling of the first zeros of the outer locus with mean field crossover exponent @xmath16 , the scaling form of the first zero with logarithmic correction factor was conjectured to be @xmath103 as in the case of the scaling of the boyle temperature .",
    "the collapse transition temperature was estimated to be @xmath104 and @xmath105 with and without logarithmic correction , respectively .",
    "the result shows better agreement with previous results in the presence of the logarithmic correction , suggesting that the conjectured form of the logarithmic correction to the scaling of the first zeros is indeed correct .",
    "the results for the collapse transition indicate an additional advantage of studying the partition function zeros .",
    "being a second - order transition where the specific heat is finite and continuous , the signal for the transition can not be easily detected by examining the peak of the specific heat ( fig .",
    "[ specific](a ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "since the partition function zeros is due to the singularities of the partition function regardless of the order of the transition , the signal for the transition is clearly visible as a locus of zeros approaching the real axis as the chain length increases ( fig .",
    "[ zeros ] and [ nre ] ) , making them an indispensable tool for studying phase transitions .",
    "the behavior of the inner locus was not regular enough for the current chain lengths to estimate the melting - freezing temperature in the limit of infinite chain lengths , due to mixture of the effect from the finite - size excitation pseudo - transition .",
    "the existence of the energy region with the negative value of microcanonical specific heat , which manifests itself as double peaks in the density of states multiplied by boltzmann factor near transition temperature , shows a clear sign of first - order - like nature of the pseudo - transition .",
    "the excitation transition is analogous to the folding transition of hp protein , which appears only for a particular sequence  @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to compare the transition behaviors of designable proteins , random heteropolymers and homopolymers , all on the same lattice .",
    "it is to be noted that although partition function zeros can be used to investigate the existence and the property of the phase transition , the information on the nature of the phases themselves can not be obtained .",
    "various geometric parameters of conformations contributing the phases of interest should be analyzed in order to confirm that the transitions we observe are indeed the coil - globule collapse and solid - liquid melting - freezing transitions .",
