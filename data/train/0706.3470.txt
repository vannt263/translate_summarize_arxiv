    "laser - based quantum control techniques can be loosely characterized by two general control ideologies : scenarios based in a time - domain perspective , such as pump - dump @xcite control , and scenarios based in the energy domain such as multi - path interference @xcite and stirap @xcite control .",
    "the quantum control of reactive scattering also fits these paradigms , where examples of multi - path interference ( energy - domain ) @xcite and wave packet ( time - domain ) @xcite schemes for coherently controlled chemical reactivity can be found . in this article , the coherent control of attosecond electron recollision dissociation is studied using both pump - dump and multi - slit interference schemes , and we find that this process offers the first experimental demonstration of wave - packet coherent control of reactive scattering @xcite .",
    "the recollision experiment that is the focus of this paper proceeds as follows .",
    "using femtosecond lasers of intensities around @xmath2 w/@xmath3 , one ionizes an atom or molecule near a peak of the instantaneous electric field , accelerating the liberated electron in the laser field , and causing the electron to recollide with the parent ion @xcite .",
    "the ionization / recollision process occurs in less than one cycle of the laser field , and repeats every cycle when the peak electric field is large enough to cause significant ionization . for ti : sapphire laser systems ( 800 nm ) typical of recollision experiments , one optical period is 2.6 fs and the recollision of the continuum electron wave packet with the core lasts about 500 asec . a number of processes can occur upon recollision .",
    "the continuum electron can , for example , recombine with the ion while emitting its excess energy as a burst of xuv radiation @xcite , or scatter elastically thereby taking a sub - femtosecond electron diffraction image of the ion @xcite .",
    "alternatively , as studied here , the molecule can undergo recollision - induced dissociation @xmath4 where the strong field ionizes d@xmath1 in the first step . in the second step",
    ", the continuum electron excites the bound electron from the @xmath5 bonding state to the @xmath6 antibonding state thereby dissociating the molecule .",
    "this process has been demonstrated experimentally , and used to probe the vibrational motion of the d@xmath0 nuclear wave packet following the initial ionization of d@xmath1 on sub - femtosecond time scales @xcite .    here , we consider the dissociative recollision process from a coherent control perspective .",
    "first , a full dimensional quantum model , based on the strong field approximation ( sfa ) , is constructed .",
    "the model is then validated by successfully simulating the experiment , which is shown to be an example of pump - dump control , consistent with a perspective long - held by the experimental nrc group @xcite .",
    "second , the scenario is extended to _",
    "bichromatic _ coherent control using an initial superposition of d@xmath1 vibrational states .",
    "considerable control is demonstrated , motivating future experimental studies .",
    "third , field - free scattering of d@xmath0 and e@xmath7 wave packets is studied in order to connect the observed control of dissociative recollision with the recently constructed theory of wave - packet coherent control of reactive scattering @xcite .",
    "fourth , the role of entanglement , previously suggested to be connected to the vibrational probing scenario @xcite , is investigated .",
    "specifically , by comparing the vibrational probing scenario to similar scenarios using field - free non - entangled scattering states we demonstrate that it is the temporal correlations between the scattering wave packets , and not entanglement , that allow for probing and control in dissociative recollision . nevertheless , entanglement is still present , and we conclude the paper by identifying its signatures , detectable in coincidence measurements .    for coherent control ,",
    "these results are of interest because they identify new experimentally accessible examples of both bichromatic control and wave - packet control of reactive scattering . for strong field recollision ,",
    "these results are important because they clarify the role of entanglement in recollision - based probing techniques @xcite , and motivate new strong field recollision control experiments .",
    "the sfa , a well - known method in strong field physics @xcite , is here developed for the dissociative recollision scenario .",
    "we utilize the sfa in the length gauge , and work in the single active electron approximation in that only the action of the laser on the ionized electron is considered , while the bound electron and nuclei do not interact directly with the strong field . in general",
    ", there could also be strong laser - induced coupling between the bound - electronic states leading to strong field molecular effects ( e.g. bond - softening , enhanced ionization ) that would affect the nuclear states .",
    "however , the dissociative recollision experiments being modeled used an angle - limited detection scheme to selectively measure d@xmath8 fragments coming predominantly from molecules aligned perpendicular to the laser field @xcite",

    "small variations are present , for example the distributions in the field - free case are all a bit narrower than their field - free counterparts , but this is likely due to small differences between the actual recollision state and that used to mimic this state in the field - free scenario . when comparing the phase dependence of the d@xmath8 yields [ panel ( c ) of figs .",
    "[ figscattering ] and [ figbichromaticcalc ] ] , one sees that the general sinusoidal dependence is perfectly captured by the field - free scenario .",
    "it is therefore clear that the strong field and field - free cases behave in essentially similar ways , and hence that the dissociative recollision scenario offers an example of wave - packet control of reactive scattering .",
    "we now address the importance of entanglement in dissociative recollision .",
    "specifically , the literature suggests a connection between the sub - femtosecond time resolution present in the vibrational probing of the d@xmath156 wave packet and entanglement @xcite .",
    "the entanglement under consideration is that between the electron and ion after ionization and before recollision : when the d@xmath1 is ionized , the resultant wave function is separable in relative and center - of - mass coordinates , similar to eq .",
    "( [ eqpsitrans ] ) , but not separable in the ion and electron coordinates .",
    "the question of entanglement is also central to the coherent control of reactive scattering @xcite . in that case ,",
    "initial state entanglement is required for control when using superpositions of a few isolated translational plane waves @xcite .",
    "recent results show , however , that initial state entanglement is not necessary when working with specific scenarios utilizing wave packets of translational motion @xcite involving energetically degenerate pathways .",
    "the dissociative recollision scenario features such pathways , as noted above , and hence it is conceivable that entanglement is neither crucial for control nor for vibrational probing .",
    "this is examined below .    .",
    "the @xmath153 values correspond to the pump - dump time delays for the wave lengths used in fig.[figpumpdump ] . ]    to gain insight into the role of entanglement , we consider once again the analogous field - free case with independently prepared wave packets of d@xmath0 and e@xmath7 , but this time without entanglement present .",
    "that is , our initial state is @xmath157",

    "the @xmath143 are the same as those used above .",
    "recall that the @xmath162 and @xmath160 are momenta in the laboratory frame .",
    "figure [ fignoentangleprobe ] shows the results of mimicking the dissociative recollision probing / pump - dump scenario using the field - free non - entangled scattering scenario .",
    "the pump - dump time delay was varied by controlling @xmath153 , and results for the four values of @xmath153 corresponding to the wave lengths used in the strong field pump - dump scenario are shown . upon comparing fig .",
    "[ fignoentangleprobe ] with fig .",
    "[ figpumpdump ] , one sees that the non - entangled field - free scattering scenario does capture the vibrational motion just as well as did the strong field recollision scenario .",
    "note that the @xmath112 peak height increases as @xmath153 becomes larger in the field - free scenario , but the analogous peak height in the strong field case remains roughly constant .",
    "the change in total yield in the field - free case is present because the cross section for electron impact dissociation of d@xmath0 depends strongly on the internuclear distance ; as the bond is allowed to stretch , it becomes easier to dissociate . in the strong field case , as the wave length is varied and the pump - dump time delay increases , the continuum electron wave packet spreads more in the transverse direction , thus counteracting the expected increase in the total yield as the bond length stretches .",
    "these results directly imply that it is the temporal correlations between the incident electron wave packet and the vibrational motion of the ion that is necessary for probing / control , but entanglement is not .",
    "further , the general agreement between fig . [ fignoentangleprobe ] and fig . [ figpumpdump ] strengthens the argument that dissociative recollision scenarios can be considered as examples of wave - packet coherent control of reactive scattering .",
    "the theory of wave - packet coherent control of reactive scattering is discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .",

    "although electron - ion entanglement is not central to probing or control , the fact remains that entanglement is present .",
    "the entangled nature of the multiparticle density can be revealed through coincidence measurements , where the d@xmath106 kinetic energy spectrum is measured together with the recollision electron .",
    "the ionization , and subsequent recollision , certainly leads to multiparticle correlations in the outgoing state .",
    "however , to demonstrate entanglement , one must show non - separable wave function characteristics , which include correlated observables and coherence . when using a driving pulse with many cycles , the outgoing flux originating from each half cycle",
    "will interfere , hence providing a means to verify the coherence of the final wave function .",
    "figure [ figdetectentangle]a shows a slice through the final momentum distribution of the scattered electron taken at @xmath107 = 6 ev and @xmath164 = 0 , calculated for a five - cycle 800 nm pulse .",
    "the ring structure , similar to the well known above - threshold ionization ( ati ) peaks , appear as result of the periodic nature of strong field ionization .",
    "each half - cycle an electron wave packet is launched into the continuum . all these wave packets then interfere to produce the rings . in an energy representation each ring is separated by one unit of the photon energy .",
    "since dissociative recollision also occurs each half cycle , similar ati - like structures exist in the d@xmath8 energy spectrum , fig.[figdetectentangle]b , again a result of interferences between the outgoing d@xmath8 flux originating from each half - cycle . the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ figdetectentangle]b corresponds to @xmath163 = 0 and @xmath164 = 0 .",
    "unlike one - electron ati , the ring structures resulting from dissociative recollision only appear when both the recollision electron and the d@xmath8 are measured in coincidence , that is , the structure exist only in such spectra .",
    "further , since the rings are a result of quantum interference , the resulting wave function is necessarily coherent .",
    "observation of these ati - like rings in the coincidence spectra would then demonstrate the entanglement that is necessarily present during the dissociative recollision process .",
    "we have considered the attosecond dissociative electron recollision in d@xmath1 from the perspective of coherent control . both pump - dump and bichromatic control schemes were demonstrated in this system .",
    "further , by direct comparison of the strong field recollision scenario with analogous field - free cases , it was shown that this system offers an example of wave - packet coherent control of reactive scattering . by constructing and analyzing similar scenarios involving scattering of non - entangled field - free wave packets",
    ", it was shown that the electron - ion entanglement effectively plays no role in the control scenario presented herein nor in the closely related problem of recollision - based sub - femtosecond vibrational probing @xcite .",
