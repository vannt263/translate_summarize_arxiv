    "the growth process in  @xcite is defined as a discrete - time markov chain @xmath6 with values in @xmath7 and specified by the following transition probabilities @xmath20 where @xmath21 @xmath22 is a positive number and the other notations are the same as before .",
    "it is easy to see that the process defined by transition probabilities ( [ tran ] ) is the corresponding limit process as @xmath23 . in turn",
    ", the growth process specified by the transition probabilities ( [ growth ] ) is a particular version of the cooperative sequential adsorption model ( csa ) .",
    "csa is a probabilistic model which is widely used in physics for modelling various adsorption processes ( see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) . some asymptotic and statistical studies of similar csa in a continuous setting were undertaken in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    in  @xcite",
    "we consider the following variants of neighbourhood & * ( a1 ) * & u_i=\\{i } + & * ( a2 ) * & u_i=\\{i , i+1 } + & * ( a3 ) * & u_i=\\{i-1 , i , i+1 } where , due to the periodic boundary conditions , @xmath24 in case * ( a2 ) * and @xmath25 in case * ( a3 ) * respectively .",
    "it is easy to see that for the growth process studied in this paper the case * ( a1 ) * is trivial .",
    "therefore , we will consider cases * ( a2 ) * and * ( a3 ) * only .",
    "a stochastic process @xmath26 formed by the sites potentials plays an important role in our asymptotic study of the growth process .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath27 is also a markov chain , with transition probabilities given by @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "this process has the following rather obvious queueing interpretation ( s.  foss , personal communications ) explaining the title of the paper ( originally titled ` random sequential adsorption at extremes ' ) .",
    "namely , consider a system with @xmath4 servers , with the clients arriving in bunches of @xmath30 in case * ( a2 ) * and of @xmath31 in case * ( a3)*. the quantity @xmath14 is interpreted as the number of clients at server @xmath11 at time @xmath16 . in case * ( a2 ) * , of the two clients in the arriving pair , one joins the shortest queue , the other its left neighbouring queue , the two choices being equally likely . in case * ( a3 ) * , of the three clients in an arriving triple , one joins the shortest queue , the others its left and right neighbouring queues , the choices being equally likely .",
    "our goal is to describe the long time behaviour of the growth process , or , equivalently , to describe the limiting queueing profile of the network .",
    "it should be noted that the method of proof in this paper is purely combinatorial .",
    "this is in contrast with  @xcite , where the results are proved by combining the martingale techniques from @xcite with some probabilistic techniques used in the theory of reinforced processes from @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "observe that the model considered here can be viewed as a randomized _ tetris _ game , and hence it can possibly be analyzed using the techniques of max - plus algebra as well ; see @xcite and section 1.3 of @xcite for details .    for the sake of completeness ,",
    "let us mention another limit case of the growth process specified by transition probabilities ( [ growth ] ) : namely , the limit process arising as @xmath32 .",
    "it is easy to see that the limit process in this case describes the allocation process in which a particle is allocated with equal probabilities to one of the sites with maximal potential .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour ( as @xmath33 ) of this limit process is briefly discussed in section [ binf ] .",
    "[ thm : a3_b0 ] suppose @xmath43 , @xmath8",
    ". then with probability @xmath2 there exists the limit @xmath44 , which takes a finite number of possible values with positive probabilities .",
    "the set of limiting configurations consists of those @xmath45 which simultaneously satisfy the following properties :    * there exists an @xmath46 such that @xmath47 for all @xmath8 ; also @xmath48 ; * if @xmath49 , then @xmath50 or @xmath51 , or both ; * if @xmath52 , then @xmath53 where @xmath54 ; * if @xmath55 , then @xmath56 ; * if @xmath57 is divisible by @xmath31 , then @xmath58 for @xmath59 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , the adsorption eventually stops at all @xmath8 where @xmath49 , that is @xmath60 additionally , if the initial configuration is empty , then for each @xmath49 we must have that * both * @xmath50 * and * @xmath51 .",
    "we will derive the asymptotic behaviour of the process @xmath61 from the asymptotic behaviour of the process of potentials . in turn the study of the process of potentials",
    "is greatly facilitated by analysis of the following auxiliary process [ eqv(t ) ] v_k(t)=u_k(t)-m(t ) ,  k=1,  ,m .",
    "observe that @xmath62 also forms a markov chain on @xmath63 and for each @xmath16 there is a @xmath19 such that @xmath64 .",
    "loosely speaking , the quantities @xmath65 , @xmath66 ,  , @xmath4 , represent what happens ` on the top of the growth profile ' .",
    "it turns out that in the asymmetric case there is a single class of recurrent states to which the chain eventually falls and then stays in forever . as we show later , this class is a certain subset of the set @xmath67 containing the origin @xmath68 .",
    "thus a certain ` stability ' of the process of potentials is observed as time goes to infinity .",
    "in particular , it yields , as we show , that there will not be long queues in the system if @xmath4 is odd ; however , this does not prevent occurrence of relatively long queues if @xmath4 is even .",
    "for instance , if @xmath4 is even , then one can easily imagine the profile with peaks at even sites , and zeros at odd sites .",
    "besides , observe that the sum of the potentials of the even sites equals the sum of the potentials of the odd sites ( see proposition [ prop : even ] ) ; therefore the difference between the total queue to the even sites , and the total queue to the odd ones , behaves similarly to the zero - mean random walk .",
    "it means that there are rather long periods of time during which much longer queues are observed at the even sites in comparison with the queues at the odd sites , and vice versa .",
    "thus , in the case of the asymmetric interaction we observe in the limit @xmath33 a ` comb pattern ' when @xmath4 is even , and a ` flat pattern ' when @xmath4 is odd .",
    "the picture is completely different in the symmetric case .",
    "the markov chain @xmath62 is transient for any @xmath4 ; moreover , there can be only finitely many paths along which the chain escapes to infinity . by this",
    "we mean that if the chain reaches a state belonging to a particular _ escape path _",
    ", then it will never leave it and will go to infinity along this path , and we will show that there can be only a finite number of limit patterns .",
    "an escape path can be viewed as _ an attractor _ , since similar effects are observed in neural network models studied in @xcite and @xcite . in fact , the markov chain @xmath62 describes the same dynamics as the neural network models in @xcite and @xcite though in a slightly different set - up .",
    "the difference seems to be technical but it results in quite different model behaviour .",
    "we do not investigate this issue in depth here .",
    "table  [ tabl2 ] contains the list of all possible limiting configurations ( for proportions of customers / particles ) for small @xmath4 , while in table  [ tabl3 ] we provide only the numbers of possible limiting configurations for some larger @xmath4 .",
    "note that in the tables the symbol @xmath69 stands for the configurations which can not be achieved from the empty initial configuration . unfortunately , we can not compute exact numbers of possible limiting configurations for any @xmath4 ;",
    "nor can we predict which of them will be more likely ( though it is obvious that if we start with the empty initial configuration , all possible limits which can be obtained by a rotation of the same @xmath70 will have the same probability . )      in the asymmetric case the potential of site @xmath19 at time @xmath16 is @xmath71 the transition probabilities of the markov chain @xmath72 are given by @xmath73 for @xmath29 , where @xmath13 is the number of @xmath14 equal to @xmath15 .",

    "if , on the other hand , @xmath275 , without loss of generality say @xmath276 , then this property will be also preserved for all @xmath277 and each new particle will be adsorbed with probability @xmath278 at either @xmath11 or @xmath116 .    finally , if @xmath279 , say @xmath280 , then at time @xmath281 either @xmath282 if the adsorption occurred at @xmath116 , or @xmath283 or @xmath284 otherwise . by iterating this argument",
    "we obtain that after a geometric number of times we will arrive at the situation where @xmath285 , and then the process will follow the pattern described in the previous paragraph .",
