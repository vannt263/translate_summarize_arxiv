    "the robust discovery of neutrino oscillations in the propagation of solar and atmospheric neutrinos  @xcite , confirmed at accelerator and reactor neutrino sources  @xcite has provided us with a rather solid proof for the existence of neutrino masses and mixing  @xcite and hence the clearest evidence for the need of physics beyond the standard model ( sm )  @xcite .",

    "neutrino mass stands out as one of the biggest challenges in particle physics  @xcite .",
    "a generic feature of many such schemes is the presence of non - vanishing neutrino electromagnetic ( em ) properties  @xcite .",
    "while the neutrino masses indicated by oscillation data are perhaps too small to induce sizeable magnetic moments , this issue is rather model dependent , and one can not exclude this possibility on general grounds  @xcite . if large enough , these may still play an important sub - leading role in precision neutrino studies  @xcite , despite the good agreement found within the three - neutrino oscillation picture .",
    "non - zero diagonal magnetic moments exist for massive dirac neutrinos .",
    "in contrast , in the general majorana neutrino case all magnetic moments are transition - type .",
    "therefore , the study of neutrino magnetic moments would be a powerful tool towards distinguishing their dirac or majorana character  @xcite .",
    "the detection of neutral - current ( nc ) coherent elastic neutrino - nucleus scattering ( cenns ) processes by measuring the nuclear recoil spectrum of the scattered nucleus has by now become feasible  @xcite . as a concrete example",
    ", the newly formed coherent collaboration at the spallation neutron source ( sns ) has excellent prospects  @xcite , motivating also theoretical effort  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we consider the possibility of revealing signs of new physics through a detailed study of cenns at the texono experiment  @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that the use of sub - kev germanium - based kg - scale detectors  @xcite , provides a favourable experimental set up with good prospects for performing precision sm tests , as well as probing em neutrino properties  @xcite , such as the neutrino magnetic moment  @xcite and the neutrino charge radius  @xcite .",
    "the total number of events expected in an experiment searching for cenns depends strongly on the energy threshold @xmath4 , as well as the total mass of the detector  @xcite . for low energy thresholds and more massive detectors ,",
    "the total number of events expected is significantly larger and , therefore , the attainable sensitivities are higher . in addition , this work highlights that the present calculations become more realistic by considering quenching effect corrections  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity is evaluated by assuming that a given experiment searching for cenns events will measure exactly the sm expectation .",
    "thus , any deviation  @xcite is understood as a signature of new physics  @xcite .",
    "apart from the possibility of the first ever detection of cenns events , our present results emphasise the potentiality of discovering neutrino interactions beyond the sm expectations  @xcite . in our estimates",
    "we perform nuclear structure calculations within the context of the quasi - particle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) that uses realistic nuclear forces   @xcite , and employ a @xmath5-type statistical analysis .",
    "we find that the prospects for improving current bounds on @xmath6 are rather promising and complementary to future sensitivities on the muon neutrino magnetic moment , @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the coherent elastic scattering of neutrinos upon a nucleus is described within the sm starting from the neutrino - quark nc interaction lagrangian . however , as mentioned above , one has good reasons to expect corrections coming from new physics  @xcite , such as non - standard interactions ( nsi )  @xcite or non - trivial neutrino em properties  @xcite .      within the context of sm , for low energies ( @xmath8 ) accessible to neutrino experiments ,",

    "we stress that the differential cross section is evaluated with high significance by weighting the nuclear matrix element with corrections provided by the proton ( neutron ) nuclear form factors @xmath33 . this way the finite nuclear size is taken into account with respect to the typical momentum transfer , @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath35 enhancement of the cenns cross section makes the relevant experiments favourable facilities to probe the neutron form factor of the target nucleus at low energies  @xcite .    from a nuclear theory point of view , the reliability of the present cenns cross sections calculations is maximised in terms of accuracy by performing nuclear structure calculations in the context of qrpa  @xcite . motivated by its successful application on similar calculations for various semi - leptonic nuclear processes  @xcite , in this work",

    "even though from oscillation data the latter is well - known to be small , one can not rule out the possibility of sizeable neutrino magnetic moments .",
    "indeed , in general scenarios where neutrinos are majorana fermions , as expected on general grounds , larger transition magnetic moments are possible .",
    "for example , relatively sizeable contributions may be predicted in models involving nsi  @xcite . from experimental perspectives ,",
    "a potential signal will be detected as a distortion of the nuclear recoil spectrum at very low energies where the em cross section dominates due to its @xmath41 dependence .",
    "for this reason , such challenging technological constraints require innovative experimental advances towards reducing the threshold to the sub - kev region . despite having vanishing electric charge , the first derivative in the expansion of the neutrino electric form factor entering the decomposition of the leptonic matrix element may provide non - trivial information concerning other neutrino electric properties  @xcite .",

    "the numerical results throughout this work refer to a 1  kg @xmath45ge - detector , one year of data taking and a detector threshold of @xmath69 .",
    "in addition , we consider two different detector efficiencies including an optimistic approach of a perfectly efficient detection capability and the more realistic scenario assuming a recoil acceptance of 50% .",
    "the present calculations take into consideration the fact that the nuclear recoil events are quenched  @xcite ( in ref .",
    "@xcite , where for each target the calculation is referred to the nuclear recoil - energy window  @xcite , such a treatment is not necessary ) .",
    "corrections of this type are crucial since for a given ionisation detector the observed energy ( equivalent to an electron energy ) is lower than the total nuclear recoil - energy , i.e. much energy is converted to heat ( phonons ) which is not measured , especially at low energies  @xcite . to convert from nuclear recoil - energy ( @xmath70 ) to electron equivalent energy ( @xmath71 ) , we multiply the energy scale by a quenching factor , @xmath72 . in principle @xmath72",

    "we show explicitly that the sensitivities improve by up to one order of magnitude with respect to previous estimates . in this paper",
    "we have used realistic nuclear structure calculations within the context of the quasi - particle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) and a simple @xmath5-type analysis taking into account quenching effects .",
    "we have also checked that our sensitivities are determined mainly by the number of events : a binned sample would result in differences less than percent .",

    "<S> the possibility of measuring neutral - current coherent elastic neutrino - nucleus scattering ( cenns ) at the texono experiment has opened high expectations towards probing exotic neutrino properties . </S>",
    "<S> focusing on low threshold germanium - based targets with kg - scale mass , we find a remarkable efficiency not only for detecting cenns events due to the weak interaction , but also for probing novel electromagnetic neutrino interactions . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we demonstrate that such experiments are complementary in performing precision standard model tests as well as in shedding light on sub - leading effects due to neutrino magnetic moment and neutrino charge radius . </S>",
    "<S> this work employs realistic nuclear structure calculations based on the quasi - particle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) and takes into consideration the crucial quenching effect corrections . </S>",
    "<S> such a treatment , in conjunction with a simple statistical analysis , shows that the attainable sensitivities are improved by one order of magnitude as compared to previous studies .    </S>",
