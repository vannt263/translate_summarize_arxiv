    "rayleigh - bnard convection ( rbc ) in which fluid confined between two plates is heated from below and cooled on the top is an idealized yet an important paradigm to understand convective turbulence .",
    "the dynamics of rbc is governed by the two non - dimensional parameters : the rayleigh number @xmath3 and the prandtl number @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the vertical height of the container , @xmath6 is the acceleration due to gravity , @xmath7 is the temperature difference between the bottom and top plates , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the thermal heat expansion coefficient , thermal diffusivity , and kinematic viscosity , respectively , of the fluid .",
    "@xcite performed experiments on water ( @xmath11 ) and silicon oil ( @xmath12 ) and observed coherent roll structures , also known as `` large scale circulation '' ( lsc ) , in the turbulent regime .",
    "subsequently , @xcite ascertained the existence of lsc in helium ( @xmath13-@xmath14 ) contained in a cylindrical container .",
    "they proposed that coherent large scale structures exist statistically only above a certain rayleigh number ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "they also observed a low frequency peak in the power spectrum of the temperature field .",
    "@xcite studied the onset of large - scale coherent mean flow in rbc using shadowgraph and particle image velocimetry techniques and showed that lsc is a result of the organization of plume motion .",
    "@xcite performed rbc experiments on mercury ( @xmath16 ) and placed several thermistors along the azimuth of the cylinder .",
    "they deduced the presence of global circulation from the dipolar temperature distribution measured by the probes .",
    "the temperature fluctuations ( after subtracting the mean ) switched sign randomly in their experiment .",
    "since the warmer fluid ascends from one side , and the cooler fluid descends from the other side of the apparatus , @xcite deduced that the vertical velocity would also exhibit random `` reversals '' in phase with the temperature fluctuations .",
    "this feature of convection has been studied extensively using theoretical , experimental , and computational tools  ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite , and @xcite reported reversals in their convection experiments on helium . @xcite and @xcite performed similar experiments on water ( @xmath21 ) and measured the temperature field in the bulk using probes placed at @xmath22th , @xmath18 and @xmath23th height of the cylinder . they observed that the plane containing lsc exhibits diffusive and sometimes quick significant drift in the azimuthal direction with the angular change ( @xmath24 ) ranging from small values to @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath25 .",
    "this is called the `` reorientation '' of lsc .",
    "the reorientation of the flow can occur in two ways : ( a ) through rotation of the circulation plane without any major reduction of the circulation strength ; ( b ) through `` cessation '' of the circulation , followed by a restart in a randomly chosen new direction .",

    "various models have been proposed to understand the dynamical behaviour of the lsc . @xcite and",
    "@xcite proposed a stochastic model in which the reversal of lsc was explained as noise induced switching between two meta - stable states .",
    "@xcite attempted to explain the irregular cessation and subsequent reversal of the lsc using the force and thermal balance on a single plume modelled by coupled nonlinear equations related to the lorenz equations . @xcite and",
    "@xcite proposed a stochastic model with the strength and the azimuthal orientation of the lsc being determined by two stochastic ordinary differential equations ; this model appears to explain the experimental observations of cessation and reorientation .",
    "villermaux@xcite proposed a model to explain the low frequency oscillations in the temperature signal in the bulk .",
    "his model assumes that the modes of the boundary layers interact through the slow moving large scale circulation .",
    "there are only a small number of computational studies on the reorientation or reversal of lsc .",

    "note that in the rotation - led reorientations , the dipolar structure continues to be dominant during the reorientation itself .    in this section we present some of the complex dynamics of the reorientations of lsc .",
    "the reversals of the vertical velocity have been shown to be intimately related to the reorientations of lsc .",
    "we observe rotation - led and cessation - led reorientations , which were first reported by @xcite and @xcite , and observed later in other experiments @xcite . in our simulations we also find double cessation , previously observed by  @xcite .",
    "a new feature of our simulation is a double cessation in which the orientation of the lsc after the event is different from the original orientation . in our analysis",
    "we study higher fourier modes , notably @xmath193 , which was missing in earlier work on reversals .",
    "we propose a new interpretation of the cessation - led reorientations , and argue that the lsc transforms from dipolar ( @xmath192 dominant ) to quadrupolar ( @xmath193 dominant ) , and then back to dipolar ( @xmath192 dominant ) structure during this event .",
    "in summary , we numerically compute turbulent convective flows for a cylindrical geometry and study the characteristics of the lsc , in particular those related to flow reversals .",
    "the first fourier mode along the azimuthal direction is the most dominant mode ; the phase of this mode ( @xmath110 ) is used as a measure of the orientation of lsc .",
    "our numerical results and earlier experimental results indicate that the lsc occasionally reorients itself by rotating along the azimuthal direction by an arbitrary angle .",
    "when the reorientation angle is around @xmath17 , the vertical velocity at _ all _ probes change sign signaling complete reversal of the flow .",
    "a partial reversal is observed when the reorientation angle is less than @xmath17 .",
    "we therefore argue that the primary cause of the flow reversal is the azimuthal reorientation of the lsc .    in our numerical simulations",
    "we observe two kinds of reorientations : ( a ) rotation - led , and ( b ) cessation - led , earlier observed by  @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the rotation - led reversals involve rotation of the lsc without appreciable reduction in circulation strength , i.e. , the amplitude of @xmath138 remains finite . in the cessation - led reversals , @xmath181 , which is interpreted by @xcite and @xcite as cessation of circulation followed by a restart in a randomly chosen new direction . during this event",
    ", our numerical simulations reveal that the ratio of the amplitude of the second fourier mode and the first fourier mode , i.e. , @xmath146 , increases significantly , and then it comes back to its original level .",
    "these properties of the fourier modes reveal that during the cessation , the lsc transforms from a dipolar - like structure to a quadrupolar - like structure , and then back to a dipolar - like structure .",
    "these features appear to have certain similarities with the reversals of magnetic field in dynamo  @xcite .",
    "the role of higher fourier modes for reversals and reorientations of lsc have been highlighted in our simulations for the first time .",
    "we also observe double cessation in our simulations .",
    "@xcite had observed in their experiments that the lsc returns to its original orientation ( approximately ) after a double cessation .",
    "we however find in our numerical simulations that the change of the orientations of lsc during some double cessations are zero , while in some others , the changes are nonzero .",
    "our numerical simulations reproduced many features (  rotation - led reorientations \" , `` cessation - led reorientations '' , `` double cessation '' , etc . ) observed in convection experiments by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for rayleigh numbers greater than those in our simulations .",
    "several researchers have argued that the reorientations , including reversals , of lsc occur only under strong turbulence regimes ( say @xmath198 ) .",
    "we however observe that the nature of convective flows and reorientations are very similar for the range of rayleigh numbers studied by us ( @xmath29 to @xmath75 ) .",
    "the lowest rayleigh number @xmath164 is probably in the weak turbulence regime where the lsc is not well organized , and @xmath199 is in the lower end of strong turbulence regime .",
    "we could not carry out simulations for even larger rayleigh numbers due to very expensive computational requirements for these runs .",
    "however we believe that reversals in high rayleigh number regimes are highly likely to be similar to those presented in the simulations .",
