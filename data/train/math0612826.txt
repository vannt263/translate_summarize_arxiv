    "the n - body problem is a classical and important problem in celestial mechanics and mathematics .",
    "it consists of determining the orbits of n bodies interacting in accordance with the gravitational law of newton .",
    "that is two bodies attracting each other , the force of attraction being directed along the line joining them , proportional to the product of the masses , and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them . for given @xmath0 bodies ,",
    "the preceding n - body problem can be described by the following nonlinear system of second order differential equations : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mass of @xmath3th body , @xmath4 is the position of @xmath3th body in @xmath5 , @xmath0 is the number of bodies , and @xmath6 is the universal gravitational constant , which is always taken to be 1 for convenience in mathematics .",
    "hence we take @xmath7 in this paper .",
    "poincar showed that it is impossible for @xmath8 to find an explicit expression for the general solution .",
    "so even for the three - body problem , it is impossible to describe all the solutions .",
    "till now , for planar three - body problem , there are only three orbits are found clearly for three equal masses , including the existence and the shape of the orbits .",
    "they are euler s solution ( see fig.[euler ] ) , lagrange s solution ( see fig.[lagrange ] ) and figure - eight solution ( see fig.[eight ] ) .",
    "the euler s solution was discovered by euler in 1765 .",
    "it described a collinear configuration , in which one body locates on the center of masses of the three bodies , and the other two rotate around the center of the masses on the two endpoints of the diameter of the circle orbit .",
    "the lagrange solution was discovered by lagrange in 1772 .",
    "the three bodies form an equilateral triangle on a circle orbit and the center of masses is the origin all the time .",
    "the figure - eight solution is a new , surprisingly and remarkable solution after the two solutions , which was found numerically by moore first in 1993 ( see @xcite ) . in 2000 , chenciner and montgomery rediscovered it and proved its existence at the same time .",
    "it describes three equal masses chasing one by one on an eight - shaped curve in the plane .",
    "we refer the reader to the following articles and references therein for more detailed description : chenciner et al @xcite , montgomery @xcite and sim etc .",
    "there is no other specific result for @xmath8 .",
    "hence the numerical solution is more and more important in finding and describing new solutions vividly . in recent years",
    ", some new periodic solutions of the n - body problem have been found by minimizing the action of cycles with some special symmetric or choreographic constraint ( e.g. @xcite,@xcite etc ) , in which fourier approach is used by most authors for the numerical solutions of n - body problem . in this paper",
    ", we propose the n - body type difference equations , and from which we can discover some new periodic orbits by minimizing the corresponding action functional .",
    "the n - body type problems have been studied by bahri , rabinowitz @xcite , zelati @xcite among others . in @xcite , zelati proved the existence of periodic solutions under the radial symmetry assumption . in this paper",
    "we prove the existence of periodic solutions for the difference equations with multi - radial symmetric constraint , which includes the radial symmetry . in the section on numerical examples ,",
    "we propose a new variational difference method for the periodic solutions numerically .",
    "the periodic solutions for n - body type problems ( including n - body problems ) can be described by @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 are defined as above , @xmath11 in @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the period , and generally the singular potential function @xmath14 is @xmath15 with assumptions : @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we have @xmath18    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is usually described by @xmath21",
    "in order to formulate the difference equations for n - body type problems ( [ n])-([p ] ) , we discretize time within one period @xmath22 $ ] with @xmath23 points @xmath24 and denote the set of these discretized points as @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 , and introduce a difference scheme by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an abbreviation of @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the @xmath31th discretized point of @xmath22 $ ] , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the discretized step .",
    "moreover , the traditional forth difference scheme is used to approximate the derivative of @xmath34 , which is used in @xcite .",
    "then the first order difference of @xmath34 is @xmath35 and the second order difference of @xmath34 is @xmath36 hence the derivatives of @xmath37 can be approximated by @xmath38 by the difference approach above , ( [ n ] ) can be transformed into @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 for convenience , we set the following notations : @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 where @xmath45 @xmath46 it is easy to verify that @xmath47 is a positive definitive matrix . then the difference equation of ( [ n ] ) becomes @xmath48 and it is obviously that the difference boundary conditions can be described by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the set of positive integer .",
    "hence the lagrangian functional of ( [ n1])-([p1 ] ) is the following @xmath51    [ p0 ] there exists a small number @xmath52 for all @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , such that @xmath56 .",
    "then the solution @xmath57 of ( [ n1])-([p1 ] ) approximates the solution @xmath34 of ( [ n])-([p ] ) when @xmath58 .    since @xmath59",
    ", we can deduce the following equation from ( [ uil1 ] ) and ( [ u ] ) , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a constant . similar to ( [ ds ] ) , we introduce the difference scheme to @xmath62 , i.e. we have @xmath63 where @xmath64 $ ] and @xmath65 . notice that @xmath66 then when we let @xmath67 the system ( [ n])-([p ] ) can be rewritten as follows : @xmath68 where @xmath69 satisfies ( [ ds ] ) and @xmath70 , that is @xmath71    from ( [ ud ] ) , we have @xmath72 for some constant @xmath73 , and for @xmath74 , there exist @xmath75 , such that @xmath76 when @xmath77 . from ( [ ds ] ) , for @xmath78 $ ] , @xmath79 , clearly we have @xmath80 therefore , there exists a @xmath81 such that @xmath82    the error within one period can be estimated by @xmath83 hence @xmath84 from ( [ eq0 ] ) , noting that the discretized step is @xmath85 , we have @xmath86 this means @xmath87 , @xmath88 , i.e. @xmath89 when @xmath58 . the theorem is proved .",
    "let @xmath90 then the _ multi - radial symmetry _ can be described as follows : @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 is a common multiple of @xmath95 , and @xmath96 means @xmath97,\\quad \\tau\\in[t_{s-1},t_{s}].\\ ] ]",

    "[ l1 ] @xmath104 is a critical point of @xmath103 if and only if @xmath105 is a solution of ( [ n1])-([p1 ] ) .",
    "since the difference equations transform the infinite dimensional dynamics into finite dimensional dynamics , it is reasonable to view @xmath103 as a continuously differentiable functional on @xmath98 .",
    "let @xmath106 is the critical point of @xmath103 if and only if the first order derivative of @xmath103 on @xmath57 is equal to zero . that is @xmath107    notice that @xmath108 this satisfies ( [ n1])-([p1 ] ) obviously .",

    "that is , there exists @xmath52 such that no cycles in @xmath130 intersect the @xmath136-neighborhood of @xmath135 .    from ( [ sf ] ) ,",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath20 are all negative , then from ( [ u ] ) we have the following estimate for @xmath121 : @xmath137    let @xmath138 @xmath139 and let @xmath140 be the graph of @xmath141 in ( [ sf ] ) .",
    "suppose the binary relation is @xmath142 whose arc length is @xmath143 .",
    "then we have @xmath144    now let @xmath145 be a sequence in @xmath130 .",
    "if @xmath146 are not bounded away from @xmath135 , for @xmath74 , the @xmath147-neighborhood of @xmath135 in @xmath5 , @xmath148 , must intersect with infinite many @xmath146 . by passing to a subsequence",
    ", we can suppose that @xmath149 this implies that the corresponding @xmath150 ascend infinitely far up to the skylight of @xmath6 at @xmath135 as @xmath151 .",
    "suppose there exists @xmath52 , @xmath152 is @xmath136-neighborhood of @xmath135 , such that portions of @xmath146 fall outside the ball @xmath152 and the others ( infinite many ) @xmath146 in @xmath152 .",
    "then the variation of @xmath153 would become infinite as @xmath151 , but @xmath154 is greater than the variation of @xmath153 , a contradiction to the fact @xmath155 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if there is no such @xmath136 , @xmath146 will collapse to the point @xmath135 , which implies that @xmath156 this contradicts to the hypotheses at the beginning .",
    "hence @xmath121 is bounded away from @xmath135 .    now , suppose @xmath146 converge uniformly to @xmath157 in the norm in @xmath98 . by the above argument , if @xmath146 are not bounded away from @xmath135 , @xmath157 will be attached to @xmath135 .",
    "the proof is complete .",
    "( a ) for the case that the potential @xmath14 has more than one singular points has the same result in lemma 2 .",
    "\\(b ) lemma 2 means that there is no @xmath134 intersects the @xmath136-neighborhood of @xmath135 under ( [ sf ] ) condition .",
    "\\(c ) the converse - negative proposition of lemma 2 shows that if @xmath158 , @xmath159 weakly in @xmath98 and strongly in @xmath160 , then @xmath161 .    with respect to the periodic solutions of ( [ n1])-([p1 ] ) , we have the following theorem :    [ main ] let @xmath20 and @xmath121 in ( [ u ] ) satisfy ( [ a1])-([a3 ] ) and @xmath57 satisfy ( [ ms ] )",
    ". then ( [ n1])-([p1 ] ) has infinitely many generalized solutions ; furthermore , if ( [ sf ] ) holds , then ( [ n1])-([p1 ] ) has infinitely many non - collision solutions .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath162 is a subset of @xmath163 , and @xmath164 is an even function on @xmath162 for @xmath165 , so we can easily check that the critical points of ( [ jd ] ) on @xmath162 are also the critical points on @xmath163 .",
    "since @xmath20 does not satisfy ( [ sf ] ) , we can modify it as @xmath166 where @xmath136 is small and @xmath167 then we get a new lagrangian functional with condition ( [ sf ] ) from ( [ j ] ) , @xmath168 where @xmath169    let @xmath170 have infimum @xmath171    consider minimizing sequence @xmath172 such that @xmath173 when @xmath174 .",
    "then , when @xmath175 is large enough , we have @xmath176    since @xmath177 , we have that @xmath178 @xmath179 where @xmath180 .",
    "this illuminates that there exists a @xmath181 and a subsequence @xmath182 such that @xmath183 @xmath184 then @xmath185 is a critical point of ( [ jd ] ) .",
    "now , from the remarks of lemma [ l2 ] and lemma [ l1 ] , there exist a subsequence @xmath186 and @xmath187 in @xmath188 , such that @xmath187 is a non - collision periodic solution of n - body problem ( [ n1])-([p1 ] ) .    along the line of theorem1.1 in @xcite , we can find a generalized solution @xmath157 of ( [ n1])-([p1 ] ) by constructing compact nested interval cover of @xmath22\\backslash \\delta$ ] to show @xmath189 and @xmath190 when @xmath191 .",
    "we can also prove @xmath192 is a @xmath13-periodic solution of ( [ n1])-([p1 ] ) if @xmath193 is , where @xmath61 is a positive integer , then we can find infinitely many @xmath13-periodic solutions of ( [ n1])-([p1 ] ) .",
    "this completes the proof .",

    "the method of steepest descent is adopted in finding the minimum of the functional @xmath103 since this method is simple , easy to apply , and each iteration is fast .",
