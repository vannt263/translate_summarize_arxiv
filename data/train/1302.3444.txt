    "anomalous x - ray pulsars and soft @xmath3-ray repeaters are observationally identified with highly magnetized neutron stars , known as magnetars , with surface magnetic field @xmath4 g @xcite .",
    "the processes of supernova collapse will leave behind a strongly non - uniform frozen - in field distribution .",
    "also any dynamo mechanism generating fields will carry the imprint of inhomogeneous density profile in the star .",
    "thus , to maintain the local magneto - static equilibrium , more realistic treatment of the equation of state ( eos ) of matter for a magnetar requires inclusion of gradually increasing magnetic field from surface to center .",
    "massive compact stars are likely to develop exotic cores with one possibility of appearance of hyperons with the increasing density . in the present work , considering the radial profile of the magnetic field and carefully analyzing the different components of the field , we show that the pressure of the magnetar matter parallel to the magnetic field exhibits instability .",
    "to construct the model of dense matter , we employ non - linear walecka mean field theory @xcite of nuclear matter including the possibility of appearance of hyperons and muons at higher density . in the presence of magnetic field ,",
    "the lagrangian density of the system is @xmath5 , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the baryonic and leptonic lagrangian densities respectively in the presence of magnetic field @xcite and @xmath8 the electro - magnetic field tensor . for details ,",
    "see ref .  .",
    "total energy density and pressure of the system can be obtained by considering the energy - momentum tensor of the system @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the matter and field parts respectively . in the absence of electric field , and in the rest frame of fluid @xmath12 , \\label{tmunu}\\ ] ]",
    "when the magnetic field is considered to be along @xmath13-direction with @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the magnitude of magnetic field , @xmath16 the magnetization per unit volume , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are respectively the pressure and energy density of the matter .",
    "this clearly shows anisotropic nature of the pressure in the presence of ( strong ) magnetic field .",
    "@xmath18 is calculated using the charged single particle energy @xmath19 , considering the quantized phase space in the presence of magnetic field , where @xmath20 is the component of momentum along @xmath13-axis , @xmath21 the mass , @xmath22 the total charge , with @xmath23 being the electron s charge , of the particle , @xmath24 is the number of occupied landau level .",
    "then matter pressure is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are respectively the chemical potentials and number densities for baryons ( @xmath28 ) and leptons ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the density profile of the magnetic field is modeled as @xcite @xmath30\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath3 are two parameters , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are respectively the number densities of matter and nuclear matter , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are respectively the magnitudes of the magnetic field in the surface and center of the underlying magnetar .",
    "figure [ eos1]a shows eos for hypernuclear matter in strong and fixed magnetic field profiles . for non - zero magnetic field ,",
    "the pressure splits into the parallel ( @xmath36 ) and transverse ( @xmath37 ) components , and exhibits anisotropy .",
    "it is seen that the low - density behavior of eos with constant magnetic field implies unrealistically large anisotropic magnetic field up to the surface of the star , which is inconsistent with the inferred surface magnetic field ( @xmath38 g ) of magnetars .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ eos1]b that for a given value of @xmath31 , the eos becomes softer with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "consequently , beyond a certain critical @xmath3 and in a certain density regime , @xmath17 ceases to increase ( and eventually decreases ) with the further increase in @xmath32 .",
    "this implies the onset of instability of matter above that value of density for that particular @xmath35 and magnetic field profile .",
    "we also show the results for each @xmath31 with @xmath39 ( minimum value ) .",
    "note that the maximum @xmath3 is taken in such a way that @xmath17 forms a plateau as a function @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , it is evident that with the decrease of @xmath31 , the instability occurs at larger values of @xmath3 and @xmath32 .",
    "the instability arises due to the negative contribution from the field energy density to the pressure of magnetized baryons and leptons in the direction of the magnetic field , which is evident from eq .",
    "( [ tmunu ] ) . with the increase of @xmath32 , more negative contribution",
    "is added to @xmath17 , and consequently at a certain @xmath32 , @xmath17 ceases to increase and then decreases with the increase of @xmath32 , rendering instability .",
    "we have found that for sufficiently large magnetic fields with @xmath40 g , the magnetar matter becomes unstable .",
    "the instability is associated with the anisotropic effects arised due to the magnetic field .",
    "the onset of instability depends on the magnetic field profile and @xmath35 , which puts a natural upper bound for the central magnetic field of neutron stars , which is @xmath41 g. + this work was partially supported by the grant isro / res/2/367/10 - 11 ( b.m . ) and the alexander von humboldt foundation ( m.s . ) .",
