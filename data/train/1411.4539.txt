    "the x - rays are collected from the sample through an adjustable entrance slit assembly , after which they are diffracted by a spherical grating .",
    "the diffracted x - rays are subsequently detected by a 2d multi - channel plate ( mcp ) detector .",
    "the image of the straight entrance slit through the spherical grating is curved , necessitating the 2d detection system ( see , for example , fig .  2 of ref .",
    "however , this curvature also affords the possibility of sampling below the natural pixel width of the mcp detector .    shown in fig .",
    "[ f : mcp](a ) is the 2d image of the region near the elastic peak of a representative rixs measurement , displaying the curved image of the elastic scattering , as well as a low - energy cf transition .",
    "the 2d image is binned into 1024 horizontal `` energy '' channels ( actually evenly - spaced in wavelength ) , and 32 vertical `` slices '' .",
    "next to this image , in fig .",
    "[ f : mcp](b ) , iso - energy curves are shown for the same measurement at the same part of the detector .",
    "in addition to the obvious offset in energy between each slice , the individual slices each have their own ( different ) calibration ( pixel width ) .",
    "it is clear that , in general , there is a non - integer offset ( in pixels ) between each slice , which means that the centres of each pixel do no align .",
    "when correcting for the curvature , one is therefore faced with two possibilities : 1 ) to share the counts of a pixel that is offset by a fractional amount with the bins either side ( i.e.  bilinear interpolation ) , which is the conventional approach , or 2 ) to sample the data below the natural pixel width , and take advantage of this extra fidelity .",
    "sub - pixel sampling does not improve the instrument resolution , of course , since this is limited by the optics of the detector and the width of the entrance slit .",
    "however , it does allow for higher data fidelity , which is useful in assessing whether low - energy features of the data are due to random noise , or intrinsic to the system under investigation . at broad resolution functions",
    ", there is little to be gained by sub - pixel sampling , since one is already sampling at a small fraction of the resolution function using the natural pixel width .",
    "however , in our measurements , we set the instrument resolution function to 0.26  ev fwhm ( the smallest achievable slit width with manageable count rates ) , and the natural pixel width of 0.13  ev only samples the data at half of the resolution fwhm ( or more than 1 sigma ) . by using sub - pixel sampling , we are able to increase the fidelity to one tenth of the fwhm ( or one quarter of sigma ) . in fig .  [",
    "f : mcp](c ) , the centre in relative energy of each pixel is shown by the points , with the conventional natural pixel width indicated by the vertical solid lines , indicating the energy coverage of the mcp detector .",
    "the vertical dashed lines correspond to sub - pixel sampling every fifth of a pixel , with many pixels contributing to each sampling point .",
    "( a )  close - up of the image of the mcp of a typical v @xmath1-edge rixs measurement , illustrating the pronounced curvature in the detected image .",
    "( b )  iso - energy contours of the image shown in ( a ) , showing the curvature function .",
    "( c )  pixel coverage of the mcp shown in ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "each dot represents the centre in energy of one of the pixels in one of the slices in ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the solid vertical lines represent the natural pixel width of the mcp , and the vertical dashed lines correspond to sub - pixel sampling at one - fifth of a pixel . ]",
    "owing to the varying pixel coverage of sub - pixel sampling , and the unknown errors introduced by the ( bilinear ) interpolation , a reliable error map is difficult to quantify at the sub - pixel level . instead , in figs .",
    "4 and 5 of the manuscript , we have chosen to present the data using statistical error bars for the data points that are sampled at the natural pixel width , with the sub - pixel sampled data points shown as lines connecting these points ( in effect , ` guides for the eye ' ) .",
    "we believe this is the fairest way of the presenting this kind of analysis , where we make no direct claim on the error distribution of the sub - pixel sampled data points , but this information is provided as a qualitative impression of the higher fidelity that is available .",
    "finally , the analysis of simulated data indicates that this approach does not introduce artefacts in the data .",
    "we emphasise that no cubic interpolants , or other high - order interpolation methods are used  only bilinear interpolation is used to distribute the counts ( which is incapable , by itself , of developing peaks between data points ) .",
