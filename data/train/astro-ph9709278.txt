    "using doppler spectroscopy astronomers are populating a zoo of giant planets and brown dwarfs orbiting nearby stars , including @xmath0 boo , 51 peg , @xmath1 and , 55 cnc , @xmath2 crb , 70 vir , 16 cyg b , and 47 uma ( noyes  1997 ; butler  1997 ; cochran  1997 ; marcy & butler 1996 ; butler & marcy 1996 ; mayor & queloz 1995 ; latham  1989 ) .",
    "table 1 lists these newly  discovered planets / brown dwarfs , in order of increasing semi  major axis , along with the giant planets in our solar system and the brown dwarf gl229 b. the direct detection of gl229 b ( oppenheimer   1995 ; nakajima  1995 ; matthews  1996 ; geballe  1996 ; marley  1996 ; allard  1996 ; tsuji  1996 ) was a watershed , since it has methane spectral features and an inferred effective temperature ( in this case , t@xmath3@xmath4950 k ) far below that at the solar  metallicity main sequence edge ( @xmath41750 k , burrows  1993 ) . in addition , the almost complete absence of the spectral signatures of metal oxides and hydrides ( such as tio , vo , feh , and cah ) is in keeping with theoretical predictions that these species are depleted in the atmospheres of all but the youngest ( hence , hottest ) substellar objects and are sequestered in condensed form below the photosphere ( lunine  1989 ; marley  1996 ) . also shown in table 1 are the primary s metallicity ( g. gonzalez , private communication ) , , orbit period , eccentricity , and distance to the sun .",
    "the wide range in mass and period , as well as the proximity of many of the planets / brown dwarfs to their primaries , was not anticipated by most planetary scientists . though the technique of doppler spectroscopy used to find most of these companions selects for massive , nearby objects , their variety and existence is a challenge to conventional theory . since",
    "direct detection is now feasible , and has been demonstrated by the recent acquisition of gl229 b , it is crucial for the future of extrasolar planet searches that the spectra , colors , evolution , and physical structure of objects from saturn s mass ( 0.3@xmath5 jupiter s mass , ) to 70 be theoretically investigated .    in parallel with these recent planetary and brown dwarf discoveries",
    "has been the much more detailed scrutiny in the optical and the near  infrared of hot young brown dwarfs and late m dwarfs near the main  sequence edge ( _ cf . _",
    "kirkpatrick , henry , & simons 1995 ; jones & tsuji 1997 ; zapatero - osorio  1996 ; tinney  1995 ; delfosse 1997 ) .",
    "finally , we are obtaining photometry and spectroscopy for collections of objects that _ bracket _ the substellar limit .",
    "what they reveal is a plethora of objects that populate a rising mass function , though not one that rises fast enough to have significant dynamical consequences for the galactic disk or halo ( chabrier & baraffe 1997 ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that edge objects reside in an unanticipated region of the h ",
    "r diagram and are much bluer in the near infrared than one would have expected from naive extrapolations of the early m dwarf sequence .",
    "grain formation , metal depletions ( _ e.g. _ , tio into perovskite , catio@xmath6 ) , and a shift of the important molecules with decreasing t@xmath3 are needed to understand high  gravity atmospheres from 3000 k to 1500 k ( lunine  1989 ; tsuji  1996 ; allard  1996 ) .",
    "clearly , new theoretical insights are required to separate very young and hot brown dwarfs from the more massive m dwarfs .    during the last two years , building upon our previous experience in the modeling of brown dwarfs and m stars , we published theoretical studies of the evolution and spectra of extrasolar giant planets ( egps ) ( burrows  1995 ; saumon  1996 ; guillot  1996 ; marley  1996 ; burrows  1997 ) .",
    "this work , initiated before the first discovery announcements in october of 1995 , is described below .    some of the space platforms and new ground  based facilities that have or will obtain infrared and optical data of extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs include the hst ( wfpc2 , nicmos ) , the irtf , the mmt 6.5-meter upgrade ( angel 1994 ) , the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) ( planned for mt .",
    "graham ) , keck s i and ii , the european iso , ukirt , ngst , the vlt , corot , denis , 2mass , and sirtf .",
    "one project of the keck i and ii facility , under the aegis of nasa s aseps-0 ( astronomical study of extrasolar planetary systems ) program , will be to search for giant planets around nearby stars . a major motivation for the palomar testbed interferometer supported by nasa is the search for extrasolar planets .",
    "recently , the nasa administrator outlined a program to detect planetary systems around nearby stars that may become a future scientific focus of nasa .",
    "this vision is laid out in the _ exploration of neighboring planetary systems ( exnps ) roadmap _ ( see also the `` tops '' report , 1992 ) .",
    ".*the bestiary * [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     ignoring for the moment the question of angular resolution , one can compare the theoretical solar  metallicity spectrum and color predictions of burrows  ( 1997 ) with putative detector sensitivities to derive encouraging detection ranges .",
    "for example , at 5 , sirtf might see a 1 gyr old , 1 object in isolation out to nearly 100 parsecs .",
    "the range of nicmos in @xmath7 for a 1 gyr old , 5 object is approximately 300 parsecs , while for a coeval 40 object it is near 1000 parsecs . furthermore , sirtf will be able to see at 5 a 5 gyr old , 20 object in isolation out to @xmath4400 parsecs and nicmos will be able to see at @xmath8 or @xmath7 a 0.1 gyr old object with the same mass out to @xmath42000 parsecs .",
    "these are dramatic numbers that serve to illustrate both the promise of the new detectors and the enhancements we theoretically predict .",
    "the ingredients needed to generate non  gray spectral , color , and evolutionary models of m dwarfs , brown dwarfs , and egps are clear . they include ( 1 ) equations of state for metallic hydrogen / helium mixtures and molecular atmospheres , ( 2 ) chemical equilibrium codes and thermodynamic data to determine the molecular fractions , ( 3 ) scattering and absorption opacities for the dominant chemical species , ( 4 ) an atmosphere code to calculate temperature / pressure profiles and to identify the radiative and convective zones , ( 5 ) an algorithm for converting a grid of atmospheres into boundary conditions for evolutionary calculations , ( 6 ) a henyey code , and ( 7 ) a radiative transfer code to provide emergent spectra . in principle",
    ", the calculation of the atmosphere , involving as it does radiative transfer , and the calculation of the emergent spectrum are done together .      for solar metallicity , near and above brown dwarf / egp photospheres , throughout most of their lives the dominant equilibrium form of carbon is ch@xmath9 , not co , that of oxygen is h@xmath10o , and that of nitrogen is either n@xmath10 or nh@xmath6 , depending upon t@xmath3 ( fegley & lodders 1996 ) .",
    "hydrogen is predominantly in the form of h@xmath10 .",
    "silicates and metals are found at high optical depths and temperatures .",
    "clouds of nh@xmath6 and h@xmath10o can form for t@xmath3s below @xmath4200 k and @xmath4400 k , respectively .",
    "for the burrows  ( 1997 ) models , we precipitated species according to their condensation curves , but did not consistently incorporate the effects of the associated clouds .",
    "if a species condensed , it was left at its saturated vapor pressure .",
    "water is an important source of opacity in late stellar and substellar objects , particularly when the many lines that originate from highly excited energy levels are considered .",
    "depending upon the temperature of the layer , and the assumed abundance of water , well over @xmath11 lines could be required for a calculation at the highest temperatures , while far fewer lines are needed at lower temperatures .",
    "we use the new partridge & schwenke h@xmath10o database .",
    "a synopsis of the opacity and line profile data we have employed to simulate egp and brown dwarf models follows .",
    "* partridge & schwenke ( 1997 ) h@xmath10o database : @xmath12 lines * hitran database ( rothman  1992 , 1997 ) * geisa database ( husson  1997 ) * ch@xmath9 and ch@xmath6d , @xmath13 lines ; co , @xmath14 lines , nh@xmath6 , @xmath15 lines , ph@xmath6 , @xmath16 lines , h@xmath10s , @xmath17 lines ( tyuterev  1994 ; goorvitch 1994 ; tipping 1990 ; wattson & rothman 1992 ; l. r. brown , private communication ) * modeled continuum opacity sources : @xmath18 and @xmath19 opacity and collision  induced absorption ( cia ) of h@xmath10 and helium ( borysow & frommhold 1990 ; zheng & borysow 1995 ) ; rayleigh scattering : rages  ( 1991 )      * line widths assumed to be due to h@xmath10 or h@xmath10 + he broadening : h@xmath10o ( brown & plymate 1996 ; gamache , lynch , & brown 1996 ) , co ( bulanin  1984 ; lemoal & severin 1986 ) ; ch@xmath9 ( margolis 1993,1996 ; l. r. brown , private communication ) ; ph@xmath6 ( levy , lacome , & tarrago 1994 ) ; nh@xmath6 ( brown & peterson 1994 ) * for other species , use n@xmath10 and o@xmath10induced widths      * the k  coefficient method ( goody  1989 ; lacis & oinas 1991 ) , widely used in planetary atmosphere and global climate modeling * not the odf technique ( saxner & gustafsson 1984 ) . that the gases have already been mixed _ before _",
    "the k coefficients are derived greatly diminishes problems . * typical errors in planetary atmospheres : between 1 and 10% ( grossman & grant 1992,1994 ) * supplemented by new feautrier code , bergeron atmosphere s code , _ etc . _      in the burrows  ( 1997 )",
    "exploration of egps and brown dwarfs , the chemical equilibrium calculations were performed with the atlas code and data from kurucz ( 1970 ) .",
    "recently , to the atlas code and data from kurucz ( 1970 ) , we have added the janaf tables and c. sharp s free  energy minimization code ( 1501500 species ) .",
    "condensation of ch@xmath9 , nh@xmath6 , h@xmath10o , fe , and mgsio@xmath6 was included using data from various sources , including eisenberg & kauzmann ( 1969 ) , the handbook of chemistry and physics ( 1993 ) , and lange s handbook of chemistry ( 1979 ) .    for t@xmath3s below 1300",
    "k , we assumed that al , ca , ti and v were removed either by condensation or were dissolved in silicate grains at about the mgsio@xmath6 condensation temperature .",
    "these atoms are important because they lead to molecules that are strong light absorbers , such as tio and vo .",
    "however , they have not been detected in the giant planets of our solar system and should nt be present in the atmospheres of relatively cool objects such as the brown dwarf gl229 b ( marley  1996 ) .",
    "figure 5 depicts composition profiles of some of the dominant molecular species found in one of our models of gl229 b. it is clear from just this representative figure that the variation of composition is an important feature of dense , low  temperature atmospheres ( sharp and wasserburg 1995 ) .",
    "we are currently preparing a more comprehensive set of condensation curves for minor species with the egp and brown dwarf atmosphere models of burrows  ( 1997 ) .",
    "the presence of condensed species can radically alter the gas phase composition .",
    "for example , the abundance of h@xmath10s decreases rapidly with temperature due to the formation of the condensate fes . in our theoretical model of gl229 b , fes , and of lesser importance due to the relatively low cosmic abundance of phosphorus , mg@xmath6p@xmath10o@xmath20 , form above the photosphere .",
    "this suggests that clouds containing grains of these species can form in the atmosphere , and possibly play an important role in modifying the emergent flux and in altering the bond albedo .",
    "the more refractory condensates whose condensation points lie well below the photosphere still play an important role in depleting the observed atmosphere of a number of abundant elements , _",
    "e.g. _ , si , mg , ca , and fe .",
    "the direct effect of clouds on the emergent fluxes of egps and brown dwarfs in the important t@xmath3 range below 1300 k has yet to be properly addressed .",
    "however , the presence or absence of clouds strongly affects the reflection albedos of egps and brown dwarfs .",
    "cloud formation depletes a gas  phase absorber from certain regions of the atmosphere ; if this occurs around the photosphere the resulting radiative balance and emergent flux distribution are modified .",
    "because of condensation , we expect that the gaseous water bands will disappear for objects with effective temperature below about 400 k and that ammonia bands will disappear below t@xmath3s of 200 k. we expect the disappearance of silicate or iron features below about 1200 k ( depending , modestly , on surface gravity ) .    beyond predicting where the water and ammonia bands should disappear due to condensation , the spectral and radiative effects of clouds are difficult to quantify .",
    "simple models in which clouds are uniformly distributed over the surface of the egp , and are characterized by a single particle size , fail to take account of atmospheric dynamics which can lead to dramatic changes in the effects of clouds . in particular ,",
    "convective processes lead to growth in the mean particle size , as well as a potentially heterogenous distribution of clouds across the disk of the object . in the case of water and magnesium silicates ,",
    "the latent heat of condensation increases the mean upwelling velocity and can exaggerate these effects , as quantified by lunine  ( 1989 ) .",
    "the simple model of the transport processes in magnesium silicate clouds presented in lunine  suggests particle sizes in the range of 100 microns are possible by coalescence , much larger than the micron ",
    "sized particles one would assume from simple condensation .",
    "the radiative properties of a cloud clearly depend upon the actual particle size , as well as the large  scale cloud morphology ( broken or continuous ) .",
    "it is now clear that silicate grain formation modifies the characteristics of hot brown dwarfs ( @xmath21 ) and late m dwarfs ( @xmath22 ) in ways not fully understood ( lunine  1989 ; allard  1997 ; jones & tsuji 1997 ; tsuji  1996 ) . in particular , the near  infrared and optical colors of the objects newly discovered in the denis survey ( delfosse 1997 ) , the 2mass survey ( kirkpatrick , beichman , & skrutskie 1997 ) , and in the pleiades ( martin , rebolo , & zapatero - osorio 1996 ) deviate from what is currently theoretically predicted by as much as one magnitude .",
    "our group was the first to include silicate grains in calculations of the atmospheres of m and brown dwarfs ( lunine  1986 ; lunine  1989 ) .",
    "however , we produced only very low resolution spectra , and those were solely for the purposes of calculating boundary conditions for the evolutionary calculations , not for the generation of colors and useful spectra for objects above 2000 k. one of our goals for the future is to model the effects of refractory clouds at high t@xmath3s and h@xmath10o and nh@xmath6 clouds at low t@xmath3s on emergent spectra and colors .",
    "our previous theoretical work has led us to certain general conclusions , among which are :    * the opacity due to grains lowers the t@xmath3 , the luminosity , and the mass at the edge of the solar  metallicity hydrogen ",
    "burning main sequence from @xmath42000 k to 1750 k , from 10@xmath23to 6.0@xmath510@xmath24 , and from @xmath40.085  to @xmath40.074  , respectively .",
    "* h@xmath10o , h@xmath10 , and ch@xmath9 dominate the spectrum below t@xmath3@xmath41200 k. for such t@xmath3s , most or all true metals are sequestered below the photosphere . * enhancements and suppressions of the emergent flux relative to black body values can be by many orders of magnitude . *",
    "the infrared colors of egps , brown dwarfs , and m dwarfs are much bluer than the colors previously derived using either the black body assumption or primitive non  gray models . * in some ir colors ( _ e.g. , _ @xmath25 ) ,",
    "a substellar object gets bluer , not redder , with age and for a given age , lower ",
    "mass substellar objects are bluer than higher  mass substellar objects .",
    "* clouds of h@xmath10o and nh@xmath6 are formed for t@xmath3s below @xmath4400 k and @xmath4200 k , respectively .",
    "their formation will affect the colors and spectra of egps and brown dwarfs in ways not yet fully characterized .",
    "the present pace of m dwarf , brown dwarf , and giant planet discovery and nasa s future plans for planet searches suggest that many more objects with t@xmath3s from 200 k to 4000 k will be identified and subject to spectroscopic examination .",
    "we have now developed most of the theoretical tools necessary to support and interpret indirect observations ( radial velocity , astrometry ) , direct detections , and the spectroscopy of the brighter objects .",
    "we will soon be able to reliably predict the spectral and broadband signatures of those objects that have not been directly detected , and constrain the atmospheric composition and thermal structure of those for which we do have color or spectroscopic information .",
    "it is important to note that there is still considerable room for improvement in the modeling of substellar objects .",
    "the direct effects of grains and clouds for t@xmath3s from 2000 k to 100 k has yet to be properly included and , in particular , should mute the extreme suppressions we see due to the h@xmath10o bands . in our recent work",
    ", we generated low ",
    "resolution spectra ; higher  resolution spectra are necessary to obtain more accurate colors ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the effect of metallicity has yet to be explored and promises to bring many surprises .",
    "some opacity databases , especially that for ch@xmath9 , are inadequate and bear directly upon the detectability and colors of egps .",
    "all in all , giant planet and brown dwarf theory should be a quite lively arena in the years ahead .",

    "in addition , the luminosity of such a 70 myr brown dwarf is an order of magnitude lower than that of a coeval object destined to ignite hydrogen stably .",

    "brown dwarfs in isolation are almost completely convective ; the outer radiative zones might comprise only 10@xmath31 % by mass of the object .",
    "however , as guillot  ( 1995 ) have shown , jupiter itself may have an inner radiative zone near 1500 k that can confuse the entropy mapping between core and atmosphere .",
    "we see the same effect in brown dwarfs and i refer you to our recent paper ( burrows  1997 ) for a more detailed discussion of this important point . being convective , brown dwarfs should have magnetic fields and be active , though their luminosties are low and their convective velocities are correspondingly low ( @xmath32 ) .",

    "mass objects are generally larger .",
    "younger objects may still be contracting on their hayashi tracks and , hence , can also be larger than after they achieve equilibrium , but the radii of objects greater than one jupiter mass are less than 2 within 10@xmath33 yrs .",
    "there are some interesting exceptions , but these are good general rules ; the effect is generally small .",
    "foing you showed the high potential of ir searches for isolated brown dwarfs .",
    "what strategies do you recommend for brown dwarfs companions , in order to discriminate them spatially or spectroscopically from the primary star ?",
    "adam burrows the best long  term means of discriminating a brown dwarf or a planet from its primary are adaptive optics and interferometry in the near to mid ",

    "<S> since october of 1995 , employing doppler spectroscopy astronomers have discovered as many as 20 giant planets and brown dwarfs , including companions to @xmath0 boo , 51 peg , @xmath1 and , 55 cnc , @xmath2 crb , 70 vir , 16 cyg b , and 47 uma . </S>",
    "<S> these discoveries have galvanized the planetary science community , astronomers , and the public at large . within hours of the announcement of the planet 51 peg b , </S>",
    "<S> the first _ </S>",
    "<S> direct _ detection of an unimpeachable brown dwarf , gl229 b , was also announced . </S>",
    "<S> gl229 b is a watershed since it has methane spectral features and a surface temperature below 1000 kelvin , characteristics unique to objects with substellar masses .    during the last two years , building upon our previous experience in the modeling of brown dwarfs and m stars , we published theoretical studies of the evolution and spectra of extrasolar giant planets . </S>",
    "<S> we have recently upgraded our capabilities and now generate _ non  gray _ spectral and color models of both giant planets and brown dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> this theory will soon encompass objects whose effective temperatures range from 100 k to 4000 k and whose masses span three orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the evolutionary , spectral , and color calculations upon which we have embarked are in direct support of the searches now being planned in earnest with the hst ( wfpc2 , nicmos ) , the irtf , the mmt 6.5-meter upgrade , the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) , keck s i and ii , iso , ukirt , ngst , the vlt , corot , denis , 2mass , and sirtf . </S>"
