    "the existing theoretical models based mainly on the partonic picture of the hadronic interactions are definitely invalid for @xmath3 annihilation at low energies . due to this fact we used experimental data as for evaluation of the annihilation cross section as well as for the simulation of the final state and secondaries distribution .",
    "the annihilation cross section is the difference between total and inelastic ones @xmath4 .",
    "as it follows from data the dependence @xmath5 is valid already for laboratory antiproton momenta @xmath6 mev / c .",
    "thus , at @xmath7 we used data from @xcite for the total and elastic cross sections and at momenta lesser than @xmath8 mev we used the dependence    _ ann(p<300  )  =  _ 0  c(v^*)/v^ *   ,    and    _ el  =  const     the additional coulomb factor @xmath9 gives large increase for the annihilation cross section at small velocities of the antiproton and is defined by the expression @xcite :    c(v^ * )  =  ,    where , @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being the fine structure constant and @xmath12 being the speed of light and @xmath13 is the velocity of the antiproton in the center - of - mass @xmath3 system .",
    "we used the experimental data on the @xmath3 annihilation cross section @xcite to normalize the @xmath14 behaviour and the coulomb factor , choosing :    _ 0  =  _ ann^exp(p=300  )  160  .",
    "we used the experimental data @xcite on the @xmath3 annihilation at rest to simulate the distribution of the final state particles , see table .    in practice ,",
    "the approximation of the annihilation at rest is valid with very good accuracy up to laboratory momentum of the incoming antiprotons about @xmath15 gev because at this laboratory momentum the kinetic energy of the antiproton is still order of magnitude lesser than the twice antiproton mass .",
    "the average number of @xmath16 s per annihilation is    n _",
    "=  3.930.24 .",
    "the simulation of the distributions of final state particles has been performed according to phase space in the center - of - mass of the @xmath3 system .",
    "after that pythia 6.127 package @xcite has been used to perform the decays of all unstable and quasi  stable particles .",
    "we used the spherical model for halo and parametrized the density distribution of interstellar hydrogen gas along the @xmath17 direction ( to north pole ) as :    n_h(z )  =  n_h^halo+ ,    where @xmath18 @xmath19 is the hydrogen number density in the halo , @xmath20 @xmath19 is the hydrogen number density in the disc and @xmath21 pc is the half - width of the gaseous disc .",
    "the number of gammas arriving from the given direction is defined by the well known expression :    j_(e )  =  _ 0^ldl(e , r , z ) .",
    "here @xmath22 is the density of gamma source along the observation direction @xmath23 in suggestion of the isotropic distribution of the gamma source .",
    "the integration must be performed up to the edge of the halo @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the cosine of the line - of - sight to the @xmath26 axis .",
    "the flux of the antiprotons has been chosen similar to the standard proton flux :    j_|p(e_kin )  =  n_tot()^2.7 ,    where @xmath27 is the dimensionless antiproton velocity .",
    "the minimal kinetic energy of the antiprotons has been chosen equal to the velocity dispersion in the galaxy , @xmath28 km / s , i.e. ,    e_kin^min  500  .",
    "fig.[gmflux](a , b ) demonstrates the resulting differential gamma distribution in the galactic north pole direction in comparison with egret data @xcite in the range @xmath29 mev .",
    "the peak of @xmath30 decay is clearly seen both in calculations as well as in experimental distributions .",
    "fig.[gmflux](c ) shows the charged multiplicity distribution in the annihilation model described above .",
    "experimental points have been taken from @xcite .    at this choice",
    "the necessary integral number density of the antiprotons @xmath31 is :    n_tot  =  _ e_min^  ~  10 ^ -13  ^-3 .",
    "note here , that within reasonable variation of the index of the antiproton flux the integral number of the antiprotons does not varies significantly .",
    "this is due to the fact that the main contribution comes from the @xmath3 annihilation at the lowest velocity of the antiprotons .",
    "if we choose the minimal velocity of antiprotons according the velocity of the stellar wind , @xmath32 km / s , the necessary antiproton number density must be increased by order of magnitude and is @xmath33 @xmath19 .",
    "this number also does not contradict to any theoretical or experimental limits on relative amount of the antimatter .",
    "we considered the stationary case , provided by the presence of a permanent source of the antimatter .",
    "assume @xcite that antimatter stars in the galaxy form globular cluster , moving along elliptical orbit in the halo .",
    "in the first approximation the integral effect we study depends on the total mass of the antimatter stars in the galaxy and it does not depend on the amount of globular clusters .",
    "the main contribution into galactic gamma radiation comes from the antimatter lost by the cluster and spread over the galaxy .",
    "there are two main mechanisms of antimatter loss by the cluster .",
    "the first one is the stationary mass loss by antimatter stars in the form of stellar wind .",
    "the second mechanism is the antimatter supernova explosions . in both cases",
    "the antimatter is spread over the galaxy in the form of positrons and antinuclei . due to",
    "traveling in the halo magnetic fields the emitted antiprotons fill the whole halo and one can consider their number density to be constant over the halo .    to evaluate the confinement time for the antiprotons in the galaxy we used the results of the  two  zone  leaky box model @xcite .",
    "as the confinement time enters as a common factor in the predicted @xmath3 ratio @xcite , we can find the necessary factor , performing the fit of the normalization to the experimental data .",
    "we removed from the fit two the most left points , strongly affected by the heliosphere @xcite .",
    "solid curve in fig.[expfit](a ) presents the lbm predictions for the @xmath3 ratio , multiplied by the fitted factor @xmath34 , which factor increases the confinement time for slow antiprotons in the galaxy up to @xmath35 years .",
    "dashed curve is the phenomenological fit in the form @xmath36 .",
    "experimental points have been taken from @xcite where references on the data can be found .",
    "fig.[expfit ] shows also the time of life of the antiprotons in the disc ( b ) and the free pass length of the antiprotons in the disc ( c ) versus antiproton kinetic energy .",
    "the correspondent curves for halo can be easily obtained if one reduces the hydrogen number density by two - three orders of magnitude according to @xmath37 number density in the halo .",
    "note here that the presented in fig.[expfit ] confinement time for very slow antiprotons has been extrapolated to small kinetic energies , suggesting that @xmath38 and is , in fact , the lower limit for the confinement time .    from fig.[expfit](b )",
    "we can conclude that confinement time for low - energy antiprotons in the halo and in the gaseous disc is much greater than their life time with respect to the annihilation .",
    "therefore we can consider the picture as a stationary one . from fig.[expfit](c ) we see , that free pass length of the slowest antiprotons is lesser than the half - width of the disc and we can observe the products of the annihilation only but not the original antiprotons .",
    "the detailed analysis of the antimatter annihilation mechanism for galactic diffuse gamma flux in the terms of antimatter globular cluster and the estimation of the total amount of antimatter stars and the expected antihelium flux for this case will be considered in the successive paper .    .",
    "the authors acknowledge the cosmion seminar participants for useful discussions .",
    "the work was partially supported by section  cosmoparticle physics  of state scientific technical programme  astronomy . fundamental space research  and performed in the framework of cosmion  ethz and ams  epicos collaborations of astrodamus project .",
