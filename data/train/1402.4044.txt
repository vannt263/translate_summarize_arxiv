    "a fundamental and still unresolved problem in the understanding of astronomical photoionized plasmas , particularly regions and planetary nebulae , is the systematic higher metal abundances derived from recombination lines ( rl ) relative to those from collisionally excited lines ( cel ) .",
    "the magnitude of these discrepancies varies from a few percent up to puzzling factors as large as 70 ( see , for instance , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several plausible explanations have been proposed to account for their cause , among them temperature fluctuations @xcite , hydrogen deficient inclusions @xcite , and dense clumps ionized by x rays @xcite .",
    "however , all these hypotheses present certain limitations and no conclusive evidence has been put forward to either prove or dispute them .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the apparent temperature variations in nebular plasmas are the result of electron velocity distributions that deviate from the generally assumed maxwell  boltzmann ( mb ) , proposing the @xmath0  distribution as a more functional alternative .",
    "it is therein argued that excitation rates sufficiently boosted from the mb values are obtained with @xmath6 , implying that the traditional temperature diagnostics from forbidden line ratios systematically overestimate the true kinetic temperature ; therefore , ion abundances derived from cel would be underestimated . in their analysis ,",
    "two crucial approximations are made : ( i ) electron impact collision strengths are constant with energy , which in practice is not the case due to strong resonance contributions ; and ( ii ) the effects of the @xmath0  distribution on the de - excitation rate coefficients are ignored .",
    "@xcite have found that the temperatures from cel are consistently higher than those of in an extensive group of both galactic and extragalatic regions with gas metallicities higher than 0.2 solar . among the causes for this excess ,",
    "the @xmath0  distribution has again been invoked .",
    "@xcite have continued their work on the @xmath0  distributions by revising the effects of different datasets of effective collision strengths on the electron temperatures obtained from nebular diagnostics such as [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] . in particular , by comparing the electron temperature obtained using recent collision strengths @xcite with those derived from earlier datasets , they have concluded that the previous electron temperatures have been seriously overestimated . since any spectroscopic evidence of non - maxwellian electron distributions",
    "must rely on accurate atomic data , it is indispensable to verify this claim",
    ". it must be added that @xcite did not consider the accuracy of the radiative rates ( @xmath1-values ) which is also a source of uncertainty in spectral diagnostics . for a full treatment of the propagation of atomic data uncertainties in spectral diagnostics ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite have made an effort to estimate both mb and @xmath0-averaged collisional rates from energy tabulations of raw collision strengths , and stress the need for a systematic inventory and assessment of the newer atomic data and their effects on photoionization models before really establishing the prevalence of the @xmath0  distribution in nebular plasmas .",
    "this is in fact the main motive of the present work .",
    "we make use of the familiar nebular diagnostics ",
    "namely [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] to search for evidence of @xmath0  distributions in well - observed regions . in section  [ rates ] we describe the effects of the @xmath0  distribution on both the electron excitation and de - excitation rate coefficients for forbidden transitions .",
    "since energy - tabulated electron collision strengths with at least a similar degree of reliability are required in this analysis , we decided to recalculate them from scratch ( section  [ upsilon ] ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the electron temperature to the @xmath1-values is also evaluated in section  [ aval ] . with the new data , we derive in section  [ h2temp ] electron temperatures for the regions studied by @xcite and",
    "compare them with those obtained with representative effective collision strengths published in the past two decades .",
    "the possibilities of the @xmath0  distribution in reducing cel temperatures and in conciliating the temperature differences in plasma regions are also investigated ( section  [ kappaeffects ] ) .",
    "conclusions are finally discussed in section  [ summary ] .",
    "spectral emission of non - maxwellian plasmas has been studied in detail by @xcite from which we recapitulate the formalism for electron impact excitation and de - excitation within the @xmath0-distribution framework . for an ionic transition between levels",
    "@xmath7 induced by electron impact , the excitation and de - excitation generalized rate coefficients may be written as @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the energy separation between the two levels and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are their respective statistical weights .",
    "the other quantities are the standard fine structure constant , @xmath13 , speed of light , @xmath14 , bohr radius , @xmath15 , rydberg constant , @xmath16 , and boltzmann constant , @xmath17 . for a particular normalized electron - energy distribution function @xmath18",
    ", the kinetic temperature @xmath19 is defined in terms of the mean energy @xmath20 the effective collision strengths for excitation , @xmath21 , and de - excitation , @xmath22 , involve energy averages over the quantum mechanical cross section @xmath23 for the transition , which may be conveniently expressed in terms of the symmetric collision strength @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the free - electron energies relative to the @xmath27th and @xmath28th levels , respectively .",
    "they are then expressed through the integrals @xmath29 and @xmath30    for the mb electron distribution @xmath31 @xmath32 becomes the familiar electron temperature @xmath3 and the effective collision strengths for excitation and de - excitation are also symmetric @xmath33 an unmistakeable signature of detailed balance for this distribution .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath0  distribution of electron energies @xmath34 has a characteristic energy @xmath35 that is related to the kinetic temperature @xmath36 where the @xmath0 parameter ( @xmath37 ) gives a measure of the deviation from the mb distribution , converging to the latter as @xmath38 .",
    "detailed balance is now broken and the asymmetric effective collision strengths are given by @xmath39 and @xmath40    in figure  [ ratio_kappa ] , the ratio @xmath41 is plotted as a function of @xmath0 for the forbidden transitions arising from the ground states of and .",
    "it may be seen that the @xmath0  distribution increases the de - excitation effective collision strength by up to a factor of two for @xmath42 , while for higher @xmath0 the enhancements are marginal . for excitation ,",
    "the @xmath0  distribution causes large differences for @xmath42 , in particular increments as large as a factor of six for the transitions with the larger @xmath10 ; for such transitions , they remain sizeable ( @xmath43% ) even for @xmath44 .",
    "the behavior of this ratio with temperature in is depicted in figure  [ ratio_temp ] , where it may be appreciated that , for de - excitation , the ratio is temperature independent and not larger than 10% ; for excitation , on the other hand , exponential increases are found with decreasing temperature for @xmath45  k especially for the transition @xmath46 due to its comparatively larger @xmath10 . in figure",
    "[ o3_line_ratio ] , the [ ] @xmath47 line ratio is plotted as a function of temperature for both the mb and @xmath0 distributions at an electron density of @xmath48  @xmath49 .",
    "it is therein shown that , for an observed line ratio of 200 say , mb results in @xmath50  k while the @xmath0  distribution gives significantly lower values : @xmath51  k and @xmath52  k for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "these findings are in general agreement with @xcite , and support their approximation of neglecting the contributions of the @xmath0  distribution to the de - excitation rate coefficient .",
    "regarding their assumption of estimating the @xmath0-averaged excitation rate coefficient with a constant collision strength , we have found that a better choice would be to derive it from the mb temperature - dependent effective collision strength for the transition through a simplified version of equation  ( [ kappa_excitation ] ) , namely @xmath55 which can be integrated analytically to give @xmath56 equation  ( [ approx_kappa ] ) is a small yet significant improvement over equation  ( 16 ) in @xcite inasmuch as now the mb effective collision strength @xmath57 is temperature dependent rather than constant , and enables the accurate determination of @xmath0-averaged excitation rate coefficients ( better than 10% for @xmath5 ) from temperature tabulations of the mb effective collision strengths .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned in @xcite , the key term in equation  ( [ approx_kappa ] ) is @xmath58 , the ratio of the kinetic temperature relative to the excitation temperature @xmath59 , since @xmath0-distribution enhancements to the excitation rate coefficient become conspicuous for @xmath60 .",
    "hence , ir transitions within the ionic ground term , where usually @xmath61  k , are not expected to show noticeable departures from mb conditions in nebular plasmas .",
    "the optical diagnostics we study in the present work are those widely used in observational work to determine nebular plasma properties  namely [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] the specific line ratios being listed in table  [ lineratios ] . since the collision strengths for these transitions are not readily available from the original sources , and the present analysis requires at least an even degree of reliability , we had no alterative but to recalculate them .",

    "when computing effective collision strengths for both the mb and @xmath0 distributions used in figures  [ ratio_kappa][ratio_temp ] , it is important to take into account that the collision strengths for forbidden transitions are dominated by dense packs of resonances in the region near the excitation threshold ; therefore , it is the mesh between @xmath65 ( threshold ) and @xmath66  ryd that determines their value at typical nebular temperatures ( @xmath67  k ) .    in the present work ,",

    "are obtained by means of the intermediate coupling frame transformation ( icft ) method of @xcite using energy meshes with a resolution of @xmath70  ryd for most ions except where a finer step of @xmath71  ryd was required .",

    "the ionic targets are specified in table  [ targets ] and will be henceforth briefly described ( sections  [ n2][ar3 ] ) .",
    "the resulting effective collision strengths are also compared with other representative datasets in order to estimate their accuracy . in this respect , since one - to - one comparisons are usually hindered by the diverse temperature tabulations found in publication , a useful measure ( see table  [ ups ] ) is the scatter of the effective collision strengths at @xmath72  k for the leading transitions that populate the diagnostic upper levels ( this temperature , representative of the order of nebular temperatures , is always given ) . as shown in table  [ ups ] , the mean dispersions are not greater than 15% .

    "the present scheme is similar to that by @xcite , but our ic collision strengths are obtained with the icft method based on multi - channel quantum defect theory @xcite .",
    "the agreement with @xcite is in general within 10% except for the @xmath75 transition at the lower temperatures ( @xmath76  k ) where larger discrepancies are found ( see fig .  [ n2_ups ] ) .",

    "nonetheless , the discrepancies for the @xmath79 transitions have little impact on the optical emission spectra of typical nebulae since the fine - structure levels within the ground multiplet are nearly thermalized at electron densities of @xmath80  @xmath49 and temperatures of @xmath67  k , while the optical transitions arising from the first and second excited terms are dominated by excitations from the ground multiplet .

    "if multi - region plasmas are indeed in evidence , the observed diagnostic temperature variation in our sample might be resolved by @xmath0  distributions only in the low - excitation region , thus leading to a single lower temperature for diagnostics such as [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] with the consequent abundance enhancements .",
    "however , even in these cases the differences between observed line ratios and the predictions of the mb distribution differ by less than @xmath145 if proper uncertainties are taken into account . in the high - excitation region , on the other hand , diagnostic temperature differences in [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] do not seem to be reconciled by invoking @xmath0  distributions , which then leaves the problem open to other unaccounted physical processes .",
    "it must be emphasized that these findings are not the rule as indicated by the extensive sample by @xcite of regions with mostly higher temperature ( @xmath146  k ) ; thus further detailed work would be required before @xmath0 distributions can be firmly established .",
    "regarding the effects of the @xmath0  distribution on the collisional rate coefficients , we have confirmed the reliability of their neglect for de - excitation , and an accurate ( better than 10% ) analytic expression has been derived to readily estimate @xmath0-averaged rates for excitation from temperature tabulations of mb effective collision strengths . the measure that regulates level - excitation departures from mb is @xmath60 ; hence , for ir transitions within the ionic ground terms with very low excitation energies ( @xmath147  k ) , the mb and @xmath0-distribution electron impact excitation rates are essentially identical at nebular temperatures .",
    "ir abundance discrepancies with respect to the optical would then be a further indication of the relevance of @xmath0  distributions .",
    "however , such discrepancies have not been reported ; for instance , all planetary nebulae observed with _ iso _ show consistent abundances as estimated from both ir and optical cel @xcite , which then suggests that the mb distribution dominates .    in the present work it has been demonstrated that error - margin capping in the collisional data relevant to nebular diagnostic implies ",
    "apart from detailed comparisons with previous datasets and in some cases recalculations  comprehensive benchmarks with spectral models and observations , and this is a task we intend to pursue in the ongoing discussion concerning the cel  rl abundance discrepancies .",
    "we would like to thank christophe morisset , instituto de astronoma , unam , mexico , for sending us the temperature diagnostics for the region sample by @xcite .",
    "we are also indebted to grazyna stasiska , observatoire de paris , france , for useful discussions regarding several aspects of the paper .",

    "<S> the classic optical nebular diagnostics [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] are employed to search for evidence of non - maxwellian electron distributions , namely @xmath0  distributions , in a sample of well - observed galactic regions . by computing new effective collision strengths for all these systems and @xmath1-values </S>",
    "<S> when necessary ( e.g. ) , and by comparing with previous collisional and radiative datasets , we have been able to obtain realistic estimates of the electron - temperature dispersion caused by the atomic data , which in most cases are not larger than @xmath2% . </S>",
    "<S> if the uncertainties due to both observation and atomic data are then taken into account , it is plausible to determine for some nebulae a representative average temperature while in others there are at least two plasma excitation regions . for the latter </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the diagnostic temperature differences in the high - excitation region , e.g. @xmath3 ( ) , @xmath3 ( ) , and @xmath3 ( ) , can not be conciliated by invoking @xmath0  distributions . </S>",
    "<S> for the low excitation region , it is possible in some , but not all , cases to arrive at a common , lower temperature for [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] with @xmath4 , which would then lead to significant abundance enhancements for these ions . </S>",
    "<S> an analytic formula is proposed to generate accurate @xmath0-averaged excitation rate coefficients ( better than 10% for @xmath5 ) from temperature tabulations of the maxwell  boltzmann effective collision strengths . </S>"
