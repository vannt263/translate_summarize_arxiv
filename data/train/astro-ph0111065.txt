    "asca observations of the sgr b2 giant molecular cloud revealed very hard x  ray spectrum with a very prominent iron fluorescent line at 6.4 kev ( koyama et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "this discovery provided an important confirmation of the hypothesis of sunyaev , markevitch and pavlinsky ( 1993 ) that the diffuse emission from the giant molecular clouds in the galactic centre region is at least partly due to reprocessed emission of a powerful x  ray flare from the supermassive black hole sgr a*. the geometry of the problem suggests that such flare could have happened few hundred years ago .",
    "the morphology and the spectrum of the reprocessed emission have been modeled by sunyaev & churazov 1998 and murakami et al .",
    "recent sax ( sidoli et al . , 2001 ) and chandra data ( murakami , koyama , maeda 2001a ) are broadly consistent with the assumption that reprocessed ( reflected ) emission is due to the past flare from sgr a*. main observational arguments in favor of this interpretation are :    * remarkably hard shape of the sgr b2 x  ray spectrum * extremely high flux in the neutral iron fluorescent line at 6.4 kev ( equivalent width @xmath012 kev ) . * the side of the cloud towards sgr a * is brighter in x",
    " rays than the opposite side .",
    "we argue below that the most convincing test of the origin of the diffuse x  ray emission from the sgr b2 cloud would be a detection of polarized emission from this object .",
    "recent progress in the development of the x  ray polarimeters for space missions ( costa et al . ,",
    "2001 ) implies a drastic increase of the detector sensitivity and makes the sgr b2 cloud a natural target for the polarimetric studies .",
    "we consider a uniform cloud with the radius of 10 pc and the thomson optical depth of 0.5 exposed to the hard ( power law photon index @xmath1 ) unpolarized x ",
    "ray radiation from an external source . as we argue below the particular values of the cloud size and its optical depth",
    "do not strongly affect the degree of the polarization of the reprocessed / reflected emission .",
    "the external source was assumed to be steady on the time scales comparable with the light crossing time of the cloud ( the morphology of the reprocessed emission from the cloud illuminated by a short flare is considered in sunyaev & churazov 1998 ) .",
    "the cloud consists of hydrogen ( in molecular form ) , helium and admixture of heavy elements with the solar abundance .",
    "the reprocessed radiation was calculated via monte ",
    "carlo method .",
    "the following three processes have been taken into account : i ) photoelectric absorption , ii ) compton scattering by bound electrons and iii ) fluorescent emission of heavy elements .",
    "the cross sections for compton scattering by electrons in hydrogen molecules and helium atoms were taken from sunyaev & churazov 1996 , vainshtein , sunyaev & churazov 1998 and sunyaev , uskov & churazov 1999 .",
    "the fluorescent yields and the energies of the fluorescent lines were taken from kaastra & mewe 1993 .",
    "in particular case of the sgr b2 cloud ( as a reflection nebula ) and sgr a * ( as an external source ) the projected distance of @xmath0100 pc is known .",
    "the cloud was assumed to be located at the same distance as sgr a * and outgoing photons , used for calculating degree of polarization , were accumulated over small solid angle towards the observer s direction . the resulting spectrum and the degree of polarization",
    "are shown in fig.[sp ] .",
    "for comparison the energy spectrum and the degree of polarization have been calculated for the case when scattering cloud is located at the same projected distance , but further 100 pc away from the observer than the illuminating source ( fig.[sp135 ] ) .",
    "the spectra shown in fig.[sp ] and [ sp135 ] have a typical `` reflection '' shape of the continuum and a set of strong fluorescent lines of the astrophysically abundant elements like s , ar , ca , fe and ni . at low energies ( below @xmath07 kev ) the shape of the continuum emission",
    "is determined by the ratio of the scattering cross section to the photoabsorption cross section . due to the coherent scattering by the electrons bound in hydrogen molecules and helium atoms",
    "the scattered continuum is higher ( by a factor of 2 at lowest energies ) than the reflected continuum calculated for free electrons .",
    "the `` compton shoulders '' on the red side of the strong lines are smooth and do not show sharp features typical for scattering by the free cold electrons ( sunyaev and churazov 1996 ) . for the iron 6.4 kev line the flux in the shoulder is @xmath01020 % of the line flux .",
    "additional modification of the spectra shown in fig.[sp ] and [ sp135 ] should be due to interstellar absorption along the line of sight .",
    "for the hydrogen column densities typical for the galactic centre region ( i.e. @xmath2 of @xmath3 ) the emission below 4 - 5 kev will be strongly suppressed .      as is clear from fig.[sp ]",
    "the continuum emission is strongly polarized , while the emission in the fluorescent lines is not .",
    "this is of course a natural result given the geometry of the problem . for the neutral ( or molecular ) gas with solar abundance of heavy elements",
    "the first scattering gives the dominant contribution to the reflected continuum at energies below @xmath07 kev . for a thomson thick cloud the contribution from second scattering",
    "is attenuated by a factor @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the thomson cross section and @xmath6 is the photoelectric cross section at given energy @xmath7 . for a cloud with a very small optical depth @xmath8 the suppression factor for second scattering",
    "is @xmath9 .",
    "therefore contribution of second scattering is almost always modest ( at least at low energies ) and reasonable estimate of the degree of polarization can be made under single scattering approximation .",
    "the scattering cross section is proportional to the factor @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the polarization vectors of the photon before and after the scattering .",
    "since the angular size of the reflecting cloud ( as seen from the illuminating source ) is small then the degree of polarization @xmath13 is related to the scattering angle @xmath14 via well known expression : @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "in particular case of the scattering by @xmath090simulated above ( fig.[sp ] ) , the degree of polarization should be close to unity .",
    "the deviation of the degree of polarization from unity in simulations is caused mainly by the contribution of the second and subsequent scatterings to the total spectrum .",
    "for the second simulation ( fig.[sp135 ] ) the scattering angle is around 135and the degree of polarization is close to 33% in agreement with the expression ( [ pol ] ) for rayleigh law of scattering .    using again the argument that the angular size of the cloud ( as seen from the primary source ) is relatively small one can treat the incident radiation as a narrow unpolarized beam and get simple estimate ( see appendix ) of the degree of polarization for photons experienced two or more scatterings : @xmath17^{n-1}-1 ) } } , \\label{poln}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the number of scatterings . from this equation",
    "it is clear that the degree of polarization rather slowly decreases with the increase of the number of scatterings",
    ". therefore even although the degree of polarization decreases with energy ( see fig.[sp ] ) due to increasing contribution from multiple scatterings , the reflected continuum radiation remains nevertheless strongly polarized at all energies .",
    "the direction of polarization remains the same ( perpendicular to the direction from the primary source to the cloud ) after any number of scatterings .",
    "fluorescent photons , which are born inside the cloud and are emitted isotropically should not be polarized as indeed seen in the simulations .",
    "the compton shoulder of the fluorescent lines can be polarized for some specific geometries of the scattering clouds .",
    "e.g. for an optically thin , strongly elongated cloud ( in the direction perpendicular to the line of sight ) the shoulder can be strongly polarized .",
    "but in simple cases like considered here the shoulder can be polarized only weakly ( compared to the continuum ) .",
    "thus sensitive polarimetric observations of the sgr b2 cloud should reveal strongly polarized continuum and unpolarized fluorescent lines .",
    "the polarization direction must be perpendicular to the direction from the reflection nebula towards the primary source .",
    "actual degree of polarization is a function of the scattering angle and therefore can be used to infer the mutual location of the sgr b2 cloud and the sgr a * source along the line of sight . for sgr b2 cloud the total continuum flux in the 4 - 10 kev band is 1.52 @xmath19 as observed by asca . for a 4% efficient detector",
    "( see costa et al . ,",
    "2001 ) placed under @xmath0 1000 @xmath20 effective area mirror this source would yield about @xmath21 in polarized flux . therefore ( assuming that the detector background can be neglected ) a significant detection can be achieved in few @xmath22 s. the sgr b2 is not the only object which is suspected to be the `` reflection nebula '' .",
    "murakami et al .",
    ", 2001b found strong fluorescent line emission from another rich molecular complex ",
    "sgr c. as argued by sunyaev , markevitch , & pavlinsky ( 1993 ) and cramphorn & sunyaev ( 2001 ) many other reflection sites could contribute to the diffuse emission in the galactic centre region and the galactic ridge .",
    "x  ray polarimetric studies would then allow one to reconstruct real 3-dimensional positions of the scattering clouds .",
    "note however that ( in the first scattering approximation ) the degree of polarization is the same for the scattering angles of @xmath14 and @xmath23 , which correspond to the cloud shifted with respect to the primary source towards or away from the observer by the same distance . in order",
    "to break this degeneracy one have to use detailed information on shape of the reflected continuum at low energies . for smaller scattering angles ( the scattering cloud is closer to the observer than the primary source ) the more distant side of the cloud is exposed to primary radiation and photoabsorption should suppress the reprocessed radiation at low energies .",
    "more confusing can be the case when the emission of the primary source is already polarized .",
    "for example this can be sgr a * jet x  ray emission or emission from hot optically thin quasi - flat accretion disk ( sunyaev & titarchuk , 1985 ) .",
    "the incident light is assumed to consist of unpolarized component with the intensity @xmath24 and the polarized component with the intensity @xmath25 .",
    "the degree of polarization of the initial radiation is thus : @xmath26 .",
    "the degree of polarization @xmath13 of the scattered continuum radiation ( in the one scattering approximation ) can then be easily calculated : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the angle between the direction of polarization of the primary radiation and the perpendicular to the scattering plane .",
    "this would make the determination of the cloud position with respect to the primary source more complicated .",
    "however the continuum radiation will remain polarized in majority of cases and therefore the hypothesis of the sgr b2 as the `` reflection nebula '' can still be tested with the polarimetric observations .",
    "polarization of the incident radiation will also affect shape of the continuum spectrum because it will modify the contributions of single and multiple scattered photons to the total spectra .",
    "the equivalent width of the fluorescent lines will also change .",
    "e.g. consider the single scattering approximation for the 90scattering .",
    "for the completely polarized primary radiation the scattered continuum will be attenuated by a factor @xmath29 , while the intensity of the fluorescent line will not be affected .",
    "thus the equivalent width of the line is : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the equivalent width of the line in the case of unpolarized primary radiation .",
    "therefore when the direction of the primary radiation polarization is in the scattering plane the contribution from the first scattering to the continuum spectrum is zero and the equivalent width of the iron line will be much larger than for unpolarized primary radiation . in reality presence of unpolarized component in the primary radiation and contribution from multiple scatterings",
    "will limit the maximal value of the equivalent width .",
    "finally we note that if the x  ray flare from the sgr a * source was short compared to the light crossing time of the sgr b2 cloud ( see sunyaev & churazov 1998 ) then the time delay for photons undergoing two or more scatterings has to be taken into account when calculating the energy spectrum and the degree of polarization . in the first scattering approximation",
    "the results are unchanged : the continuum is polarized in accordance with the scattering angle and the flux in the fluorescent lines is completely unpolarized .",

    "the change of the polarization after additional one scattering is then governed by the simple transformation ( e.g. chandrasekhar , 1950 ) : @xmath36 the initial values of @xmath37 for a narrow beam of unpolarized light are obviousely : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a dirac function . from ( [ ach ] )",
