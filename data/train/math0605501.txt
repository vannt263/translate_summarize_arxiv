    "the purpose of this article is to construct a continuous piecewise linear map @xmath1 on @xmath2 $ ] such that the coupled map lattice ( cml ) @xmath3 ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) defined by @xmath6 ( @xmath7 are the canonical unit vectors in @xmath8 ) has a phase transition in the following sense : there are @xmath9 such that    * for @xmath10 the infinite system and also the finite ones have a unique invariant probability measure with absolutely continuous finite - dimensional conditional marginals ( so the measure is absolutely continuous if @xmath8 is finite ) , * for @xmath11 the infinite system has at least two such invariant probability measures while the finite systems still have a unique absolutely continuous invariant probability measure .    using the notations",
    "@xmath12 we can write @xmath13 , and as @xmath14 , it is equivalent to study instead of @xmath15 the system @xmath16    in order to state our results we adopt the notation of @xcite : let @xmath17 and let @xmath18 be the set of signed borel measures on @xmath19 .. ] we need to introduce the concept of _ measures of bounded variation_. for @xmath20 let @xmath21 here @xmath22 denotes the partial derivative with respect to @xmath23 .",

    "] it is easy to prove that the set @xmath25 consists of measures whose finite dimensional marginals are absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue and the density is a function of bounded variation @xcite .",
    "in addition , such measures have finite entropy density with respect to lebesgue ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 4.1 ) .",
    "in fact , `` @xmath26 '' is a norm and , with this norm , @xmath27 is a banach space .",
    "remark that for finite @xmath8 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes lebesgue measure on @xmath30 , @xmath31 is just @xmath32 in the sense of functions of bounded variation .",
    "our main result is    [ theo : main ] with the piecewise linear map @xmath1 we propose in section [ sec : local - map ] , the system @xmath33 has the following properties : there are @xmath9 such that the following hold :    a.

    "assertions [ theo : main - a ] ) and [ theo : main - b ] ) follow rather directly from known results , essentially from @xcite and @xcite , respectively . for the proof of assertion [ theo : main - c ] ) we rely heavily on the construction of a phase transition in toom s probabilistic cellular automaton ( pca ) as presented in @xcite .",
    "the idea to link the dynamics of a cml to those of a pca was introduced by gielis and mackay in @xcite where they construct cmls with simple piecewise linear markov maps as local units and with discrete couplings in such a way that their dynamics are isomorphic to those of certain pcas .",
    "this is definitively not the case in our model because we use a `` traditional '' directed nearest neighbour coupling , and so a number of additional arguments are necessary to link our cml to a pca of toom s type .",
    "these arguments are provided in sections  [ sec : global - coupling ] and  [ sec : exp - estimate ] . on the other hand",
    "our local map @xmath1 has a very large number of monotone branches so that it acts nearly as an instantaneous local random generator unlike the rather simple local maps for which boldrighini et al @xcite exhibited phase transitions numerically even in a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "( see also earlier references given in that paper or in @xcite . )",
    "we fix some further notation : for @xmath41 let @xmath42 be the @xmath43-algebra on @xmath19 generated by the coordinates @xmath23 , @xmath44 .",
    "a.   the probability measure @xmath45 on @xmath19 belongs to the class @xmath46 if it has absolutely continuous finite - dimensional marginal distributions , _",
    "i.e._if , for each finite @xmath47 , the projection of @xmath45 to @xmath48 is absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure on @xmath48 .",
    "b.   the probability measure @xmath45 on @xmath19 belongs to the class @xmath49 if , for each finite @xmath47 , @xmath45 has an @xmath50-measurable family of conditional probability distributions on @xmath48 which are all absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure on @xmath48 . c.   by @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 we denote the @xmath35-invariant measures in @xmath27 , @xmath46 , and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "we have the following two inclusions : @xmath54 the second one is obvious , the first one was proved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4 ) . in our particular setting of",
    "one - sided directed couplings even more is known .",
    "the invariant measures belong to @xmath49 , namely : @xmath55 see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2(a ) ) .",
    "it follows that the unique invariant measure from theorem  [ theo : main][theo : main - b ] is indeed unique within the class @xmath49 .. in @xcite it is required that @xmath56 is `` sufficiently small '' . what is needed for",
    "is a suitable lasota - yorke inequality , and that this holds for @xmath57 follows just like our lemma  [ lem : lasota - yorke ] . ] whether this is true more generally sems to be an open question .",
    "our goal is to construct a coupled map lattice with a phase transition and not merely with a bifurcation at some critical parameter . as a criterion for a true phase transition in this sense mackay @xcite suggests that the dynamical system @xmath33 should satisfy a kind of space - time specification property called _ indecomposability _ - also after the phase transition has occured .",
    "but since in our case the dynamics do not even have a tractable symbolic representation , this property seems inappropriate here .",
    "instead we prove that each finite lattice version of the system @xmath58 has a unique absolutely continuous invariant measure which is mixing and equivalent to the finite - dimensional lebesgue measure on @xmath59 .",
    "more precisely :    [ theo : finite - dim ] let @xmath60 for some @xmath61 and define @xmath62 as in with periodic boundary conditions . for the map @xmath1 from theorem  [ theo : main ] and @xmath34 $ ] ,",
    "the system @xmath63 has a unique absolutely continuous invariant probability measure @xmath64 with the following properties :    a.   @xmath65 is mixing .",
    "indeed , it has exponentially decreasing correlations in time for smooth observables ( with a speed of decay that depends heavily on the system size @xmath66 , though ) .",
    "b.   the density @xmath67 is of bounded variation , so in particular @xmath68 , and @xmath69 lebesgue - almost everywhere .",
    "the same results remain true if instead of periodic boundary conditions one prescribes fixed or free boundary conditions .",
    "we give the proof of this theorem in section  [ sec : phasetr - bif ] .",
    "it is a simple variant of the folklore type argument from @xcite .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : smooth ] , we discuss how the same results as above can be produced for an analytic expanding circle map @xmath1 .",
    "we are not able , however , to replace also the diffusive nearest neighbour coupling by a coupling that can be described by a diffeomorphism of the state space @xmath19 , which on the one hand is close enough to the identity for the existence part of theorem  [ theo : main ] but on the other hand is sufficiently far away from the identity to admit a phase transition .",
    "so we are not able to construct examples of phase transitions in a class of systems as studied _",
    "e.g._in @xcite .",
    "the basic ingredient of the construction is a continuous piecewise linear markov map @xmath70\\to[-v , v]$ ] where @xmath71 and ( for later use ) @xmath72 are suitable numbers .",
    "the map @xmath73 is symmetric in the sense that @xmath74 , it leaves the two intervals @xmath75 $ ] and @xmath76 $ ] invariant , and its restrictions to each of these intervals are mixing with a strictly positive invariant density .",
    "however , the invariant density on @xmath76 $ ] , call it @xmath77 , is highly concentrated on the subinterval @xmath78\\subset[c , v]$ ] .",
    "the map @xmath1 on @xmath0 $ ] is then defined as @xmath79 with a suitable ( rather large ) @xmath80 .",
    "in particular , @xmath81 will be chosen such that @xmath82 .",

    "<S> we construct a mixing continuous piecewise linear map on @xmath0 $ ] with the property that a two - dimensional lattice made of these maps with a linear north and east nearest neighbour coupling admits a phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide a modification of this construction where the local map is an expanding analytic circle map . </S>",
    "<S> the basic strategy is borroughed from @xcite , namely we compare the dynamics of the cml to those of a probabilistic cellular automaton of toom s type , see @xcite for a detailed discussion . </S>"
