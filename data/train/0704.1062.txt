    "one of the most important quantities in investigating properties of the medium produced in high energy collisions is the particle distribution for different species of final state particles .",
    "rhic experiments have found a lot of novel phenomena from the particle spectra , such as the unexpectedly large @xmath2 ratio at @xmath3 @xcite , the constituent quark number scaling of the elliptic flows @xcite , and strong nuclear suppression of the pion spectrum in central au+au collisions @xcite , etc . from the spectrum",
    "one can learn a lot on the dynamics for particle production .",
    "in many studies , searching for a scaling behavior of some quantities vs suitable variables is useful for unveiling potential universal dynamics .",
    "a typical example is the proposal of the parton model from the @xmath4-scaling of the structure functions in deep - inelastic scatterings @xcite .",
    "quite recently , a scaling behavior @xcite of the pion spectrum at mid - rapidity in au+au collisions at rhic was found , which related spectra with different collision centralities . in @xcite",
    "the scaling behavior was extended to non - central region , up to @xmath5 for both au+au and d+au collisions .",
    "the same scaling function can be used to describe pion spectra for @xmath0 up to a few gev@xmath6 from different colliding systems at different rapidities and centralities .",
    "the shape of pion spectrum in those collisions is determined by only one parameter @xmath7 , the mean transverse momentum of the particle .",
    "it is very interesting to ask whether similar scaling behaviors can be found for spectra of other particles produced in au+au collisions at rhic . in this paper , the scaling property of the spectra for protons and anti - protons",
    "is investigated and compared with that for pions .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we will address the procedures for searching the scaling behaviors .",
    "then in sec .",
    "iii the scaling properties of the spectra for protons and anti - protons produced in au+au collisions at rhic at @xmath8 will be studied .",
    "we discuss mainly the centrality scaling of the spectra at mid - rapidity and extend the discussion to very forward region with rapidity @xmath1 and 3.2 briefly .",
    "iv is for discussions on the relation between the scaling behaviors and the string fragmentation scenario .",
    "as done in @xcite , the scaling behavior of a set of spectra at different centralities can be searched in a few steps .",
    "first , we define a scaled variable @xmath9 and the scaled spectrum @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 free parameters . as a convention",
    ", we choose @xmath13 for the most central collisions . with this choice",
    "@xmath14 is nothing but the @xmath0 distribution for the most central collisions . for the spectra with other centralities",
    ", we try to coalesce all data points to one curve by choosing proper parameters @xmath12 and @xmath11 .",
    "if this can be achieved , a scaling behavior is found .",
    "the detailed expression of the scaling function depends , of course , on the choice of @xmath12 and @xmath11 for the most central collisions .",
    "this arbitrary can be overcome by introducing another scaling variable @xmath15 and the normalized scaling function @xmath16 here @xmath17 is defined as @xmath18 by definition , @xmath19 .",
    "this scaled transverse momentum distribution is in essence similar to the kno - scaling @xcite on multiplicity distribution .",
    "now we focus on the spectra of protons and anti - protons produced at mid - rapidity in au+au collisions at @xmath8 . star and phenix collaborations at rhic published spectra for protons and anti - protons at mid - rapidity for a set of colliding centralities @xcite .",
    "star data have a @xmath0 coverage larger than phenix ones . as shown in fig . [ fig1 ]",
    ", all data points for proton spectra at different centralities can be put to the same curve with suitably chosen @xmath12 and @xmath11 , by the procedure explained in last section .",
    "the parameters are shown in table i. except a few points for very peripheral collisions ( centralities 60 - 92% for phenix data and",
    "60 - 80% for star data ) , all points agree well with the curve in about six orders of magnitude .",
    "the larger deviation of data at centralities 60 - 92% for phenix and 60 - 80% for star from the scaling curve may be due to the larger centrality coverage , because the size of colliding system changes dramatically in those centrality bins . for simplicity we define @xmath20 , and the curve can be parameterized as @xmath21        similarly , one can put all data points for anti - proton spectra at different centralities to a curve with other sets of parameters @xmath12 and @xmath11 which are given also in table i. the agreement is good , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , with only a few points in small @xmath0 region for peripheral collisions departing a little from the curve . for anti",
    "- proton the scaling function is @xmath22 with @xmath23 defined above .    .",
    "the solid curve is from eq .",
    "( 7).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    .parameters for coalescing all data points to the same curves in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     another important question is about the difference between the scaling functions for protons in this paper and for pions in @xcite .",
    "experiments at rhic have shown that the ratio of proton yield over that of pion increases with @xmath0 up to 1 in the region @xmath24 gev@xmath6 and saturates in large @xmath0 region .",
    "this behavior should be seen from the scaling functions for these two species of particles . for the purpose of comparing the scaling distributions",
    "we define a ratio @xmath25 and plot the ratio @xmath26 as a function of @xmath27 in fig .",
    ". the ratio increases with @xmath27 , when @xmath27 is small , reaches a maximum at @xmath27 about 1 and then decreases .",
    "finally it decreases slowly to about 0.1 for very large @xmath27 .",
    "the highest value of @xmath26 is about 1.6 , while the experimentally observed @xmath28 over @xmath29 ratio is about 1 at @xmath3 .",
    "the reason for this difference is two - fold .",
    "one is the normalization difference in defining @xmath26 and the experimental ratio .",
    "another lies in the different mean transverse momenta @xmath7 s for pions and protons with which the scaling variable @xmath27 is defined and used in getting the ratio @xmath26 .",
    "the existence of difference in the scaling distributions for different species of particles produced in high energy collisions is not surprising , because the distributions reflect the particle production dynamics which may be different for different particles . in the quark recombination models @xcite pions",
    "are formed by combining a quark and an anti - quark while protons by three quarks . because different numbers of ( anti)quarks participate in forming the particles",
    ", their scaling distributions must be different . in this sense ,",
    "our investigation results urge more studies on particle production mechanisms .     between the scaling functions for protons and pions produced in au+au collisions at rhic as a function of the scaling variable @xmath27 .",
    "the pion scaling distribution is from @xcite.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "from above investigation we have found scaling distributions for protons and anti - protons produced in au+au collisions at rhic in both mid - rapidity and forward region .",
    "the difference between those two scaling distributions is quite small , but they differ a lot from that for pions and the ratio @xmath30 exhibits a nontrivial behavior .",
    "investigations in @xcite and in this paper have shown that particle distributions can be put to the same curve by linear transformation on @xmath0 . though we have not yet a uniform picture for the particle productions in high energy nuclear collisions , the scaling behaviors can , in some sense , be compared to that from the string fragmentation picture @xcite . in that picture",
    "if there are @xmath31 strings , they may overlap in an area of @xmath32 and the average area for a string is then @xmath33 .",
    "it is shown that the momentum distributions can be related to the case in @xmath34 collisions also by a linear variable change @xmath35 .",
    "viewed from that picture , our fitted @xmath11 gives the degree of string overlap .",
    "the average area for a string in most central au+au collisions is about 70 percent of that in peripheral ones from the values of @xmath11 obtained from fitting the spectra of proton .",
    "if string fragmentation is really the production mechanism for all species of particles in the collisions , one can expect that the overlap degree obtained is the same from the changes of spectrum of any particle . in the language in this work , values of @xmath11",
    "are expected the same for pions , protons and other particles in the string fragmentation picture for particle production .",
    "our results show the opposite . comparing the values of @xmath11 from @xcite and this work",
    ", one can see that for pion spectrum @xmath11 is larger for more peripheral collisions but smaller for proton and anti - proton spectra .",
    "our results indicate that other particle production mechanisms may also provide ways to the scaling distributions .",
    "obviously more detailed studies , both theoretically and experimentally , are needed .",
