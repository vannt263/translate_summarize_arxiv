    "the first direct observable of importance is obviously the search for the charged higgs with the current experimental limit coming from the process @xmath16 .",
    "the best searches so far only place a lower limit on @xmath17 of @xmath18 , which is far below indirect searches in 2hdms .",
    "however , the parameters in the higgs sector of susy are all strongly connected . at tree level",
    ", the charged higgs mass depends on the cp - odd higgs , @xmath19 , through the relationship : m_h^^2=m_a^2+m_w^2 .",
    "many other relationships like this exist amongst the higgs parameters and at tree level the higgs spectrum in susy is usually determined by two parameters , commonly taken to be the mass of the cp - odd higgs boson , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . through these relationships direct limits on other higgs particles impact the mass range available to the charged higgs .",
    "two direct limits of interest are those on @xmath20 and the lightest cp - even higgs mass , @xmath22 .",
    "the lightest cp - even higgs , @xmath9 , in particular has been strongly sought after and in susy is quite light , lighter than @xmath23 at tree level .",
    "however , quantum corrections play a large role , and can raise @xmath22 above the lep bound of @xmath24 .",
    "the primary quantum corrections of interest are those generated by stop loops and yielding a light higgs mass  @xcite : m_h^2 & = & m_z^2 ^ 22(1- ) + & & + .",
    "[ higgscorrectioneq ] in the above @xmath25 and @xmath26 is understood to be the average mass of the top squarks .",
    "the size of these corrections can vary greatly , and in many phenomenological studies , the choice is reduced to two extremes , these being the  max - mixing \" and  no - mixing \" scenarios .",
    "the max - mixing scenario occurs when @xmath22 is maximized by setting @xmath27 , whereas the no - mixing scenario sets @xmath28 .",
    "the former case generally implies large @xmath19-terms while the latter typically requires a heavier @xmath26 in order to pass the lep bound .",
    "the lower limit on the higgs mass of @xmath24 was obtained through a search for the sm higgstrahlung process ( @xmath29 ) at lep .",
    "susy effects can alter the bound significantly because of a suppression in the coupling between the z boson and the light higgs ( @xmath30 ) which leads to a suppression of the cross section of the form : ^hz _ & = & ^2(-)^hz_. in the above , @xmath31 is the standard model cross section given by : ^hz _ & = & c_ew ^1/2(+12sm_z^2 ) , + & = & ( s - m_h^2 - m_z^2)^2 - 4m_h^2m_z^2 , where , we condense the pieces of the calculation not dependent on @xmath22 into a constant @xmath32 .",
    "this constant depends on the center of mass energy , @xmath33 , and other electroweak parameters such as @xmath23 , @xmath34 and the weak angle , @xmath35 .",
    "lep also considered the production of the cp - odd higgs boson , @xmath19 .",
    "the cross section for @xmath36 is suppressed by @xmath37 which goes as : ^2(- ) = in the higgs decoupling limit , where @xmath20 is large , @xmath38 which leaves the higgstrahlung process above sm - like .",
    "these two experiments are complementary and combine for a robust constraint on the light cp - even higgs .",
    "we implemented the constraint from the sm higgs search by requiring the the higgstrahlung cross section for the susy higgs , @xmath9 , satisfies the following bound : ^hz_(m_h;=209 ) ^hz_(m_h = 114 , = 209 ) .",
    "for the complementary process , @xmath39 , the decay of the @xmath19 boson is unfortunately very model dependent",
    ". therefore we will enforce the lep constraint on @xmath20 of @xmath40 though it is possible that a lighter @xmath19 could be possible .",
    "finally , lep has also placed limits on other susy particles .",
    "for instance , the lightest stop , @xmath41 , is required to be heavier than @xmath42 and the lightest chargino , @xmath43 , must be heavier than @xmath44 .",
    "this last limit constrains the @xmath45 parameter through the chargino mass matrix .",
    "while other susy particles have direct limits imposed by lep , such as the lightest sbottom , @xmath46 and lightest neutralino , @xmath47 , they do not have a sizeable effect for the parameter space we examine in this analysis more details about these constraints is given in section 4 .",
    "over the last decade , the number of measured observables and their precision has increased dramatically .",
    "these measurements have in turn provided new , powerful constraints on beyond the sm physics and susy in particular . in this analysis",
    "many different flavor - violating processes are considered which are enhanced by the presence of a light charged higgs .",
    "these include processes such as @xmath48 , which currently places a very strong limit on @xmath17 in 2hdms .",
    "there is also @xmath1 , which receives corrections from susy which are an order of magnitude greater than the sm contributions .",
    "we study these processes and other flavor observables , such as the decays @xmath2 and @xmath3 which are tree - level processes mediated by a charged higgs .",
    "the calculation of @xmath0 is generally broken into two parts by way of the operator product expansion .",
    "the short range physics , which includes all the contributions from susy , is contained in the calculation of the wilson coefficients,@xmath49 .",
    "the calculation of these coefficients is well documented in the literature .",
    "@xcite the @xmath50 and @xmath51 contributions , which are shown in fig.[bsgdiags]a)-b ) , are as follows : _ w & = & _ 1 ( ) , + c_h^ & = & ( _ 1()+ _ 2 ( ) ) , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are kinematic loop functions given in  @xcite .",
    "these two contributions are the only ones found in 2hdms and they always constructively interfere .",
    "this allows the current measurements on @xmath0 to place strict limits on the charged higgs mass in such models , with current bounds requiring the charged higgs in 2hdms to be heavier than @xmath54 .    within susy ,",
    "the charged higgs and sm contributions also interfere constructively , but now there are the chargino contributions , shown in fig .",
    "[ bsgdiags]c ) , which depend on several different particles masses and the chargino and stop mixing angles ; these in turn bring in a dependence on soft susy parameters such as @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the chargino contributions usually interfere destructively with the sm , which weakens the limit on @xmath17 coming from @xmath0 .",
    "to determine the effect of this short range physics , the entire calculation , including the long range qcd effects , must be considered . converting the wilson coefficients into a rate for @xmath57 has been well studied  @xcite .",
    "we use the nll calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , which easily and analytically incorporates new physics from the wilson coefficients .",
    "the largest source of error in this calculation comes from the charm mass in the ratio @xmath58 and we use this large uncertainty to tune the nll calculation so that it reproduces the nnlo theoretical value for the sm calculation of @xmath57 of @xmath59 when the new physics is turned off .",
    "this theoretical value is lower than the current experimental value which is given by the heavy flavor averaging group  @xcite to be : ( bx_s)_exp&= & ( 3.550.24^+0.09_-0.100.03)10 ^ -4 .",
    "this allows some room for new physics , and leads to the following @xmath60 confidence interval which we enforce on our analysis : 3.0310 ^ -4 < & ( bx_s)_e_>1.6 & < 4.0610 ^ -4 .",
    "another probe of susy , which is particularly powerful at large @xmath5 , is the decay @xmath1 .",
    "this process is mediated by higgs penguin diagrams which create an effective coupling between @xmath61 and the down type quarks : @xmath62 .",
    "this effective coupling picks up contributions from two sources in susy , a gluino loop which is flavor preserving and a chargino loop which is flavor violating as shown in fig .",
    "[ higgspenguins ] .",
    "the size of this effective coupling is given by  @xcite : ( _ u)^ji & = & y_d_j(_0^ij+_yy_t^2v^3j*v^3i ) , where @xmath63 designate the quark generation , and _ 0 & = & -h_2(x^q/,x^d/ ) , + _ y & = & h_2(x^q/,x^u/ ) .",
    "here @xmath64 and the other @xmath65 s are similarly defined and @xmath66 is a kinematic function defined to be : h_2(x , y)&=&+ .",
    "two of the prominent features of this decay are its strong dependence on @xmath5 and @xmath20 , which enter the branching ratio with six and four powers respectively . in the large @xmath5 limit , where the susy contribution is clearly important",
    ", the branching ratio can be formulated as  @xcite : ( b_s ) & = & 3.510 ^ -5 ^ 6 ^2 ^2 + & & . in the above ,",
    "_ 3 & = & _ 0+_yy_t^2 .",
    "this large @xmath5 enhancement allows the susy contribution to this decay to dominate over the sm prediction , which is highly suppressed : @xmath67 . such a large possible contribution from new physics",
    "has driven the search for this decay .",
    "currently , the strongest experimental limit comes from cdf  @xcite : ( b_s ) _ & < & 5.810 ^ -8 .",
    "the process @xmath0 , though it is well - studied and provides a strong constraint , only depends on the charged higgs through loops .",
    "this allows other susy particles to interfere with the effect of the charged higgs contribution as described above",
    ". however , susy models with a charged higgs also generate tree - level flavor violation and without the loop factors , @xmath68 corrections to several processes can be produced .",
    "one process of interest is @xmath2 which is generated by a simple tree - level exchange of a @xmath51 .",
    "the contribution of the charged higgs to @xmath2 has been studied in many sources  @xcite and the decay rate is given by : ( b^+)&=&|v_ub|^2 ( 1-)^2r_h , where @xmath69 contains the @xmath17 dependence : r_h = ( 1-)^2 . in the equation above , the @xmath70 is the same higgs penguin corrections discussed in the @xmath1 section .    the current experimental limits for @xmath2 is often expressed as a limit on the ratio of the experimental value and the sm theoretical calculation  @xcite : r_b= & = & 1.280.38 .",
    "we turn this into a @xmath60 confidence interval on @xmath71 : 0.52<&r_b<2.04    however , while @xmath2 can provide a strong experimental constraint , as found in  @xcite , its calculation is plagued by large theoretical uncertainties ; neither the decay constant , @xmath72 , nor the ckm element @xmath73 are well measured .",
    "@xmath73 in particular is poorly understood with a large range of experimental measurements which depend on whether the measurement is from the inclusive or exclusive decays .",
    "in fact , several of the most precise measurements of @xmath73 obtain very different results  @xcite .",
    "this presents a problem when trying to interpret the effect of this constraint on our models and we will discuss it further in section @xmath74 .      while @xmath2 has a large theoretical uncertainty due to the error in @xmath73 , @xmath3 depends on the more accurately measured @xmath75 .",
    "unfortunately , the presence of multiple neutrinos in the final state makes the detection of @xmath3 more of an experimental challenge .",
    "but , with growing certainty in the measurement , it can possibly provide comparable power to constrain new physics models .    in order to limit the dependence on hadronic parameters , it is more useful to calculate a ratio of @xmath76 decays .",
    "we follow the results of refs .",
    "@xcite to obtain the ratio : & = & ( 0.280.02)(1 + 1.38re(c_np ) + 0.88|c_np|^2 ) . in the above , @xmath77 contains all the contributions that come from new physics . neglecting all but the tree - level charged higgs contributions ,",
    "one finds : c_np & = & - .",
    "we compare our calculation to the measurement by babar  @xcite : & = & 0.4160.1170.052 . which leads to a @xmath60 confidence interval of : 0.151<<0.681 .",
    "the observables listed in the previous sections are the dominant constraints on the charged higgs mass , and they are also the most model independent .",
    "there are however a number of other constraints which are traditionally applied to the parameter space of the mssm , some of which we use and others we choose to ignore , for reasons we outline now .",
    "so far , we have applied nothing in the way of constraints on the slepton sector . though this sector has a rather rich phenomenology ,",
    "constraints arising here generally depend on slepton masses and mixings , and on complicated , highly model - dependent decay rates among the neutralinos and sleptons .",
    "such observables however , exhibit very weak , or no , direct dependence on the charged higgs mass .",
    "if we were to implement some unification constraints on our models , such as is often done in the literature ( , a unified scalar mass , @xmath78 ) , the sleptons become linked to the squark sector and therefore in turn to the higgs sector . enforcing such a constraint on the mass spectrum will of necessity result in tighter limits on @xmath79 which are higher than in more general models . since",
    "our goal is to find something close to an absolute lower bound on @xmath79 , we will not take this approach .",
    "however there are still a few , generally useful constraints that we can learn from physics in the ( s)leptonic sector .",
    "the main such constraint arises from the measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment , denoted @xmath80 .",
    "both the theoretical and experimental values of @xmath80 have been extracted to extraordinarily high precision , with a small ( roughly @xmath81 ) discrepancy found between experiment and the sm .",
    "the current difference between experiment and the sm calculation is  @xcite : @xmath82 if the spectrum of susy is at all light , then it will contribute to this anomaly , but with a sign that depends almost solely on the sign of the @xmath55-parameter  @xcite .",
    "given the sign of the discrepancy , a positive sign for @xmath55 is favored ( using here the les houches conventions  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we will present our results under the assumption of @xmath83 , leaving the case for @xmath84 for our comments at the end of the next section .",
    "but since the sleptons play little other direct role in constraining @xmath79 , we will push all slepton masses to @xmath85 so that they do nt inadvertently create correlations which are not generic to the mssm .",
    "another possible constraint comes from astrophysics .",
    "observations  @xcite have shown that there is an abundance of dark matter in the universe which can not be explained within the sm .",
    "low energy susy models generally introduce a new symmetry , called @xmath86-parity , in order to avoid fast proton decay . in the process , @xmath86-parity forces the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) to be stable , making it a candidate for the universe s dark matter .",
    "ideally there are two sets of constraints on the lsp .",
    "first , it must be electrically neutral so that the matter is truly  dark \" , and second it must produce the correct density of dark matter as observed by astronomers .",
    "we will use the first constraint ( though , as we will see , it does very little for us ) , but ignore the second constraint , since constraints on the calculated relic abundance once again produce a great deal of model dependence in our results .",
    "the goal of this analysis is to find a lower bound on the charged higgs mass within the mssm , but without enforcing  unnatural \" constraints on the model , such as unification of all scalar masses . as we will see shortly , the analysis here is not entirely general , but captures most of the physics that a truly general analysis would uncover .",
    "one way in which we avoid being completely general is in our treatment of the radiative corrections to the lightest neutral higgs boson .",
    "studies of the higgs sector phenomenology usually consider two particular limits for the lightest higgs mass , called the  maximal mixing \" and  no mixing \" scenarios .",
    "the names refer to the size of the top squark mixing corrections that are calculated at the susy decoupling scale , as discussed earlier .",
    "all of our calculations are done within one or the other of these scenarios .",
    "our basic procedure is to perform a random scan over the low - energy parameters of the mssm , enforcing all constraints and then finding the lower bound on @xmath79 consistent with those constraints . for the plots that follow ,",
    "we have shown only 10,000 points , though we have studied the parameter space with many more , particularly near the boundaries where a transition between constraints arises .",
    "the parameters in the scan are entirely weak - scale parameters ; no unification or running is done in the analysis .",
    "but these parameters are generally not equal to physical masses , and we include f- and d - term contributions , left - right mixing , and leading one - loop corrections in calculating physical mass eigenvalues . in the next few paragraphs we summarize the constraints that we place on the input parameters in order to define our model space .",
    "we begin by setting the slepton masses to be very heavy  @xmath85  and @xmath55 positive . as we mentioned in the previous section , the observables which depend crucially on slepton masses , such as the dark matter relic density or @xmath80 , have very little correlation with the charged higgs mass . by setting the slepton masses high , and by choosing that our models have a positive sign for @xmath55",
    ", we include the indications given by these constraints without ruling out otherwise  good \" models unnecessarily .",
    "another way to say this is as follows : if a model point is acceptable in every way except that it generates too much / too little dark matter , or falls outside the experimentally allowed range for @xmath80 , we can probably fix that problem by shifting the slepton masses , without affecting the charged higgs mass in any way .",
    "thus we choose to essentially decouple the sleptons from the start .    in the squark sector",
    "we set the masses of the first two generations to @xmath87 , for reasons that echo those for the sleptons .",
    "however the third generation plays a key role in the charged higgs bound , coming into both the radiative corrections to the higgs masses themselves , and the chargino - stop diagrams that contribute to @xmath0 .",
    "thus we allow the the third generation soft squark mass parameters to run within the range of @xmath88 to @xmath87 . to make the analysis simpler ,",
    "we assume that the soft mass parameters for each of the third generation squark states ( the left - handed stop - sbottom doublet , and the right - handed stop and sbottom singlets ) all share a common soft mass , @xmath89 . from the soft masses ,",
    "the physical masses are calculated by adding the  threshold corrections \" : f- and d - term pieces , as well as left - right mixing .",
    "for the left - right mixing , we will need to choose values for the @xmath19 and @xmath55-terms , which we will discuss shortly .",
    "some loss of generality is unavoidable by our choice of a universal third generation squark mass .",
    "even so , after including threshold corrections to the squark masses , the squarks can become as light as @xmath8 , where they would start to run into tevatron constraints .    as for the left - right mixing",
    ", we set all @xmath19-terms , except @xmath56 , to be zero .",
    "( we assume that trilinear soft breaking terms are proportional to their corresponding yukawa matrices , which justifies this simplification . ) instead of varying @xmath56 as another free parameter , it instead takes on two extreme values that have been used in many phenomenological studies of susy .",
    "the first is the max - mixing scenario in which @xmath90 is given a value such that the correction to the light higgs mass in eq .",
    "( [ higgscorrectioneq ] ) is maximized .",
    "once @xmath55 and @xmath5 are chosen in a model , @xmath56 is chosen such that @xmath91 .",
    "the second scenario is the no - mixing scenario in which @xmath92 and @xmath93 is identically zero .    in the gaugino sector",
    ", we set the bino mass , @xmath94 , and the gluino mass , @xmath95 , to fixed values , while allowing the wino mass , @xmath96 , to vary between 100 and @xmath88 .",
    "varying @xmath96 is important because , along with the @xmath55 parameter it directly enters the diagrams for @xmath0 through the chargino masses .",
    "@xmath94 , however , does not need to vary , as the only constraint that depends heavily on its value is the lsp dark matter constraint . with the sneutrino masses raised to @xmath97 tev ,",
    "the only remaining candidate for dark matter is the lightest neutralino , whose mass is tied strongly to @xmath94 . for this analysis , @xmath98 , a value which both satisfies the lep bound on @xmath47 , and provides for @xmath47 to be the lsp .",
    "( there is a small dependence in @xmath0 on @xmath94 through the neutralino diagrams , but this effect is far too small to affect our results . )    the gluino mass , @xmath95 , has no leading contributions to any of the observables we are considering , but it does have one sub - leading effect . because the non - holomorphic corrections to the down - quark masses depend on @xmath95 ( through the parameter @xmath70 ) , there is a second order dependence in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "even @xmath1 , which depends heavily on the non - holomorphic terms , is primarily dependent only on @xmath99 ( which has no @xmath95 dependence ) , and only receives a small correction via the @xmath95-dependent @xmath70 term .",
    "for these reasons , @xmath95 in this study is set to a fixed value of @xmath87 , at which most of its effects decouple .   or @xmath70",

    "the lower bound of @xmath101 is set by the lep limit on chargino masses .",
    "we treat the higgs sector much like the others  we vary over a set of input parameters and check to see if the resulting set of inputs is consistent with all of our constraints . normally one parametrizes the higgs sector with two parameters , @xmath5 and @xmath20 . but for the purposes of this paper , it is more convenient to replace @xmath20 with @xmath79 which is allowed to vary between 100 and @xmath8 . the upper bound is set because above @xmath8 it is rather trivial to find models consistent with the @xmath0 constraint , and so we have no interest there .",

    "but in the no - mixing scenario , @xmath56 is set to be equal to @xmath122 , which is very small at large @xmath5 .",
    "thus it is possible that the no - mixing scenario , lacking a strong @xmath1 constraint , might allow for light @xmath112 over a wider range of parameters .",
    "in fact , the no - mixing scenario changes the picture dramatically , but not as one might expect from the arguments in the previous paragraph .",
    "our result is shown in fig .",
    "[ nomixhvstanb ] . as expected , the @xmath1 constraint is now entirely absent . in its place",
    "is an even stronger @xmath0 constraint , and at @xmath123 , the @xmath2 constraint .",
    "the origin of the strengthened @xmath0 appears to be as follows : the no - mixing scenario gets its name from the absence of left - right mixing among the top squarks .",
    "but left - right stop mixing plays a key role in several of the diagrams that help to cancel the @xmath112 contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "( recall that @xmath0 has the form of a magnetic moment operator and is thus chirality changing . for many parts of the calculation ,",
    "the @xmath19-terms provide the chirality flip . )",
    "this @xmath0 constraint prohibits any light charged higgs masses from appearing at low @xmath5 .",
    "recall that in the max - mixing scenario , the constraint from @xmath2 was almost unnecessary as the @xmath1 constraint seemed to rule out almost all models which would violate experimental bounds on @xmath2 .",
    "for the no - mixing scenario , the @xmath1 constraint is irrelevant , and the @xmath2 constraint plays a more interesting role . because the @xmath50 and @xmath51 contributions to @xmath2 interfere , the high @xmath5 , low @xmath17 region is not completely ruled out by @xmath2 . at very high @xmath5 , the charged higgs contribution can be twice as large , and with opposite sign , as the sm piece .",
    "in this region , the @xmath2 constraint breaks down and a low charged higgs mass is not ruled out . in our analysis",
    ", this occurs at @xmath124 , where a charged higgs mass of about @xmath125 is allowed . of course , at even larger @xmath5 , the charged higgs contribution becomes altogether too large , ruling out all the available low @xmath17 parameter space .",
    "but there is one caveat : recall from our discussion in @xmath108 that the @xmath2 calculation is plagued by uncertainties , the largest coming from the poorly measured value of @xmath73 and , to a slightly lesser degree , @xmath72 .",
    "the uncertainty in these inputs translates into an uncertainty in the boundary of the region ruled out by @xmath2 .",
    "depending on the precise values used , the region at @xmath126 where we find light charged higgs masses may grow ( , a light charged higgs could be consistent even for slightly lower @xmath5 ) or it could vanish completely ( due to the competing constraint from @xmath3 ) .",
    "one of us is examining this issue further  @xcite .    while the two main scenarios detailed above cover a important , and often studied , portions of the low - energy mssm parameter space , there are still large portions of the mssm not fully examined .",
    "we have also examined some other special regions of the parameter space , but found no results inconsistent with those shown above . in particular , we have dropped the constraint on the sign of @xmath55 coming from @xmath80 ; we find that cancellations in @xmath0 are even more difficult to arrange , and so a light @xmath112 is even more unlikely .",
    "a discovery of the charged higgs , predicted in both trivial ( 2hdsm ) and non - trivial ( mssm ) extensions to the standard model , would be an unambiguous sign of new physics .",
    "such a particle could be discovered directly at the lhc or through its indirect effects on rare flavor - changing processes . in 2hdsms in particular",
    ", the measurement of @xmath0 puts a severe constraint on the mass of a charged higgs .",
    "however , in the mssm , new contributions from other susy particles may partially cancel the charged higgs contribution , which allows for a considerable reduction in this bound .",
    "precise knowledge of how light the charged higgs is allowed to be in the mssm is an important question for experimental searches , both direct and indirect .",
    "several analyses have appeared over the last year examining exactly this question  @xcite .",
    "but because the parameter space of the mssm is so vast , each has make a different set of assumptions about the sparticle mass spectrum , mostly from a top - down approach .    in this paper",
    "we re - examined this issue in an entirely bottom - up way .",
    "the points in parameter space which we have studied were chosen based on low - energy criteria alone , and not on their ability to unify at some ultraviolet scale .",
    "while one criticism of this paper would be our lack of unification , we feel that this is offset by our ability to find higgs bounds which are fairly model independent .",
    "likewise we have chosen to ignore questions of dark matter relic densities because the calculation of said densities would require knowing details of the spectrum ( such as the slepton masses ) which have no immediate effect on the charged higgs mass , and which we therefore consider to be tunable .",
    "we suffice to demand that the lsp be a neutralino , which will at least afford the model a potentially viable dark matter candidate .    in order to make a bottom - up analysis simple yet useful",
    ", we made one further simplification : we examined the mssm in the two extremes of no - mixing and maximal - mixing , where each is defined by the effect of stop mixing corrections on the light scalar higgs mass .",
    "these scenarios are frequently examined in the phenomenological susy literature and so provide good starting points for any more complete discussion .",
    "the main results of this paper , in each of these two limits , can be found in fig .",
    "[ maxmixhvstanb ] ( max - mixing ) and fig .",
    "[ nomixhvstanb ] ( no - mixing ) . for the max - mixing case",
    ", the charged higgs can be found to be as light as @xmath4 , with a hard lower limit coming from the lep searches for the light higgs .",
    "this agrees well with the cmssm analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , and is fairly similar to the large , positive @xmath56 case in ref .  @xcite .",
    "because the max - mixing scenario requires relatively large @xmath56 , the process @xmath1 rules out most of the available parameter space at high @xmath5 . at low to moderate @xmath5 , it is possible to find a charged higgs as light as @xmath4 , but we are required to have a light set of squarks to cancel out the charged higgs contributions to @xmath0 .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ maxmixmsqvsmhpm ] , where a charged higgs mass below @xmath125 must be offset by squark(s ) with mass below @xmath115 .    for the no - mixing scenario ,",
    "the story is quite different .",
    "first , the constraint from @xmath0 becomes even more powerful .",
    "this appears to be because , with small @xmath56 , many of the chargino - stop diagrams become significantly weaker , as they require left - right stop mixing .",
    "second , the @xmath1 constraints disappear entirely , as the branching ratio is proportional to @xmath127 . but the @xmath1 constraint is mostly replaced by the @xmath2 constraint , which now plays a large and more complicated role , since the @xmath7 and @xmath112 contributions can cancel under some conditions .",
    "thus in the no - mixing scenario at low to moderate @xmath5 , the strengthened @xmath0 constraint pushed the lightest charged higgs mass up to roughly @xmath128 . for @xmath121 , we found that a charged higgs mass as low as @xmath125 is possible , which loosely agrees with the  nuhm \" case found in ref .",
    "@xcite , though our choice of theoretical and experimental inputs differs from theirs in detail .    either way , we have shown that in the oft - studied  max - mixing \" and  no - mixing \" susy higgs scenarios , it is possible for a charged higgs mass as light as 140 to @xmath125 to be observed .",
    "however such an observation requires cancellations in @xmath0 ( and perhaps other processes ) that can only occur if one or both of the top squarks are lighter than 400 to @xmath88 .",
    "thus , within the context of the mssm , observation of such a light charged higgs would appear to guarantee a host of other sparticle discoveries , making for a very exciting period at the lhc .",
    "this work was partially supported by the national science foundation under grant phy-0355066 and by the notre dame center for applied mathematics .",

    "<S> one that stands out ( among several ) would be the discovery of a charged higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> while physicists have become comfortable thinking of the sm as a theory with a single higgs su(2 ) doublet , there are simple extensions , trivially consistent with all available data , in which additional su(2 ) singlets and/or doublets are added to the spectrum of the higgs sector . </S>",

    "<S> . however , we will try to maintain , in so far as possible , a completely  bottom - up \" analysis ; that is , we make no assumption about unification at some high scale , which means we avoid the hidden correlations that usually arise in that class of models . </S>",
