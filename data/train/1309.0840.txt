    "this work was continued by carmeli , heinosaari , schultz , and toigo @xcite , who slightly improved the number of observables that suffice in this setting in some cases .    at the time of this writing",
    "we were aware of prior results on the number of observables required for process tomography only under certain sparsity assumptions @xcite , but not under the promise that the unknown channel is unitary or has few kraus operators .",
    "additional prior work was subsequently brought to our attention after the journal version of this article was published .",
    "most notably , flammia , gross , liu , and eisert used compressed sensing techniques to show that a channel with @xmath3 kraus operators can be identified with @xmath18 observables , which is already optimal to within a logarithmic factor of @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "by contrast to this prior work , our primary goal is to minimize the number of observables required for tomography without regard to how those observables might be implemented .",
    "however , in section [ sec : future : experimental ] we observe that the six observables required for tomography of qubit unitary channels are in fact products of clifford operators .",
    "the primary results of section [ sec : intro : results ] rest upon several supplementary results on interactive observables , on the construction of subspaces of hermitian matrices with various conditions on rank , eigenvalues , and partial trace , and on the construction of totally nonsingular matrices with various useful properties .      before we can talk of the number of observables required for process tomography it is necessary to clarify the meaning of the word `` observable '' in this context . in section [ sec :",
    "observable ] we introduce the notion of an _ interactive observable _ for channels , a special case of which is an ordinary observable for states .",

    "such an extraction is possible if and only if @xmath21 lies in the unit ball of the _ dual of the strategy @xmath171-norm _ presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thus , as with no - signaling channels in section [ sec : future : ns ] , one can employ the reduction of section [ sec : reduction ] and search for large discriminating subspaces of @xmath336 where @xmath337    in short : the task of formalizing the notion of an @xmath171-round interactive observable is not the bottleneck that thwarts attempts to bound the number of observables needed for strategy tomography .",
    "rather , the bottleneck lies in the same place as with no - signaling channels and other types of channel  in the ability ( or lack thereof ) to construct large subspaces of high - rank matrices that also satisfy a myriad of partial trace constraints .",
    "one of the drawbacks of our approach to process tomography is that the interactive observables obtained from theorem [ thm : unitary_uda_udp ] do not necessarily have a nice form ",
    "they might not be clifford operators , they could be non - local , and so on .",
    "hence , they might be difficult to implement in the laboratory .",
    "it would be interesting to consider the number of interactive observables required to reconstruct unitary channels under certain additional `` niceness '' restrictions such as these .    in order to illustrate the type of result that would be desirable we consider the @xmath338 case of theorem  [ thm : unitary_uda_udp].1 , which says that six interactive observables suffice to uniquely determine unitary qubit channels among unitary qubit channels .",
    "we now show that we can in fact find six interactive observables for this purpose that are both local and clifford .    to this",
    "end our goal is to find six linearly independent hermitian local clifford operators @xmath339 with two vanishing partial traces that are each orthogonal to the three operators   presented in the proof of proposition  [ thm : unitary ] .",
    "the following are six such operators : @xmath340 where @xmath341 are the pauli operators and @xmath342 are the clifford operators with standard basis representations @xmath343 this construction of @xmath344 is _ ad hoc _ , and it is not clear whether it can be generalized to the other cases of theorem  [ thm : unitary_uda_udp ] .    as described in section  [ sec : observable : decompose ] , each of these interactive observables specifies a measurement on a maximally entangled input state , which is not nice .",
    "it is not difficult to see that these interactive observables could be measured using only experimentally - friendly product state inputs .",
    "however , this product state implementation essentially consists of measuring all twelve degrees of freedom and then throwing away half of the resulting information in order to compile the results into the six observables required for tomography .",
