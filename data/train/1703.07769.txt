    "( [ eq : pearcey - caustic ] ) , we see that the peak height is proportional to the inverse of @xmath211 and to the amplitude function  @xmath212 , which should be evaluated at @xmath50 .",
    "however , we do not expect that the latter function will significantly contribute to a difference in peak height , considering its functional form for the dirac equation , see ref .",
    "@xcite . for the dirac equation ,",
    "the function @xmath158 essentially consists of two parts .",
    "the first part comes from the electron source and depends on the angle of incidence and the sublattice polarization .",
    "the second part is the transmission coefficient through the barrier , which is to be evaluated at @xmath213 . because of the symmetry of the system , @xmath214 for both valleys . in the dirac picture",
    ", this corresponds to normal incidence , i.e. the incidence angle @xmath215 , and hence all phase factors that depend on the angle equal unity .",
    "furthermore , at normal incidence we have klein tunneling , i.e. the transmission is unity regardless of the height of the potential .",
    "although trigonal warping certainly introduces corrections in the amplitude function , we do not expect that these will greatly influence either of the two factors at the cusp point .",
    "therefore , we believe that the amplitude function @xmath158 at the cusp point depends only weakly on both the potential @xmath42 and the valley index @xmath7 .",
    "we thus believe that the factor that has the largest influence on a possible difference in peak height between the two valleys is the coefficient @xmath211 , on which we therefore focus our attention .    as with the position of the maximum , one generally needs to resort to numerical methods to obtain the coefficient @xmath211 at @xmath50 .",

    "the absolute value of the second term is equal for both values of @xmath7 , implying that , for small values of @xmath132 and hence for low energies , the transmission peaks for both valleys will be equal in height when we consider @xmath205 .",
    "if we want to see whether this changes when we go to higher energies , we need to consider the second term in the expansion of @xmath166 .",
    "unfortunately , when we expand @xmath34 to second order in @xmath132 , the equation @xmath218 becomes third order in @xmath42 , which makes the expression for @xmath54 much more complicated .",
    "this also makes the second order expansion of @xmath166 in @xmath132 at @xmath54 very cumbersome .",
    "nonetheless , we can say something about it by taking another look at our previous equations .",
    "the key observation is that in all our equations @xmath132 appears together with @xmath7 in the combination @xmath37 .",
    "this holds for the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h - class - trigwarp - dimless ] ) and for the momenta  ( [ eq : px - el ] ) and  ( [ eq : px - h ] ) and therefore also for all derived quantities , such as @xmath34 and @xmath166 .",
    "this implies that we are actually dealing with an expansion in @xmath37 rather than in just @xmath132 , which means that the second term in the expansion is proportional to @xmath219 . since @xmath220",

    ", we conclude that intervalley scattering is present , but is not the dominant scattering process .",
    "the amount of intervalley scattering , measured as a fraction of the total transmission into the collector lead , is larger for lead modes with higher transversal momentum , most likely due to interaction with the drain leads at the edges .",
    "it ranges from approximately 1% for the lowest lead mode , which is almost completely transmitted into the collector lead , up to 60% for higher lead modes , which are largely transmitted into the drain leads and therefore have a much smaller effect on the outcome .",
    "we come back to the size of intervalley scattering and provide a more quantitative picture later on , when we discuss scattering as a function of potential strength .",

    "<S> we emphasize that our analysis of the disintegration of the ideal focus does not fundamentally depend on the fact that the fermi surface distortion is trigonal : any distortion that breaks the symmetry in @xmath27 will lead to the formation of cusp caustics . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our semiclassical analysis can easily be carried over to other dirac materials , such as topological insulators  @xcite . </S>",
