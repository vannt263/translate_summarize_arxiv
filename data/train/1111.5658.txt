    "in the study of bivariate polynomials orthogonal on the bi - circle progress has recently been made in understanding these polynomials in the case when the orthogonality measure is purely absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is of degree @xmath2 in @xmath3 and @xmath4 in @xmath5 and is stable i.e. is nonzero for @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the normalized lebesgue measure on the torus @xmath8 .",
    "such measures have come to be called bernstein - szeg measures and they played an important role in the extension of the fejr - riesz factorization lemma to two variables @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in particular in order to determine whether a positive trigonometric polynomial can be factored as a magnitude square of a stable polynomial an important role was played by a bivariate analog of the christoffel - darboux formula .",
    "the derivation of this formula was non trivial even if one begins with the stable polynomial @xmath9 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this formula was shown to be a special case of the formula derived by cole and wermer @xcite through operator theoretic methods . here",
    "we give an alternative derivation of the christoffel - darboux formula beginning with the stable polynomial @xmath9 .",
    "this is accomplished by examining the orthogonality properties of the polynomial @xmath9 in the space @xmath10 .",
    "these orthogonality properties imbue certain subspaces of @xmath10 with many more orthogonality relations than would appear by just examining the defining relations for these spaces .",

    "we introduce the notation to be used throughout the paper and examine the orthogonality properties of the stable polynomial @xmath9 in the space @xmath10 .",
    "we also list the properties of a sequence of polynomials closely associated with @xmath9 . in section 3",
    "we state , and in section 4 , prove , one of the main results of the paper on the orthogonality of certain subspaces of @xmath10 .",
    "we also establish several follow - up results which are then used in section 5 to derive the christoffel - darboux formula .",
