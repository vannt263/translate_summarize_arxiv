    "the penultimate step in eliminating this uncertainty is to consider the effect of two flavours of sea quark ( @xmath9 ) . here",

    "the ratio @xmath26 appears to be less affected by discretisation effects and is not substantially different from previous quenched calculations .",
    "it should be noted that even a systematic error of 10% for this ratio would be of substantial use for phenomenologists .",
