    "in many practical applications the ultimate goal is to estimate an unknown parameter of interest by using observations acquired by spatially distributed nodes @xcite .",
    "different solutions ( algorithms ) have been introduced in the literature to solve the decentralized estimation problem . in some algorithms ( known as consensus methods ) such as @xcite",
    "the nodes collect all the data first ,",
    "perform local estimation and then interact iteratively with their neighbors . networks that rely on in - network processing at each node while allowing the node to learn with new observations are known as adaptive networks @xcite .",
    "an adaptive network consists of a collection of spatially distributed nodes that are able to communicate with each other through a topology .",
    "two major class of adaptive networks , based on the network topology are incremental networks @xcite or diffusion algorithms @xcite . in the incremental algorithms ,",
    "a cyclic path through the network is established , and nodes communicate with neighbors within this path . in adaptive diffusion implementations ,",
    "information is processed locally at the nodes and then diffused in real - time across the network .",
    "an important factor in learning abilities of adaptive networks is the adaptive filter that is embedded at the nodes .",
    "the mentioned adaptive networks use different types of adaptive filters such as leas meant - square ( lms ) @xcite , recursive least - squares ( rls ) @xcite , affine projection algorithm ( apa ) @xcite and normalized least mean squares ( nlms ) @xcite .",
    "the lms algorithm is a popular choice due to its stability and low complexity . on the other hand ,",
    "the algorithms based on the least squares criterion such as the rls algorithm , converge faster . however , they suffer from the high computational complexity issue @xcite .",
    "the affine projection algorithm has the benefits of both approaches that is stability , low computational complexity and fast convergence @xcite .",
    "the apa was originally introduced for real - value signals @xcite .",
    "the complex domain provides a natural processing framework for signals with intensity and direction components @xcite . statistical signal processing in @xmath0",
    "has traditionally been viewed as a straightforward extension of the corresponding algorithms in the real domain @xmath1 .",
    "however , recent developments in augmented complex statistics show that they do not make full use of the algebraic structure of the complex domain @xcite . for example",
    ", it was shown that the covariance matrix is not sufficient to model the statistics of noncircular signals and it is necessary to introduce the pseudocovariance matrix to fully capture the relation between the real and imaginary components of random vectors .",
    "it is also shown that the standard linear model is only sufficient for modelling proper signals , whereas an optimal model for improper signals is provided by a widely linear model @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned adaptive networks rely on linear model and signal processing in @xmath1 domain . in this paper",
    ", we develop and analyze an incremental adaptive network based on the widely linear model which employs the affine projection algorithm as learning entity to process the complex - valued signals .",
    "the proposed algorithm , which we refer to as incremental augmented affine projection algorithm ( incaapa ) , exploits spatio - temporal diversity to improve the estimation performance .",
    "moreover , at the same time , it employs augmented complex statistics which it turn enables it to process both types of proper and improper signals . to analyze the steady - state performance of the incaapa by resorting to the weighted energy conservation approach and",
    "derive a closed - form expression , in terms of the mean - square deviation ( msd ) that explains how the algorithm performs in the steady - state .",
    "we further derive the stability bound of the proposed algorithm to ensure mean - square convergence .",
    "we use different synthetic benchmark signals including circular complex - valued signal , the noncircular complex - valued signal and noncircular chaotic ikeda map signal in our simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm .",
    "simulation results validate the theoretical results and reveal the advantage of using the proposed algorithm for processing of both second order circular ( proper ) and noncircular ( improper ) signals .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    ", we formulate the estimation problem and derive the proposed algorithm . in section [ sec:3 ] , performance analysis of the incaapa algorithm is provided . in section [ sec:4 ] ,",
