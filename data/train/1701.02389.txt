    "simple life forms dominate our biosphere @xcite and define a lower bound of embodied , self - replicating systems .",
    "but life displays an enormously broad range of complexity levels , affecting many different traits of living entities , from their body size to their cognitive abilities @xcite .",
    "this creates somewhat a paradox : if larger , more complex organisms are more costly to grow and maintain , why is not all life single - celled ? several arguments help provide a rationale for the emergence and persistence of complex life forms . as an instance @xcite proposes that complexity is not a trait explicitly favored by evolution .",
    "a review of fossil records convinces gould that , across genera , phyla , and the whole biosphere , we observe the expected random fluctuations around the more successful adaptation to life . in this big picture , bacteria are the leading life form and the complexity of every other living system is the product of a random drift",
    ". complex life would never be explicitly favored , but a complexity wall exists right below bacteria : simpler forms fail to subsist . hence , a random fluctuation is more likely to produce more complex forms , falsely suggesting that evolution promotes complexity .",
    "major innovations in evolution involve the appearance of new types of agents displaying cooperation while limiting conflict @xcite . a specially important innovation involved the rise of cognitive agents , namely those capable of sensing their environments and reacting to their changes in a highly adaptable way @xcite .",
    "these agents were capable of dealing with more complex , non - genetic forms of information .",
    "the advantages of such cognitive complexity become clear when considering their potential to better predict the environment , thus reducing the average hazards of unexpected fluctuations . as pointed by francois jacob ,",
    "an organism is `` a sort of machine for predicting the future  an automatic forecasting apparatus '' @xcite .",
    "the main message is that _ foreseeing _ the future is a crucial ability to cope with uncertainty .",
    "if the advantages of prediction overcome the problem of maintaining and replicating the costly structures needed for inference , more complex information - processing mechanisms might be favored under the appropriate circumstances .    here",
    "we aim at providing a minimal model that captures these tradeoffs . in doing so",
    ", we characterize thoroughly an evolutionary driver that can push towards evermore complex life forms .",
    "we adopt an information theory perspective in which agents are inference devices interacting with a boolean environment . for convenience , this environment",
    "is represented by a tape with ones and zeros , akin to non - empty inputs of a turing machine ( figure 1*a * ) .",
    "the agent @xmath0 locates itself in a given position and tries to predict each bit of a given sequence of length @xmath1  hence it is dubbed an _",
    "n - guesser_. each attempt to predict a bit involves some cost @xmath2 , while a reward @xmath3 is received for each successful prediction .",

    "a whole @xmath1-bit prediction cycle can be described as a program ( figure 1*b * ) .",
    "a survival function @xmath6 depends on the number of attempts to guess bits and the number of correct predictions .",
    "successful guessers have a positive balance between reward and prediction cost .",
    "they get replicated and pass on their inference abilities .",
    "otherwise , the agent fails to replicate and eventually dies .    as a simple illustration of our approach ,",

    "the average performance of a guesser @xmath0 when trying to infer bits from @xmath7 is given by @xmath11 , the likelihood of emitting a correct guess : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the frequency with which the guesser emits the bit value @xmath14 . a strategy that uses @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( i.e. a guesser that mimics the environment ) makes in average @xmath17 successful predictions .",
    "its survival function reads : @xmath18 this curve trivially dictates the average survival or extinction of @xmath4-guessers as a function of the cost - reward ratio @xmath19 .",
    "note that any more complex guesser ( like the ones described below ) would always fare worst in this case : they would potentially pay a larger cost to infer some structure where none is to be found .",
    "note also that the tunable parameter @xmath20 codes for the severity of the environment .",
    "the idea of autonomy and the fact that predicting the future implies performing some sort of computation suggests that a parsimonious theory of life s complexity needs to incorporate reproducing individuals ( and eventually populations ) and information ( they must be capable of predicting future environmental states ) .",
    "these two components define a conflict and an evolutionary tradeoff .",
    "being too simple means that the external world is perceived as a source of noise .",
    "unexpected fluctuations can be harmful and useful structure can not be harnessed in your benefit . becoming more complex ( hence able to infer larger structures , if they exist ) implies a risk of not being able to gather enough energy to support and replicate the mechanisms for inference . as will be shown below , it is possible to derive the critical conditions to survive as a function of the agent s complexity and to connect these conditions to information theory .",
    "as advanced above , this allows us to characterize mathematically a scenario in which a guesser s complexity is explicitly selected for .",
    "key aspects of information theory relate deeply to formulations in statistical physics @xcite and there have been several calls to further integrate information theory in biological research @xcite .",
    "this theory shall play important roles in population or ecosystems dynamics , in regulatory genomics , and in chemical signal processing among others @xcite , but a unifying approach is far from complete .",
    "given its generality and power , information theory has also been used to address problems that connect darwinian evolution and far from equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite . in its original formulation ,",
    "shannon s information theory @xcite considers symbols being conveyed from a transmitter to a receiver through a channel .",
    "shannon only deals with the efficiency of the channel ( related to its noise or reliability ) and the entropy of the source .",
    "this theory ignores the content of the emitted symbols , despite the limitations of such assumption @xcite .",
    "a satisfactory connection between natural selection and information theory can be obtained by mapping our survival function @xmath6 into shannon s transmitter - receiver scheme .",
    "to do so we consider replicators at an arbitrary generation @xmath21 attempting to `` send '' a message to ( i.e. getting replicated into ) a later generation @xmath22 . a successful `` message ''",
    "thus requires the transmission of information through the survival of the offspring .",
    "the former generation acts as a transmitter , the later becomes the receiver , and the environment and its contingencies constitute the channel through which the embodied message must be conveyed ( figure [ fig:2]*a * ) .",
    "in other words , we can think of a genotype as a generative model ( the instructions in an algorithm ) that produces the message that must be transmitted .",
    "that message would be embodied by a phenotype and it includes every physical process and structure dictated by the generative model .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , any replicating machine must pass on a physically embodied copy of its instructions  hence the phenotype must also include a physical realization of the algorithm encoded by the genotype . finally , any evolutionary pressure ( including the interaction with other replicating signals )",

    "let us instead depart from a replicating message devoid of meaning .",
    "we realize that the channel itself would convey more reliably those messages embodied by a phenotype that better deals with the environmental ( i.e. channel ) conditions .",
    "dysfunctional messages are removed due to natural selection .",
    "efficient signals get more space in successive generations ( figure [ fig:2]*b * ) . through this process",
    "_ meaningful _ bits of environmental information are _ pumped _ into the replicating signals , such that the information in future messages will _ anticipate _ those channel contingencies .",
    "meaningful information is not protected against the channel conditions ( including noise ) , but emerges naturally from them .",
    "let us first introduce our implementation of environments ( channels ) , messages , and two classes of agents : transmitters and receivers .",
    "our replicating agents will be dubbed _ bit - guessers _ because efficient transmission will be equivalent to accurately predicting channel conditions .",
    "the notation may seem arid , so it is good to retain a central picture ( figure [ fig:3 ] ) : guessers @xmath0 posses a generative model @xmath23 that must produce messages that fare well in an environment @xmath7 .",
    "both these messages and the environments are modeled as bit strings .",
    "what follows is a rigorous mathematical characterization of how the different bit sequences are produced .",
    "we consider @xmath24-environments , strings made up of @xmath24 random bits . bits within @xmath24-environments are sorted , so that it matters what bits follow each other . we might consider one given @xmath24-environment ",
    "i.e. one realization ( @xmath7 ) of @xmath24 sorted random bits ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) .",
    "alternatively , we might work with the ensemble ( @xmath28 ) of @xmath24-environments ",

    "we might evaluate the performance of replicating signals and bit guessers in single @xmath24-environments or in the corresponding ensemble .",
    "we introduce @xmath24-environments to model the conditions of the channel through which messages propagate . to attempt to transmit an @xmath1-bit message ( @xmath34 , usually with @xmath35 ) we extract an @xmath1-sized word ( @xmath36 ) from the corresponding environment by picking up the bit at a random position in @xmath7 and the successive @xmath37 bits .",
    "the @xmath38 are compared to the @xmath39 ( with @xmath40 ) and each @xmath41 gets through if @xmath42 . hence attempting to get messages through an environment effectively becomes an inference task : if a guesser can anticipate what bit follows , it has a greater chance of sending messages through , and hence moving into a later generation .    in this paper the generative model @xmath23 of the guessers",
    "is endowed with a minimal ability to react to the environment on the spot ( this mechanism will be explained below ) . instead of conveying a fixed string , @xmath23 builds @xmath34 as a function of the broadcast history : @xmath43 hence , the evaluation of a generative model is rather based on the ensemble of messages that it can produce .",
    "there is a compromise worth investigating between the fidelity of the message that an agent tries to convey and its ability to react to environmental conditions in real time . exploring this tradeoff",
    "is left for future work .",
    "the reaction capabilities of our bit - guessers is kept to a minimum .",
    "usually , a guesser attempts to emit an @xmath1-bit word many ( @xmath44 ) times through the same channel .",
    "for each one of these broadcasts , a new @xmath1-sized word @xmath45 ( with @xmath46 for @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) is extracted from the same environment ",
    "i.e. , as in real life , channel conditions vary .",
    "the manufactured message ensemble becomes @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",

    "otherwise , the inference is reset.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the message - generation process @xmath23 embodied by our @xmath1-guessers could be implemented in different ways , including artificial neural networks ( anns ) @xcite , spiking neurons @xcite , bayesian networks @xcite , turing machines @xcite , markovian chains @xcite , @xmath78-machines @xcite , random boolean networks ( rbns ) @xcite , among others .",
    "these devices elaborate their guesses through a series of algorithms ( e.g. back - propagation , message passing , or hebbian learning ) provided they have access to a sample of their environment .    in the real world ,",
    "trial and error and evolution through natural selection would be the algorithm wiring the message generation processes ( i.e. the genotype ) into our agents .",
    "this would establish some dynamics out of which the relevant inference would emerge , which is a very interesting process .",
    "however , in this paper we aim at understanding the limits imposed by a channel s complexity and the cost of inference ; specially when the performance of the guessers is almost optimal .",
    "therefore , we will assume that our agents perform an almost perfect inference given the environment where they live .",
    "this best inference will be hard - wired in the guesser s generative model of their environment @xmath23 as explained right ahead .    a guesser s generative model usually depends on the environment where it is deployed , so we note @xmath79 .",
    "this @xmath80 will consist of a pool of bits @xmath81 ( figure [ fig:3 ] ) and a series of rules dictating how to emit those bits : either in a predetermined order or as a response to the channel s changing conditions . whenever we pick up an environment @xmath82 ,",
    "the best first guess possible will be the bit ( @xmath8 or @xmath4 ) that shows up with more frequency .",
    "hence : @xmath83 if both @xmath8 and @xmath4 appear equally often we choose @xmath4 without loss of generality .",
    "if the agent succeeds in its first guess , its safest next bet is to emit the bit ( @xmath8 or @xmath4 ) that more frequently follows @xmath84 in the environment .",
    "we proceed similarly if the first two bits have been correctly guessed , if the first three bits have been correctly guessed , etc .",
    "we define @xmath85 as the probability of finding @xmath86 at the @xmath87-th position of the @xmath65 word extracted from the environment , provided that the guess so far is correct : @xmath88 the index @xmath72 , in this case , labels all @xmath1-sized words within the environment @xmath89 and @xmath90 is a normalization constant that depends on how many words in the environment match @xmath80 up to the ( @xmath91)th bit : @xmath92 it follows : @xmath93    note that the pool of bits in @xmath80 consists of an @xmath1-sized word , which is what they try to emit through ( i.e. it constitutes the guess about ) the channel .",
    "if a guesser would not be able to react to environmental conditions , the word @xmath34 that is actually generated at every emission would be the same in every case and @xmath94 always ; but we also allow our guessers a minimal reaction if one of the bits fails to get through the channel ( i.e. if one of the guesses is not correct ) . this minimal reaction capacity by our guessers results in : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the largest @xmath87 at which @xmath97 .",
    "this means that a guesser restarts the broadcast of @xmath80 whenever it makes a mistake .    all together , our guesser consists of a generative model @xmath23 that contains a pool of bits and a simple conditional instruction .",
    "this is reflected in the flow chart in figure [ fig:3 ] .",
    "coming back to biology , and as noted above , the generative model is akin to a genotype and the resulting bits emitted as guesses about the channel would make up a phenotype .",
    "+ we have made a series of choices regarding how to implement environmental conditions .",
    "these choices about implementation affect the way some randomness enters the model ( reflected in the fact that , given an environment @xmath7 , a guesser might come across different words @xmath36 ) and also how we implement our guessers ( including their minimal adaptability to wrong bits ) . we came up with a scheme that codes guessers , the environment ( or channel ) , and the messages transmitted as bit strings .",
    "this allows us a direct measurement of information - theoretical features which are suitable for our discussion , but the conclusions at which we arrive should be general : survival will depend on a replicator s ability to extract useful information from the channel ( encoded in the message that it conveys from one generation to the next one ) , and on the cost - efficiency tradeoff related to _ how meaningful _ bits are .",
    "because of the minimal implementation discussed , all guessers of the same size are equal . environmental ensembles of a given size are considered equivalent as well .",
    "hence , the notation is not affected if we identify guessers and environments by their sizes .",
    "accordingly , in the following we substitute the labels @xmath0 and @xmath7 by the more informative ones @xmath1 and @xmath24 respectively . hence @xmath98 becomes @xmath99 , @xmath11 becomes @xmath100 , etc .",
    "we report a series of numerical experiments . some of them deal with guessers in environment ensembles of fixed size , others allow guessers to switch between environment sizes to find a place where to thrive .",
    "the important message is that the complexity of the guessers that can populate a given environment ( i.e. the complexity of the most successful messages traversing the corresponding channel ) is tuned by the predictability of the environment .",
    "environment sizes exist at which simple guessers die off but in which more complex life flourishes  thus offering an explanation to real - life excursions beyond bare replicative success .",
    "our scheme allows us to quantify the different aspects involved in the tradeoff , and to characterize this evolutionary pressure behind complex replicators .",
    "finally , some of the simulations engage @xmath1-guessers with different @xmath1 in direct competition with each other . yet",
    "other experiments explore what may happen if resources could get exhausted .",

    "importantly , the predictability of shorter words decays faster than that of larger ones , thus enabling guessers with larger @xmath1 to survive where others would perish .",
    "there are @xmath105 possible @xmath1-words , of which @xmath24 are realized in each @xmath24-environment . when @xmath106 , the environment implements an efficient , ergodic sampling of all @xmath1-words  thus making them maximally unpredictable .",
    "when @xmath107 the sampling of @xmath1-sized words is far from ergodic and a non - trivial structure is induced in the environment because the symmetry between @xmath1-sized words is broken  they can not be equally represented due to finite size sampling effects .",
    "this allows that complex guessers ( those with the ability to contemplate larger words , keep them in memory , and make choices regarding information encoded in larger strings ) can guess more bits , in average , than simpler agents . in terms of messages crossing the channel , while shorter words are meaningless and basically get transmitted ( i.e. are correctly guessed ) by chance alone , larger words might contain meaningful , non - trivial information that get successfully transmitted because they cope with the environment in the adequate way .    note that this symmetry breaking to favor predictability of larger words is just a mechanism that allows us to introduce correlations in a controlled and measurable way . in the real world",
    "this mechanism might correspond to asymmetries between dynamical systems in temporal or spatial scales . although our implementation is rather ad hoc ( suitable to our computational and conceptual needs )",

    "there is a range ( @xmath145 ) within which guessers are alive but do not replicate .",
    "figure [ fig:7]*a * and * b * show @xmath146 with @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "note that for large environments all guessers combined do not add up to @xmath133 ",
    "i.e. mostly empty slots remain and most guessers get extinguished .",

    "+ an alternative evolutionary pressure is introduced if the bits in the environment represent resources that might get exhausted .",
    "thinking from the message broadcasting perspective , a spot on the channel might appear crowded if it is engaged in a successful transmission .",
    "assume that every time that a bit is correctly guessed , it gets exhausted ( or gets crowded ) with an efficiency @xmath150 so that in average each bit can not contribute any reward @xmath151 of the time .",
    "the average reward extracted by a guesser from an ensemble ( figure [ fig:8 ] ) becomes : @xmath152 smaller guessers living in very small environments quickly crowd their channels ( alternatively , exhaust the resources they depend on ) . in figure [ fig:8]*b",
    "* given some @xmath20 and @xmath153 , @xmath4- and @xmath130-guessers can only survive within some under and upper limits ( figure [ fig:8]*b * ) . as announced above",
    ", this might establish evolutionary incentives to explore more complex scenarios even if some guesser has its needs already satisfied in a simple environment .",
    "in this paper we have considered a fundamental question related to the emergence of complexity in living systems .",
    "the problem being addressed here is how more complex organisms can overcome the cost of their complexity by developing a higher potential to predict the external environment . as suggested by several authors @xcite the behavioral plasticity provided by the exploratory behavior of living systems",
    "can be understood it terms of their potential for dealing with environmental information @xcite .",
    "our models make an explicit approach by considering a replication - predictability tradeoff under very general assumptions , namely : ( a ) more complex environments look more unpredictable to simpler replicators and ( b ) agents that can keep a larger memory and make inferences based on more elaborated information can extract enough valuable bits from the environment as to survive in those more challenging situations . despite the inevitable cost inherent to the cognitive machinery , a selection process towards more complex life",
    "is shown to occur .",
    "this offers an explicit evolutionary pressure towards more complex life forms .    in our study",
    "we identify a transmitter ( replicators at a given generation ) , a receiver ( replicators at the next generation ) , and a channel ( _ any _ environmental conditions ) through which a message ( ideally instructions about how to build newer replicators ) is passed on .",
    "darwinian evolution follows naturally as effective replicators transit a channel faster and more reliably thus getting more and more space in successive generations .",
    "the inference task is implicit as the environment itself codes for meaningful bits of information that , if picked up by the replicators , boost the fitness of the phenotypes embodied by the successful messages .",
    "this view is directly inspired by a qualitative earlier picture introduced in @xcite .",
    "that metaphor assigned to the dna some external meaning that had to be preserved _ against _ the environmental noise .",
    "contrary to this , we propose that , as messages attempt to travel from a generation to the next one , all channel conditions ( including noise ) pump relevant bits into the transmitted strings  hence there is no need to protect meaning against the channel .",
    "the way that we introduce correlations in our scheme ( through a symmetry breaking between the information borne by short and larger words due to finite size effects ) is compatible with this view .",
    "however , interestingly , it also suggests that meaningful information might arise naturally even in highly unstructured environments when different spatial and temporal scales play a relevant role .",
    "this way of integrating information theory and darwiniand evolution is convenient to analyze the questions at hand that concern the emergence of complex life forms .",
    "but it also opens further research questions .",
    "as discussed at the beginning of the paper , guessers and their transmissible messages might and should shape the transmission channel ( e.g. , by crowding it , as explored briefly in section [ sec:3.2 ] ) . what possible co - evolutionary dynamics between guessers and channels can be established ?",
    "are there stable ones , others leading to extinction , etc ?",
    "do some of them , perhaps , imply open - ended evolution ? which ones ? also , a guesser s transmitted message might be considered an environment in itself , opening the door to ecosystem modeling based on bare information theory .",
    "it is also suggested the exploration of different symbiotic relationships from this perspective and how they might affect coevolution .",
    "finally , an important question was left aside that concerns the memory vs adaptability tradeoff of bit guessers .",
    "here we studied guessers with a minimal adaptability to focus on the emerging hierarchy of complexity .",
    "adaptability at faster ( say , at behavioral ) temporal scales is linked to more complex inferences with richer dynamics .",
    "this brings in new dilemmas as to how to weight the different building blocks of complex inference ",
    "e.g. how do we compare memory and _ if - else _ or _ while _ instructions ? these and other questions are left for exploration in future research .",
