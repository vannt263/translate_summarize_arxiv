    "they correspond to points where the optical field amplitude vanishes and the optical phase becomes undefined . near the singular point , the optical phase changes continuously with a specific _ topological charge _ , given by the phase change in units of @xmath0 along a closed path surrounding the singularity @xcite .",
    "beams with optical vortices carry orbital angular momentum ( oam ) , which is simply proportional to the topological charge when the vortex is located on the beam axis @xcite .    when also the vectorial nature of the optical field is taken into account , the variety of possible singular points in the transverse plane",

    "have been given various names in the literature , such as for example ( full)-poincar beams @xcite . here , we simply call them `` _ _ polarization - singular beams _ _ '' ( psb )",
    ". the psb may have different transverse polarization patterns , characterized by a different integer or half - integer topological index @xmath4 as defined by the variation of the polarization ellipse orientation for a closed path around a c - point , such as `` star '' , `` monstar '' , `` lemon '' , `` spiral '' ( with a central `` source / sink '' singularity ) , `` hyperbolic '' ( with a central `` saddle '' singularity ) , etc .",

    "polarization singularities are typically generated either by interferometric methods ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which is usually very delicate and unstable , or by propagation through suitable birefringent solid crystals ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , a method which does not lend itself to a flexible control of the output . in this paper , we study the generation and propagation dynamics of vectorial polarization singular beams generated by `` q - plates '' @xcite , i.e. birefringent liquid crystal cells having a singular pattern of the optical axis . in a recent work , we have reported the generation of singular vortex beams with uniform polarization ellipticity and a central vortex singularity with vanishing intensity , as generated by `` tuned '' q - plates @xcite . here , by exploiting `` untuned '' q - plates , we conveniently generate and control beams having a space - variant polarization ellipticity , with a central c - point singularity , and a lemon , star or spiral ellipse - orientation pattern .",
