    "this tail is physically associated with the presence of the quantum depletion of the condensate , a challenging feature well understood theoretically , but difficult to measure experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 tail of the momentum distribution has been measured in the unitary fermi gas , profiting of the possibility of turning off the interaction , just after the release of the trap  @xcite . in this case",
    "the momentum distribution is conserved during the expansion , so that experiments measure the value of the contact before expansion . despite the systematic investigations of the contact at equilibrium  @xcite , its evolution in a dynamical context has been rarely explored  @xcite .",
    "the importance of this question is manifested by the fact that the momentum distribution is affected by interactions during the expansion and , for large expansion times , when it becomes time - independent , can be directly related to the measurable time - dependent density distribution @xmath7 through the ballistic relationship @xmath8 according to eq.([eq : ballistic ] ) , an asymptotic @xmath0 tail in the momentum distribution should show up in a tail of the density distribution , characterized by the @xmath9 dependence for large values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "a recent experiment  @xcite , where the density distribution of an expanding gas of metastable @xmath1he atoms was measured with high accuracy , has indicated that the contact parameter @xmath6 is actually increased with respect to the initial value , and thus motivated us for the theoretical investigation of the dynamical evolution of the contact .",

    "approximate schemes based on scaling transformations  @xcite or on the hydrodynamic picture  @xcite provide an accurate description of the expansion and , in particular , have proven very successful in predicting the time dependence of the aspect ratio , a quantity measurable with high precision .    the description of the expansion at a more microscopic level , involving the large-@xmath5 components of the momentum distribution , represents a more challenging problem , whose solution requires the implementation of time - dependent dynamic theories beyond the mean field level .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to discuss some examples where such theories can be worked out explicitly and the question of the behavior of the tails of the momentum distribution can be addressed in a quantitative way at zero temperature .",
    "these include the unitary fermi gas , the weakly interacting bose gas and the two - body problem with highly asymmetric mass imbalance which reduces the problem to the solution of the single - particle schrdinger equation .",

    "a remarkable feature exhibited by the fermi gas at unitarity is that an exact solution of the problem of the expansion from a three - dimensional ( 3d ) isotropic harmonic trap can be formulated in terms of the exact scaling transformation  @xcite @xmath14 of the many - body wave - function . here",

    "this behavior is ruled out by the simple argument that no natural cut - off exists in coordinate space at large @xmath10 and that the @xmath2 law would imply an unphysical infrared divergent behavior in the ground state harmonic oscillator energy .    an explicit expression for the time dependence of the contact",
    "can be obtained by making the adiabatic ansatz  @xcite .",
    "this ansatz corresponds to assuming that , during the expansion , the large momentum component of the momentum distribution is given by the same expression @xmath26 holding at equilibrium , with @xmath27 evaluated using the time dependent value of the density profile .",

    "it is worth noticing that the same analytic result ( eq .  ( [ eq : asym_unitary ] ) ) for the asymptotic momentum distribution and for the time dependence of the contact can be also derived by studying the behavior of the one - body density matrix ( see appendix  [ appdenx1 ] ) .",

    "more complete and explicit results for the time evolution of the contact are available by solving the expansion dynamics of a two - body problem , which gives access to the exact time - dependence of the density and momentum distributions and provides explicit conditions for the applicability of the adibaticity ansatz . for the sake of brevity , we consider two interacting particles in an isotropic 3d harmonic trap with one of them being so heavy that the center - of - mass motion can be ignored .",
