    "point contact spectroscopy @xcite is a versatile technique widely used to study the basic properties of superconductors , such as the density of states at the fermi level and the superconducting energy gap .",
    "the technique consists in establishing a contact between a tip of a normal metal ( n ) and a superconducting sample ( s ) , thus forming a small contact area that is a `` point contact '' junction . by varying the distance and/or the pressure between tip and sample it is possible to obtain different tunnel barriers , that is different conductance regimes .",
    "indeed , quasiparticle tunnel spectroscopy is obtained for high barriers , while point contact andreev reflection ( pcar ) spectroscopy is achieved in case of low barriers . often in the experiments , intermediate regimes",
    "are realized , in which through the n / s contact both quasi - particle tunneling and andreev reflection processes occur .",
    "andreev reflections @xcite take place at the n / s interface when an electron , propagating in the normal metal with an energy lower than the superconducting energy gap , enters in the superconductor forming an electron pair ( cooper pair ) while a hole , with opposite momentum with respect to the incident electron , is reflected in the normal metal .",
    "a single reflection corresponds to a net charge transfer of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the electron charge , from the normal metal to the superconductor . in the limit of low barriers at low temperatures , all the incident electrons at the n / s interface with energy @xmath11",
    "are andreev reflected and the conductance doubles the normal states value .",
    "in this paper we report on pcar studies carried out in the hybrid rutheno - cuprate rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( ru-1212 ) system @xcite .",
    "this compound has recently drawn great attention among theorists and experimentalists in the field of solid state physics due to the coexistence at low temperatures of superconducting and magnetic ordering @xcite .",
    "the ru-1212 structure is similar to that of yba@xmath0cu@xmath12o@xmath13 with magnetic ( _ 2d _ ) ruo@xmath0 planes substituting the ( _ 1d _ ) cu - o chains .",
    "the superconducting critical temperature in this compound strongly depends on the preparation conditions with some reports showing transition onset as high as @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the ru-1212 also shows a magnetic phase below @xmath15 .",
    "it has been reported that the magnetic order of the ru moments is predominantly antiferromagnetic along the _ c _ axis @xcite , while a ferromagnetic component has been observed in the ruo@xmath0 planes , that act as charge reservoir @xcite . at the moment , due to complexity of this compound , an exhaustive description of the interaction between the magnetic and superconducting layers is still missing as well as an unambiguous evaluation of the symmetry of the energy gap .",

    "indeed , a close comparison of the calculated conductance spectra is useful for a better understanding of the peculiar transport processes that occur at an n / s interface depending on the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "following the original paper , we write the expression of the differential conductance characteristics for a n / s contact that , according to the btk model@xcite , is given by : @xmath17\\left[-\\frac{df(e+ev)}{d(ev)}\\right]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the applied potential , @xmath19 is the normal conductance expressed in term of @xmath20 , a dimensionless parameter modeling the barrier strength , _",

    "however , the remarkably low values of the energy gap @xmath124 and of the ratio @xmath125 indicate major differences between the ru-1212 and the high @xmath96 cuprates . we speculate that the presence of ferromagnetic order within the superconducting phase results in an effective reduction of the energy gap .",
    "we have also demonstrated that , when dealing with granular samples , intergrain coupling effects can play a predominant role . in some cases , an intergrain josephson junction in series with the point contact junction is formed .",
    "taking into account this feature as well , all conductance spectra have been properly modeled by considering a _ d - wave _ symmetry of the order parameter , with consistent values of the amplitude of the energy gap .    by fixing all the fitting parameters to their values at the lowest measured temperature , and by varying @xmath6 ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the energy gap has been extracted from the conductance characteristics of a very stable junction .",
    "we have found that the energy gap exhibits a sub - linear dependence in temperature .",
    "the magnetic field behavior of the spectra has been also studied , showing a linear reduction of the energy gap for fields up to @xmath59 t , from which a critical field @xmath126 t is inferred .",
    "we have found that both the superconducting features and the normal background in the conductance spectra do not show any hysteresis in magnetic field .",
    "these observations seem to suggest a weak coupling between the superconducting and magnetic order parameter .",
    "our analysis may be helpful for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms enabling high temperature superconductivity , and its interplay with magnetic order in unconventional superconductors like rutheno - cuprates .",
