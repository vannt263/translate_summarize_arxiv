    "the late - time accelerated expansion of the universe has forced cosmologists to revise our understanding of the universe either by introducing a new component in the universe called dark energy @xcite or by modifying directly the laws of gravity @xcite . within the framework of friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmology , we can account for a phase of accelerated expansion by simply introducing a cosmological constant ( @xmath4 ) , even though this model gives rise to severe coincidence and fine - tuning problems , observations are still consistent with a dark energy component that has the same characteristics of the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these experiments are not able to give us information either on the variation on time of a dark energy component or on the _ clustering properties _ of such dark energy component . moreover",
    ", recent observations do not have a sufficient sensitivity to be able to distinguish between a dark energy component or a modified gravity model ; even though the two classes of models can be arbitrarily alike , see @xcite , it is still important to be able to discard some of the model that manifests a different behaviour .",
    "furthermore , future experiments have been planned to collect a large amount of data with high accuracy and it would be interesting to find tests that are able to confirm our assumptions .",
    "consistency checks are usually model independent tests able to determine if the assumptions made are violated . in this paper",

    ", we introduced a new null - test specifically for the growth of matter perturbations and , as far as we know , this is the first null - test that accounts for perturbations on the matter fluids .",
    "the evolution of the matter density contrast is governed by the evolution of the hubble parameter and by the evolution of all the other clustering components @xcite .",
    "hence it is a complementary probe for the dark energy because , while many different dark energy models give the same expansion history they usually differ at perturbation level ( depending on the intrinsic characteristics of the fluid itself ) and they will affect the evolution of the matter density contrast .",
    "moreover , as it is well known , modified gravity models can also be reinterpreted as effective dark energy models with their own _ effective perturbed quantities _ and consequently the growth of matter density will be influenced by these _ effective _ perturbations ; see @xcite .",
    "hence , it was necessary to find a null - test that accounted for the growth of matter density fields .    finally , the paper is organized as follows : in sec . [ settings ]",

    "if we test the mock catalogs , we get a result that it consistent with @xmath182 already at @xmath112 , see tab .  [",
    "tab : nulltest - results - binning - mocks ] , when we use a different mock catalog for instance the @xmath16cdm one then @xmath113 is less than @xmath182 at more than @xmath183 s at almost any redshift , which is the result that we would expect as the growth of the matter density contrast increases because of the dark energy perturbations .",
    "using the @xmath1 mocks the null - test gives values closer to unity indicating that it will be more difficult to differentiate the and the @xmath1 model ; this is due to the fact that the @xmath1 model used in this paper has a hubble parameter which is exactly and an @xmath63 of @xmath184 , hence the modification to the growth @xmath98 is small .",
    "when we use the mocks from @xmath2 and ltb cosmologies , which both models give substantially different behavior of the hubble parameter and the growth of matter density contrast , the deviation from unity of the null - test @xmath113 becomes more evident , in fact we found that the @xmath2 can be ruled out at more than @xmath185 s and the ltb at more than @xmath186 s .",
    "the results up to @xmath187 can be found in tab .",
    "[ tab : nulltest - results - binning - mocks-10bins ] .",
    "an interesting alternative to binning is to fit the data , either real or mock , to the @xmath4cdm and @xmath16cdm models and then reconstruct the null - test @xmath113 . in fig .",

    "next , we will also test how well the null - test will be reconstructed with future data . for this",
    ", we also consider the different cosmologies mentioned in a previous section and fit the mocks with both the and @xmath16cdm models .",
    "the reason for this is that we want to make a direct test of the standard cosmological model with as few extra assumptions as possible .",
    "we should stress that in this case any deviation from unity implies a breakdown of either the fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model , i.e. homogeneity , the validity of gr etc , or that the de models used are not a good description of the data .    in fig .",

    "[ fig : modelsmocks2 ] ) , but also deviations from the frw metric ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ltbmocks ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that these models have significantly different evolution for the matter density perturbations , which is encoded in the @xmath15 and can be detected by the null - test .",
    "+   +     +   +      as an extra check we also use alternative data instead of just the @xmath0 , namely the supernovae type ia ( snia ) to reconstruct the hubble parameter .",
    "in particular we used the latest _",
    "union 2.1 _ set of 580 snia data of suzuki et al .",
    "@xcite that spans from redshift @xmath192 up to @xmath193 .",
    "the results for this reconstruction are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcdmsniarealvsmock ] for the and in fig .",
    "[ fig : wcdmsniarealvsmock ] for the @xmath16cdm .",
    "we find that they are in excellent agreement with that of the @xmath0 data shown earlier , thus eliminating any possibility of bias due to the use of the particular data used to reconstruct the hubble expansion history .",
    "finally , we also consider @xmath1 models in the reconstruction of the null - test .",
    "specifically , in fig . [ fig : frrealsniavshz ] we show the results for the null - test for the @xmath1 model for the real snia and 8 data ( left ) and the @xmath0 and 8 data data ( right ) .",
    "again the results are in good agreement , thus demonstrating that the null - test is not particularly sensitive on the model used .",
    "+     +      it should be noted that unfortunately , none of the @xmath98 data used in this analysis has been evaluated in a completely model independent manner . usually an underlying cosmology has to be considered in order to extract information about the growth rate parameter , and most of the time this cosmology is the @xmath4cdm .",
    "another limitation of the @xmath53 data is that part of the measurement comes from a range of wave numbers that falls into the nonlinear regime , with the typical scales ranging from @xmath194 up to @xmath195 mpc / h , which expressed as a wavenumber is @xmath196 h / mpc .",
    "the maximum wavenumber that we can reach before entering into the non linear regime depends on the redshift of the measurements ; starting from @xmath197 h / mpc at @xmath198 up to @xmath199 h / mpc at high redshifts ( above @xmath182 ) .",
    "most surveys @xcite already do take into account non - linearities via the non linear bao diffusion .",
    "the latter is usually treated as a `` nuisance '' parameter , which will be marginalized over as it does not depend on the cosmology , and by doing so the cosmological information comes only from the linear part of the power spectrum .",
    "moreover , the growth rate @xmath200 is a linear quantity because is directly proportional to the velocity perturbations @xmath201 with no scale dependence .",
    "clearly there is still a lot room for improvement in order to have completely model independent and better measurements of the growth index .",
    "it should be stressed however , that this problem with the data could potentially be resolved in the near future if the data can be created with more model independent techniques , thus alleviating this constraint from our null - test .      in this subsection",
    "we will briefly discuss another issue , that of the potential problem that the @xmath0 data might originate from a different cosmology but the growth @xmath202 data has been evaluated under the assumption of .",
    "for instance , the later time scale independent growth could be generated by @xmath1 gravity theory , but some of analysis assumed the coherent growth and then what it is measured is the mean @xmath203 in the valid @xmath204 bins .",
    "above all , uncertainties due to the non - linear or non - perturbed terms prevail through those measurements and as a result , we are not able to test anything other than simple gr models . therefore , if one wants to constrain a specific theoretical model , such as @xmath1 or @xmath2 , he / she should analyze the data based upon the model - dependent method .    however , our test is very sensitive to variations of cosmologies or , in other terms , in tensions in the data , as in this particular case .",
    "an interesting game - test is the following : let us imagine we have a data set of @xmath0 measured in a model independent way and they favor a @xmath16cdm model ; then we have a different data set of @xmath205 measured assuming a model ( in this case ) so these data are clearly biased as they will favor a model rather than the true underlying cosmology ( which is @xmath16cdm with perturbations also in the dark energy sector ) .",
    "so we can think to use these two different data sets with the null - test : in practice , in order to quantify the sensitivity of our null - test , we use a mock catalog for h(z ) using the @xmath16cdm model and another mock catalog using for @xmath205 using the model .",
    "we notice that the null - test deviates from unity at the level of about @xmath206 ( @xmath207 ) and in average of about @xmath208 .",
    "we can also ask how much @xmath205 itself deviates using the wrong cosmology and test which is more sensitive .",
    "we find that for @xmath205 for the two different cosmologies , i.e. for and @xmath16cdm , the difference between the @xmath205 evaluated using two different cosmologies is of about @xmath209 and in average of about @xmath210 .",
    "we can also have a closer look at the errors on the null - test mixing - up two different cosmologies . implementing the full error propagation analysis",
    "we realize that the errors remain basically unchanged when we mix up the two different cosmologies ; the reason is that the error propagation formula does not change and the important quantities are the errors on the measured quantity , i.e. @xmath0 , @xmath98 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tension - in - data ] we plot the null - test using @xmath4cdm and @xmath16cdm mock catalogs and the null - test mixing the cosmologies .",
    "in this paper we have reconstructed the null - test , that can be used to probe potential deviations from and was first presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , by using the @xmath0 , snia and 8 data .",
    "we performed the reconstruction in two different ways : by directly binning the data and by fitting the data to various dark energy models like the and @xmath16cdm and then calculating the null - test .",
    "we find that both methods have different advantages ; the former uses as few assumptions as possible while the latter directly tests the standard cosmological model .",
    "we have also generalized the null - test and extended it for modified gravity models and models with strong de perturbations , by taking into account the @xmath15 term in eq .",
    "( [ ode ] ) .",
    "we have explicitly checked that when this term is taken into account , then the null - test is constant as expected for modified gravity models .",
    "this allows us to verify that deviations from unity in the original version of the null - test presented in ref .",
    "@xcite can indeed also be attributed to modifications of gravity .    we have found that deviations from unity could be due to several reasons , either new physics including modifications of gravity and strong dark energy perturbations , or breakdowns of one of the basic assumptions of the standard cosmological model , i.e. deviation from the flrw metric and homogeneity or finally , a possible tension between @xmath0 ( obtained directly or derived ) and the @xmath53 data . in all cases due to the nature of the null - tests and that they have to be constant at all redshifts , it is enough to a have a statistically significant deviation at one redshift to detect one of the above reasons .",
    "a possible limitation at the moment is that the null - test can not tell us which of the above reasons would be responsible for that deviation though .",
    "however , our growth null - test will be extremely useful if joined with other null - tests , like the @xmath26 presented in @xcite which is able to test the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy of the universe .",
    "we also examined how well the null - test can be reconstructed by future data by creating mock catalogs based on a lsst - like survey and on the model , a model with strong de perturbations , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 models , and the large void ltb model that exhibit different evolution of the matter perturbations .",
    "this was done so as to examine how well our null - test can be reconstructed using the data from upcoming surveys .",
    "our results were presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : binrealvsmock - null]-[fig : frrealsniavshz ] .",
    "we found that when reconstructed with real data the null - test is consistent with unity at the @xmath183 level , with both the binning and the model testing methods .",
    "however , when we reconstruct it with the mock data based on the specifications of a lsst - like survey and various models that go beyond the , ie the @xmath1 , @xmath2 models and the ltb , we find that the null - test can detect deviations from unity at the @xmath3 and also @xmath186 level .",
    "overall , the novelty of our null - test is that it can directly test the fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model with as few assumptions as possible .",

    "<S> we systematically study the null - test for the growth rate data first presented in @xcite and we reconstruct it using various combinations of data sets , such as the 8 and @xmath0 or type ia supernovae ( snia ) data . </S>",
    "<S> we perform the reconstruction in two different ways , either by directly binning the data or by fitting various dark energy models . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine how well the null - test can be reconstructed by future data by creating mock catalogs based on the cosmological constant model , a model with strong dark energy perturbations , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 models , and the large void ltb model that exhibit different evolution of the matter perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that with future data similar to an lsst - like survey , the null - test will be able to successfully discriminate between these different cases at the @xmath3 level . </S>"
