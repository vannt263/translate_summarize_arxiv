    "the astounding growth of smart mobile device popularity , coupled with new types of wireless services and applications , such as internet of things and mobile cyber - physical applications , has helped usher in the era of wireless big data @xcite .",
    "futuristic high speed networks such as tactile internet @xcite will enable numerous new services and allow for new experiences , e.g. , autonomous driving , healthcare , and virtual reality .",
    "however , the rapidly growing data and diversified services will put great strain on both storage and computation @xcite in wireless communication systems .",
    "this calls for a paradigm shift for wireless access technologies to provide services with the stringent requirements of ultra - low latency , high data rate , as well as massive connectivity @xcite .    by leveraging mobile edge / fog computing concepts @xcite , the recent proposal of fog radio access network ( fog - ran ) @xcite represents a disruptive wireless network architecture to accommodate the upcoming diversified services with ultra - low latency and high data rates",
    "this is achieved by pushing the computation and storage resources to network edges , thereby enabling cloud computation within wireless networks as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fog - ran ] .    specifically , in fog - ran , each radio access unit ( rau ) hosts storage and computation entities , thereby pushing data and its processing closer to end users .",
    "this cache enabled network architecture promises to reduce network congestion for wireline communication scenarios @xcite and enhance interference coordination in wireless communication networks @xcite . by further pushing the content and computation resources to smart mobile devices ( mds ) ,",
    "end - to - end latency and network capacity can be improved , e.g. , in cache - aided wireless device - to - device ( d2d ) networks @xcite . in particular , for wearable computing applications , offloading computation - intensive applications to proximal smart mobile devices or raus can significantly improve roundtrip delay and energy efficiency @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we mainly focus on the content - centric communication and edge storage aspects of fog - ran .",
    "the fundamental goal is to leverage the network caching capability for efficient content delivery , thereby reducing end - to - end network latency . to understand this problem",
    ", we derive unified interference alignment conditions for content delivery for wireline links between fog server and raus , and also for wireless links between raus and smart mobile devices .",
    "surprisingly , caching problem with fixed side information is equivalent to the index coding @xcite problem , which is equivalent to many other important problems , including topological interference management ( tim ) and network coding @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , index coding is an np - hard problem and only a few special cases can been solved efficiently .    in this paper , we present a low - rank matrix completion ( lrmc ) approach @xcite to minimize message delivery latency by exploiting side information provided by the caching capability .",
    "the low - rank modeling framework has wide applications in machine learning , computational big data analytics , high - dimensional statistics .",
    "furthermore , the lrmc approach has recently been exploited to solve the wireless topological interference management problem @xcite and index coding problem @xcite .",
    "however , these existing works mainly focus on unicast , in which each message is desired by exactly one destination , whereas in the caching problem each message may be desired by multiple destinations . despite of the np - hardness of the resulting lrmc problem",
    ", we will reveal that the modeling framework provides algorithmic opportunities .",
    "although our problem falls within the category of low - rank matrix completion , which has stimulated a flurry of recent research activities @xcite , most prior works are not applicable in our lrmc problem because of their special affine constraint and measurement graph structures . specifically , the well - known convex relaxation approach by replacing the rank function to the nuclear norm @xcite will always yield a full - rank solution in the unicast case , which turns out to be invalid here .",
    "furthermore , alternating minimization approaches @xcite also exhibit their own limitations such as slow convergence rate , and impractical assumptions ( e.g. , incoherence of the original matrix ) , and available ( estimated ) ground - truth rank .",
    "one exception is the conjugate gradient based riemannian pursuit algorithm @xcite , which explores the embedded manifold structures of fixed - rank matrices to design rank estimation strategies .",
    "however , the first - order method has slow convergence and is sensitive to initial points .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a riemannian trust - region optimization framework @xcite to provide high accuracy solutions and faster convergence rate for finding the minimal rank in the lrmc problem .",
    "this second - order algorithm is more robust to initial point choices , and can obtain reliable solutions .",
    "we first solve the fixed - rank matrices , by exploiting the quotient manifold geometry of the search space of fixed - rank matrices @xcite .",
    "we then develop an efficient rank increase mechanism to estimate the minimum rank while satisfying the affine constraint .",
    "this is achieved by exploiting the closure of fixed - rank matrices .",
    "numerical results will show that our proposed algorithm can recover existing optimal dof results in  @xcite and outperform state - of - art algorithms .",
    "consider a cache - aided fog - ran as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fog - ran ] , where both raus and smart devices have caching capabilities . to evaluate the benefits of caching in raus",

    "we shall present that the message delivery problems are equivalent to the index coding problem with fixed side information @xcite .      consider a wireline communication network between the fog data center and cache - enabled raus as shown in fig .",

    ", we are interested in constructing the vector linear coding schemes over real field to maximize the message delivery rate .",
    "specifically , the transmitted symbol sequence @xmath8 over @xmath9 channel uses is given by @xmath10 here , message @xmath11 is split into @xmath12 scalar data streams , denoted as @xmath13_{i=1}^{q_m}\\in\\mathbb{r}^{q_m\\times1}$ ] , and each of which carries one symbol from @xmath14 and is transmitted along the column vectors of the precoding matrix @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 with @xmath17 be the receiver combining matrix at rau @xmath5 for the desired message @xmath18 .",
    "we have the following decoding operation for message @xmath18 at rau @xmath5 : @xmath19 to accomplish the above decoding , we impose the following interference alignment conditions @xcite : @xmath20 the first condition ( [ con1 ] ) is to align and cancel the interference , and the second condition ( [ con2 ] ) is to preserve the desired signal .",
    "therefore , if ( [ con1 ] ) ( [ con2 ] ) can both be satisfied over @xmath9 channel uses , the message delivery rate tuple @xmath21 can be achieved . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath22 , we say that the symmetric data rate is @xmath23 .",
    "thus the smaller @xmath9 we can achieve , the lower latency we can realize . note that , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 , we include the multiple unicast scenario as a special case @xcite .",
    "we also observe that the caching problem with fixed side information ( i.e. , cached message ) is equivalent to the index coding problem @xcite .",
    "recently , caching in content - centric wireless networks is a very popular topic @xcite .",

    "as dof provides a first - order characterization for capacity , we shall minimize channel uses @xmath9 to improve the message delivery data rate .",
    "in this section , we present a low - rank matrix completion modeling framework to find the minimal number of channel uses such that the interference alignment conditions ( [ con1 ] ) and ( [ con2 ] ) can be satisfied .",
    "specifically , let @xmath42 .",
    "without lose of generality , we set @xmath43 .",
    "we thus can restrict @xmath44 s to the real field without losing any performance in terms of achievable dofs @xcite .",
