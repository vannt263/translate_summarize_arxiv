    "current observational data favor the locally homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmological models as approximate descriptions of our universe at least since the recombination time .",
    "thus in the framework of the general relativity theory it can be described through a robertson - walker ( rw ) metric @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a cosmic time , and @xmath2 $ ] with @xmath3 depending on the sign of the constant spatial curvature ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "these descriptions , however , are only local and do not fix the global shape ( topology ) of our universe .    despite the infinitely many possibilities for its global topology",
    ", it is often assumed that spacetime is simply - connected leaving aside the hypothesis that the universe may be multiply - connected , and compact ( finite ) even in the cases @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in other words , it is often assumed that the @xmath7 spatial sections @xmath8 of a rw spacetime manifold are one of the following simply - connected spaces : euclidean @xmath9 ( @xmath5 ) , elliptic @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , or the hyperbolic @xmath12 ( @xmath6 ) . however , the connectedness ( either simply or multiply ) for our three - space has not been settled by cosmological observations .",
    "thus , the space @xmath8 where we live may also be any one of the possible multiply - connected quotient three - spaces @xmath13 , where @xmath14 stands for @xmath9 , @xmath10 or @xmath12 , and @xmath15 is a discrete group of isometries of the covering space @xmath14 acting freely on @xmath14  @xcite .    whether we live in a simply or multiply - connected , finite ( compact ) or infinite ( non - compact ) space , and what is the size and the shape of the universe are open problems modern cosmology seeks to solve  @xcite .",
    "the most immediate consequence of multiply - connectedness of the universe is that the sky may show multiple images of cosmic objects periodically distributed in the space .",
    "this periodic distribution of images arises from the correlations in their positions dictated by the discrete isometries of the covering group @xmath15 of the three - manifold used to model its space section .",
    "one way to tackle the problems regarding the topology of the universe is through a suitable statistical analysis applied to catalogs of discrete cosmic sources to find out whether or not there are multiple correlated images of cosmic objects , and eventually determine the topological features of the universe from the pattern of images the sky shows .",
    "the correlations among the images of cosmic objects in multiply - connected universes can be couched in terms of distance correlations between the images .",
    "indeed , one way of looking for distance correlations between cosmic images in multiply - connected universes is by using pair separations histograms ( psh ) , which are functions @xmath16 that count the number of pair of images separated by a distance that lies in intervals ( bins ) @xmath17 .",
    "the embryonic expectation was that the distance correlations would manifest as topological spikes in psh s , and that the spike spectrum would be a definite signature of the non - trivial topology  @xcite .",
    "however , this initial expectation turned out to be false  @xcite    @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the most striking evidence of multiply - connectedness in psh s is indeed the presence of such topological spikes , which arise from translational isometries @xmath18 .",
    "the non - translational isometries @xmath19 , however , manifest as rather tiny deformations of the expected pair separation histogram @xmath20 corresponding to the underlying simply - connected universe .",
    "however , from computer simulations it becomes clear that the expected pair separation histogram ( epsh ) corresponding to a multiply - connected universe @xmath21 , which is nothing but an psh from which the statistical noise has been withdrawn , is not a suitable quantity for revealing the topology of _ multiply - connected _",

    "note , however , that this quantity can not be used as distinguishing marks of _ simply - connected _ universes since it vanishes identically for such universes .",
    "this amounts to saying that the graphs of @xmath24 for all three classes of rw simply - connected universes which arise from ( simulated or real ) catalogs exhibit nothing but statistical noise , and thus @xmath24 should not be used as identifying markings in the simply - connected cases . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the scheme discussed in  @xcite as well as the approaches that make use of the cosmic microwave background radiation  @xcite  ",
    "@xcite were fundamentally devised to reveal the possible non - trivial topology of _ small _ universes . however ,",
    "neither the multiply nor the simply - connectedness for our universe has been discarded or confirmed by the current astrophysical observations .    in computer - aided simulations the histograms such as the psh s @xmath16 contain statistical fluctuations , which can give rise to sharp peaks of statistical ( non - topological ) origin , or can hide ( or mask ) the tiny deformations due to non - translational isometries .",
    "the most immediate approach to cope with fluctuation problems in psh s is by using the mean pair separation histogram ( mpsh ) scheme to obtain the mean psh @xmath25 rather than a single psh @xmath26 . in ref .",
    "@xcite they have used the mpsh technique to extract the topological signature of rw multiply - connected universes .",
    "this technique consists in the use of @xmath27 ( say ) computer - generated comparable catalogs to obtain the mean pair separation histograms @xmath28 and @xmath29 ; and use them as approximations for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , to construct the topological signature @xmath32\\,$ ] .",

    "in this section we will first set the notation and then recast in a unified and compact way the explicit expressions for the probability densities obtained in  @xcite so as to show that they can be used as distinguishing mark for the three possible classes ( @xmath4 ) of simply - connected rw universes fulfilled with an uniform distribution of cosmic objects .",
    "let us start by recalling that a _ catalog _",
    "@xmath40 is a set of _ observed images _ , subset of the set @xmath41 of _ observable _ images ( @xmath42 ) , which are clearly contained in the _ observable universe _ , which in turn is the part of the universal covering manifold @xmath14 causally connected to an image of a given observer .",
    "the _ observed universe _ is the part of the observable universe which contains all the sources registered in the catalog .",
    "our observational limitations are formulated through selection rules which dictate how the subset @xmath40 arises from @xmath41 .",
    "catalogs whose images obey the same ( well - behaved ) distribution law and that follow the same selection rules are said to be _ comparable catalogs _",
    "it should be noted that in the process of construction of catalogs it is assumed a rw geometry ( needed to convert redshift into distance ) and that a particular type of sources ( clusters of galaxies , quasars , etc ) is chosen from the outset .",
    "so , for our purpose in the present work , in addition to the angular positions on the celestial sphere , the relevant information registered in a given catalog is the redshift corresponding to each image in the catalog .",
    "consider a catalog @xmath40 with @xmath23 cosmic images and denote by @xmath43 the number of pairs of images whose separation is @xmath44 .",
    "consider also that our observed universe is a ball of radius @xmath37 and divide the interval @xmath45 $ ] in @xmath46 equal subintervals @xmath17 of length @xmath47 .",
    "each of such subintervals has the form @xmath48 \\qquad ; \\qquad i=1,2 , \\,\\ldots\\ , , m \\;\\ , , \\ ] ] and is centered at @xmath49 the psh is a normalized function which counts the number of pair of images separated by a distance that lies in the subinterval @xmath17 . thus the function psh is given by @xmath50 and is clearly subjected to the normalizing condition @xmath51    if one considers an ensemble of comparable catalogs . ] with the same number @xmath23 of images , and corresponding to the same three - manifold @xmath8 of constant curvature , one can compute probabilities and expected values of quantities which depend on the images in the catalogs of the ensemble . in particular , we can compute the expected number @xmath52 of pairs of cosmic images in a catalog @xmath40 of the ensemble with separations in @xmath17 .",
    "this quantity is quite relevant because from it one has the normalized expected pair separation histogram ( epsh ) which clearly is given by @xmath53 where obviously @xmath54 is the total number of pairs of cosmic images in @xmath40 , and @xmath55 is the probability that a pair of images be separated by a distance that lies in the interval @xmath17 .    in what follows",
    "we shall consider that we have an ensemble of comparable catalogs whose underlying observed universe ( spherical ball @xmath36 with radius @xmath37 ) are simply - connected and fulfilled with an uniform distribution of pointlike objects .",
    "we will take @xmath56 as distinguishing mark for these three classes of simply - connected universes .",
    "clearly for this uniform distribution of objects all separations @xmath57 are allowed , so the identifying markings @xmath38 are continuous functions of @xmath44 given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the probability that a pair of images in a catalog @xmath40 , corresponding to a simply - connected universe , be separated by a distance @xmath60 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "hereafter we will drop the subscript of @xmath59 .    to make explicit that the distinguishing mark depends upon the radius of the observed universe we rewrite  ( [ epshsc1 ] ) in the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 clearly is the probability density ,",
    "i.e. it is such that @xmath63 gives the probability that two arbitrary points in the ball @xmath36 be separated by a distance between @xmath44 and @xmath64 .",
    "equation  ( [ epshsc2 ] ) makes apparent that the @xmath65 gives essentially the distribution of probability for all @xmath44 in the ball @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , since the way one measures the distances varies for each constant curvature universe , it is clearly expected that the expression for distinguishing mark @xmath65 changes with the three - geometry of these simply - connected universes . in",
    "what follows we shall recast in a compact way the expressions of @xmath65 for euclidean , hyperbolic and elliptic simply - connected universes  @xcite .",
    "consider in either of the simply - connected three - spaces a ball @xmath66 centered at the origin @xmath67 , and let @xmath68 and @xmath69 be two arbitrary points in the ball .",
    "denote by @xmath70 $ ] the radial position of @xmath68 , and by @xmath71 the distance from @xmath68 to @xmath69 ( see figure  1 ) . of the universe",
    "@xmath72 is such that @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the radius of the curvature of the geometry , i.e. the scale factor of rw metric  ( [ rwmetric ] ) for a given time @xmath75 .",
    "further , for the sake of simplicity and without loss of generality we shall also set @xmath76 for both the hyperbolic and elliptic cases . ]",
    "consider now the quantity @xmath77 , which is the probability that @xmath68 lies in a position between @xmath78 and @xmath79 , times the probability that the separation between @xmath68 and @xmath69 lies between @xmath44 and @xmath64 .",
    "clearly for the simply - connected cases we are concerned the probability density @xmath80 is proportional to the following two areas : ( i ) @xmath81 which is the area of the locus of the points @xmath68 located at a distance @xmath78 from the origin @xmath82 ; and ( ii ) the area of the locus of the points @xmath69 that are separated from @xmath68 by @xmath44 .",
    "note , however , that when @xmath83 the latter locus is a two - sphere @xmath84 with area @xmath85 , whereas when @xmath86 it changes into a spherical calotte ( cap ) with area @xmath87 .    to sum up",
    "we have that the expression for the probability density @xmath80 for the configuration in which @xmath68 is between @xmath78 and @xmath88 , and is separated from @xmath69 by a distance between @xmath44 and @xmath64 , can be written in the general form @xmath89\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is a normalization constant and @xmath91 is the heaviside function",
    ". obviously , due to the cut - off effects of the function @xmath91 the first term of the sum in the right - hand side of  ( [ den ] ) is nonzero only for @xmath83 , whereas the second term is non - null only when @xmath92 .",
    "now since the area @xmath93 of the two - sphere as well as the area of the spherical calotte @xmath94 depend on what is the simply - connected three - space where the ball @xmath66 is considered , then to obtain @xmath80 for each class of simply - connected universes we are interested one ought to : ( i ) calculate the areas @xmath93 and @xmath94 ; ( ii ) insert in  ( [ den ] ) and integrate @xmath80 from @xmath95 to @xmath96 ; and ( iii ) impose the normalization condition @xmath97 to obtain the value of the normalization constant @xmath90 . in what follows",
    "we shall use this systematic scheme to determine @xmath80 for the three classes of simply - connected universes we are concerned .    for euclidean universe ( @xmath98 ) one",
    "obviously has @xmath99 , and straightforward calculations furnish @xmath100 $ ] . according to the above - outlined scheme inserting these expressions in  ( [ den ] ) , integrating @xmath80 from @xmath95 to @xmath96 , and using the condition  ( [ normcond ] ) together with  ( [ epshsc2 ] ) , one obtains that the expression for the distinguishing mark @xmath101 of a euclidean universe is given by @xmath102 which holds for @xmath103 $ ] , and where the value of the normalization constant was found to be @xmath104 .    before proceeding to the next class it",
    "should be noticed that the shape of the signature @xmath101 does not depend on the value of the radius @xmath37 .",
    "indeed , in terms of a new variable @xmath105 the expression  ( [ marke ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath106 which makes clear that for distinct radii @xmath37 one has different constant multiplying factors @xmath107 , but without changing the functional dependence of @xmath101 with @xmath44 .",
    "so , the shape of the graph of the distinguishing mark function for euclidean universes does not depend on the value of the radius @xmath37 .    for hyperbolic universes ( @xmath108 )",
    "one obtains @xmath109 and @xmath110 $ ] .",

    "it turns out that the general expression of the distinguishing mark which holds for all elliptic universes with @xmath125 $ ] and fulfilled with a uniform distribution of objects is given by @xmath126\\ ,                        \\left.\\right\\ } \\label{markel } \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath127\\,$ ] .    in what follows",
    "we shall present and analyze a few graphs of the distinguishing mark for each class or rw simply - connected universes .",
    "figure  2 shows the distinguishing mark @xmath101 for a euclidean universe @xmath36 with radius @xmath128 .",
    "this marking also gives the probability distribution of the pair separation distance @xmath44 for @xmath103 $ ] .",
    "a close inspection of this figure reveals that the most likely separation between two arbitrary pointlike objects in the euclidean observed universe @xmath36 is slightly greater than the radius @xmath37 of the ball .",
    "figure  3 shows the distinguishing mark @xmath129 for three values of the radius @xmath37 . for @xmath130",
    "this function behaves approximately as that we have derived for the euclidean universe ( figure  2 ) , as one would expect from the beginning . for increasing values of the radius @xmath37 of the observed universe the maximum of the mark @xmath129 moves towards the greater values of @xmath44 . in other words , the most likely value of @xmath44 increases ( the maximum of @xmath129 takes place later ) for increasing values of the radius @xmath131 .    in figure  4 four graphs of the distinguishing mark",
    "@xmath132 for different values of the radius @xmath37 of the universe are shown . for increasing values of @xmath37 from @xmath133 to @xmath134 the maximum of the signature @xmath132 moves continuously towards the smaller values of @xmath44 .",
    "contrarily to the hyperbolic case , here for increasing values of the radius @xmath37 the maximum of @xmath132 moves toward the origin ( smaller values of @xmath60 ) .",
    "this is also illustrated in figure  4 , where the most likely value of the separation @xmath44 decreases ( the maximum of @xmath132 takes place earlier ) for increasing values of @xmath131 .",
    "it also should be mentioned that for an arbitrary radius of curvature of the geometry @xmath74 the expressions for @xmath135 and @xmath136 can be obtained by multiplying the right - hand side of  ( [ markh ] ) and  ( [ markel ] ) by @xmath137 , and simultaneously by changing @xmath138 and @xmath139 .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we will discuss the improvement of the method to extract the topological signature @xmath140\\;,\\ ] ] of multiply - connected universes studied in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "to this end , the relevant point to be noted is that an epsh @xmath30 is essentially a typical psh from which the statistical noise has been withdrawn .",
    "hence we have @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 represent the statistical noises that arise in the corresponding psh s .",
    "using now the decompositions  ( [ noise1 ] ) and  ( [ noise2 ] ) together with  ( [ topsig ] ) one readily obtains @xmath144 \\;,\\ ] ] which clearly gives the topological signature intermixed with two statistical fluctuations .",
    "now , from equations  ( [ topsig ] )    ( [ topsigapx ] ) it is clear that one can approach the topological signature of multiply - connected universes @xmath145 by reducing the statistical fluctuations , i.e. by making @xmath146 as well as @xmath147 through any suitable statistical method to lower the noises .",
    "an improvement of the method devised in  @xcite to extract the topological signature @xmath24 of multiply - connected universes with a uniform distribution of matter comes out from the very fact that having the derived expressions  ( [ marke ] ) , ( [ markh ] ) and  ( [ markel ] ) one has from the beginning @xmath148 for those universes .",
    "thus , for example , if the mpsh is the technique one uses to reduce the statistical fluctuations , the topological signature  ( [ topsig ] ) in these cases reduces to the form @xmath149\\,$ ] , with the exact expression for @xmath20 rather than the approximate mean @xmath29 .",
    "to a certain extent it is well - known that rw geometry  ( [ rwmetric ] ) does not fix the global shape ( topology ) of the spacetime , and that there is an infinite number of topologically distinct @xmath7 spatial sections @xmath8 for the rw spacetime manifold . nevertheless , it is often ( implicitly or explicitly ) assumed that the @xmath7 spatial sections @xmath8 of a rw spacetime manifold are one of the following simply - connected spaces : @xmath9 ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , or @xmath12 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "however , this assumption of simply - connectedness for our three - space has not been settled by cosmological observations . as a matter of fact , neither the simply nor the multiply - connectedness for the three - space where we live has been discarded or confirmed by the available astrophysical data",
    ".    the two main approaches to constrain or determine the topology of the our three - space rely on the existence of multiple ( topological ) images of either cosmic objects or spots of microwave background radiation , and thus they aim at non - trivial topology of _ small _ universes  a possible simply - connectedness ( trivial topology ) of the universe has not been suitably considered in these approaches .",
    "a special method to determine possible non - trivial topologies of rw universes , and which relies on the existence of multiple images , was recently discussed in  @xcite .",
    "there it is suggested that the quantity @xmath150 $ ] is a suitable measure of the topological signature of the multiply - connected rw universes .",
    "however , @xmath151 can not be used as the topological signature for simply - connected universes , since it vanishes identically .",
    "this means that if we live in rw simply - connected universe the graphs of @xmath24 which arise from real ( or simulated ) catalogs will exhibit nothing but statistical noise .",
    "thus @xmath24 can be used not only to extract the topological signature of multiply - connected universes but also to decide between multiply or simply - connectedness of the universe , since in this latter case it gives rise simply to statistical noise .",
    "one might think at first sight that the vanishing of @xmath145 ( which means that it gives rise to nothing but statistical fluctuations ) would lead _ only _ to the simply - connectedness without separating among the three possible classes of simply - connected rw universes . in practice ,",
    "though , the vanishing of @xmath24 takes place for one underlying rw metric used to convert redshift into distance to have the pair separations , and thus it also gives the underlying manifold of the corresponding simply - connected universe , as there is a clear correspondence between geometry and the covering manifold in these cases .",
    "nevertheless , since @xmath145 vanishes identically ( gives rise to nothing but statistical noise ) for all classes of rw universes it is not an univocal ( or unequivocal ) distinguishing mark of these universes .",
    "thus we have been led to take the quantity @xmath65 as distinguishing mark of the simply - connected rw universes .",
    "clearly @xmath124 : ( i ) does not vanish ; ( ii ) can be used to separate the three possible classes of simply - connected rw universes ; and ( iii ) it is the quantity which really matters ( in this statistical context ) for the simply - connected cases . actually @xmath65 can also be used to distinguish rw universes with different radius @xmath37 .",
    "further , note that since the way one measures the distances varies for each constant curvature universe , it was really expected from the outset that the expression for the distinguishing mark @xmath65 would be distinct for different simply - connected universes .",
    "we have also presented the explicit expressions of the distinguishing marks @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 for , respectively , euclidean , hyperbolic and elliptic simply - connected rw universes fulfilled with an uniform distribution of cosmic objects . besides , we have presented and analyzed graphs of this signature for the simply - connected rw universes , and discussed the improvement that these exact expressions bring to the method to extract the topological signature of multiply - connected universes discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the distinguishing marks for the simply - connected rw universes @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 , which we have studied in is this work give , in each case , the probability distributions of the pair separation @xmath155 $ ] .",
    "if one takes these probability distributions as _ ground _ distributions , then the topological signature of multiply - connected rw universes @xmath24 studied in  @xcite can be understood as a measure of the deviation between the pair separation probability distribution in the multiply - connected cases [ given by @xmath156 and the corresponding ground pair separation probability distribution .",
    "the isometries @xmath157 of the covering group @xmath15 modify the ground pair separation probability distribution , and the quantity @xmath24 measures that deviation of topological origin .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in the cases of multiply - connected universes for which the smaller length of the fundamental polyhedron @xmath158 of @xmath8 ( @xmath159 ) is greater than the diameter @xmath160 ( @xmath161 is the particle horizon ) of the observed universe @xmath162 , no multiple images can be observed .",
    "these multiply - connected universes are therefore indistinguishable from the simply - connected universes with the same covering space , equal radius , and identical distribution of cosmic sources . in these multiply - connected cases in which the scale of the multiply - connectedness is greater than the radius @xmath161 universe",
    "@xmath163 no sign of the multiply - connectedness will arise , and the distinguishing marks we have discussed in this work can play a relevant role , when there is a homogeneous distribution of matter , of course .    to close this article",
    "it is worth mentioning that the ultimate goal in the statistical approaches to extract the topological signature ( mark ) is the comparison of the graphs ( signature or mark ) obtained either theoretically or from simulated catalogs against similar graphs obtained from real catalogs .",
    "to do so , one clearly has to have either the exact explicit expression or the simulated patterns of the topological signatures of the possible universes .",
    "the expressions we have found for the distinguishing mark of simply - connected rw universes with a uniform distribution of matter can certainly be used in such comparisons .",
