    "it is well - known that loop effects in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) can become large when the ratio @xmath6 of the two higgs vacuum expectation values is sizeable .",
    "an important example is the higgs coupling to bottom quarks , @xmath7  @xcite . in the limit of heavy superpartner particle masses ,",
    "the relevant couplings are @xcite @xmath8 this includes a coupling @xmath9 to the `` wrong '' higgs doublet , which is forbidden by supersymmetry at tree level .",
    "the quantity @xmath9 is an ordinary one - loop effect and not enhanced in any way .",
    "however , due to the large ratio of vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) the bottom quark mass @xmath10 receives large @xmath0-enhanced corrections to its tree - level value @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "so does the @xmath7 coupling , when @xmath12 is eliminated in favour of @xmath13 as is usually done .",
    "in general , while the loop effect is not large by itself , it provides large corrections to couplings or observables , which are suppressed by the small vacuum expectation value @xmath14 or which vanish at tree level .",
    "this type of relative enhancement is clearly a one - loop effect , which does not repeat itself in higher loop orders .",
    "here we investigate other effects of this type from the higgs sector , where loop effects can lead to a mixing of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 fields through two- and four - point interactions , which indirectly modify the yukawa couplings to the physical higgs bosons .",
    "we also address the issue of renormalization conventions for @xmath0 and their stability against radiative corrections , as investigated in a numerical approach in @xcite .",
    "the indirect effects from the higgs sector have not been considered explicitly in the literature , although our results are implicit in one - loop calculations of mssm higgs decay rates  @xcite . however , these calculations are usually available only in numerical form . having simple analytic expressions at hand is often useful to acquire a better understanding of parameter dependences , especially for the mssm with its large parameter space .",
    "higgs - sector effects from two - point interactions have been considered recently in  @xcite , while their consequences for @xmath17 mixing are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical issues can be exposed most clearly in the decoupling limit , assuming that all superpartner particles are heavy , of order @xmath18 , while the standard model ( sm ) particles together with all five physical higgs bosons are light , at most @xmath19 , the electroweak scale . in practice",
    ", the decoupling limit may be a good approximation for @xmath18 as small as a few hundred gev .",
    "the assumed hierarchy implies a certain amount of fine - tuning , since the soft susy breaking parameters and the @xmath20 parameter must be @xmath21 , while @xmath22 are @xmath19 to make the higgs bosons light .",
    "the higgs - mixing parameter @xmath23 must even be much smaller than @xmath24 to achieve large @xmath25 .",
    "the first fine - tuning is the well - known `` little hierarchy problem '' , here built in by hand by the assumption @xmath26 , but the second is an extra fine - tuning of @xmath23 specific to the large-@xmath0 scenario , which has received less attention up to now . to simplify the discussion we consider only the third family of fermions and",
    "assume cp conservation in the mssm .",
    "including the ckm matrix and cp - violating mssm phases would be straightforward . under these assumptions",
    "we match the mssm to an effective general two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , and determine the physical higgs fields , the yukawa couplings , and trilinear higgs couplings from the one - loop corrected effective 2hdm .",
    "the higgs and yukawa terms of the mssm lagrangian are given by @xmath27 the conventions are as follows : the antisymmetric @xmath28 matrix @xmath29 is defined with @xmath30 .",
    "the hypercharge u(1)@xmath31 and su(2 ) couplings are @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the quark fields are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , the leptons @xmath37 , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 denotes a weyl spinor index . for the higgs doublets we also use the notation @xmath40 , @xmath41 , such that @xmath42 and @xmath43 both have hypercharge @xmath44 .",

    "the relevant parameters of the mssm higgs sector are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath50 , @xmath23 , @xmath51 and the two vevs @xmath52 .",
    "it appears to be contrary to the spirit of interpreting the mssm as the high - scale theory and the 2hdm as the low - energy effective theory to introduce the vevs as mssm parameters , since the vevs should be found _ a posteriori _ by minimizing the 2hdm effective potential .",
    "however , since we wish to use standard mssm renormalization conventions , and moreover introduce @xmath0 as one of the mssm parameters , we substitute @xmath53 in the lagrangian ( [ mssm ] ) . in this way , after further fixing the renormalization convention , the parameter @xmath6 is well - defined , contrary to the general 2hdm , where @xmath0 is unphysical , since it can assume any value by performing a rotation in the @xmath54 fields . in the mssm such rotations are excluded by holomorphy of the superpotential .",
    "an equivalent set of parameters consists of @xmath55 related to the previous set by @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "the quark masses are given by @xmath58 at tree level .",
    "for vanishing tadpole couplings @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the mass of the cp - odd neutral higgs boson .",
    "the parameters so far are bare parameters .",
    "we introduce renormalized parameters by substituting @xmath61 , where now @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) is the bare ( renormalized ) parameter and @xmath64 the corresponding counterterm .",
    "the renormalization conventions are specified by imposing conditions on the parameters of the second set : @xmath65 are defined by the conventional on - shell renormalization conditions for the electric charge and the particle pole masses , the tadpole couplings @xmath59 by the condition that the tadpoles ( one - point functions ) vanish .",
    "the renormalization condition for @xmath0 and the yukawa couplings , and the definition of @xmath66 beyond tree level will be discussed later .",
    "the counterterms @xmath64 for the parameters of the first set are then defined by requiring that ( [ parameterrel ] ) holds for the bare as well as the renormalized parameters .",
    "specifically , for @xmath0 this implies @xmath67_0 =   \\frac{[v_u]_0}{[v_d]_0 }   = \\frac{v_u+\\delta v_u}{v_d+\\delta v_d }   = \\frac{v_u}{v_d } +   \\frac{v_u}{v_d } \\left(\\frac{\\delta v_u}{v_u } - \\frac{\\delta v_d}{v_d}\\right ) + \\ldots.\\ ] ] employing @xmath6 , the one - loop relation @xmath68 follows .",
    "similarly , one obtains a set of equations relating the shifts of all parameters of the second set to those of the first .    we do not need to discuss the renormalization of superpartner masses and the @xmath49 and @xmath20 terms , since these occur only in loops . in a one - loop calculation , it is sufficient to know these parameters at tree - level .",
    "other sm parameters like the strong coupling or ckm matrix play no role here .",
    "for the subsequent discussion of @xmath0-enhanced terms field renormalization in the mssm can also be ignored .",
    "thus , we shall not introduce renormalization factors @xmath69 for the su(2)-doublet fields .",
    "the divergent parts of the vev counterterms @xmath70 are identical to those in @xmath69 , since the theory in the broken phase can be rendered finite by the same counterterms as the unbroken theory before the shift ( [ introducevevs ] ) .",
    "thus , when we ignore field renormalization , we should formally consider @xmath70 and consequently @xmath71 as finite quantities , which indeed they are in the large-@xmath25 approximation , whose values are nevertheless fixed by the imposed renormalization conventions .",
    "we integrate out the heavy susy particles and expand the mssm effective action in local operators .",
    "the result is a general 2hdm , where the higgs - yukawa terms read @xmath72   \\label{twohdm}\\\\ & & + y_b \\phi_1\\epsilon q b + y_t \\phi_2^\\dagger q t   + y_\\tau \\phi_1\\epsilon",

    "the last line equals @xmath73 in terms of the @xmath74 fields , so the yukawa couplings take their standard form . since we assumed cp conservation in the mssm , the matrices @xmath75 , @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) and the couplings @xmath78 are real .",
    "note that the kinetic terms of the higgs fields are not yet canonical , because we match 1pi green functions .",
    "the kinetic terms of the fermions can be disregarded , since their renormalization is an ordinary one - loop correction to an unsuppressed tree term . at tree - level @xmath79 in the following the one - loop corrections to the couplings that vanish or are small at tree - level",

    "all matching calculations are performed in the su(2)@xmath85u(1)@xmath86 symmetric `` phase '' of the mssm .",

    "the kinetic - mixing correction @xmath84 is finite , as it should be , while the correction to @xmath87 is ultraviolet divergent and requires regularization ( here dimensional regularization , space - time dimension @xmath95 and renormalization scale @xmath96 ) .",
    "the @xmath97 pole is cancelled by the counterterm contribution @xmath98_{\\rm heavy}$ ] to @xmath87 .",
    "the counterterm contribution is the difference between the mssm and the 2hdm counterterm , which survives the matching relation , and cancels the singularity in the heavy - particle loops . in the following",
    "we shall drop the label `` heavy '' in the counterterm contributions .",
    "we remark that we have kept complex conjugation on the @xmath20 and @xmath49 parameters , where required , if they were complex .",

    "i.e. _ schemes satisfying @xmath284 in the large-@xmath0 limit , in which case the two relevant corrections from ( [ eq : yukawa ] ) are @xmath285 in terms of the quantities @xmath286 , the one - loop improved couplings of the higgs fields to the bottom and top quark are rewritten as , omitting the global factors outside the curly brackets in eq .",
    "( [ eq : yukawa ] ) , @xmath287 the function @xmath288 , which appears in the one - loop corrections to the small tree - level trilinear higgs couplings ( [ eq : tri ] ) , also has a simple expression in terms of @xmath289 , given by @xmath290    we perform a random parameter sampling for the susy parameters in the following ranges : 500 gev@xmath291tev , with @xmath292 being the squark , slepton or gaugino masses , and 500 gevlatexmath:[$\\,\\le |\\mu| , | \\widetilde{a}_t| , | \\widetilde{a}_b| ,     the parameters @xmath20 , @xmath276 and @xmath277 are explored separately , but we fix @xmath294 .",
    "since the @xmath60 dependence of @xmath289 comes in only through the prefactor @xmath295 , we shall fix it to the reference value @xmath296gev . here",
    "contrary to the analytic expressions in the previous subsection , we correctly include the @xmath0-enhanced loop correction to the down - type quark and lepton yukawa couplings , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath297 is used .",
    "we remark that not all points allowed in the parameter scan are physical , since vacuum stability requirements do not allow large @xmath49 terms relative to the scale of the susy particle masses .     and @xmath298 versus @xmath232 and @xmath237 respectively , for @xmath296gev and positive @xmath20 .",
    "the plots in the first row have @xmath299 and those in the second row have @xmath300 ( @xmath301 in all plots ) . ]",
    "let us first study the case of positive @xmath20 , where @xmath237 is preferentially positive , so that @xmath12 is reduced by the one - loop correction . in figure  [ fig5 ]",
    "we show @xmath302 ( left ) and @xmath298 ( right ) versus @xmath232 and @xmath237 , respectively , for both signs of @xmath303 ( positive in the upper plots , negative in the lower ones ) . for positive @xmath20 , the value of @xmath0 does not significantly change the shape of the scatter plot , and",
    "hence has been fixed to @xmath304 .",
    "the typical size of the effective couplings is a few percent .",
    "values of @xmath305 range up to 0.1 , which implies that the one - loop induced coupling may exceed the @xmath0-suppressed tree coupling for values of @xmath0 as small as 10 . in comparison",
    ", @xmath302 , which originates only from kinetic mixing , tends to be significantly smaller .",
    "thus , the higgs sector correction @xmath298 competes in size with the `` wrong - higgs '' yukawa coupling @xmath237 even for large values of @xmath60 , and is in fact the dominant one - loop correction to the @xmath306 yukawa interaction .",
    "some general features that can be observed in figure  [ fig5 ] , or extracted from the analytic expressions are :    * in the assumed range of susy parameters , the sign of @xmath237 ( @xmath232 ) is correlated ( anti - correlated ) with the sign of @xmath20 , since the gluino contribution ( first term in ( [ eq : deltayb ] ) ) dominates and the function @xmath307 is always negative . the term proportional to @xmath276 can overcome the gluino contribution and change the sign of @xmath237 only for negative @xmath276 in the parameter - space region where @xmath308 is much larger than @xmath309 .",
    "similarly , large negative @xmath277 can make @xmath232 positive , when @xmath310 . *",
    "since @xmath237 can not reach large negative values , there is no significant enhancement of the bottom yukawa coupling from the large-@xmath0 resummation .",
    "the numerical effect of the terms proportional to @xmath311 is therefore small compared to those proportional to @xmath312 .",
    "we verified that the scatter plots for negative @xmath277 are similar to the ones with positive @xmath277 shown in figure  [ fig5 ] . * larger values of @xmath313 ( @xmath314 )",
    "tend to be correlated with larger values of @xmath315 ( @xmath305 ) .",
    "however , there is no strict relation , since the dominant contribution to the `` wrong - higgs '' yukawa couplings is proportional to the gluino mass , while those to the higgs - sector couplings involve the @xmath49 terms . * the largest contribution to @xmath302 is given by the term proportional to @xmath276 in  ( [ z121loop ] ) .",
    "however , the sign of @xmath302 is not determined uniquely by the sign of @xmath276 due to the gaugino term proportional to @xmath316 , which is always positive ( the function @xmath317 is positive ) and can become comparable to the @xmath276 term in some regions of the parameter space . * in most of the explored parameter space",
    "the sign of @xmath298 is opposite to the sign of @xmath276 .",
    "since the @xmath229 term in the definition ( [ eq : h1h2 ] ) of @xmath298 is the larger of the two , we have @xmath318 .",
    "the relation @xmath319 can be understood as follows : neglecting the smaller terms involving gauge couplings , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda7 ] ) for @xmath229 contains the terms @xmath320 proportional to powers of @xmath276 .",
    "the first term has the same sign as @xmath276 , since @xmath321 is always negative , while the second term has opposite sign , since @xmath322 is positive . defining the ratio @xmath323 with @xmath324",
    ", we find that @xmath325 is monotonically increasing , satisfying @xmath326 when @xmath327 as allowed by our parameter - space sampling . the third term in ( [ eq : at ] )",
    "can compete with the first only if @xmath328 .",
    "for @xmath329 this relation requires large @xmath49 terms , @xmath330 , which are disfavoured by vacuum stability arguments .",
    "we also note that the largest gaugino term in @xmath229 ( the one proportional to @xmath331 ) gives a positive contribution because the function @xmath332 is negative .     versus @xmath237 , for @xmath296gev and negative @xmath20 .",
    "the plots in the first row correspond to @xmath333 and @xmath334 , while those in the second row have @xmath335 .",
    "black , lightgray and darkgray points ( blue , yellow and red in colored plots ) correspond to @xmath336 and @xmath337 , respectively . ]",
    "let us now turn to the case @xmath338 .",
    "the most important difference is that the negative sign of the @xmath20 parameter flips the sign of @xmath237 to negative values ( and the one of @xmath232 to positive values ) , which leads to a strong increase of the bottom and @xmath216 yukawa coupling , when @xmath237 cancels the @xmath124 term in ( [ mb ] ) .",
    "the validity of a perturbative expansion is in doubt when the yukawa couplings become too large . in the parameter space sampling for negative @xmath20",
    ", we therefore only keep points that satisfy @xmath339 .",
    "the dependence of the higgs sector correction @xmath298 versus @xmath237 , for three representative values of @xmath340 , @xmath296gev , and all other susy parameters scanned randomly in the above intervals is shown figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "the perturbativity cut on @xmath12 has a strong effect , since it eliminates points with large negative values @xmath237 given a value of @xmath0 .",
    "the value of @xmath237 at which this happens can be estimated by @xmath341 , which gives @xmath342 for @xmath340 , respectively , in agreement with the figures . at these points",
    "we observe a rapid increase of @xmath305 driven by the term @xmath343 in ( [ eq : lambda7 ] ) , which gives a contribution to @xmath344 with sign opposite to @xmath277 .",
    "point i/ discussed above also applies to the case of negative @xmath20 taking into the account the reversed signs of @xmath244 .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig7 ] shows the the higgs correction @xmath302 versus @xmath232 for @xmath340 .",
    "compared to the case of positive @xmath20 , the sign of @xmath277 has now a relevant effect , especially for larger values of @xmath0 , due to the contribution of the @xmath277 term in @xmath84 .",
    "however , the growth with @xmath12 is less pronounced than in case of @xmath298 , since @xmath302 does not contain terms proportional to @xmath345 .     versus @xmath232 , for @xmath296gev and negative @xmath20 .",
    "plots in the first row have @xmath346 and @xmath334 , and @xmath347 in the second row .",
    "black , lightgray and darkgray points ( blue , yellow and red in colored plots ) correspond to @xmath336 and @xmath337 , respectively . ]",
    "this paper has been motivated by previous work @xcite that systematically investigated the resummation of susy qcd large-@xmath0 effects in the decoupling limit , where the standard model particles and higgs scalars remain light , but which did not consider electroweak effects .",
    "we performed a complete one - loop matching of the mssm to a two - higgs doublet model for all couplings that are absent or suppressed in the mssm with large @xmath0 , keeping all contributions that are @xmath0-enhanced relative to the suppressed tree terms .",
    "this includes complete expressions for the kinetic mixing and higgs self couplings @xmath246 , which have not been given previously .",
    "our result confirms , as expected , that a resummation of large-@xmath0 effects to arbitrary loop order is necessary only for the bottom and tau yukawa couplings , if the bottom and tau mass are used as parameters of the mssm .",
    "it clarifies a point left open in @xcite , namely how the renormalization of @xmath0 affects this resummation .",
    "we find that the standard expression for the resummed yukawa coupling is valid in renormalization schemes where the counterterms ( shifts ) of @xmath0 and the vacuum expectation value @xmath14 do not receive large-@xmath0 contributions .",
    "in other schemes , a finite counterterm must be explicitly included in the resummation formula .",
    "besides the known `` wrong - higgs '' yukawa couplings , all other higgs - sector effects that feed into the yukawa couplings by modifying the definition of the physical higgs fields at one loop can be parameterized in terms of two couplings @xmath302 , @xmath298 dominated by kinetic mixing and the higgs self - coupling @xmath229 , respectively .",
    "the same @xmath298 also enters the effective trilinear higgs couplings .",
    "our numerical study suggests that , where present , the higgs - sector effect @xmath298 is more important than the `` wrong - higgs '' yukawa couplings , and we identified the dominant susy parameter dependences .",
    "our result extends and corrects a previous result @xcite that included the kinetic - mixing effect , but not the one from the one - loop induced higgs couplings .",
    "although obtained in the decoupling limit , the effective one - loop couplings derived in this paper should be useful to obtain simple analytic estimates of the leading quantum corrections to those yukawa and higgs trilinear interactions , that are suppressed at tree - level , such as the @xmath348 coupling .",
