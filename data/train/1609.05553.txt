    "light beams showing an inhomogeneous polarization distribution , commonly referred to as vector beams ( vbs ) , represent a precious resource in an increasing number of photonic applications @xcite : astronomy @xcite , microscopy @xcite , optomechanics @xcite , materials structuring @xcite , nanophotonics @xcite and quantum sciences @xcite are some remarkable examples . uniformly polarized beams can be easily converted into such spatially structured fields by coupling the vectorial and the spatial degrees of freedom of light @xcite , as recently demonstrated in a variety of photonic architectures @xcite .",
    "the fine structure of vbs polarization may show several typologies of singular points @xcite , in close analogy to other inhomogeneous systems ( fingerprint , tidal heights across the oceans , etc . ) .",
    "here we consider those spatial regions where there is no preferred direction for the oscillations of the electric field @xcite , with the most relevant case being represented by the so called @xmath0-points , that is points where the polarization is circular .",
    "their formation and dynamical evolution has been investigated in the complex polarization pattern characterizing several structured fields , such as for instance speckle fields @xcite , random superposition of vector waves @xcite , light passing through inhomogeneous anisotropic media @xcite , photonic crystals @xcite .",
    "independently of the specific system , the electric field around a polarization singularity is oriented according to the value of the associated topological charge @xmath1 ; this is an integer or semi - integer number , defined as the angle described by the major axis of the local polarization ellipse ( divided by 2@xmath2 ) when following a closed path around the @xmath0-point . besides its connection with the surrounding polarization distribution @xcite",
    ", the value of this charge is particularly important in determining the singularity robustness , since only the lowest order c - points with @xmath3 are stable with respect to small deformations of the optical system @xcite .",
    "this is analogous to the case of high - order optical vortices in scalar field , which have been observed to split into elementary vortices as soon as a tiny perturbation is introduced @xcite .",
    "the instability of higher - order polarization singularities , with the role of @xmath0-points played by points of unpolarized light , can be beautifully observed in the skylight polarization pattern ; here the original two singular points ( @xmath4 ) , positioned at the sun and the anti - sun , split into four ( @xmath5 ) because of the contribution from multiple rayleigh scattering of sunlight in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "+ inspired by these phenomena , here we investigate the formation of lowest order @xmath0-points at the center of vector vortex beams ( vvbs ) @xcite .",
    "the latter are a particular class of vbs ( radially and azimuthally polarized beams are remarkable examples ) where a polarization singularity and an optical vortex ( phase singularity ) are superimposed at the center of the beam .",
    "this happens because the spatial mode associated with each of the two opposite circular polarizations is that of a light helical mode .",
    "these peculiar optical spatial modes , described in terms of an integer number @xmath6 , show a helical wavefront and carry a definite amount of orbital angular momentum ( oam ) @xcite , equal to @xmath7 per photons .",
    "the field amplitude vanishes at the center of these beams , and an optical vortex with topological charge @xmath6 appears as the field phase is not defined along the optical axis .",
    "since left and right circular components are both helical modes , in vvbs the total field is vanishing along the beam axis and its orientation is undefined .",
    "this peculiar polarization singularity is typically referred to as @xmath8-point @xcite ; differently from the case of a @xmath0-point , here the instantaneous oscillation direction of the electric field is undefined ( at any time ) .",
    "the lowest topological charge admitted for @xmath8-points is @xmath9 , since these are singularities of a field of vectors ( the instantaneous electric field ) , while @xmath0-points refer to a field of ellipses ( the trajectory described by the vector in a temporal cycle ) .",
    "here we show that a small perturbation changes the nature of the vector field characterizing pure vvbs , whose local polarization states acquire a tiny ellipticity . as in such a field",
    "maxwell s equations allows for polarization singularities with a lower charge ( c - points ) , even the lowest order v - point becomes unstable and unfolds into a pair of equally charged c - points @xcite .",
    "we investigate experimentally this mechanism by perturbing a radial and azimuthal vvb ( @xmath4 ) with a uniformly polarized beam , and complete the analysis with an example of higher order vvb ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this kind of perturbation acts as a coherent background , whose role has been investigated in the decay of optical vortices at the center of beams carrying oam @xcite . recently a similar study of @xmath8-point unfolding was proposed theoretically in ref .",
    "@xcite , although the analysis is focused on @xmath8-point and @xmath0-point dynamics during the beam propagation , rather than the instability of @xmath8-points . by controlling the amplitude of the two fields , we report the progressive formation of c - points ( that originate from the central v - point ) , whose separation increases as the gaussian term gets higher .",
    "importantly , the polarization pattern modification is always accompanied by a deformation of the original intensity pattern .",
    "interesting features arise when increasing the intensity of the perturbing term , in particular when this becomes equal or higher than the original vvb and the polarization pattern may lose its non - trivial topological features ( at least in the region where almost all the field energy is enclosed ) .",
    "a vvb corresponds to the superposition of two ( or more ) different helical modes of light associated with orthogonal circular polarizations . denoting as",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 states of left and right circular polarizations , respectively , a vvb can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 are complex coefficients and the complex amplitude @xmath16 describes the field associated with a helical mode of order @xmath6 , expressed in terms of the cylindrical coordinates @xmath17 with the @xmath18 axis corresponding to the optical axis of the beam .",
    "while the phase factor @xmath19 give rise to the typical helical wavefront , the function @xmath20 describes the radial distribution of the field .",
    "here we have considered the simple case of two helical modes with opposite @xmath6 ; similar results hold for all other vvbs . except the case @xmath21 , helical modes vanish along the optical axis ( @xmath22 ) where they show an optical vortex with charge @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "accordingly , in the case of an ideal vvb , a v - point with charge @xmath23 is present at the center of the beam , at any plane transverse to the propagation direction . in order to show a possible mechanism that leads to the @xmath8-point transformation into lowest order singularities ,",
    "let us consider the specific case @xmath24 and @xmath25 , corresponding to a radially polarized beam . at a fixed transverse plane and very close to the beam center , that is at @xmath26 much smaller than the typical beam dimensions , eq .",
    "[ eq : vvb ] has a simpler expression : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a real constant defining the field intensity .",
    "we add to eq .",
    "[ eq : vvb_smallr ] a linearly polarized term with uniform amplitude @xmath29 ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 are real constants ) , whose electric field is oriented at an angle @xmath32 with respect to the horizontal direction . in the representation of circular polarizations , this perturbation can be written as @xmath33 ; when added to the original vvb , eq .",
    "[ eq : vvb_smallr ] becomes @xmath34 left and right @xmath0-points are located at positions @xmath35 and @xmath36 where the right and left circular components of the field are vanishing , respectively .",
    "it is straightforward to see that @xmath37 in general @xmath38 and two @xmath0-points with opposite handedness but with equal charge @xmath5 generate from the original v - point . using the same approach it is possible to show that v - points of order @xmath6 unfold into @xmath39 @xmath0-points , with the sign of their charge being equal to that of the original singularity .",
    "the results we discussed in the previous section can be easily simulated experimentally by exploiting the same approach reported in @xcite for the generation of pure vvbs .",
    "the preparation and the controlled alteration of a vvb is obtained by exploiting tunable spin - orbit interaction of a light beam in a @xmath40-plate @xcite .",
    "this an optical element made of a thin layer of liquid crystals , whose optic axes are arranged so as to form a singular inhomogeneous pattern .",
    "besides the topological charge @xmath40 , defining the rotation of the local liquid crystal axis around the singular point ( divided by @xmath41 ) , the action of this device is determined by its optical retardation @xmath42 .",
    "the value of the latter can be suitably adjusted by applying an external electric field , which allows for controlling the strength of the spin - orbit interaction mediated by the plate @xcite . when passing through a @xmath40-plate placed at the beam waist ( this is the standard configuration that we adopt throughout the manuscript ) , a tem@xmath43 gaussian beam with uniform left or right circular polarization is transformed as follows @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the angle of the liquid crystals optic axis at @xmath46 .",
    "the previous equation shows that left and right circular polarizations are partially converted into helical modes of order @xmath47 , respectively , with the amount of converted light depending on the value of @xmath42 ( @xmath48 corresponds to a full conversion ) .",
    "helical modes generated by a @xmath40-plate are described by the so - called hypergeometric - gaussian modes ( hygg@xmath49 ) @xcite , corresponding to a specific class of light beams carrying oam @xcite , analogously to laguerre - gauss or bessel beams .",
    "two indices @xmath50 specify the mode properties , where @xmath6 is associated with the oam content while @xmath51 determines the radial distribution of the field .",
    "[ eq : qplate_action ] clearly shows that , if @xmath48 , a linearly polarized gaussian beam is fully converted into a vvb , showing a @xmath8-point with charge @xmath52 at its center .",
    "in particular , azimuthally and radially polarized beams are obtained when the input polarization is vertical @xmath53 and horizontal @xmath54 , respectively , the plate charge is @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( see fig .  [",

    "on the other hand , we can note that as we approach the near field , striking differences manifest when the @xmath40-plate retardation is higher or lower than @xmath106 . in the latter case singularities move away at infinite distances , while in the former case @xmath107 and @xmath108",

    "<S> optical singularities manifesting at the center of vector vortex beams are unstable , since their topological charge is higher than the lowest value permitted by maxwell s equations . inspired by conceptually similar phenomena occurring in the polarization pattern characterizing the skylight , we show how perturbations that break the symmetry of radially symmetric vector beams lead to the formation of a pair of fundamental and stable singularities , i.e. points of circular polarization . </S>",
    "<S> we prepare a superposition of a radial ( or azimuthal ) vector beam and a uniformly linearly polarized gaussian beam ; by varying the amplitudes of the two fields , we control the formation of pairs of these singular points and their spatial separation . </S>",
    "<S> we complete this study by applying the same analysis to vector vortex beams with higher topological charges , and by investigating the features that arise when increasing the intensity of the gaussian term . </S>",
    "<S> our results can find application in the context of singularimetry , where weak fields are measured by considering them as perturbation of unstable optical beams . </S>"
