    "the present paper is the first part of a series , in which we investigate the aspect of majorization in de  branges spaces .",

    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "all these considerations , as well as our previous work @xcite , deal with majorization along the real line .",
    "having these concepts in mind , a general notion of majorization in de  branges spaces evolves :    a1 let @xmath6 be a de  branges space , and let @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "set @xmath9 and define @xmath10    it turns out that , provided @xmath11 and @xmath12 satisfies a mild regularity condition , the space @xmath13 is a de  branges subspace of @xmath6 , i.e.  is itself a de  branges space when endowed with the inner product inherited from @xmath6 .",
    "the following questions related to this concept come up naturally .",
    "+ * _ which de  branges subspaces @xmath14 of a given de  branges space @xmath6 can be realized as @xmath15 with some majorant @xmath12 ? _     + * _ if @xmath14 is of the form @xmath13 with some @xmath12 , how big or how small can @xmath12 be chosen such that still @xmath15 ? _ + let us point out the two aspects of the second question . if @xmath15 , we have available a dense linear subspace of @xmath14 which consists of functions with limited growth on the domain @xmath0 of @xmath12 , namely @xmath16 .",
    "this knowledge becomes stronger , the smaller @xmath12 is . on the other hand",
    ", the equality @xmath15 also says that an element of @xmath6 already belongs to @xmath14 if it is majorized by @xmath12 .",
    "this knowledge becomes stronger , the bigger @xmath12 is .",
    "answers to these questions will , of course , depend on the set @xmath0 where majorization is permitted .",
    "up to now , only majorization along @xmath17 has been considered . for this case",

    "the `` how small''part of the second question is related to the deep investigations in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in this paper we give some answers to the first question , and to the `` how big''part of the second question . as domains @xmath0 of majorization we consider , among others , rays contained in the closed upper half - plane , lines parallel to the real axis contained in the closed upper half - plane , or combinations of such types of sets .",
    "for example , it turns out that each de  branges subspace @xmath14 of any given de  branges space @xmath6 can be realized as @xmath13 , when majorization is allowed on @xmath18 .",
    "even more , one can choose for @xmath12 a majorant which is naturally associated to @xmath14 , does not depend on the external space @xmath6 , is quite big , and actually gives @xmath19 .",
    "it is an interesting and , on first sight , maybe surprising consequence of de  branges theory , that the main strength of majorization is contributed by boundedness along the imaginary half - line , and not along @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , if we permit majorization only on some ray @xmath20 where @xmath21 , then all de  branges subspaces subject to an obvious necessary condition can be realized in the way stated above .",
    "similar phenomena , where growth restrictions on the imaginary half - axis imply a certain behaviour along the real line , have already been experienced in the classical theory , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 26 ) .",
    "let us close this introduction with an outline of the organization of this paper . in order to make the presentation as self - contained as possible , we start in section 2 with recalling some basic definitions and collecting some results which are essential for what follows , among them , the definition of de  branges spaces of entire functions , their relation to entire functions of hermite  biehler class , and the structure of de  branges subspaces . in section 3 , we make precise",
    "under which conditions on @xmath12 the space @xmath13 becomes a de  branges subspace of @xmath6 , and discuss some examples of majorants .",
    "sections 4 and 5 contain the main results of this paper .",
    "first we deal with representation of de  branges subspaces by majorization along rays not parallel to the real axis",
    ". then we turn to spaces @xmath13 obtained when majorization is required on a set close to the real axis , for example a line parallel to @xmath17 .",
    "the paper closes with two appendices . in the first appendix",
    "we prove an auxiliary result on model subspaces generated by inner functions , which is employed in section 5 .",
    "we decided to move this theorem out of the main text , since it is interesting on its own right and independent of the presentation concerning de  branges spaces . in the second appendix",
