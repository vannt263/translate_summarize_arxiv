    "images of about a steradian ( @xmath1 ) of the southern sky , at 151.5  mhz , using mrt  @xcite , were produced by  @xcite .",
    "the deconvolved images , with an angular resolution of @xmath2 and rms noise of about 300  mjy  beam@xmath3 , and a source catalogue of 2782 sources were published by  @xcite .",
    "systematics in positional errors were found when the positions of sources common to mrt and mrc @xcite catalogues were compared .",
    "the positional errors in right ascension ( ra ) show no systematics as a function of ra and the errors are within 15% of the ra beamwidth .",
    "the positional errors in declination ( dec ) also show no systematics as a function of ra .",
    "however , errors in dec show a linear gradient as a function of dec ( figure  [ f : sourcecomparison](a ) ) and reach about 50% of the mrt beamwidth in declination .",
    "histogram in figure  [ f : sourcecomparison](b ) shows the distribution of errors in dec . due to space limitations similar plots for ra errors are not shown .",
    "@xcite used one - dimensional ( 1-d ) robust least squares fit , estimated the errors and corrected them in the source catalog .",
    "however , the errors remained in the images , which impede usefulness of mrt images for multi - wavelength analysis of sources .",
    "this paper describes the application of two - dimensional ( 2-d ) homography , a technique ubiquitous in the computer vision and graphics community , to correct the errors in the image domain . at mrt",
    ", the visibility data is processed through several complex stages of data reduction specific to the array , especially , arising due to its non - coplanarity  @xcite .",
    "it was therefore decided to correct for the errors in the image domain and avoid re - processing the visibility data .",
    "homography is used to estimate a transformation matrix ( which includes rotation , translation and non - isotropic scaling ) that accounts for positional errors in the linearly gridded 2-d images .",
    "[ f : sourcecomparison ]",
    "2-d planar homography is a non - singular linear relationship between points on planes . given two sets of corresponding image points in projective coordinates , @xmath4 , homography maps each @xmath5 to the corresponding @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the homography sought is a non - singular @xmath7 matrix @xmath8 such that : @xmath9= \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } h_{11}&h_{12}&h_{13}\\\\ h_{21}&h_{22}&h_{23}\\\\ h_{31}&h_{32}&h_{33 } \\end{array}\\right ] \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } x\\\\y\\\\1\\end{array}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : inhomog}\\ ] ] where , @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent ( ra , dec ) of mrt and mrc sources , respectively .",
    "@xmath8 is defined up to a scale factor , hence the problem has 8 degrees of freedom .",
    "each point provides two equations , so a minimum of 4 point correspondences are necessary to fully constrain @xmath8 .",
    "the equation contributed by each corresponding pair can be re - arranged to obtain : @xmath12 a set of @xmath13 such equation pairs , contributed by @xmath13 point correspondences , form an over - determined linear system @xmath14 , as shown in eq .",
    "[ e : system ] .",
    "@xmath15 \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } h_{11}\\\\ h_{12}\\\\ h_{13}\\\\ h_{21}\\\\ h_{22}\\\\ h_{23}\\\\ h_{31}\\\\ h_{32 } \\end{array}\\right]= \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } x_{1}'\\\\y_{1}'\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ x_{n}'\\\\y_{n}'\\\\ \\end{array}\\right]\\ ] ]    this system can be solved by least squares based estimators . to obtain a good estimate of the transformation matrix we adopted the normalization scheme proposed by @xcite",
    "this ensures freedom on arbitrary choices of scale and coordinate origin , leading to algebraic minimization in a fixed canonical frame .",
    "figure  [ f : scheme ] shows the block schematic of the correction scheme .",
    "we identify bright ( above 15-@xmath0 ) sources common to the mrt and mrc catalogues .",
    "there are about 400 common sources in the steradian of the sky under consideration .",
    "a single @xmath16 homography matrix ( refer equation  [ eq : inhomog ] ) was estimated from this population .",
    "each pixel from the images was then projected to a new position using this matrix .",
    "figure  [ f : sourcecomparisoncorrect ] shows positional errors in dec after homography - based correction .",
    "compare these plots with figure  [ f : sourcecomparison ] .",
    "clearly , homography has managed to remove systematics and reduce the errors to well within 10% of the beamwidth for sources above 15-@xmath0 .",
    "figures  [ f : contourplots](a )  and  [ f : contourplots](b ) show mrt contours before and after correction , respectively , overlaid on sumss ( sydney university molonglo sky survey ) image @xcite , for a source around -67@xmath17 dec . the corrected mrt image contours in figure  [ f : contourplots](b ) overlap well with the source in sumss image .",
    "[ f : sourcecomparisoncorrect ]    [ f : contourplots ]",
    "the homography - based correction was able to correct for systematics in positional errors in the image domain and the errors are now well within 10% of the beamwidth for sources above 15-@xmath0 .",
    "the corrected mrt images are available for download at http://www.rri.res.in/surveys/mrt .",
    "positional error analysis clearly shows that mrt images are stretched in declination ( about 1 part in 1000 ) .",
    "this translates to a compression of the baseline scale , in the visibility domain , which cued towards possible errors in our estimation of the array geometry . by formulating a simple linear system , using instrumental phases estimated from three well separated calibrators whose positions",
    "are well known , the array geometry was re - estimated @xcite .",
    "the estimates show an error of about 1  mm / m .",
    "in other words , the error is about half a wavelength at 150  mhz ( 1  m ) for a 1  km baseline .",
    "this matches with the observed stretching of mrt images .",
