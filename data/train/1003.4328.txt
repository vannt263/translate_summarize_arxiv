    "the rapid advancement of wireless technology in the past years has started what some commentators call the  wireless revolution \" @xcite .",
    "this revolution envisions a world where one can access telecommunication services on a global scale without the deployment of local infrastructure . by increasing the adaptability , communication and cooperation capabilities of wireless devices",
    ", it may be possible to realize this revolution .",
    "presently , the frequency spectrum is allocated to different entities by dividing it into licensed lots . licensed users have exclusive access to their licensed frequency lot or band and",
    "can not interfere with the users in neighboring lots .",
    "the constant increase of wireless services has led to a situation where new services have a difficult time obtaining spectrum licenses , and thus can not be accommodated without discontinuing , or revoking , the licenses of others .",
    "this situation has been termed  spectrum gridlock \" ( @xcite ) and is viewed as one of the factors in preventing the emergence of new services and technologies by entities not already owning significant spectrum licenses . in recent years ,",
    "several strategies for overcoming this spectrum gridlock have been proposed @xcite . in particular , collaboration among devices and adaptive transmission strategies are envisioned to overcome this spectrum gridlock .",
    "that is , smart and well interconnected devices may cooperate to _ share _ frequency , time and resources to communicate more efficiently and effectively .",
    "the role of information theory in this scenario is to determine ultimate performance limits of a collaborating network . given the complexity of this task in its fullest generality , researchers have focussed on simpler models with idealized assumptions .",
    "one of the most well studied and simplest collaborative models is the genie aided cognitive interference channel .",
    "this channel is similar to the classical interference channel : two senders wish to send information to two receivers .",
    "each transmitter has one intended receiver forming two transmitter - receiver ( tx - rx ) pairs termed the primary and secondary ( or cognitive ) pairs / users . over the channel each transmitted message interferes with the other , creating undesired interference at the intended receiver .",
    "this channel model differs from the classical interference channel in the assumptions made about the ability of the transmitters to collaborate : collaboration among transmitters is modeled by the idealized assumption that the secondary ( cognitive ) transmitter has full a - priori ( or non - causal ) knowledge of the primary message .",
    "this assumption is referred to as genie aided cognition .",
    "the model was firstly posed from an information theoretic perspective in @xcite , where the channel was formally defined and the first achievable rate region was obtained , demonstrating that a cognitive interference channel , employing a form of asymmetric transmitter cooperation , could achieve larger rate regions than the classical interference channel .",
    "the first outer bound for this channel was derived in @xcite , together with the first capacity result for a class of channels termed  very weak interference \" in which ( in gaussian noise ) treating interference at the primary user as noise is optimal .",
    "the same achievable rate region was simultaneously derived in @xcite , where the authors further characterized the maximum rate achievable by the cognitive user without degrading the rate achievable by the primary user .",
    "a second capacity result was proved in @xcite for the so - called  very strong interference case \" , where , without loss of optimality , both receivers can decode both messages .",
    "the capacity is also known for the case where the cognitive user decodes both messages @xcite with and without confidentiality constraints .",
    "however , the capacity region of the genie aided cognitive radio channel , both for discrete memoryless as well as gaussian noise channels , remains unknown in general .",
    "tools such as rate - splitting , binning , cooperation and superposition coding have been used to derive different achievable rate regions .",
    "the authors of @xcite proposed an achievable region that encompasses all the previously proposed inner bounds and derived a new outer bound using an argument originally devised for the broadcast channel in @xcite .",
    "a further improvement of the inner bound in @xcite is provided in @xcite where the authors include a new feature in the transmission scheme allowing the cognitive transmitter to broadcast part of the message of the primary pair .",
    "this broadcast strategy is also encountered in the scheme derived in @xcite for the more general broadcast channel with cognitive relays , which contains the cognitive interference channel as special case .",
    "many extensions to the cognitive interference channel have been considered . in particular ,",
    "several papers have addressed the cognitive interference channel s idealized cognition assumption of non - causal , or a - priori message knowledge at one transmitter . a more realistic model of cognition",
    "is obtained by assuming a finite ( rather than infinite ) capacity link(s ) between the encoders - termed the interference channel with conferencing encoders . under the  strong interference condition \"",
    ", this channel model reduces to the compound multiple access channel whose capacity was determined in @xcite . another non - idealized model for cognition",
    "is the  causal cognition \" model in which the cognitive encoder has access to a channel output and causally learns the primary message .",
    "this models is a special case of the interference channel with generalized feedback of @xcite , which has considered in @xcite where an achievable scheme using block markov encoding was derived . in @xcite ,",
    "the impact of the knowledge of different codebooks is investigated .",
    "another natural extension of the cognitive interference channel model is the so called  broadcast channel with cognitive relays \" or  interference `` channel with one cognitive relay '' . in this channel model ,",
    "a cognitive relay in inserted in a classical interference channel .",
    "the cognitive relay has knowledge of the two messages and thus cooperates with the two encoders in the transmission of these two messages .",
    "the model contains both the interference channel and the cognitive interference channel when removing one of the transmitters and message knowledge ( for the interference channel ) and thus can reveal the optimal cooperation trade off between entities in a larger network .",
    "this model was first introduced in @xcite , where an achievable rate region was derived . in @xcite",
    "the authors introduced a larger achievable rate region and derived an outer bound for the sum capacity . in @xcite a yet larger inner bound is derived by having the cognitive transmitter send a private message to both receivers as in a broadcast channel .      in this paper",
    "we establish a series of new results for the discrete memoryless cognitive interference channel .",
    "section [ sec : definitions ] introduces the basic definitions and notation .",
    "section [ sec : available resuts ] summarizes the known results including general inner bounds , outer bounds and capacity in the  very weak interference \" and  very strong interference \" regimes .",
    "our contributions start in section [ sec : new outer bound ] and may be summarized as follows :    * a new outer bound for the capacity region is presented in section [ sec : new outer bound ] : this outer bound is looser than previously derived outer bounds but it does not include auxiliary random variables and thus it can be more easily evaluated . * in section [ sec : a new inner bound ] we present a new inner bound that encompasses all known achievable rate regions .",

    "better cognitive decoding \" regime in section [ sec : new capacity results ] : this regime includes the  very weak interference \" and the  very strong interference \" regimes and is thus the largest set of channels for which capacity is known . *",
    "section [ sec : semi - det cifc ] focuses on the semi - deterministic cognitive interference channel in which the output at the cognitive receiver is a deterministic function of the channel inputs .",
    "we determine capacity for this channel model by showing the achievability of the outer bound first derived in @xcite . * in section [ sec : det cifc ] we consider the deterministic cognitive interference channel : in this case both channel outputs are deterministic functions of the inputs .",
    "this channel is a subcase of the semi - deterministic case for which capacity is known . for this channel model",
    "we show the achievability of the outer bound proposed in section [ sec : new outer bound ] , thus showing that this outer bound is tight for this class of channels . *",
    "the paper concludes with some examples in section [ sec : examples ] which provide insight on the role of cognition .",
    "we consider two deterministic cognitive interference channel and show the achievability of the outer bound of section [ sec : new outer bound ] with transmission strategies over one channel use .",
    "the achievable scheme we propose provides interesting insights on the capacity achieving scheme in this channel model - the extra non - causal message knowledge at one of the transmitters allows a partial joint design of the codebooks and transmission strategies - and is easily appreciated in these simple deterministic models .",
