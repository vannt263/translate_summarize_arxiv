    "heavy quark baryons provide an interesting laboratory for studying and testing quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the theory of strong interactions .",
    "the heavy quark states test regions of the qcd where perturbation calculations can not be used , and many different approaches to solve the theory were developed . in this",
    "write - up we focus on @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 baryons .",
    "all four states were observed before and some of their properties measured.@xcite however , different mass measurements for @xmath5 and @xmath2 are inconsistent and the statistics for @xmath1 and @xmath2 is rather low . in addition",
    ", blechman and co - workers showed that a more sophisticated treatment , which would take into account the proximity of the threshold in the @xmath1 decay , yields a @xmath1 mass which is @xmath9 lower than the one observed.@xcite @xmath10 states were observed and studied in @xmath11 decays , while excited @xmath0 states decay mainly to a @xmath12 final state and decays through intermediated @xmath10 resonances are possible .",
    "one peculiarity of the experimental studies of these baryons is in their cross talks , which requires special care in the treatment of the background due to different kinematic regions allowed for different sources .    in this analysis",
    "we exploit a large sample of @xmath13 decays collected by the cdf detector to perform the measurement of the masses and widths of the discussed charmed baryons .",
    "we take into account all cross - talks and threshold effects expected in the decays under study.@xcite throughout this document the use of a specific particle state implies the use of the charge - conjugate state as well .",
    "the employed dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of @xmath14 and was collected using the displaced track trigger which requires two charged particles coming from a single vertex with transverse momenta larger than @xmath15 and impact parameters in the plane transverse to the beamline in the region of @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "the selection of the candidates is done in two steps . as all final states feature a @xmath0 daughter , as first step we perform a @xmath0 selection . in the second step",
    "we perform a dedicated selection of the four states under study . in each step",
    "we use neural networks to distinguish signal from background .",
    "all neural networks@xcite are trained using data only by means of the @xmath18 technique@xcite . as we use only data for the neural network trainings , for each case we split the sample to two parts ( even and odd event numbers ) and train two networks .",
    "each of them is applied to the complementary subsample in order to maintain a selection which is trained on a sample independent from the one to which we apply it .    in order to determine the mass differences relative to the @xmath0 and the decay widths of the six studied states ,",
    "we perform binned maximum likelihood fits of three separate mass difference ( @xmath19 ) distributions .",
    "the first two are @xmath20 and @xmath21 where the states @xmath22 and @xmath23 are studied .",
    "the last one is @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in each of the distributions we need to parametrize two signals and several background components .",
    "both @xmath22 and @xmath23 are described by a nonrelativistic breit - wigner function convolved with a resolution function .",
    "the resolution function is parametrized with three gaussians centered in zero and other parameters derived from simulated events .",
    "the mean width of the resolution function is about @xmath27 for @xmath22 and about @xmath28 for @xmath23 .",
    "we consider three different types of background , namely random combinations without real @xmath0 , combinations of real @xmath0 with a random pion and events due to the decay of excited @xmath0 to @xmath24 .",
    "thereby , random combinations without a real @xmath0 dominate and are described by a second - order polynomial with shape and normalization derived in a fit to the @xmath19 distribution from @xmath0 mass sidebands .",
    "the apparent difference between doubly - charged and neutral combinations is due to @xmath29 mesons with multibody @xmath30 decays , where not all @xmath30 decay products are reconstructed . in order to describe this reflection ,",
    "an additional gaussian function is used .",
    "the second background source , consisting of real @xmath0 combined with a random pion , is modeled by a third - order polynomial .",
    "as we do not have an independent proxy for this source , all parameters are left free in the fit .",
    "the last source , originating from nonresonant @xmath2 decays , is described by the projections of the flat @xmath24 dalitz plot on the appropriate @xmath20 respective @xmath21 axes .",

    "the brown and purple lines correspond to the two signal contributions , the green line represents the combinatorial background without real @xmath0 , the blue line shows real @xmath0 combined with a random pion and the red dotted line represents a reflection from excited @xmath0 decays .",

    "the red dashed line corresponds to the sum of all three background contributions.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in the fit for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , an additional complication compared to the @xmath10 case arises from the fact that previous measurements of the @xmath1 properties indicate that it decays dominantly to @xmath32 , which has its threshold very close to the @xmath1 mass .",
    "shows that taking into account the resulting strong variation of the natural width yields a lower @xmath1 mass than observed by former experiments . with cdf statistics we are much more sensitive to the details of the @xmath1 line shape than previous analyses .",
    "the @xmath1 parametrization follows ref .  .",
    "the state is described by a nonrelativistic breit - wigner function with a mass - dependent decay width which is calculated as integral over the dalitz plot containing the @xmath4 resonances .",
    "the pion coupling constant @xmath33 is related to the @xmath1 decay width and represents the quantity we measure instead of the natural width .",
    "the shape is then numerically convolved with a three gaussian resolution function determined from simulation , which has a mean width of about @xmath34 .",
    "the signal function for the @xmath2 is a nonrelativistic breit - wigner which is again convolved with a three gaussian resolution function determined from simulation .",
    "the mean width of the resolution function is about @xmath35 .",
    "the background consists of three different sources which are combinatorial background without real @xmath0 , real @xmath0 combined with two random pions and real @xmath36 combined with a random pion .",
    "the combinatorial background without real @xmath0 is parametrized by a second order polynomial whose parameters are determined in a fit to the @xmath19 distribution of candidates from @xmath0 mass sidebands .",
    "the second source , consisting of real @xmath0 combined with two random pions , is parametrized by a second order polynomial with all parameters allowed to float in the fit .",
    "the model of the final background source , real @xmath4 combined with a random pion , is based on a uniform function defined from the threshold to the end of the fit range , where the natural widths as well as the resolution effects of the @xmath22 are taken into account for the threshold determination .",
    "the size of this contribution is constrained to the @xmath4 yield obtained from fits to the projections of the @xmath24 dalitz plot from the upper @xmath2 mass sideband on the appropriate @xmath20 respective @xmath21 axes .",

    "the red dashed line corresponds to the sum of all three background contributions . ]",
    "we investigate several systematic effects which can affect our measurements .",
    "generally , they can be categorized as imperfect modeling by the simulation , imperfect knowledge of the momentum scale of the detector , ambiguities in the fit model and uncertainties on the external inputs to the fit of the @xmath1 signal .",
    "the most critical point is that we need to understand the intrinsic resolution of the detector in order to properly describe the signal shapes , because an uncertainty in the resolution has a large impact on the determination of the natural widths . as we estimate it using simulated events , it is necessary to substantiate that the resolution obtained from simulation agrees with the one in real data .",
    "we use @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 with @xmath40 for this purpose and compare the resolution in data and simulated events as a function of the transverse momentum of the pions added to @xmath30 or @xmath41 .",
    "we also compare the overall resolution scale between data and simulated events and find that all variations are below 20% which we assign as uncertainty on our knowledge of the resolution function .",
    "we select about 13800 @xmath42 , 15900 @xmath43 , 8800 @xmath44 , 9000 @xmath45 , 3500 @xmath25 and 6200 @xmath26 signal events and obtain the following results for the mass differences relative to the @xmath0 mass and the decay widths : @xmath46 for the width of the @xmath2 we get a value consistent with zero and therefore calculate an upper limit using a bayesian approach with a uniform prior restricted to positive values . at the 90% c.l .",
