    "the application of atomic spectroscopy techniques for studying nuclear properties has a very long tradition that goes back to the early days of modern physics . over the years",
    ", a large number of experiments have been carried out in order to determine , for example , isotope shifts of optical as well as x  ray transitions along various chains of isotopes , or to study the hyperfine structure of atomic levels . when compared to predictions from atomic theory , these measurements helped reveal important information about the spins , moments and charge radii of nuclear ground and isomeric states ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the last decades have witnessed a significant progress in developing optical laser spectroscopy techniques that allow probing of the structure of stable and especially radioactive nuclei .",
    "combined with modern accelerator and storage ring facilities , these techniques allow very accurate investigations of short  living exotic isotopes which are available only in small quantities  @xcite .",
    "while most atomic  spectroscopy studies on the shape and electro  magnetic moments of the nuclei usually deal with ( shifts in the ) transition energies or lifetimes of the excited levels , less attention has been paid so far to the analysis of the angular and polarization properties of bound  state atomic ( or ionic ) transitions .",
    "owing to the hyperfine coupling , however , these properties might be sensitive also to the spin @xmath5 as well as the magnetic @xmath6 and the quadrupole @xmath7 moments of the nucleus . for electron  impact excited helium - like sc@xmath8 ions , for example",
    ", the linear polarization of the characteristic k@xmath9 lines was found to be strongly affected by the hyperfine interaction and , hence , the nuclear properties  @xcite .",

    ", a general formalism is laid down that accounts for both , the many ",
    "electron correlation effects as well as the higher  order multipole components of the radiation field , and that includes the hyperfine  induced channels .",
    "while this formalism can be applied to _ all _ ions , independent of their particular shell structure , special attention is paid to the @xmath1 ( referred to as k@xmath0 ) decay of heavy , helium  like ions . for these ions ,",
    "the angular and polarization properties of the k@xmath0 lines can be investigated experimentally at storage ring facilities by applying the radiative electron capture ( rec ) of initially hydrogen  like ions @xcite to form the @xmath12 excited states .",
    "for the subsequent k@xmath0 emission of the ions into their @xmath13 ground state , a remarkable shift is shown especially for the linear polarization owing to the interference between the leading @xmath2 and hyperfine ",
    "induced @xmath3 decay channels of the @xmath14 fine  structure transition . moreover , since the magnitude of the @xmath3@xmath2 multipole mixing strongly depends on the ( nuclear ) spin @xmath5 and magnetic dipole moment @xmath15 of the corresponding isotope , we analyze and argue below how the x  ray polarimetry of the characteristic k@xmath0 emission can be utilized as a tool for studying these nuclear properties .",
    "during the last decades , various theoretical studies have been carried out in order to analyze the angular distribution and polarization of the characteristic radiation following the excitation of atoms and ions @xcite .",

    "@xmath63tl@xmath64 ions , the ( absolute value of ) degree @xmath88 reduces by about 20  % from @xmath89 to @xmath90 if , apart from the leading magnetic  quadrupole @xmath2 decay , the hyperfine  induced @xmath3 amplitude is taken into account . for helium - like @xmath84pb@xmath66 ions , in contrast , the shift in the polarization of the @xmath73 hyperfine transition does not exceed 5  % at any angle because of the ( much ) smaller magnetic moment @xmath91pb@xmath92 .    due to experimental limitations , however , it is hardly possible to directly compare the calculated polarization of the individual @xmath73 transition with measured data because of the relatively small ( @xmath93 2 ev ) energy separation between the @xmath94 and @xmath95 levels .",
    "for this reason , only the superposition of the k@xmath0 emission from the @xmath94 and @xmath96 levels can be recorded experimentally , following the rec into initially hydrogen  like ions .",
    "the linear polarization of such an incoherently averaged @xmath97 fine  structure transition is shown in the bottom panel of fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "as before , the calculations were performed within the magnetic  quadrupole approximation and by taking into account the interference between the @xmath3 and @xmath2 amplitudes for spin1/2 nuclei .",
    "although the @xmath98 level typically contributes with a larger weight than the @xmath99 one and can decay _ only _ via a @xmath2 quadrupole transition , the hyperfine  averaged @xmath97 fine  structure transition can still be clearly affected by the @xmath3@xmath2 multipole mixing .",
    "for instance , this mixing results in a reduction of the linear polarization @xmath100 by about 11  % for @xmath63tl@xmath64 ions , while the effect appears negligible for @xmath84pb@xmath66 ions for the same reasons as above .    accurate polarization measurements of the individual @xmath97 fine  structure transition are feasible today by using crystal spectrometers @xcite .",

    "moreover , the degree of polarization , @xmath107 , appears sensitive also to the _ sign _ of the magnetic dipole moment , @xmath15 . in order to illustrate this sensitivity , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] displays the linear polarization of the k@xmath0 emission for helium  like @xmath108dy@xmath109 ( left panel ) and @xmath110dy@xmath109 ions ( right panel ) .",

    "[ fig3 ] , the sign change results in a different shift of the ( degree of ) linear polarization @xmath114 towards _ lower _ or _ higher _ values .",
    "while the @xmath3@xmath2 interference depolarizes the k@xmath0 emission by about 4  % for @xmath115dy@xmath109 ions , the degree of polarization @xmath106 is enhanced by 3  % for the @xmath116dy@xmath109 isotope . as usual , the largest multipole  mixing effect can be observed at rather low collision energies for which the radiative electron capture results in a strong alignment of the excited ionic levels and , hence , in a large degree of polarization for the k@xmath0 line , independent of the spin and magnetic moment of the nuclei .",

    "in summary , we have studied the polarization of the characteristic radiation of few ",
    "electron ions with _ non - zero _ nuclear spins .",

    ", it is shown that the linear polarization of the k@xmath0 emission depends  more or less  sensitively on the magnetic dipole moment @xmath15 of the isotopes .",
    "therefore , a polarization  resolved analysis of the characteristic emission from helium  like ions may serve also as a new tool for studying the nuclear parameters , such as the spin and magnetic moments , of different isotopes .",
    "since simple few  electron systems are considered here , which is essential for reliable atomic calculations , these measurements may provide complementary information to conventional spectroscopy studies .    in order to explore the potential of the x  ray polarimetry for the analysis of stable or radio  active isotopes at accelerator facilities , computations have been performed especially for the k@xmath0 emission of helium  like ions following the radiative electron capture into the @xmath118 and @xmath119 levels of dysprosium , thallium and lead ions .",
