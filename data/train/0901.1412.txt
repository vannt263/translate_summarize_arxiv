    "in past decades , the question how to validly interpret scalar mesons with their mass below 1 gev stimulated many discussions and controversies @xcite .",
    "in the naive constituent quark model , they are expected to be @xmath2 nonet consisting of a quark and an antiquark , with one unit of orbital excitation for positive parity . however , due to the fact that the orbital excitation contributes energy about 0.5 gev , it is difficult to interpret their light mass as well as their mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath3 and @xmath4 couple to @xmath5 channel strongly , which is in contradictory to the prediction by naive @xmath6 mesons picture .",
    "this situation very naturally leads to alternative interpretation about these mesons , such as tetraquark states @xcite , which were put forward many years ago in @xcite .",
    "recently , t hooft _ et .",
    "_ @xcite and authors of @xcite found out new evidence from the instanton induced effective lagrangian , implying that the predominant component of light scalar meson is tetraquark .    in 1977 , using the mit bag model @xcite , jaffe suggested the existence of a light scalar nonet with masses below 1 gev @xcite .",
    "this nonet is composed by bound states of diquark and antidiquark .",
    "the dominant interaction generating the bound state is from one - gluon exchange which induces the following effective hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the strength factor constant , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are @xmath11 pauli matrices and @xmath12 gell - mann color operators for the @xmath13th quark .",
    "this is a simple generalization of the breit spin - spin interaction to include a similar color - color piece .",
    "it is also known as  color - magnetic \" or  color - spin \" interaction of qcd , which was first discussed in the pioneering work of de rujula , georgi , glashow @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we will call the eigenstates of @xmath14 as color - magnetic eigenstates .",
    "the eigenfunctions and corresponding eigenvalues of @xmath14 for @xmath15 system ( tetraquark ) have been presented in @xcite . in these work ,",
    "the eigenstate with the largest mass defect is @xmath16\\rangle,\\ ] ] with @xmath17 where @xmath18 stands for the @xmath19 , @xmath20 denotes flavor @xmath2-nonet , and @xmath21 $ ] ( @xmath22 $ ] ) represents the nonet belonging to @xmath23$]-representation ( @xmath24$]-representation ) of color - spin @xmath25 .",

    "while @xmath33 means the antidiquark is in the conjugate representation . and",
    "( 1,1 ) means the bound state of diquark and antidiquark is singlet both in color and spin . in the following , without ambiguity",
    ", the diquark and antidiquark will be denoted according to their @xmath29 representations .",
    "for example , @xmath34 diquark signifies the diquark s wavefunction is @xmath28 .",
    "similarly , @xmath35 is comprised of spin-0 @xmath36 diquark and @xmath37 antidiquark .",
    "basing on eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) , jaffe claimed that the scalar tetraquarks with masses below 1gev exist and the color - spin part of their wavefunctions can be described by @xmath38 .",
    "utilizing the latest data , jaffe s statement could be roughly checked for a visual comprehension .",
    "for instance , a data fit of charmed baryons determines the constituent quark masses @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the abbreviation of `` constituent '' .",
    "the strength factor constants related to the light quarks are @xmath41 then , if we assume @xmath42 as one member of @xmath18-tetraquark nonet , the mass of @xmath42 could be roughly estimated : @xmath43 obviously , jaffe s claim is reasonable , and the underlying dynamical consideration should be legitimate .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to study jaffe s tetraquark in the framework of qcd sum rule which relates the nonperturbative aspects of qcd to the hadronic physics @xcite . in other words",
    ", we will try to obtain a legitimate qcd sum rule for tetraquarks in terms of their color - magnetic eigenfunctions .",
    "qcd sum rule ( sr ) analysis for scalar nonet mesons as tetraquarks has been widely discussed in the literature ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "since the correlator of tetraquark - type current operator for sr has higher energy dimension than that of ordinary baryon - type one , the operator product expansion ( ope ) must be considered up to higher dimensional operators ( condensates ) than ordinary baryons .",
    "technically , it has been widely accepted that the ope contributions from condensates of dimensions higher than eight are very small for tetraquarks @xcite .",
    "to single scalar tetraquark current , it has been shown in @xcite that the contributions from the dimension eight condensates are unexpectedly large and become dominant in the left hand sum rule .",
    "what is worse , their negative contributions break down the physical meaning of the left hand sum rule . in order to solve this problem , in @xcite",
    ", the authors demonstrated that the current including equal weight of scalar and pseudoscalar diquark - antidiquarks leads to a strong cancelation of the contributions from dimension eight operators in the ope , and then gives a good sum rule . in @xcite , by assuming mixing of single tetraquark currents , the authors performed a sr analysis for low - lying @xmath18-mesons as tetraquarks .",
    "however , by now , all work on tetraquark sr has not considered a basic question that whether the color - spin - flavor structures of the tetraquark - type currents in sr are consistent with the color - magnetic hyperfine interaction mechanism on tetraquarks . the aim of this paper is to pursue this question .",
    "the key point of this paper is that we think the interpolating current used in sr should inherit a color - spin - flavor structure from the color - magnetic wavefunction .",
    "this means that we treat a current standing for linear combination of @xmath37-@xmath36 and @xmath34-@xmath44 tetraquarks as the sr interpolating current .",
    "we emphasize that this combination or mixture of @xmath37-@xmath36 and @xmath34-@xmath44 tetraquarks is determined dynamically by eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) without any additional _ ad hoc _ assumptions . due to the non - relativistic nature of color - magnetic interaction",
    ", it should be aware of that the induced mixture is specific to energy scale around 1gev , which is mass scale of mesons we are interested in .",
    "in short , our method is based on the well established concept that color - magnetic hyperfine interactions play a crucial role in multiquark physics .",
    "the strategy of the calculation is what follows . at the first step",
    ", we will study the properties of the scalar tetraquark @xmath2-nonet as color - magnetic eigenstate with the largest mass defect in qcd sum rule by ope expansion . with the method presented in section 2",
    ", we construct interpolating currents that can represent the color - magnetic structure of tetraquark . then utilizing these currents , and following the standard procedure for tetraquark s ope calculations @xcite",
    ", we obtain the contributions from the operators up to dimension eight .",
    "meanwhile , to achieve a reliable sum rule , we require that the pole contributions should reach around @xmath45",
    ". then we obtain @xmath46 meson mass @xmath47mev .",
    "in addition , the instanton effects , in other words the topological fluctuations of gluon fields , play an important role in the structure of qcd vacuum @xcite and spectroscopy of multiquark hadrons @xcite .",
    "so they should be taken into account in the sr calculations . combining the contribution from ope and instanton",
    ", we obtain @xmath46 mass about 720 mev close to previous ope results . at this stage ,",
    "a complete sum rule description of @xmath0 nonet meson has been obtained by us , including both the ope and instanton effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we will deduce the interpolating currents for @xmath0 tetraquarks from their color - magnetic wavefunctions . in section iii ,",
    "the analytic results of ope calculation based on previous currents will be presented , followed by the numerical results . in section iv",
    ", the single direct instanton contribution will be considered . in section",
    "v , we summarize the results briefly and make a speculation on the extension of our method to study mesons with 6 quarks ( fermi - yang meson ) . in appendix , we will list some necessary formulas of spectral functions and correlators .",
    "substituting eqs . ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) into ( [ 2 ] ) , we obtain the expression of the color - magnetic wavefunction for jaffe s @xmath0 tetraquark nonet meson as follows @xmath48 the elements for @xmath49 are @xmath34 , @xmath36 diquarks and @xmath50 , @xmath51 anti - diquarks . generally , the composite operator for a diquark with certain structure of color , flavor and spin is @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are color and flavor indices of quarks respectively .",

    "likewise , the composite operators of @xmath44 spin-1 antidiquark are @xmath71 because @xmath72 means that the diquark and antidiquark are anti - symmetric in color , spin and flavor .",

    "these notations lie with how the diquark and anti - diquark operators vary under lorentz transformation . in terms of eqs .",

    "<S> in this paper , we study the @xmath0 nonet mesons as tetraquark states with interpolating currents induced from the color - magnetic wavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> this wavefunction is the eigenfunction of effective color - magnetic hamiltonian with the lowest eigenvalue , meaning that the state depicted by this wavefunction is the most stable one and is most probable to be observed in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> our approach can be recognized as determining interpolating currents dynamically . </S>",
    "<S> we perform an ope calculation up to dimension eight condensates and find that the best qcd sum rule is achived when the current induced from the color - magnetic wavefunction is a proper mixture of the tensor and pseudoscalar diquark - antidiquark bound states . </S>",
    "<S> compared with previous results , to sigma(600 ) and kappa(800 ) , our results appear better , due to larger pole contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the direct instanton contribution are also considered , which yields a consistent result with previous ope results . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we also discuss the @xmath1 problem as a possible six - quark state . </S>"
