    "strong electromagnetic turbulence is a common phenomenon in high - energy - density ( he d ) environments . in the laboratory settings , manipulating and understanding electromagnetic turbulence is essential to fusion energy science and the inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , electromagnetic turbulence is critical to numerous astrophysical systems such as gamma - ray bursts and supernova shocks @xcite , as well as in laboratory astrophysics laser - plasma experiments@xcite .    despite much variation in the origin of the electromagnetic turbulence ( e.g. , the weibel or filamentation instabilities ) ,",
    "most of these plasmas have one thing in common : their configuration is such that binary coulomb collisions are negligible ; i.e. , the plasmas are `` collisionless '' . nonetheless , some of these environments , such as plasmas at `` collisionless '' shocks , display phenomena that resemble conventional collisional interactions .",
    "hereafter , we colloquially refer to these phenomena as `` quasi - collisional '' .    in this work , we will show that sub - larmor - scale ( `` small - scale '' ) magnetic turbulence induces particle dynamics reminiscent of binary coulomb interactions .",
    "in fact , as we will demonstrate , the random small - angle deflections of electrons by small - scale magnetic fields leads to an effective collisionality with the effective `` collision '' frequency being equal to the ( small - angle ) pitch - angle diffusion coefficient .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ s : pitching_it ] briefly reviews the analytic theory of pitch - angle diffusion in small - scale random magnetic fields .",
    "next , we argue that the small - angle deflections , characteristic of these fields , are analogous to the small deflections induced by coulomb collisions .",
    "we then show that the pitch - angle diffusion coefficient , itself , acts as an effective collision frequency . in section [ s : coll_eqs ]",
    ", we explore the implications for electromagnetic wave propagation in magnetized plasmas with high `` effective collisionality '' or `` quasi - collisionality '' . finally , section [ s : concl ] is the conclusions .",
    "unless otherwise specified , we use cgs units throughout the paper .",
    "magnetic fluctuations are known to occur on various spatial scales .",
    "we define the fluctuation scale as sub - larmor if the electron s ( fluctuation ) larmor radius , @xmath0 is greater than , or comparable to , the spatial correlation length , @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 is the dimensionless particle velocity , @xmath4 is the rms value of the fluctuating field , @xmath5 is the electron mass , @xmath6 is the speed of light , @xmath7 is the electric charge , and @xmath8 is the electron s lorentz factor .    formally , the correlation length is defined over all spatial scales of the magnetic field .",
    "nonetheless , any realization of electromagnetic turbulence may be envisioned as the superposition of `` small - scale '' and `` large - scale '' ( i.e. , the `` sub- '' and `` super - larmor - scale '' ) components .",
    "thus , we may roughly define two characteristic spatial scales for the general case , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the sub - larmor - scale and super - larmor - scale correlation lengths , respectively .    ignoring the mean magnetic field",
    ", there are a number of different regimes that may be enumerated , depending upon the relative significance of the magnetic field at each scale .",
    "firstly , if the correlation length is infinite , then the electrons will follow helical orbits about the axis of a perfectly homogeneous magnetic field . next , if the magnetic field is `` large - scale ''  i.e. , possessing fluctuations on a finite , though super - larmor , spatial scale  then the electron s guiding center will drift , due to slight inhomogeneity in the magnetic field .    thirdly , an electron moving through purely sub - larmor - scale magnetic turbulence will not complete a larmor orbit , because the magnetic field varies on a scale shorter than the larmor curvature radius . with @xmath11 ,",
    "this trajectory is a nearly straight line , with small , random ( diffusive ) deflections perpendicular to the direction of motion .",
    "finally , when a range of spatial scales exists , the chaotic trajectory will be a combination of large - scale gyro - motions ( though not necessarily complete gyro - orbits ) with small - scale diffusive deflections .",
    "we argue that it is these small - scale deflections that induce a _",
    "quasi - collisionality _ with the pitch - angle diffusion coefficient acting as an effective collision frequency .",
    "consider an electron moving through a random magnetic field with the mean value @xmath12 .",
    "the total magnetic field can be written as : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the mean - free , `` fluctuation '' field , i.e.  @xmath16 , but @xmath17 .",
    "the pitch - angle diffusion coefficient , due to deflections in purely small - scale magnetic turbulence , is a known function of statistical parameters .",
    "it may be obtained by considering that the electron s pitch - angle experiences only a slight deflection , @xmath18 , over a single magnetic correlation length .",
    "consequently , the ratio of the change in the electron s transverse momentum , @xmath19 , to its initial momentum , @xmath20 , is @xmath21 , since @xmath22  where @xmath23 is the transverse lorentz force and @xmath24 is the time to transit @xmath1 .",
    "the subsequent deflection will be in a random direction , because the field is uncorrelated over the scales greater than @xmath1 .",
    "as for any diffusive process , the mean squared pitch - angle grows linearly with time .",
    "thus , the diffusion coefficient appears as @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the electron deflection angle ( pitch - angle ) with respect to the electron s initial direction of motion , @xmath27 is the component of the fluctuation field perpendicular to the electron s velocity , and @xmath28 is an appropriate ensemble - average over the electron velocities .    in general , any anisotropy in the fluctuation field will induce a path - dependent correlation length .",
    "thus , the diffusion coefficient along an axis of anisotropy ( which is usually along the direction of the mean magnetic field , @xmath29 ) may differ from that across the transverse plane .    for simplicity ,",
    "unless otherwise specified , we will assume that the magnetic turbulence is statistically homogeneous and isotropic . with this assumption , the pitch - angle diffusion coefficient will be the same along all directions , and thus we may arbitrary define the axis of the deflection angle , @xmath26 . without loss of generality , we may then define @xmath26 as the conventional pitch - angle , i.e. , the angle of the velocity vector with respect to the mean ( ambient ) magnetic field , @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , we will assume that all relevant time - scales ( e.g. , the time to transit @xmath1 ) are much smaller than the magnetic field variability time - scale  thus , we may treat the magnetic turbulence statically , thereby ignoring any time - dependence in the correlation length , and therefore in @xmath30 .",
    "in the typical treatment , coulomb collisions are considered in the small deflection angle regime . in this approximation",
    ", a `` test '' electron will undergo a slight ( transverse ) deflection as it passes by an ion .",
    "additionally , electron - electron collisions are neglected .",
    "many scatterings will occur , as the binary collisions continue with subsequent ions .",
    "these scatterings are effectively stochastic , if the background of ( stationary ) ions is randomly distributed .",
    "since the collisions with the fixed ion background are elastic , the total electron energy is conserved .    nevertheless",
    ", the small deflections accumulate , leading to a gradual change in the electron s transverse momentum , @xmath31 .",
    "an electron is deflected by one radian , i.e. @xmath32 , in a single collision time , @xmath33 .",
    "the inverse of the collision time , @xmath34 , is defined as the electron - ion collision frequency .",

    "we employ the spitzer result for the coulomb logarithm @xcite : @xmath41 , \\label{col_log}\\ ] ] which is valid for temperatures above @xmath42 .",
    "next , we will argue that the pitch - angle diffusion coefficient of eq .",
    "( [ daa ] ) acts as an effective collision frequency in plasmas with sub - larmor - scale magnetic fluctuations .",
    "the small - angle magnetic deflections are analogous to electron - ion collisional deflections in a number of ways , namely they both ( i ) conserve particle s energy and ( ii ) induce deflections transverse to the initial electron s velocity .    where the two effects differ , however , is in the nature of the stochasticity . in an idealized scenario , an electron in a collisional plasma",
    "is continuously deflected by ions along its trajectory .",
    "in contrast , an electron moving through small - scale magnetic turbulence is deflected on a characteristic spatial scale of finite length : the correlation length .",
    "thus , the two descriptions are only equivalent on a coarse - graining .",
    "indeed , the electron motion in small - scale magnetic turbulence resembles electron - ion collisions only on spatial scales much greater than the magnetic correlation length .",
    "thus , we must require that : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the characteristic length scale of the system .",
    "next , we may infer this effective collision frequency directly from eq .",
    "( [ daa ] ) .",
    "the pitch - angle deflections are assumed to be small , hence @xmath45 .",
    "thus , at @xmath33 , the following condition must hold : @xmath46 therefore , @xmath30 must be the effective `` collision '' frequency .",
    "in general , electron - ion collisions in plasmas are often important too , hence we include them in our study . consequently , we define the total ( effective ) collision frequency as : @xmath47      electrons undergoing collisions with an ion background will emit bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "the emission coefficient , @xmath48  the radiant power per unit frequency per unit volume per unit solid - angle  is directly proportional to the collision frequency . for a maxwellian ( thermal ) distribution of electrons in a weakly ionized plasma ,",
    "the emission coefficient is @xcite @xmath49\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2k_bt_e}{8\\pi^3c^3}\\right)\\nu_{ei } , \\label{comb_emiss}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 $ ] is the real part of the plasma s index of refraction , @xmath51 is the electron plasma frequency , @xmath52 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath53 is an electron - ion collision frequency . now , taking into account quasi - collisions as in eq .",
    "( [ coll_eff ] ) , by substituting @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ comb_emiss ] ) , the latter introduces a phenomenological definition for the effective collision frequency .    in a similar fashion",
    ", electrons undergoing pitch - angle diffusion in small - scale magnetic turbulence emit small - angle jitter radiation @xcite . the total ( dispersion free ) jitter power emitted by a single electron is given by the larmor formula @xcite , i.e. , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the classical electron radius .",
    "the small - angle jitter radiation spectrum has a characteristic frequency known as the jitter frequency , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the dominant wave number of the ( small - scale ) turbulent fluctuations .",
    "next , we may write the spectral power for a single electron as : @xmath59 substitution of eq .",

    "( [ spec_pow_diff ] ) with the multiplication of @xmath63 .",
    "thus : @xmath64 finally , the emission coefficient for non - relativistic jitter ( pseudo - cyclotron ) radiation , given a maxwellian distribution of electrons , will be : @xmath65\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2k_bt_e}{2\\pi^3c^3}\\right)d_{\\alpha\\alpha } , \\label{jitt_emiss_nonrel}\\ ] ] where we have reintroduced the index of refraction , and substituted @xmath66 comparing eqs .",
    "( [ jitt_emiss_nonrel ] ) and ( [ comb_emiss ] ) , we see that they only differ by a numerical factor .",

    "to explore the properties of electromagnetic ( em ) wave propagation in quasi - collisional , magnetized plasmas , we examine the components of the dielectric tensor , @xmath67 .",
    "consider an em wave of frequency @xmath68 and with a wave - vector @xmath69 , propagating through a `` cold '' magnetized plasma with an ambient magnetic field , @xmath29 . choosing a coordinate system with @xmath70 parallel to the @xmath71-axis , and @xmath72 in the @xmath73-@xmath71 plane ,",

    "this introduces the substitution rule : @xmath79 .",

    ", we predict _ negative _ @xmath172 values in these environments . these results are crucial for faraday rotation - based laboratory plasma diagnostics and interpretation of the results of astronomical observations of faraday rotation measures of magnetized astrophysical and space plasmas , e.g. , of the interstellar and intracluster media .    in the laboratory setting , we find that small - scale turbulence may complicate the propagation of em waves through high - intensity laser - plasmas ; specifically , solid - density laser - plasmas .",
    "namely , the reflectivity and absorption of @xmath133- and @xmath124-modes is largely affected when the plasma is highly `` collisional '' .",
    "in fact , for sufficiently high ( quasi-)collisionality , the plasma cutoff frequencies cease to exist .",
    "these effects can have crucial implications for the icf performance .",
    "indeed , the high quasi - collisionality regime occurs when the weibel instability or other kinetic filamentation instabilities are excited to produce strong sub - larmor magnetic ( or possibly fully electro - magnetic ) fields . in this regime , the plasma may happen to be transparent so that the critical surface ceases to exist .",
    "the impulse delivered to the imploding plasma by radiation pressure halves in the case ( cf .",
    "reflection vs. absorption ) , which greatly affects icf performance .",
    "for the same reason , the absorption coefficient reduces too , so that the depth through which radiation can penetrate into the target increases , which changes the energy deposition profile in the target . how theis affect the icf performance remains to be seen from dedicated theoretical analyses and numerical simulations .",
    "on the other hand , we stress that the performance , being affected by quasi - collision - induced transparency which depends on @xmath175 , can be controlled by the ambient magnetic field , @xmath166 , both via the weibel instability suppression ( by lowering @xmath176 ) and the reduction of the effective quasi - collisionality of the plasma ( by increasing @xmath166 for a fixed @xmath176 ) .",
    "we should also mention that the role of small - scale electric fields ( of the order of the skin depth , as in langmuir turbulence , for example ) has not been investigated here .",
    "however , the scattering effect of such fields is expected to be similar to the magnetic fields , although the particle energy may no longer be constant in scatterings .",
    "thus , we expect the electrostatic and fully electromagnetic fields to result in qualitatively similar effects , though quantitative predictions may differ .",
    "we propose that quasi - collisional magneto - optic effects may be exploited for diagnostic purposes .",
    "since the effective quasi - collision frequency  the pitch - angle diffusion coefficient , eq .",
    "( [ daa ] )  is proportional to the magnetic field correlation length and the square of the small - scale magnetic fluctuations , it provides a novel means by which the statistical properties of the small - scale magnetic turbulence may be identified .",
    "additionally , the jitter radiation spectrum readily provides a phenomenological definition for the effective collision frequency , _  la _ eq .",
    "( [ jitt_emiss ] )",
    ". jitter radiation may be directly observable in several of these plasma environments , e.g. , high - intensity solid - density laser plasmas @xcite .",
    "our model , nonetheless , has some limitations . in particular",
    ", strong sub - larmor - scale magnetic fluctuations are not likely present in all collisionless or weakly collisional plasmas .",
    "leading candidates for the existence of strong fluctuations include : collisionless shocks in gamma - ray bursts and early moments of supernova explosions , high - intensity laser plasmas , and turbulent solar wind and magnetosphere / magnetotail plasmas .",
    "our principal assumption that the system spatial scale is much greater than the small - scale magnetic correlation length seems to rule out most interstellar and intergalactic plasmas , where the magnetic correlation lengths are believed to be @xmath177 and @xmath178 , respectively @xcite . allowing for hidden small - scale components ( with smaller correlation lengths ) in these environments requires unrealistically large magnetic fields to keep the absorption _ e - folding _ distance at parsec to kiloparsec scales ; this is required so that a signal may not be completely absorbed in transit .    to conclude",
    ", the obtained results suggest that small - scale magnetic fluctuations conceal a `` collisional '' signature , which may provide a useful radiative diagnostic of magnetic micro - turbulence in laboratory , astrophysical , space and solar plasmas , as well as significantly affect performance of inertial confinement fusion and laser plasma experiments .",
