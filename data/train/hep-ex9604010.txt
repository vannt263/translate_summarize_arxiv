    "next generation @xmath0 linear colliders , firstly to be operated at center of mass energies ( @xmath2 ) of 300 - 500 gev ( phase 1 ) and to be then upgraded to 1 tev or higher ( phase 2 ) , have been proposed by several groups in recent years  @xcite . at the first phase of such colliders the main target is the higgs boson , the only undiscovered participant in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "according to the recent precision electroweak measurements at lep and slc , supersymmetry ( susy ) has become more favorable . in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) ,",
    "two higgs doublets are necessary to give the masses of up and down type fermions .",
    "two neutral scalars ( @xmath3 ) , a pseudoscalar ( @xmath4 ) and a pair of charged higgs ( @xmath5 ) are introduced in this extended higgs sector . the mass of the lightest neutral higgs ( @xmath6 ) is smaller than that of the @xmath7 boson ( @xmath8 ) at tree level . even if radiative corrections are taken into account , @xmath6 is at most @xmath9 130 gev for a top mass ( @xmath10 ) of 170 gev  @xcite .",
    "this situation does not change significantly in extended susy models  @xcite .",
    "therefore if susy is correct , discovery of at least one neutral higgs boson is guaranteed at the first phase . after having discovered the higgs boson as the discovered higgs boson . ] , the next step is to distinguish whether the higgs is sm - like or susy - like .",
    "this can be done by measuring the ratio of branching fractions @xmath11 or almost equivalently @xmath12 as @xmath13 . ] . in the mssm",
    "these values are smaller than those of the sm .",
    "as the value @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) has a strong correlation to the @xmath4 mass ( @xmath16 ) and almost independent from the susy energy scale ( @xmath17 ) , it is pointed out that a constraint on @xmath16 can be obtained from this measurement  @xcite .",

    "= .55    [ branch - azero ]    the mass of the bottom quark ( @xmath19 ) is important in this relation , since the ratio @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath20 .",
    "we can use the measurement of @xmath21 to determine @xmath19 , through the relation @xmath22 which is valid both in the sm and susy models .    the total production cross section of the process @xmath23 ( @xmath24 )",
    "can be determined by counting the events , in which the @xmath7 decays into a pair of leptons whose recoil mass is consistent with the higgs mass .",
    "this technique is valid even if @xmath25 has decay channels to undetectable particles such as neutralinos , since only the @xmath7 decay products are used in the event selection .",

    "therefore we perform here an extended simulation study focusing on the measurement of the ratio @xmath1 assuming a sm - like higgs , where we try to improve the measurement as follows ;    * setting @xmath26300 gev to avoid large background from top pair productions * using all the @xmath7 decay modes to reduce statistical errors * studying the effect of beam polarization to reduce electroweak background .",

    "the cross sections with 90 % polarized electron beam , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the number of left - handed and right - handed electrons , respectively . ] are obtained from the cross sections and angular distributions calculated with grace  1.1 .",
    "the 4-momenta of all decay products given by the event generator are fed into a fast detector simulation program which is based on a smearing method with the standard parameters of the jlc - i detector given in ref .",
