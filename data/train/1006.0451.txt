    "studies of @xmath4 and @xmath5 boson production at hadron colliders , provide valuable insight into the qcd production mechanism .",
    "the decay channels , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , offer colourless final states , whose kinematic distributions probe the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the colliding hadrons .",
    "more precise pdfs will ultimately improve our sensitivity to new physics signals at hadron colliders .    in @xmath9 collisions ,",
    "@xmath4 bosons are mostly produced via the scattering of valence @xmath10 or @xmath11 quarks from the proton , with the corresponding isospin partner antiquark from the antiproton . since @xmath10(@xmath12 ) quarks carry more of the proton(antiproton ) momentum than @xmath11(@xmath13 ) quarks , @xmath14 s tend to be boosted along the proton direction , and @xmath15 s along the antiproton direction .",
    "this production asymmetry , @xmath16 , is defined as    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the @xmath4 boson rapidity .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath18 , and thus also @xmath16 are not directly measurable in @xmath6 decays , due to the unknown momentum of the neutrino along the beam direction .",
    "however , given an additional constraint to the known @xmath4 boson mass , it is possible to estimate @xmath18 on a statistical basis , assuming the well understood @xmath19 decay coupling  @xcite .",
    "this analysis technique was adopted by the cdf collaboration in a recent measurement of @xmath16 , with 1 fb@xmath1 of data in the electron channel  @xcite .    a directly measurable observable , which is also sensitive to @xmath16 ,",
    "is the analogous lepton charge asymmetry , @xmath2 defined as @xmath20 where @xmath3 is the lepton pseudorapidity .",
    "@xmath2 is less directly sensitive to the pdfs , since it is a convolution of the production asymmetry with the decay asymmetry of the @xmath19 coupling in the decay vertex ; the two of which tend to cancel",
    ". however , the production asymmetry dominates at small @xmath3 and/or large , hence the sensitivity to pdfs is enhanced by further binning in .",
    "the d0 collaboration has measured @xmath2 with 300 pb@xmath1 in the muon channel  @xcite , and 700 pb@xmath1 in the electron channel  @xcite .",
    "this document describes a measurement of @xmath2 in the muon channel , using 4.9 fb@xmath1 of data  @xcite , which supersedes  @xcite .",
    "the d0 detector is detailed in  @xcite . here , only the features that are essential to this measurement are described .",
    "closest to the interaction region , an inner tracker covering the region @xmath21 @xmath22 3 , and within a 2 t solenoidal magnet determines the momentum and charge of muons . a liquid argon and uranium calorimeter is contained within three separate cryostats ; it determines the missing transverse energy of the event , and provides isolation information for muon identification purposes .",
    "finally , a muon spectrometer covering the region @xmath21 @xmath22 2 , with wire chambers , and trigger scintillator counters , either side of a 1.8 t toroidal magnet identifies muon candidates .",
    "an important feature of the d0 detector , is that both magnet polarities are reversed periodically , such that the analysed data set contains roughly equal luminosities for each of the four combinations .",
    "this dramatically reduces the effect of any charge asymmetry in muon reconstruction efficiencies .",
    "candidate @xmath0 events are required to fire a single muon trigger and contain one muon reconstructed in the muon spectrometer , which is also spatially matched to a track in the inner tracker with @xmath23 @xmath24 20 gev .",
    "timing cuts based on muon scintillator information reject cosmic ray muons .",
    "additionally , the muon candidate must be isolated in the calorimeter and inner tracker in order to reject jets that fake muons , or semi - leptonic decays of hadrons within jets",
    ". the missing transverse energy , , must be greater than 20 gev , consistent with a high transverse momentum neutrino , and the transverse mass , @xmath25 = @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the azimuthal opening angle between the muon and the neutrino , must be greater than 40 gev .",
    "the measured @xmath2 must be corrected for the following :    1 .   detector resolution and acceptance , 2 .",
    "backgrounds , 3 .",
    "charge mis - identification .    in order to determine corrections for detector resolution and acceptance ,",
    "@xmath0 signal events are generated using pythia  @xcite , and passed through a detailed geant  @xcite based simulation of the d0 detector , before being overlaid with randomly triggered events from data .",
    "the simulation is further corrected for differences compared to data , in muon reconstruction efficiencies and momentum resolution .",
    "systematic uncertainties on the detector corrections are estimated by varying the momentum resolution in the simulation within its uncertainty .",
    "backgrounds from @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 processes , are simulated in the same way as the signal , and are subtracted from the data .",
    "multijet backgrounds are estimated directly from data .",
    "the efficiency for a jet to fake a muon , @xmath31 , is estimated from a sample of muon candidates which are back - to - back in azimuth with a reconstructed jet , that also fired a jet trigger .",
    "the missing transverse energy of the event is required to be less than 10 gev , in order to suppress @xmath0 signal .",
    "systematic uncertainties on @xmath31 , are estimated by adding requirements that further suppress signal contamination .",
    "the charge mis - identification rate is estimated using @xmath29 candidate events , and is found to have negligible effect on the measurement .",
    "after cp folding ( assuming @xmath32 ) , figure  [ figure : results ] compares the measured @xmath2 with nlo qcd predictions from from resbos  @xcite using cteq 6.6 pdfs  @xcite , with qed radiative corrections from photos  @xcite .",
    "the yellow bands represent the pdf uncertainties on the predictions . for inclusive ,",
    "the data and prediction agree well .",
    "however , the agreement is rather poor once the measurement is split into bins of .",
    "the charge asymmetry of muons from from @xmath0 decays , @xmath2 , has been measured using 4.9 fb@xmath1 of data collected by the d0 detector . predictions from nlo qcd with cteq 6.6 pdfs are able to describe the data for inclusive muon , but rather poor agreement with the data is observed in bins of .",
    "apart from the highest @xmath3 bins , the data are more precise than the predictions , and will thus provide tight constraints on future pdfs .     with nlo qcd predictions for ( top )",
