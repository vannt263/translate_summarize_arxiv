    "we are in the process of performing a deep x - ray survey ( @xmath14  ms ) of the hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ; williams et  al .",

    "( hereafter ; weisskopf et  al .",
    "this field was chosen because of the excellent radio , submillimeter , infrared , and optical studies already completed ( see livio , fall , & madau 1998 and ferguson et  al .",
    "2000 for reviews ) .",
    "the hdf - n itself is the most intensively studied extragalactic patch of sky , and it is one of only two such regions ( the other being the hubble deep field south ) with high - resolution imaging down to 2829@xmath15 magnitude in several optical bands . by centering our survey on the hdf - n ,",
    "we ensure that the best possible data will be available for follow - up of the faintest x - ray sources ever detected .    in hornschemeier et  al .",
    "( 2000 , hereafter h00 ) , we presented the first results for the hdf - n based on 164.4  ks of  exposure .",
    "these results were extended to 221.9  ks over an area much larger than the hdf - n in hornschemeier et  al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter h01 ) and g.p .",
    "garmire et  al .",
    ", in preparation ( hereafter g01 ) ; eight sources in the hdf - n itself were reported .",
    "the total exposure on the hdf - n field has recently been more than doubled to 479.7  ks ; these new data have allowed the detection of several additional hdf - n sources and substantially improved the x - ray constraints on the previously detected sources . here",
    "we present the additional sources as well as improved constraints on sources in the hdf - n itself and on one source in its immediate vicinity .",
    "we also use stacking analyses to probe the average x - ray emission properties of hdf - n galaxies that are not individually detected in the x - ray band .",
    "the galactic column density along this line of sight is @xmath16  @xmath1 ( stark et  al .",
    "@xmath17  km  s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 and @xmath18 are adopted throughout this paper .",
    "coordinates throughout this paper are j2000 .",
    "the field containing the hdf - n was observed with the  advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; g.p .",
    "garmire et  al . , in preparation ) for a total exposure time of 257.9  ks on 2000 november 2123 ( 167.0  ks ; observation i d 1671 ) and 2000 november 2425 ( 90.9  ks ; observation i d 2344 ) .",
    "the background was stable during the first observation , but there was significant background flaring due to `` space weather '' during @xmath19  ks of the second observation . during this @xmath19",
    "ks the background was @xmath10 times higher , but this has had little impact on the analysis or results presented here .",
    "the hdf - n was placed near the aim point for the acis - i array on ccd i3 during both observations .",
    "these data were added to the 221.9  ks of data presented in h01 ; the entire hdf - n was covered for all observations and was kept away from gaps between the ccds .",
    "several improvements over the data reduction techniques of h01 have been made .",
    "the most recently processed data from the  x - ray center were used , and the standard @xmath20 pixel randomization was removed .",
    "interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) version  2.0 tools were used whenever possible in place of some of the custom software used for h01 .",
    "all data were corrected for the radiation damage sustained by the ccds during the first few months of  operations using the procedure of townsley et  al .",
    "this procedure partially corrects for the positionally dependent grade distribution due to inefficient charge transfer in the radiation - damaged ccds .",
    "it also partially corrects for quantum efficiency losses , which are most significant in non - corrected data at @xmath21  c ( see townsley et  al .",
    "2000 and h01 for discussion of the remaining small quantum efficiency losses incurred ) .",
    "the absolute astrometry was determined following the method in  3.1 of h01 ; absolute x - ray source positions in the hdf - n itself are accurate to @xmath22 or better .",
    "we created images from 0.58.0  kev ( full band ) , 0.52.0  kev ( soft band ) , 28  kev ( hard band ) and 48  kev ( ultrahard band ) using the two event grade sets defined in table  1 ; hereafter these will be called the `` standard  grade set '' and the `` restricted acis grade set . ''",
    "the use of the restricted acis grade set improves our ability to detect faint sources in some cases , as discussed in brandt et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) and t.  miyaji et  al .",
    ", in preparation .",
    "the basic reason for this improvement is that the restricted acis grade set rejects a significantly higher fraction of background events than source events ( after correction for the radiation damage ) . with the restricted acis grade set ,",
    "the average soft - band and hard - band background levels are reduced by 36% and 28% relative to the levels with the standard  grade set ( see table  1 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the bright source cxohdfn  j123646.3 + 621404 ( see below ) loses 12% of its soft - band counts and 14% of its hard - band counts when the restricted acis grade set is used instead of the standard  grade set .",
    "source detection was performed with wavdetect ( freeman et  al . 2001 ) .",
    "our criterion for source detection is that a source must be found with a false - positive probability threshold of @xmath23 in at least one of the four bands using either the standard  or restricted acis grade sets .",
    "the 12 sources found in this manner are listed in table  2 .",
    "all photometry in table  2 is for the standard  grade set . in table  2",
    "we also report results for one  source located just outside the hdf - n , cxohdfn  j123642.0 + 621331 .",
    "figure  1 shows the detected sources in the full , soft and hard bands ( the ultrahard - band image is not shown since only two sources are detected ) .",
    "some of the sources outside the hdf - n that are not labeled in figure  1 are discussed in h01 , while others will be discussed in a future publication . conservatively treating the eight images searched as entirely independent , @xmath24",
    "false sources are expected statistically .",
    "all sources have been manually inspected to be certain that they are not produced or affected by `` cosmic ray afterglows '' (  x - ray center 2000 , private communication ) . finally , images made with other grade set choices ( e.g. , only acis grade  0 events ) were searched ; no additional sources were detected .",
    "wavdetect was also run in the various bands to search for lower - significance counterparts ( matching to within @xmath20 ) of the highly significant sources already detected at the @xmath23 level in at least one of the four bands ; in these runs we used probability thresholds of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "since the spatial - matching requirement greatly reduces the number of pixels being searched , the statistically expected number of false cross - band matches obtained in this manner is very small .",
    "the only two cases where new cross - band matches were found with probability thresholds of @xmath25 or @xmath26 are noted in table  2 .",
    "the nature of the multiwavelength counterparts to our new x - ray sources supports the validity of the x - ray detections ( see  3.1 for details on the multiwavelength counterparts ) .",
    "for example , four of the five new x - ray sources align with radio sources ( see table  3 ) , extending the trend established for this field at brighter x - ray fluxes ( h00 ; h01 ) .",
    "given the precise x - ray and radio positions , the a priori probability of such an alignment is small ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "similarly , the probability of alignment with optically bright , low - redshift galaxies is small ( compare with  4.1 of h01 ) .",
    "the one new x - ray source in  3.1 that is not a radio source aligns with an optically bright galaxy .",
    "the `` effective exposure time '' per source , as derived from our exposure map , ranges from 444464  ks ( see h01 for discussion ) .",
    "even with these long exposure times , the  acis is entirely photon limited for point - source detection near the aim point . for a power - law model with photon index @xmath28 and the galactic column density , our @xmath29",
    "count detection limit corresponds to soft - band and hard - band flux limits of and , respectively .",
    "all sources have been checked for count - rate variability using kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) tests , and the results are reported in table  2 .",
    "such testing is statistically valid even when the number of counts is small , although clearly the sensitivity of the k - s test is reduced when only a few counts are available .",
    "use of the k - s test avoids a posteriori selection problems as discussed by press & schechter ( 1974 ) .",
    "the testing is always performed in the band where a source has its highest signal - to - noise ratio , and the standard  grades were used in this analysis .",
    "we have used @xmath30 apertures for count extraction ; these are appropriate since the hdf - n was kept close to the aim point for all observations .",
    "gaps between observations were accounted for in the testing .",
    "the two sources showing statistically significant evidence for variability are discussed in  3.2 .",
    "figure  2 shows the  sources detected thus far overlaid on the w96 hdf - n image , and table  3 gives the identification information for these sources .",
    "below we describe the properties of the newly detected sources .    _ cxohdfn  j123642.0 + 621331 : _ this x - ray source lies just outside the hdf - n itself and is positionally coincident with the remarkable @xmath6jy radio source  ( e.g. , richards et  al .",
    "1998 ; garrett et  al . 2001 ) .",
    "detailed studies of this source indicate a redshift of @xmath7 ( waddington et  al .",
    "1999 ; r.a .",
    "windhorst 2001 , private communication ; but also see  2.2 of barger , cowie , & richards 2000 ) ; we shall adopt this redshift throughout the rest of the discussion below as the other redshift possibilities appear less likely .",
    "this source is thought to be powered by either a dust - enshrouded agn or an ultraluminous starburst .",
    "if the redshift is correct , then this is the most distant x - ray source detected thus far in our  field and the ninth most distant cosmic object detected in x - rays ( after seven quasars and one gamma - ray burst ) .",
    "the 0.52.0  kev observed - frame bandpass in which  is most clearly detected corresponds to a rest - frame bandpass of 2.710.8  kev .",
    "the implied luminosity in this bandpass of @xmath31  erg  s@xmath2 strongly supports the presence of an agn .    in figure  3",

    "2000 ) .",
    "we have estimated , the slope of a nominal power law between 2500    and 2  kev in the rest frame .",
    "a @xmath35 power law was adopted for the x - ray continuum ( following reeves & turner 2000 ) , and an optical power - law slope of @xmath36 ( see schneider , schmidt , & gunn 1991 and fan et  al .",
    "2001 ) was used to calculate the 2500    flux density from the ab@xmath32 magnitude .",

    "there is no evidence that the x - rays are strongly suppressed by internal absorption , although given that we are only sensitive to hard x - rays in the rest frame the intrinsic @xmath38 is only constrained to be @xmath39  @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast to the results from optically and radio selected agn surveys ,  surveys do not show a significant decrease in the space density of high - redshift , high - luminosity agn ( see  5 of miyaji , hasinger , & schmidt 2000 ) .",
    "our x - ray detection of the moderate - luminosity agn  at @xmath34 should ultimately be useful for pinning down the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) of agn when combined with the results from other deep x - ray surveys . at present",

    "3.2 it was shown that the hard spectrum of cxohdfn  j123646.3 + 621404 is almost certainly due to intrinsic x - ray absorption , and this is probably the case for cxohdfn  j123651.7 + 621221 as well .    in figure  10",

    "two @xmath95 galaxies lying near ( but unrelated to ) relatively bright  sources were removed from consideration to minimize background and avoid any contamination ( sources 3 - 400.0 and 3 - 659.0 in w96 ) .",
    "the x - ray data for all @xmath95 galaxies were manually inspected to ensure that none of them is an x - ray source lying just below the detection limit ; none of the sources contains a point source with @xmath96 full - band counts , and most would not admit a point source with @xmath97 full - band counts ( after subtraction of the expected background ) .",
    "the resulting galaxy sample has 17 objects with @xmath98 from 19.922.5 including 11 spirals , three ellipticals and three irregulars ( see table  4 and figure  2 ) .",
    "none of these galaxies is known to have broad optical emission lines ( cohen et  al .",

    "( 1998 ) and richards ( 2000 ) .",
    "the effective exposure time of the stacked image is 7.7  ms , and we have used the restricted acis grade set in this analysis .    if the galaxies under study are indeed x - ray sources , some of them are likely to have their x - ray emission offset from their nuclei ( as for the cases of cxohdfn  j123641.7 + 621131 and cxohdfn  j123649.5 + 621345 ) , but without a priori knowledge of the location of this emission we are limited to stacking these galaxies at their nuclei ( with one exception ; see table  4 ) .",
    "given the optical extents of these galaxies , x - ray emission up to @xmath99 from the nucleus is plausible in most cases",

    "79 counts were detected in these 30 pixels while 49.7 are expected from background .",
    "the poisson probability of obtaining 79 counts or more when 49.7 are expected is only @xmath100 , so full - band x - ray emission from the average galaxy is detected with high significance .",
    "figure  11b shows that the full - band x - ray emission appears to be well centered on the nuclear positions of the galaxies , although the centroid position is in fact uncertain at the @xmath101 level due to the combination of limited photon statistics , background , and the acis pixel size .",
    "there also appears to be a detection in the stacked soft - band image .",
    "following the same procedure as for the full - band image , we obtain 29 events when 10.5 are expected ; the corresponding poisson probability is @xmath102 .",
    "the soft - band emission centroid appears somewhat offset from the nuclear positions ( see figure  11c ) , although as above we note that the centroid position is fairly uncertain .",

    "given that 30 pixels are being searched in each case , the respective probabilities of false detections are @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "monte - carlo simulations were also performed to examine the reliability of the stacking analyses ; good agreement was obtained with the poisson statistics calculations above ( see appendix  a ) . finally , these stacking analyses are not subject to biases such as those discussed by eddington ( 1913 ) because the number of sources under consideration is fixed and was not determined using the x - ray data .",
    "one concern with the interpretation of an average brightness from a stacking analysis is that simply dividing the observed number of counts by the number of sources does not necessarily yield an accurate estimate of the characteristic brightness of the population ; e.g. , the bulk of the observed counts might be produced by only one or two sources . in this study , however , we believe that averages do reasonably reflect typical brightnesses . in the full - band stacking above , for example , there are @xmath107 observed counts from 17 sources .",
    "no individual source , as noted above , has @xmath96 counts .",
    "therefore at least @xmath108 sources , and very likely more , are contributing to the observed counts .",
    "we have repeated the stacking analysis above for only the 11 spirals with @xmath95 ( see table  4 ) ; the effective exposure time of the resulting stacked image is 5.0  ms . in the full - band image we obtain 47 events when 32.1 are expected ( see figure  11d ) ; the corresponding poisson probability is @xmath109 , and the monte - carlo analysis in appendix  a gives essentially the same probability . this detection is significant at the 99.2% confidence level .",

    "sources not detected individually in x - rays , we have stacked them but do not obtain statistically significant point - source detections in any of our bands .",
    "the upper limit on a point source in the full - band stacked image is @xmath110 counts in 3.2  ms ( this is a 95% confidence upper limit calculated following kraft , burrows , & nousek 1991 ) . adopting the spectral model used in  2.2 , the upper limit on the full - band flux of the average source is @xmath111  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 .",
    "with the new data , the number of  sources detected in the hdf - n itself has risen from eight ( h01 ) to 12 .",
    "nine of these 12 sources are detected in the full band , 11 are detected in the soft band , six are detected in the hard band , and two are detected in the ultrahard band .",

    "we also note that the hosts of both cxohdfn  j123641.7 + 621131 and cxohdfn  j123649.5 + 621345 have fairly low optical luminosities , and in each of these cases the x - ray source appears to be spatially offset from the nucleus ( and thus is presumably not associated with a supermassive black hole )",
