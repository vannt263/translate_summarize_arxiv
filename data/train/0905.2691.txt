    "it is believed that solar magnetic fields are created in the tachocline , the interface between the convection zone and the radiative interior . due to buoyancy instabilities ,",

    "the largest emerging active regions produce sunspots with magnetic fluxes in excess of @xmath4 mx and lifetimes of several weeks to months .",
    "smaller active regions consist of pores and contain an order of magnitude less flux , persisting over days to weeks .",
    "the smallest emerging regions detected to date are the so - called ephemeral regions .",

    "* ) .    outside of active regions ,",
    "the quiet sun has proved to be full of magnetic fields with strengths roughly in equipartition with the photospheric convective flows @xcite .",
    "an important question is the origin of these fields .",
    "@xcite suggested that horizontal internetwork fields represent concentrated loops of flux carried to the surface by the upflows of granular convection or by magnetic buoyancy . in a recent paper ,",
    "@xcite indirectly traced the emergence of magnetic flux and reconstructed , for the first time , the three dimensional topology of the magnetic field vector in quiet regions of the solar photosphere .",
    "it was found that at least 20% of the magnetic flux in the quiet sun is connected by low - lying magnetic loops .",
    "later , @xcite studied time series of spectropolarimetric observations taken with the solar optical telescope aboard _ hinode_. these authors followed the time evolution of one magnetic loop in the internetwork , showing that they appear on spatial scales smaller than 2@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite demonstrated that the emergence of magnetic flux on granular scales brings large amounts of horizontal fields to the photosphere both in plage regions and in the quiet sun .",
    "another form of flux emergence has been reported by @xcite .",
    "it involves the appearance and subsequent disappearance of what seem to be _ vertical _ fields at the center of granular cells .",
    "the observations strongly suggest that a significant fraction of the magnetic flux in the quiet sun might be the result of the emergence of small - scale magnetic loops .",
    "but , where do the loops come from ? are they created by the global solar dynamo , by a local dynamo , or by recycling of flux from decaying active regions ? is the emergence process a local phenomenon confined to the photosphere or does the magnetic flux reach higher atmospheric layers ?",
    "the answers to these questions bear important consequences for our understanding of the magnetic and thermal structure of the solar atmosphere .",
    "for example , @xcite claim that the magnetic energy stored in the quiet photosphere is sufficient to balance the radiative losses of the chromosphere .",
    "quiet sun magnetic fields are excellent candidates to solve the chromospheric and coronal heating problem , but a mechanism capable of transferring their energy to the upper layers has not been identified yet . from a theoretical point of view , it is not clear whether the fields of the quiet solar photosphere can rise to the chromosphere . @xcite",
    "have presented mhd simulations in which the magnetic field emerges into the photosphere in the form of small - scale @xmath0-loops .",
    "they reach the chromosphere and get reconnected with the local expanding vertical magnetic fields , heating the plasma and generating high frequency mhd waves that propagate into the corona . however , the magnetoconvection simulations of @xcite show @xmath0-loops that disintegrate as they rise through the solar atmosphere .",
    "these discrepancies emphasize the need for observational studies aimed at determining whether magnetic fields emerging into the quiet photosphere are able to reach higher atmospheric layers . here",

    "hinode _ and the dutch open telescope to address this question .",
    "we also characterize the physical properties of small - scale magnetic loops in the quiet sun , providing estimates of their magnetic fluxes , emergence rates , lifetimes , sizes , and velocities .",
    "the data analyzed in this paper consist of time series of polarimetric and imaging observations of quiet sun regions at disk center .",

    "the exposure time per slit position was set to 1.6  s to track very rapid events .",

    "it emerges in a granular region , perhaps because the upward granular motions help the field lines to rise from below the solar surface @xcite .",
    "the los velocity maps show photospheric upflows at the position of the footpoints , confirming that the loop is rising . for the moment",
    ", however , the magnetic field remains in the lower photosphere : we do not observe circular polarization signals in the b magnetograms or brightenings in caiih that could be associated with the loop .",
    "interestingly , the strong photospheric network element with negative polarity located towards the bottom of the scan , at a height of about one fourth of the displayed fov , is well observed both in the b magnetograms and the ca filtergrams , and will remain so during most of the time sequence .",
    "this nicely illustrates the capabilities of our observations : magnetic structures that are visible in the polarization maps but not in  b or h are intrinsically lower in the solar atmosphere",
    ".    between @xmath59 s and @xmath60 s the linear polarization signals disappear below the noise .",
    "the positive footpoint has drifted to an intergranular lane and is concentrated , whereas the negative footpoint continues to be rooted in the granule and is more diffuse .",
    "the distance between them increases steadily .",
    "we still see upward motions in the photospheric velocity maps .",
    "since the loop is moving to higher layers , it is reasonable to conclude that the linear polarization disappears because the apex of the loop leaves the formation region of the 630  nm lines .",
    "however , no traces of the loop are detected yet in  b or h.    at @xmath61 s , weak circular polarization signals cospatial with the photospheric footpoints are observed in the b magnetograms for the first time .",
    "this indicates that the loop has reached the upper photospheric / lower chromospheric layers where the central part of the  b line forms .",
    "interestingly , the  b dopplergram exhibits downflows of about @xmath62  km  s@xmath3 at the position of the positive footpoint .",
    "the downflows could represent plasma moving along the legs of the loop as the whole structure reaches high atmospheric layers .",
    "these motions may be essential for the loop to get rid of part of its mass before it can emerge into a less dense medium .    at @xmath63",
    "s , the loop is nearly out of the region scanned by the sp .",
    "the signals in the  b magnetogram are much more intense and correspond to footpoints rooted in intergranular lanes . from now on the distance between the footpoints will increase , but at a slower rate than when they were crossing granular structures .",
    "this inflection point can be seen in fig .",
    "[ dist ] , where we plot the footpoint separation as a function of time .",
    "the distance is computed only when the two footpoints are visible , both in the maps ( squares ) and in the  b magnetograms ( triangles ) . in the first 500 s of the loop evolution , the distance between the footpoints increases linearly at a rate of 5.9  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the mean velocity of the footpoints is 2.95  km  s@xmath3 , a value compatible with the motion of the granular plasma .",
    "the linear increase of the separation with time is a common feature of the loops and indicates that they do not undergo a free random walk ( otherwise the distance would increase as the square root of time ) . towards the end of the loop evolution",
    "the separation rate slows down , coinciding with the arrival of the footpoints to intergranular lanes .",
    "summarizing , the loop emerges in a granule and the horizontal granular motions drive the magnetic field lines to the closest intergranular space , where strong downdrafts capture and stabilize them . when this happens , the separation between the footpoints is about 4000  km .    at @xmath64",
    "s , the footpoints are clearly visible in the  b magnetogram and exhibit downflows in the b dopplergram .",

    "the lifetimes vary from some 2 min up to 40 min , although most of the loops disappear in less than 10 minutes .",
    "the maximum separation between the footpoints is a strong function of the lifetime and ranges from @xmath142  km to 4000 km .",
    "many loops reach horizontal dimensions comparable to , or larger than , those of granules .",
    "therefore , they must be viewed as coherent structures capable of withstanding the conditions of the granular environment for a relatively long time .",
    "the initial velocity of separation between the footpoints does not seem to have any relationship with the other parameters listed in the table .",
    "values of 0.1 to 6  km  s@xmath3 are typical .",
    "as already mentioned , the separation speed tends to decrease when the footpoints reach the intergranular space , likely because horizontal motions there are not as vigorous as in the interior of granular cells .",
    "the longitudinal magnetic fluxes measured in the footpoints range from @xmath143 to @xmath144 mx at the level of formation of the 630 nm lines mx , considerably larger than the rest of values .",
    "this might be an artifact caused by the difficult separation of ml24 and the strong network element with which it interacts . ] .",
    "therefore , the loops have smaller fluxes than ephemeral regions and should be placed at the lower end of the flux distribution observed in emerging active regions .",
    "the magnetic flux density in the footpoints is typically 2040  mx  cm@xmath3 . to infer the magnetic field strength from the magnetic flux density values we need to know the filling factor of the field lines that build the loop structure and their inclination .",
    "the footpoints should be relatively vertical because of geometrical reasons .",
    "assuming that the fields occupy most of the resolution element , i.e. , that the magnetic filling factor is close to unity the field strength of the loops can be estimated to be of order 10 - 100  g. only if the filling factor is much smaller than unity would the field strength increase to kg values , but we consider this possibility unlikely in view of fig .",
    "[ hist_ratio_flux ] .",
    "an important result is that 23% of the loops are detected in the b magnetograms after their appearance in the photosphere ( 16 cases out of 69 ) .",
    "it takes an average of 5 minutes for the loops to move from the photosphere to the height at which the b measurements form , although faster and slower ascents have been observed too .",
    "all the loops detected in the  b magnetograms develop downflows at the same heights .",
    "in addition , 15% of the loops are seen as bright points in  h line - core filtergrams .",
    "this means that an important fraction of the magnetic flux that emerges into the photosphere reaches the chromosphere . as they travel upward ,",
    "the loops are observed in the magnetograms , the  b magnetograms , the  b dopplergrams , the  h line - core images , and the cn filtergrams ( in this order ) .    by contrast , 77% of the loops never make it to the chromosphere .",
    "we have been unable to identify any parameter determining whether a given loop will rise or not .",
    "this includes the total magnetic flux and the magnetic flux density",
    ". however , low - lying loops tend to have lifetimes shorter than 500  s and separations smaller than 500 km . thus it may simply be that they do not last long enough to reach high atmospheric layers .",
    "further work is clearly needed to explain why a substantial fraction of the loops remain low - lying .",
    "also , the relation between these structures and the transient horizontal fields described by @xcite should be investigated , given their similar lifetimes and magnetic topologies .",
    "the observations described above demonstrate that magnetic fields do emerge into the quiet solar atmosphere in the form of small - scale loops , confirming the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the loops are detected as a patch of linear polarization flanked by two circular polarization signals of opposite polarity . in nearly all the cases",
    "the linear polarization appears before or at the same time than the stokes @xmath24 signals , as can be expected from @xmath0-shaped loops rising through the atmosphere . only in two cases out of 69",
    "have we detected linear polarization after the loop had already disappeared . in those cases",
    ", the footpoints were approaching each other .",
    "this behavior is compatible with a loop that emerges and then submerges in the photosphere , or with a `` magnetic bubble '' , i.e. , a circle of magnetic field lines .",
    "the long duration of our time series has permitted us to discover the existence of emergence centers in which several loops appear one after the other .",
    "for example , there is a @xmath146 region of the solar surface where we have detected 9 events in a time interval of 1 h. the complete set of observations covering this period is provided as an mpeg animation in the electronic edition of the astrophysical journal .",
    "some of the loops even appear at the very same position .",
    "the example shown in fig .",
    "[ ej1_crom ] belongs to this area .",
    "the existence of emergence centers may have important consequences for the origin of the loops .",
    "these regions act as subsurface reservoirs of magnetic flux that is transferred intermittently to the photosphere by an as yet unkwnown mechanism .",
    "the loops generally emerge in granules or at their edges , although there are exceptions of loops appearing in dark areas .",
    "as the loops emerge the footpoints separate and the linear polarization fades away . in most cases ,",
    "the footpoints do not describe rectilinear trajectories .",
    "figure [ trayectorias ] shows the paths followed by the two polarities of the loops observed on september 25 , 2007 ( loops ml09 to ml17 in the table 2 ) .",
    "the red curves correspond to the example discussed in fig.[ej1_crom ] . in this case",
    "the footpoints described quite a rectilinear path , similarly to emerging active regions and ephemeral regions .",
    "however , the majority of loops show more complicated trajectories .",
    "the reason is that , in general , they emerge in granules and drift toward the closest intergranular lane . when the footpoints reach the intergranular space they stay there and are passively advected by the flow .",
    "this creates complicated trajectories .",
    "the important point , however , is that the magnetic field is sufficiently weak as to be pushed and moved around by the granular flow , but _ without being destroyed in the process_. the loops remain coherent during all their lifetime , as if the granular flow did not exist .    during their evolution ,",
    "the loops interact with other magnetic flux concentrations that cross their paths .",
    "if the loops stay long in the photosphere , the footpoints cancel with elements of opposite polarity or are absorbed by patches of the same polarity .",
    "loops that experience a fast evolution have more probabilities of avoiding other magnetic elements and often disappear without undergoing any interaction .    in seeking the origin of the loops it is of interest to determine the magnetic orientation of their footpoints .",
    "if the loops are caused by the global solar dynamo , one may expect a regular ordering of the footpoints at the moment of emergence .",
    "this is what happens in active regions , where the signs of the leader and follower polarities are governed by hale s rules ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "all the loops considered here appeared in the northern hemisphere during solar cycle 23 . in that cycle ,",
    "leader polarities were positive in the northern hemisphere and negative in the southern hemisphere .",
    "figure [ tilt ] shows an histogram of the orientation of our small - scale emerging loops .",
    "the tilt angle is defined to be the angle between the solar equator and the line joining the positive footpoint with the negative one , measured from the west .",
    "the angles compatible with the orientation of sunspot polarities during solar cycle 23 in the northern hemisphere are those between 90 and 270@xmath147 . even if the statistical sample is not very large , the loops seem to have nearly random orientations .",
    "thus , we conclude that they do not obey hale s polarity rules , much in the same way as the shortest - lived ephemeral regions @xcite .",
    "recent observations of hanle - sensitive lines @xcite and zeeman - sensitive lines @xcite suggest that a significant fraction of the quiet sun is occupied by magnetic fields",
    ". apparently , these fields are weak and isotropically distributed in inclination @xcite .",
    "one way to shed light on their nature is to study how they emerge in the surface and what their contribution is to the energy budget of the solar atmosphere .    on granular scales",
    ", magnetic flux appears in the solar photosphere as transient horizontal fields @xcite and small - scale magnetic loops @xcite .",
    "we have studied the latter in detail using seeing - free observations made by _",
    "hinode_. in 28 hours of _ hinode _ data we have detected 69 small - scale loops emerging in a quiet sun region of size @xmath148 at disk center .",
    "the occurrence rate is thus 0.02 events hr@xmath3 arcsec@xmath1 .",
    "the loops show clear spectropolarimetric signatures with a central region of linear polarization and two patches of circular polarization of opposite polarity .",
    "the longitudinal flux observed in each footpoint ranges from @xmath143 to @xmath144 mx , with an average of @xmath149 mx .",
    "this means that the loops represent the smallest emerging flux regions detected to date ( ephemeral regions have fluxes above 10@xmath150 mx ; zwaan 1987 ) .",
    "the rate at which magnetic flux is carried to the quiet photosphere by the loops can be estimated to be @xmath151  mx  s@xmath3  arcsec@xmath1 , or @xmath152  mx over the solar surface per day .",
    "this is about half the value derived by lites et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for horizontal internetwork fields , but still enormous ( see @xcite for a comparison with the flux emergence rates in active and ephemeral regions ) .    in the photosphere ,",
    "the linear polarization associated with the top of the loop disappears soon , while the circular signals tracing the loop legs are observed to separate with time .",
    "this behavior is consistent with field lines moving upward through the solar atmosphere .",
    "also the upflows observed in the stokes v zero - crossing velocities at the position of the footpoints confirm the ascent of the loops .",
    "23% of the loops are detected in  b magnetograms that sample the upper photosphere or the temperature minimum region ( say , 400  km above the continuum forming layer ) .",
    "there is a time delay of about 5 minutes between the first detection in the photosphere and the appearance in the  b magnetograms , implying an ascent speed of the order of 1  km  @xmath3 .",
    "some of the loops continue to travel upward and become visible in  h line - core filtergrams as small brightness enhancements .",
    "thus , a fraction of the loops are able to reach the low chromosphere , carrying magnetic flux with them .",
    "the rise of small - scale magnetic loops may provide an efficient mechanism to transfer substantial amounts of energy from the photosphere to the chromosphere .",
    "this would support claims by @xcite and @xcite that the tangled fields of the quiet sun store sufficient energy to heat the chromosphere .",
    "a related question is whether the small - scale loops rise up to the transition region or even the corona .",
    "the observations required to answer this question are quite challenging due to the different spatial resolutions attainable with present day optical , euv , and x - ray instruments , but should be pursued .",
    "about 77% of the loops that appear in the solar surface never rise to the chromosphere .",
    "these loops have the shortest lifetimes and show the smallest footpoint separations ; other than that , they do not differ from those reaching higher layers .",
    "usually , they disappear close to their emergence sites .",
    "the fields associated with these loops might represent the tangled quiet sun fields deduced from hanle measurements @xcite , but a definite conclusion can not be made without studying the compatibility of hanle and zeeman measurements .    what is the origin of the small - scale magnetic loops ?",
    "one possibility is that they are created by the solar dynamo at the bottom of the convection zone , as part of a larger toroidal flux tube .",
    "@xcite presented three - dimensional mhd simulations of the last stages of the emergence of one such tube .",
    "they placed a horizontal tube at the top of the convection zone , just beneath the photosphere . when the initial magnetic flux is smaller than @xmath15310@xmath150 mx , the tube is not sufficiently buoyant to rise coherently against the convective flows and fragments . at the surface",
    ", the process of flux emergence occurs on very small spatial scales ( typically 1000 - 2000 km ) and short time scales ( 5 min ) .",
    "these properties are compatible with our observations .",
    "thus , the small - scale loops we have detected may simply be the result of weak flux tubes distorted by the granulation as they emerge from the convection zone into the photosphere .",
    "the fragmentation of the tubes might explain why there are emergence centers where loops appear recurrently one after the other .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the footpoint orientations suggests that the loops do not show a tendency to be aligned according to hale s rules .",
    "this can be regarded as a considerable difficulty against the idea that the origin of the loops is the solar dynamo .",
    "however , it may also be a natural consequence of the interaction of the tube s fragments with the near - surface granular convection if it removes all the information carried originally by the tube .",
    "another possibility is that the magnetic loops represent flux recycled from decaying active regions . in a sense , the mhd simulations of abbett ( 2007 ) , @xcite , and @xcite model such a process , because all of them assume an initial magnetic field in the computational box which could be provided by decaying active regions . in the simulations ,",
    "the field evolve and interact with the granular flows .",
    "this interaction creates a significant amount of horizontal fields , even if the initial field is purely vertical .",
    "moreover , the simulations show the emergence of magnetic loops on granular scales .",
    "the loops are less coherent than classical flux tubes and do not connect to deeply rooted field lines . in this scenario , the magnetic fields of the quiet sun , and thus the emergence events we have described , would be the consequence of local processes acting on the remnants of decaying active regions .",
    "yet another possibility is that the loops represent submerged horizontal magnetic fields carried to the surface by the upward motions of granules or by magnetic buoyancy , as modeled by @xcite . even in that case",
    ", the origin of such submerged fields would be unknown .",
    "nowadays , we do not have enough observational constraints to distinguish between a surface dynamo or a `` exploding '' magnetic flux tube emerging from the solar interior .",
    "determining the nature of the magnetic loops observed in internetwork regions is important for a better understanding of the magnetism of the quiet sun and its role in the heating of the solar atmosphere .",
    "future efforts should concentrate on the solution of these problems .",
    "in addition to high - resolution photospheric observations , polarization measurements in the chromosphere are recquired to track the evolution of the loops with height .",
    "these data can now be provided by two - dimensional spectrometers like ibis , crisp , or imax .",
