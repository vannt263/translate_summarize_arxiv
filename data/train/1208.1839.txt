    "recent experimental studies of the superconducting state of cecoin@xmath1(see @xcite and references cited therein ) provided evidences in favor of the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase existence in the high magnetic field region of the superconducting phase diagram .",
    "originally @xcite the nonuniform fflo state has been predicted to exist in superconductors when the magnetic field is acting on the electron spins only ( the case of the paramagnetic effect ) .",
    "usually it is an orbital effect which is the most important and this makes difficult the experimental observation of the fflo phase .",
    "moreover the superconductor must be in the clean limit because the electron scattering is detrimental for the fflo phase @xcite .",
    "the orbital effect may be weakened in heavy fermion superconductors or in quasi-2d superconductors when magnetic field is applied parallel to the superconducting planes .",
    "that is why in addition to the heavy fermion superconductor cecoin@xmath2 , quasi - one and quasi - two - dimensional organic superconductors are considered as good candidates for the fflo phase realization @xcite,@xcite .",
    "recently evidences of the fflo state have been revealed in organic quasi-2d superconductors @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4 fecl@xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6-(bedt - ttfs)@xmath7 cu(ncs)@xmath4 @xcite .    in the framework of an isotropic model with s - wave pairing the critical field for",
    "the fflo phase in the presence of the orbital effect has been calculated by gruenberg and gunther @xcite .",
    "they demonstrated that the fflo state may exist if the ratio of pure orbital effect @xmath8 and pure paramagnetic limit @xmath9 is larger than 1.28 , i.e. the maki parameter @xmath10 is larger 1.8 .",
    "the pure paramagnetic limit at @xmath11 can be estimated as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the bcs gap at @xmath11 and @xmath14 is the bohr magneton saintjamessarma . in @xcite",
    "the exact solution for the order parameter was described by an fflo modulation along magnetic field and the zero landau level function for the coordinates in the perpendicular plane .",
    "further analysis @xcite revealed that the higher landau level solutions ( lls@xmath15 become relevant for large values of maki parameter @xmath16 and the @xmath17 curve may present regions described by different lls . these results obtained for an isotropic model are readily generalized for the case where the electron spectrum anisotropy is described by an elliptic fermi surface @xcite .",
    "in such a case the maki parameter becomes angular dependent and the transitions between different lls may occur with a change of orientation of the magnetic field .",
    "it happens that for an adequate description of the fflo state in real compounds , the form of the fermi surface as well as the type of the superconducting pairing play a very important role because they determine the direction of the fflo modulation .",
    "this circumstance has been demonstrated @xcite in the framework of a general phenomenological approach based on the modified ginzburg - landau ( mgl ) functional @xcite .",
    "this approach is adequate near the tricritical point ( tcp ) in the field - temperature phase diagram . at the tcp",
    "the three transition lines meet : the lines separating the normal metal , the uniform superconducting state and the fflo state . near the tcp",
    "the wave vector of fflo modulation is small and this situation may be described by the mgl functional . for the case when the deviation of the fermi surface from the elliptical form is small the method @xcite permits to calculate the critical field corresponding to different lls .",
    "( section  [ sec:2 ] ) unfortunately the approach @xcite is limited to weak deviations from the elliptic fermi surface . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we develop a numerical method for the calculation of the upper critical field applicable to any cases , using a general form of the solution for the order parameter as a superposition of the different lls .",
    "note that the single lls is an exact solution for the order parameter only for isotropic or quasi - isotropic ( elliptic fermi surface ) cases .",
    "otherwise the order parameter is described by an infinite serie of the lls .",
    "however there is usually some dominating ll @xmath18 and the amplitudes of other ll rapidly decrease with an increase of @xmath19 .",
    "our analysis qualitatively confirm the conclusions of @xcite and reveal the transitions between the fflo states with different dominating @xmath18 .",
    "the obtained results demonstrate that the fflo state , depending on superconductor parameters and/or magnetic field orientation , may take the form of the higher lls with or without a modulation along the magnetic field .",
    "the transitions betwen these states result in a very rich dependence of the transition temperature on the magnetic field orientation .",
    "( section  [ sec:3 ] ) the approach of section  [ sec:2 ] based on mgl is adequate near the tcp .",
    "on the other hand the case of anisotropic superconductors with elliptic fermi surface may be treated exactly at all temperatures . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we use the scaling transformation @xcite to obtain the solutions for the higher lls . as an illustration we consider quasi-1d and quasi-2d superconductors . note that the higher lls in quasi-2d superconductors with the in - plane orientation of the magnetic field were studied by shimahara @xcite .",
    "( section  [ sec:4 ] ) the experiments on cecoin@xmath20 show that at low temperature the superconducting transition becomes of the first order @xcite . in section  [ sec:4 ]",
    "we argue that this may be explained by the magnetism associated with cerium cites and its interaction with the superconducting subsystem . in the framework of the proposed model in the mixed state",
    "the cerium polarization should strongly increase in the cores of vortices .",
    "this mechanism could contribute to the anomalously large form factor of the vortex structure observed in cecoin@xmath0 at low temperature @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in this section we provide a general numerical approach for the calculation of the upper critical field of the fflo state . keeping in mind cecoin@xmath20 we will consider the case of the tetragonal symmetry .",
    "usual gl functional contains only the first derivatives of the order parameter and therefore it may be transformed by simple scaling transformation of the coordinates to the isotropic form ( with the corresponding renormalization of the magnetic field ) .",
    "that is why in the framework of the gl approach we may easily obtain the exact solution of the @xmath21 problem for any anisotropic superconductor - the order parameter is decribed by the n=0 ll function @xcite .",
    "it is possible to decribe the fflo state near the tcp point by mgl which takes into accound the higher derivatives of the order parameter .",
    "in contrast to the gl functional the mgl functional can not be reduced to the isotropic case by scaling the coordinates ( this is possible only for s - wave superconductivity with an elliptic fermi surface @xcite ) .",
    "therefore in the most general case , after performing the scaling transformation which makes the part with the first derivatives isotropic , we have the following modified ginzburg - landau functional : @xmath22 with @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the transition temperature into the uniform superconducting state .",
    "the differential operator has the general expression @xmath25where @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 is the flux quantum , and the anti - commutator @xmath29 . here",
    "the @xmath30 axis is perpendicular to the basal plane . to simplify the discussion , we assume that the effective mass is isotropic ( taking account of its anisotropy is detailed in appendix ) . for",
    "the appearance of the fflo state @xmath31 must be positive .",
    "the coefficients @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 describe the deviation of the actual fermi surface from the elliptic one and/or  the pairing different from s - wave type .",
    "in contrast with previous work @xcite they are not assumed to be small .",
    "the transition temperature is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the smallest eigenvalue of the operator @xmath37 .",
    "within the coordinate frame @xmath38 with the @xmath39 axis pointing in the direction of the field , the eigenfunctions of @xmath37 can be looked for in the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the fflo modulation vector along the field direction . in the abscence of anisotropic fourth - order terms",
    ", @xmath42 can be found exactly .",
    "it is one of the landau levels @xmath43 defined in the @xmath44 plane .",
    "the eigenvalues are then @xmath45   \\label{eq : lambda_iso}\\]]where @xmath46 is a positive integer , the magnetic length @xmath47and the modulation vector @xmath48 in this case , @xmath49 with a degeneracy of solutions @xmath50 which is lifted when anisotropy is present . in the general case ,",
    "we diagonalize @xmath37 in the subspace of functions @xmath51 ( see details in appendix ) in order to find the smallest eigenvalue @xmath52 which is then minimized with respect to @xmath41 to get @xmath36 .",
    "a previous work  @xcite showed that due to the effect of anisotropy three different types of solution for the fflo state can be realized : ( a ) the maximum modulation occurs along the magnetic field with the zero landau level state , ( b ) both modulation and higher landau level state , ( c ) the highest possible landau level and no modulation along the field ( or a modulation with a very small wave - vector ) .",
    "moreover due to the specific form of the fermi surface a variation of magnetic field orientation may provoke transitions between states with different landau levels .",
    "however a single - level approximation was used to get analytical results for these solutions . due to this approximation",
    "the analytical results were valid for magnetic field higher than @xmath53 . in the present work",
    "we show using numerical calculations that taking into consideration the full set of landau levels , the results qualitatively remain true for arbitrary values of the magnetic field @xmath54 .",
    "we calculate the transition temperature and the corresponding fflo state when the magnetic field is applied in the @xmath55 plane .",
    "typical results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle - a ] where we have set @xmath56 .",
    "the form of the fflo solution depends only on the parameter ratios @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( see e.g. expression  ( [ eq : lmn ] ) of the operator @xmath37 in the basis of ll ) . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle - a](a ) , the fflo state can appear with the maximum modulation vector @xmath59 and the @xmath60 ll when the field is along the @xmath30 axis .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath54 along the @xmath61 axis , there is no longitudinal modulation and the solution is composed by higher ll , which results in transverse modulations of the order parameter .",
    "when the field is rotated from one axis to the other , the state is transformed with a continuous variation of the fflo modulation and a smooth evolution of its expansion over the ll .",
    "however for smaller values of @xmath62 or @xmath57 the variation with the field orientation can be discontinuous with jumps of the fflo modulation vector ( see figs .  [ fig : angle - a](b ) and [ fig : angle - a](c ) ) .",
    "the sharp transitions are manifested by bumps and kinks in the angle dependence of the transition temperature .",
    "[ fig : angle - b](a ) shows that , for other anisotropy parameters , the jump can occur between states separated by more than one ll . as expected from the condition of single - level approximation @xmath63 or equivalently @xmath64 , the number of ll that contribute significantly in the expansion of the fflo state increases with the inverse of the field and/or the anisotropy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ll_exp ] ) .",
    "the broadening of the expansion over the ll ends up in supressing the discontinuities .",
    "in addition , as illustrated in figs .  [",
    "fig : angle - b](b ) and  [ fig : angle - b](c ) , the fflo modulation and the transition temperature can vary non - monotonuously with the field angle .",
    "it is interesting to note that at the angles when the average ll is maximum the wave - vector of modulation is minimal ( and vice versa ) and it can even drop to zero ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : angle - b](c ) ) . at these regions",
    "the fflo state corresponds to the highest ll states only .",
    "the experimental observation of such a non - trivial angular dependence of @xmath65 would be a strong evidence of the fflo state .",
    "in this section we demonstrate how the higher lls naturally appear in the exactly solvable model of the fflo transition in a framework of anisotropic effective mass model . as it has been already noted in the case of the pure paramagnetic limit this model",
    "is reduced by a scaling transformation to the isotropic one with an arbitrary direction of the fflo modulation @xcite . in the presence of the orbital effect",
    "the situation is different and we consider here the uniaxial anisotropy ( note that our results are readily generalized to the arbitrary anisotropy case ) .",
    "we are interested by a part of the hamiltonian depending on the magnetic field @xmath66 + @xmath67 with    @xmath68    @xmath69    where we consider the effective mass @xmath70 and the magnetic field @xmath71 is in the @xmath55 plane making an angle @xmath72 with the @xmath30 axis .",
    "our treatment can be readily generalized to the case of an anisotropic @xmath73 factor @xcite .",
    "the gauge of the vector potential @xmath74 is chosen as  @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 and the spin quantization axis is along the magnetic field .    performing the scaling transformation @xmath78 the orbital part becomes @xcite @xmath79 i.e. it corresponds to the isotropic metal with an effective mass @xmath80 at the orbital magnetic field @xmath81  (  @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) . the pauli contribution may be written as @xmath84 with the angular dependent effective bohr magneton @xmath85    in fact we have reduced the problem of the fflo critical field calculation to that of the isotropic model with the field @xmath86 and the effective bohr magneton @xmath87 the corresponding maki parameter is @xmath88 with , in our case , @xmath8 that is determined by the effective mass @xmath89 and then is the pure orbital field along the @xmath30 axis , while @xmath90 .",
    "so the maki parameter becomes angular dependent @xmath91 remarkably in the later expression for @xmath92 enters only the slope of @xmath21 at the same angle @xmath93 . as it was demonstrated in @xcite for large values of the maki parameter , @xmath94 , the critical fflo field at low temperature",
    "is determined by higher lls . in the case of a large quasi-2d anisotropy @xmath95 this situation",
    "is realized when the maki parameter is strongly increased for a field orientation near the @xmath96 plane . on the contrary for the quasi-1d anisotropy",
    "@xmath97 the maki parameter is maximum for the field orientated along the @xmath30 axis .",
    "the critical field may be numerically calculated from the formula @xcite @xmath98\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the ( zero field ) critical temperature , @xmath100 are the matsubara frequencies , @xmath101 are laguerre polynomials , and @xmath102 the ll number @xmath103 and the dimensionless vector of the fflo modulation @xmath104 are chosen in a way to give the maximum critical field @xmath105 .",
    "the calculated values of the upper critical field at @xmath11 @xmath106 as a function of the critical field slope at @xmath107  are presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : iii-1 ] .",
    "the lls with @xmath108 appear at @xmath109 .",
    "we see that with an increase of the slope the landau level number @xmath46 increases , while the fflo modulation vector drops . for some slopes",
    "it occurs to be zero , and then the fflo state is purely higher lls . in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : iii-1 ] we observe the non - monotonous behavior of the upper critical field as a function of the slope ( or the anisotropy @xmath110 ) . with the increase of the slope the orbital effect",
    "is switched off and we approach the pure paramagnetic limit for the 3d case . however at @xmath11 @xmath106 the transition into fflo state is a first order transition @xcite and then the calculated upper critical field should be the overcooling field of the normal phase .",
    "large values of the maki parameter suitable for the observation of these higher lls states are mainly expected in strongly ( quasi 2d or quasi 1d ) anisotropic systems . in such systems ,",
    "the formation of the higher lls may be clearly observed on the angular dependence of the critical field , which will reproduce the dependence on the initial slope displayed on fig .",
    "[ fig : iii-1 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : iii-2 ] , such an angular dependence is presented for a maximum slope @xmath111 with a ratio of effective masses @xmath112 , below the threshold of higher lls formation .",
    "we see in fig .  [",
    "fig : iii-2 ] the standard behaviour inherent to the anisotropic mass model .",
    "the situation is very different in fig .",
    "[ fig : iii-3 ] , where the slope @xmath113 is well above the threshold . at low temperature",
    "the angular dependence @xmath114 clearly reveals the transition between the higher lls , making the overall shape of the @xmath114 curve very peculiar , and somewhat similar to the corresponding results of section ii .    note that in isotropic systems the fflo modulation vector @xmath115 is directed along the applied magnetic field . in anisotropic superconductor",
    "the fflo modulation is described by @xmath116 @xmath117 , that is @xmath118 .",
    "therefore the angle @xmath119 that the direction of the fflo modulation makes with the @xmath30 axis is given by @xmath120 .",
    "this means that for quasi-2d anisotropy the fflo modulation vector deviates from the field direction toward the @xmath30 axis , while for the quasi-1d anisotropy it lies closer to the @xmath96 plane .",
    "the appearence of the higher lls in quasi-2d superconductors when the magnetic field direction approach the @xmath96 plane is consistent with the prediction of such states in 2d superconductors in tilted magnetic field @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "in a magnetic field the superconducting transition in cecoin@xmath0 becomes slightly first order below @xmath121 for the field along the tetragonal @xmath30 axis and below @xmath122 for the field in the @xmath96 basal plane @xcite .",
    "the change of the transition order occurs at a magnetic field lower than that of the presumed fflo transition .",
    "another particularity of this compound is the field induced antiferromagnetic transition when the magnetic field is in the basal plane @xcite .",
    "this antiferromagnetic phase exists only in the mixed state and basically in the same region , where the fflo state is expected .",
    "neutron scattering experiments @xcite reveal a small value of the magnetic moment on cerium sites @xmath123 oriented along the tetragonal axis .",
    "we may expect that the normal state of cecoin@xmath0 is very close to the magnetic instability of the itinerant type . indeed  the measurements of the magnetic susceptibility reveal its strong temperature increase at low temperature ( at several @xmath106 ) @xcite .",
    "we propose to consider cecoin@xmath0 as a system with two type of electrons , one mostly localized on cerium sites and responsible for the magnetism and the second strongly delocalized and responsible for superconducting properties .",
    "in fact a multiband picture for cecoin@xmath0 was already discussed by several authors ",
    "see for example  @xcite .    in a magnetic field",
    "the electrons from the ce band , which are polarized due to the exchange interaction , will create , in addition to zeeman field , some internal field acting on the spins of the superconducting electrons .",
    "we may describe this situation by a simple ginzburg - landau functional introducing , in addition to the superconducting order parameter , the magnetic moment @xmath124 of ce sub - band : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the paramagnetic critical field and @xmath127 describes the contribution of the orbital effect .",
    "the constant @xmath128 describes the contribution of polarized ce band electrons to the field acting on the spin of the superconducting electrons . minimizing ( [ f(m ) ] ) over @xmath124",
    "we find @xmath129 and finally substituting this expression into ( [ f(m ) ] ) we obtain the pure superconducting functional @xmath130    here the role of the ce band magnetization is the renormalization of the zeeman field @xmath131 and the shift of coefficient @xmath132 of the @xmath133 term @xmath134 whatever sign of the exchange interaction @xmath135 , it decreases the coefficient of the @xmath133 term . with an increase of polarization at the normal state @xmath136",
    ", it may even become negative .",
    "this means that the superconducting transition becomes first order .",
    "we believe that namely such a situation is realized in cecoin@xmath0 at low temperature , explaining the observed first order transition below @xmath137 .",
    "moreover the contribution to the magnetization from the ce band ( [ m(h ) ] ) depends on the profile of the superconducting order parameter . in the vortex state",
    "the maxima of the magnetization would be at the vortex core , where the superconducting order parameter vanishes .",
    "this circumstance may strongly increase the amplitude of the magnetic field modulation and then explain the anomalous behavior of the form factor of the vortex structure observed in cecoin@xmath0 at low temperature @xcite .",
    "previously ichioka and machida @xcite performed an extensive numerical analysis of the role of the pauli paramagnetic effect in the context of quasi - classical eilenberger theory .",
    "they demonstrated the modulation of electron spin susceptibility in the mixed state , increasing the electron magnetization in the vortex core and thus they have explained the anomalous behaviour of the form factor . in the recent paper @xcite , a similar problem has been treated by a variational method .",
    "note that in these theories , only one electron band is implied , and therefore it is difficult to explain the occurrence of the first order superconducting transition . in some sense ,",
    "our model provides an additional mechanism for the increase of the contrast of the magnetic field modulation .",
    "if we consider that the ce band magnetism contributes to the temperature dependent susceptibility , while the band responsible for superconductivity gives the temperature independent contribution , then from the experimental data @xcite we may roughly estimate that they are equally involved at low temperature ( @xmath138",
    "in real compounds , the crystal structure plays a dominant role in determining the type of fflo state . of course it will also influence the vortex structure .",
    "the fflo state may be characterised by an uni - dimensional modulation of the order parameter , and/or by the emergence of higher landau level states .",
    "this is a crucial difference with superconductivity without fflo state , where the crystal structure influence only on the type of the abrikosov vortex lattice .",
    "the higher landau level fflo states should be realized in systems with strong uni - axial anisotropy and near in - plane orientation of the magnetic field . in such a case , the higher ll states should lead to an unusual angular dependence of @xmath21 .",
    "finally we propose a simple explanation of the first order transition at low temperature in cecoin@xmath0 based on the ce - band magnetic contribution .",
    "in the paramagnetic limit the mgl functional quadratic over @xmath139 is @xmath140 where @xmath141 , @xmath142 ( with @xmath27 ) and @xmath143 is the forth - order part of the @xmath144 expansion .",
    "the functional is invarient by the tranformations of the crystal symmetry group . in the tetragonal symmetry",

    "the angles that @xmath154 and @xmath155 have with the @xmath30-axis ( see fig .",

    "the latter term only shifts the energy by a constant so the solution for the order parameter is not modified .",
