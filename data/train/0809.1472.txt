    "all around us we see fluid drops joining together : raindrops splash into a pond and fuse with it ; individual drops falling from a faucet merge together to fill a glass of water .",
    "it is easy to forget the wonder of such a ubiquitous phenomenon .",
    "there is a change in topology when two fluids coalesce .",
    "as soon as they come into contact , a fluid bridge is formed between the two masses .",
    "the initial radius of the bridge is much smaller than the macroscopic dimensions of the flow .",
    "interfacial tension then widens it until the two drops merge into a single entity . a video sequence of this process is shown in fig .",
    "another common example of a topological transition is the inverse process to coalescence , that is , drop break up@xcite .",
    "there , a single mass of fluid separates into two segments joined by a thin neck . in that case the topological transformation proceeds as a physical dimension , the neck radius , approaches zero causing the dynamics to approach a singularity .",
    "when two drops coalesce , we expect similar singular behavior .",
    "such fluid transitions have often been compared to critical thermodynamic phase transitions , as this separation of length scales often leads to universal behavior@xcite .",
    "although it is an appealing and useful framework , it was recently discovered that not all fluid - breakup singularities obey universal dynamics @xcite . in light of this , it is imperative to consider other familiar fluid transitions , such as drop coalescence , to see if they , too , behave in unexpected ways . moreover , drop coalescence is of practical as well as purely scientific importance .",
    "viscous sintering , emulsion stability and mixing in microfluidics often need to be controlled in industrial processes . in this paper ,",
    "i employ an electrical method to explore the drop coalescence transition at low viscosities at times three orders of magnitude earlier than previous optical experiments .",

    "the frames are 69 @xmath0s apart .",
    "the white spot in the bridge center is an optical artifact due to the drop lensing the light source located behind it.,width=90 ]    coalescence processes occur in both the viscous regime , where the primary force opposing the widening of the bridge between the drops is due to viscous dissipation , and the inviscid regime , where the widening of the bridge is opposed primarily by inertial forces . in the inviscid regime studied here , the radius of the fluid bridge between the two coalescing drops , @xmath1 , is much greater than the viscous length scale of the system , @xmath2,where @xmath0 is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid , @xmath3 is its density , and @xmath4 is the surface tension . for water coalescing in air ,",
    "@xmath5 nm , and viscous effects can be neglected for much of the coalescence . this regime has been studied less than its high - viscosity counterpart@xcite because the very rapid initial motion of the low viscosity fluid is difficult to resolve in experiments and computations .",

    "a straightforward scaling argument @xcite can be used to describe coalescence in the inviscid regime . to initiate coalescence",

    ", the gap width between the two drops , @xmath6 , will satisfy @xmath7 . in this case",
    ", a balance between surface tension and inertia leads to    @xmath8    it is assumed that if the two droplets are brought together sufficiently slowly , then they will maintain a spherical shape . for hemispherical drops , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the drop radius , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . the resulting differential equation can be solved , where @xmath11 is the instant at which coalescence occurs , and c is a proportionality constant of order unity :    @xmath12    this scaling law has been supported by simulations studying the coalescence of low - viscosity fluid drops in the absence of an outer fluid@xcite . however , due to the speed and the geometry of the transition , experimental studies have been unable to confirm the applicability of this scaling law to times @xmath13 @xmath14 .",

    "however , one aspect of the data suggests that the dynamics may not behave as we would expect . in one experiment ,",
    "a small dc voltage was placed across the drops , and it was found that the initiation of electrical contact occurred @xmath18 @xmath0s before coalescence could be observed visually @xcite . an electrical method introduced by case and nagel @xcite , expands the measurement range down to @xmath19 ns , a region currently inaccessible to imaging experiments .",
    "results from this data closer to the instant of coalescence indicated a new asymptotic regime not predicted by the scaling argument given above .",
    "moreover it suggested a solution to the discrepancy found between the instant of electrical contact and the apparent initiation of coalescence .",
    "electrical methods for studying drop coalescence have been used in other experiments .",
    "the electrical method used in case and nagel s experiment is similar to one previously developed by burton et al@xcite , which used a small dc voltage to measure the resistance of a mercury droplet during break up .",
    "case and nagel extended burton et al s technique by using an ac voltage to measure separately both the time - dependent resistance and the capacitance of two coalescing drops of aqueous nacl solution .",
    "this enabled them to infer the geometry of the coalescing region as early as @xmath20 ns after the instant of coalescence .",
    "they found a new asymptotic regime at early times that is not consistent with the predictions of the simple scaling argument outlined above .",
    "this behavior occurs for @xmath21 @xmath0s so that it is entirely in the region that can not be studied by direct imaging .",
    "in addition , an ac electrical method was used by lukyanets and kavehpour to study the rest time of coalescing drops@xcite .",
    "these results ( at voltage magnitudes three orders of magnitude larger than the largest used here ) suggest that deformations resulting from high electric fields in the gap between the two drops may introduce errors in measurements . in the experiments described here ,",
    "varying the voltage and frequency by several orders of magnitude does not significantly affect the results .",
    "this is discussed further in appendix a.    in this paper , i expand upon these measurements and provide a more detailed experimental description .",

    "we find that this occurs between @xmath187 and @xmath20 @xmath0s after the initiation of coalescence , consistent with these observations .",
    "these previous experiments also postulated that coalescence occurred over a finite region of radius @xmath198 @xmath0 m . in this case , @xmath63 would increase suddenly at the instant of coalescence , contrary to our observations .",
    "there are several possible reasons for the existence of a flattened region , and i suggest two here .",
    "one possibility is that the flattening is an air effect .",
    "it has recently been shown that for drops splashing on dry surfaces , air plays a role in the dynamics of the impact@xcite .",
    "two drops approaching one another at finite velocity might trap a layer of air between them , which could have unexpected consequences .",
    "a second possibility is the presence of surfactant .",
    "although precautions were taken to avoid contamination , surfactants might still be present in small quantities .",
    "it has been seen that even a very small amount of surfactant can prevent a drop from coalescing with a flat fluid surface@xcite .",
    "the repulsion due to this could explain the observed flattening .",
    "understanding the flattening of two fluid drops as they approach each other could not only affect the many industrial applications that rely on droplet coalescence , but also could illuminate other important physical questions .",
    "the origin of the thin film rupture which triggers coalescence is an active field of research@xcite .",
    "the observable flattening of the drops could contribute to an understanding of this rupture . also , as we begin to study the topological changes that occur in microfluidics , behavior at the smallest scales and the earliest times is essential .",
    "the earliest stages of a topological transition in a fluid are when the analogy to a critical thermodynamic phase transition ought to be most accurate . as in drop break up , near the coalescence transition",
    ", the small - scale flows decouple from the large - scale flows . however , we observe that the bridge radius between the two drops scales differently depending on the overall drop shape .",
    "the geometry of the system is crucial , a situation that does not have an analog in thermodynamic phase transitions . by studying these fluid shape transitions ,",
