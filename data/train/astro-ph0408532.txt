    "after roughly three decades since the pioneering work on the massive stellar content of extragalactic regions by @xcite and @xcite , there is still space for discussions regarding the possible variation of the initial mass function ( imf ) properties at high metallicity .",
    "this question has been commonly investigated spectroscopically via the analysis of the nebular excitation produced by unresolved populations of stars , embedded in giant regions located within spiral galaxies .",
    "this method is prone to uncertainties , due to the model - dependent conclusions one can draw on the shape of the imf . despite the known presence of massive stars in the metal - rich galactic center ( see , for example , figer in this volume ) and the lack of evidence for variations of the imf between the milky way and the comparatively metal - deficient magellanic clouds ( massey et al .",
    "1995 ) , we still need to investigate the possible dependence of the massive star imf on additional factors , such as the star formation history , the stellar density , and the galactic hubble type . moreover , quantifying the chemical abundances in metal - rich star forming regions of spiral galaxies remains , perhaps somewhat surprisingly , an open issue .    in a recent review @xcite covered several aspects of the massive star imf , including the topic discussed in the current contribution .",
    "i therefore concentrate on the most recent results and on some of the current work being done on the subject .",
    "the upper end of the mass function is loosely defined here as that tail composed by stars more massive than @xmath1 , i.e.  o and b stars with effective temperatures above 25,000  k. although rare , these stars have an important feedback effect on galactic evolution , via the energy and momentum transferred to the interstellar medium by stellar winds , as well as its chemical enrichment , during their whole lifetime up to the supernova deflagration finale .",
    "the rarity and the short lifetimes ( only a few myr ) of massive stars imply that we must account for statistical effects in the random sampling of the upper imf , and that the stellar ensemble under consideration needs to be very young .    the notion that stars more massive than a certain threshold do not form at high metallicity ( approximately solar and above ) derives from early observational trends in samples of extragalactic regions , combined with the accretion theory of kahn ( 1974 ) .",
    "the radial gradients in excitation , measured from the intensity of forbidden metal lines , and in the equivalent width of the nebular h@xmath2 emission line in spiral galaxies led to the suggestion that the upper mass limit is lowered ( shields & tinsley  1976 ) and that the slope of the imf becomes steeper ( terlevich & melnick  1981 ) at large metallicity .",
    "this idea has received support even recently from further optical and infrared spectroscopy of extragalactic regions ( among others : goldader et al .",
    "1997 , bresolin et al .  1999 ,",
    "thornley et al .",
    "this interpretation relies on the observed softening of the radiation field at high metallicity , seen , for example , from the decreasing hei@xmath35876/h@xmath2 line ratio in the optical ( bresolin et al .  1999 , 2004 ) and from small fine - structure line ratios ( e.g.  [ neiii]/ne[ii ] ) in the mid - ir ( rigby & rieke  2004 ; see leitherer in this volume ) .",
    "by contrast , the uv spectral properties of regions of active star formation do not support the idea of a varying imf with metallicity .",
    "in particular , the strengths and pcygni profiles of wind resonance lines , such as civ@xmath31550 and siiv@xmath31400 , in supposedly metal - rich starbursts can be modeled with a ` normal ' salpeter - slope imf extending up to 100  @xmath0 ( gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "an additional direct probe for the presence of massive stars , the wolf - rayet ( w - r ) emission feature at 4660 , has been used to infer the extension of the imf to large masses ( @xmath43040  @xmath0 ) even at the highest metallicities sampled ( schaerer et al .",
    "2000 , bresolin & kennicutt  2002 , pindao et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the dichotomy in the imf properties derived from _ indirect _",
    "( analysis of nebular lines ) and _ direct _ ( uv lines , w - r features ) investigation methods seems now to be , at least in part , the result of the inadequacy of the stellar atmosphere models used in the past for the calculation of the ionizing flux output by hot and massive stars . as shown by gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and rigby & rieke  ( 2004 ) , the adoption of recent non - lte stellar atmospheres , which include the effects of line - driven winds and line blocking from metals , into the evolutionary population synthesis models used for the interpretation of the spectra , leads to more standard conclusions regarding the upper imf at high metallicity .",
    "in addition , complications arising from the effects of the nebular geometry and density structure of regions conjure to make the determination of imf parameters from nebular lines alone uncertain at best .",
    "the determination of chemical compositions is a topic where nebular lines _ do _ provide an essential insight into the physical and evolutionary status of star - forming galaxies .",
    "most of our knowledge of radial abundance gradients in spiral galaxies derives , in fact , from the analysis of forbidden lines in regions .",
    "the presence of chemical abundance gradients in spiral galaxies is well - established , but recent extragalactic nebular abundance work is questioning the high end of the metallicity scale of previous investigations .",
    "only recently the faint auroral lines used to determine direct electron temperatures of the nebular gas have become observable at high metallicity , where such lines become extremely faint , requiring large - aperture telescopes for their detection . in the case of m101 , arguably the spiral galaxy with the best determination of an abundance gradient , kennicutt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found a reduction of the central abundance by up to a factor of two with respect to indirect methods relying on strong emission lines ( the r@xmath5 indicator of pagel et al .",
    "1979 ) . in the metal - rich spiral m51 , the measurement of the auroral lines [ nii]@xmath35755 and [ siii]@xmath36312 from keck lris spectra by bresolin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in a significant number of regions led to the determination of an extrapolated central abundance @xmath6(o / h ) = @xmath7 , a roughly solar value , and a factor up to 2 - 3 times lower than indicated by previous investigations .",
    "figure  1 shows how different calibrations of the r@xmath5 indicator exceed the abundance inferred from the electron temperatures , believed to represent the correct value .",
    "this and similar results indicate that the term ` high metallicity ' needs to be somewhat revisited when referring to extragalactic regions .",
    "nebulae that in the past were considered to be of highly supersolar abundance , are very likely to be in the solar abundance regime , perhaps up to 50% higher in the most extreme cases .",
    "the results mentioned earlier concerning the massive imf in our own galaxy and the lack of evidence for observable differences in the metallicity range bracketed by the small magellanic cloud and the milky way might then imply that no variation in the upper mass limit is to be expected in the majority of putative metal - rich star forming galaxies .",
    "we might still have to find an region with 23 times the solar oxygen abundance .",
    "the detection and measurement of w - r features ( e.g.  the 4660 ` bump ' ) in the spectra of extragalactic regions at high metallicity , such as in the nucleus of the spiral galaxy m83 ( bresolin & kennicutt  2002 ) , offers a powerful method to constrain the upper mass cutoff of star - forming regions .",
    "this was elegantly shown by pindao et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who estimated the _ minimum _ mass of the most massive stars from model predictions of the equivalent width of the h@xmath2 emission line , an evolutionary chronometer for the ionizing stellar clusters , at the beginning of the w - r phase .",
    "we have recently obtained vlt spectra with the purpose of analyzing the nebular properties , as well as the massive stellar ( w - r ) content , of a sample of extragalactic regions contained in metal - rich galaxies ( schaerer , bresolin , gonzlez delgado & stasiska , in preparation ) .",
    "some preliminary results are displayed in fig .  2 , where i consider some of our new observational data about regions containing w - r features in ngc  1232 , m83 and m51 ( dark - grey circles ) , where the metallicity is confirmed from electron temperature measurements to be about solar , or slightly above that , together with the data compiled by pindao et al .",
    "( 2002 , squares and triangles ) , and the other vlt targets for which our analysis is still incomplete ( remaining light - grey symbols ) . under the minimal assumption that in these objects the w - r phase just started ( which corresponds to a maximum h@xmath2 equivalent width ) , the evolutionary models of schaerer & vacca ( 1998 ) tell us that the imf in these regions extends up to at least 6070  @xmath0 , for a salpeter - slope imf .",
    "if the abundance analysis of the remaining objects will confirm their high metallicity , which is currently just inferred from strong - line methods , we could push the minimum mass of the upper mass limit to even higher values , in agreement with the findings at lower metallicities ."
