    "after more than a decade of the domination of high-@xmath2 compounds in superconductivity research , the interest for conventional type ii superconductors has recently been renewed .",
    "this trend is related to the necessity of a better understanding of vortex - motion phenomena rather than to improving the pinning in materials for high - current applications , since the complexity of the mixed state of high-@xmath2 superconductors has prevented a deeper insight into basic principles of vortex transport .",
    "a number of classical , low-@xmath2 alloys can nowadays be fabricated in the form of homogeneous thin films of highly reproducible superconducting properties and , furthermore , can be shaped using standard methods for sample structuring - such as electron - beam lithography .",
    "some of these systems , for example amorphous nb@xmath3ge@xmath4 , have a very weak pinning over a large portion of the magnetic field ( @xmath5 ) vs temperature ( @xmath6 ) plane @xcite , being hence suitable for studies on fundamental , pinning - independent properties of vortex dynamics . in turn , with such samples one can combine a simple vortex matter ( characteristic of classical superconductors ) , an extended @xmath7 range of weak or negligible pinning ( a property of high-@xmath2 materials ) and artificially - introduced elements for influencing vortex motion locally .",
    "our recent investigation of vortex transport in amorphous nb@xmath0ge@xmath1 microbridges @xcite has utilised the above - outlined advantageous properties of this material .",
    "we have obtained a quantitative understanding of several mechanisms related to vortex dynamics in general , which has been used to deal with some aspects of the role of small ( of the order of the magnetic - field penetration depth @xmath8 ) perforating holes on the vortex - motion dissipation . in this work",
    "we concentrate on the dissipation in the presence of holes when the induced electric field is thus strong that vortex cores suffer substantial changes .",
    "more precisely , we refer to the strongly nonequilibrium regime of vortex motion , the appearance of which is preceded by nonlinear voltage - current characteristics of an origin different from depinning phenomena .",
    "the physics underlying these nonlinearities is either vortex - core shrinking close to @xmath2 , proposed theoretically by larkin and ovchinnikov ( lo ) @xcite , or vortex - core expansion due to electron heating above the bath temperature @xcite , depending on the experimental conditions .",
    "the above effect has been identified experimentally in a number of superconductors ranging from simple metals ( al , sn , in ) @xcite to high-@xmath2 materials @xcite , including amorphous nb@xmath3ge@xmath4 @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "the modification of the dissipation in this regime by perforating holes has so far not been investigated , presumably because both the nature of the strongly nonequilibrium state and the effects of holes on vortex transport in the weak nonequilibrium were until recently not well understood .",
    "having these topics analysed in refs.@xcite and @xcite , respectively , we now have a basis for turning to the present subject .",
    "curves of sample n ( solid lines ) and sample p ( dashed lines ) for three bath temperatures @xmath9 and the corresponding @xmath10 , as indicated , and for @xmath11",
    ". regimes i and iii correspond to the weak and strong nonequilbrium , respectively , with regime ii in between .",
    "the dotted line represents the normal - state electric field @xmath12.,width=283 ]    the main features of the overall dissipation can be seen in the electric field vs current density characteristics @xmath13 in fig.1 , discussed in more detail later , where the results for three characteristic reduced temperatures @xmath14 are shown ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "here @xmath9 denotes the bath temperature , which is assumed to coincide with the phonon temperature .",
    "the reduced magnetic field @xmath16 is @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the equilibrium upper critical magnetic field ) , and the solid and dashed lines represent the @xmath13 of a nonperforated ( sample n ) and a perforated ( sample p ) microbridge , respectively .",
    "there are three dynamic regimes , denoted by i , ii and iii , related to the specific properties of moving vortex cores .",
    "regime i corresponds to the _ weak nonequilibrium _ ( wn ) , where vortex cores maintain the static properties , i.e. their radius",
    "is set by the equilibrium coherence length @xmath19 . as shown in ref.@xcite , in this case",
    "the presence of holes results in : ( a ) an increase of the dissipation close to @xmath2 due to a local modulation of the current density around the holes ; ( b ) , ( c ) a reduction of the dissipation arising from flux pinning by the holes , which is stronger as @xmath9 is lower . in regime iii , @xmath20 is not much smaller than the normal - state electric field @xmath12 , where @xmath21 is the normal - state resistivity , which signifies dramatic changes in vortex cores .",
    "this is the regime of the _ strong nonequilibrium _",
    "( sn ) , the physics of which is discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we shall return to this regime later , but at this point we note that , at all three characteristic temperatures , for sufficiently high @xmath22 the holes invariably _ enhance _ the dissipation - in contrast to regime i , and this is the central topic of this article .",
    "the intermediate regime ii is at low @xmath23 manifested by the presented steep jump - called flux - flow instability ( ffi ) , whereas at higher @xmath23 this transition is smooth .",
    "in this section we briefly summarise the results of refs.@xcite and @xcite , which are required for addressing the sn vortex transport in the presence of perforating holes .",
    "( arrowed dashed lines ) around the holes and the vortex trajectories ( arrowed solid lines ) without pinning by the holes .",
    "( c ) the change of the vortex trajectories when the holes pin vortices , thus exerting a repulsive force ( radially - pointing arrowed dotted lines ) upon the other vortices.,width=245 ]    the vortex - motion dissipation has been studied by measurements of the _ dc _ @xmath13 of two microbridges ( samples n and p ) between large contact pads , deposited simultaneously onto an oxidised si substrate through the masks prepared by electron - beam lithography .",
    "both microbridges are @xmath24 @xmath25 m long , @xmath26 @xmath25 m wide and @xmath27 nm thick .",
    "while sample n is a plain microbridge , sample p is perforated with a line of equidistant holes 800 nm in diameter , with the centre - to - centre separation of 1.2 @xmath25 m , as sketched in fig.2(a ) .",
    "an applied magnetic field @xmath28 is oriented perpendicularly to the film plane , a transport current is passed along the bridge ( in the @xmath29 direction ) , vortices traverse the sample in the @xmath30 direction , thus the measured @xmath20 is in the @xmath29 direction . both samples have the same @xmath31 k , the ginzburg - landau parameters are @xmath32 nm and @xmath33 @xmath25 m , and @xmath34 @xmath35 m ( in the temperature range of interest changes at the level of 0.01 % ) .",
    "clearly , in sample p the current density is spatially modulated around the holes , hence if we want to compare its @xmath13 with that for sample n we have to find the ratio of the _ average _ current density @xmath36 in sample p and the uniform current density @xmath37 in sample n. this has been done by comparing the resistances above @xmath2 , which match perfectly if @xmath38 .",
    "using this relationship we can calculate and compare @xmath39 and @xmath40 for samples n and p , respectively , and use this notation when referring to to the @xmath13 of the two samples specifically . @xmath41 and",
    "@xmath40 were measured at constant @xmath5 and @xmath6 by sweeping the applied current up at a rate of 10 na / s , which was slow enough to avoid any detectable dependence of @xmath20 on the sweep rate .      in the wn regime ,",
    "vortex cores preserve their static properties and vortex transport corresponds to a lorentz - force - induced motion of normal cylinders of a radius @xmath42 , each carrying a quantum @xmath43 of the magnetic flux .",
    "this force is opposed by a viscous damping @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the viscosity coefficient and @xmath46 the vortex velocity , and by the pinning force @xmath47 ( if present ) .",
    "the equation of motion for vortices created by a magnetic field @xmath48 , @xmath49 , is ( per unit vortex length ) @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the driving force , @xmath52 the effective vortex mass @xcite , and the @xmath53th component of the vortex acceleration is given by @xmath54 . if @xmath55 is uniform and if there are no other forces on vortices , the left - hand side of the above equation equals zero and we obtain the well - known equation of vortex motion in homogeneous superconductors .",
    "the electric field induced by vortex motion is @xmath56 $ ] , where @xmath57 is the vortex density .",
    "again , for uniform @xmath46 the coordinate dependences in the above expressions can be omitted .",
    "the simplest case is @xmath58 , which is in our samples satisfied close to @xmath2 ( typically , for @xmath59 ) over most of the range @xmath60 , when the dissipation for uniform @xmath46 ( sample n ) agrees very well with the lo theory @xcite of ohmic flux - flow resistivity @xmath61 .    in the presence of holes the current density is spatially modulated in their vicinity ( figs.2(b ) and 2(c ) , arrowed dashed lines ) , which leads to a nonuniform @xmath62 and the relevance of the term @xmath63 . as discussed in detail in ref.@xcite , with @xmath58 and no pinning by the holes the modulation of @xmath55 causes a chanelling of the vortex trajectories through the holes ( fig.2(b ) , arrowed solid lines ) and an enhancement of the measured dissipation ( fig.1(a ) , regime i ) .    with decreasing @xmath9 the pinning strength of the holes increases , which introduces an additional term on the right - hand side of the equation of motion , i.e. a repulsion of the vortices pinned by the holes and the other vortices [ as sketched by the arrowed dotted lines in fig.2(c ) ] .",
    "this changes the vortex trajectories as indicated , and results in a reduction of the dissipation [ regime i in figs.1(b ) and 1(c ) ] , an effect that is stronger as @xmath9 is lower .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the results outlined above address the influence of a single hole on vortex transport more directly than those referring to two - dimensional arrays of holes in samples with stronger intrinsic pinning than in nb@xmath0ge@xmath1 . in these experiments",
    "the main effects arise from an interplay of the material pinning in the interstitial area and the matching effects between the vortex lattice and the regular array , see e.g. ref.@xcite , which can even disappear below @xmath64 .",
    "the nature of the regime denoted by iii in fig.1 was until recently not completely understood .",
    "lo predicted a jump in @xmath13 , i.e. ffi , as a consequence of a decrease of @xmath45 caused by a shrinking of vortex cores according to @xmath65 $ ] , where @xmath66 is a characteristic electric field corresponding to a vortex velocity @xmath67 .",
    "the existence of the ffi has been verified in a number of experiments , but most of these have relied on simply identifying @xmath68 from the position of the jump , without addressing the regime @xmath69 in detail .",
    "furthermore , the lo mechanism turned out to be viable only close to @xmath2 , failing to account for the sn state at low @xmath9 .",
    "a quantitative treatment of @xmath13 in ref.@xcite showed that close to @xmath2 the lo vortex - core shrinking was a valid mechanism up to at least @xmath70 , which was considerably higher than the theoretical prediction of bezuglyj and shklovskij @xcite , who estimated that heating effects should be significant above @xmath71 .",
    "for the present discussion it is important that the lo description holds for @xmath41 in regime iii at @xmath72 over the entire range of measurement and analysis ( @xmath73 ) .    far below @xmath2",
    "neither the ffi nor the sn @xmath13 can be described by the lo approach .",
    "the low-@xmath9 ffi was addressed by kunchur @xcite , who assumed that the nonlinearities in @xmath13 originated in heating of electrons to a temperature @xmath74 .",
    "this hypothesis sets @xmath75 rather than @xmath9 as the relevant temperature for superconducting parameters , which results in an expansion of vortex cores , according to @xmath76 , and a consequent decrease of the @xmath18 .",
    "the same idea was used in ref.@xcite to quantitatively describe the sn @xmath13 ( regime iii ) by a replacement @xmath77 .",
    "this analysis also led to identifying a nonequilibrium phase boundary @xmath78 as an electric field at which the heating destroyed the superconductivity .",
    "hence , the generic properties of the sn flux flow in our samples are understood sufficiently well to discuss the modifications introduced by the holes .",
    "we first consider the results for @xmath9 close to @xmath2 , a representative of which is shown in fig.1(a ) .",
    "this and the other results of this section refer to @xmath79 k , i.e. @xmath72 , where @xmath41 ( measured for @xmath73 , with @xmath80 t ) agrees remarkably well with the lo model of flux flow @xcite for all three regimes i , ii and iii .",
    "more precisely , a single theoretical curve , which in the limit @xmath81 reduces to ohmic @xmath82 , describes the entire @xmath41 .",
    "noteworthy , for these data we have found no signature of intrinsic pinning , i.e. in the limit @xmath83 the results agree well with the theoretical @xmath61 calculated for depinned vortices .",
    "the reader may consult ref.@xcite for details of the comparison of the experiment and theory , whereas here we recall the main results only .",
    "the nonlinearities of @xmath41 are in a one - to - one correspondence to the shrinking of vortex cores mentioned in section [ nature ] . the characteristic electric field",
    "@xmath68 has been found to be linear with @xmath5 , as predicted by lo , from which we have extracted the characteristic vortex velocity @xmath84 m / s . when @xmath85 exceeds @xmath67 considerably , the shrinking stops at @xmath86 , which defines sn vortex radius .",
    "in our case ( @xmath72 ) , @xmath87 and the sn flux flow refers to vortices of approximately three times smaller area than in equilibrium .",
    "therefore , in regimes i and iii the vortex radii are essentially independent of @xmath85 , being @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively , while in regime ii they depend on @xmath85 strongly @xcite .",
    "the current - density modulation around the holes , sketched in figs.2(b ) and 2(c ) , in the wn ( regime i ) causes an increase of the dissipation in comparison to that with no holes @xcite .",
    "the vortices follow the trajectories depicted in fig.2(b ) , which is possible because the flux pinning by the holes is weak due to the large @xmath8 close to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the vortex velocity obviously varies in space , i.e. it is larger in the regions of larger @xmath22 , and the net result is @xmath90 .",
    "we see in fig.1(a ) that this behaviour continues in regimes ii and iii .",
    "hence , close to @xmath2 the current modulation around the holes always enhances the dissipation , irrespectively of the particular dynamic radius of vortex cores . in region",
    "iii the situation is simpler than in region ii , because in this case the vortices have already shrunk to their minimum size - which is therefore constant over the entire sample . on the other hand , in regime ii",
    "the vortex - core size varies considerably with @xmath85 and consequently depends on the vortex position .",
    "( open circles ) and @xmath40 ( solid circles ) in the strongly nonequilbrium state ( regime iii ) at @xmath79 k ( @xmath72 ) and @xmath91 .",
    "the solid line represents @xmath92 with @xmath93 .",
    "inset : a plot of @xmath94 against @xmath95 , showing that the values of @xmath94 extrapolate to unity in the limit @xmath96 , as indicated by the dashed line.,width=283 ]    the dissipation enhancement in regime iii can be approached quantitatively . if the modulation of @xmath22 is the main cause of @xmath90 for vortices of a radius @xmath89 , thein it should be possible to obtain @xmath97 with @xmath98 being a constant over a range of @xmath22 .",
    "this is the case indeed , as demonstrated in fig.3 for @xmath91 where the agreement for @xmath99 ma / m@xmath100 is remarkable . @xmath41 and @xmath40 are represented by the open and solid circles , respectively , while the solid line is @xmath101 plotted using @xmath93 . although the differences are small - around 1 % , they are of the order of 1 mv and are thus reliably observable .",
    "this procedure can be carried out for all the @xmath13 to extract the @xmath23 dependence of @xmath94 .",
    "the result is shown in the inset to fig.3 , where @xmath94 is plotted against @xmath95 .",
    "obviously , the values of @xmath94 extrapolate to unity for @xmath96 , thus satisfying the condition that the two dissipations must be the same in the normal state .    a quantitative treatment of regime ii would require a detailed numerical modelling , which is outside the scope of this paper , thus we restrict ourselves to qualitative considerations .",
    "besides the observed @xmath90 , another feature is discernible : regime ii is for sample n always narrower ( and the ffi , if present , sharper ) , which complies with the picture of locally - dependent vortex velocity in sample p. namely , in this case the measured @xmath20 corresponds to an integration over a distribution of @xmath102 , resulting in a broader range of the strong nonlinearity , here denoted as regime ii .    in conclusion to section [ close ] , our results and analysis suggest that the current - density modulation around perforating holes of a diameter @xmath103 may increase the dissipation irrespectively of the dynamic properties of vortex cores .",
    "this can occur provided the hole pinning is sufficiently weak , i.e. in conditions of a large @xmath104 .",
    "the sn dissipation enhancement by the holes can be described by a @xmath23-dependent factor @xmath105 . by implication , the system remains in thermal equilibrium at @xmath9 , and the increase of @xmath20 around the holes is solely a consequence of the modulation of @xmath22 .",
    "as already mentioned in section [ holeq ] , perforating holes pin equilibrium vortices most efficiently if @xmath8 is of the order or of the hole diameter , as calculated theoretically @xcite and demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "therefore , the weak pinning by the holes close to @xmath2 is a consequence of the large @xmath104 , and , as shown in section [ close ] , the same holds for vortices which undergo the lo core shrinking .    in the wn at low @xmath9",
    "the holes are efficient pinning centres , which can be understood in terms of a smaller @xmath106 , leading to a suppression of the dissipation @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is seen in figs.1(b ) and 1(c ) ( regime i ) , where the dissipation suppression is stronger as @xmath9 is lower and @xmath8 consequently smaller . as argued in ref.@xcite",
    ", the reason for the dissipation reduction is not only in some vortices being immobilised by the holes but also in changing the vortex trajectories as depicted in fig.2(c ) , so that the mobile vortices pass through the regions of smaller current density , between the holes .",
    "the vortex trajectories change because the vortices pinned by the holes repel the mobile vortices , as sketched by the arrowed dotted lines in fig.2(c ) .",
    "the net reduction of the dissipation - _ originating from the both effects mentioned above _ , decreases monotonically with @xmath23 .",
    "more precisely , this behaviour is described quantitatively by a ratio @xmath107 of the power density @xmath108 dissipated in samples p and n ( as denoted by the subscripts @xmath109 ) in regime i. for the @xmath13 measured at @xmath110 k , @xmath111 increases from @xmath112 at @xmath113 to @xmath114 at @xmath115 .",
    "the same effect appears for @xmath116 k as well , but in this case @xmath117 already around @xmath118 .",

    "v / m there is a crossover from @xmath122 , characteristic of regimes i and ii , to @xmath123 .",
    "inset : the crossover field @xmath124 against @xmath95 ( open squares ) , and @xmath125 , represented by the dashed line , that marks a transition to the normal state by the overheating ( as inferred in ref.@xcite for sample n).,width=283 ]    if we now compare @xmath126 and @xmath127 in regime ii , we see in fig.1 that , in contrast to the situation close to @xmath2 , @xmath128 for @xmath116 k and 1.1 k , again with the difference being larger at lower @xmath9 .",
    "this implies that the holes continue to act as efficient pinning sites even when the nonequilibrium effects start to take place .",
    "however , when the sn fully develops , i.e. in regime iii , we observe a crossover to @xmath90 at an electric field @xmath129 , as demonstrated in fig.4 in an expanded scale for @xmath110 k and @xmath120 .    for @xmath110 k",
    "the crossover appears over a wide @xmath23 range , thus we can study @xmath124 as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "the determined values of @xmath124 are in the inset to fig.4 plotted against @xmath95 by the open squares .",
    "the dashed line represents @xmath130 with @xmath131 v / m , deduced in ref.@xcite for sample n and interpreted as a dynamic phase boundary between the sn mixed state and the normal state .",
    "therefore , in the sn the holes enhance the dissipation even if they pin equilibrium vortices efficiently , and this experimental fact is the subject of the discussion below .    at low @xmath9",
    ", the sn corresponds to electron heating to a temperature @xmath74 ( see section [ nature ] ) , leading to a decrease of @xmath18 and eventually to a transition to the normal state when @xmath132 ( or , equivalently , @xmath133 ) .",
    "the heating also causes an increase of @xmath8 , which implies a weakening of the pinning by the holes in comparison to the equilibrium and wn conditions . in this process",
    "the vortex trajectories depicted in fig.2(c ) are expected to change to those in fig.2(b ) .",
    "in other words , if no vortices are pinned by the holes the spatially modulated @xmath22 governs the vortex motion and we could again expect an enhancement of the dissipation - which is observed indeed .",

    "we find that @xmath139 and @xmath140 are both @xmath141 , where @xmath142 corresponds to the equilibrium @xmath143 .",
    "although @xmath140 and @xmath144 are thus close to unity , the range @xmath145 is not necessarily small .",
    "this is a consequence of the form @xcite of @xmath146e$ ] and @xmath147 that describe the @xmath13 by a replacement @xmath148 ( with @xmath149 ) @xcite . in the approximation of a temperature - independent ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath135 ,",
    "in ref.@xcite found to be applicable , we can calculate @xmath134 by inserting @xmath150 into @xmath151 .",
    "the result of this calculation is displayed in fig.5 , where @xmath152 is plotted vs @xmath23 together with the parameter @xmath111 defined earlier and determined in ref.@xcite .",
    "the @xmath23 dependence of @xmath111 is mainly of a dynamic origin , since the vortices incoming to the holes push those pinned therein , this effect being stronger as the vortex density grows @xcite . at low vortex density the majority of vortices either",
    "stay pinned by the holes for a prolonged time or are scattered to pass through the regions of low current density . in this case the heating must be rather strong for the crossover to occur , for instance @xmath153 at @xmath113 is close to @xmath154 @xmath25 m .",
    "the above explanation of the crossover in terms of an increase of @xmath155 in principle assumes @xmath75 constant over the entire sample , i.e. a complete thermal equilibration within the electron system .",
    "however , @xmath156 can be spatially dependent through the coordinate dependence of the local @xmath20 .",
    "thus , we can not rule out a possibility of a creation of hot spots at the apices of the holes , where @xmath20 is the largest if there is no hole pinning [ see fig.2(b ) ] .",
    "such hot spots may be a cause of the observed widened low-@xmath9 ffi , such as that in fig.1(c ) , but we believe that they do not affect the above picture substantially .",
    "we present and discuss measurements of the voltage - current characteristics in the mixed state of two amorphous nb@xmath0ge@xmath1 microbridges , with and without a line of perforating submicron holes , with emphasis on the strongly nonequilibrium flux flow . in the strongly nonequilibrium regime of vortex",
    "motion we find an enhancement of the dissipation by the holes both close to @xmath2 and well below @xmath2 . the strong equilibrium close to @xmath2",
    "is related to vortices shrunk due to the larkin - ovchinnikov mechanism , the dissipation enhancement is similar to that observed in the weak nonequilibrium and originates in a spatially nonuniform current distribution in the vicinity of the holes .",
    "the effect of the current - density modulation is dominant because of a negligible flux pinning by the holes , which is a consequence of the magnetic - field penetration depth @xmath8 being much larger than the hole diameter . at low temperatures @xmath8 decreases and the holes",
    "pin equilibrium vortices , which reduces the net dissipation .",
    "this effect , however , does not continue in the strong equilibrium , where a crossover to the opposite behaviour occurs .",
    "since the strong nonequilibrium at low temperatures most probably corresponds to electron heating to above the bath temperature , it is likely that the crossover is a consequence of an increase of @xmath8 by the heating , accompanied by a reduction of the pinning strength of the holes .    in the weak nonequilibrium , holes in the geometrical arrangement of our samples",
    "can either enhance or reduce the vortex - motion dissipation .",
    "in contrast , when the strong nonequilibrium fully develops the presence of holes always results in an increased dissipation . together with refs.@xcite and @xcite , the above findings provide a quantitative understanding of the effects of perforating holes on vortex transport over a wide range of possible dynamic forms of the mixed state .",

    "<S> we report on the effects of perforating submicron holes on the vortex dynamics of amorphous nb@xmath0ge@xmath1 microbridges in the strongly nonequilibrium mixed state , when vortex properties change substantially . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the weak nonequilibrium - when the presence of holes may result in either an increase ( close to @xmath2 ) or a decrease ( well below @xmath2 ) of the dissipation , in the strong nonequilibrium an enhanced dissipation is observed irrespectively of the bath temperature . </S>",
    "<S> close to @xmath2 this enhancement is similar to that in the weak nonequilibrium , but corresponds to vortices shrunk due to the larkin - ovchinnikov mechanism . at low temperatures </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement is a consequence of a weakening of the flux pinning by the holes in a regime where electron heating dominates the superconducting properties . </S>"
