    "neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite have provided the first signal of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "these measurements show that ( a ) neutrinos have a non - zero mass and ( b ) _ lepton flavour _ is violated . so far there is no experimental data that indicates that _ lepton number _ is also broken",
    ". however , one expects neutrinos to be _ majorana _ particles , their mass at low energy being described by a unique ( @xmath3 ) dimension-5 operator @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is some high energy scale , @xmath6 a dimensionless coupling constant , and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) the higgs boson ( lepton ) doublets , respectively .",
    "many model realizations of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dim5 ] ) exist , the most famous being the seesaw mechanism .",
    "the latter can be implemented via the exchange of a heavy singlet fermion , usually called type - i seesaw  @xcite .",
    "the exchange of a scalar triplet @xcite is now known as type - ii seesaw  .",
    "the exchange of a fermionic triplet @xcite is called type - iii seesaw in @xcite .",
    "a list of generic 1-loop realizations of eq . ( [ eq : dim5 ] ) can also be found in @xcite .",
    "further seesaw realizations , such as the inverse and the linear seesaw , are discussed in @xcite .    at `` low '' energies one can not decide whether tree - level or loop physics generates eq .",
    "( [ eq : dim5 ] ) , nor can any measurements of neutrino angles , phases or masses distinguish between the different tree - level seesaw realizations . under the assumption of a pure type - i or pure type - ii minimal supergravity seesaw mechanisms , we reconsider here the prospects for reconstructing the underlying high energy parameters from a combination of different measurements .",
    "clearly , observables outside the neutrino sector are needed in order to ultimately learn about the high energy parameters characterizing the seesaw .",
    "the classical tree - level realizations of the simplest type - i seesaw mechanism , unfortunately , can not be put to the test in a direct way .",
    "this can be straightforwardly understood by inverting eq .",
    "( [ eq : dim5 ] ) , which results in @xmath9 gev .",
    "if the cern lhc , due to take first data , finds signs of electroweak scale supersymmetry , indirect insight into the high - energy world might become possible through the search for flavour violation effects  @xcite .",
    "starting from flavour diagonal soft supersymmetry breaking terms at some high energy `` unification '' scale , flavour violation appears at lower energies due to the renormalization group evolution of the soft breaking parameters @xcite . if the seesaw mechanism is responsible for the observed neutrino masses , the neutrino yukawa couplings leave their imprint in the slepton mass matrices as first shown in @xcite .",
    "potentially large lfv is then induced by the flavour off - diagonal structure in the yukawa couplings required by the large mixing angles observed in oscillation experiments @xcite .",
    "expectations for lfv decays such as @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the supersymmetric seesaw have been studied in @xcite . for the related process of @xmath12 conversion in nuclei",
    "see , for example @xcite .",
    "the potential of lhc experiments in probing the allowed seesaw parameters through measurements of masses and branching ratios of supersymmetric particles has been also discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in two previous studies",
    "@xcite we have pointed out that ratios of branching ratios are especially useful for learning about the unknown seesaw parameters . in @xcite the case of type - i seesaw was discussed , whereas @xcite addresses the case of seesaw type - ii .",
    "for the type - i seesaw , there are in general too many unknown parameters that preclude making any definite predictions for lfv decays .",
    "in contrast , in the simplest type - ii seesaw model ( with only one triplet coupling to standard model leptons ) neutrino mixing angles can be related to ratios such as br(@xmath13)/br(@xmath14 ) .",
    "it has been shown that , to a good approximation , such ratios do not depend on the msugra parameter values . however , from an experimental point of view , calculations of absolute event rates are needed , before ratios of different final state channels can be studied .",
    "in @xcite we took as reference just a few benchmark msugra points , for which we have made detailed studies . in the present paper",
    "we calculate branching ratios and event rates over a large region of msugra parameter space , in order to identify the maximal number of events one can expect in experiments at the lhc , while still respecting all low - energy constraints .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we give a short summary of the theoretical setup . in section",
    "iii we describe our numerical procedure and present our results .",
    "finally we close in section iv with a discussion and a short summary .",
    "in order to fix the notation , we will briefly discuss the main features of the seesaw mechanism and msugra .",
    "the type - i supersymmetric seesaw consists in extending the particle content of the mssm by three gauge singlet `` right - handed '' neutrino superfields .",
    "the leptonic part of the superpotential is then @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the charged lepton and neutrino yukawa couplings , while @xmath18 are the `` right - handed '' neutrino superfields with @xmath19 majorana mass terms .",
    "one can always choose a basis in which the majorana mass matrix of the `` right - handed '' neutrinos is brought to diagonal form @xmath20 .",
    "without loss of generality we will also assume that eq .",
    "( [ su_pot ] ) is written in the basis where the charged lepton yukawa matrix is already diagonal . in this simple setup , the type - i seesaw model , as defined by eq .",
    "( [ su_pot ] ) , is characterized by a total of 21 parameters , from which only 12 are measurable in the low - energy theory , as we discuss below .",
    "the effective mass matrix of the `` left - handed '' neutrinos at low energies is then given as @xmath21 so that , for each `` right - handed '' neutrino , there is one non - zero eigenvalue in @xmath22 . in eq .",
    "( [ meff ] ) we use the notation @xmath23 for the vacuum expectation values of the neutral components of the higgs boson doublets",
    ".    the parameters of eq.([su_pot ] ) are defined at the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale , whereas the entries of eq .",
    "( [ meff ] ) are measured at low energies . in order to connect these two scales",
    "we numerically solve the full set of renormalization group equations ( rge ) @xcite .",
    "being complex symmetric , the light majorana neutrino mass matrix in eq .",
    "( [ meff ] ) , is diagonalized by a unitary @xmath24 matrix @xmath25  @xcite @xmath26    inverting the seesaw equation , eq .",
    "( [ meff ] ) , allows to express @xmath17 as @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the diagonal matrix with @xmath29 eigenvalues and in general @xmath30 is a complex orthogonal matrix .",
    "note that , in the special case @xmath31 , @xmath17 contains only `` diagonal '' products @xmath32 . in this simplified case the 18 parameters in @xmath17",
    "are reduced to 12 .",
    "note that in general type - i seesaw schemes , the unitary matrix diagonalizing the effective neutrino mass matrix differs from the lepton mixing matrix by terms of order @xmath33 , where the @xmath34 .",
    "for the high - scale schemes considered here one can safely neglect these deviations  . in this case",
    "we can set the diagonalization matrix as the lepton mixing matrix ( partially ) determined in neutrino oscillation measurements .",
    "implementing the type - ii seesaw mechanism within supersymmetry requires at least two @xmath35 triplet states @xmath36 .",
    "a scalar triplet with mass below the gut scale changes the running of @xmath37 and @xmath38 in an unwanted way and gauge coupling unification is lost .",
    "if instead one adds only complete @xmath39 multiplets ( or gut multiplets which can be decomposed into complete @xmath39 multiplets ) to the standard model particle content , the scale where couplings unify remains the same ( at one loop level ) , only the value of the gut coupling itself changes @xcite .",
    "our numerical calculation uses an @xmath39 inspired model @xcite , which adds a pair of @xmath40 and @xmath41 to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) particle spectrum .",
    "this variant of the type - ii seesaw mechanism , as discussed above , allows us to maintain gauge coupling unification even for @xmath42 , @xmath43 being the unification scale . under @xmath44",
    "the @xmath40 decomposes as @xmath45 @xmath46 has the correct quantum numbers to generate the dimension-5 operator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dim5 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath39 invariant superpotential reads @xmath47 here , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . below the gut scale , in the @xmath39-broken phase",
    ", the superpotential contains the terms @xmath52 as long as @xmath53 , gauge coupling unification will be preserved .",
    "note that exact equality is not required for a successful unification . in our numerical studies",
    "we have taken into account the different running of these mass parameters .    integrating out the heavy triplets at their mass scale , the dimension-5 operator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dim5 ] ) is generated and after electroweak symmetry breaking the resulting neutrino mass matrix can be written as @xmath54 as in the case of the type - i seesaw , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ssii ] ) depends on the energy scale . in order to compute the neutrino mass @xmath55 measured at low energies",
    ", one needs to know @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 as input parameters at the high energy scale . as will be discussed in section [ sec : num ] , one can use an iterative procedure in order to find the high scale parameters from the low energy measured quantities .",
    "note that , without loss of generality , we have the freedom to write eqs .",
    "( [ su_pot ] ) and ( [ eq : pot15 ] ) in the basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal , fitting the corresponding yukawa couplings so as to reproduce the three measured charged lepton masses .",
    "however note that there are important differences between the type - i and type - ii seesaw schemes .",
    "for example , in contrast to type - i , in a pure type - ii seesaw scheme the unitary matrix @xmath25 that diagonalizes eq .",
    "( [ eq : ssii ] ) coincides with the lepton mixing matrix studied in neutrino oscillations .",
    "moreover , in sequential type - i seesaw for each `` right - handed '' neutrino added there is one non - zero light neutrino mass eigenstate  .",
    "in contrast , in type - ii seesaw one can produce three neutrino masses with just one pair of triplet superfields , with only one triplet directly coupling to leptons .",
    "this implies that in the minimal type - ii seesaw one has less parameters than in the sequential type - i seesaw .",
    "indeed from the 12 parameters in the complex symmetric @xmath57 matrix , one can remove 3 phases by redefining the charged leptons  @xcite .",
    "in addition , from the 3 complex parameters @xmath59 and @xmath58 , one does not enter , as only one of the triplets couples to leptons , and finally , two of the three phases can also be removed by field redefinitions .",
    "the net result is that there are only 11 physical parameters governing neutrino physics  @xcite .",
    "this number is substantially smaller than the 18 free parameters describing the simplest type - i seesaw scheme containing three `` right - handed '' neutrinos  @xcite  .    at low energies a maximum of 9 neutrino parameters can be fixed by measuring lepton properties : 3 neutrino masses , 3 mixing angles and 3 cp phases .",
    "thus from neutrino data only , neither type - i nor type - ii seesaw schemes can be completely reconstructed , even in their simplest realizations . however ,",
    "especially important in the following is the fact that low - energy neutrino angles are directly related to the high - energy yukawa matrix in the type - ii seesaw , whereas no such simple connection exists in the seesaw type - i ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "as already commented , to a good approximation the lepton mixing matrix may be taken in unitary form , with three mixing angles @xmath60 , and three physical cp phases @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "of these only the leptonic analogue of the kobayashi - maskawa phase @xmath62 , taken as the invariant combination @xmath63 would enter the class of lfv processes discussed in this paper , so that we get the standard form , @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 . since no current experiment is sensitive enough to probe leptonic cp violation we take , for simplicity , @xmath67 .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments can be fitted with either a normal hierarchical spectrum ( nh ) , or with an inverted hierarchy ( ih ) one .",
    "if one does not insist in ordering the neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath68 , @xmath69 with respect to increasing mass , the matrix @xmath25 can describe both possibilities without re - ordering of angles . in this convention , which we will use in the following",
    ", @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) corresponds to normal ( inverse ) hierarchy and @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the angles in both types of spectra . basically @xmath72 is measured in solar + reactor experiments , @xmath74 in atmospheric + accelerator experiments and @xmath73 is constrained by reactor neutrino oscillation data .    in the general mssm ,",
    "lfv off - diagonal entries in the slepton mass matrices involve additional free parameters which arise from the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking . in order to relate lfv in the slepton sector with the lfv encoded in @xmath17 or @xmath57 one must assume some particular scheme for supersymmetry breaking . for simplicity and definiteness we will adopt msugra boundary conditions , characterized by four continuous",
    "real and one discrete free parameter , usually denoted as @xmath75 here , @xmath76 is the common scalar mass , @xmath77 the gaugino mass and @xmath78 the common trilinear parameter , all defined at the grand unification scale , @xmath79 gev .",
    "the remaining two parameters are @xmath80 and the sign of the higgs mixing parameter @xmath81 .    in order to have a qualitative understanding of the magnitudes of the lfv rates we first present approximate leading - log analytical solutions for the renormalization group equations  . for the case of type - i seesaw",
    ", the lfv elements induced in the charged left - slepton mass matrix by renormalization group evolution can be approximated as  @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath17 is given in terms of the neutrino parameters by eq .",
    "( [ ynu ] ) and the factor @xmath8 is defined as @xmath83    similarly , one can get an analogous approximate expression for the off - diagonal elements of the charged left - slepton mass matrix characterizing lfv in type - ii seesaw schemes  @xcite .",
    "due to the non - trivial structure of the neutrino yukawa matrix @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ ynu ] ) and of @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ssii ] ) for type - i and type - ii seesaw , respectively , the slepton mass matrices contain calculable lfv entries  @xcite . in order to determine their magnitude we solve the complete set of renormalization group equations , given in  @xcite .",
    "all results presented below have been obtained with the lepton flavour violating version of the program package spheno  @xcite , where the rges for the mssm part are implemented at the 2-loop level .",
    "for definiteness we set neutrino mass squared differences to their current best fit values  @xcite and fix the angles to the tri - bi - maximal ( tbm ) values  @xcite .",
    "fixing the values of other msugra parameters , we used spheno to perform a numerical scan over the @xmath76-@xmath77 plane .",
    "for each point in this plane , we adjust the value of @xmath84 ( @xmath58 ) in order to keep the low energy lfv observable br(@xmath85 ) within its present experimental upper bound or within the expected sensitivity of the upcoming experiments  @xcite .    for type - i seesaw our numerical procedure to fit these masses is as follows . as we have already commented , the large number of free parameters characterizing even the simplest type - i seesaw schemes forces us to make simplifying assumptions in inverting the seesaw equation , eq .",
    "( [ ynu ] ) . as a first step we assume degenerate `` right - handed '' neutrinos and the simplest possible , flavour - blind , structure for the matrix @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath86 moreover",
    ", we fix the values of the light neutrino masses and yukawa couplings to reproduce the tbm angle values . in order to determine the resulting lfv observables we numerically integrate the renormalization group equations taking into account the flavour structure of the @xmath87 matrix .",
    "we integrate out every `` right - handed '' neutrino and its superpartner at the scale associated to its mass , and calculate the corresponding contribution to the dimension - five operator which is evolved to the electroweak scale .",
    "this way we obtain the exact neutrino masses and mixing angles for this first guess .",
    "the difference between the results numerically obtained and the input numbers is then minimized in an iterative procedure until convergence is achieved .    for the type - ii seesaw",
    "the calculations are performed for the * 15 * -plet case , under the assumption @xmath88 at @xmath43 , as discussed above , and including the one - loop rges for the new parameters in spheno . for consistency",
    ", we have also included 1-loop threshold corrections for gauge couplings and gaugino mass parameters at the scale corresponding to the mass of the triplet , @xmath58 .",
    "the mssm part is implemented at the 2-loop level and , thus , in principle one should also consistently include the effect of the * 15 * -plets for all parameters at this level .",
    "however , as discussed in  @xcite , the correct fit of the neutrino data requires that either the triplet ( * 15 * -plet ) yukawa couplings are small and/or that @xmath58 is close to @xmath43 , implying that the ratio @xmath89 is significantly smaller than @xmath90 and thus one expects only small effects . inverting the seesaw equation for any fixed value of @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ssii ] ) , one can get a first guess of the yukawa couplings for any fixed values of the light neutrino masses as a function of the corresponding triplet mass .",
    "this first guess will not give the correct yukawa couplings , since the neutrino masses and mixing angles are measured at low energy , whereas for the calculation of @xmath55 we need to insert the parameters at the high - energy scale .",
    "however , we can use this first guess to numerically run the rges to obtain the exact neutrino parameters ( at low energies ) for these input values .",
    "the difference between the results obtained numerically and the input can then be minimized in a simple iterative procedure until convergence is achieved .",
    "as long as neutrino yukawas are not large , convergence is reached in a few steps . however , in type - ii seesaw schemes , the yukawa couplings run stronger than in the type - i seesaw , thus our initial guess can sizeable deviate from the exact yukawa coupling values .",
    "since neutrino oscillation data requires at least one neutrino mass to be larger than about 0.05 ev , we do not find any solutions for @xmath91 gev .",
    "finally , the calculation of cross sections for the production of supersymmetric particles was done using prospino  @xcite .",
    "the input data was taken from spheno using the susy les houches accord standard format  @xcite .      [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     for type - ii seesaw where we have less parameters , we can look at variations of the result with the values of the triplet higgs boson coupling @xmath56 , a parameter that can not be determined from neutrino data alone as it appears only in the ratio @xmath93 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : ssii ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : prodxbr2 ] we show the dependence of the product of cross section times lfv branching ratios as function of @xmath56 for our standard point .",
    "we should mention that the other higgs boson triplet coupling @xmath94 , does not contribute to lfv decays , and hence is left undetermined by this analysis .",
    "times br of @xmath0 going to @xmath81-@xmath95 lepton pair versus @xmath77 , for our standard choice of parameters : @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 gev , for type - ii seesaw , imposing br(@xmath99 , for a fixed value of @xmath100 gev and different values of @xmath101  ( green ) , 0.5  ( red ) , 0.9  ( blue).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as has been discussed in @xcite , the dominant standard model backgrounds for the process considered are expected to be @xmath102 and @xmath103 production .",
    "the cuts necessary to reduce this background will depend on the details of the susy spectrum and a detailed investigation is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the results of @xcite suggest that the signal should be visible for @xmath104br of order @xmath105 fb .",
    "low energy neutrino experiments , including oscillation studies and neutrinoless double - beta decay searches may , optimistically , determine at most 9 neutrino parameters : the 3 neutrino masses , the 3 mixing angles and potentially the 3 cp violating phases .",
    "this is insufficient to fully reconstruct the underlying mechanism of neutrino mass generation . under the assumption that neutrino masses arise _ a la seesaw _",
    ", we have considered the simplest pure type - i or pure type - ii seesaw schemes in msugra .",
    "we have performed a full scan over the msugra parameter space in order to identify regions where lfv decays of @xmath0 can be maximal , while still respecting low - energy constraints that follow from the upper bounds on br(@xmath85 ) .",
    "we have also estimated the expected number of events for @xmath106 , for a sample luminosity of @xmath107 .",
    "the expected number of events for the other channel @xmath108 is always smaller , as can be seen from the lvf branching ratios presented in section  [ sec : staudecays ] .",
    "we have found that the pure seesaw - ii scheme is substantially simpler and comes closer to be fully reconstructable , provided additional lfv decays are detected and some supersymmetric particles are discovered at the large hadron collider .    note that in what concerns the expected maximum number of events both type - i and type - ii schemes give similar results .",
    "however , as we have seen , given their smaller number of parameters , type - ii seesaw schemes are more likely to be reconstructable through a combination of low energy neutrino measurements , with the possible detection of supersymmetric states and lepton flavour violation at the lhc .",
    "this should encourage one to perform full - fledged dedicated simulations , in order to ascertain their feasibility within realistic experimental conditions  @xcite .",
    "finally we note that we have not exploited the fact the lfv might induce new `` edge variables '' , giving additional information @xcite .",
    "we have focused here on lhc , but mention that a future ilc would be much more suited for measuring lfv susy processes @xcite .",

    "<S> we reconsider the role that the possible detection of lepton flavour violating ( lfv ) decays of supersymmetric particles at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) can play in helping reconstruct the underlying neutrino mass generation mechanism within the simplest high - scale minimal supergravity ( msugra ) seesaw schemes . </S>",
    "<S> we study in detail the lfv scalar tau decays at the lhc , assuming that the observed neutrino masses arise either through the pure type - i or the simpler type - ii seesaw mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a scan over the msugra parameter space in order to identify regions where lepton flavour violating decays of @xmath0 can be maximized , while respecting current low - energy constraints , such as those coming from the bounds on br(@xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the cross section for @xmath2 . though insufficient for a full reconstruction of the seesaw </S>",
    "<S> , the search for lfv decays of supersymmetric states at the lhc brings complementary information to that coming from low energy neutrino oscillation experiments and lfv searches . </S>"
