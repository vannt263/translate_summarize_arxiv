    "hera deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) results on structure functions demonstrate a rapid bremsstrahlung growth of the gluon density at small x. when interpreted in the same framework as the parton model , this growth is predicted to saturate because the gluon occupation number in hadron wave functions saturate at a value maximally of order @xmath1 ; dynamically , nonlinear effects such as gluon recombination and screening by other gluons deplete the growth of the gluon distribution@xcite .",
    "gluon modes with @xmath2 are maximally occupied , where @xmath3 is a dynamically generated semi - hard scale called the saturation scale . for small @xmath4 , @xmath5 is large enough that high occupancy states can be described by weak coupling classical effective theory@xcite .",
    "this color glass condensate description of high energy hadrons and nuclei is universal and has been tested in both dis and hadronic collisions .",
    "in particular , saturation based phenomenological predictions successfully describe recent lhc p+p data @xcite and predict possible geometrical scaling of transverse momentum distribution@xcite similar to the geometrical scaling observed previously in dis .    the object common to dis and hadronic collisions is the dipole cross section @xmath6 . in the cgc framework",
    ", the dipole cross section can be expressed in terms of expectation values of correlators of wilson lines representing the color fields of the target .",
    "the energy dependence of this quantity comes from renormalization group evolution but to get the realistic impact parameter dependence one has to rely on models involving parametrizations constrained by experimental data . in the large @xmath7 limit ,",
    "the dipole cross section is related to the un - integrated gluon distribution inside hadron / nucleus as    @xmath8^{2}. \\label{eq : unint - gluon}\\ ] ]    for hadron - hadron collisions , the inclusive gluon distribution which is @xmath9-factorizable into the products of un - integrated gluon distributions in the target and projectile is expressed as @xmath10",
    "two models of the dipole cross - section that have been extensively compared to hera data are the ip - sat  @xcite and the b - cgc  @xcite models . in the former the impact parameter dependence",
    "is introduced through a normalized gaussian profile function @xmath11 and in the latter through a scale @xmath12 . for a detailed discussion of the parameters involved in these models and their values from fits to hera data , see ref .",

    "the saturation scale in the fundamental representation for both the models can be calculated self consistently solving @xmath13=2(1-e^{-1/2})$ ] .",
    "the corresponding adjoint saturation scale @xmath14 , relevant for hadronic collisions , is obtained by multiplying @xmath15 by 9/4 . in the range @xmath16-@xmath17 ,",
    "the behaviour of @xmath14 ( see fig.[fig : satscale ] left ) at @xmath18 can be approximated by a function of the form @xmath19 with @xmath20 for the b - cgc model and @xmath21 for the ip - sat model .",

    "multiparticle production in high energy hadronic collisions can be treated self consistently in the cgc approach .",
    "the glasma flux tube picture  @xcite predicts  @xcite that the n - particle correlation is generated by the negative binomial distribution @xmath22 .",
    "it is characterized by two parameters , the mean multiplicity @xmath23 and @xmath24 . at a given impact parameter of the collision , the mean multiplicity @xmath25",
    "is obtained by integrating eq .",
    "[ eq : ktfact1 ] over @xmath26 . in the glasma picture , the parameter @xmath27 with @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath29 shown in fig.[fig : satscale ] ( right ) is the number of flux tubes in the overlap area @xmath30 of two hadrons .",
    "convolving @xmath31 with the probability distribution @xmath32 for an inelastic collision at @xmath33-fig .",
    "[ fig : multdist ] ( left)-one obtains @xcite the n - particle inclusive multiplicity distribution as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : multdist ] ( right ) .    various kinematic variables exhibit scaling with the saturation scale@xcite .",
    "the mid - rapidity multiplicity density scales with functional forms like @xmath34 and @xmath35 whereas a linear functional form seem to provide very good fit to the energy dependence of @xmath36 as shown in fig.[fig : scaling][left ] .",
    "these results are suggestive that @xmath37 is the only scale that controls the bulk particle multiplicity . in ref . @xcite it has been shown that @xmath26 spectra in @xmath38 collisions exhibit geometric scaling assuming a simple form of @xmath37 . in our case",
    "we use a scaling variable @xmath39 , where @xmath37 is directly calculated in the ip - sat model . as shown in fig.[fig : scaling][right ] , an approximate scaling below @xmath40 is observed for transverse momentum distribution in @xmath38 collision energy @xmath41 gev .",
    "going to lower energies we observe systematic deviations from the universal curve .",
    "+      in summary , our description of multiplicity distribution successfully describes bulk lhc p+p data .",
    "in particular , we observe that the dominant contribution to multiplicity fluctuations is due to the intrinsic fluctuations of gluon produced from multiple glasma flux tubes rather than from the fluctuations in the sizes and distributions of hotspots .",
    "the @xmath26-spectra in p+p at high energies exhibits universal scaling as a function of @xmath39 .",
    "the observed scaling indicates that particle production in this regime is dominantly from saturated gluonic matter characterized by one universal scale @xmath37 .",
    "ridge like two particle correlation structures in @xmath42 in high multiplicity p+p collisions may provide more detailed insight into its properties  @xcite .",
