    "the circumstellar envelope ( cse ) surrounding sn 1987a consists of an inner equatorial ring ( er ) flanked by two outer rings @xcite .",
    "these rings , created @xmath1020,000 years before the explosion of the supernova , form the waist and caps of an hourglass or ",

    "the spectral energy distribution longward of 5  @xmath11 has evolved continuously in time .",
    "after day 300 a cold dust - like component appeared @xcite .",
    "an asymmetry in the profiles of optical emission lines that appeared at day 530 showed definitely that dust had condensed in the metal rich ejecta of the supernova @xcite .",
    "although it was discovered via spectroscopy @xcite , the presence of the dust could be easily inferred from the spectral energy distribution : as the dust thermalized the energy output , after day 1000 , sn 1987a radiated mainly in the mid infrared @xcite . unfortunately , after approximately day 2000 , the flux emitted from sn 1987a in the thermal spectral region was too weak to be detected by the instruments and telescopes available .",
    "sn 1987a was observed at day 4100 with isocam onboard the esa iso satellite @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported a weak detection of the supernova at day 4300 with oscir at the ctio 4-m telescope .",
    "except for these two observations , there have been no other detections of the mid - ir emission from the ejecta / ring region of sn 1987a over the last five years .",
    "there exist very few mid - infrared observations of supernovae in general .",
    "therefore sn 1987a , the closest known supernova in 400 years , gives us an opportunity to explore the mid - ir properties of supernovae and their dust with the help of the newest generation of large - aperture telescopes and sensitive mid - ir instrumentation .",
    "the new t - recs mid - ir imager / spectrometer at the gemini - s 8 m telescope offers a combined telescope and instrument with diffraction limited imaging (  0.3 `` resolution ) and superbly low thermal emissivity . on 2003 oct 4 ( day 6067 ) , we imaged sn 1987a with t - recs as part of the instrument s system verification program . in a 23 minute on - source co -",
    "added image in the @xmath12-band filter ( @xmath13 7.70 - 12.97  @xmath11 ) , we were easily able to detect and resolve the er ( fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this image shows several luminous `` hot '' spots distributed over the ring .",
    "the calibrated flux density integrated within an aperture of 1.3 '' radius is  9.9 @xmath14 1.5 mjy .",
    "this absolute calibration has been made using @xmath15 = 10.36 @xmath11 .",
    "no color correction was applied and this would most likely increase the flux density . the standard star used for this and all calibrations was hd 37160 , whose flux density was taken to be 8.77 jy in the @xmath12-band . on 2003",
    "dec 1 ( day 6125 ) a short exposure of the supernova in the qa - band ( @xmath13 17.57 - 19.08  @xmath11 ) led to a @xmath16 detection of the resolved er with a flux density of 50.6 @xmath14 6.6 mjy ( this image will be published when reinforced by improved s / n ratio images ) .",
    "we used @xmath17 cma with a flux density of 44.3 jy at 18.30  @xmath11 for the flux calibration of that observation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we compare our @xmath0 data with data obtained in the hei line at ctio @xcite at day 5749 ( fig .  [ fig2]a ) , and in the f656n filter as observed by hst at day 5555 ( fig .",

    "this filter includes the h@xmath17 and [ n ii ] ( @xmath13 6583  ) lines .",
    "our mid - ir image is also compared to the _ chandra _ observatory x - ray image obtained at day 5791 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) @xcite , and the australian telescope national facility ( atnf ) 18.5 ghz ( 12 mm ) maximum entropy restored image at day 6002 @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) .",
    "there is good agreement in shape and size between our mid - ir image and images obtained at other wavelengths .",
    "the mean radii and approximate surface brightness distribution ( brighter on the east side ) of the ring are similar from the x - ray to the radio , demonstrating that the dust is co - extensive with the gas components .",
    "the origin of that brightness asymmetry may be related either to the asymmetric distribution of the ejecta and/or to the density variation in the csm @xcite , or to a time - dependent effect caused by the tilt of the er as discussed by @xcite .",
    "the most likely source of mid - ir radiation is thermal emission from cool dust ( see discussion below ) , whereas the x - ray radiation is thermal emission from very hot gas @xcite .",
    "the radio emission is likely to be synchrotron radiation as is the case for cas  a @xcite , who claim that if the dust were at temperature @xmath18 it could be heated by collisions with fast - moving electrons and ions in the hot gas seen with _",
    "chandra_. @xcite argue that , until 2002 may 15 , hard x - ray and radio emissions were produced by fast shocks in the cs hii region while the optical and soft x - ray emissions came from slower shocks in the denser er .",
    "@xcite report morphological changes in their last _ chandra _ image , which is an indication of the blast wave now appearing to encounter the er in the western side a few years after it reached the eastern side , and note that as of 2002 dec . 31 ( day 5791 ) correlations between the x - ray and the optical / radio images are more complex than the above simple picture .",
    "the origin of the 10  @xmath11 emission for both the er and the ejecta , may be ( 1 ) line emission from atomic species , ( 2 ) synchrotron or free - free emission , or ( 3 ) thermal emission from dust . as for the er , its detection at @xmath1 seems to suggest that the emission is thermal emission from dust .",
    "a black body of temperature @xmath19 can be fitted to our data .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate can be obtained for the dust mass from the formula : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the distance to the supernova , @xmath22 the observed flux at @xmath0 , @xmath23 the dust mass absorption coefficient at this wavelength , and @xmath24 the planck function .",
    "the approximate range for graphite and silicate grains for @xmath25 at @xmath0 is @xmath26 @xmath27  g@xmath8 .",
    "we use @xmath28 kpc @xcite . considering the uncertainty in the temperature",
    "we derive from this formula a dust mass range of @xmath29 .",
    "@xcite reported a plasma temperature of @xmath30 k and a gas density @xmath31 @xmath32 for the hard component of their two - shock model .",
    "according to @xcite our inferred temperature indicates a high gas density ( @xmath33 @xmath32 ) and a large grain size in the er , thus in good agreement with the _ chandra _ x - ray observations .",
    "possible scenarios for the late - time mid - ir emission in type ii supernovae @xcite are ( 1 ) dusty ejecta , ( 2 ) an infrared echo , or ( 3 ) dust heated from circumstellar interaction . in the last case ,",
    "the dust could be ( i ) pre - existing dust in the csm heated by the outer blast wave , or ( ii ) newly formed dust in the ejecta heated by a reverse shock traveling backwards ( in mass ) into the supernova envelope .",
    "our observations show that the bulk of the _ received _ ir flux does nt originate in the metal rich parts of the ejecta ( eg . the weak detection at the center of the ring ) .",
    "moreover , these parts are expanding much more slowly than the outer parts of the h - rich envelope and they have not yet reached the ring . as it is most unlikely that dust formed in the tenuous outer h - rich layers of the sn interacting with the ring , we believe that the ir emission is produced by preexisting dust in the csm heated by the outer blast wave ( scenario 3-i ) .",
    "this interaction converts part of the kinetic energy ( ke ) into radiative output .",
    "that leads to a caveat in our reasoning : we assume that all the emission from the er is in the form of ir emission , and we do not consider the possibility that the dust may just be re - radiating a fraction of the ambient radiation if the heating mechanism were in part due to radiation and not only to collisions .",
    "however , it is most likely that the dust may be shock - heated , in which case the ir emission cools the hot plasma that gives rise to the x - ray emission as well . indeed ,",
    "@xcite show that ir emission from collisionally heated dust is the dominant cooling mechanism of the shocked gas in snr .",
    "@xcite computes the ratio between the cooling function of the gas via gas - grain collisions and that of the gas via atomic processes , as a function of the gas temperature only .",
    "@xcite note that , if the dust that gives rise to the ir emission occupies the same volume as the x - ray emitting plasma ( as appears to be the case in view of our figure 3 ) , this cooling ratio translates into the infrared - to - x - ray flux ratio ( irx ) .",
    "these authors show that the observed values of this ratio is significantly larger than unity for the 9 remnants that they considered , and concluded that ir emission , mostly attributed to gas - grain collisions , is the dominant cooling mechanism in these remnants over large periods of their evolutionary lifetime .",
    "@xcite report that as the blast wave approaches the dense circumstellar material , the contribution from the decelerated slow shock to the observed x - ray emission is becoming significant and increasing more rapidly than ever as of 2002 dec .",
    "they fit their data with a two - temperature model for that epoch , and find a temperature of @xmath34 kev and a luminosity @xmath35 erg s@xmath8 for the decelerated slow shock component , and @xmath36 kev and @xmath37 erg s@xmath8 for the blast wave shock .",
    "combining our data with these results leads to values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "these values fall significantly below the theoretically expected ratios , at roughly the same position as the kepler remnant in figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "these authors argue that in kepler the low irx ratio may mostly reflect the absence of dust in the material heated by the reverse shock .",
    "our observations then suggest that little dust was formed in the ejecta during the presupernova mass loss phase of the progenitor .",
    "we note , however , that the irx calculations were performed for a local interstellar dust abundance and a standard dust - to - mass ratio , which might be unapplicable for sn 1987a .",
    "the @xmath12-band detections of sn 1987a at days 4100 and 4300 suggested that dust was still present in the ejecta and the dominant component of the ejecta s bolometric flux .",
    "however , the iso observations were slightly non - stellar strongly suggesting that some of the dust emission was coming from the inner ring , presumably heated by the shock front as the high - velocity material hits the er material @xcite .",
    "euv radiation is produced in the shock , and ionizes the gas upstream of the shock front revealing the structure and properties of the outer nebula .",
    "@xcite estimate that the cs dust is most likely silicate - iron or a silicate - graphite mixture , or pure graphite .",
    "these types of grains have spectral signatures in the @xmath12-band that were not detected in the dust that condensed in the ejecta @xcite , most probably in the form of x - type sic @xcite .",
    "after day 530 the dust emission became the dominant cooling mechanism of the ejecta of sn 1987a , radiating away the energy from the radioactive nuclides synthesized in the explosion .",
    "what happened then to this early dust emission ?",
    "[ fig1 ] a small flux enhancement with a flux density of @xmath40 mjy ( @xmath41 ) can be seen in the center of the ring .",
    "it is likely that this weak feature is the remains of the dust emission from the condensates in the ejecta .",
    "although the @xmath12 filter contains several ir lines such as ariii ( @xmath42 ) , siv ( @xmath43 ) , and neii ( @xmath44 ) , these lines require too high ionization state to contribute significantly to this emission .",
    "moreover , we note from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the ejecta has not been detected neither in the he i line , nor in the h@xmath17 or [ n ii ] lines .",
    "as the ejecta has not been detected in the radio regime either , the possibility of free - free or synchrotron emission is also ruled out .",
    "therefore it is likely that the weak feature detected at @xmath0 is the remains of the dust emission from the condensates in the ejecta .",
    "probably the er and the ejecta have different dust temperatures as was observed in cas  a @xcite .",
    "we do not detect the ejecta in our qa - band image , which sets a flux upper limit of 41 mjy at the 3-@xmath45 detection level at this wavelength , and then a lower limit for the temperature of the ejecta @xmath46  k. @xcite showed that time - dependent effects due to long recombination and cooling times lead to a frozen - in structure of the ejecta of sn 1987a .",
    "however , @xcite claim that freeze - out is important for hydrogen at times shorter than @xmath103000 days , and that at later stages positron input from @xmath47ti and reverse shock heating are the major sources of energy input to the envelope . in view of their figure 2 ,",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the ejecta should be of the order of @xmath48 erg  s@xmath8 .",
    "assuming that there is no other energy input than the radioactive decays , this luminosity is an upperlimit of the ir luminosity ( e.g. all the energy might not be released in the ir through dust emission ) . to derive this",
    "luminosity given our 10  @xmath11 flux measurement , the dust temperature must be @xmath49  k. thus , our observations give us upper and lower limits , implying a temperature @xmath50  k for the dust in the ejecta .",
    "the dust mass derived from equation ( 1 ) is then @xmath51 considering the same approximate range for @xmath52 of @xmath53 @xmath27  g@xmath8 as for the er .    we stress that the value given here is an upper limit of the ir luminosity , as @xcite show that at day 1153 line emission , mostly due to the [ feii ] @xmath54 transition , and other ground - state fine structure lines at 35 , 51 and 87 @xmath11 , may contribute significantly to the total luminosity .",
    "these authors find for that epoch a dust temperature @xmath55 .",
    "we note that the same caveat given for the er applies to our statement concerning the energetics of the ejecta : we do not consider the mechanical energy , which is in the process of being transferred to the ambient medium through the forward shock or to the ejecta itself through the reverse shock , that can power the observed ir emission .",
    "this issue will be tackled in a forthcoming paper .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows that the flux at 10  @xmath11 declines exponentially from day 2200 through day 4200 ( the isocam and oscir observations ) .",
    "this figure shows two data points for day 6067 ( ejecta and er ) .",
    "the possible ring contribution to day 4200 is unknown .",
    "however , it seems that the ejecta 10  @xmath11 flux from day 6067 lies on the extension of the exponential decline curve that roughly goes through the 10@xmath11 flux at day 4200 .",
    "if one assumes then that the 10@xmath11 emission from the ejecta indeed follows an exponential decline law , that leaves no room for any ring contribution to day 4200 .",
    "we conclude therefore that the 10  @xmath11 flux decline of the ejecta from day 2200 to 6000 is roughly 0.32  mag  y@xmath8 , and that the ring emission started most likely around day 4000 or later , in good agreement with fig .  5 of @xcite for atca and chandra / rosat data .",
    "@xcite report on the detection of dust emission in the near - ir spectra of the type iin supernovae sn 1998s ( a supernova similar to sn 1987a ) and sn 1997ab , and summarize dust emission in other supernovae : the ir excess observed in sn 1979c and sn 1985l is interpreted as dust forming in the ejecta , while it is attributed to dust lying in a preexisting csm in sn 1982e , sn 1982l , sn 1982r , sn 1993j , sn 1994y , and sn 1999el @xcite . although it has been claimed @xcite that the near - ir emission from sn 1980k can be explained as an ir echo , we note that this supernova displayed , together with an ir excess , large blueshifts of the [ o i ] and [ o iii ] lines of @xmath103300 km  s@xmath8 @xcite compared with 1870 km  s@xmath8 in sn 1987a , which seems to imply that dust has formed also in the ejecta of sn 1980k .",
    "also , @xcite presented clear evidence for dust formation in the type iip sn 1999em 500 days after explosion .",
    "@xcite detected a continuum consistent with silicate dust of very small pyroxene grains ( mgsio@xmath56 ) in the youngest known galactic snr cas  a.    all of these above observations of dust in supernovae may lead us to the conclusion that supernovae could be a major source for interstellar dust .",
    "various indirect arguments @xcite and theoretical calculations @xcite also suggest that hypothesis .",
    "nevertheless stellar winds from various types of stars are still considered a major source of dust production .",
    "for instance , @xcite argue that supergiants and agb stars form the bulk of the dust in the galaxy , not supernovae .",
    "@xcite argue that sne are at least as important as stellar winds in producing dust in our galaxy and in galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "@xcite also conclude that sne , or their progenitors , may be important dust formation sites .",
    "several theoretical models predicted the presence of dust in the cse of sn 1987a which was produced by a wind in the supergiant phase . the cs dust is likely to be in the form of pyroxene or graphite grains , while the dust condensed in the ejecta is most probably of some type of silicon carbide .",
    "forthcoming imaging and spectroscopic observations focusing on line versus continuum emission should determine the type of emission present , and are required to clarify the issue of the energetics of the supernova .",
    "finally , in order to assess the role of sne in the production of dust in the universe , it is clearly important to measure the presence of dust that survives into the formation of the remnants , and for this , mid - ir and sub - mm observations are critical .",
