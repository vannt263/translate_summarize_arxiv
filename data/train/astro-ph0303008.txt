    "high velocity ( @xmath4  kms@xmath0 ) directed outflows play a dramatic role in the rapid evolution of stars from the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) to the planetary nebula ( pn ) phase .",
    "the outflows interact with the roughly spherical molecular envelopes ejected by the stars on the agb , producing strong shocks that pierce and disrupt the circumstellar gas ( e.g. , cox et al .",
    "2000 ; huggins et al .",
    "observations of shock diagnostics in objects that have only recently left the agb are therefore of considerable interest in constraining this crucial evolutionary phase .",
    "afgl  618 is a bipolar proto - planetary nebula ( ppn ) , which evolved from the agb about @xmath5 ago ( kwok & bignell 1984 ) .",
    "it was first identified by westbrook et al .",
    "( 1975 ) and since then it has been extensively observed .",
    "the presence of high - velocity molecular gas has been reported extending over @xmath6250  kms@xmath0  in h@xmath2 1@xmath30 s(1 ) ( burton & geballe 1986 ; kastner et al .",
    "2001 ) and @xmath6400  kms@xmath0  in co ( cernicharo et al . 1989 ; gammie et al . 1989 ) .",
    "high velocities are also seen in optical lines ( e.g. , carsenty & solf 1982 ) and the outflows appear as spectacular jet features in the _ hst _ images published by trammell & goodrich ( 2002 ) . in this _",
    "letter _ , we report high velocity resolution ( @xmath7 ) spectro - imaging of afgl  618 in the h@xmath2 1@xmath30 s(1 ) line that reveals the detailed structure and kinematics of the shocked molecular gas , and its relation to the optical jets .",
    "the observations were made on october 6 , 2000 using the _ bear _ imaging fts at the f/35 infrared focus of the 3.60-meter canada - france - hawaii telescope . a detailed description of _ bear _ and the data reduction is given by maillard ( 2000 ) .",
    "the 256@xmath8256 hgcdte facility camera provides a circular field of view of 24@xmath9 diameter , and the plate scale on the detector is 035/pixel .",
    "the seeing at 2  @xmath10 during the observations was typically 05 .",
    "afgl  618 was observed through a narrow band filter ( @xmath11 ) which includes the h@xmath2 1@xmath30 s(1 ) line at 4712.9  cm@xmath0 ( 2.12  @xmath13 ) .",
    "the raw data consist of a cube of 1150 planes with an integration time of 9  sec per image , an image being taken at each step of the interferometer .",
    "the maximum path difference corresponds to a resolution ( fwhm ) of 0.137  cm@xmath0 , i.e. 8.9  km  s@xmath0 . a data cube of the star hd  162208 ( @xmath14  =  7.11 ) was obtained for calibration .",
    "the 2  @xmath10 continuum emission of afgl  618 , which is found to be strongly peaked toward the center , has been subtracted from each plane of the cube .",
    "we have used the _ hst _",
    "images and the j - band and h@xmath2 images of ueta et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to determine the co - ordinates of the _ bear _ data .",
    "the velocity integrated image of afgl  618 in the h@xmath2 1@xmath30 s(1 ) line is shown in fig .  1 , together with the _ hst _ image in h@xmath15 .",
    "the h@xmath2 emission is dominated by two bipolar lobes which are oriented at @xmath16 , and correspond to the jet system seen in the h@xmath15 emission of the shocked - ionized gas .",
    "the kinematic structure of the h@xmath2 emission is found to be complex , and we present different aspects of the data in figs .",
    "the top panel in fig .  2 shows the h@xmath2 1@xmath30 s(1 ) spectrum of the whole nebula .",
    "the emission peaks at a velocity of @xmath17  kms@xmath0  ( lsr ) , and shows broad wings extending from @xmath18 to + 160  kms@xmath0 , in agreement with previous observations ( e.g. , burton & geballe 1986 ) .",
    "the peak is blue - shifted relative to the systemic velocity measured in co ( @xmath19  kms@xmath0 , cernicharo et al .",
    "1989 ) , probably because of extinction . at low expansion velocities , maps of the h@xmath2",
    "are roughly symmetric about the center , but at higher velocities there is a clear blue / red separation to the east and west , respectively ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "the nebula in h@xmath2 is therefore tilted to the line of sight toward us in the east , consistent with the optical appearance .",
    "the strongest h@xmath2 emission lies @xmath20 each side of the center near the systemic velocity , but the emission near these positions also extends to the highest velocities .",
    "this is seen in spectra at these two positions ( fig .  2 ,",
    "center ) , which also show steep sided profiles in the red and blue wings to the east and west , respectively .",
    "the relation of these spectra to the overall kinematics is seen in the position - velocity diagram along the nebula axis shown in fig .  4 ",
    "see also kastner et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "in addition to the main kinematic structure described above , a striking aspect of our data is the presence of localized , high - velocity features in the @xmath21 emission which are associated with the optical jets seen in the h@xmath15 image .",
    "1 already suggests some relation between the @xmath21 and h@xmath15 emission , and this becomes evident in the @xmath21 channel maps at the extreme red- and blue - shifted velocities ( fig .",
    "3 ) . at these high velocities ,",
    "discrete structures trace the locations of individual optical jets seen in the underlying _ hst _ image .",
    "these features can be followed in the data cube in position and velocity , and delineate the interaction of the jets with the molecular envelope .    on account of the tilt of afgl  618 to the line of sight and the high optical extinction toward the equatorial regions (",
    "@xmath22 , e.g. , snchez contreras et al .",
    "2002 ) , there is less obscuration of the east lobe of the nebula .",
    "the optical jets are best seen on this side , and it is here that they show the clearest correspondence with the high velocity features seen in @xmath21 .",
    "the correspondence is less complete in the west lobe , probably in part due to the higher optical extinction near the center , but also as a result of real differences ( e.g. , high velocity @xmath21 lies part way along jet _ a _ in fig .  3 , but not along the whole length ) which could reflect the geometry and/or strength of the interactions .",
    "5 presents a sequence of channel maps that show the relation between the optical jets and the h@xmath2 in the east lobe in detail .",
    "the origin of the optical jets can not be traced near the star due to extinction , but @xmath21 at intermediate velocities ( @xmath23  kms@xmath0 ) is detected near the base of the jets where they diverge from the center . at successively higher velocities , the @xmath21 develops into separate , localized , structures that follow individual optical jets .",
    "four separate structures can be seen corresponding to all four jets identified by trammel & goodrich ( 2002 ) in the east lobe ( _ b _ , _ c _ , _ d _ , and _ e _ ) . jet _",
    "b _ is traced out to @xmath24  kms@xmath0 .",
    "c _ and _ e _ appear to be connected , with jet _ c _ terminating at @xmath25163  kms@xmath0 , and the associated jet _",
    "e _ with an additional component extending to @xmath26  kms@xmath0 .",
    "the highest velocities ( @xmath18  kms@xmath0 ) are associated with jet _ d _ , which is short and protrudes near the base of the jet system .",
    "three features of the observations provide further information on the relation of the jets to the molecular emission . first , although the @xmath21 emission is not well spatially resolved across the jets , it is resolved along the extended jets _ b _ and _ c_+_e _ , and shows a velocity gradient , increasing away from the center .",
    "second , unlike the @xmath27 , the @xmath21 emission is not strongly peaked at the head of the optical jets but extends downstream toward the star .",
    "third , the @xmath21 line widths observed near the heads of the jets are narrow ( @xmath28  kms@xmath0 ) compared with the bulk velocity of the gas relative to the systemic velocity ( fig .  2 , bottom panel ) .",
    "the overall distribution and kinematics of the @xmath21 suggests that the main emission arises in roughly formed , biconical cavities , consistent with the overall picture inferred from optical images .",
    "the steep - sided spectra ( fig .  2 ) and the sudden change from red- to blue - shifted gas near the systemic velocity ( fig .",
    "3 & 4 ) indicate that the far side of the approaching ( east ) lobe and the near side of the receding ( west ) lobe lie close to the plane of the sky .",
    "the highest velocity gas then arises near the center , in the sides of the lobes that lie closest to the line of sight .",
    "the east - west ( blue - red ) tilt of the optical jets ( e.g. , snchez contreras et al .",
    "2002 ) which form the lobes , and the angles of individual jets with respect to the line of sight estimated by trammel & goodrich ( 2002 ) ( 51 , 31 , and 54  for jets _",
    "b _ , _ c _ , and _",
    "d _ , respectively ) are consistent with this general picture , although the short projected length of jet _ d _ , and the very high velocity that we observe in @xmath21 suggest that it may be the closest to the line of sight . given the short lifetime for optical emission from the jets ( a few years , e.g. , snchez - contreras et al . 2002 ) compared to their dynamical time scales of @xmath29  yr ( see   4.2 ) , there could also be a history of outflows which partially excavated the biconical cavities in addition to those currently seen in the _ hst _ image .",
    "our observations cast light on the long - standing problem of the origin of the very high velocity h@xmath2 emission in afgl  618 ( e.g. , burton & geballe 1986 ; hartquist & dyson 1987 ) . figs .  3 and 5",
    "show that the emission arises from the interaction of jets with the circumstellar gas .",
    "the presence of @xmath21 emission along the length of the optical jet structures is consistent with a class of models in which the ambient gas is shocked and dragged along with the jet through prompt or steady entrainment ( e.g. , hartigan et al . 1996 ) ; similar cases are seen in the outflows around young stellar objects ( e.g. , bachiller 1996 ) .",
    "the kinematics that we observe place valuable constraints on such a picture .",
    "the @xmath21 line widths near the heads of the jets ( @xmath28  kms@xmath0 ) set upper limits on the turbulence which is believed to play a key role in the entrainment process . on the other hand ,",
    "the bulk velocity of the molecular gas is extremely high .",
    "for example , the observed radial velocity of the @xmath30 just behind the head of jet _ b _ is @xmath31  kms@xmath0(relative to the systemic velocity ) ; if the inclination to the line of sight is @xmath32 ( see above ) , the actual velocity is @xmath33  kms@xmath0 , and if the angle of inclination is @xmath34 ( snchez contreras et al .",
    "2002 ) the velocity is 340  kms@xmath0 . for an adopted distance of 1.5  kpc to afgl  618 , the dynamical timescale of the jet is @xmath29  yr .",
    "the velocities are much too large for the molecular gas to survive acceleration in a single shock , for which the maximum velocity is @xmath35  kms@xmath0  ( draine , roberge , & dalgarno 1983 ) .",
    "however , it is possible for the molecules to reform in the post - shock gas ( e.g. , hollenbach & mckee 1989 ; neufeld & dalgarno 1989 ) although models of high velocity bow shocks including molecule reformation have not yet been developed .",
    "it is striking that the h@xmath2 velocities that we observe are significantly higher than those indicated by observations of optical lines .",
    "the interpretation of optical line ratios at the heads of the jets using shock models yields shock velocities of only 40100  kms@xmath0(trammell & goodrich 2002 ) .",
    "the observed radial velocities in optical lines at the head of jet _ b _ are @xmath36  kms@xmath0(snchez contreras et al .",
    "2002 ) , and when corrected for an inclination of 5166  ( see above ) give values of @xmath37200  kms@xmath0 , the latter similar to shock velocities estimated from the optical line widths ( snchez contreras et al .",
    "2002 ) . however , independent of the inclination angle , the observed @xmath21 velocity in jet _ b _ is a factor of @xmath38 higher than the optical lines at the head .",
    "if the h@xmath2 emission that we observe is shocked excited circumstellar gas , as seems most likely , then the high velocities that we observe suggest an even higher velocity , collimated driving wind .",
    "in addition , the differences between the h@xmath2 and optical line velocities indicate a range in shock conditions , which is not unlikely given the small scale structure seen in the h@xmath15 image . a possible , alternative scenario for the origin of the high velocity molecular gas in one in which the molecules are entrained or formed in the outflows close to their source , so are already present at high velocity and are excited by interactions with the ambient gas in the regions observed .",
    "spectro - imaging of the optical lines with both higher spectral and spatial resolution than are currently available will be important to further study these issues .",
    "the h@xmath2 observations reported here trace the detailed structure and kinematics of the molecular outflows in afgl  618 which are also seen at lower angular resolution in other probes of the molecular gas .",
    "the full h@xmath2 spectrum shown in fig .",
    "2 resembles that of the co lines ( e.g. , cernicharo et al .",
    "1989 ) , and the shift from blue to red in going from the east to the west side of the nebula ( fig .",
    "3 ) is also seen in millimeter molecular maps ( e.g. , neri et al . 1992 ; hajian et al .",
    "1996 ; meixner et al .",
    "however , the co bullets reported by ueta et al .",
    "( 2001 ) at high negative velocities on the west side of the nebula are at variance with the overall kinematics reported here , and are probably not real .",
    "the present observations provide evidence that the high velocity h@xmath2 outflows in afgl  618 are the result of the interaction of jets with the circumstellar envelope .",
    "similar examples of this type of interaction at different stages of development are seen in afgl  2688 ( cox et al .",
    "2000 ) , m1 - 16 ( huggins et al .",
    "2000 ) , and ngc  7027 ( cox et al . 2002 ) .",
    "all these cases support a view in which the geometry of the circumstellar gas around a newly forming pn is largely determined by the action of the jets , and plays a key role in determining the morphology of the fully formed pn .",
