    "the fabrication of the samples starts with spin coating of 4% in anisole 495k pmma ( microchem ) at 5000 rpm followed by 2% in anisole 950k pmma at 5000 rpm to form a bi - layer resist on piranha cleaned quartz pieces . a thin ( 15 nm ) aluminum layer is then evaporated to prevent the charging of the transparent substrate during e - beam lithography . a 100 kv e - beam lithography system ( vistec ebpg5000pluses )",

    "we then use a single pixel , 2 mm diameter thorlabs det20c ingaas detector ( @xmath25 ) to measure the light from the output antenna .",
    "we also use a thorlabs s122c ge detector ( @xmath26 ) to account for any fluctuations in the laser power level .",

    "two mirrors ( @xmath27 ) are used to align the laser beam to the high na microscope objective lens ( leica hc pl fluotar 100x/0.90 pol ) with @xmath28 mm , used to focus light onto the input antenna .",

    "we used a removable reticle ( thorlabs r1ds2p ) at the image plane to help with the alignment .",
    "another achromatic doublet ( thorlabs ac254 - 100-c ) with @xmath34 mm is used to relay the image to @xmath25 .",

    "our measurement protocol is as follows .",
    "we mount the sample on a piezo stage ( thorlabs nanomax - ts ) with pitch and roll control ( thorlabs apr001 ) and make sure that the sample surface is perpendicular to the laser beam .",
    "we set the wavelength to 1550 nm , rotate the thorlabs ahwp05m-1600 half - wave plate ( @xmath36 ) and maximize the power through @xmath29 .",
    "we set @xmath37 , and focus the laser light on the quartz substrate by minimizing the beam width via adjusting the sample distance to the objective lens by the piezo controller .",
    "we then set @xmath38 and observe the formation of the clover pattern on quartz , typical of gaussian beams when focused by a high na objective @xcite .",
    "we move the clover pattern over the input antenna , observe some light from the output antenna , use the iris to block the clover pattern and get light only from the output antenna .",
    "we turn - off the led , remove the pellicle , switch to @xmath25 , and get a reading from the lock - in amplifier ( srs sr830 ) .",
    "we maximize the lock - in reading by moving the sample via the piezo controller in the plane perpendicular to the laser light , without changing the sample to objective lens distance .",

    "[ figdata](c ) ] .",
    "there is considerable leakage from the stub section , and the antenna output intensity is quite low , as highlighted by the white - dashed circle . on the other hand , when the wavelength moves away from the stub resonance and @xmath41 increases , leakage from the stub decreases and the antenna output becomes more pronounced [ fig .  [ figcam](b ) ] .",
    "we show the results for the power transmission through waveguides without stub resonators ( @xmath42 ) in fig .",
    "[ figdata](a ) .",
    "we normalize the experimental curves with an estimate of the incident power which is obtained by measuring the reflection of laser light from a large metal patch on the sample while @xmath37 .",
    "we obtain data from nine different samples , similar to fig .",
    "[ figsem](a ) , with a total waveguide length @xmath43 m. although the nine samples had exactly the same e - beam mask , due to variations during the fabrication , we see variations in @xmath42 .",
    "we average over the measurements to obtain the thick red line in fig .",
    "[ figdata](a ) .",
    "we also calculate @xmath42 via , where in @xmath23 simulations we take into account the changes in the gaussian beam width and center position as the wavelength is scanned ( measured experimentally from camera images of the beam reflecting off of a blank quartz section on the sample ) .",
    "we normalize the calculated @xmath42 ( black curve ) so that it has the same maximum value as the average measurement results ( red curve ) .",
    "the fringes in @xmath42 are due to the low - q cavity formed by the antennas and the @xmath43 m waveguide .",
    "as reported in @xcite the fringe spacing and depth can be used to obtain the real and imaginary parts of @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the calculated @xmath22 values correctly gave us the fringe spacing which is a function of the real part of @xmath22 ; to match the fringe depths , we had to increase the imaginary part of @xmath22 by 50% to give us a power transmission length , @xmath44 , of 5.3 m for the waveguide mode at 1550 nm .",
    "we get very good correspondence between the measurements and the model around 1550 nm , the wavelength at which we focus our laser beam .",
    "the correspondence deteriorates at lower and higher wavelengths , probably due to the non - orthogonality of the sample surface to the laser beam and chromatic aberrations .",

    "[ figsem](b - c ) , and @xmath52 nm for fig .  [ figsem](d ) .",
    "these values were chosen so that the resonators in all three cases would have a transmission maximum at 1550 nm . however , due to over correcting for the proximity effect during the e - beam exposure , we had longer stubs in the fabricated samples as observed from sem images .",
    "as a result , the resonators were all resonant at 1650 nm .",
    "we fitted @xmath47 values so that the experimental @xmath48 values and those calculated via  agree well with each other . in",

    ", there is a good overlap between the predictions of the scattering matrix model and the experimental data .",
    "furthermore , we see that @xmath48 follows @xmath49 , with extra ripples due to the low - q resonances set up in between the two antennas and the connecting waveguide .    in conclusion , we experimentally characterized stub resonators embedded in plasmonic slot waveguides .",
    "we used the scattering matrix based characterization of the resonators in an extended model which takes into account the coupling of a gaussian beam into the slot waveguide mode by an optical antenna .",
    "we provided details of the optical characterization setup and have shown that the measurements and modeling agree with each other .",
