    "throughout this paper , for brevity , we represent the set of even counting numbers by the capital letter @xmath0 , the set of odd counting numbers by the capital letter @xmath1 , and the set of natural numbers , @xmath2 , by @xmath3 .",
    "+ in this paper we first define the term _ catalan tree _ and then study its combinatorical properties . later",
    "we explore the parity of some sequences which are related to catalan numbers .",
    "the catalan numbers are an infinite sequence of integers 1 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 14 , 42 , 132 , 429 , 1430 , 4862 , @xmath4 .",
    "they are defined by the following recurrence relation : @xmath5 it also has the following explicit formula @xmath6 and for large @xmath7 , @xmath8 behaves like @xmath9 , see  @xcite .",
    "+   + the catalan number appears in many areas of mathematics just like the fibonacci number .",
    "specifically they are related in combinatorical settings such as trees , lattice paths , partitions , ( see  @xcite ) and even within propositional logic , ( see  @xcite ) . here",
    "we go one step further and define what a catalan tree is .",
    "the nth * catalan tree * , @xmath10 , is a combinatorical object , characterized by one root , @xmath11 main - branches , and @xmath8 sub - branches . where each main - branch gives rise to a number of sub - branches , and the number of these sub - branches",
    "is determined by the additive partition of the corresponding catalan number , as determined by the recurrence relation ( [ e:1 ] ) .",
    "the tree @xmath10 can be represented symbolically as follows : @xmath12 note that the main - branches and the sub - branches exist iff @xmath13 .",
    "here is an example : the catalan tree @xmath14 , has one root , ( 1 ) , followed by 3 main - branches , @xmath15 , and each main - branch gives rise to @xmath16 sub - branches respectively .",
    "also this combinatorical object can be represented by a graph :        the diagram above shows the first five stages of the catalan tree , @xmath10 , where @xmath17 is defined in proposition  [ p:1 ] .",
    "[ p:1 ] for @xmath13 , let @xmath10 denote the nth catalan tree , and let @xmath17 denote the number of components of @xmath10 . then @xmath18    by definition there are 1 root , @xmath11 main branches and @xmath8 sub - branches . therefore @xmath19 , for @xmath13 , and @xmath20 , @xmath21.@xmath22    using proposition  [ p:1 ] , it is straightforward to calculate the values of @xmath17 .",
    "the table below illustrates this up to @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24    let @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the generating functions for @xmath17 , @xmath8 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "thus @xmath28    the generating function for the sequence @xmath29 is given by @xmath30    for @xmath13 , the explicit formula for @xmath17 is given by , @xmath31    the following result is a consequence of the asymptotic behavior of catalan numbers .    for large @xmath7",
    ", we have the asymptotic formula @xmath32",
    "in this section we determine the parity of the sequences that we have discussed in @xcite , and as well as the parity of the sequences which are related to the sequences in @xcite .",
    "the following lemma [ l:1 ] has been proven by number of other authors , ( see  @xcite , ( 1986 ) ) , ( see  @xcite , ( 2004 ) ) and ( see  @xcite , ( 2008 ) ) .",
    "but , they took @xmath7 to be a mersenne number , this is due to the fact that the catalan numbers were shifted by one term forward in their work .",
    "from the segner s recurrence relation , @xmath8 can be expressed as a piecewise function , with respect to the parity of @xmath7 , ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* page , 329 ) ) .",

    "then    @xmath45    @xmath22    [ t : f ] let @xmath46 be the number of rows with the value `` false '' in the truth tables of all bracketed formulea with @xmath7 distinct propositions @xmath47 connected by the binary connective of implication .",
    "then in  @xcite we have shown that the following results are true : @xmath48 and for large @xmath7 , @xmath49 .",
