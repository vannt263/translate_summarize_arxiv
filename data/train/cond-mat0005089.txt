    "non  extensive systems are those for which the thermodynamic potentials do not scale linearly with the system size . as a way of example , in some electric or magnetic systems with very long  range interactions the ground state energy per particle increases with the number of particles . in the absence of other effects , such as screening ,",
    "these system are  genuinely \" non  extensive . if we apply to them the standard boltzmann ",
    "gibbs formalism of the statistical mechanics , we find that the internal energy , helmholtz free energy and other thermodynamic potentials are non  extensive as well",
    ". this standard formalism can be implemented by using the definition of the entropy @xmath3 in terms of the probabilities @xmath4 of the @xmath5 possible microscopic configurations is equal to @xmath6 :    @xmath7    the actual calculation of the entropy assumes a set of probabilities @xmath8 .",
    "these are computed by finding the maximum of the above expression when some extra conditions defining an ensemble ( fixed number of particles and mean energy , for example ) are imposed .    even for systems in which the energy levels do scale with the system size , it is possible , by using generalized definitions of the entropy , to obtain non  extensive thermodynamic potentials .",
    "one of the most successful generalizations is that of tsallis which in 1988 proposed @xcite the following alternative expression for the entropy :    @xmath9    where @xmath1 is an entropic index that characterizes the _ degree of non ",
    "extensivity_. it is possible to show that the entropy of the composed system a+b satisfies the relation :    @xmath10    when a and b are independent systems in the sense that @xmath11 .",
    "we see that for @xmath12 there is no additivity in the entropy , which also implies non  extensivity .",
    "the boltzmann ",
    "gibbs entropy , eq .",
    "( [ e0 ] ) , and extensivity are recovered in the limit @xmath13 .",
    "since the probabilities @xmath8 satisfy @xmath14 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 for @xmath17 , the superextensive , @xmath15 , and the subextensive , @xmath17 , regimes will privilege the _ rare _ and _ frequent _ events respectively .    in the last years",
    "there have been many studies in which tsallis non  extensive statistics has been applied to different situations ( see @xcite for a review ) . in some cases , the systems considered are genuinely non  extensive ( in the sense defined above ) while in others the non  extensivity arises as a result of the application of the new statistics .",
    "in fact , and due to the intrinsic non  extensivity of the tsallis statistics , it has been argued that its natural range of applicability should include systems with long  range interactions or long  range microscopic memory processes , as well as dynamical systems in which the space  time geometry has a multifractal  like structure , because those systems are in general genuinely non  extensive .",
    "although most of the literature ( including this paper ) basically derives equilibrium properties starting from the generalized definition of the entropy , it has been conjectured recently @xcite , however , that the tsallis entropy could be relevant instead in the study of non  equilibrium processes .    due to the difficulty of deriving exact results , it is natural to use numerical methods to obtain the properties of a system with many degrees of freedom when studied under the rules of the new statistics",
    "this is necessary in order to extract results that could be checked against experiments .",
    "however , these studies have been hampered by the failure of the typical monte carlo methods to adequately generate representative equilibrium configurations distributed according to tsallis statistics .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to explain in detail new methods that can be used to study the equilibrium properties of a many  particle system when it is considered under generalized statistics .",
    "although our methods are quite general , we will illustrate their use by considering a prototypical genuinely non  extensive system : the ising ferromagnet model with long  range interactions .",
    "we will also consider the short  range ising model in order to test the simulation methods and to compare the results obtained from the use of tsallis statistics in extensive and non  extensive systems .    in the remaining of the section",
    ", we will outline briefly which are the basic difficulties one encounters when trying to generalize the standard monte carlo methods ( such as the metropolis algorithm ) to the study of tsallis statistics .",
    "the main problem is that the probabilities @xmath8 can not be given an explicit expression , as we will see in the following discussion .",
    "let us consider the canonical ensemble .",
    "the probabilities @xmath8 in this ensemble are found by solving the maximization problem of the entropy @xmath18 as given by eq.([e1 ] ) subject to the constrains of ( i ) positivity : @xmath19 , ( ii ) normalization : @xmath20 and ( iii ) a fixed mean value for the internal energy : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the hamiltonian of the system and the mean value of any function @xmath23 of the microscopic configurations is computed according to the general rule :    @xmath24    @xmath25 is the value of @xmath23 at the configuration whose probability is @xmath4 and we have introduced a function @xmath26 that allows the definition of generalized mean values .",
    "the standard mean values are recovered by taking @xmath27 .",
    "although , initially , the choices @xmath27 ( _ first option _ ) , and @xmath28 ( _ second option _ ) were considered , later , it was shown that a better choice , in the sense that it preserves the legendre structure of the resulting thermodynamics formalism , is to consider @xmath29 ( _ third option _ ) @xcite .",
    "we will use the following notation of the averages in this third option :    @xmath30    @xmath31 are known as the  escorts \" probabilities @xcite .",

    "notice that eq.([e7 ] ) does not give yet the actual values of the probabilities since the @xmath31 s appear in a non  trivial way in both sides of the equation ( either explicitly or in the cut - off condition ) .",
    "this is different from the solution obtained in the usual boltzmann  gibbs canonical ensemble ( recovered in the limit @xmath49 ) in which the solution adopts the explicit form :    @xmath50    ( although , of course , it is very difficult to compute the denominator of this expression , the partition function , for an interacting system ) .",
    "an iterative method to solve eq.([e7 ] ) has been used in @xcite . in this method ,",
    "an initial guess for the probabilities is fed in the right hand side of ( [ e7 ] ) and this equation is used recursively until convergence is achieved .",

    "( [ e5 ] ) and ( [ e2d ] ) one can rewrite this equation as    @xmath54    in terms of @xmath51 the solution adopts a form similar to that of the standard canonical ensemble :    @xmath55^{\\frac q { 1-q } } }    { \\sum_{j } [ 1-(1-q ) \\beta ' \\varepsilon_j]^{\\frac q { 1-q } } } , & { \\rm otherwise } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    one can then adopt the following practical procedure @xcite : choose a value for the parameter @xmath56 and compute the probabilities @xmath34 as a function of @xmath56 using eq.([e9 ] ) .",

    ". finally , vary @xmath56 in order to make the parametric plots @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "other thermodynamic potentials follow the usual definition . for instance , the helmholtz free energy is @xmath60 .",
    "it is important to realize that although the probabilities @xmath34 , when considered as a function of @xmath57 , do not depend on an arbitrary shift @xmath61 of the energy levels or , in other words , do not depend on the zero of energy , @xmath40 , they do depend on @xmath40 when considered as a function of @xmath56 .",
    "this means that the averages as a function of @xmath56 can not be physically relevant _ because they depend on the zero of energy_. this is why @xmath56 has to be interpreted only as an auxiliary parameter , not as an actual temperature .",
    "of course , the relation @xmath62 depends also on the zero of energy in such a way that both dependences cancel and the averages as a function of @xmath57 are independent of a shift in the energy levels .",
    "an interesting question is to determine the range of values for the parameter @xmath56 that should be used in order to obtain the usual range @xmath63 for the temperature @xmath57 . using that",
    ", according to the definition ( [ e1 ] ) , it is @xmath64 we obtain from eq.([e11 ] ) that @xmath56 should vary in the range @xmath65 , where we have used that the energy at zero temperature is the ground state energy @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , it is important to use the right range of values for @xmath56 in order to reach all the possible values for @xmath57 . in particular",
    ", @xmath56 might need to take negative values either for @xmath15 or for @xmath17 unless one adopts @xmath67 as we will throughout this paper . to our understanding ,",
    "it is not clear in the literature the fact that the averages as a function of the parameter @xmath56 depend on the zero of energy and that it might be necessary to consider negative values for @xmath56 in order to span the whole range of values for @xmath57 .    as stated before ,",
    "the main problem to perform tsallis thermostatistics simulations at a given temperature @xmath57 is that there is not an _ explicit _",
    "expression for the probabilities @xmath34 , c.f .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) .",
    "the practical procedure outlined above ( compute @xmath34 as a function of @xmath56 and then compute @xmath35 , @xmath18 and @xmath57 as a function of @xmath56 in order to make parametric plots by varying @xmath56 ) is not straightforward to implement numerically since it is very difficult to use eq.([e5 ] ) to compute the entropy .",
    "this is because the usual monte carlo methods , i.e. the metropolis algorithm , require only the probabilities @xmath34 up to a normalization factor where eq.([e5 ] ) requires the absolute , normalized values of @xmath34 .",
    "it is the object of this paper to explain in detail some numerical methods of the monte carlo type that can be used to perform the necessary averages for generalized statistics , including tsallis .",
    "there have been previous attempts to perform numerical simulations of tsallis statistics using monte carlo methods .",
    "an earlier work in this direction is that of t. penna _ et .",
    "@xcite who extended the metropolis acceptance procedure to include a dependence in the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "however , this method does not satisfy the detailed balance condition which is a key ingredient of monte carlo methods .",
    "another interesting approach is that of i. andricioaei _ et .",
    "@xcite , who performed a metropolis monte carlo algorithm which does satisfy the detailed balance condition for the probability @xmath34 as a function of the parameter @xmath56 but , since they do not make the temperature transformation @xmath68 , they are unable to determine the actual temperature @xmath57 of the simulation .",
    "all these works considered the second version , @xmath28 , for the definition of averages , which , as discussed before , has proven afterwards not to be the optimal election @xcite .",
    "we have used also a similar sampling in the context of simulated annealing @xcite . a recent approach proposed by a. r. lima _ et .",
    "@xcite uses the _ broad histogram monte carlo method _ , which determines the number of microstates using a balance equation between near neighbor energy levels .",
    "they are able to apply this method to the ising model with short  range interactions .",
    "this is a valid monte carlo simulation with full control of the temperature @xmath57 but its applicability is somewhat restricted . as we will show , the ising model with long  range interactions can not be treated straightforwardly with this method because the spin flip dynamics does not produce transitions between near energy levels and , consequently , the broad histogram monte carlo method , in its present form , can not be used to study long  range interacting systems .",
    "we are able to overcome these difficulties by extending a method which had been developed some time ago @xcite to compute directly the number of states with a given energy and which does not depend on the definition of the entropy .",
    "in fact , our method can be used to study any statistics and applications will be shown both for the boltzmann  gibbs and the tsallis statistics .",
    "we develop yet a second method which is devised specifically for the tsallis statistics and that has the advantage that it uses the familiar metropolis algorithm plus a numerical integration .",
    "this paper is organized in the following form : in section [ s2 ] we use a simple and limited enumeration procedure valid only for small system sizes .",
    "however , this method is exact and can be used to check against some of the approximated methods we will introduce later . in this section we also introduce the short  range ising model ( srim ) and the long  range ising model ( lrim ) .",
    "these two models will be employed in this paper in order to test the numerical methods described here and to compare the behavior of the non  extensive tsallis thermostatistics in genuinely extensive and non  extensive systems . in section [ s4 ] we explain in some detail the histogram by overlapping windows ( how ) method .",
    "we show that this method has a wide range of applicability since it can be used both for short  range and long  range systems as well as for any kind of statistics .",
    "section [ s3 ] presents a metropolis monte carlo type method specially devised to study systems in the tsallis statistics . in section [ s5 ]",
    "we present some results concerning the validity of some scaling relations for the srim and lrim in the tsallis thermostatistics context .",
    "these scaling relations are an extension of the ones holding for the boltzmann  gibbs statistics . in section [ s6 ] we present results for these models using standard mean values instead of those defined by eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) . in section [ s7 ]",
    "we discuss the results of using tsallis statistics in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "finally , in section [ s8 ] we summarize the main conclusions of this work .",
    "the problem to compute the probabilities @xmath31 using eq.([e9 ] ) is that the number of terms in the sum of the denominator of this equation , the number of microstate configurations @xmath69 , is extremely large ( typically scales exponentially with the system size ) .",
    "however , for small systems , it might be possible to enumerate completely the microstates and , therefore , to compute magnitudes of interest such as the internal energy @xmath58 , the entropy @xmath59 , the free energy @xmath70 , etc .",
    "we follow this approach in this section .",
    "although the system sizes one can usually study with this method are very far from reaching a situation in which scaling laws with system size apply , we use the results as a bench - test in order to compare with other approximate methods that will be introduced in the following sections .",
    "we will consider ising type models with hamiltonian :    @xmath71    where each of the @xmath0 spin variables @xmath72 , @xmath73 can take the values @xmath74 .",
    "the sum @xmath75 runs over all distinct pairs of sites on a @xmath76-dimensional regular lattice of linear size @xmath77 with periodic boundary conditions and lattice constant equal to @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath79 is the coupling parameter between spins @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "note that for ferromagnetic couplings , @xmath82 , the ground state is double degenerate and its energy is @xmath67 .",
    "the usual , nearest  neighbors , or short  range ising model ( srim ) ,",
    "is obtained taking @xmath83 , if @xmath84 and @xmath85 , if @xmath86 . the long  range ising model ( lrim )",
    "is defined by using    @xmath87    where @xmath88 is the distance between the spins @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and the parameter @xmath37 sets the interaction range .",
    "the srim is formally recovered by taking the limit @xmath89 .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath37 and the space dimension @xmath76 , the lrim has two regimes : the extensive regime , @xmath90 , and the non  extensive regime , @xmath91 .",
    "this can be seen by roughly estimating the mean energy per spin in an infinite system as @xmath92 .",
    "we obtain a convergent integral if @xmath90 ( extensive behavior ) , and for @xmath93 the integral diverges ( non  extensive ) .",
    "more precisely , a convenient scale for the mean energy per spin in a finite system of size @xmath0 is given by @xcite :    @xmath94    the definition of @xmath95 is such that the limit @xmath96 is well defined .",
    "again , we see that for @xmath90 the internal energy per spin scales as a constant in the limit of large @xmath0 , but for @xmath97 , it grows with the system size .",
    "the system is , in this latter case , genuinely non  extensive .",
    "the srim limit , @xmath89 , gives the expected result @xmath98 .",
    "the number of configurations in the ising model is @xmath99 .",
    "we have made a complete enumeration of the @xmath5 configurations and their energies @xmath42 for a linear chain , @xmath100 , of sizes up to @xmath101 .",
    "we have used these results to compute the probabilities @xmath34 and then the thermodynamic magnitudes of interest using tsallis statistics with the third option for the averages . in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , we plot the exact internal energy @xmath35 as a function of the temperature @xmath57 , for several values of the parameter @xmath1 for the lrim in a genuinely non  extensive situation , @xmath102 , fig . [ f1].b , and for the srim , fig .",
    "[ f1].a . in the @xmath15 case",
    "we observe that there is a range of temperatures for which the internal energy is not a single  valued function of the temperature and , for a given value of @xmath57 , there are several possible values for @xmath35 .",
    "this ambiguity is resolved by using a maxwell  like construction @xcite that replaces the loop in the energy curves by a vertical straight line connecting the two points with the same free energy @xmath70 .",
    "we stress that the loops in the energy curves appear as a result of the @xmath62 transformation and , therefore , will not be observed when plotting the energy as a function of @xmath56 .",
    "typical @xmath68 transformations are shown in fig .",
    "we observe in this figure that for @xmath15 a same value of @xmath56 can correspond , in some cases , to three or more values of @xmath57 giving rise to the observed multivalued behavior in the energy .",
    "figure [ f2 ] helps us to understand the failure of the iterative method that has been proposed @xcite to solve the set of equations ( [ e7 ] ) .",
    "although each value of @xmath56 defines a unique set @xmath31 .",
    "we see fig .",
    "[ f2 ] that for @xmath17 there are some intervals of @xmath56 where the transformation @xmath68 is almost horizontal . therefore , one value of @xmath57 corresponds nearly to a complete interval for @xmath56 and hence , there are many possible solutions for @xmath31 very close to the real one .",
    "this is the main reason for the failure of iterative methods for @xmath17 .",
    "the situation worsens for increasing system size @xmath0 .    whatever illuminating the method of exact enumeration is , its validity is limited to very small values for @xmath0 . to our knowledge , the largest value ever considered in an exact enumeration scheme for a short  range ising model is @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "simulations at larger @xmath0 sizes require other methods , as the ones presented in the next two sections .",
    "although the number of possible microscopic configurations is in general very large , the range of possible energy values usually takes a much smaller value . for instance , for the one  dimensional srim introduced in the previous section , with @xmath0 spins we have @xmath99 , but the number of possible energy values is @xmath104 .",
    "let @xmath105 , in general , be the number of possible energy levels .",
    "we denote by @xmath106 the number of microscopic states sharing the same energy @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",

    "moreover , it is also trivial to compute the averages for any value of the parameters , say @xmath57 or @xmath1",
    ". therefore , although the calculation of the @xmath111 s might be time consuming , the pay  off is tremendous .    in general ,",
    "the @xmath106 are very difficult to obtain exactly .",
    "an important exception that will be used throughout this paper is the srim in 1-d , for which the energy levels are given by @xmath112 for @xmath113 and whose degeneracy is :    @xmath114    in the cases in which @xmath106 is not known we need approximate numerical methods .",
    "the most naive way to find the @xmath106 s is to generate different system configurations randomly and count how many times a configuration with energy @xmath107 appears .",
    "however , this approach fails because the complete set of @xmath106 values span too many orders of magnitude . in general , two energy levels @xmath107 and @xmath115 could differ as much as @xmath116 .",
    "this means that the range of variation of @xmath106 over the @xmath105 different energy levels is very large and it is not possible to generate in a single run a histogram that covers all the energy levels , unless one generates a number of configurations of the order of the total number available to the system , @xmath69 .",
    "the histogram by overlapping windows method ( how ) used here @xcite avoids this problem by generating system configurations within a restricted energy interval and estimating the relative weights of these energy levels from the number of times they appear in each interval . by generating enough intervals spanning the whole energy range ,",
    "one is able to obtain good quality estimators of the numbers @xmath106 .",
    "an earlier account of the method has been given in @xcite and we explain now in some detail how the method works .",
    "let us consider first the srim in arbitrary dimension .",
    "in this case , the possible energy values are @xmath112 for @xmath117 .",
    "following the original work @xcite , we consider the intervals ( windows ) @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , etc .",
    "each window consists of @xmath121 consecutive energy levels and the last energy value of one window is the first of the next one . the next step is to take one of the intervals and to generate configurations whose energy belongs to it .",
    "this is achieved , after preparing the system initially with one of the energies of the interval , by flipping spins chosen at random .",
    "a spin flip is accepted only if it leaves the system in one of the energy levels of the interval and it is rejected otherwise .",
    "the ratio of the number of generated states with energy @xmath107 to the number of generated states with energy @xmath115 is an unbiased estimator of @xmath122 , for @xmath107 and @xmath115 within the energy window .",
    "the quality of the estimator increases with the number of generated configurations . from the overlap between windows",
    "one can compute @xmath106 for the whole range of energies .",
    "the number of energy values in each window ( @xmath121 in the previous example ) is not important as far as it is not too large ( such that the ratios @xmath122 are not extremely small or large ) and it is not too small either .",
    "if the window is very small , most spin flips will yield an energy outside the range of allowed values and the number of accepted , i.e. independent , configurations will be very small .",
    "moreover , the final algorithm must be ergodic : any energy value in a window should be obtained from any other value in the same window after a sufficient number of spin flips .",
    "the same basic idea has been used in other short  range hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "we are concerned now with the extension of this method to consider long  range interactions , in particular the lrim introduced before .",
    "a modification needed is that the energy values @xmath107 will represent now a continuum set of energies with a bin size @xmath123 .",
    "the energy levels are then @xmath124 @xmath125 and @xmath106 counts all the configurations @xmath80 whose energy @xmath42 satisfies @xmath126 . in other words , one makes the approximation of considering that all the energies lying in one bin count as one single level .",
    "this turns out not to be a critical point , although one has to check that the results are independent , within the simulation errors , of the magnitude of @xmath123 .",
    "a more important point concerns the optimal size @xmath127 of the energy window @xmath128 . since , for a long  range interacting system , a single spin flip can produce a very large change in the energy , it is important not to choose @xmath127 too small . to make this point clear , we have calculated exactly the number of states @xmath106 for a system with @xmath101 by using the complete enumeration of the @xmath129 possibles configurations , see fig .",
    "[ f3 ] . using these exact results we study the energy changes that a single spin flip makes both in the srim and the lrim cases .",
    "a typical situation is shown in fig.[f4 ] . in this figure",
    "we plot the histogram of the ( exact ) number of configurations using a value for the bin @xmath130 for the srim , and @xmath131 for the lrim .",
    "we select several configurations belonging to one of the energy bins ( marked black in the figure ) and we dash all the levels that are obtained from these configurations by flipping one spin .",
    "we see that , as expected , the change in energy for the srim brings the system to one of its neighboring energy levels",
    ". however , for the lrim the energy changes are very large and , in fact , the nearest  neighbor energy levels can not be reached by using the spin flip dynamics @xcite . a measure of the typical change in energy obtained when flipping one spin is estimated by considering the ferromagnetic ground state configuration with all the spins pointing in the same direction .",
