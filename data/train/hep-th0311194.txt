    "in a previous paper @xcite , we took the first step towards constructing a renormalizable effective potential for the local composite operator ( lco ) @xmath2 in linear covariant gauges .",
    "it was shown within the algebraic renormalization formalism @xcite that @xmath3 is multiplicatively renormalizable to all orders in perturbation theory . at the same time , the anomalous dimension of @xmath3 was explicitly computed to 2-loops in the @xmath4 scheme as a function of the gauge fixing parameter , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 corresponds to the landau gauge .",
    "the computation exploited the fact that in linear covariant gauges the operator does not mix , for example , with ghost operators of dimension two with the same quantum numbers .",
    "the operator @xmath3 has recently received widespread interest in yang - mills theory in the landau gauge .",
    "its relevance has been advocated both from a theoretical point of view as well as from lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "analytic results in favour of a non - zero value for the condensate @xmath7 in the landau gauge have been obtained recently , @xcite .",
    "further , the inclusion of quarks has been considered in @xcite .",
    "motivated by the result of @xcite it has been shown in @xcite that @xmath3 is multiplicatively renormalizable to all orders in the landau gauge , but its anomalous dimension is given by a combination of the gauge beta function , @xmath8 , and the anomalous dimension , @xmath9 , of the gluon field , according to the relation @xcite @xmath10 an important consequence of the formation of the @xmath11 condensate in the landau gauge is the dynamical generation of a gluon mass @xmath12mev @xcite .",
    "lattice simulations of the @xmath13 gluon propagator in the landau gauge report @xmath14mev , @xcite .",
    "gluon masses have also been extracted from lattice methods in the laplacian @xcite and maximal abelian gauges @xcite .",
    "earlier the pairing of gluons was discussed in connection with mass generation as a result of the instability of the perturbative yang - mills vacuum @xcite .",
    "a dynamical gluon mass might also be important , for example , in connection with the glueball spectra , @xcite .",
    "a dimension two gluon condensate @xmath15 was already introduced in @xcite , where the coulomb gauge was considered .",
    "furthermore , a dynamical gluon mass is part of a certain criterion for confinement introduced by kugo and ojima , @xcite . for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "it is no coincidence that the landau gauge is employed in the search for a gluon condensate of mass dimension two .",
    "as is well known , there does not exist a local , gauge - invariant operator of mass dimension two in yang - mills theories .",
    "however , a _",
    "non - local _ gauge invariant dimension two operator can be constructed by minimizing @xmath3 along each gauge orbit @xcite , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the space time volume and @xmath18 is a generic @xmath19 transformation .",
    "this operator @xmath20 is related to the so - called fundamental modular region ( fmr ) , which is the set of absolute minima of @xmath21 . in the landau gauge ,",
    "@xmath22 , so that @xmath23 and @xmath3 coincide within the fmr .",
    "as such , a gauge invariant meaning can indeed be attached to @xmath11 in the landau gauge , as it was also expressed in @xcite .",
    "another interesting property of the landau gauge is that the operator @xmath3 is brst invariant on - shell .",
    "if one considered alternative gauges to the landau gauge , one could search for a class of gauges in which the operator @xmath3 can be generalized to a mass dimension two operator while maintaining the on - shell brst invariance .",
    "doing so , one should consider a class of non - linear covariant gauges , which are the so - called curci - ferrari gauges @xcite , where @xmath3 is generalized to the mixed gluon - ghost operator @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the latter operator is indeed brst invariant on - shell @xcite , and has been proven to be multiplicatively renormalizable to all orders @xcite , and to give rise to a dynamical gluon mass in the curci - ferrari gauge @xcite .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , the physical meaning of @xmath24 was discussed , based on on - shell brst invariance .    in the maximal abelian gauge , which is a renormalizable gauge in the continuum @xcite , one should consider the operator @xmath25 where the group index @xmath26 labels the off - diagonal generators of @xmath19 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the gauge parameter of the maximal abelian gauge .",
    "this operator also enjoys the property of being both brst invariant on - shell @xcite and multiplicatively renormalizable to all orders @xcite .",
    "although the effective potential for the condensate @xmath29 has not yet been obtained , we expect it to have a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value , which would result in a dynamical mass for the off - diagonal gluons .",
    "this is based on the close similarity between the maximal abelian gauge and the curci - ferrari gauge and hence the results of @xcite .",
    "more commonly , the landau gauge is a special case of the well known linear covariant gauges .",
    "although the operator @xmath3 is not even brst invariant on - shell in these gauges , it is still renormalizable to any order in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that , thanks to the additional shift symmetry , @xmath30 , of the antighost in the linear covariant gauges , the composite operator @xmath3 does not mix into the dimension two ghost operator @xmath31 . in this article , we will construct the effective potential for the dimension two condensate @xmath11 in linear gauges and show that a non - vanishing value of @xmath7 is energetically favourable , resulting in dynamical gluon mass generation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review the local composite operators formalism and explicitly calculate the 1-loop effective potential . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss the gauge parameter independence of the vacuum energy which requires an extension of the lco formalism .",
    "the behaviour of the gluon propagator is discussed briefly in section 4 whilst we provide concluding comments in section 5 .",
    "we begin with the yang - mills action in linear covariant gauges @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the covariant derivate in the adjoint representation . in order to study the local composite operator @xmath3",
    ", we introduce it into the action by means of a brst  doublet @xcite of external sources @xmath34 , namely @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the brst  nilpotent operator acting as @xmath37 according to the local composite operator technique @xcite , the dimensionless parameter @xmath38 is needed to account for the divergences present in the vacuum green function @xmath39 , which turn out to be proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "as is apparent from the expressions ( [ sym ] ) and ( [ sj ] ) , the action @xmath41 is brst invariant @xmath42 as was shown in @xcite , the action @xmath43 enjoys the property of being multiplicatively renormalizable to all orders of perturbation theory .    to obtain the effective potential , we set the source @xmath44 to zero and consider the renormalized generating functional @xmath45\\exp is(j)\\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the relevant fields and @xmath48 is the usual counterterm contribution . also , @xmath49 is the counterterm accounting for the divergences proportional to @xmath50 .",
    "the bare quantities are given by @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the functional @xmath54 obeys the renormalization group equation ( rge ) @xmath55 where @xmath56 from the bare lagrangian , we infer that @xmath57 where we will use dimensional regularization throughout with the convention that @xmath58 .",
    "hence @xmath59 with @xmath60 now , we are faced with the problem of the hitherto arbitrary parameter @xmath38 .",
    "as explained in @xcite , setting @xmath61 would give rise to an inhomogeneous rge for @xmath54 @xmath62 and a non - linear rge for the effective action @xmath63 for the composite operator @xmath3 .",
    "this problem can be overcome by making @xmath38 a function of @xmath64 and @xmath5 so that , if @xmath64 runs according to @xmath65 and @xmath5 according to @xmath66 , @xmath67 will run according to ( [ rge6 ] ) .",
    "this is accomplished by setting @xmath38 equal to the solution of the differential equation @xmath68 since @xmath67 now automatically runs according to its rge , @xmath54 obeys the homogeneous renormalization group equation @xmath69 the final step in the formal construction of the effective potential for @xmath7 is the removal of the @xmath50 terms from the lagrangian by means of a renormalized hubbard - stratonovich transformation . by this procedure , the energy interpretation of the effective action is made explicit again and the conventional 1pi machinery applies .",
    "we insert unity written as @xmath70\\exp\\left[i\\int d^{4}x\\left(-\\frac{1}{2z_\\zeta\\zeta}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{g}-z_2\\frac{a_\\mu^2}{2}-z_\\zeta\\zeta j\\right)^{2}\\right)\\right]\\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath71 the appropriate normalization factor , in ( [ d1 ] ) to arrive at the lagrangian @xmath72 while @xmath73\\exp is_\\sigma(j)\\;,\\\\ \\label{rge13bis}s_\\sigma(j)&=&\\int d^4x\\left(\\mathcal{l}(a_\\mu,\\sigma)+j\\frac{\\sigma}{g}\\right)\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , the source @xmath74 appears as a linear source term for @xmath75 . from ( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ rge13 ] ) ,",
    "one has the following identification @xmath76 where we will not write the renormalization factors from now on .",
    "this equation states that the gauge condensate @xmath11 is related to the expectation value of the field @xmath77 , evaluated with the new action , @xmath78 , of ( [ rge12 ] ) .",
    "although we have not considered the contribution from ( massless ) quark fields in the previous analysis , it can be checked that the results remain unchanged if matter fields are included .",
    "firstly , we will determine the renormalization group function @xmath79 as defined in ( [ rge7 ] ) .",
    "all the following results will be within the @xmath4 scheme .",
    "the value for @xmath65 can be found in the literature . in @xmath80 dimensions , one has @xmath81 where the casimirs of the colour group are defined by @xmath82  @xmath83  @xmath84 , @xmath85  @xmath83  @xmath86 , @xmath87  @xmath83  @xmath88 and @xmath89 is the number of quark flavours . for @xmath66",
    ", we use the relation @xmath90 .",
    "the anomalous dimension @xmath91 of the gluon field in linear covariant gauges was calculated at three loops in @xmath4 in @xcite .",
    "adapting that result to our convention , the anomalous dimension of the gauge parameter is @xmath92 the anomalous dimension , @xmath93 , of the composite operator @xmath3 was calculated in @xcite and reads @xmath94\\;,\\nonumber\\\\ \\gamma_1&=&\\frac{1}{24}\\frac{1}{\\left(16\\pi^2\\right)^2}\\left [ \\left ( 449 + 33\\alpha + 18\\alpha ^{2}\\right ) c_{a}^{2}-280c_{a}t_{f}n_{\\!f}-192c_{f}t_{f}n_{\\!f}\\right]\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to determine @xmath79 , we still require the counterterm @xmath49 . in principle , this can be directly calculated from the divergences in @xmath54 when the propagator for a gluon with mass @xmath74 is used .",
    "however , a less cumbersome way to compute @xmath49 was described in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the fact that the divergences arise in the @xmath95 term and therefore that part of the green s function which contains these divergences is equivalent to the green s function with a double insertion of the @xmath96 operator . more specifically , one has two external @xmath74 insertions with a non - zero momentum flowing into one insertion where the only internal couplings are those of the usual qcd action .",
    "moreover , one does not require massive propagators but instead can use massless fields which simplifies the calculation .",
    "therefore one is reduced to computing a massless two - point function for which the mincer algorithm , @xcite , was designed .",
    "we used the version written in form , @xcite , where the feynman diagrams are generated by qgraf , @xcite , to determine the divergence structure to three loops .",
    "although we only require the result to two loops the extra loop evaluation in fact acts as a non - trivial check on the two loop result .",
    "this is because the emergence of the correct double and triple poles in @xmath97 at three loops , in a way which is consistent with the renormalization group , verifies that the single and double poles of the two loop expression for @xmath98 are correct .",

    "assemblying our results leads to @xmath101 as a check we see that @xmath79 contains no poles for @xmath102 .",
    "further , the expressions ( [ rge19 ] ) lead to the same results which were obtained earlier in the case of the landau gauge ( @xmath6 ) , as can be inferred from @xcite without quarks and @xcite with quarks .    from the renormalization group functions ( [ rge15 ] ) , ( [ rge16 ] ) , ( [ rge17 ] ) and ( [ rge19 ] ) , it is easy to see that the equation ( [ rge9 ] ) can be solved for by expanding @xmath67 in a laurent series as @xmath103 substituting this expression in equation ( [ rge9 ] ) , we obtain @xmath104 thus ( [ rge21a ] ) gives @xmath105 with @xmath106 a constant of integration . as a consequence of the already rather complicated structure of @xmath107 , we will determine @xmath108 without quarks present corresponding to @xmath109 since the expression for @xmath108 with @xmath110 is several pages long .",

    "we also see that @xmath138 becomes rapidly larger and @xmath139 becomes rapidly more and more negative as @xmath140 gets more negative .",
    "a more urgent problem is the fact that the vacuum energy @xmath139 depends on the gauge parameter @xmath5 .",

    "one possible explanation as to why @xmath139 depends on @xmath5 could reside in the values of the constants of integration @xmath106 and @xmath112 we have chosen . with another choice for these constants",

    ", we should solve the following equation @xmath143 in terms of @xmath106 and @xmath112 .",
    "however , the solutions of this equation depend on @xmath140 , and this is not allowed since @xmath106 and @xmath112 should be @xmath140 independent constants .",
    "this means that the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath139 can not be eliminated by a suitable choice of @xmath106 and @xmath112 .",

    "as such , its vacuum expectation value vanishes .",
    "this is the usual argument to prove the gauge parameter independence in the brst framework @xcite . of course ,",
    "this is based on the assumption that the brst symmetry is not broken .",
    "notice therefore that there does not exist an operator @xmath150 with @xmath151 , so that a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value for the condensate @xmath11 does not break the brst invariance .",
    "indeed , from @xmath152 one can easily check that @xmath153 so that we have a brst invariant @xmath154-action .",
    "the rest of the argument is based on the fact that @xmath155 when the vacuum is considered , so that we are left with only the brst exact term in ( [ rge36 ] ) .",
    "more formally , the effective action @xmath156 is related to @xmath157 through a legendre transformation @xmath158 the effective potential @xmath159 is then defined as @xmath160 let @xmath161 be the solution of @xmath162 since @xmath163 one finds @xmath164 and invoking ( [ rge43 ] ) , from ( [ rge40 ] ) and ( [ rge41 ] ) we derive @xmath165 finally , combining ( [ rge36 ] ) and ( [ rge44 ] ) @xmath166 from this , we conclude that the vacuum energy @xmath139 should be independent of the gauge parameter @xmath5 .    apparently , our explicit result ( [ rge31 ] ) for @xmath139 is not in agreement with the above proof that @xmath139 is the same for each @xmath5 .",
    "if we examine the proof in more detail we notice that a key argument is that @xmath74 becomes zero at the end of the calculation . in practice , this is achieved by solving the gap equation . now , in a power series expansion in the coupling",
    "constant , the derivative of the effective potential with respect to @xmath154 is something of the form @xmath167 where we assume that we work up to order @xmath64 and that we have chosen @xmath121 so that the logarithms vanish .",
    "then , the gap equation corresponding to ( [ rge46 ] ) reads @xmath168 due to ( [ rge41 ] ) and ( [ rge42bis ] ) , one also has @xmath169 this means that , if we solve the gap equation ( [ rge47 ] ) up to certain order , we have @xmath170 we also have @xmath171 so , working to the order we are considering @xmath172 from the square of the gap equation ( [ rge47 ] ) , @xmath173 it follows that @xmath174 we see that , if one consistently works to the order we are considering , terms such as @xmath175 do not equal zero although @xmath155 to that order .",
    "terms like those on the right hand side of ( [ rge52 ] ) are cancelled by terms which are formally of higher order .",
    "this has its consequences for the terms proportional to @xmath74 in ( [ rge36 ] ) .",
    "if one were able to work to infinite order , the problem would not arise .",
    "however , we do not have this ability , and we are faced with a gauge parameter dependence slipping into @xmath139 .      we could resolve this issue by saying that the gauge parameter dependence of the vacuum energy should become less and less severe as we go to higher orders , and that eventually it will drop out if we go to infinite order .",
    "however , this is not very satisfactory , especially since we can surely never calculate the potential up to infinite order . also as is clear from the quite complicated expression for @xmath176 , which will enter the differential equation for @xmath177 , a 2-loop evaluation of the effective potential is already out of the question .",
    "therefore , we could try to modify the lco formalism in order to circumvent the gauge parameter dependence of @xmath139 .",

    "we will determine @xmath197 so that @xmath205 .",
    "this amounts to choosing @xmath206 .",
    "we can justify this choice based on our remark in the introduction , which is that @xmath3 coincides with the gauge invariant quantity @xmath23 in the landau gauge in the fmr . since our calculation is based on a perturbative expansion around @xmath207 , which lies within the fmr , we stay within the fmr @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the differential equation ( [ rge66 ] ) is very hard to solve analytically",
    ". we could solve ( [ rge66 ] ) and consequently @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 numerically .",
    "however , there is a more elegant way to obtain the analytical solution for @xmath197 . considering the colour group @xmath130 for simplicity , then since we know that by construction that @xmath141 , we are able to write down the analytical solution for @xmath138 as @xmath208 where use was made of ( [ rge32c ] ) and ( [ rge65c ] ) . putting ( [ rge67 ] ) in ( [ rge65b ] ) , we deduce that @xmath209 combining ( [ rge65a ] ) and ( [ rge68 ] ) finally gives the analytic expression for @xmath210 @xmath211 we have displayed @xmath197 , @xmath212 and @xmath213 for the range of values @xmath214",
    "@xmath215  @xmath5  @xmath215  @xmath216 in figures 4 - 6 . as a check ,",
    "we have also plotted , in figure 7 , @xmath217 as given in ( [ rge65c ] ) to verify that @xmath218 .",
    "we observe several features .",
    "firstly , although @xmath197 has some singularities in @xmath219-\\frac{13}{3},\\frac{13}{3}\\right[$ ] , the quantities @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 are completely regular functions of @xmath5 .",
    "secondly , the expansion parameter @xmath137 remains relatively small , which makes our numerical predictions at least qualitatively trustworthy .",
    "thirdly , we also see that the value for the tree level mass does not change spectacularly in the considered region . in the feynman gauge @xmath220",
    ", we have @xmath221 .    [ fig10 ]    [ fig11 ]    [ fig12 ]    [ fig13 ]    before ending this section , there are several other points .",
    "we have determined @xmath222 with the renormalization scale @xmath121 chosen in such a way that the logarithms vanish .",
    "other choices of @xmath121 are of course also valid .",
    "we did not explicitly write this @xmath121 dependence of @xmath222 in ( [ rge54 ] ) .",
    "also , the procedure we have described here applies of course at higher order .",
    "for example , at 2-loops , @xmath223 will be required to remove the @xmath5 dependence .",
    "if we were to work to infinite order in @xmath64 , we could transform the action @xmath224 ( [ rge53 ] ) _ exactly _ into the action @xmath145 ( [ d2 ] ) by means of the transformation @xmath225 the corresponding transformation for the @xmath154 and @xmath189 fields reads @xmath226 which will transform the effective potential @xmath227 _ exactly _ into @xmath228 . as such , the constructed vacuum energy will be the same in both cases and independent of the choice of @xmath5 .",
    "in @xcite , the gluon propagator in the landau was investigated , and a fit of the lattice results gave evidence for a gluon mass . in the landau gauge , the lattice also gives evidence for the existence of a non - zero @xmath11 condensate , based on the discrepancy in the 10 gev region , between the behaviour of the observed lattice gluon propagator and strong coupling constant and the expected perturbative behaviour .",
    "the results could be matched together using an operator product expansion analysis with a non - zero @xmath7 condensate @xcite .",
    "a combined lattice fit resulted in @xmath229 .",
    "this quantity was obtained at a scale of 10 gev in the mom renormalization scheme .",
    "later , it was argued that this @xmath230 condensate could be explained with instantons @xcite .",
    "one will notice that we did not give the estimate for @xmath231 itself . from the identification ( [ rge14 ] ) and using the relation ( [ rge25 ] ) and the explicit result ( [ rge32b ] ) , one finds @xmath232 the extra minus sign arises because we have rotated from minkowskian to euclidean space time to make possible a comparison with the lattice .",
    "we used @xmath233 , which was the value obtained in @xcite .",
    "we should be careful not to misinterpret the relatively big difference between @xmath230 and ( [ invoegsel ] ) .",
    "although our result is non - perturbative in nature , it is still obtained in perturbation theory and as such it only gives information from the high energy region ( or short range ) , while the ope approach of boucaud _ et al _ can only describe the low energy ( or long range ) content of @xmath234 .",
    "it was already argued in @xcite that @xmath235 can receive long and short range contributions .",
    "the minus sign in front of our result has to do with the regularization and renormalization of the quantity @xmath236 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details .    to our knowledge ,",
    "there has been little attention on the lattice to the gluon propagator in a general linear covariant gauge .",
    "et al _ managed to put the linear covariant gauge on the lattice @xcite .",
    "the tree level gluon propagator of euclidean yang - mills theory with a linear covariant gauge fixing is given by @xmath237 this can be decomposed into the transverse and longitudinal parts as @xmath238 where @xmath239 is @xmath240 times the one used in @xcite .",
    "in general , one determines @xmath241 via the projector @xmath242 if there is a tree level gluon mass @xmath138 present , as in ( [ rge58 ] ) , the euclidean gluon propagator in linear covariant gauges reads @xmath243 with the value of @xmath138 given in ( [ rge67 ] ) .",
    "the longitudinal part of this propagator is @xmath244 @xmath241 is plotted in figure 8 , again using @xmath233 .",
    "[ fig15 ]    of course , we should not attach any firm meaning to this plot , since we are only considering the tree level propagator and do not include any renormalization effects . if we could calculate the form factors , we would also inevitably encounter the problem of a diverging perturbation theory in the infrared region .",
    "we can not make any conclusion about the behaviour of the propagator in the ir from the above .",
    "many other ( non - perturbative ) effects can influence the propagators form in the ir .",
    "nevertheless , it might be worth noticing that the longitudinal part @xmath241 is not proportional to the gauge parameter .",
    "a similar behaviour was found by giusti _",
    "et al _ , see e.g. figure 4 of @xcite .",
    "this is already different from the perturbative prediction of massless yang - mills theory with a linear covariant gauge fixing @xcite .",
    "we have considered yang - mills theories in linear covariant gauges and constructed a renormalizable effective potential by means of the local composite operator formalism for @xmath3 .",
    "the formation of the gluon condensate of mass dimension two is favoured since it lowers the vacuum energy . as a result , the gluons acquire a dynamical mass @xmath138 .",
    "we discussed the gauge parameter dependence of the resultant vacuum energy and observed that this is due to the fact that we do not work up to infinite order precision , but have to truncate the perturbative expansion at a finite order .",
    "we explained how this gauge parameter dependence can be avoided by a modification of our method .",
    "although there is limited lattice data available for the general linear covariant gauges compared with the landau gauge , it would be interesting to calculate the form factor of the longitudinal and transverse part of the gluon propagator to make a more detailed comparison possible with the lattice results of @xcite .",
    "it would also be useful to have direct evidence from the lattice community that the @xmath7 condensate exists and that the gluons become massive , in analogy with the landau gauge .",
    "a further point worth investigating is the possible existence of ghost condensates in the linear covariant gauges , as is the case in the landau gauge @xcite .",
    "these condensates can modify the gluon propagator further .",
