    "conformal field theories ( cfts ) have played central roles in theoretical physics since they lie at the endpoints of generic renormalization group ( rg ) flows . in the study of critical phenomena , it is crucial to understand what kind of fixed points are present with the desired symmetries ( see e.g. @xcite@xcite ) . within hamiltonian ( lagrangian )",
    "approaches there have been several methods proposed to investigate the problem both perturbatively ( such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 expansions ; see e.g. @xcite ) and non - perturbatively ( such as monte - carlo simulations ) , but they may suffer questions of validity and numerical costs .",
    "recently we have seen substantial progress in understanding higher dimensional cfts via the conformal bootstrap program @xcite@xcite . without using an explicit form of the hamiltonian",
    ", it provides us with rigorous but non - trivial constraints on spectra of conformal dimensions and operator product expansion ( ope ) coefficients @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the information encoded in the conformal bootstrap allows us to `` re - discover '' non - trivial cfts and reproduces known critical exponents @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . from our experience",
    ", we are convinced that there exist a certain class of cfts that occupy the extreme corners of the conformal bootstrap constraints although the fundamental reason is not obvious to us yet .    in this letter",
    "we study @xmath9 symmetric cfts in space - time dimension @xmath1 with particular emphasis on the @xmath5 cases . the motivation for this choice of symmetry group is twofold .",
    "firstly , these symmetries are realized in condensed - matter systems like frustrated spin models with non - collinear order @xcite@xcite .",
    "secondly , @xmath9-symmetric landau - ginzburg models have richer dynamical structures than @xmath10 vector models .",
    "there is a long - standing debate whether the frustrated spin systems in non - colinear order show the first order phase transition or the second order phase transition . if the @xmath9 symmetric landau - ginzburg models do not posse non - trivial fixed points other than the @xmath11 symmetric heisernberg fixed point , the second order phase transition is impossible . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence of the stable @xmath9 symmetric fixed point suggests the strong evidence for the second order phase transition if the system is inside the attraction domain of the rg flow .",
    "when we study the rg flow of the @xmath0 symmetric landau - ginzburg models with the hamiltonian @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 , we find that for a sufficiently large ratio @xmath4 , there are two - more fixed points in addition to gaussian ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath11 heisenberg ( @xmath16 ) fixed points , which are named chiral ( stable ) and anti - chiral ( unstable ) ones @xcite@xcite ( see fig.[fig : rg ] ) . in perturbative approaches ,",
    "the existence of these additional fixed points was established for large @xmath2 limit with fixed @xmath3 @xcite , but the situations for smaller @xmath2 was unsettled and controversial @xcite @xcite@xcite , so it is desirable to see if we can find any indications of these additional fixed points in the conformal bootstrap program without using the explicit form of the hamiltonian . in this letter",
    ", we will indeed show strong evidence that for sufficiently large @xmath4 , the theories at these fixed points solve the conformal bootstrap constraints at their extreme corners as in @xcite@xcite but in different ope sectors .",
    "furthermore we will predict the edge of the conformal window for @xmath17 anti - chiral fixed points .",
    "landau - ginzburg models with sufficiently large @xmath2 . in the present figure , @xmath18 and the @xmath19-functions are taken from section 3 of @xcite .",
    ", width=302 ]    our careful choice of @xmath5 is to establish the usefulness of the conformal bootstrap program to determine the edge of the conformal window in less controversial situations @xcite while still finding the conjecture from the other methods before we venture into the the most controversial cases of @xmath20 with smaller @xmath2 .",
    "note that @xmath5 cases are not necessarily unrealistic ( compared e.g. with @xmath21 ) . as reviewed in @xcite ,",
    "when the frustrated spins align three - dimensionally , the system admits the @xmath22 symmetry .",
    "let us begin with cfts with no continuous global symmetry .",
    "the strategy of the conformal bootstrap program is to constrain cfts from their fundamental properties such as conformal invariance , unitarity and crossing symmetry . specifically , we demand these properties in the four - point function of identical scalar primary operators , @xmath23 the crossing relation gives a sum rule in terms of ope coefficients and conformal blocks .",
    "after truncation to a finite dimensional convex optimization problem , we find an upper bound for the conformal dimension of the lowest - dimensional operator ( other than the unit operator ) of definite spin appearing in @xmath24 ope .",
    "repeating this procedure by changing the conformal dimension @xmath25 of the external scalar operator , we obtain a critical curve @xmath26 with @xmath27 being the spin of the operator .",
    "the behavior of @xmath28 is summarized as : for space - time dimensions @xmath29 , it shows a discontinuity in its slope , and the location of such a `` kink '' corresponds to the wilson - fisher fixed point .",
    "the singular behavior of @xmath28 knows the existence of a non - trivial cft .",
    "let us now consider the cft with an additional symmetry group @xmath30 .",
    "we study the four - point function of scalar operators in a certain real representation @xmath31 of @xmath30 , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the index for the representation @xmath31 . in these cases ,",
    "intermediate states are labelled by their spin and the representation appearing in @xmath34 , and the crossing relation gives a vectorial sum rule @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "correspondingly , we find a bound for the conformal dimension of the lowest operator appearing in @xmath35 ope for each irreducible representation contained in @xmath34 to obtain a critical curve @xmath36 ( @xmath37 and @xmath27 denoting the representation and spin ) .",
    "note that the possible representation @xmath37 and parity of @xmath27 are correlated by bose symmetry of the operator .    in @xcite",
    ", they studied the case of @xmath38 in @xmath1 with @xmath31 given by fundamental representation in detail . in this case",
    "we have three irreducible representations , singlet ( which we denote @xmath39 ) , second - rank symmetric tensor ( @xmath40 ) , and anti - symmetric tensor representation ( @xmath41 ) . in the @xmath39 sector , they found kinks ( though the changes of the slope were milder ) in @xmath42 , the location of which exhibits an excellent agreement with that of @xmath10 heisenberg fixed points proposed in the other methods ( e.g. large @xmath2 expansion ) .",
    "they also obtained the bounds for scalar operators in the @xmath40 sector .",
    "the resulting @xmath43 reveals intriguing but not as prominent features : at the point where the @xmath10 model sits , it starts to grow approximately linearly .",
    "our focus is @xmath44 ( with @xmath45 for simplicity ) in @xmath1 under the presence of a scalar operator in bifundamental representation @xmath31 corresponding to @xmath46 in . in this case , @xmath47 contains nine irreducible representations , which are product representations formed by @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "the sum rule encoding this information is conveniently expressed in terms of a @xmath48 matrix , which we have derived following the line of @xcite .    to compute numerical bounds ,",
    "we follow the methods described in @xcite though the details are somewhat distinct . for example , we include intermediate operators with spin @xmath49 . since the sum rule matrix is larger and computational task is much heavier than @xmath10 case , we work in lower dimensional search spaces , namely @xmath50-dimensional ones ( or @xmath51 in @xcite , @xmath52 in @xcite ) . in @xcite , they obtained the bounds by assuming the conformal dimension of intermediate scalar operator in the @xmath40 sector to be greater than 1 for technical reasons , but we only impose the unitarity bound in every sectors .",
    "we use the @xmath53 - series expansions in @xcite to generate the residues of the conformal blocks .",
    "our normalization condition of the linear functional @xmath54 is such that it gives the value @xmath55 when it acts on the vector for a dimension @xmath56 conformal block in the spin 0 @xmath57 sector .",
    "our implementation for ` sdpa - gmp ` @xcite@xcite is the same as in @xcite except that the parameter ` precision ` is @xmath58 .",
    "we first performed the numerical computation for @xmath59 model since the value @xmath60 is well above the existence bound on additional chiral / anti - chiral fixed points obtained from the large @xmath61 analysis of @xcite .    * symmetry enhancement in the singlet sector .",
    "* we computed the bounds for the first scalar operator in the @xmath62 sector , @xmath63 .",
    "we present the results in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "they turned out to be identical within the precision of @xmath64 to those of the @xmath39 sector in @xmath65 model .",
    "such `` symmetry enhancement '' behavior was reported in @xcite between @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "as stressed there , we can prove the inequality @xmath68 immediately because we can regard every cft with @xmath65 symmetry as a cft with @xmath59 symmetry upon decomposing @xmath65 representations into those of @xmath69 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the kink shown in the ss sector corresponds to the heisenberg fixed point .",
    "however , the reason for the actual equality here is still mysterious .",
    "meanwhile , chiral / anti - chiral fixed points lie well below the bound , which confirms the consistency of our analysis , but simultaneously implies that we will not be able to approach these fixed points in this manner .",
    "we propose an alternative way to spot them in the rest of the present section .     for @xmath70(red dots ) and @xmath71 for @xmath65 ( blue line ) : the vertical precision is @xmath72 .",

    "moreover we have predicted the edge of the conformal window for anti - chiral fixed points .",
    "we emphasize that not only can our results serve as a novel tool for the study of critical phenomena , but they are encouraging for the conformal bootstrap program itself because our result makes it evident that _ different _ kind of cfts are hidden behind a _ single _ ( vectorial ) bootstrap equation .",

    "our prediction of the conformal window is based on the anti - chiral fixed point . if the rg picture that the disappearance of the anti - chiral fixed point is induced by the annihilation with the chiral fixed point , the same conformal window should have been obtained from the chiral fixed point seen in @xmath92 spin 0 sector by changing @xmath2 .",
