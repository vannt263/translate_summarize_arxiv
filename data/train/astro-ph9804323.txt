    "the first uv spectroscopic observation of a quasar ( 3c  273 , @xcite ) enabled a measurement of the ly@xmath0/h@xmath0  ratio in an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . the low ratio of @xmath4 was in line with an independent study using the composite spectrum that was derived from various quasars ( @xcite ) , but was in sharp conflict with a canonical ratio of @xmath2 predicted by standard photoionization models ( @xcite ) .",
    "this `` ly@xmath0/h@xmath0  problem '' raised serious concerns about the validity of photoionization as the main line - emission mechanism in agn and prompted extensive theoretical interest in the following years .",
    "improved photoionization models ( @xcite , and references therein ) invoke large column densities and moderate degrees of ionization . in a partially ionized zone",
    ", the low escape probability for ly@xmath0  photons makes a high population of excited states , and collisional excitation from these levels enhances balmer lines .",
    "calculations using a reasonable agn continuum lead to an enhancement of balmer lines by a factor of @xmath5 , and hence may not fully explain the observed low ly@xmath0/h@xmath0  ratio .",
    "another explanation introduces intrinsic reddening in the line - emitting region ( @xcite ) .",
    "the wavelength - dependent extinction reduces the intensities of observed uv lines , thus lowering the ly@xmath0/h@xmath0  ratio",
    ". the observed pa@xmath0/h@xmath0  ratio , however , appears to be too low for a straightforward full account as a reddening effect ( @xcite ) .",
    "significant evidence exists for dust in the narrow - line region of seyfert galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and for a decrease in extinction with increasing luminosity toward quasars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite suggested that in intermediate - redshift quasars there may be significant reddening in the narrow - line region .",
    "accurate assessments of the reddening effect depend on the use of good line pairs whose intrinsic ratios are fairly stable .",
    "since singly ionized helium is hydrogenic , the he  ii",
    "i(ly@xmath0  @xmath1304)/i(h@xmath0  @xmath11640 ) ratio should therefore be the same as that for hydrogen .",
    "the he  ii  emission is produced mainly by recombination , because its excitation level of 40 ev is considerably higher than the average thermal energy in the line - emitting region .",
    "the wavelength of he  ii  @xmath1304 emission coincides with that of o@xmath6 transition @xmath7 , allowing bowen fluorescence radiation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this radiation mechanism , however , does not appreciably affect the he  iiratio itself .",
    "the he  ii  @xmath1304 emission should be extremely sensitive to reddening . while there are no hurdles in the theoretical aspects , it has taken some 20 years to advance from measuring this ratio in hydrogen to that in helium .",
    "as a result of searches for the he  ii  gunn - peterson effect in the intergalactic medium , the uv spectra of several hundred quasars have been studied with .",
    "the uv spectra of most high - z quasars are cut off by intervening lyman - limit systems , and only four quasars have so far been found to exhibit a detectable flux below the wavelength of the redshifted he  ii  @xmath1304 emission : q0302 - 003 ( z=3.286 ; @xcite ) , pks  1935 - 692 ( z=3.185 ; @xcite ) , hs  1700 + 64 ( z=2.743 ; @xcite ) , and he  2347 - 4342 ( z=2.885 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the he  ii  @xmath1304 emission , even with a profile that is partially absorbed , makes it possible to carry out the `` ly@xmath0/h@xmath0 '' test for ionized helium .",
    "we used the uv data of hs  1700 + 64 obtained with the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) during the astro-2 mission and that of q0302 - 003 obtained with  goddard high - resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) at an improved s / n ratio and resolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ghrs data were retrieved from the  archive and co - added .",
    "we obtained the optical spectra of these two quasars on several occasions .",
    "the results presented here are mainly from two observing runs in 1996 july and november . at the 2.3 m bok telescope of steward observatory , university of arizona , we used the b&c spectrograph with a loral @xmath8 ccd detector and a long slit of @xmath9 . on july 16 ( ut ) , the observations of hs  1700 + 64 were made with a grating of 600 line mm@xmath10 for 10,060  s , yielding a resolution of @xmath11    between @xmath12 and 7600   . on november 4 and 6",
    "we observed q0302 - 003 . on the first night , a total exposure of 21,600 s was made using a grating of 832 line mm@xmath10 that allows a spectral coverage from @xmath13 to 7600    with a resolution of 2.4   . on the other night , the total exposure was 25,200 s , and a grating of 400 line mm@xmath10 was used , covering @xmath14 and 8800    with a resolution of @xmath15   . with the seeing of @xmath16 , all the observations were made with a series of exposures of 30 minutes each . on each night , low - resolution spectra were also obtained to cover the wavelength band near the ly@xmath0  emission .",
    "the data were processed and analyzed using standard _ iraf _ tasks .",
    "the a- and b - band absorption were corrected with the templates derived from the standard stars .",
    "the removal was only partial because some exposures were obtained with large air mass without corresponding spectra of nearby template stars .",
    "spectra taken on different dates were combined , using exposure times as the weight .",
    "the spectra of hs  1700 + 64 and q0302 - 003 are displayed respectively in fig . 1 and 2 .",
    "the spectrum of hs  1700 + 64 covers too small a wavelength region shortward of the c  iv  to allow an accurate determination of the continuum level .",
    "we used another spectrum taken in 1994 june with the same telescope that covers wavelengths as low as 5000   .",
    "the fitted continuum matches that spectrum well .",
    "we therefore feel that the continuum used in the fitting is appropriate .",
    "the color excess @xmath17 was calculated as 0.05 for hs  1700 + 64 and 0.12 for q0302 - 003 , according to the estimated column density of galactic neutral hydrogen ( @xcite ) .",
    "such a conversion was based on the average galactic dust - to - gas ratio derived by @xcite , which yields a larger correction than using the formulation of @xcite .",
    "the blue part of the he  ii  @xmath1304 profile is absorbed by the intergalactic he  ii  absorption , so we only fitted the red part .",
    "the fitting results are presented in table  1 .",
    "the ly@xmath0  measurements were made using the spectra of lower resolution taken in the same observing runs .    for hs  1700 + 64 ,",
    "the fitted he  ii  @xmath1304 profile has a fwhm of @xmath18 12 000 , which matches that of the ly@xmath0  emission ( fwhm @xmath18 11 500 ; @xcite ) . in the optical spectrum",
    "there is no noticeable emission feature at the expected he  ii  @xmath11640 wavelength . to obtain an upper limit",
    ", we assumed a gaussian profile with a fixed centroid wavelength at 6138    and a fwhm of 12 000 .",
    "the he  ii  @xmath11640 flux is @xmath19 , yielding an i(@xmath1304)/i(@xmath11640 )   ratio of greater than 20",
    ". such a value may not be very reliable as a slight shift in the continuum level may change the ratio significantly .",
    "the current broad - band data of standard stars may not allow a confirmation of broad features at 1% level .",
    "therefore the result may not be inconsistent with the canonical value of 10 .",
    "the emission centered around 6385   does not correspond to known emission features in quasars , and we tentatively linked it to si i @xmath11701 ( @xcite ) , or a fe ii feature ( @xcite ) .    for q0302 - 003 , there is a significant narrow component for the ly@xmath0  and c  ivemission .",
    "each of the ly@xmath0 , c  iv  and n  v  was fitted with a pair of gaussian components .",
    "the narrow component has a fwhm of @xmath20   and accounts for about a half of the line intensity .",
    "the derived i(@xmath1304)/i(@xmath11640 )  ratio is @xmath21 , significantly lower than the predicted value with pure recombination .",
    "the i(@xmath1304)/i(@xmath11640 )  ratio is quite different in these two quasars .",
    "indeed the line profiles in q0302 - 003 are narrower , making it easier to identify the weak he  ii  @xmath11640 feature .",
    "the s / n level is high enough that a he  ii  @xmath11640 feature should be detected even with a line width of @xmath18 12 000 . in fig .",
    "1 the profile of an assumed he  ii  @xmath11640 feature is plotted , with an intensity 20% of the he  ii  @xmath1304 , which should have been detected .",
    "it appears that difference is not simply attributable to line widths .",
    "the intensity of he  ii  @xmath1304 emission is affected by the lyman line and continuum absorption by numerous intervening absorbers along the line of sight .",
    "this can be corrected if a high - resolution spectrum at longer wavelengths yields a list of absorption lines .",
    "our estimate , based on the statistical result of @xcite , suggests an optical depth of 0.2 at a rest - frame wavelength of 300   for a z=3.3 quasar .",
    "therefore , this lyman - valley correction is not very significant .",
    "the uv and optical observations are not simultaneous , and both quasars are probably variable .",
    "a comparison of the uv spectra of hs 1700 + 64 obtained between 1991 and 1995 finds a significant discrepancy in flux level , and that between the optical spectra taken between 1994 and 1996 shows that the ly@xmath0  equivalent width varies by a factor of 2 .",
    "the c  iv  equivalent width of q0302 - 003 has increased by @xmath22 as compared with the data of sargent , steidel & boksenberg ( 1989 ) .",
    "furthermore , the photometric quality of our optical spectra is questionable .",
    "a typical light loss with a small slit during an optical spectroscopic observation is @xmath23 .",
    "these factors add uncertainties to the i(@xmath1304)/i(@xmath11640)ratio .",
    "the derived line ratio is also subject to the reddening formulation .",
    "if we use the formula of burstein & heiles ( 1978 ) , this ratio would be even lower .",
    "we have carried out photoionization calculations ( @xcite ) with various parameters . with a broad range of the density , column density , flux and shape of the ionizing continuum , the i(@xmath1304)/i(@xmath11640 )",
    "ratio varies within a narrow range between 9 and 11 .",
    "it is therefore not practical to attribute the observed low value to special conditions in the line - emitting region .",
    "note that a part of the he  ii  @xmath1304 emission may receive a contribution from o  iii  @xmath1305 emission that is produced by bowen fluorescence mechanism ( @xcite ) .",
    "if this were the case , the actual i(@xmath1304)/i(@xmath11640 )  ratio would be even lower .",
    "the low i(@xmath1304)/i(@xmath11640 )  ratio in q0302 - 003 may signal internal reddening in the line - emitting region .",
    "dust grains with dimensions of @xmath24 cm are believed to produce galactic extinction ( @xcite ) which generally follows a @xmath25 law .",
    "if intrinsic extinction is produced by even smaller grains , and the wavelength dependence of the extinction law applies to wavelengths as short as 300   , then an @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes a band around 300  , is needed to explain the discrepancy between the observed and theoretical ratio of i(@xmath1304)/i(@xmath11640 ) .",
    "this would translate into @xmath28 .",
    "if this is the case , significant presence of dust may be a reality in the broad - line region of some high - redshift quasars .",
    "the quantitative formalism should be more complicated than that .",
    "while the extinction curves between 1 @xmath29 m and 1000    can be approximated with a @xmath25 law , very little is known about the extinction properties below 1000   . @xcite and",
    "@xcite calculated the euv extinction curve for graphite - silicate dust .",
    "their results show _ decreasing _ extinction from 1000    to 100   .",
    "@xcite suggested that a numerical formula can be applied to other galaxies , possibly to those of higher redshifts , without assuming a galactic dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "if such extinction is real , the same extinction affects the intensity of other uv lines as well .",
    "the intrinsic hydrogen ly@xmath0/h@xmath0  ratio in these objects may actually be higher than the observed ones .",
    "likely , the average ratio would be @xmath30 , closer than the theoretical value of @xmath2 .",
    "this will , in turn , help understand the classical ly@xmath0/h@xmath0puzzle .",
    "if significant reddening does exist in the quasar broad - line region , the observed ly@xmath0/h@xmath0  ratio may be corrected upward by an additional factor of @xmath5 .",
    "even for these two quasars , the i(@xmath11216)/i(@xmath1304 ) ratio is very different . in hs  1700 + 64 ,",
    "this ratio is about 3 , while in q0302 - 003 it is about 30 .",
    "significant extinction in the euv band can explain both the abnormal line ratios .",
    "the i(@xmath11216)/i(@xmath1304 ) ratio in both objects is 30 or higher , consistent with photoionization models .",
    "therefore , the likely cause for the low ratio in q0302 - 003 is extinction in the broad line region by very small grains .    it may not be coincidental that narrow line widths and possibly significant reddening are present in the same object .",
    "seyfert 2 galaxies often show a higher degree of extinction ( @xcite ) , and the narrow - line region in seyfert-1 galaxies generally exhibit a more significant reddening effect than the broad - line region ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrum of q0302 - 003 shows a significant narrow component with fwhm @xmath20  for major emission lines .",
    "although this line width is not considered very narrow for seyfert galaxies , it is for high - z quasars .",
    "generally , narrow lines in high - z quasars ( @xcite ) are not as common as in seyfert galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite found no detection of narrow line components in their radio - loud quasars of @xmath31 .",
    "they suggested a significant reddening with @xmath32 .",
    "we suggest that the geometry of the line - emitting region in high - z quasars resembles that in the low - luminosity active galaxies , with the presence of dust mostly in the outer part .    making an analogy of seyfert galaxies and some low - redshift quasars",
    ", we suggest that q0302 - 003 has a narrow - line region which contains a significant amount of dust .",
    "we suggest that the geometry of the line - emitting region in high - z quasars resembles that in the low - luminosity active galaxies , with the presence of dust mostly in the outer part ( @xcite ) .",
    "does reddening apply to the euv continuum ?",
    "recent studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) found that the ly@xmath0/h@xmath33ratio ranges between about 1 and 40 and is approximately proportional to @xmath34 , the ratio of continuum flux at adjacent points ( @xcite ) .",
    "such a correlation may suggest a possible reddening effect that applies to both the continuum and lines .",
    "in such cases , the equivalent widths of concerned lines should be fairly constant . given the significant difference in the equivalent widths of he  ii  lines in our quasar samples , we see no compelling reason that the continuum emission from the central source is heavily reddened .",
    "significant reddening would also affect the intensities of infrared lines , and future studies of these lines may provide additional evidence for fine dust in the quasar environment .",
