    "the single spin - boson model @xcite describes a two - level system , like a spin-1/2 or a q - bit , which is linearly coupled to a bath of bosonic modes . in spite of its simplicity",
    "the system shows a multifaceted behavior in statics , dynamics and quantum criticality , for which reason it became a paradigmatic model in the field of quantum dissipation . for ohmic and sub - ohmic dissipation and degenerate energy of the two states the two - level system shows a transition at zero temperature from a delocalized state ( tunneling between the two states ) at weak coupling to the bath to a localized , classical behavior ( frozen in one state ) .",
    "the characteristics , in particular the universality class , of this quantum phase transition is identical to the one of the thermal transition in the classical ising chain with long - range interactions@xcite .    an interesting question is : what happens to this transition if one couples several two - level systems , like impurities or q - bits , to a bosonic dissipative bath ?",
    "the simplest generalization of this kind is a pair of two - level systems , which has been studied the first time in [ ] and subsequently by [ ] . in many studies of the two - spin - boson model",
    "an additional ferromagnetic coupling between the two - level systems of spins has been taken into account .",
    "arranging @xmath3 two - level systems in a chain with uniform ferromagnetic nearest neighbor interactions and coupling each of it to its own bosonic bath yields the transverse ising chain with dissipation that has been studied for an ohmic bath in [ ] . there it was shown that in the limit @xmath4 a new quantum phase transition triggered by the bath coupling strength emerges , which is different from the quantum phase transition in the transverse ising chain without dissipation and different from the single spin - boson model .",
    "if the ferromagnetic couplings between the two - level systems are not uniform but random the random transverse ising chain with dissipation is obtained , which has been studied in [ ] . here not a sharp phase transition occurs but a smeared transition in which connected clusters of two - level systems undergo separate quantum phase transitions at different coupling strengths @xcite .",
    "these earlier investigations for arbitrary two - level system number @xmath3 assume an independent bath for each two - level system .",
    "this might not always represent correctly the physical situation , in which a single bath for all two - level systems might be more appropriate  as for instance in cold atom or trapped ion setups .",
    "in addition a direct coupling between the two - level systems might be absent .",
    "this is the situation in which we address in this paper by studying the multi - spin - boson model ( msbm ) with a single bosonic bath .",
    "one expects that in spite of the absence of a direct interaction between the two - level systems the common bath will mediate an effective interaction between the two - level systems that enhances the tendency towards localization and thus decreases the critical bath coupling strength .    for @xmath5 and ohmic bath a recent variational calculation @xcite obtained a critical coupling of @xmath6 , whereas a numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) calculation @xcite predicted ( for vanishing direct coupling between the two - level systems ) @xmath7 .",
    "regarding such a large deviation between the naive mean - field prediction of @xmath8 and the nrg result for @xmath5 a close look at larger values for @xmath3 using exact methods like quantum monte carlo seems worthwhile . therefore in this paper",
    "we analyze quantitatively in which way the location and characteristics of the quantum phase transition varies with the number @xmath3 and the separation of two - level systems and also shed light on the correlations between the two - level systems mediated by the bath in the different phases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce the msbm including its path integral representation and discuss the zero - tunneling limit as well as the mean - field limit . the quantum phase transition in the msbm model is analyzed in section iii for general number of two - level systems , @xmath3 , first theoretically and then with the help of extensive quantum monte carlo simulations . in section",
    "iv the spin - spin correlations in the msbm in the different phases are discussed and in section v the effect of spatial separations of the two - level systems in the msbm is analyzed .",
    "section vi contains a summary and a discussion of open questions .",
    "several details of the calculations as well as a detailed description of the quantum monte carlo algorithm are deferred to three appendices .",
    "for completeness and for further reference we first summarize the characteristics of the quantum phase transition in the single spin - boson model .",
    "its hamiltonian is given by ( @xmath9 ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the pauli spin-1/2 operators , @xmath12(@xmath13 ) are the bosonic creation ( annihilation ) operators , @xmath14 the bare tunneling amplitude , @xmath15 is the frequency of the @xmath16th bath mode , @xmath17 a energy - bias of one of the two states , which we set to zero ( @xmath18 ) .",

    ", the phase transition is of second order , which is described by a gaussian fixed point with `` classical '' exponents for @xmath28 and has non - classical , @xmath29-dependent critical exponents for @xmath30@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the generalization of ( [ ham_sbm ] ) to @xmath3 two - level systems coupled to a common bath .",
    "the hamiltonian of this multi - spin - boson model ( msbm ) is given by @xmath31 with the interaction term @xmath32 note that this setup is different from the dissipative spin - chain @xcite , where every spin is embedded in its own dissipative bath .",
    "the main effect of the non - markovian common bath is that the spins are sharing the same polarization induced to the bosonic degrees of freedom .",
    "from this picture one gets the intuition that the localization of the multi - spin system is enhanced in comparison to the single spin case .",
    "the delocalized - to - localized transition point @xmath1 is hence expected to become lowered as the number of contributing spins is increased .",

    "this simplifies the terms in ( [ eq : action ] ) and ( [ eq : kernel ] ) drastically , because no kinks can occur and hence the spin - worldlines are only spin variables @xmath55 without any @xmath56-dependence .",
