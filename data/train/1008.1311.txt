    "for general background , we refer the reader to lyndon and schupp @xcite , hempel @xcite , rolfsen @xcite and thurston @xcite .    presentations for groups , and their relationship with fundamental groups of topological complexes , has motivated much of the 20th century research into the classification of manifolds .",
    "the successful classification of the fundamental groups of surfaces naturally led to the desire to classify 3-manifold fundamental groups , and understand the extent to which uniqueness holds . in the case of simply - connected compact 3-manifolds ,",
    "uniqueness is essentially equivalent to the poincar conjecture , recently resolved by perelman in his solution of thurston s geometrization conjecture for 3-manifolds . in principle , fundamental groups of compact 3-manifolds are now algorithmically classifiable ( bridson @xcite ) . it has been known for decades that every finitely presentable group does arise ( non - uniquely ) as the fundamental group of some closed orientable 4-manifold . not all finitely presentable groups arise as the fundamental groups of compact 3-manifolds  see for example , kawauchi @xcite or shalen @xcite  and moreover the isomorphism problem for finitely presentable groups is algorithmically unsolvable ( @xcite ) : it is of interest to make more precise the nature of the distinction between compact 3-manifold - groups and arbitrary finitely presentable groups .",
    "quinn has shown that all finitely presentable groups arise as the fundamental groups of _ non - orientable _",
    "3-complexes , _ allowing boundary _ , but where all vertex links are either spheres or",
    "_ projective planes_. this construction is elucidated in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show they arise as the fundamental groups of _ orientable _ 3-complexes , with _ empty _ boundary , with all vertex links being either spheres or _",
    "tori_. as a consequence , the combinatorial group theory of finitely presentable groups can be set more centrally in the theory of orientable 3-manifolds , geometric structures and the theory of knots and links .    every closed orientable surface can be triangulated ; after deleting vertices , taking the universal cover topologically produces the ideal triangulation of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "geometrically , we see every closed surface fundamental group arising from the compactification of a hyperbolic riemann surface , with finitely - generated free fundamental group , by replacing cusp points .",
    "all closed ( ie , compact with empty boundary ) orientable topological 3-manifolds can be given an essentially unique piecewise - linear ( ` pl ' ) structure  and hence can be viewed as a union of tetrahedra with all faces identified in pairs .",
    "every pl-3-manifold admits an essentially unique smoothing as a differentiable manifold .",
    "similar arguments show that every compact orientable 3-complex , obtained by arbitrary pairwise identification of faces of a disjoint union of tetrahedra , admits an essentially unique differentiable structure in the complement of its vertices .",
    "the following is well known ( see for example @xcite ) :    for a compact orientable triangulated 3-complex @xmath12 without boundary , obtained by pairwise face identifications of a finite number of tetrahedra , the following are equivalent :    1 .",
    "the euler characteristic @xmath13 of @xmath12 vanishes : @xmath14 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath12 is a 3-manifold ; 3 .",
    "all interior vertex links are 2-spheres .    a simple weakening of the concept of ( compact , orientable ) 3-manifold is to allow finitely many vertex links which are the next simplest closed orientable surface , that is , a torus .",
    "( in dimension 2 , a link can only be a circle . )",
    "suppose @xmath12 is such a 3-complex , and we delete an open cone neighbourhood of each singular point .",
    "the result is a 3-manifold @xmath15 with non - empty boundary a finite union of tori , and every such manifold can be obtained from a closed orientable 3-manifold @xmath9 by deleting an open tubular neighourhood of an embedded link @xmath16 . since coning a 2-sphere boundary component to a point does not change the fundamental group , in the following we generally consider compact orientable 3-manifolds with no 2-spheres in their boundary .",
    "the euler characteristic of a surface determines its possible constant - curvature geometries .",
    "accordingly , spheres and tori play a major role in the structure of 3-manifolds : embedded spheres arise from @xmath17 , giving the prime decomposition of 3-manifolds ; embedded tori yield the jsj decomposition of 3-manifolds ( also mirrored in group - theoretic constructions ) ; and any aspherical , atorioidal closed orientable 3-manifold with infinite fundamental group admits a complete metric of negative curvature , according to perelman - thurston .",
    "suppose @xmath12 is an arbitrary compact , orientable 3-manifold with @xmath18 , but containing no 2-sphere components .",

    "every finite - volume hyperbolic 3-manifold is uniquely the interior of some @xmath22 .",
    "a _ link - singular _ 3-manifold is any compact orientable 3-complex obtained from a compact orientable 3-manifold @xmath23 by attaching cones to some or all boundary tori : all interior vertex links are thus either spheres or tori",
    ".    for @xmath22 , denote by @xmath24 the orientable 3-complex obtained by coning each boundary torus to a distinct point ( setting @xmath25 when @xmath26 ) .",
    "when @xmath27 is a finite - component link in some closed orientable 3-manifold @xmath12 , there is an open tubular neighbourhood @xmath28 giving the link exterior @xmath29 .",
    "we let @xmath30 denote the link - singular 3-manifold obtained from @xmath31 by attaching a cone to each boundary torus of the exterior .    instead of coning boundary tori to points , we can attach a ` solid torus ' or ` donut ' ",

    ". any closed orientable 3-manifold @xmath12 can be obtained from any given one @xmath33 by dehn surgery on a link @xmath34 , which essentially means the deletion of solid tori neighbourhoods of all link components , and reattaching these by a possibly homotopically non - trivial homeomorphism of their boundary tori , specified by an integer assigned to each link component .",
    "this follows from work 50 years ago by rohlin , lickorish and wallace : craggs and kirby independently described the generators of the equivalence relation on the surgery instructions required to produce the same 3-manifold , notably in the case @xmath35 .",
    "we give elementary knot - theoretic proofs of the following :    [ mt ] let @xmath7 denote an arbitrary finitely presentable group .",
    "then @xmath36 for some link @xmath37 in a closed 3-manifold @xmath12 , whose complement @xmath38 admits a complete metric of constant curvature @xmath39 and finite volume .",
    "thus every finitely presentable group is the fundamental group of a link - singular 3-manifold , where the complement of all singular points admits a complete hyperbolic metric of finite volume .    as a corollary",
    ", we obtain our main theorem , using the 3-dimensional analogue of the standard compacitifcation of cusps of hyperbolic riemann surfaces : for @xmath0 any kleinian group of isometries of hyperbolic 3-space @xmath1 , with @xmath2 a non - compact @xmath3-cusped orientable 3-manifold of finite volume , let @xmath4 be its dense set of parabolic fixed points .",
    "let @xmath5 be the 3-complex obtained by compactifying each cusp of @xmath6 with an additional point .",
    "every finitely presentable group @xmath7 is of the form @xmath8 , for infinitely many kleinian groups @xmath0 .    if @xmath7 is the fundamental group of a closed orientable 3-manifold @xmath12 , then @xmath7 can be realized as the fundamental group of a closed link - singular 3-manifold with any even number of singular points by @xmath40-summing with some number of copies of @xmath41 , the suspension of a torus , by the seifert - van kampen theorem , since @xmath42 .    that our main result might be true",
    "was motivated by the well - known result of lickorish and wallace that every closed orientable 3-manifold can be obtained by surgery on some link in the 3-sphere ( see @xcite ) , that the connect sum @xmath43 has fundamental group @xmath44 ( the free group of rank @xmath45 ) , and that all finitely presentable groups arise as quotients of a free group .",
    "we prove the theorem by constructing a very simple link @xmath46 in the 3-sphere @xmath47 from a given finite presentation @xmath48 of a group @xmath7 , analyzing the wirtinger presentation of the fundamental group of its complement , and showing that killing off certain elements of the fundamental groups of peripheral tori yields the desired 3-complex with previously specified finite presentation of any arbitrary group .",
    "similar links have arisen in related applications in the past , and accordingly we introduce a convenient more symmetric refinement of these constructions ( @xcite ) .",
    "when referring to a finite presentation we will consider both the generating set and the set of defining relations as ordered sets .",
    "let @xmath49 be a finite ( ordered ) presentation for an arbitrary finitely presentable group @xmath7 .",
    "each relation @xmath50 is thus a word @xmath51 in the monomials @xmath52 , and @xmath7 is obtained from the free group @xmath53 of rank @xmath45 with presentation @xmath54 by taking the quotient group @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the normal closure of the set of relations .",
    "we associate to @xmath48 a link in @xmath47 as follows : each relation @xmath50 has a well defined length @xmath57 , and we set @xmath58 , the total length of the presentation .",
    "it is well known that the complement of a disjoint union of @xmath59 unknotted and unlinked circles has fundamental group @xmath60 free of rank @xmath59 .",
    "from such a link , we will change crossings to introduce wirtinger relations and produce an appropriate wirtinger presentation for the new link complement according to the conventions of figure [ fig : wirtinger ] : labels correspond to generators of the fundamental group of the complement assigned to each overarc of a link diagram .     denote meridians of arcs at a ` negative ' crossing ( left ) and a ` positive ' crossing ( right ) .",

    "generators correspond to small meridian loops linking each of the @xmath3 oriented over - arcs of a projection , oriented according to the right - hand rule ; the corresponding 4-valent planar graph has @xmath3 vertices and @xmath62 arcs , which combine to create the @xmath3 overarcs .",

    "to each of the @xmath70 segments there corresponds a unique monomial @xmath71 occurring in a unique relation @xmath50 of @xmath48 : as we read the monomials @xmath72 in the concatenated word @xmath73 from left to right , we move anticlockwise from one segment to the next . *",
    "each relation @xmath50 corresponds to @xmath74 consecutive segments of @xmath68 .",
    "we will make @xmath70 modifications of the link , using the same procedure in each segment : if @xmath75 is associated to a given segment of @xmath68 , we create simple linking between the components arcs of @xmath66 and @xmath68 within the segment , with linking number @xmath76 .",

    "the link @xmath85 has the following properties : + \\(a ) components remain planar , unknotted , and parametrized by the standard angles of the unit circle , giving a closed @xmath86-stranded pure braid ; ( b ) finitely many crossings occur , with at most one for any given angle ; + \\(c ) the set of plane - projected crossings decompose all component circles @xmath87 into subarcs with corresponding meridians labeled either @xmath88 or @xmath89 , where the second subscripts are consecutive along each oriented circle , beginning with the first - labeled subarc corresponding to the segment at standard angle @xmath90 .",
    "the total number of subarcs is @xmath62 , and at each crossing , the two subarcs of the overarc have equal meridian generators of @xmath91 assigned to them .",

    "there are thus six types of crossings of interest in the link projection , according to the sign of the crossing , and which of a generator or relation component creates the overarc .",
    "* it is convenient to use a mild variation of the standard wirtinger presentation , using @xmath62 generators for symmetry purposes , and @xmath62 relations , @xmath3 of which being equivalent to the standard relations , and the additional @xmath3 asserting equalities for the additional generators .",

    "conversely , by allowing additional boundary components , it is conceivable that we may decrease the number of singular points required to realize @xmath7 .",
    "suppose @xmath7 admits a finite presentation with @xmath65 relations .",
    "then  @xmath123    _ proof : _ by the construction above , we know there exists a closed link - singular 3-manifold with at most @xmath65 singular points which realizes @xmath7 .",
    "thus @xmath124 . in @xcite",
