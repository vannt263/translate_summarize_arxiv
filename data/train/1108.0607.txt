    "the broadband spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of blazars are double - peaked .",
    "generally , the bump at the ir - optical - uv band is explained with the synchrotron process of relativistic electrons accelerated in the jets , and the bump at the gev - tev gamma - ray band is due to the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of the same electron population ( e.g. , ghisellini et al .",
    "1996 ; urry 1999 ) .",
    "the seed photon field may be from the synchrotron radiation themselves ( the so - called ssc model ; maraschi et al .",
    "1992 , ghisellini et al . 1996 ) or from external radiation fields ( ec ) , such as the broad line region ( blr ; sikora et al .",
    "1994 ) , accretion disk ( dermer et al . 1992 ) , torus ( blazejowski et al . 2000 ) , and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ; tavecchio et al .",
    "the low energy bump is well sampled with the data from multi - wavelength campaigns at the radio , optical , and x - ray bands .",
    "the observations with cgro / egret and ground - based tev gamma - ray telescopes sketch the feature of the high energy bump for some sources , but they are still poorly constrained .",
    "the observations with _ fermi_/lat , which covers an energy band from 20 mev to @xmath10 gev , together with the ground - based observations at the tev gamma - ray band , now pin down both the luminosity and the frequency of high energy peak well in the observed seds for some blazars .",
    "broadband seds obtained simultaneously or quasi - simultaneously are critical to reveal the radiation mechanisms .",
    "about forty active galactic nuclei ( agns ) have been detected in the tev gamma - ray band since the first detection of tev gamma - rays from mkn 421 with the whipple imaging atmospheric - cherenkov telescopes in 1992 ( punch et al .",
    "1992 ) and most of them are blazars .",
    "observations show that these sources have violent variability in multi - frequency , especially at the x - ray and the tev bands ( buckley et al .",
    "1996 ; takahashi et al .",
    "2000 ; sambruna et al .",
    "the flux variations at the x - ray and tev bands are correlated , such as that observed in mkn 421 ( blazejowski et al .",
    "some sources detected by egret are not confirmed by _",

    "fermi_/lat in the 1fgl and in the 2fgl ( ackermann et al .",
    "these facts indicate that agns should have significant variability in the gev - tev band . in the high state of tev emission ,",
    "the peak frequency ( @xmath11 ) of the synchrotron radiation in the seds moves to higher energies for some sources , showing a tendency that a higher tev flux corresponds to a harder spectrum for the emission at the x - ray and gamma - ray bands , as observed in mkn 501 ( anderhub et al .",
    "it is unclear what may be responsible for the flux variation and the corresponding spectral shift .",
    "the abundant data observed with _ fermi_/lat in the mev - gev band , together with the tev gamma - ray data , now provide an excellent opportunity to reveal the physical origin of the temporal and spectral variations of these tev sources .",
    "it is generally believed that the jets of agns are powered by the central massive black hole ( bh ) , whereas the mechanism of the jet production is still a mystery .",
    "the proposed models can be simplified as two types , i.e. , accretion and rotation of the bh .",
    "the connection between jet and accretion disk has been widely investigated ( ulvestad & ho 2001 ; marscher et al .",

    "ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found that the jet power is slightly larger than the disk luminosity and proportional to the mass accretion rate .",
    "however , the accretion process can not explain the radio loudness of agn , and thus the rotation of the bh is suggested to be the possible ingredient ( sikora et al .",
    "2007 ; lagos et al .",
    "in fact , there is some evidence for rapidly spinning bh ( cao & li 2008 ; wu et al .",
    "the jets of agns may be powered by both the accretion process and the spin of the central bh ( fanidakis et al .",
    "the seds of bl lac objects dominated by jet emission suffer less contamination of the emission from accretion disk and ec process .",
    "therefore , they are the best candidates for investigating the jet properties and the relation to the central bhs .    in this paper ,",
    "we compile a sample of seds for tev bl lac objects to study their physical properties of the jets and explore the physical reasons that result in the flux variation and the spectral shift in these sources as well as the relations of jet production to the accretion and rotation of the central bhs .",

    "twenty - four bl lac objects are included in our sample as listed in table 1 .",
    "we compile their broadband seds that were simultaneously or quasi - simultaneously observed with _",
    "fermi_/lat and other instruments from literature .",
    "only one broadband sed is constructed for 14 objects and two broadband seds are available for the other ten objects .",

    "although the contributions of ec component may be involved for some objects ( e.g. , 3c 66a , abdo et al .",
    "2011 ) , the external photon fields are usually much weaker than the synchrotron radiation photon field for the bl lac objects . multi - zone syn+ssc models are also used to explain the seds of some sources , such as mkn 421 ( blazejowski et al . 2005 ) . for seeking the consistency among objects in our statistical analysis",

    ", the kn effect could be significant and make the ic spectrum have a high energy cut off .",
    "we take this effect into account in our model calculations .",

    "if the jet is powered purely by accretion of bh and reflects the accretion rate to some extent , i.e. , @xmath191 , the negative correlation of jet power and bh mass would imply that the accretion rate is correlated with @xmath192 .",
    "that is clearly unreasonable , and thus the relationship between @xmath182 and @xmath183 disfavors the pure accretion powered jet scenario .",
    "therefore , we suggest that drawing the spin energy of the central bh should play a significant role in producing these jets .",
    "on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fig:4](b ) would imply a decrease in the bh spin with an increase in @xmath183 .",
    "these suggest that the growth of bh mass in our sample ( all with small redshift @xmath193 ) is mostly through a series of random accretion processes that decrease the bh spin statistically ( king & pringle 2006 ; king et al .",

    "both models require that the jet formation needs a poynting flux dominated energy transport by a strongly magnetized or high-@xmath5 plasma ; however , parsec - scale observations indicate that the jets are dominated by particles and are low-@xmath5 plasma .",
    "we also present the correlation between @xmath194 and @xmath195 ( excluding the data with upper or lower limits ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](c ) , and find that the jets of those sources are indeed dominated by the particles too , either for the electron pair model or for the electron - proton model .",
    "our results thus also face the @xmath5-problem .",
    "as described in section 4.1 , the magnetic field in the jets may be carried from the accretion flow ( harris & krawczynski 2006 ) and are diluted significantly as the jets propagate .",
    "it is therefore required that the majority of the poynting flux is converted to particle energies efficiently even beyond equipartition .",
