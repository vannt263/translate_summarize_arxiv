    "multilayer turbulent flow , in particular , multilayer turbulent convection is a phenomenon occurring widely in nature .",
    "an example is the coupled system of atmospheric and oceanic convections , in which convection is either thermally driven or density driven .",
    "other examples of convection involving coupled fluid layers are the earth s upper and lower mantle @xcite , and the lower mantle and the outer core . for industrial applications , multilayer thermal convection is associated with the liquid encapsulated crystal growth technique @xcite and understanding this particular phenomenon will help to improve crystal growth .",
    "rayleigh - bnard convection ( rbc ) , a fluid layer confined between two horizontally parallel plates cooled from above and heated from below , has been studied extensively as an idealised model for turbulent thermal convection .",
    "the system is controlled by three parameters , namely the rayleigh number @xmath1 , the prandtl number @xmath2 and the aspect ratio @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath5 the temperature difference across a fluid layer of height @xmath6 , @xmath7 the diameter of the convection cell , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively the thermal expansion coefficient , kinematic viscosity and the thermal diffusivity of the convecting fluid .",
    "one of the fascinating features in turbulent rbc is the emergence of a coherent large - scale circulation ( lsc ) , which results from the clustering and self - organization of thermal plumes erupted from the top and bottom thermal boundary layers @xcite .",
    "ever since the discovery of the lsc by @xcite , extensive experimental studies of it s structure and dynamics have been made in single - layer turbulent thermal convection ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 remain as the control parameters for convection in each of the fluid layers . as most of convections involving multilayer fluids in nature are in turbulent regime , it is highly desirable that such phenomenon be investigated in a laboratory setting , where experimental parameters can be precisely controlled .",
    "owing to the presence of a fluid - fluid interface , the boundary conditions of the fluid layers confined between the top and bottom plates will be different from the traditional rbc . in two - layer turbulent rbc",

    "the existence of the lsc is revealed by the non - zero amplitude of the first fourier mode obtained from the horizontal temperature profiles measured along the cell periphery .",
    "examples of instantaneous temperature profiles with cosine fitting curves measured at the mid - height of water and fc77 are shown in figure  [ fig : exsistance_lsc ] , from which we obtain the amplitude @xmath33 and phase @xmath34 of the first fourier mode .",
    "it is seen that in both layers , the profiles can be fitted very nicely by cosine functions .",
    "the results thus indicate that lsc exists in both fluid layers .",
    "another evidence for the existence of the lsc is the relative weight of the first fourier mode compared with other modes .",
    "it is found that the energy contained in the first fourier mode is about 93.7% of the total energy in water , and about 96.3% of that in fc77 , which also confirms the existence of the lscs @xcite .",
    "in addition , the calculated cross - correlation coefficients of the orientation @xmath34 measured at different heights imply that the lscs in both layers are of single - roll structure .    a feature seen in figure  [ fig : exsistance_lsc ]",
    "is that @xmath58 is larger than @xmath59 , which is due to the relatively small thermal diffusivity of fc77 .",
    "several flow states can be observed from these instantaneous profiles .",
    "one is that the azimuthal orientations of the lscs in water and in fc77 are in phase with each other ( figure  [ fig : exsistance_lsc](@xmath60 ) ) , the second is that the azimuthal orientations of the two lscs are out - of - phase from each other ( figure  [ fig : exsistance_lsc](@xmath61 ) ) and the third one shows that the strength of lsc in fc77 almost vanishes while that in water remains above zero ( figure  [ fig : exsistance_lsc](@xmath62 ) ) .    ) and fc77 ( @xmath63 ) with the cosine fitting curves . ]        we show in figure  [ fig : trace_water ] the time traces of @xmath64 and @xmath65 in water .",

    "this phenomenon contrasts sharply to that of single - layer turbulent rbc , where there is one preferred orientation for the lsc in a cylindrical cell .",
    "it was proposed that the preferred orientation in that case may be due to the coriolis force induced by the rotation of earth @xcite .",

    "it will be shown below that these are the same preferred orientations as those in the water layer . in figures  [ fig : trace_fc](@xmath69 ) and ( @xmath70 ) we zoom in the time traces that have the same period as those shown in figure  [ fig : trace_water](@xmath69 ) and ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the transitions between the two plateau levels are now obvious .",
    "this is quite different from the behaviour of the lsc in water , where there are only 6 such transitions .",

    "as the lsc is a coherent motion of thermal plumes erupted from the thermal boundary layer @xcite , the interface between the two fluids may be affected by the two lscs above and below it .",
    "this in turn may modify the behaviour of plume emissions from the interface for both the upward going warm plumes in the water and the downward going cold plumes in the fc77 .",
    "this interaction leads to coupling of the two lscs and results in their azimuthal orientations to be either parallel or anti - parallel with each other , corresponding to the ` plateau levels ' in the time traces of @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "these parallel or anti - parallel states of the lsc s orientation are similar to the thermal coupling and viscous coupling of the convection rolls near the onset of convection in two - layer rbc @xcite .",
    "the same terminologies will therefore be used to define the coupling of the lscs in the turbulent regime , which are :    * the flow directions of the lscs are the same at the sidewall region , and are opposite to each other at the fluid - fluid interface ( figure[fig : conditional_deltat](@xmath60 ) , left panel ) ; * the flow directions of the lscs at the sidewall region are opposite to each other , and those at the fluid - fluid interface are the same ( figure  [ fig : conditional_deltat](@xmath60 ) , right panel ) .    for the time periods that the lscs are neither thermally nor viscously coupled , we call them transient states .",

    "the same preferred orientation of the two lscs is one indication of flow - coupling of the two fluid layers .",
    "we now examine the effect of flow - coupling on the global properties of the system .",
    "the p.d.f . of the flow state parameter @xmath79",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : conditional_deltat](@xmath62 ) .",
    "it is seen that the p.d.f.s of @xmath79 have a peak close to 0 and a small shoulder close to @xmath84 , which corresponds to the thermal and viscous coupling modes respectively .",
    "the probability that the system stays in the thermally coupled mode is found to be @xmath85 and that for viscous coupling mode is only @xmath86 , which suggests that the two lscs always like to stay in parallel to each other . as the lsc in each of the fluid layer is predominantly a single roll structure , parameters",
    "@xmath87 and @xmath88 essentially show similar statistics .",
    "thus only results based on @xmath89 will be presented in the analysis hereafter .",
    "the temperature difference @xmath5 across the top and bottom plates conditioned on @xmath89 is shown in figure  [ fig : conditional_deltat](@xmath61 ) . under constant heat flux at the bottom plate , @xmath5 is inversely proportional to the global @xmath90 of the system .",
    "thus , the thermal coupling mode has a higher heat transfer efficiency when compared with the viscous one .",
    "although the heat transfer efficiency difference between the two coupling modes is small , the physics involved is clear .",
    "that is different internal flow states in turbulent thermal convection can indeed produce different global responses for the system .",
    "it was first discovered in a single - layer turbulent rbc with @xmath91 that the heat transport efficiency of the system depends on the internal flow modes of the lsc @xcite .",
    "finally we remark that , as a result of the interaction of the two lscs , the interface between the two fluid layers may undergo some kind of deformation , such as surface waves .",
    "indeed , preliminary shadowgraph observation indicates that there are wavy motions at the interface .",

    "cessations are rather rare events ; its frequency of occurrence is on the order of one in several days in @xmath91 and @xmath92 cells @xcite .",
    "a strict definition of cessation requires the flow strength @xmath33 at top , middle and bottom heights of lsc to fall below a threshold value simultaneously . in order to acquire more statistics ,",
    "a less strict definition has also been used , which requires only one of the above strengths to fall below the threshold . in @xcite , this latter situation",
    "is named decoherence . in the present work , both cessations and decoherences will be studied .",
    "if after a cessation the lsc s azimuthal orientation is changed by @xmath84 , it is called a cessation - led reversal . @xcite",
    "have found that in a @xmath93 cell the lsc is equally likely to reemerge in any azimuthal orientation after a cessation , so reversals are much more rare events than cessations . in a @xmath91 cell , @xcite found that after a decoherence at the mid - height , the lsc is more likely to reverse it s direction , which is due to the complex flow mode transitions as discovered later by @xcite . besides the cessation - led flow reversals , the lsc sometimes undergoes a fast change of its azimuthal orientation by @xmath84 without significant reduction of it s flow strength , which is called reorientation - led flow reversal .    in figure",

    "the normalized flow strength of water conditioned on the flow strength of fc77 is shown in figures  [ fig : a_condition_a](@xmath61 ) and that of fc77 conditioned on the flow strength of water is shown in figure  [ fig : a_condition_a](@xmath75 ) .",
    "it is seen from the figures that when the strength of one lsc increases , that of the other also increases .",
    "in this study we have made an experimental investigation of the dynamics and flow - coupling in turbulent rayleigh - bnard convection with two immiscible liquids .",
    "the two layers , water above fc77 , each has an aspect ratio of unity .",
    "it is found that there is one large - scale circulation ( lsc ) in each of the layers and they span the height of that layer .",
    "the dynamics of lscs in the two layers are quite different from that in single - layer turbulent thermal convection in the same parameter range .",
    "the major findings are ( @xmath92 ) there are two preferred orientations for the lscs in both water and fc77 , rather than one preferred orientation in the single - layer case .",
    "it is shown that these preferred orientations correspond to two coupling modes of the lscs , the thermal coupling mode where flows are opposite to each other above and below the interface of the two fluids and the viscous coupling mode where flows above and below the interface have the same direction .",
    "furthermore , the thermal coupling mode is found to be the predominant one and it also has slightly higher heat transfer efficiency for the whole system .",
    "( @xmath123 ) cessations in fc77 of the two - layer system occur an order - of - magnitude more frequently than they do in the single - layer case .",
    "( @xmath124 ) cessations most likely lead to flow reversals in fc77 .",
    "this property contrasts sharply with the uniform distribution of the azimuthal angular change of the lsc found in single - layer turbulent rbc .",
    "( @xmath125 ) flow reversals resulting from cessations and reorientations in the fc77 layer occur well - over two orders of magnitude more frequently than they do in the single - layer case .",
    "the greatly enhanced reversals may be understood as transitions of the system between its two metastable states , the thermal and viscous coupling modes .",
    "the fact that most cessations ( in the fc77 layer ) end up as reversals can also be understood as a symmetry breaking imposed by the orientation of the lsc in the water layer , which remained unchanged most of the time .",
    "it is further found that the influences of lscs to each other are not symmetric : the flow strength in water becomes weaker when the lsc in fc77 rotates faster azimuthally , whereas the flow strength in fc77 becomes stronger when the lsc in water rotates faster azimuthally .",
    "results presented in this paper may be of some relevance to flow reversals in coupled flow systems , such as the polarity reversals in the convective outer core of the earth which are coupled to the lower mantle , or wind reversals in the atmosphere which are also coupled with the ocean current .",
    "additionally , it is known that reversals in 3d systems occur much less frequently than they do in 2d convection systems and the properties and mechanisms of flow reversals in 3d and 2d systems are different @xcite .",
    "thus , with its greatly enhanced reversal / cessation frequency , the fc77 layer in the two - layer system may be used as a platform for the study of flow reversals / cessations in 3d turbulent convection .",
    "while the exact reason(s ) for the much - different behaviors of the fc77 and the water layers remain unknown , it is noted that the former has temperature boundary condition of constant heat flux at both its top and bottom , whereas the latter has constant flux at its bottom and constant temperature at its top boundary .",
