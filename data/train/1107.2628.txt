    "cosmological models with cold dark matter plus a @xmath3 term ( @xmath3cdm ) may explain most of the current astronomical observations ( see , e.g. , @xcite for some recent reviews ) .",
    "however , from the theoretical viewpoint it is really difficult to reconcile the small value required by observations ( @xmath4 ) with estimates from quantum field theories ranging from 50 - 120 orders of magnitude larger , as well as to explain why this is exactly the right value that is just beginning to dominate the energy density of the universe today .",
    "these issues make a complete cancellation of @xmath3 ( from some unknown symmetry of nature ) seem a plausible possibility and have also motivated a number of alternative explanations for the cosmic acceleration ( for some of these alternative scenarios , see  @xcite ) .",
    "one of these possibilities , possibly the next simplest approach toward an accelerating model for the universe , is to work with the idea that the dark energy component is due to a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath5 which has not yet reached its ground state and whose current dynamics is basically determined by its potential energy @xmath6",
    "clearly , however , such a procedure can not provide a model - independent parameter space to be compared with the observational data .",
    "another way , widely explored in the literature , is to build a phenomenological functional form for the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) , i.e. , the ratio of its pressure to its energy density , @xmath7 , in terms of its current value @xmath8 and of its time - dependence @xmath9 , and study its cosmological consequences as well as possible constraints on its behavior from observations .",
    "usually , these parameterizations have not only the standard @xmath3cdm scenario ( @xmath10 ) but also the so - called @xmath11cdm model ( @xmath12 as particular cases , so that constraints on its parameters may provide more accurate consistency checks to the original models .    examples of some eos parameterizations recently explored are ( see also  @xcite ) : @xmath13 an interesting aspect worth mentioning is that it is difficult to obtain the above parameterizations from usual scalar field dynamics since they are not limited functions , i.e. , the eos parameter does not lie in the interval @xmath14 $ ] . in other words , this amounts to saying that when extended to the entire history of the universe , @xmath15 , the three parameterizations above are divergent functions of the redshift ( see also @xcite for a discussion ) parameterizations given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be expressed as a single and generalized eos function , i.e. , @xmath16 , where the parameter @xmath17 takes , respectively , the values @xmath18 and @xmath19  @xcite . ] .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we investigated some cosmological consequences of a new phenomenological parameterization : @xmath20 or , equivalently,@xmath21 which has the same linear behavior at low redshifts presented by the parameterizations discussed above but with the advantage of being a limited function of @xmath1 throughout the entire history of the universe ( see also  @xcite for a recent analysis of a coupled quintessence model driven by a dark energy component parameterized by ( [ myparameterization ] ) ) .",
    "our goal in this paper is twofold .",
    "first , to derive a scalar field description for the dark component whose eos parameter is given by eq .",
    "( [ myparameterization ] ) . to that end",
    ", we use the theoretical method of constructing the dark energy potential @xmath6 directly from the effective eos , as developed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we also generalize this algorithm to include the so - called phantom case .",
    "second , to place constraints on the ( @xmath8 , @xmath22 ) plane of parameterization ( [ myparameterization ] ) from current observational data to check which class of dark energy is observationally prefered .",
    "we use some of the most recent type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) observations , namely , the so - called union2 sample of 557 events  @xcite , the nearby + sdss + essence + snls + hubble space telescope ( hst ) set of 288 sne ia discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( which we refer to as sdss compilation ) .",
    "we consider two sub - samples of this latter compilation that use salt2  @xcite and mlcs2k2  @xcite sn ia light - curve fitting method . along with the sne",
    "ia data , and to help break the degeneracy between the dark energy parameters we also use measurements of the baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak at @xmath23 and 0.6  @xcite and the current estimate of the cmb shift parameter of ref .",
    "@xcite .    0.1 in",
    "let us first consider a homogeneous , isotropic , spatially flat cosmologies described by the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) flat line element , @xmath24 , where we have set the speed of light @xmath25 .",
    "in such a background , the friedmann equation for a dark matter - dark energy dominated universe is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 stands for the non - relativistic ( dark plus baryonic ) matter .",
    "the energy density and pressure of the dark energy field are given by    @xmath28    @xmath29    where @xmath30 stands for quintessence ( @xmath31 )  @xcite and phantom fields ( @xmath32 )  @xcite , respectively .    by combining eqs .",

    "( [ phitilde ] ) and ( [ vphitilde ] ) are valid for both quintessence and phantom fields . by combining numerically these equations and taking into account the above constraints , we show in figures 1a and 1c the resulting potential @xmath47 for parameterization ( [ myparameterization ] ) for quintessence and phantom regimes , respectively .",
    "figures 1b and 1d show the evolution of the dark energy field as function of the redshift .",
    "the selected points used to plot the curves belong to quintessence and phantom families with @xmath48 and @xmath49 and follow the constraints given in sec .",
    "we note that , in contrast with a canonic scalar field in which the potential increases with the redshift ( panel 1b ) , for the phantom case shown in panel 1d @xmath47 decrease with @xmath1 .",
    "this result can be more easily understood by considering eq .",
    "( [ vphitilde ] ) , i.e. , for @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , so that for phantom fields @xmath53 when @xmath54 .",
    "before proceeding to the observational analyses on the @xmath55 parametric plane , it is worth mentioning that the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath22 of ( [ myparameterization ] ) are subject to the following constraints : @xmath56 and @xmath57 for a quintessence - like behavior and @xmath58 and @xmath59 for phantom fields .",
    "these bounds allow us to divide the parametric plane ( @xmath55 ) in defined regions associated to distinct classes of dark energy models that can be confronted with current observational data .",
    "these regions are shown in the figures 2a-2c , where the area of early dark energy dominance corresponds to the constraint @xmath60 , required to ensure @xmath61 at @xmath62 .",
    "the blank regions indicate models that at some point of the cosmic evolution , @xmath63 , have switched or will switch from quintessence to phantom behaviors or vice - versa .      in order to discuss the current observational constraints on @xmath8 and @xmath22 we use two of the most recent sne ia compilations available , namely , the union2 sample of ref .",
    "@xcite and the two compilations of the sdss collaborations discussed in ref .",
    "the union2 sample is an update of the original union compilation .",
    "it comprises 557 data points including recent large samples from other surveys and uses salt2 for sn ia light - curve fitting  @xcite .",
    "the sdss compilation of 288 sne ia uses both salt2 and mlcs2k2 light - curve fitters and is distributed in redshift interval @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "along with the sne ia data , and to diminish the degeneracy between the dark energy parameters @xmath65 , @xmath8 and @xmath22 , we also use the results of current bao and cmb experiments . for the bao measurements , we use the three estimates of the bao parameter @xmath66 at @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , as given in table 2 of ref",

    "we use only the measurement of the cmb shift parameter  @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 . in our analyses , we minimize the function @xmath74 , which takes into account all the data sets mentioned above and marginalize over the present value of the hubble parameter @xmath75 . for simplicity ,",
    "the combinations union2 + bao + cmb , sdss ( salt2 ) + bao + cmb and sdss ( mlcs2k2 ) + bao + cmb are denoted by c1 , c2 and c3 respectively .",

    "@xmath76 has been projected into the plane @xmath55 .",
    "panels 2a , 2b and 2c show contours of @xmath77 and 6.17 arising from the joint analyses c1 , c2 and c3 , respectively . with exception of c3",
    ", we note that no dark energy behavior is preferred or ruled out by observations , although the largest portion of the confidence contours lies into the blank region , which indicates a possible crossing of the so - called phanton divide line at some point of the cosmic evolution ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .",
