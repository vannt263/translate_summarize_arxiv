    "distributed algorithms have been extensively investigated in connection with the problems arising from sensor networks and networked systems for recent years , for example , consensus problem @xcite , distributed estimation @xcite , sensor localization @xcite , distributed optimization @xcite , distributed control @xcite and so on . the distributed algorithms work in the situation , where the goal is cooperatively accomplished by a multi - agent network with computation and communication abilities allocated in a distributed environment .",
    "their advantages over the centralized approaches for networked problems consist in enhancing the robustness of the networks , preserving privacy , and reducing the communication and computation costs .",
    "stochastic approximation ( sa ) was first considered in the work @xcite of robbins and monro for finding roots of a function with noisy observations , now it is known as the rm algorithm",
    ". then sa was used by kiefer and wolfowitz @xcite to estimate the maximum of an expectation function only with noisy function observations .",
    "sa has found wide applications in signal processing , communications and adaptive control , see , e.g.,@xcite .",
    "recently , many distributed problems are solved by sa - based distributed algorithms , e.g. , distributed parameter estimation @xcite , distributed convex optimization over random networks @xcite , and searching local minima of a non - convex objective function @xcite . as a result ,",
    "investigating the distributed algorithm for sa is also of great importance",
    ".    distributed stochastic approximation algorithms ( dsaa ) were proposed in @xcite to cooperatively find roots of a function , being a sum of local functions associated with agents in a multi - agent network .",
    "each agent updates its estimate for the root based on its local information composed of : 1 ) the observation of its local function possibly corrupted by noise and 2 ) the information obtained from its neighbors .",
    "the weak convergence for dsaa with constant step - size is investigated in @xcite , while the almost sure convergence for dsaa with decreasing step - size is studied in @xcite .",
    "performance gap between the distributed and the centralized stochastic approximation algorithms is investigated in @xcite . however , dsaa discussed in @xcite is in a different setting in comparison with @xcite .",
    "in fact , all components of the root - vector are estimated by each agent in @xcite , while in @xcite the components are separately estimated at different processors .    it is noticed that almost all aforementioned sa - based distributed algorithms require rather restrictive conditions to guarantee convergence for example , in @xcite it is required that each local function is globally lipschitz continuous and the observation noise is a martingale difference sequence ( mds ) . however , these conditions may not hold for some problems , e.g. , distributed principle component analysis and distributed gradient - free optimization to be discussed in section ii.b",
    ". this paper aims at solving the distributed root - seeking problem under weaker conditions in comparison with those used in @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we now consider the convergence of dsaawet applied to the distributed gradient - free optimization problem .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> in the paper , a novel distributed stochastic approximation algorithm ( dsaa ) is proposed to seek roots of the sum of local functions , each of which is associated with an agent from the multiple agents connected in a network . at any time , each agent updates its estimate for the root utilizing the observation of its local function and the information derived from the neighboring agents . </S>",
    "<S> the key difference of the proposed algorithm from the existing ones consists in the expanding truncations ( so it is called as dsaawet ) , by which the boundedness of the estimates can be guaranteed without imposing the growth rate constraints on the local functions . </S>",
    "<S> the convergence of the estimates generated by dsaawet to a consensus set belonging to the root set of the sum function is shown under weaker conditions on the local functions and on the observation noise in comparison with the existing results . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate our approach by two applications , one from signal processing and the other one from distributed optimization . </S>",
