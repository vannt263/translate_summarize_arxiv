    "hexagonal perovskites rmno@xmath0 ( r= ho , er , tm , yb , lu , y or sc ) belong to an unusual class of materials known as  multiferroics \" , which display simultaneously electric and magnetic ordering",
    ". most of the hexagonal manganites are ferroelectric below a very high temperature ( t@xmath1 900 k ) , and order magnetically at a lower temperature ( t@xmath2 100 k ) .",
    "a complex phase diagram involving different magnetic order parameters has been investigated using second harmonic generation @xcite , neutron scattering @xcite and heat capacity measurements @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most intriguing and technologically promising development is the recent observation of the magnetoelectric effect in the low temperature region of the phase diagram of homno@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "there are also indications of strong magneto - elastic coupling in homno@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the manganese and rare earth spins in rmno@xmath0 are nearly geometrically frustrated because of a slightly imperfect triangular lattice structure , however , complications often associated with frustration , such as spin liquid behaviour , are absent here . each magnetic phase is associated with a well - defined non - collinear spin structure within the hexagonal plane or antiferromagnetic ordering along the @xmath3-axis .",
    "the various magnetic phases have very similar antiferromagnetic ( af ) interaction energies , due to the almost perfect triangular lattice , which results in a close competition between them .    in each rmno@xmath0 ,",
    "the magnetic phase ` @xmath4 ' appears in zero magnetic field at the temperature t@xmath5 , while the phase ` @xmath6 ' develops in magnetic fields of the order of few tesla .",
    "these two phases are associated with ordering of mn@xmath7 spins within the hexagonal plane and are separated by a broad region of hysteresis .",
    "additional phases appear at low temperatures in homno@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "a sharp mn spin - reorientation transition occurs at t@xmath9 33 k , which results in the appearance of a third magnetic phase ` @xmath10 ' @xcite . below 33 k ,",
    "a new intermediate phase , which exhibits the magneto - electric effect , has been found in the region between the @xmath10 and @xmath4 phases @xcite .",
    "moreover , a fourth magnetic phase ` @xmath11 ' has been observed below 4 k due to ordering of ho@xmath7 spins @xcite .    in section",
    "ii we describe the spin structures associated with each magnetic phase , and the antiferromagnetic competition between them .",
    "section iii we present a landau model @xcite which describes the four magnetic phases seen experimentally and numerical simulations of phase diagrams derived from the model . in section iv we discuss our results .",
    "below t@xmath12 , hexagonal rmno@xmath0 has the space group symmetry p6@xmath0 cm ( # 185 , c@xmath13 ) @xcite",
    ". the crystal structure of rmno@xmath0 is shown in figure [ fig - structure]a ) . with six copies of the chemical formula per unit cell ,",
    "the mn@xmath7 ions occupy the ( 6c ) positions , and form triangular lattices on the @xmath14 and @xmath15 planes .",
    "the ( 6c ) positions are @xmath16 and equivalent , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 yields a perfect triangular lattice .",
    "the rare earth ions occupy ( 2a ) and ( 4b ) positions , which are @xmath20 ( and equivalent , with @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 ( and equivalent , with @xmath23 ) respectively .",
    "a perfect triangular lattice is formed when the two @xmath14-parameters are equal .",
    "the triangular lattices formed by the mn and rare earth ions are shown in figure [ fig - triangles ] .",
    "the point group c@xmath24 has four one - dimensional irreducible representations ( ir s ) , a@xmath25 , a@xmath26 , b@xmath25 and b@xmath26 , and two two - dimensional ir s e@xmath25 and e@xmath26 .",
    "the same notation is used to label magnetic representations , where characters of ` -1 ' in the character table of c@xmath24 indicate a combination of the point group element with time reversal @xcite . for the 1d representations ,",
    "the same names are given to the corresponding magnetic phases .",
    "in the presence of magnetic order parameters , the magnetic space groups are p6@xmath0 cm ( a@xmath27 ) , p6@xmath0 ( a@xmath26 ) , p@xmath0c ( b@xmath27 ) , and p@xmath0 m ( b@xmath26 ) .",
    "the spin configurations of rare - earth and mn ions may be classified according to the magnetic representations by which they transform .",
    "all configurations which transform according to 1d representations are listed in table  [ spins ] , where the spin subscripts refer to the atom numbers shown in figure [ fig - structure]b ) .",
    "the remaining degrees of freedom are accommodated by the 2d representations of c@xmath24 ; but so far , there is no evidence that phases corresponding to 2d op s appear in the phase diagram , so the 2d spin configurations are not included here .",
    ".1d spin configurations classified by irreducible representation .",
    "the rare earth spin configurations are shown in figure [ fig - hospins ] and the first four mn ( 6c ) configurations are shown in figure [ fig - spins ] . [ spins ] [ cols=\"^,^ , < \" , ]     we now discuss general features of the h - t phase diagrams of rmno@xmath0 by considering the relative strength of the nearest - neighbour antiferromagnetic interaction for each spin configuration in table [ spins ] .",
    "the antiferromagnetic interaction is defined as @xmath28 where the sum is over nearest neighbours and @xmath29 is a spin operator .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 depends on the distance between nearest neighbours .",
    "the first four configurations for mn ions listed in table [ spins ] and illustrated in figure [ fig - spins ] , confine the spins to the hexagonal plane . the @xmath4 phase that appears below @xmath31 , the @xmath6 phase found in magnetic fields , and the @xmath10 phase found at lower temperature in homno@xmath0",
    "are due to these configurations . in order to compare the af interaction strengths for the different configurations , first",
    ", sets of nearest neighbours should be separated into three cases , according to symmetry .",
    "the first case is the set of co - planar nearest neighbours ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 , numbered as in figure [ fig - structure]b ) ) . in this case",
    ", the af interaction is the same for all four configurations , @xmath34 .",
    "the second and third cases involve non - coplanar pairs .",
    "the second case pairs ions on opposite sides of the hexagonal primitive cell ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) and the third case is the remaining pairs .",
    "the second case favours @xmath11 and @xmath6 equally , while the third case favours @xmath10 and @xmath4 equally , with @xmath38 in both cases .",
    "the distance between partners in each pair for the second and third cases is exactly the same if the mn position parameter @xmath39 is exactly @xmath40 .",
    "deviations away from @xmath41 will favour either the @xmath42 phases or the @xmath43 phases .",
    "however , the observed behaviour is the opposite of what could be expected . at higher temperatures ( 75 k ) @xmath44 @xcite , which brings the second case pairs closer together and favours the @xmath42 phases , but the @xmath4 phase is observed .",
    "at the lowest temperature ( 1.5 k ) @xmath45 the @xmath43 phases are favoured but the @xmath11 phase is observed .",
    "the subtle competition between all four phases which results in the dominance of the @xmath4 phase at high temperatures is most likely to be resolved by the inclusion of other interactions , such as next - nearest - neighbour , or interactions with the rare - earth ions .",
    "( after @xcite ) .",
    "[ fig - spins],width=340 ]    in homno@xmath0 , additional phases @xmath10 followed by @xmath11 appear as the temperature is further lowered .",
    "the @xmath10 phase is associated both with in - plane mn moments and ho ordering along the @xmath3-axis .",
    "the ( 2a ) and ( 4b ) holmium ions are almost co - planar .",
    "the @xmath10 phase is af along the @xmath3-axis for ( 2a ) and ( 4b ) ions , but inside the hexagonal plane , the ( 4b ) ions are aligned ferromagnetically with each other , and antiferromagnetically with the ( 2a ) ions .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig - hospins]b ) .    at the lowest temperatures , the @xmath11 configuration emerges , which has af ordering of the ( 4b ) spins in in the planes and along the @xmath3-axis , as shown in figure [ fig - hospins]a ) .",
    "then , there can be no af arrangement with respect to the ( 2a ) positions ( because there is no @xmath11 configuration for them ) .",
    "the phase transition from @xmath10 to @xmath11 is first - order , as is the case between all transitions involving different order parameters , therefore hysteresis is anticipated , both on phenomenological grounds , and also because of the persistence of the @xmath10 configuration on the ( 2a ) positions .",
    "the total in - plane af interaction energy for all ho ions is approximately the same for all three configurations shown in figure [ fig - hospins ] . in all cases",
    "@xmath46 , but @xmath30 differs according to the distance between ions .",
    "if the ( 2a ) and ( 4b ) position parameters @xmath14 are equal then the three phases are degenerate , otherwise @xmath11 and @xmath4 have lower energy .",
    "the co - linear af interactions favour the @xmath10 configuration , with @xmath47 ( versus @xmath48 for @xmath11 and @xmath49 for @xmath4 ) .",
    "the @xmath6 phase will always dominate at high enough magnetic fields , since it transforms in the same way as the applied field , and couples linearly in the phenomenological sense .",
    "microscopically , zeeman coupling to mn or ho spins induces ferromagnetic order associated with the @xmath6 phase .",
    "the order parameters of the phases a@xmath25 , a@xmath50 , b@xmath27 and b@xmath50 are denoted by @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . the minimal landau model which describes the a@xmath26 and b@xmath26 phases , observed in all rmno@xmath0 , is @xmath55 where where @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are phenomenological coupling constants and @xmath60 is the magnetic field parallel to the @xmath3-axis .",
    "the coefficients @xmath61 are temperature dependent , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the temperature limit of stability for each phase ( which for convenience , we call the  transition temperature \" ) , and @xmath64 is required for stability . @xmath65 changes sign at @xmath66k in all rmno@xmath0 .    in zero",
    "applied field , the model allows for four different phases : @xmath67 ( the parent phase ) , which may be connected to either @xmath68 ( a@xmath26-phase ) , @xmath69 ( b@xmath26-phase ) or @xmath70 ( mixed phase ) by second order phase transitions .",
    "these are found by solving the set of coupled equations @xmath71 , subject to the minimisation conditions @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the model also allows for the coexistence of two or more different phases by hysteresis .    the mixed phase @xmath70 can be a minimum of @xmath74 only when @xmath75 .",
    "its existence is _ not _ the result of hysteresis .",
    "anomalies in the @xmath3-axis magnetisation at the b@xmath26 phase boundary @xcite are evidence that @xmath4 and @xmath6 are coupled ( _ i.e. _ @xmath76 ) . in general",
    ", @xmath52 grows linearly with applied field but it may still be subject to a transition in the sense that a change in sign of @xmath77 will increase the number of minima of the landau functional .",
    "additional order parameters @xmath78 and @xmath53 are required to describe the additional phases observed in homno@xmath0 .",
    "additional terms in the free energy include those obtained by replacing in ( [ 24 ] ) @xmath79 by @xmath80 and @xmath81 , as well as terms of the form @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the landau model describing a@xmath27 , a@xmath26 , b@xmath27 and b@xmath26 phases is @xmath84 this model may be solved exactly in zero applied field , and it is found that the allowed phases are @xmath85 ( the parent phase ) , @xmath86 _ etc . _ ( a@xmath87 or b@xmath87 ) and @xmath88 _ etc . _",
    "( mixed phases involving two order parameters ) .",
    "in addition , two or more phases may co - exist due to hysteresis .",
    "the models ( [ 24 ] ) and ( [ 1234 ] ) were analysed by varying the temperature and field and searching for the minima of @xmath74 numerically . typically , several minima were present , the deepest corresponding to the true ground state and the rest to metastable states observed as hysteresis .",
    "each set of parameters @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 yields a different phase diagram ; these parameters were varied to find the best match to phase diagrams obtained in experiments @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig - rmno3 ] shows numerical simulations of the phase diagrams for rmno@xmath0 , modeled by ( [ 24 ] ) . in all four diagrams ,",
    "the onset of the @xmath4 phase for @xmath93 is determined by setting @xmath94 k. below this temperature two minima corresponding to non - zero @xmath54 occur in ( [ 24 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath6 phase , which dominates the right side ( high field region ) of all diagrams , corresponds to a landau functional which has only _ one _ minimum that is shifted away from @xmath95 because of the term @xmath96 .",
    "thus the free energy resembles the parent phase but the symmetry is @xmath6 . in figures [ fig - rmno3]b ) , c ) and",
    "d ) hysteresis occurs , indicated by lighter coloured areas near the black phase boundary line . here",
    "the free energy has three minima , one corresponding to the field - shifted parent phase , and two to the @xmath4 phase . in figures [ fig - rmno3]a ) , b ) and d ) we have @xmath97 , so a pair of minima for @xmath98 never occurs .",
    "however , in figure [ fig - rmno3]c ) , @xmath99 , so two shallow minima for @xmath52 co - exist with two for @xmath54 in the bottom left corner of the phase diagram .",
    "figure [ fig - rmno3]b ) shows the correct arrangement of phases on the phase diagram compared to experiments , but fails to simulate correctly the curvature of the phase boundary .",
    "fig ure  [ fig - rmno3]d ) , which includes the non - linear ( in op ) field - dependent terms in ( [ 24 ] ) , is a significant improvement .",
    "+    figure [ fig - homno3 ] shows numerical simulations of the phase diagram of homno@xmath0 , modeled by ( [ 1234 ] ) . the upper part of the diagrams , showing the @xmath4 and @xmath6 phases ,",
    "is similar to rmno@xmath0 , in that the @xmath4 phase appears below the transition temperature @xmath100 k , and the @xmath6 phase is induced by the magnetic field .",
    "non - zero transition temperatures @xmath63 were assigned to all other phases ( @xmath101 k , @xmath102 k , @xmath103 k ) below which the phases are metastable and hysteresis occurs .",
    "true phase transitions occur below the transition temperatures , along the lines where the free energies , evaluated for different phases , are equal .",
    "different shades within a single phase represent the presence of other , metastable phases .",
    "figure [ fig - homno3]a ) bears a poor resemblance to experiments .",
    "figure [ fig - homno3]b ) , which includes non - linear field - dependent terms , is significantly better , but still fails to reproduce qualitatively all of the phase boundary around the @xmath10 phase as seen in experiments .",
    "in section [ sec - structure ] we argued that even in the absence of true geometrical frustration , there is not enough information to predict the magnetic ground state without detailed knowledge of the af interaction strength @xmath30 . in landau theory , the microscopic model ( [ af ] ) is replaced by a phenomenological one ( [ 24],[1234 ] ) , and the parameter @xmath30 is incorporated into the temperature - dependent @xmath56 .",
    "landau theory includes all interactions allowed by symmetry , and as such is more general than the af interaction , which is isotropic .",
    "however , the proliferation of phenomenological constants also inhibits the predictive powers of the landau model .",
    "nevertheless , landau modeling is useful because it can reveal the minimal elements in a theory that are needed to describe the phase diagrams of rmno@xmath0 . in our analysis",
    ", we found that a model based on the usual second and fourth order terms , and a linear coupling of the order parameter to the magnetic field , does not describe well the observed phase diagrams , especially the curvature of the phase boundaries .",
    "the inclusion of non - linear ( in op ) field - dependent terms is a significant improvement .",
    "the magneto - electric effect is observed in the region between the @xmath10 and @xmath4 phases .",
    "linear coupling of the magnetic and electric fields of the form @xmath104 can only occur when both inversion and time reversal symmetry are absent - these are necessary but not sufficient conditions .",
    "a mixture of @xmath10 and @xmath4 order parameters ( due to hysteresis ) does not lower the symmetry enough for magneto - electric coupling .",
    "however , domain walls , which connect different domains of the same phase , have been implicated in the observation of the magneto - electric effect @xcite .",
    "thus op gradient terms , which couple to the magnetic field , may significantly alter the free energy landscape , and could possibly replace the non - linear field - dependent terms which we introduced .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied phase diagrams for rmno@xmath0 , using group theory and landau theory , by including up to fourth order phenomenological couplings between order parameters and non - linear coupling to an applied magnetic field .",
    "antiferromagnetic competition between magnetic phases , due to a near perfect triangular lattice structure , gives rise to a complex phase diagram .",
    "our simulations reproduce the main features seen in experimental results , including the general arrangement of phases on the diagram , hysteresis effects and the curvature of phase boundaries .",
