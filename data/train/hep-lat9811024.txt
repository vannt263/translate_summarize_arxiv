    "this factor , analogous to a dielectric constant , is approximated by its zero - field - momentum zero - field - intensity limit  @xcite .",
    "our expression for the error in valence approximation vacuum expectation values consists of an expansion in quark - loop count and in powers of a coupling constant .",
    "the coupling constant expansion relies on ideas drawn from mean - field - improved perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "each term in the expansion requires as input the quantity @xmath0 given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the gauge coupling constant of full qcd and @xmath3 is the dielectric constant entering the valence approximation .",

    "the sum of all terms in the error expansion , in principle , gives the exact value of the valence approximation error for any choice of the @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , the expansion remains correct independent of the accuracy of the second order perturbative expression for @xmath0 . for a bad choice of @xmath0 ,",
