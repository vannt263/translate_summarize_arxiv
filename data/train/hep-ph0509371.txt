    "there is a general attitude in the collider physics community that small @xmath0 resummation is impossible to understand , but there is no need to worry since the data can be described very well without it .",
    "it is certainly true that ( for instance ) standard global parton fits  @xcite are based on fixed next - to - leading ( nlo ) order calculations , and that they manage to describe the data very accurately , in particular throughout the hera kinematic region .",
    "the lack of experimental evidence for higher - order perturbative corrections at small @xmath0 , despite theoretical arguments which suggest that they should be large , has been the motivation for a substantial amount of theoretical effort over the last decade .",
    "@xcite@xmath1@xcite this activity has become less of an academic exercise since the recent determination of the full set of nnlo splitting functions  @xcite and of the full set of @xmath2 perturbative corrections to deep - inelastic scattering .",
    "@xcite indeed , parton fits that include these nnlo terms  @xcite appear to be unstable at small @xmath0 : when @xmath3 the difference in results e.g. for the @xmath4 splitting function or for the gluon - dominated structure function @xmath5 when going from nnlo and nlo starts becoming as large or larger than the difference between nlo and lo .",
    "interestingly , it also turns out that at small @xmath0 there is a significant difference between the full nnlo result and the nominally leading small @xmath0 contributions : subleading terms are crucial .",
    "this means that , whatever the reason for the success of nlo fits , small @xmath0 resummation is mandatory beyond nllo , at least for @xmath6 .",
    "thanks to recent theoretical progress , there is now a consistent theory which enables small @xmath0 resummation , and which is close to being amenable to realistic phenomenology .",
    "this theory requires several ingredients , which were developed by various people over the last decade , and have recently led to two approaches ( abf  @xcite@xmath1@xcite and ccss  @xcite@xmath1@xcite ) which incorporate similar basic principles , and which arrive at stable and consistent resummed results . here",
    "we will mainly review the abf approach , while also comparing with the results of the ccss approach and briefly discussing differences between the two approaches .",
    "the main problems in small @xmath0 resummation of the standard glap evolution equations is first , that leading logarithmic resummation corrections are to be too large  they would lead to a powerlike small @xmath0 rise of splitting functions and thus of structure functions which is incompatible with the data ,  @xcite and second , that they are perturbatively unstable  the next - to - leading logarithmic resummation corrections are larger than the leading ones .    these problems are solved thanks to three main ingredients : duality  @xcite , which makes the joint resummation of collinear and small @xmath0 logs possible , running coupling small @xmath0 resummation  @xcite and factorization  @xcite , which softens the resummed small @xmath0 behaviour , and gluon exchange symmetry  @xcite which stabilizes the resummed perturbative expansion .",
    "as is well known , singlet splitting functions at small @xmath0 receive contributions of the form @xmath7 to all perturbative orders .",
    "these contributions can be extracted from the bfkl equation , which for a parton distribution @xmath8 ( in fact , an eigenvector of the singlet evolution matrix ) , and its mellin transforms @xmath9 takes the form @xmath10 of a standard renormalization - group ( or glap ) equation , @xmath11 but with the roles of the variables @xmath0 and @xmath12 interchanged .",
    "upon mellin transformation , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    whereas the way to extract the coefficients of the leading singular @xmath15 contributions to the anomalous dimension @xmath16 eq .  ( [ rge ] ) from the ( bfkl ) kernel @xmath17 of eq .",
    "( [ bfkl ] ) has been known since a long time,@xcite it has been realized only more recently  @xcite that in fact , up to higher twist corrections , the bfkl and glap equations admit the same solution , provided the boundary conditions are suitably matched , and the corresponding kernels satisfy the duality relations @xmath18 these relations hold at fixed coupling , whereas in the running case they are corrected by terms which may be computed order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "duality maps the expansion of @xmath19 in powers of @xmath20 at fixed @xmath21 ( in fig .  1 leading @xmath22 , next - to - leading @xmath23 etc . ) into the expansion of @xmath24 in powers of of @xmath20 at fixed @xmath25 ( in fig .  1 leading @xmath26 , next - to - leading @xmath27 etc .",
    ") : hence @xmath22 or @xmath26 sum leading logs of @xmath12 ( collinear logs ) while @xmath28 or @xmath29 sum leading logs of @xmath30 ( energy logs ) and so on .",
    "a joint ( double - leading ) resummation can be constructed by simply combining the two expansions and subtracting the terms which are in common : so the lo dl anomalous dimension is @xmath31 and so on .",
    "a nontrivial property of the dl expansion is that the dual of lo dl @xmath24 is lo dl @xmath19 ( up to subleading terms ) , and similarly at next - to - leading order and so on .",
    "the dl expansion allows one to understand and cure the notorious problem of the large size of subleading @xmath32 in comparison to leading @xmath29 , seen in fig.2 , where bfkl lo denotes @xmath33 and bfkl nlo denotes @xmath34 .",
    "indeed , momentum conservation implies that to all perturbative orders @xmath35 . by duality",
    "this also implies @xmath36 .",
    "but @xmath24 is a polynomial in @xmath20 , so @xmath36 means that as @xmath37 @xmath24 must behave as @xmath38 up to subleading corrections .",
    "hence the expansion of @xmath24 in powers of @xmath20 has alternating - sign poles at @xmath39 , which are resummed into @xmath26 and thus absent in double - leading @xmath24 .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "2 also displays the dl lo and nlo curves , which agree respectively with lo and nlo glap when @xmath40 , and with lo and nlo bfkl when @xmath41 .",
    "hence , the dl expansion is stable for all @xmath42 .",
    "the running of the coupling @xmath43 $ ] is a leading log @xmath12 , but next  to  leading log @xmath30 effect . as a consequence , beyond ll@xmath0",
    "the fixed - coupling duality relations  ( [ dual ] ) get corrected : for instance @xmath44 determined from @xmath29 and @xmath32 according to eq .",
    "( [ dual ] ) must be supplemented by a running - coupling correction @xmath45 .",
    "one can view these running coupling corrections as a contribution to an `` effective '' @xmath24 which then respects the duality relation  ( [ dual ] ) even at the running coupling level .",
    "the good thing about these running coupling correction is that one can show that through their inclusion duality between the bfkl and glap equations holds to all perturbative orders .",
    "this means that the running - coupling bfkl equation , just like the glap equation , admits a factorized solution , whose scale dependence is determined by the kernel independent of the boundary condition .",
    "@xcite the bad thing is that the associate effective @xmath24 is singular at the minimum of the fixed - coupling lo @xmath24 , as shown in fig .",
    "this singularity implies that the associate splitting function grows as a power of @xmath46 in comparison to the leading - order one as @xmath47 : at @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "these singularities must therefore be resummed to all orders if one wishes the @xmath47 limit to be stable .    -0.5",
    "cm    the resummation can be accomplished in an asymptotic expansion ,  @xcite it leads to the nonsingular result of fig .  3 , and it has a further interesting consequence .",
    "namely , if @xmath24 has a minimum , duality implies that @xmath19 has a cut : e.g. if @xmath24 is quadratic , then @xmath19 has a square - root cut . after running coupling resummation , however , the cut in @xmath19 is replaced by a simple pole ( fig .  3 ,",
    "interestingly , the pole is located on the real axis to the left of the cut , as seen in fig .  3 where a cut at @xmath50 leads to a pole at @xmath51 .",
    "because the location @xmath52 of the rightmost singularity in @xmath19 implies a small @xmath0 behaviour of parton distributions @xmath53 this means that running coupling corrections considerably soften the resummed small @xmath0 behaviour , a result first obtained in ref .  .",
    "the double - leading perturbative expansion of @xmath17 is stable for @xmath42 , but still unstable in the vicinity of @xmath54 , where it has alternating - sign poles . in particular",
    ", it will lack a minimum at even perturbative orders .",
    "this is problematic for the running coupling resummation discussed in the previous section , which relies on the existence of a minimum .",
    "the instability at @xmath54 can be understood  @xcite and cured  @xcite on the basis of the observation that in fact , due to the symmetry of the underlying feynman diagrams upon interchange of incoming and outgoing gluons , the bfkl kernel is symmetric about @xmath55 , i.e. @xmath56 .",
    "this symmetry is broken by the dis choice of kinematical variables , which treats asymmetrically the initial and final parton virtualities @xmath57 and @xmath12 , but it can be restored by choosing e.g. @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the center - of - mass energy of the partonic process .",
    "it is also broken by the asymmetric choice of scale in running of the coupling @xmath60 .",
    "these symmetry breaking effects are computable and can be undone :  @xcite once the symmetry is restored , one can symmetrize the dl expansion of @xmath24 , thereby obtaining a kernel which is perturbatively stable and free of poles at both @xmath39 and @xmath54 .",
    "in fact , the momentum conservation constraints implies that symmetrized @xmath24 is an entire function of @xmath61 , and has a minimum to all orders .",
    "the symmetrized dl expansion of @xmath24 which ensues is displayed in fig .  4 , where one sees that the powerful combination of duality and gluon symmetry leads to a stable expansion : the lo and nlo approximations are quite close .",
    "one can then revert to dis variables ( fig .  4 ,",
    "right ) , thus obtaining the kernel which lead through duality and running coupling resummation to an anomalous dimension and splitting function .",
    "interestingly , symmetrization implies a further softening of the kernel : the minimum of @xmath24 , hence the branch cut of the corresponding @xmath19 , is moved ( for @xmath62 ) from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "note that the nlo resummed behaviour is now harder than the lo one .    -.6",
    "cm    -.4 cm    the combination of symmetrization and running - coupling duality can be exploited to obtain powerful analytic results .",
    "for instance , one can use the knowledge of @xmath19 up to nnlo  @xcite to determine  @xcite all singular contributions to nnlo @xmath24 , as shown in fig .  6 .",
    "this requires a treatment of running - coupling corrections up to nlo , and of various interference terms , which is feasible if running coupling duality equations are solved in an operator approach .",
    "-.3 cm    various approximations to the splitting function are displayed in fig .  6 , determined with @xmath65 in order to avoid problems related to the diagonalization of the splitting function matrix .",
    "the glap lo and nlo results are very close to each other and coincide at small @xmath0 ( their small difference is proportional to @xmath66 ) , but the nnlo glap result is seen to be unstable at small @xmath0 because of an unresummed @xmath67 term ( with negative coefficient ) . the simple ( lo ) fixed - coupling double leading result ( dl fix in fig .",
    "6 ) displays a dramatic rise @xmath68 which is certainly not seen in the data .",
    "this is considerably softened by the running coupling resummation ( ` dl run ' in fig .",
    "a yet softer behaviour is obtained if the running coupling resummation is applied to the symmetrized result ( ` res lo ' and ` res nlo ' in fig .",
    "6 ) , which also leads to a stable perturbative expansion .    for comparison the nlo curve ( i.e. including nlo resummation of @xmath46 and @xmath69 ) obtained by ccss  @xcite is also shown .",
    "the ccss approach starts from the bfkl equation , with the aim of determining the off - shell gluon density , not just the anomalous dimensions of parton distributions .",
    "this is then improved by enforcing symmetry , matching to glap ( analogous to duality ) , and running coupling .",
    "the main advantages of this approach are its somewhat wider scope , and the fact that , being based on the bfkl equation , it allows for an exact treatment of the running coupling at small @xmath0 ( unlike the abf approach , where it is determined through an asymptotic expansion ) .",
    "the main disadvantages are that , due to the latter feature , anomalous dimensions can only be obtained through a numerical deconvolution procedure , and due to the former feature the perturbative expansion of the anomalous dimension is not naturally organized as a leading log series ( unlike the dl approach ) , which implies for instance that the full nlo @xmath70 result in this approach is not yet available .",
    "the nlo abf and ccss results turn out to be quite close : their difference can be taken as an estimate of the intrinsic uncertainty in the resummation procedure .",
    "these results are now essentially ready for a phenomenological implementation , though this will require the further development of suitable tools , such as matched resummed coefficient functions ( for which all the required theoretical information is available ) , and interpolation of the resummed results for their efficient numerical implementation .",
