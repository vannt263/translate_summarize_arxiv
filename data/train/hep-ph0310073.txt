    "@xmath8 violation has been a puzzling phenomenon in the studies of elementary particle physics since the first observation of its effects in hadronic kaon decays almost four decades ago @xcite . in the standard model ( sm ) , @xmath8-violation is due entirely to the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mechanism @xcite , describing the mismatch between the unitary transformations relating the up and down type quark mass eigenstates to the corresponding weak eigenstates .",
    "the ckm matrix involves a single weak phase along with three mixing angles .",
    "the validity of the ckm picture is further strengthened by the fact that recent @xmath9 measurements from time - dependent @xmath8 asymmetries of decay modes involving the @xmath10 subprocess @xcite agree well with the range of the weak phase @xmath11 from many other constraints @xcite .",
    "however , it is still unknown whether there are any other sources that may give rise to @xmath8-violating effects .",
    "good places to search for deviations from the sm predictions are decay processes that are expected to be rare in the sm , which may reveal new physics through interference effects .",
    "in particular , discrepancies among the time - dependent @xmath8 asymmetries of different @xmath1 decay modes may show evidence for new physics @xcite .",
    "recently , an anomaly was reported in the time - dependent @xmath8 asymmetry measurement of the @xmath12 decay mode . within the framework of the sm",
    ", this process should also provide us with information on the weak phase @xmath11 , up to about @xmath13 theoretical uncertainty @xcite .",
    "however , the averaged value of @xmath6 reported by the babar and belle groups is @xcite ( individual measurements to be quoted in table [ tab : data ] ) s_k_s = -0.147 0.697 ( s=2.11 )  .",
    "this result is only about @xmath14 away from the corresponding quantity measured by the @xmath15 mode , @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "however , the scale factor @xmath17 suggests a discrepancy between the two experimental groups . before this discrepancy",
    "is settled , the difference between @xmath6 and @xmath18 suggests the possibility of new physics contributions . from the theoretical point of view , the @xmath19 decay is a loop - induced process involving @xmath20 penguin operators in the sm .",
    "therefore , it is susceptible to new physics contributions even if they are suppressed by a large mass parameter which characterizes the new physics scale .",
    "in addition to model - independent approaches @xcite , many studies have been made to explain the anomaly in supersymmetric and related models @xcite .",
    "such an effect can also be explained using models in which the bottom quark is mixed with heavy mirror fermions with masses of the order of the weak scale @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to show that a new physics effect of similar size can be obtained from some models with an extra @xmath5 boson .",
    "@xmath5 bosons are known to naturally exist in well - motivated extensions of the sm @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 mass is constrained by direct searches at fermilab , weak neutral current data , and precision studies at lep and the slc @xcite , which give a model - dependent lower bound around 500 gev .",
    "the latter also severely limits the @xmath21-@xmath5 mixing angle @xmath22 a few @xmath23",
    ". a  could be relevant to the nutev experiment  @xcite and , if the couplings are not family universal  @xcite , to the anomalous value of the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "( earlier hints of a discrepancy in atomic parity violation have largely disappeared due to improved calculations of radiative corrections  @xcite . )",
    "we therefore study the @xmath5 boson in the mass range of a few hundred gev to 1 tev , assuming no mixing between @xmath21 and @xmath5 .",
    "interesting phenomena arise when the @xmath5 couplings to physical fermion eigenstates are non - diagonal .",
    "this is possible if there exist additional exotic fermions that have different @xmath0 charges from the ordinary fermions , as found in @xmath25 models @xcite .",
    "however , in these models left - handed fermion mixings may induce undesirable flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) mediated by the @xmath21 boson even in the absence of @xmath21-@xmath5 mixing or nonuniversal family couplings .",
    "one can avoid this consequence by confining the mixing to be between right - handed fermions and the exotic quarks @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "other models give family nonuniversal @xmath5 couplings as a result of different ways of constructing families in some string models @xcite .",
    "fcnc and possibly new @xmath8-violating phenomena will also occur in these models after fermion mixings are taken into account .",
    "these can occur for both left and right - handed fermions .",
    "although experiments on fcnc processes ( such as the mass difference between @xmath26 and @xmath27 and the @xmath28 decay ) have significantly constrained the @xmath5 couplings of the first and second generation quarks to be almost the same and diagonal , the couplings to the third generation are not well constrained .",
    "similar statements apply to the charged leptons .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that indeed the third generation fermions can have different @xmath5 couplings from the other two generations .",

    "we find that a sizeable weak phase associated with the @xmath63 coupling is favored in the ranges of @xmath210 , depending upon the @xmath126 and @xmath39 parameter choices .",

    "combining with the constraints from the @xmath74 decays , @xmath212 and @xmath185 , we find that a value of @xmath118 around @xmath191 is favored .    we have observed that the @xmath8 asymmetries of the @xmath143 mode are more sensitive to the  effects than the @xmath213 decay .",
    "this is because of a cancellation between different parts ( @xmath123 versus @xmath214 and @xmath215 ) in the @xmath164 wavefunction .",
