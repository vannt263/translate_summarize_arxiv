    "traditionally , high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) have been divided in three classes : `` classical '' bright ( @xmath0 ) sources fed by incipient localised roche lobe overflow , be / x - ray binaries , presenting different behaviours but always associated to the presence of a circumstellar decretion disk , and wind - fed supergiant x - ray binaries ( sgxbs ) . in the last group , the compact object is fed by accretion from the strong radiative wind of an ob supergiant , leading to a persistent x - ray source with @xmath1 , displaying large variations on short timescales , but a rather stable flux in the long run . the compact object is a relatively close ( @xmath2 ) orbit with low or negligible eccentricity .    over the last few years , there has been a huge increase in the number of hmxbs known ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "many new sources have been found to display very brief outbursts , with a rise timescale of tens of minutes and lasting only a few hours @xcite .",
    "several have been identified with ob supergiants : ( e.g. , the prototype xte  j1739@xmath3302 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the distances to their counterparts imply typical @xmath1 at the peak of the outbursts .",
    "a number of other systems have been shown to have similar x - ray behaviours leading to the definition of a class of supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts ) @xcite .",
    "around 12 such systems are known @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps possible to divide them in two groups , the first one characterised by very low quiescence @xmath4 and high variability and the second one with higher average @xmath4 and smaller variability factors .",
    "the second group , then , could be thought of as persistent sgxbs with an average @xmath4 below the canonical @xmath5 over which flares are superimposed @xcite . to some degree , this distinction may be due to observational biases ( cf . the case of xte  j1739@xmath3302 ; blay et al . ,",
    "submitted ) . in any case , it is clear that the separation between sfxts and sgxbs is not well defined .",
    "two other systems have shown flaring only during episodes separated by regular intervals : igr j00370 + 6122 @xcite and igr j11215 - 5952 @xcite .",
    "this modulation is most likely related to an orbital period .",
    "because of their very different properties , we do not count these two systems as sfxts , but they are also wind - fed accretors and any theory attempting an explanation to the behaviour of sfxts must take into account the existence of other wind accretors .",
    "at least two sfxts have been observed to increase their @xmath6 by a factor @xmath7 ( going from deep quiescence to outburst ) in only a few minutes : xte  j1739@xmath3302 @xcite and igr  j17544@xmath32619 @xcite .",
    "ax  j1841.0@xmath30535 showed a @xmath8 increase in count - rate over @xmath9h @xcite .",
    "such sharp rises are incompatible with any explanation of their behaviour based solely on orbital motion through a smooth medium .",
    "radiation - driven winds from hot stars obey complex physics @xcite .",
    "the outflow is driven by line scattering of the continuum radiation flux from the central star .",
    "material is accelerated outwards from the stellar atmosphere to a final velocity @xmath10 according to a law that may be approximated as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the radius of the supergiant and @xmath13 is a factor generally lying in the interval @xmath14 .",
    "the accretion rate ( @xmath15 ) of a neutron star immersed in such a wind depends on its accretion radius , the maximum distance at which its gravitational potential well can deflect the stellar wind and focus the outflowing material towards the neutron star . on first approximation ,",
    "this is given by @xmath16 where the relative velocity of the accreted material with respect to the neutron star is @xmath17 .",
    "for typical values of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , decreasing by a factor of a few from @xmath20 to @xmath21 . under these conditions",
    ", @xmath22 the details of wind accretion are not well understood . in the classical bondi - hoyle formulation , accreted material lacks enough angular momentum to form a stable accretion disk that can provide torque to the compact object .",
    "neutron stars in many sgxbs alternate spin - up and spin - down episodes , resembling a random walk @xcite .",
    "complex simulations of the accretion process ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) are unable to quantify how much angular momentum is accreted from a wind",
    ".    direct application of this formulation implies that sgxbs must display a wide range of x - ray behaviours and @xmath4 , depending on orbital characteristics . in contrast , all known sgxbs have about the same @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , all sgxbs known have their compact objects orbiting the supergiant at @xmath23 .",
    "the actual situation in real sgxbs is much more complex than the toy model represented by these simple equations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the lack of a distribution in @xmath6 amongst sgxbs is still unexpected if winds are smooth .",
    "because of its very nature , radiation - driven winds from hot stars must be highly unstable to small - scale perturbations .",
    "simulations suggest that irregular variations in both density and velocity develop at a small height above the photosphere , leading to the appearance of structure within the wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the variations steepen into shocks that decelerate and compress rarefied gas , collecting most of the mass into a sequence of dense clumps bounded by shocks .",
    "indirect observational evidence supports the existence of clumps within the wind , though the actual physical parameters ( size , geometry , density ) of the clumps are ill - determined @xcite .",
    "clumpiness may provide an explanation for the behaviour of sfxts , as the wind would be composed of dense clumps ( with a density contrast with respect to the corresponding smooth wind model @xmath24 ) separated by effectively void space .",
    "we can identify each outburst from an sfxt as due to the accretion of a single clump , assuming , like @xcite , that the x - ray lightcurve is a direct tracer of the density distribution in the wind . alternatively ,",
    "if the accretion process is very complex , a number of physical mechanisms may mediate , such as the centrifugal effect of a neutron s star magnetic field , as suggested by @xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath4 is not a direct tracer of @xmath25 .",
    "our current understanding of wind accretion supports the first scenario , as accretion disks seem difficult to form and the @xmath26 distribution of sgxbs does not suggest an effective transfer of angular momentum from wind to accreting object @xcite .",
    "therefore we will investigate the wind distribution that would be directly traced by the observed @xmath4 .",
    "we calculate the clump distribution for the inner wind within the model of @xcite , though we do not expect the choice of model to be determinant . in this formulation",
    ", the number of clumps within a spherical shell of width @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the flight time that the wind takes to go through @xmath27 , expressed in units of the dynamical timescale @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the porosity length .",
    "we consider that a clump can be accreted if it is at a distance @xmath32 from the compact object . for typical sizes of ob supergiants , @xmath33 ,",
    "and we can approximate the flight time as @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "now we distribute the clumps uniformly over the shell to produce a volume density of clumps @xmath36 ( we assume the shell to be spherical ) .",
    "finally , we compute the number of clumps within a ring of height @xmath37 inside this shell ( itself of width @xmath37 ) as @xmath38 . @xmath39 gives an indication of the number of clumps that the neutron star is _ statistically _ able to accrete in one orbit .",
    "values of @xmath39 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ clumps_distance ] for typical parameters of o and b supergiants .",
    "the _ shape _ of the distribution , which does not depend on @xmath31 and only weakly on wind parameters ( within a sensible range ) suffers a change in the slope at a distance @xmath40 .",
    "this change is so abrupt that it effectively defines a two - regime scenario . at this distance",
    ", the distribution tends to a _ vertical asymptote _ , which separates a region where the neutron star sees a very large number of clumps in the wind from a region where the number density of clumps is so small that the neutron star is effectively in empty space .",
    "systems in which the neutron star orbits the supergiant at smaller distances than this asymptote are effectively embedded in a quasi - continuous wind .",
    "systems outside the discontinuity spend most of the time in an effective vacuum . on this side",
    ", the number of clumps that the neutron star encounters in one orbit must be very small .    in terms of the model",
    ", the interpretation of this shape is simple . at @xmath41 ,",
    "the wind has reached a significant fraction of its final velocity . for smaller values of @xmath42 , @xmath43 becomes large , reflecting the decrease in @xmath44 ( and hence @xmath45 ) .",
    "at the same time , close to the star , the wind occupies a smaller volume .",
    "the asymptote reflects the fact that , for sufficiently small @xmath42 , @xmath46 becomes comparable in size to the volume filled by the wind .",
    "in other words , the neutron star becomes able to `` see '' a significant fraction of all the clumps coming out from the star .",
    "conversely , at large distances , the wind fills a much larger volume and the neutron star only `` sees '' a very small portion of this volume .",
    "obviously , the asymptote is due to the mathematical formulation of the problem in a simple approximation , but it has a clear physical interpretation in terms of the capability of the neutron star to accrete . in spite of its simplicity , this basic model of a porous wind predicts a substantial change in the properties of the wind `` as seen by an orbiting neutron star '' at a distance @xmath47 , exactly where we stop seeing persistent x - ray sources .",
    "the scheme presented here not only provides a simple explanation for the behaviour of sfxts , but also the observed distributions of sgxbs .",
    "moreover , it naturally implies a smooth transition between sgxbs and sfxts and the existence of intermediate systems . as a matter of fact , as shown in fig .",
    "[ representation ] , all wind accretors can smugly fit within this picture .    the values of @xmath31 required to reproduce the observed outburst frequency in sfxts are relatively low ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "such values are in good agreement with those required by @xcite to fit uv line profiles . taken at face value , they imply a very high degree of porosity ( macroclumping ) . however , this is not the only possible interpretation .",
    "a minimal mediation by the accretion process ( for example , if accretion is centrifugally inhibited for very low wind densities ) would probably allow the observed x - ray behaviour even with rather smaller porosity parameters .    under the assumptions presented here ,",
    "the observed division of hard x - ray supergiant sources into persistent sgxbs , sfxts and regular outbursters can be naturally explained by simple geometrical differences in their orbital configurations ."
