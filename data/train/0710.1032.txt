    "population iii stars formed in the early universe at redshift @xmath5 with a top - heavy initial mass function ( e.g. see @xcite ) are expected to leave at the end of their lives intermediate mass black remnants of the order of @xmath6 .",
    "these seeds , formed within dark matter halos of mass @xmath7 , may be the starting points for accretion that will lead to supermassive black holes ( @xmath8 ) , which are considered to power the luminosity of qsos , observed in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) at @xmath9 when the universe was less than one billion years old ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "these bright qsos are extremely rare objects ( one object per about 200 deg@xmath10 in sdss , see @xcite ) , so we expect on average one per 1gpc@xmath11 comoving .    within this volume",
    "the qso may either be the descendant of the first intermediate mass black hole seed left from the _ first _ popiii star , which would therefore give the most time for mass accretion , or sit at the center of the most massive structure at @xmath1 .",
    "of course these two alternatives are in principle mutually non - exclusive , as the remnants of the first popiii stars could end up in the most massive dark matter halos at @xmath12 .",
    "this possibility seems to be implied by a number of recent papers , where the progenitor halos of bright quasars are traced back in time and identified as the first dark matter halos formed in the universe ( e.g. see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however these works either do not have the mass resolution to identify the dark matters halos hosting the first generation of popiii stars or rely on multiple mesh refinements of a small region centered around the largest halos identified at z=0 in order to resolve scales down to @xmath13 .    to properly address the link between bright quasars and popiii stars it is necessary to resolve a dynamic range in mass of more than @xmath14 : a simulation box of 1 gpc@xmath11 contains a mass larger than @xmath15 and within this box dark matter halos below @xmath16",
    "need to be identified .",
    "therefore we have adopted an original approach ( see @xcite ) , broadly based on the tree method by @xcite .",
    "the idea is based on coupling a numerical simulations of structure formation to identify dark matter halos at @xmath17 with a monte carlo method to sample subgrid fluctuations of the initial gaussian random field of density fluctuations at the mass scale typical of halos hosting popiii .",
    "this allows us to attach to every particle in the simulation , which has typically a mass in excess of @xmath18 , the formation time of its first popiii star progenitor .",
    "the details of the method are presented in detail in @xcite along with an extensive set of tests to validate our innovative approach . here",
    "we focus instead on summarizing the main results from our investigation .",
    "in particular we show that the first popiii progenitor of a @xmath3 bright qso , while born at @xmath19 well within the early era of popiii formation , it is not the first popiii in the typical gpc@xmath11 volume occupied by the qso , but it is rather preceded by about @xmath20 other popiii stars .",
    "a qualitative understanding can be reached from simple considerations based on the properties of gaussian random fields deriving from the spectrum of primordial density perturbations : small mass dark matter halos are sensitive to higher frequency in the density fluctuations spectrum than their higher mass counterparts .",
    "therefore the first @xmath13 dark matter halos formed at @xmath21 in a simulation box will not in general evolve to become the first @xmath22 dark matter halos formed at @xmath12 .    in terms of intermediate mass black hole growth from popiii",
    "this result implies that there are a number of seeds formed in the early universe before the one that will become the bright z=6 qso .",
    "all these seeds have enough time , if accreting at eddington limit with accretion efficiency @xmath23 to become supermassive ( @xmath24 ) by z=6 .",
    "we follow their evolution and we show with a simple accretion model that the gas supply available for growth is limited for most of these seeds , so that the qso luminosity function derived in our framework is consistent with the slope of the observed qso luminosity function",
    ".     for the oldest popiii progenitor ( with @xmath25 ) of the most massive halo ( black line ) and averaged over the 10 most massive halos ( red line ) at @xmath3 in the @xmath26 box simulation .",
    "the blue line represents the collapse redshift of the _ first _ popiii star perturbation , while the dotted green line refers to the collapse redshift of the 100th popiii in the box . ]",
    "we identify the largest dark matter halos at @xmath3 in three cosmological simulations with @xmath27 particles and different box sizes : a large ( edge @xmath28 mpc / h ) , a medium ( edge @xmath29 mpc / h ) and a small ( edge @xmath30 mpc / h ) box .",
    "the simulations have been carried out with the public version of the tree - pm code gadget2 @xcite and a cosmology based on third year wmap data @xcite : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the total matter density in units of the critical density ( @xmath35 ) with @xmath36 being the hubble constant ( parameterized as @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 the newton s gravitational constant .. @xmath39 is the dark energy density . in generating the initial density field",
    "we use a scale invariant long - wave spectral index ( @xmath40 ) of the power spectrum of density fluctuations and @xmath41 or @xmath42 ( the root mean squared mass fluctuation in a sphere of radius @xmath43 extrapolated at @xmath44 using linear theory ) .",
    "as described in @xcite , the initial density field is then used as input in our monte carlo code to obtain the formation redshift of the first popiii progenitor of each particle in the simulation box .",
    "in the @xmath26 box simulation . ]    under the assumption that the first popiii stars in the universe have formed in @xmath13 halos cooled by molecular hydrogen , the progenitor of the most massive @xmath3 halo ( the one assumed to host the bright qso ) in our large box simulation is born at @xmath45 , while the first popiii in the volume is already present at @xmath46 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : red720 ] ) . by the time the qso progenitor is born , there are on average 8000 other popiii stars formed in the simulation ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : card720 ] ) , with a typical popiii star formation rate , as obtained from our method , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr ] .",
    "if popiii stars reside in halos of different mass and/or if the value of @xmath47 is different , there will be a shift on the formation time of these first stars ( that is on the scale of the x - axis in figs .",
    "[ fig : red720]-[fig : sfr ] ) , but the relative ranking between the _ first _ popiii star in the box and the popiii that is the qso progenitor remains essentially unchanged ( e.g. see fig .  3 in @xcite ) .    ) per unit redshift versus redshift for @xmath48 as measured by means of our mc code . ]",
    "the relation between popiii and qsos can be easily understood in terms of the statistics of gaussian random fields ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pdf ] ) .",
    "in fact , the most massive @xmath3 halo in the simulation box ( with mass @xmath49 ) originates from a @xmath50 peak in the density perturbation field . if we know consider a random volume in the simulation box with mass @xmath51 , we find that the distribution for the maximum peak at the mass scale of a popiii halo ( @xmath13 ) inside this volume is in the range @xmath52 \\sigma(m_{qh})$ ] at the 90% confidence level .",
    "this is essentially because ( i ) we are at a smaller mass scale , so there is additional power in the density fluctuations field and ( ii ) we are considering here the first popiii halo formed in the @xmath51 volume , that is the maximum among @xmath53 fluctuations .",
    "the probability distribution for the peak associated to the first popiii progenitor of the qso ( green dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] ) is then given by combining the probability distribution of the qso overdensity with that of the first popiii halo of a random cell . from fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] it is immediately apparent that the advantage of sitting at the top of the qso overdensity is not sufficient for the first popiii in this volume to beat all other popiii in the box .",
    "still one in about @xmath54 popiii progenitors of random @xmath51 cells in the ( 720 mpc / h)@xmath11 box is formed before the qso progenitor .",
    "as there are @xmath55 cells of mass @xmath51 in this volume , we expect from this simple consideration that the popiii progenitor of the qso will be formed when already @xmath56 other popiii stars are present in the box , in excellent agreement with the detailed results from the numerical simulation ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : card720 ] ) .",
    "this result is essentially given by the fact that bright qsos at @xmath3 are very rare objects . if fact , if we consider a smaller cosmic volume ( e.g. a box of edge @xmath30 mpc / h ) and repeat the experiment of studying the formation time of the first popiii progenitor of the most massive @xmath3 halo , we find different results ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : red60 ] ) . in this case",
    "the cosmic volume considered is significantly smaller , so sitting at the top of the most massive @xmath3 halo gives a significant relative advantage to popiii formation at @xmath57 : the popiii progenitor of the most massive halo is typically within the first 10 to 100 popiii in the box .     for the maximum @xmath58 of @xmath59 random gaussian fluctuations representative of mass scale for halos hosting @xmath3 qso candidates ( red curve ) and popiii stars ( black curve ) . to compute @xmath60 for qso hosting halos",
    "we have assumed a box of @xmath61 and a mass scale of @xmath62 which implies @xmath63 .",
    "this curve represents the probability distribution for a sigma peak that at @xmath64 leads to one of the most massive halos in the simulation volume .",
    "the curve associated to first light perturbations ( solid black , with @xmath65 ) is derived using @xmath66 and @xmath67 : it represents the probability distribution for the maximum of the sub - grid scale fluctuations at the @xmath68 scale within one cell of the @xmath69 volume .",
    "the dashed green line represents the probability distribution of the density fluctuation associated to the first popiii progenitor of a @xmath70 peak .",
    "@xmath58 is given in units of @xmath71 . ]    , but for a smaller box simulation , with volume of @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "given the limited volume available sitting on the top of the overdensity that will collapse to the largest @xmath3 halo gives a significant advantage to popiii halos formed at @xmath57 , which are typically within the first 100 formed in the box . ]",
    "from our investigation it is clear that , before the first popiii progenitor of the most massive halo at @xmath3 is born , several thousands of intermediate mass ( @xmath74 ) black hole seeds are planted by popiii stars formed in a cosmic volume that will on average host a bright @xmath3 quasar .",
    "here we investigate with a simple merger tree code what is the fate of the black holes seeds formed up to the formation time of the quasar seed and what are the implications for the observed quasar luminosity function .",
    "we assume eddington accretion for the bh seeds , so that the evolution of the bh mass is given by : @xmath75},\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the mass at formation time @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the salpeter time @xcite : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the radiative efficiency .    if @xmath23 there has been enough time to build up a @xmath12 supermassive black hole with mass @xmath81 starting from a popiii remnant formed at @xmath19 .",
    "this highlights that only a minor fraction of the popiii bh seeds formed before @xmath82 can accrue mass with high efficiency , otherwise the number density of supermassive black holes at low redshift would greatly exceed the observational constraints .",
    "the first bh seeds in the box are distant from each other , so they evolve in relative isolation , without possibly merging among themselves .",
    "therefore other mechanisms must be responsible for quenching accretion of the first bh seeds .",
    "interestingly if we were to assume that accretion periods are poisson distributed in time for each seed , we would not be able to explain the observed power law distribution of bh masses at @xmath83 around the high mass end .",
    "a poisson distribution would in fact give too little scatter around the median value and a sharp ( faster than exponential ) decay of the displacements from the mean accreted mass .",
    "an exponential distribution of the accretion efficiency is instead required to match the observed bh mass function .",
    "in addition , it is necessary to assume that the duty cycle of the bh accretion is roughly proportional to the mass of the halo it resides in . to explore this possibility",
    "we follow the merging history of popiii halos formed at @xmath82 by means of a merger - tree code .",
    "we implement a bh growth based on eq .",
    "[ eq : accr ] , but at each step of the tree we limit the bh mass to @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the total baryon mass of the halo that hosts the bh . if @xmath86 ( like in @xcite ) , then we obtain an expected mass for the bh powering bright @xmath3 quasar of @xmath87 , which is in agreement with the observational constraints from sdss quasars @xcite . by fitting a power law function to the bh mass function in the range @xmath88\\cdot 10^{10 } m_{\\odot}$ ]",
    "we obtain a slope @xmath89 , while the slope is @xmath90 in the mass range @xmath91 \\cdot 10^{10 } m_{\\odot}$ ] , a value that is consistent within the @xmath92 error bar with the slope of the bright end of the quasar luminosity function measured by @xcite .",
    "we study the link between the first popiii halos collapsed in a simulation box and the most massive structures at @xmath17 , with the aim of establishing the relationship between the first intermediate mass black holes created in the universe and the super - massive black holes that power the emission of bright @xmath3 quasars .",
    "we show that almost no correlation is present between the sites of formation of the first few hundred @xmath93 halos and the most massive halos at @xmath94 when the simulation box has an edge of several hundred @xmath95 . here",
    "the popiii progenitors ( halos of mass @xmath96 ) of massive halos at @xmath97 formed from density peaks that are @xmath98 more common than that of the _ first _ popiii star in the ( 720 mpc / h)@xmath11 simulation box .",
    "these halos virialize around @xmath99 , to be compared with @xmath100 of the _ first _ popiii halo .",
    "this has important consequences .",
    "we show that , if bright quasars and supermassive black holes live in the most massive halos at @xmath101 , then their progenitors at the @xmath13 mass scale are well within the popiii era , regardless of the popiii termination mechanism . on the other hand ,",
    "if the @xmath102 relationship is already in place at @xmath3 , then bright quasars are not linked to the remnants of the very first intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) born in the universe , as their imbh progenitors form when already several thousands of popiii stars have been created within the typical volume that hosts a bright @xmath3 quasar .",
    "the imbh seeds planted by this very first popiii stars have sufficient time to grow up to @xmath103 \\cdot 10^{10 } m_{\\odot}$ ] by @xmath3 if we assume eddington accretion with radiative efficiency @xmath104 . instead , quenching of the bh accretion is required for the seeds of those popiii stars that will not end up in massive halos at @xmath3 , otherwise the number density of supermassive black holes would greatly exceed the observational constraints .",
    "one way to obtain growth consistent with the observations is to limit the accreted mass at a fraction @xmath86 of the total baryon halo mass .",
    "this gives a slope of the bh mass function @xmath105 in the bh mass range @xmath106 \\cdot 10^{10 } m_{\\odot}$ ] , which is within the @xmath92 uncertainty of the slope of the bright end of the @xmath3 quasar luminosity function ( @xmath107 ) measured by @xcite .",
    "another important point highlighted by this study is that rich clusters do not preferentially host the remnants of the first popiii stars .",
    "in fact the remnants of the first 100 pop - iii stars in our medium sized simulation box ( volume of @xmath108 ) end up at @xmath44 on halos that have a median mass of @xmath109 .",
    "this suggests caution in interpreting the results from studies that select a specific volume of the simulation box , like a rich cluster , and then progressively refine smaller and smaller regions with the aim of hunting for the first lights formed in the whole simulation ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . only by considering refinements over the complete volume of the box the rarity and the formation ranking of these progenitors can be correctly evaluated ."
