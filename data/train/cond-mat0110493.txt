    "first - principles understanding on the rich dynamic phenomena and the nature of the liquid - glass transition still remains as a challenging aim @xcite . as the only existing first - principle theory , the mode coupling theory ( mct ) of supercooled liquids and the glass transition enjoyed considerable success in describing the dynamics of weakly supercooled regime of liquids @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding this surprising success , there are the following several unresolved issues concerning the basis of mct : ( a ) a crucial ingredient of mct is the factorization approximation which replaces the four - body time correlation functions by the product of two - body time correlation functions .",
    "this approximation is completely uncontrolled and its region of validity is _ a priori _ unknown .",
    "( b ) the idealized mct predicts a sharp dynamic transition to a nonergodic state at a certain temperature .",
    "but mct does not provide any information on the nature of this nonergodic state .",
    "( c ) the physical picture of the so called hopping processes in an extended version of mct is still lacking .    in recent years",
    ", possible deep connection between the structural glass and a class of spin glass models has been pointed out @xcite .",
    "in particular , the langevin dynamics of the spherical @xmath0-spin model can be analyzed exactly in the thermodynamic limit due to the mean field nature of the model ( i.e. , full connectivity of the spins ) @xcite .",
    "this analysis shows that the dynamic equation for the spin correlation function in equilibrium for @xmath1 has the same form as in the leutheusser s schematic mode coupling equation for the density correlator @xcite .",
    "the sharp dynamic transition observed in this class of models are driven by the dissipative nonlinearity in the equation of motion which originates from the nonlinear hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this , the glassy behavior in the above - mentioned mct ( as well as in our model given below ) is driven by the _ reversible _",
    "nonlinearity @xcite which is dynamically generated and hence a non - trivial hamiltonian is not necessary .    with these situations , we thought that it is important to develop a toy model with following three ingredients :    * reversible mode coupling mechanism * trivial statics * mean - field type so that the model can be exactly solvable .",
    "we have proposed such a toy model in a recent publication @xcite . here",
    "we further analyze the model .",
    "the model yields the self - consistent equations for the relevant correlation functions of the type familiar in the mode coupling theories of supercooled liquid and glass transition , where the strength of the hopping processes can be readily tuned . in the sense that the glassy behavior in this toy model is induced by the kinetics of the reversible mode coupling mechanism , our model is similar in spirit to the kinetically constrained models , the theme of the present workshop",
    "our model is defined as the following langevin equations for the @xmath2-component density variable @xmath3 with @xmath4 and the @xmath5-component velocity variable @xmath6 with @xmath7 . here and after we will use roman indices for the component of @xmath8 and greek for that of @xmath9 .",

    "the thermal noise @xmath14 are independent gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance @xmath15 , @xmath16 being the temperature of the heat bath with which the system has a thermal contact .",
    "the choice of this variance guarantees the proper equilibration of the system .",
    "the @xmath17 matrix @xmath18 plays an important role in the model and for later purpose we impose the ( one - sided ) orthogonality k_ik_i= _ , k_ik_j_ij where the last equation is due to the inequality @xmath19 . for @xmath20",
    "we can impose an additional condition @xmath21 and hence trivially @xmath22 .",
    "we also note that @xmath18 governs linearized reversible dynamics of the model with the dynamical matrix @xmath23 given by @xmath24 .",
    "the reversible nonlinear mode coupling terms are the ones involving the mode coupling coefficients @xmath25 which are chosen to be quenched ( time - independent ) gaussian random variables with the following properties : ^j & = 0 , + ^j & = where @xmath26 denotes average over the @xmath27 s .",
    "note that there is no thermal noise which acts directly on the density variable in ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "this is because the model is constructed so as to mimic the dynamics of fluid .",
    "equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is analogous to the equation of continuity of fluid and eq.([eq2 ] ) is like the equation of motion where the right hand side is like the force acting on a fluid element . in constructing this model ,",
    "we were motivated by the works @xcite in which random coupling models involving an infinite component order parameter have been shown to be exactly analyzed by mean - field - type concepts .",
    "we will thus eventually take @xmath2 and @xmath5 infinite with the ratio @xmath28 kept finite .",
    "one can derive from the langevin equations ( 1)-(3 ) the corresponding fokker - planck equation for the probability distribution function @xmath29 for our variable set denoted as @xmath30 as follows _",

    "the functional determinant associated with the langevin equations ( [ eq1])-([eq3 ] ) which should appear in the integrand of the generating functional @xmath41 was equated to unity assuming the it calculus @xcite .",
    "the various correlation functions and response functions are obtained by taking various functional derivatives of @xmath42 with respect to @xmath35 s and @xmath36 s and setting them equal to zero in the end in the standard way , where @xmath43 is the generating functional @xmath41 , averaged over the @xmath44 s and the @xmath27 s .",

    "note that for the case @xmath20 , if @xmath21 is imposed , then @xmath50 .",
    "the corresponding response functions can be defined as since we have a gaussian stationary solution , we get the fluctuation - dissipation relationships ( fdr ) of the form @xcite where @xmath51 is the unit step function : @xmath52 for @xmath53 and @xmath54 otherwise . note that this form of the fdr is rather unusual since the fdr usually takes the form @xmath55 .",
    "another useful property arising from the causality and the above fdr is the following property = < x(t ) a ( t ) > = 0 t t for @xmath56 and an arbitrary function @xmath57 .",
    "we now take averages of @xmath41 over the thermal noise @xmath58 and the quenched random coupling @xmath25 . in",

    "now we have to deal with the interaction part @xmath61 .",
    "one can show that in the limit of @xmath62 fluctuations can be neglected so that quantities like @xmath63 etc .",
    "are replaced by @xmath64 , etc .",

    "we also note that the correlator @xmath72 is not involved in the @xmath67 s .    from the effective gaussian action @xmath73",

    "we multiply ( [ eq23 ] ) by @xmath83 and take thermal average .",
    "then we obtain c_a^k(t ) = c_ba(t ) -_aac_a^k(t)-_abc_ba(t ) similarly by multiplying ( [ eq23 ] ) and ( [ eq24 ] ) by @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively , and performing the thermal average we obtain the following equations for @xmath86 and @xmath87 c_ab(t ) & = c_b(t ) -_aac_ab(t)-_abc_b(t ) , + c_b(t ) & = -c_b(t)-^2 c_ab(t ) -_bac_ab(t)-_bbc_b(t ) the equations ( [ eq26])-([eq30 ] ) constitute the self - consistent equations for the 5 correlators @xmath88 , @xmath82 , @xmath81 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",

    "the first equality is due to the time translation invariance and the second one from the time reversal property of the velocity components .",
    "note that for @xmath97 the two correlators @xmath93 and @xmath94 become identical .",
    "similarly , from ( [ eq34])-([eq35 ] ) , we obtain c^l_ab(z)&= + c^l_b(z)&=    now let us look at the behavior of the correlators for different values of @xmath98 .",
    "for @xmath99 the only nonvanishing kernel is @xmath100 .",
    "hence we obtain c^l_a(z)&= , ^l_bb(z)= , + c^kl_a(z)&= , + c^l_b(z)&= , + c^l_ab(z)&=-c^l_ba(z)= here we point out that there appears to be a subtlety associated with the two limiting procesures : ( a ) first take @xmath101 before any calculation .",
    "( b ) first calculate with @xmath102 and then take the limit @xmath103 .",
    "the procesure ( a ) gives both @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that the @xmath106 variables are time - independent since there is no velocity variable @xmath107 that drives dynamics of @xmath106 .",
    "however the results ( [ eq42])-([eq45 ] ) were obtained by adopting the second limiting procedure ( b ) . here",
    "@xmath88 is trivially nonergodic : @xmath104 whereas and @xmath108 exhibits a nontrivial nonergodic behavior : @xmath109 .",
    "the difference between these two procedures can be seen also by looking at ( [ eq33 ] ) for @xmath94 .",
    "the terms except the first one on the right hand side is absent if the first limiting procedure ( a ) is adopted , whereas it remains finite in the second limiting procedure ( b ) .    for @xmath97",
    "where @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath110 reproduces the equation derived in @xcite , apart from the wave number dependence .",
    "note that if we put @xmath111 _ by hand _ , ( [ eq36 ] ) or ( [ eq37 ] ) gives a closed equation for @xmath88 alone .",
    "this equation is nothing but the leutheusser s schematic mc equation giving a dynamic transition from ergodic phase to nonergodic one .",
    "but in reality @xmath68 and @xmath69 can not be ignored and our numerical solution strongly indicates that the system remains ergodic for all temperatures due to the strong contribution of these so called hopping terms . furthermore these hopping terms do not become self - consistently small as temperature is lowered . therefore the density correlator does not show a continuous slowing down with lowering temperature .",
    "this result was striking to us since usually a mean - field - type theory , such as the dynamics of the spherical @xmath0-spin model in the limit of @xmath112 , often gives a sharp dynamic transition .",
    "in fact , we were first constructing the toy model with @xmath20 and we expected that the model designed to rigorously reproduce the idealized mct exhibits such a dynamic transition . but to our surprise",
    "the dynamic transition was absent in the @xmath2-component toy model .",
    "this aspect is a fundamental difference in the two kinds of mean - field - type theories with and without reversible mode coupling .",
    "the foremost example of the latter is the sherical @xmath0-spin model where the ergodic - to - nonergodic transition is driven by the dissipative nonlinearity which comes from the nonlinear random hamiltonian . as demonstrated below , in order to have such a sharp transition in our toy model , we find it necessary to extend the original @xmath2-component model to the model with @xmath19 .",
    "thus it is very difficult to understand the idealized mct _ without _ relying upon uncontrolled approximation .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the ergodicity restoring process in our toy model ( represented by the kernels @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) has nothing to do with a thermally activated energy barrier crossing since the gaussian hamiltonian in our model does not possess such a barrier .     the relaxation of the nonmalized density correlator @xmath113 for @xmath114 .",
    "the other parameters are given by @xmath115 .",
    "the curves are , from left to right at long times , for @xmath116 , and @xmath117,width=472,height=340 ]    our numerical solution for @xmath114 is shown in figure 1 with various values of @xmath16 .",
    "the other parameters were fixed as @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 .",
    "as @xmath16 is lowered , the relaxation exhibits a continuous slowing and it appears to be frozen at lowest @xmath16 .",
    "one may ask whether this freezing reflects the presence of the genuine nonergodicity or it is merely apparent : the decaying will be observed if the observation time window is further extended .",
    "the question of the existence of nonergodicity is easily answered in the usual idealized mct where one can easily solve the closed equation for the nonergodicity parameter to obtain the phase diagram .",
    "the situation is very different in our toy model . when we expand the correlators as @xmath121 etc .",
    ", we end up with a herarchically connected set of equations for all the @xmath44 s , which can not be easily analyzed numerically .",
    "an analytic feature signifying the presence of the genuine nonergodic state can be seen by adiabatically eliminating the velocity components in the limit of large @xmath10 and obtaining the fokker - planck equation for the distribution function @xmath122 containing only the @xmath106 variables : = here the diffusion matrix @xmath123 is given by q_ij(\\{a } ) m_i m_j + m_i k_i+ j_ika_k an important point is that the diffusion matrix @xmath124 is _ singular _ for @xmath19 , i.e. , det@xmath125 @xcite .",
    "the proof is simple .",
    "define a @xmath126 matrix @xmath127 by @xmath128 for @xmath129 , @xmath130 for @xmath131 .",
    "then we obtain in matrix notation @xmath132 ( the superscript @xmath16 denotes the transposed matrix ) . then",
    "det@xmath133(det@xmath134 since det@xmath135 by construction .",
    "this implies that the fokker - planck equation ( [ eq47 ] ) can have _ nonequilibrium _ stationary solution other than the equilibrium one , @xmath136 .",
    "this nonequilibrium stationary solutions are precisely the kind of nonergodic states found numerically in the present toy model .",
    "the general stationary solution @xcite is given by d_l(\\{a})=f(_j a_j)^-a_i^2 where @xmath137 is the eigenvector of the diffusion matrix @xmath124 with zero eigenvalue . if the function @xmath138 is a constant , then @xmath139 is the equilibrium distribution , otherwise it is a nonequilibrium stationary distribution .",
    "one instructive case for the nonequilibrium stationary solutions is that of @xmath140 . for this case",
    ", @xmath124 becomes proportional to the dynamic matrix @xmath141 : @xmath142 . by the same argument as above @xmath141 is singular as well .",
    "note from ( [ eq36 ] ) that @xmath143 in the limit of @xmath144 .",
    "the other correlators do not diverge at @xmath145 .",
    "hence the model is nonergodic for @xmath146 : the system is always driven into the nonergodic state in the linear case ( @xmath140 ) . in this case",
    "the thermal noise alone is not enough to drive the system to the equilibrium state .",
    "this case is somewhat reminiscent of the ideal gas case or the collection of independent harmonic oscillators where the systems are trivially non - ergodic due to the absence of interactions .",
    "only when the nonlinear reversible mode coupling is present , as @xmath16 increases , the thermal noise can drive the system to the equilbrium state , hence making the system ergodic .",
    "the onset temperature at which the ergodicity is recovered is the dynamic transition temperature .    in any event",
    ", further numerical and theoretical studies of possibile ergodic - to - nonergodic transitions for nontrivial case @xmath147 are warranted .",
    "we have constructed a dynamic mean - field - type model involving @xmath2-component density and @xmath5-component velocity variables with reversible mode coupling and trivial hamiltonian .",
    "the model is exactly solvable in the limit of @xmath148 with keeping the ratio @xmath28 finite .",
    "the model exhibits a sharp dynamic transition to a nonergodic state only in the range @xmath149 .",
    "the nature of the nonergodic state can be understood in terms of the nonequilibrium stationary solution of the fokker - planck equation for the probability distribution for the density variable .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the nonequilibrium aging behavior of the model .",
