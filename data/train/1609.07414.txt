    "in the recent past , the flow of granular materials has been the subject of many scientific works ; this is due to the large number of natural phenomena ( i.e. , landslides and debris flows ) and industrial processes involving solid particles flowing .",
    "granular materials can behave very differently depending on both the micro - mechanical properties of the particles and the macroscopic characteristic of the system ( i.e. , geometry , gradients of velocity , density ) .",
    "in particular , granular systems , as well as other soft matter such as suspensions of soft particles or polymers , foams , or emulsions , can behave like fluids , meaning that they yield under shear stress , or like solids able to resist applied stresses without deforming.@xcite granular materials exhibit solid - like behavior if the particles are packed densely enough and a network of persistent contacts develops within the medium , resulting in a jammed mechanically stable structure of the particles . on the other hand , when the grains are widely spaced and free to move in any direction , interacting only through collisions , the medium is unjammed and behaves like a fluid .",
    "+ as a consequence , a key question concerns how to model the transition from fluid- to solid - like behavior and vice - versa ?",
    "this transition is reflected in the relation between stresses and deformation rates , that is the rheology .",
    "jammed structures can show a rate independent behavior , but in unjammed granular systems the stresses are proportional to the square of the strain rate ( bagnold scaling@xcite ) . in the proximity of jamming ,",
    "a continuous transition between the two extreme regimes takes place , for which the correct rheology is still not fully understood.@xcite + numerical simulations performed by using perfectly rigid spheres ( i.e. , infinite stiffness)@xcite have shown that pressure , shear stress and granular temperature ( defined as the mean squared velocity fluctuations , representing a measure of the degree of agitation of the system ) diverge when the density approaches jamming , as predicted by the kinetic theory of granular gases.@xcite as a consequence , jammed flows of rigid particles are not possible at constant volume .",
    "in contrast , numerical results with soft particles@xcite show that steady , constant volume flows are possible also at densities above jamming .",
    "their softness allows the particles to deform and to attain steady shear at very dense , jammed configurations .",
    "experiments performed on concentrated suspension @xcite of hard and rigid particles have revealed different physical processes in the straining and the flow behavior of hard and soft spheres suspension , in particular in the unsteady regime , due to the development of permanent contacts of the particles in the case of deformable spheres at large volume fractions .",
    "+ although several constitutive models have been proposed in the literature to account for the softness of the particles,@xcite most of them have some important limitations . in particular , most of them `` match '' the limits of fluid- and solid - like behavior and many do not provide continuous and differentiable equations for all the variables of the system ( i.e. , pressure , shear stress and granular temperature ) .",
    "many models are not able to quantitatively predict steady shear flows at all densities .",
    "+ for a collection of particles , the jamming transition occurs in the limit of zero confining pressure at the critical volume fraction @xmath2 ( where , for a granular material composed of identical particles , the local volume fraction @xmath3 is defined as the ratio of the local material density to the particle density , and the subscript @xmath4 refers to the jamming transition ) .",
    "recently , several authors have shown that , under homogeneous steady shearing , stresses and granular temperature can be expressed as asymptotic power - law relations of the shear strain , if scaled by powers of @xmath5 , the distance to jamming.@xcite however , different authors report different critical exponents in the solid ( jammed ) and fluid ( unjammed ) regimes , both numerically@xcite and theoretically.@xcite the critical exponents , as well as the jamming volume fraction , are affected by several parameters : the polydispersity of the system , @xcite the friction of the particles , the force contact model adopted in the simulations ( linear spring or hertzian ) and the ratios of relevant time - scales like the inverse shear rate or square root of the particle stiffness per mass .",
    "even though the jamming density is known to be pressure- , and material- as well as protocol - dependent , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein , for the purpose of scaling we have to work with a constant @xmath2 .",
    "jamming transition and scaling of quantities with respect to the distance from jamming are also very popular subjects in the fluid - dynamics and statistical - mechanics community . in particular , complex fluids composed of a dispersion of one material in a continuous phase show a transition from mechanically solid - like to fluid - like states , similarly to granular systems , when the shear stress is increased above some critical value , the yield stress.@xcite emulsions , colloids , foams , gels and suspensions of ( soft ) particles or polymers belong to this category . by performing experiments on different kinds of yield - stress fluids ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite have found that , by appropriate scaling with the distance to jamming , such kind of complex fluid systems allowed a data collapse onto universal power - law relations of the shear strain , in the fluid - like and solid - like regimes .",
    "the presence of the `` continuum phase '' , i.e. the liquid in which droplets or particles are dispersed , leads to critical exponents for the case of complex fluids which differ from those of dry collections of soft particles , especially in the fluid - like state , but the intrinsic rheology is actually surprisingly analogous . +",
    "this work focuses on the simple shear flow of an ideal granular material , composed of identical , frictionless spheres , under steady conditions , at constant volume .",
    "a series of discrete element method simulations are performed in order to investigate the role of particle stiffness in a wide range of volume fractions , both well below and above jamming .",
    "the goal is to propose phenomenological constitutive relations for granular materials merging dilute and dense flow conditions .",
    "first , we analyze our numerical results to derive appropriate scaling laws in both unjammed and jammed states , far from the jamming transition ( with special functional forms that are needed further on ) . then , we use the scaling laws that collapse the data in either solid or fluid regimes to postulate a phenomenological model for the stresses and the granular temperature . in particular , the two regimes are merged in a unique function which is ( i ) continuous and differentiable at any point and ( ii ) able to predict the behavior even close to the jamming transition . + this paper",
    "is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the simulation method and the flow configuration ; in section 3 the difference between rigid and soft particles granular systems are discussed in terms of the @xmath6 rheology@xcite and the jamming density is evaluated based on the behavior of the coordination number as function of volume fraction and particles stiffness .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the scaling relations obtained from the numerical data ; in section 5 the merged constitutive model is presented and compared with numerical results ; in section 6 we discuss the comparison of the proposed model with the rheologies proposed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; in particular , the model in ref .",
    "@xcite was proposed for emulsion - type systems , and is here revised to adapt to the case of dry assemblies of soft spheres , according to our numerical data .",
    "finally , the results are summarized and concluding remarks are given in section 7 .",

    "the other variables governing the problem are the volume fraction @xmath3 ( or density , or concentration , defined as the fraction of volume occupied by the spheres ) , the pressure @xmath9 , the shear stress @xmath10 and the granular temperature @xmath11 .",
    "the latter is defined as one third of the mean squared particle velocity fluctuations and represents a measure of the degree of agitation of the system , as introduced in the framework of kinetic theories of granular gases .",
    "@xcite + we have performed dem numerical simulations of steady simple shear flow of frictionless spheres to investigate the role of the particle stiffness @xmath12 , especially at large volume fraction .",
    "the simulations and the coarse - graining presented in this paper , were undertaken using the open - source code mercury - dpm ( www.mercurydpm.org).@xcite the simulations are done under constant volume with a uniform shear in a rectangular box of dimensions @xmath13 , respectively in @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 directions ( fig .",

    "the shear is applied using lees - edwards@xcite periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath16 direction and periodic boundary conditions are employed in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 directions . in all simulations ,",
    "we use 2000 particles of diameter @xmath17 , density @xmath18 , i.e. , mass @xmath19 , and fix the height of the computational domain as @xmath20 , before we compute the @xmath21 and @xmath22 size @xmath23 accordingly to the chosen volume fraction @xmath3 . the system is sheared applying a constant velocity gradient ( shear rate ) @xmath24 with mean flow @xmath25 in the @xmath14 direction only .",

    "simulations have been performed by systematically changing both the volume fraction @xmath3 , ranging from 0.2 to 0.68 , and the particle stiffness @xmath12 , such that the dimensionless quantity @xmath35 ranges from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "+ at large volume fraction ( i.e. , @xmath38 ) and large particle stiffness ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) , we observed crystallization of the monodisperse systems , which results in non - homogeneous flows such as shear bands . to avoid crystalline structures , in such situations we use slightly polydisperse systems , with mean particle diameter @xmath17 and uniform polydispersity @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the ratio of the maximum to the minimum particle diameter",
    "such a small value of the polydispersity does not affect significantly the measured quantities , and , in particular , does not vary so much the critical volume fraction.@xcite + here and in the following , we use standard notation to refer to dimensional variables , whereas the star is adopted to denote quantities scaled using the particle diameter @xmath17 , density @xmath18 and stiffness @xmath12 .",
    "then , the scaled granular temperature , pressure , shear stress and shear rate are given , respectively , as : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we also introduce three time scales : the microscopic relaxation time scale associated with the transversal motion of a particle submitted to a pressure @xmath9 : @xmath46 ; the macroscopic time scale associated with the shear rate parallel to the flow : @xmath47 ; and the time scale associated with the particles deformability ( contact duration ) : @xmath48 .",
    "a convincing yet simple phenomenological model , which has been used frequently in the literature in the last years , is the @xmath6 rheology.@xcite according to this model , only three dimensionless variables are relevant for steady shear flows of granular materials : the volume fraction @xmath3 , the stress ratio @xmath49 and the inertial number @xmath0 .",
    "the inertial number represents the ratio between the microscopic relaxation and the macroscopic shear time scales : @xmath50 . on the planes @xmath51 and @xmath6 , data obtained on different flow configurations collapse in the limit of rigid particles.@xcite two main assumptions at the basis of the @xmath6 rheology are : ( i ) perfectly rigid particles and ( ii ) homogeneous flow ( local rheology ) . under these two assumption ,",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath53 are the only time scales influencing the problem .",
    "when the particles are soft ( ` softness ' effect@xcite ) and/or the flow is not homogeneous ( ` non - local ' effects@xcite ) , the standard @xmath6 laws fail because different mechanisms come into play . + in the case of non - homogeneous flows",
    ", boundaries affect the system and flow gradients can not be neglected anymore . in such situations ,",
    "@xcite have proposed a new `` diffusive '' state parameter , the granular fluidity , with a diffusive evolution equation , to account for some non - locality ( see also ref .",
    "+ on the other hand , when the particles are not perfectly rigid , contacts are not instantaneous but take a finite time @xmath54 during which a part of the energy , the elastic potential energy fraction , is stored@xcite due to the persistent deformations of the particles . +",
    "when a steady flow is unjammed and sheared very slowly , rigid and deformable particles exhibit very similar behavior , controlled only by @xmath52 and @xmath53 , because @xmath54 is much smaller than either ; when the transition to the solid , jammed phase takes place ( and this happens only to soft spheres ) , the time scale associate to the particles deformability @xmath54 ( contact duration ) starts to influence the system , and softness effects appear . in this work ,",
    "we investigate homogeneous steady shear flow of soft particles , but still can disregard non - local effects .",

    "+        as predicted by the @xmath6 rheology , in the case of infinitely hard particles , for vanishing @xmath0 , the stress ratio tends to a constant , asymptotic value , often interpreted as the yield stress ratio . at the same time , the volume fraction saturates to the rigid - limit jamming value ( here @xmath59 as detailed in the following ) . in the case of deformable particles ,",
    "the data deviate from the rigid limit curves and behave very differently depending on the softness . data with large stiffness agree with the rigid limit data in a large range of inertial numbers and deviate for very slow shear conditions ( i.e. , very low @xmath0 due to either small @xmath8 and/or large @xmath9 ) . for decreasing @xmath0 and constant stiffness , on the @xmath6 plane , fig .",
