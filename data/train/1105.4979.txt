    ", testing general relativity at the largest possible scales is essential . for man - made instruments ,",

    "the outcome was a signal now known as the pioneer anomaly @xcite .",
    "the long term variations of this signal may be explained as an anisotropic thermal effect @xcite but periodic anomalies have also been identified @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the _ roadmap for fundamental physics in space _ issued by esa in 2010 @xcite stresses the importance of testing gravitation at large scales with missions to the outer planets . to do so",
    ", it recommends the development of accelerometers compatible with spacecraft tracking at the 10 pm s@xmath0 level .",
    "several missions have already been proposed @xcite with the aim of improving the knowledge of the gravitational field in the solar system .",

    "it will be assumed in this article that these additional terms either are negligible or can be corrected , such that the external signal will be referred to as the spacecraft non - gravitational acceleration @xcite .",

    "the constraints in the integration of the instrument in the spacecraft with the aim of preserving these performances requires additional work .",

    "the gravity advanced package is made of an electrostatic accelerometer , called microstar , which can be rotated with the bias rejection system .",

    "a control loop adjusts the potentials of the electrodes in order to keep the proof mass at the center of the cage .",
    "the numerical values of these potentials , which are the outputs of the instrument , are proportional to the components of the acceleration of the proof mass with respect to the cage on each axis of the accelerometer .    the bias rejection system is a rotating platform composed of a rotating actuator and a high resolution angular encoder working in closed loop operation .",

    "finally , even if piezo - electric motors have a non - zero torque in the power - off mode , a blocking system will be implemented to prevent unwanted motion during launch and maneuvers .",

    "this method is similar to the optimal filtering technique @xcite : the first one is expressed in the time domain whereas the second one is express in the frequency domain .",
    "it is possible to express the components of the inverse of the covariance matrix @xmath189 using the power spectrum density of the noise instead of its covariance matrix : if @xmath190 and @xmath191 are two column vectors , then @xmath192    one may process the data form the accelerometer using the generalized least square method .",

    "[ fig : auto_dem_a ] is nearly the same as the one obtained with the gls approach : the autocorrelation function obtained with the gls approach is similar to the one of a gaussian noise and its value for @xmath196 is @xmath197  m@xmath2  s@xmath3 instead of @xmath198  m@xmath2  s@xmath3 for fig .

    "but since their value impact the uncertainty on the demodulated accelerations , it is legitimate to choose these values such that the uncertainty is minimized .",
    "figure [ fig : uncertainty_optimization ] shows the uncertainty on the demodulated acceleration for an integration time of one hour and for the ls ( a ) and gls ( b ) methods .",

    "this data processing was the topic of this article .",
    "the first result obtained was conditions under which the bias is completely removed from the signal of interest .",
    "these conditions allowed designing calibration signals , i.e. a time - pattern for the rejection angle .",
    "then the uncertainties on the unbiased non - gravitational acceleration were computed .",
    "it was shown that it is possible to recover the mean acceleration over each period of modulation and to have access to sinusoidal variations of this accelerations with some restriction on the pulsation of the signal .",
    "finally , a method was presented to optimize the modulation period and the masking time so as to reach the minimum uncertainty .",
    "it has been shown that several parameters influence the precision on the post - processed quantities : the modulation time , the masking time and the integration time .",
    "it is possible to choose a set of parameters , which are technologically speaking reasonable , leading to precision below 1  pm  s@xmath0 on mean quantities as well as on the amplitude of sinusoidal variations .",
