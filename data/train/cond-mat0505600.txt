    "the observation of an oscillating josephson current across an one - dimensional array of potential wells , usually generated by a standing - wave laser field and commonly known as an optical - lattice potential , in a trapped cigar - shaped bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) by cataliotti _",

    "they investigated the evolution of the josephson frequency with the strength of the optical - lattice potential and found that , for a fixed laser wave length , the josephson frequency reduces with the increase of the strength .",

    "we address several interesting features of josephson oscillation in a trapped bec as in the experiment of cataliotti _ et al .",
    "how does the josephson frequency evolve with the number of atoms and atomic interaction ( attractive or repulsive ) of the condensate ?",
    "how does the josephson frequency depend on the intensity ( strength ) and wave length of the standing - wave laser beam used to create the periodic optical - lattice potential ?",
    "what are the limits on the optical - lattice potential parameters for allowing a josephson oscillation ?",
    "is it possible to have a collapse in an attractive bec induced by a josephson oscillation ?    in the actual experiment @xcite and a previous three - dimensional simulation @xcite the extraction of josephson frequency was rather indirect .",
    "the bec in the optical - lattice potential was allowed to expand and form an interference pattern of two bright pieces moving in opposite directions from a central piece after a certain interval of time .",
    "the position of the original bec executing a josephson oscillation in the periodic optical - lattice potential was predicted from the position of the observed interference pattern . in this indirect fashion",
    "the josephson oscillation was identified and its frequency extracted .",
    "although , because of the very small size of the bec , this seems to be the only means for experimental observation , we employ a direct approach for the study of josephson oscillation in the present numerical simulation , which is more accurate and easier to implement than the indirect approach employed in refs . @xcite . in present simulation",

    "there has also been a study of induced collapse of an attractive bec trapped by a system of laser beams in the presence of small fluctuations of the laser intensity @xcite . in this paper , to the best of our knowledge , we study for the first time the possibility of collapse of an attractive bec induced by josephson oscillation . in view of the routine experiments",

    "<S> using the axially - symmetric time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation we study the josephson oscillation of an attractive bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a one - dimensional periodic optical - lattice potential . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the josephson frequency is virtually independent of the number of atoms in the bec and of the inter - atomic interaction ( attractive or repulsive ) . </S>",
    "<S> we study the dependence of josephson frequency on the laser wave length and the strength of the optical - lattice potential . for a fixed laser wave length ( 795 nm ) </S>",
    "<S> , the josephson frequency decreases with increasing strength as found in the experiment of cataliotti _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ [ science * 293 * , 843 ( 2001 ) ] . for a fixed strength , </S>",
    "<S> the josephson frequency remains essentially unchanged for a reasonable variation of laser wave length around 800 nm . </S>",
    "<S> however , the josephson oscillation is disrupted with the increase of laser wave length beyond 2000 nm leading to a collapse of a sufficiently attractive bec . </S>",
    "<S> these features of josephson oscillation can be tested experimentally with present set ups . </S>"
