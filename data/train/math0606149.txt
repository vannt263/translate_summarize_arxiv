    ". furthermore , as @xmath4 is a plane lattice , this set contains no accumulation points , and is thus finite .",
    "let @xmath117 be such that there is exactly one point @xmath53 of the arc of @xmath51 from @xmath118 to @xmath119 that lies on an edge of @xmath4 , and suppose that @xmath53 lies in the interior of this arc .",
    "let @xmath120 be the event that @xmath4 contains an infinite open path leaving @xmath51 at the point @xmath53 .",
    "then @xmath121 , and @xmath122 .",
    "the events @xmath123 and @xmath124 are decreasing .",
    "thus , from harris s lemma , @xmath125 if the unique edge of @xmath4 on which @xmath53 lies is closed , then @xmath124 holds , so @xmath126 . since @xmath127 , we thus have @xmath128 similarly , since @xmath122 , we have @xmath129    as @xmath104 is increased from @xmath15 to @xmath33 , the probability of @xmath130 decreases , while the probability of @xmath131 increases .",
    "these probabilities change only at a finite set of jumps , corresponding to boundary points of @xmath51 on edges of @xmath4 , and we have just shown ( in and ) that , at each jump , @xmath132 increases by at most a factor of @xmath133 , and @xmath134 decreases by at most this factor . when @xmath135 the arc @xmath74 is empty ,",
    "so @xmath136 , while for @xmath137 the arc @xmath75 is empty and the inequality is reversed .",
    "increasing @xmath104 gradually from @xmath15 until @xmath132 first exceeds @xmath134 , it follows that there is some @xmath138 for which @xmath139 from now on we fix such a @xmath104 , and write @xmath59 for @xmath140 , and so on .    inequalities and imply @xmath141 and @xmath142 since @xmath143 by symmetry , it follows that for every @xmath66 we have @xmath144 where the final inequality is from . in other words , @xmath145 for every @xmath66 .",
    "from , there is _ some _",
    "@xmath146 for which @xmath147 . by symmetry , @xmath148 .",
    "let @xmath149 .",
    "then @xmath150 is the intersection of four events each of which has probability at least @xmath151 , so @xmath152 .    to complete the proof of theorem  [ th1 ]",
    ", we shall invoke the uniqueness result of aizenman , kesten and newman  @xcite mentioned in the introduction .",
    "this result states that , if @xmath153 is a connected @xmath154-dimensional lattice , and each edge @xmath38 of @xmath153 is open with probability @xmath155 independently of the other edges , then , provided the edge probabilities @xmath156 are preserved by translations of the lattice into itself , the probability that there are two or more infinite open clusters is zero .",
    "these assumptions apply both to @xmath4 and to @xmath36 , so , with probability @xmath3 , neither @xmath4 nor @xmath36 contains two infinite open clusters .",
    "thus , with positive probability , @xmath150 holds and the infinite open paths @xmath157 , @xmath158 in @xmath4 leaving @xmath51 from @xmath159 and @xmath160 are joined by a finite open path @xmath49 in @xmath4 , while the infinite open paths @xmath161 , @xmath162 in @xmath36 leaving @xmath51 from @xmath163 and @xmath164 are joined by a finite open path @xmath165 in @xmath36 . since open paths in @xmath4 and in @xmath36 can not cross , this is a topological impossibility .",
    "this contradiction completes the proof .",
    "in this section we give a corollary of theorem  [ th1 ] , and also some extensions . in all these , the reduced symmetry requirement of theorem  [ th1 ] itself is the only new ingredient , so we shall only outline the arguments .",
    "menshikov  @xcite proved ( essentially ) that if @xmath4 is a lattice , and we take the bonds of @xmath4 to be open independently with probability @xmath166 , then as the graph distance between two vertices of @xmath4 increases , the probability that they are joined by an open path decreases exponentially .",
    "( this also follows from an independent result of aizenman and barsky  @xcite ; see  @xcite or  @xcite . )",
    "a well known consequence of this result is that if @xmath4 is a plane lattice and @xmath36 is its dual , then @xmath167 .",
    "( see  @xcite , for example . )",
    "theorem  [ th1 ] implies that @xmath168 , so we obtain the following corollary .",
    "theorem  [ th1 ] and corollary  [ c1 ] have natural equivalents for site percolation . in",
    "_ independent site percolation _ on a graph @xmath4 , we take each vertex of @xmath4 to be open with probability @xmath6 , independently of the other vertices .",
    "open paths and clusters are then paths and components in the subgraph of @xmath4 induced by the open vertices , and the definitions of the percolation probability @xmath171 and critical probability @xmath172 are analogous to those of @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "there is a well known ` matching ' relation between certain pairs of graphs that plays a role for site percolation corresponding to plane duality for bond percolation , used by kesten  @xcite , for example , but going back much earlier . a plane lattice @xmath4 matches the ( not necessarily planar ) graph @xmath175 obtained from @xmath4 by adding an edge @xmath176 for every pair of non - adjacent vertices @xmath53 , @xmath177 of @xmath4 lying in a common face of @xmath4 .",
    "the relevant properties of @xmath175 are that finite open clusters in @xmath4 or @xmath175 are surrounded by closed cycles in @xmath175 or @xmath4 , respectively , and that an open path in @xmath4 can not cross a closed path in @xmath175 .",
    "apart from the minor irritation that all references to open paths or clusters in the dual graph ( now @xmath175 rather than @xmath36 ) should be changed to closed paths or clusters , the proofs of theorem  [ th1 ] and corollary  [ c1 ] carry over almost verbatim to the site percolation setting , to give the following result .      just like zhang s original argument",
    ", the proof of theorems  [ th1 ] and  [ th2 ] carries over to weighted graphs , in which edges are open independently but different edges have different weights , or probabilities of being open .",
    "of course , these probabilities should respect the lattice structure . for a formal statement and proof see ( * ? ? ? * section 5.4 ) . in this way one can obtain a simple proof of a result of grimmett  @xcite ( stated , but not proved , by kesten  @xcite ) giving the ` critical surfaces ' for the weighted triangular and hexagonal lattices , in which the weight of an edge depends on its orientation ; see @xcite .    like zhang s argument , the proof of theorem  [ th1 ] ( which , after all , is just a simple modification of zhang s argument ) can be applied in contexts other than ordinary percolation . in particular , because the proof relies only on the uniqueness of the infinite cluster , positive correlation of increasing events , and the probability of a single edge being open being bounded away from @xmath3 , it also applies to the random cluster model of fortuin and kasteleyn  @xcite .",
    "indeed , welsh  @xcite showed that zhang s argument can be used to prove that the critical probability @xmath182 for the random cluster model on the square lattice satisfies @xmath183 for all @xmath184 ( see also grimmett  @xcite ) ; as far as we are aware , this is the only known proof of this result .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ th1 ] extends this result to the random cluster model on any self - dual plane lattice with @xmath32-fold symmetry .",
    "more generally , it shows that percolation can not occur simultaneously in two ` dual ' random cluster measures with @xmath32-fold symmetry .",

    "also , let @xmath191 denote the probability that the origin is in an infinite open cluster in this measure .",

    "<S> zhang found a simple , elegant argument deducing the non - existence of an infinite open cluster in certain lattice percolation models ( for example , @xmath0 bond percolation on the square lattice ) from general results on the uniqueness of an infinite open cluster when it exists ; this argument requires some symmetry . here </S>",

    "<S> zhang s argument , our extension applies in many contexts ; in particular , it enables us to answer a question of grimmett concerning the anisotropic random cluster model on the triangular lattice . </S>"
