    "tw hya is a nearby ( @xmath1 pc ) , young ( @xmath2 myr ) star @xcite surrounded by an accretion disk that evinces a large inner hole as judged from the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and mid - ir and sub - mm imaging @xcite .",
    "these data can be modeled with an optically thick disk whose inner edge is located @xmath3 au from the central star . while observations of 10 @xmath4 m silicate emission @xcite together with spatially - resolved emission at 2 @xmath4 m @xcite suggest the presence of dust grains with sizes less than a few microns at stellocentric distances @xmath5 au , this inner disk material appears optically thin , and has been estimated to constitute less than a lunar mass @xcite .",
    "such a small amount of material is compatible with the very low near - ir veiling measured previously @xcite .",
    "warm gas has also been detected within the optically thin inner region of tw hya s circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "in fact , the gas appears to be distributed in a disk with a similar inclination to the optically thick dust disk observed at larger radii ( @xmath67@xmath7 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . the inner disk of tw hya , while optically thin , is clearly not completely devoid of matter .    a variety of accretion signatures",
    "have been detected in tw hya , indicating some flow of gaseous material through the inner disk .",
    "observations of h@xmath8 emission , interpreted in the context of a magnetospheric accretion model , indicated @xmath9 m@xmath10 yr@xmath11 @xcite . a shock model fitted to uv and optical photometry indicated a consistent value of @xmath12 m@xmath10 yr@xmath11 @xcite . a similar model fitted to a separate uv spectrophotometric dataset yielded @xmath13 m@xmath10 yr@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "analysis of two additional epochs of uv data separated by approximately two years indicate an accretion rate of @xmath14 m@xmath10 yr@xmath11 on both occasions @xcite .",
    "still higher accretion rates were suggested by modeling of x - ray emission from tw hya : @xmath15 m@xmath10 yr@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a subsequent study of x - ray emission derived an accretion rate of @xmath16 m@xmath10 yr@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "modeling of the c@xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 line flux yields @xmath20 m@xmath10 yr@xmath11 @xcite",
    ".    while the large dispersion in accretion rate measurements is due in large part to different systematic effects for different techniques , in some cases the same technique used on different epochs ( generally by different investigators ) has yielded different accretion rates . moreover , a study of na d line variability suggested accretion rates varying between @xmath21 and @xmath22 m@xmath10 yr@xmath11 over a 1-yr period @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems that the amount of material in the inner disk may fluctuate significantly over time .    in this paper , we present observations of br@xmath0 emission and near - ir veiling .",
    "the two epochs of data show significant variations in br@xmath0 emission strength , but not in veiling .",
    "we use these findings to examine the viability to different mechanisms proposed to maintain the optically thin inner region of tw hya s disk .",
    "we observed tw hya on ut 17 january 2009 and ut 8 may 2009 with the aries instrument at the mmt .",
    "aries receives a corrected beam from the adaptive secondary of the mmt , and performs imaging and spectroscopy from 1 to 5 @xmath4 m wavelengths ( although the 35 @xmath4 m detector is not yet implemented ) .",
    "we used the echelle mode of aries , with a resolving power of @xmath23 .",
    "the slit is @xmath24 , well - matched to the diffraction - limited , ao - corrected resolution of the mmt .",
    "the small slit allows many orders to be placed on the detector simultaneously , and our setup included @xmath25 non - contiguous orders across the @xmath26 and @xmath27 bands .",
    "based on the echelle dispersion , we expect a velocity resolution of approximately 10 km s@xmath11 .",
    "measured fwhms of argon lamp lines show that the actual instrumental velocity resolution of these observations is approximately 14 km s@xmath11 .",
    "tw hya was observed for 10 minutes on 17 january 2009 and for 40 minutes on 8 may 2009 ( both of these are on - source integration times ) . in each epoch , observations of tw hya were interleaved with observations , at similar airmass , of an a1v telluric calibrator star , hip 54682 .",
    "the data were flat - fielded using spectra of an incandescent lamp , and extracted , wavelength calibrated , and telluric corrected , using iraf packages @xcite .",
    "wavelength calibration used telluric absorption lines and the hitran linelist @xcite , and is accurate to 12 km s@xmath11 .",
    "we also obtained imaging data of tw hya and the nearby star twa 7 during both epochs .",
    "twa 7 is a weak - line t tauri star @xcite of similar age to tw hya @xcite .",
    "it exhibits no detectable emission above the stellar photosphere in the near - ir , although it does have long - wavelength excess emission indicative of a debris disk @xcite . due to the low declinations of both tw hya and twa 7 , we did not have time to obtain spectra of twa 7 .",
    "however , since both sources were observed at similar airmasses and have similar colors , twa 7 can be used for relative photometric calibration . in january , 2009 , both objects were observed using the @xmath28 filter with integration times of 0.9 s. in may , 2009 , the atmospheric transparency was better , and these objects saturated the detector when the @xmath28 filter was used , even for the shortest integration times .",
    "we therefore observed tw hya and twa 7 with a narrowband h@xmath29 filter , using 5 s integrations , during the may observations .    during our may observations",
    ", we also obtained spectra of gj 568 a , an m3 v star @xcite .",
    "the total integration time was 25 minutes .",
    "the spectra were calibrated using the same procedure described above for tw hya .",
    "we use gj 568 below for a rough comparison of the veiling observed in tw hya with that of an unveiled main - sequence star .",
    "for each observed epoch , we computed the counts for both tw hya and twa 7 within an aperture of 40-pixel ( @xmath30 ) radius .",
    "the sky value was determined as the median of pixels with radii between 60 and 80 ; this value was subtracted from each pixel in the photometric aperture . assuming the 2mass magnitude of twa 7 , @xmath31",
    ", we derive the @xmath27 magnitude of tw hya at both epochs ( table [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "the two measurements are consistent with each other , and with the 2mass magnitude , @xmath32 .",
    "our br@xmath0 spectra are shown in figure [ fig : brg ] .",
    "we measure equivalent widths ( ews ) from these spectra by integrating the line flux between 2.1644 and 2.1668 @xmath4 m ; this range covers all of the br@xmath0 emission seen in both epochs .",
    "the main uncertainty in our ew determination is the continuum level .",
    "we estimate this uncertainty by fitting the continuum in different spectral regions .",
    "we find 12% error bars for our ew measurements .",
    "the lines measured in both epochs are blue - shifted . in the january data , the blue - shift is more pronounced , and a `` blue shoulder '' is more prominent in the spectrum .",
    "blue - shifts and blue - shoulder - profiles are expected for models of infalling gas , since absorption of br@xmath0 emission by the infalling gas along the line of sight preferentially removes red emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the emission in both epochs is substantially broader and more asymmetric than expected from stellar flares , which typically show strong ( h@xmath8 line - to - continuum ratios @xmath33 ) , narrow ( fwhm @xmath34 km s@xmath11 ) , symmetric emission line cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , quiescent chromospheric activity produces emission that is narrower and more symmetric than emission produced by accretion processes @xcite . since the difference spectrum for the two epochs is broad and asymmetric  lacking a strong , narrow core ",
    "the change between spectra is probably not due to chromospheric activity .    using the broad - band magnitude of tw hya derived in ",
    "[ sec : phot ] , we can convert the observed br@xmath0 ews into line luminosities .",
    "these , in turn , can be converted into accretion luminosities using an empirical relationship derived by @xcite . to convert the accretion luminosities into mass accretion rates requires knowledge of the stellar parameters : @xmath35 . for this calculation",
    ", we use the stellar parameters derived by @xcite , assuming a distance of 56 pc : @xmath36 m@xmath10 , @xmath37 r@xmath10 , and @xmath38 k. these are the same values used by @xcite , enabling a fair comparison with their results .",
    "derived line luminosities , accretion luminosities , and accretion rates are listed in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "we estimate continuum veiling in the @xmath27-band using mg and al lines near 2.11 @xmath4 m .",
    "these lines are found in a spectral region relatively free of telluric lines ( unlike , for instance , the co ro - vibrational bandheads ) , and have been used in past studies for veiling measurements of young stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the basic method we use to estimate veiling is to compare the observed spectrum to a synthetic spectrum for a stellar photospheric model .",
    "we first determine oscillator strengths for the mg and al transitions by comparing synthetic nextgen spectra for a solar - type star to observed solar spectra .",
    "synthetic spectra relevant for tw hya are then computed using stellar parameters determined from previous high dispersion optical spectroscopy @xcite : @xmath39 k , @xmath40 , [ m / h]@xmath41 , and @xmath42 km s@xmath11",
    ". the previously derived value of @xmath43 is smaller than the velocity resolution of our data .",
    "we rotationally broaden the synthetic spectra by @xmath44 km s@xmath11 , which is the convolution of the true @xmath45 ( @xmath46 km s@xmath11 ) and the instrumental resolution ( @xmath47 km s@xmath11 ) . finally , we add continuum veiling to these rotationally broadened synthetic spectra and find the veiling value that provides the best match between observed and synthetic data .",
    "fitted veilings are @xmath48 and @xmath49 in january and may , respectively .",
    "the two measurements are thus consistent within the 1-@xmath50 statistical errors .",
    "@xcite used this procedure to derive veilings from nirspec data .",
    "they tested the method with observations of unveiled mk standard stars , and found that a correction was needed to produce zero veilings for these stars .",
    "they suggested that scattered light inside the nirspec instrument may have led to an instrumental veiling contribution .",
    "since the aries spectrograph has not been characterized in this way , we need to test for such systematic effects . using our observed spectrum of gj 568 , which is an unveiled m3v main - sequence star @xcite",
    ", we can constrain any possible instrumental veiling .",
    "we estimate the veiling for gj 568 using the procedure described above with @xmath51 k , @xmath52 , and @xmath44 km s@xmath11 ( figure [ fig : gj568veiling ] ) .",
    "we find @xmath53 .",
    "if we assume that the instrumental veiling is independent of spectral type , at least across the m3 to k7 range , then we can use the derived veiling for gj 568 a to correct the veilings inferred for tw hya .",
    "the corrected veilings for tw hya are @xmath54 and @xmath55 in january and may , respectively .",
    "the inferred veilings in the two epochs are consistent with each other and with with a previous measurement by @xcite .",
    "the variation in br@xmath0 emission line - strength between our two observed epochs , and between previous measurements in the literature , suggests that the rate at which gas is being accreted by the central star is changing with time .",
    "however , the amount of dusty material in the inner disk does not appear to change significantly , based on the inferred veilings .",
    "our measured photometry is consistent with the 2mass magnitude , providing further evidence that the amount of matter in the inner disk of tw hya is not changing substantially with time .",
    "several mechanisms for creating the optically thin clearing in the tw hya disk have been proffered ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including planets , which may clear gaps about their orbits @xcite ; photoevaporation of inner disk material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; or grain growth , which would deplete the population of small grains that would produce the near - ir emission . the accretion rates measured here are difficult to reconcile with euv - driven photoevaporation scenarios @xcite , although not necessarily with euv+x - ray - driven photoevaporation models @xcite .",
    "the sharp edge of the tw hya disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) seems to argue against grain growth .",
    "while a planetary explanation may be favored , it too is problematic since the massive outer disk of tw hya should cause rapid migration and destruction of planet - mass objects unless the disk is unusually inviscid ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while a 10 jupiter - mass planet has been claimed to orbit tw hya at 0.04 au @xcite , this would not dynamically effect the outer disk edge at @xmath3 au",
    "moreover , follow - up observations demonstrate that the claimed planetary signal is more likely due to starspot noise @xcite .",
    "any of the mechanisms discussed above are compatible with time - variable accretion .",
    "time - variable accretion in the outer disk  for example , due to changes in mri turbulence  can lead to a larger flow of material through the inner disk , even if the flow is impeded by a planet or photoevaporation .",
    "in fact , the inner disk accretion rate can vary indpendently since it too may be driven by mri turbulence @xcite .    while our data indicate a changing accretion rate with time , the low veilings observed at both epochs indicate a small and nearly constant amount of dust in the optically thin region . a constant dust content with time",
    "is also compatible with the unchanging @xmath27-band magnitude inferred from our data .",
    "in fact , the lack of optically thick dust in the inner disk  at any observed epoch  is surprising if one makes a simple estimate of the disk column density .",
    "for this calculation , we assume @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we take the disk scale height to be a constant fraction of the radius , @xmath58 .",
    "the pressure in the disk is thus @xmath59 .    for the accretion rates derived here ( @xmath21 m@xmath10 yr@xmath11 ) , and assuming a viscous disk with @xmath60",
    ", we derive a disk surface density at @xmath61 au of @xmath62 and a disk density of @xmath63 if we assume @xmath64 ( appropriate for sub - micron - sized dust ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and take a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 , then the vertical optical depth of the disk at 1 au is @xmath65 even for accretion rates lower by an order of magnitude , such as those inferred in previous studied ( section [ sec : intro ] ) , @xmath66 for this simple , viscous disk calculation .    to explain the lack of dust in the inner disk , we propose three possible scenarios , all of which may operate in the tw hya system .",
    "the first is that the density could be over - estimated .",
    "an @xmath8disk may not be the correct description for the inner disk of tw hya , or a higher value of @xmath8 may be appropriate . a gas - to - dust ratio @xmath67 could also help to maintain a higher accretion rate with a smaller column of dusty material .",
    "however , observations suggest that the gas - to - dust ratio in tw hya  at least as measured in the outer disk  may be substantially _ smaller _ than 100 @xcite .",
    "the second possible explanation is dust - filtering , where the pressure gradient at the inner edge of the optically - thick disk leads to super - keplerian velocities , and hence trapping , of dust particles in a certain particle - size range ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by preventing dust from reaching the inner disk , filtering can maintain an optically thin region .",
    "moreover , even if the gas flow through the inner disk varies , filtering may trap ( some of ) the additional dust particles in the flow , preventing variations in observed veiling .",
    "finally , radiation pressure from the star can help to drive dust particles out of the inner disk .",
    "alone , this mechanism is unlikely to clear out the inner disk or tw hya , since an optically thick disk can be replenished by accretion faster than material can be blown out ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , if the inner disk is optically thin to begin with , for example due to dust filtering , then radiation pressure acts directly on all dust in the system and can be an efficient means of removal ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "radiation pressure and dust filtering act in a complementary way .",
    "dust filtering is most efficient for particles with sizes of tens of microns , since these are not too well coupled to the gas but do nt have the inertia of larger bodies @xcite .",
    "radiation pressure is most effective for smaller particles , with sizes @xmath68 @xmath4 m ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , small particles that pass through the `` filter '' into the inner disk may be pushed back out by radiation pressure .",
    "the combination of filtering and radiation pressure may be sufficiently efficient to maintain an inner disk virtually devoid of dust even during periods of enhanced gaseous accretion .                                                    , j.  r. , carr , j.  s. , glassgold , a.  e. , & valenti , j.  a. 2007 , in protostars and planets v , b. reipurth , d. jewitt , and k. keil ( eds . ) , university of arizona press , tucson , 951 pp .",
