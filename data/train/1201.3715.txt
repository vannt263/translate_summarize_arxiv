    "one of the most intriguing feature of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) globular clusters ( gcs ) system is the large population of binary clusters that this galaxy harbors .",
    "the catalogue by @xcite includes a total of 473 candidate multiple ( binary or triple ) stellar clusters and associations with angular distances @xmath41.4 arcmin ( corresponding to a projected distance of 20 pc when a distance modulus of 18.5 mag is assumed ) and ages less than @xmath51 gyr .",
    "this sample corresponds to about 10% of the entire stellar clusters population in the lmc .",
    "similar binary systems are observed also in other galaxies , like the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) @xcite , m31 @xcite and ngc  5128 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in our galaxy the only recognized case is the open cluster pair ngc  869/ngc  884 .",
    "there are some possible scenarios to explain the nature of the binary clusters : ( i )  two clusters at different distances appear as a binary system only due to projection effects , lying along the same line of sight ; ( ii )  the clusters were born independently from distinct molecular clouds ( likely with different ages and chemical compositions ) and subsequently became a bound system after a close encounter or a tidal capture ; ( iii )  the clusters were born from the same molecular cloud ( hence with the same age and metallicity ) and are gravitationally bound . based on statistical arguments , @xcite suggest that the lmc binary clusters population can not be simply explained in terms of apparent pairs , but a relevant fraction must be bound systems .    while the large number of binary clusters among the young magellanic globulars is a significant clue , the small projected distance on the sky between two clusters can not guarantee the effective _ blood tie _ of the objects .",
    "hints on binarity from the ages and photometric metallicities ( with uncertainties at a level of 0.2 dex ) have been provided for some tens of cluster pairs ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , a firm validation of that binarity can only be obtained from the combined information of age , chemical abundances from high resolution spectra and radial velocities ( @xmath0 ) measurements in order to clarify if the system is gravitationally bound and unveil the possible common origin from the same molecular cloud . at present",
    "such a binarity validation has not been probed in any lmc cluster pair .",
    "this paper is devoted to address the true nature of the cluster pair ngc  2136/ngc  2137 .",
    "these are two young gcs with an angular separation of 1.34 arcmin @xcite , corresponding to a projected separation of @xmath519.5 pc , assuming a distance of 50 kpc ( see left panel in fig .",
    "[ map ] ) .",
    "previous studies stated that the two clusters share the same age ( @xmath580 - 100 myr , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but no direct chemical and kinematical measurements are available to date .",
    "observations were performed with the multi - fiber facility flames mounted at the eso very large telescope in the combined mode uves+giraffe .",
    "data were acquired under a program devoted to investigate the chemical composition of the lmc gcs and their surrounding fields the employed grating configuration includes the setups hr  11 and hr  13 for giraffe and the 580 red arm for uves . a total of 5 exposures of @xmath545 min each was secured on the same targets configuration .",
    "the reduction of the spectra ( including bias subtraction , flat - fielding , wavelength calibration and spectra extraction ) was performed with the standard eso pipelines .",
    "typical signal - to - noise ratio per pixel of the final coadded spectra is of @xmath550 - 60 .",
    "the flames fibers were allocated on giant stars of the two clusters ngc  2136 and ngc  2137 and of the surrounding field .",
    "targets in the innermost 2.5 arcmin from the cluster center have been selected from the sofi near - infrared catalog by @xcite while outermost objects were chosen from the 2mass dataset .",
    "it is worth noting that the size of the clusters , their angular separation and the physical size of the flames magnetic buttons do not allow to allocate a large number of fibers on the area covered by two clusters .",
    "a total of 22 fibers were finally allocated in the inner 3 arcmin ( marked in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ map ] ) .",
    "here we discuss the kinematical and chemical properties of these stars .",
    "interestingly enough , @xcite suggest a possible third component of the system , identifying a faint stellar association located at a distance of @xmath52.4 arcmin from the main cluster and embedded in a common stellar halo ( the position of this stellar association is highlighted in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ map ] ) .",
    "as apparent from the right panel of fig .  [ map ] ,",
    "one flames fiber was allocated also on this loose clump of stars .",
    "radial velocities were derived by using the daospec code @xcite and measuring @xmath5370 and @xmath5140 absorption lines of different elements in the uves and giraffe spectra , respectively .",
    "typical internal errors ( computed as @xmath6 ) are of 0.05 for uves and 0.15 km / s for giraffe .",
    "the accuracy of the zero - point of the wavelength calibration is checked by measuring several sky emission lines and compared with their restframe positions listed by @xcite : the uncertainty in the zero - point has been added in quadrature to the internal error .",
    "the chemical analysis was performed by using the suite of codes by r. l. kurucz ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , aimed to compute model atmospheres , abundances from the observed equivalent widths and synthetic spectra .",
    "the employed model atmospheres were computed with atlas9 , assuming plane - parallel geometry , lte for all the species and no overshooting .",
    "we used suitable linelists checked against spectral blending , in order to include only transitions predicted to be unblended for the corresponding spectral resolution and parameters .",
    "oscillator strengths are from the most recent version of the kurucz / castelli linelist .",
    "equivalent widths were measured with daospec .",
    "atmospheric parameters were derived spectroscopically , by requiring _ ( i ) _  no trend between excitation potential and iron abundance to constrain the temperature ; _ ( ii ) _  no trend between line strength and iron abundance to constrain the microturbulent velocity , and _ ( iii ) _  the same abundance from neutral and single ionized iron lines to constrain the gravity .",
    "we measured abundances for fe , ni , mg , o , al , na , si , ca , ti . oxygen abundances are derived through spectral synthesis of the forbidden line at 6300 @xmath7 . na abundances were derived from the doublet at 6154 - 60 @xmath7 for all the stars and also from the line at 5688 @xmath7 for the stars observed with uves ; departures from lte were corrected following @xcite .",
    "the total uncertainty for each abundance ratio was computed by adding in quadrature the internal error ( computed as @xmath6 ) and the uncertainty arising from the atmospheric parameters ( the latter computed following the approach by * ? ? ?",
    "the heliocentric radial velocity @xmath0 distribution for all the 22 giants measured in the region of the two clusters is shown in the upper panel of figure 2 . as can be seen , it is highly peaked at @xmath8 km / s .",
    "the lower panel of figure 2 shows metallicities and radial velocities for the stars with @xmath9 km / s . a clear , well defined clump of 11 stars sharing virtually the same radial velocity ( @xmath10 270 km / s ) and metallicity ( @xmath11\\sim$]0.40 ) is visible .",
    "main information for these stars are listed in table 1 and their position in the sofi color - magnitude diagram is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ cmd ] , together with portions of uves spectra in the right panel .",
    "they are also marked in the right panel of fig .",
    "the close inspection of this map allows to attribute each star to one of the two clusters : we have attributed 7 stars to ngc  2136 and 4 stars to ngc  2137 .    considering the entire sample of 11 stars , the mean radial velocity turns out to be of 271.2@xmath10.3 km / s with a dispersion @xmath2=  1.0 km / s . when we consider separately the stars belonging to each individual cluster we obtain @xmath12 km / s ( @xmath2=  1.0 km / s ) and 270.6@xmath10.4 km / s ( @xmath2=  0.9 km / s ) for ngc  2136 and ngc  2137 , respectively . the two measurements are fully compatible at a level of 1.6@xmath20.1 km / s only . ] and also compatible with the lmc velocity distribution , which peaks at @xmath5257 km / s ( @xmath2=  25 km / s , * ? ? ?",
    "no previous measurements of radial velocities of member stars in these clusters were available in the literature .",
    "the average iron content is [ fe / h]=  0.40@xmath10.01 dex and 0.39@xmath10.01 dex for ngc  2136 and ngc  2137 respectively .",
    "these are the very first direct measurements of chemical abundances in these clusters since previous estimates of the metallicity were based only on photometry .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite derived lower metallicities ( [ fe / h]=  -0.55 dex with a typical uncertainty of about 0.2 dex ) .",
    "table 1 lists the abundance ratios for each individual star and table 2 lists the average abundances for the measured chemical elements .",
    "as can be seen the two clusters share virtually identical abundance patterns either in terms of iron , @xmath13 and light elements . in particular , all the [ @xmath3/fe ] abundance ratios are roughly solar , pointing out that the gas from which both clusters formed has been enriched also by type ia supernovae ejecta , as expected given their young age .",
    "_ this is the first clear - cut indication that stars in the two clusters are virtually indistinguishable both in terms of metallicity and radial velocity .",
    "also , this is the first time that the real nature of a binary cluster is revealed . _",
    "note that the star observed in the possible third component of the system ( plotted as a black circle in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ map ] ) has @xmath14 km / s and an iron content [ fe / h]=  0.54 dex , incompatible with the chemical and kinematical properties of the two clusters : this seems to exclude a link between this star and the two clusters . at present , we are not able to assess if this stellar association is really bound to the other two clusters , hence we exclude it from the following discussion .",
    "from the analysis of the kinematical and chemical properties of the two clusters we obtained two relevant findings :    _ ( i ) - all the measured stars share very similar @xmath0 : indeed , the difference between the average values in the two clusters is only @xmath15 km / s .",
    "_ such a small value well agrees with the criterion by @xcite for the gravitational link of two stellar systems . in order to compute the orbital velocity of the binary system , we first estimated the cluster masses .",
    "the simbad database provides integrated v magnitudes of 10.70 and 12.66 for the main and secondary cluster respectively , corresponding to @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath19 . adopting the mass - to - light ratio of @xmath20=0.119 , appropriate for a simple stellar population of 100 myr , z=0.008 and solar - scaled chemical composition computed from the basti database , we obtain masses of @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath22 ( with a mass ratio of 0.16).= 1.99 @xmath22 , 2.19 @xmath22 and 2.09 @xmath22 adopting the king , power - law and wilson model , respectively . since no estimate was obtained for ngc  2137 , in the following we will adopt the masses derived from the integrated v magnitudes . ] with these mass values and by assuming a circular orbit and @xmath24 , ( where @xmath25 is the projected distance , with @xmath25=  19.5 pc ) as a statistical proxy of the de - projected , three - dimensional distance , the orbital period can be easily inferred from the third kepler s law , yielding a value of @xmath2687 myr .",
    "finally , the orbital velocity ( computed as @xmath27 ) turns out to be @xmath281.7 km / s .",
    "this value indicates the maximum expected difference between the velocities of the two clusters .",
    "such a small value is in excellent agreement with the observations and enforce our statement that the two objects are gravitationally bound .    _",
    "( ii ) - the two clusters share the same chemical abundances and abundance pattern , in terms of iron and @xmath13 elements , suggesting that they likely formed from the collapse of the same ( chemically homogeneous ) molecular cloud_. interestingly enough , the two clusters also show similar and homogeneous abundances of the light elements ( na , o , mg and al ) , at variance with the old gcs in our galaxy ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and in the lmc @xcite , which show clear spreads and some anti - correlations . such a lack of abundance spread among light elements has been already found in a few other lmc gcs of young / intermediate ages @xcite with metallicity similar to the ngc  2136/ngc  2137 pair . from this point of view",
    ", the lmc gcs younger than @xmath53 gyr behave like the galactic open clusters , that do not show evidences of abundance anomalies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this finding seems to indicate that while older globulars in both our galaxy and in the lmc self - enriched at the very early stage of their formation ( in the age range between 20 myr and 300 myr , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and were much more massive in the past ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to be able to retain the stellar ejecta , younger and less massive clusters did not undergo self - enrichment processes and their present - day mass should be very similar to their initial mass ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the observational evidences presented here confirm the theoretical predictions that clusters with initial mass below @xmath29 should be chemically homogeneous ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it is worth to notice that stellar clusters with ages of @xmath5100 myr and masses of @xmath51 - 5 @xmath30 are lacking in our galaxy , the open clusters in the milky way being at least 1 order of magnitude less massive than the coeval lmc globulars .",
    "hence , the study of such young lmc clusters appears to be particularly illuminating to understand the early evolution of the globulars .",
    "concerning the final fate of the ngc  2136/ngc  2137 system , two possible scenario can be prospected : ( i )  the two clusters will finally merge under the action of the dynamical friction ; or ( ii )  the mutual tidal forces will disrupt the less massive system , dispersing its stellar content ( and probably leaving a weak stellar stream around the survived cluster ) .",
    "the dynamical friction timescale , hence the time for the secondary cluster to spiral into the main cluster , can be estimated with eq.7 - 26 of @xcite , assuming the present - day conditions .",
    "we derive a merging time - scale of @xmath538 myr , comparable with the orbital period . however , this scenario is reliable only if the secondary cluster crosses the main cluster : @xcite derive for ngc  2136 a tidal radius of 30.9 pc by adopting a king model , larger than the projected distance between the two clusters ( @xmath31 pc ) .",
    "hence , we can consider realistic the occurrence of dynamical friction between the two objects . alternatively , ngc  2137 will be destroyed by the tidal field of ngc  2136 , in a time - scale of @xmath52 gyr , estimated by adopting eq . 1 by @xcite .",
    "due to the uncertainty in the mass values and in the 3-d distance , these calculations should be considered as a first - order estimation of the timescales .",
    "the perspective of a merging is quite interesting in light of the formation history of the lmc gcs . numerical simulations by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    "predict that the final merger of a binary cluster would be indistinguishable from a genuine single - population gc , but with high values of ellipticity ( @xmath32=  0.25 - 0.35 ) , very similar to those observed in the lmc gcs ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this framework , we can not exclude that a fraction of the present - day single lmc clusters were originated by the merging of twin objects ( in terms of kinematics , age and chemical composition ) .",
    "the analysis of the kinematical and chemical properties of the pair ngc  2136/ngc  2137 presented in this paper demonstrate that the two clusters share not only the same age @xcite but also the same chemical and kinematic _ dna _ , unequivocally ensuring their common origin .",
    "_ this is the first firm validation of the true binary nature of a lmc cluster pair _ : the previous hints were in fact only based on their projected distances and photometric properties . from the obtained results we can also draw a general scenario for the formation and evolution of this binary system . summarizing : ( i )  the two clusters formed from the fragmentation of the same molecular cloud ; ( ii )  the chemical composition of the clusters is about the same , without hints of self - enrichment or mutual chemical pollution ; ( iii )  the present - day orbital parameters suggest that the system will merge due to the dynamical friction in a timescale comparable with its orbital period .    an important point to tackle is the different frequency of candidate binary clusters in the lmc and in the milky way .",
    "theoretical models by @xcite and @xcite demonstrate that binary stellar clusters can be formed during high velocity cloud collisions . concerning the lmc , the rate of cloud collisions is mainly triggered by the mutual tidal interaction between the lmc and the smc , and their close encounters ( the last one occuring @xmath5200 myr ago * ? ? ? * ) on the other hand , the galactic disk is less disturbed by the near tidal fields , at variance to the lmc ( that suffers of the effects due to the interaction with the galaxy and smc fields ) , and the rate of cloud - cloud collisions is less efficient , as demonstrated by the dearth of binary systems among the milky way open clusters .",
    "thus , the occurrence of binary clusters is intimately linked to the star formation history of their parent galaxy and the interactions of the latter with near tidal fields .",
    "our findings indicate that other candidate cluster pairs in the lmc could be probed to be binary systems through the analysis of high - resolution spectra .",
    "direct kinematical and chemical measurements of such systems ( with both similar and different component clusters ages ) are mandatory to assess the origin of these systems and enlighten on the cluster formation history in the magellanic clouds . + we warmly thank the anonymous referee for his / her suggestions in improving the paper .",

    "<S> we have used a sample of high - resolution spectra obtained with the multi - fiber facility flames at the very large telescope of the european southern observatory , to derive the kinematical and chemical properties of the two young large magellanic cloud globular clusters ngc  2136 and ngc  2137 . </S>",
    "<S> these two clusters represent a typical example of lmc cluster pair suspected to be bound in a binary system : indeed the cluster centers of gravity have an angular separation of less than 1.4 arcmin in the sky . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral analysis of seven giants in ngc  2136 and four in ngc  2137 reveals that the two clusters share very similar systemic radial velocities , namely @xmath0=  271.5@xmath10.4 km / s ( @xmath2=  1.0 km / s ) and @xmath0=  270.6@xmath10.5 km / s ( @xmath2=  0.9 km / s ) for ngc  2136 and ngc  2137 , respectively , and they have also indistinguishable abundance patterns . </S>",

    "<S> these findings suggest that the two clusters are gravitationally bound and that they formed from the fragmentation of the same molecular cloud that was chemically homogeneous . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first firm confirmation of the binary nature of a lmc cluster pair . </S>",
