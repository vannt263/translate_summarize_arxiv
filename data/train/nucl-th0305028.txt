    "it has been observed a long time ago that the nd scattering length for total three - nucleon spin s=1/2 ( @xmath0 ) is correlated to the @xmath2 binding energy ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this correlation is known as the phillips line  @xcite .",
    "indeed , calculations years later based on simplistic or more realistic nn model forces ( see  @xcite ) yielded quite a few results for the @xmath2 binding energy and the @xmath0 scattering length , which lie on or rather close to a line in the two - dimensional plane spanned by @xmath5 and @xmath0 .",
    "also 3n forces of the @xmath6-exchange type have been added . in  @xcite it was found that this line passes well through the experimental point .    in recent years",
    "chiral perturbation theory and effective theories have been applied to nuclear physics . in the pionless formulation",
    "@xcite , adequate for extreme low energy phenomena , it has been shown that @xmath2 can be energetically stabilized only if a 3n contact force is introduced ( see however  @xcite ) .",
    "in the two lowest orders of that framework there is just one parameter connected to that 3n force .",
    "thus both quantities , @xmath5 and @xmath0 , depend on that one parameter and are therefore correlated though the line does not hit the experimental point . in higher orders additional parameters",
    "show up and the correlation is broken , which makes the two quantities independent .",
    "the same observation was made in an approach based on chiral perturbation theory  @xcite which includes explicitely the pion degrees of freedom . in the next - to - next - to - leading - order ( nnlo )",
    ", 3n forces occur the first time and they depend on two parameters .",
    "this makes @xmath5 and @xmath0 independent and the phillips line correlation is broken .",
    "in fact in that framework the two experimental values are used to fix those two parameters of the 3n force  @xcite .",
    "thus we find it interesting to ask , whether the conventional and high precision nn forces av18  @xcite , cd  bonn  2000  @xcite , nijm  i , nijm  ii , and nijm  93  @xcite alone or in combination with the two most popular 3n force models , urbana  ix  @xcite and tm99  @xcite ( an updated tucson - melbourne @xmath6-exchange 3nf  @xcite modified in view of chiral symmetry ) lead to a strict correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath0 or whether that phillips line correlation is also broken .",
    "further we ask whether the nn and 3nf combinations adjusted to @xmath5 ( or may be only one of them ) also describe @xmath0 .",
    "one more reason to confront @xmath0 to state - of - the - art calculations is the recent appearance of a precision neutron interferometric measurements of the nd coherent scattering length ( @xmath4 )  @xcite .",
    "the coherent scattering length @xmath4 depends in addition to @xmath0 also on the second s - wave scattering length for the state of total 3n spin s=3/2 , @xmath1 . because of the pauli principle this quantity",
    "is supposed not to be sensitive to short range details of nuclear forces .",
    "we want to investigate also that quantity in the light of modern nuclear forces .",
    "then we would like to add two more investigations .",
    "charge - symmetry breaking ( csb ) in the strong nn forces is mostly pronounced in the states @xmath7 , where the scattering length for the neutron - neutron ( nn ) , @xmath8 , and proton - proton ( pp ) , @xmath9 , systems are different .",
    "however the value for @xmath8 is still under debate  @xcite .",
    "therefore we would like to present results , where the nn forces are replaced by the ( strong ) pp forces .",
    "this will provide some insight into the magnitudes of the shifts in @xmath0 caused by small changes in @xmath8 .",
    "the other investigation is due to effects on the scattering lengths and @xmath10 caused by electromagnetic interactions , mostly due to magnetic moment interactions ( mmi ) .",
    "mmi is a relativistic effect and including only that specific force is of course inconsistent , since other relativistic effects are not taken into account ( see for instance  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "but it is interesting to see its separate effect on @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( its effect on the binding energy of @xmath2 and @xmath2e is known and older results have been reconfirmed recently  @xcite ) . here",
    "we hit some `` defects '' in current nn force models .",
    "the nn potentials cd  bonn  2000 , nijm  i , ii , and nijm  93 are fitted directly to the nn data without taking electromagnetic interactions ( emi ) into account ( of course the point coulomb force in case of the pp system has been included ) .",
    "therefore those strong forces include the effects of the mmi s ( and further electromagnetic corrections ) .",
    "if we want to see then the separate effects of the emi s we have to subtract from those model nn forces the emi s and compare to results without that subtraction . in case of",
    "av18 the strong force plus emi s have been fitted to the data . thus the force free of emi s is just the strong av18 force alone . in this manner by comparing results with and without electromagnetic interactions one can see their effects .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ seciii ] the theoretical formulation",
    "is briefly outlined .",
    "the results are given in section  [ seciv ] , and we end with a summary and an outlook in section  [ secv ] .",
    "more technical details are deferred to an appendix .",
    "we use the faddeev scheme . including a three - nucleon force a convenient basic formulation for part of the @xmath11 break - up amplitude @xmath12  @xcite is the integral equation @xmath13    the driving term contains the nn @xmath14-operator @xmath14 , permutation operators @xmath15 , the free 3n propagator @xmath16 and part of the 3n force , @xmath17 .",
    "any 3n force can be split into three pieces , where for instance the first piece is symmetrical under exchange of particles 2 and 3 , the second under 3 - 1 exchange etc .",
    "thus the quantity @xmath17 is the part symmetrical under 2 - 3 exchange like the @xmath14-operator @xmath14 , which is supposed to act on the pair 23 .",
    "finally , @xmath18 is the initial channel state composed of the deuteron state and a momentum eigenstate of the projectile neutron.that integral equation can be solved precisely in a partial wave decomposition in momentum space . for details see  @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath19 for elastic scattering is given in terms of the amplitude @xmath12 by quadrature as follows @xmath20    we want to solve the integral equation ( 1 ) directly at the threshold of nd scattering .",
    "this is for zero initial relative momentum @xmath21 of the projectile and will then lead directly to the scattering length . for the convenience of the reader we briefly sketch the necessary steps  @xcite .",
    "our partial wave momentum space basis is denoted by @xmath22 , where p and q are the magnitudes of standard jacobi momenta and @xmath23 a string of angular momentum and isospin quantum numbers ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "then for @xmath21 in z- direction we define the auxiliary amplitude @xmath24 for the projectile nucleon with orbital angular momentum @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) and total angular momentum @xmath27 combined with the deuteron total angular momentum @xmath28 to total 3n angular momentum @xmath29 .",
    "out of that amplitude one obtains the partial wave projected nd elastic scattering amplitude @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the s- and d - wave components of the deuteron and @xmath32 contains the deuteron quantum numbers .",
    "finally , the projectile spin and the deuteron spin can be combined to the total spin @xmath33 and one obtains @xmath34    the @xmath35- matrix element is then given as @xmath36 leading to the doublet and quartet scattering lengths for @xmath37 @xmath38    one also defines a coherent scattering length @xmath4 as @xmath39    we defer the special form of the faddeev integral equation ( 1 ) at @xmath37 to the appendix .",
    "it is free of singularities and therefore as easily solved as a bound state problem .",
    "also the explicit form of the elastic amplitude for @xmath37 is given there .",
    "we used the nn forces cd  bonn  2000 , av18 , nijm  i , ii and nijm  93 alone or various combinations with the three - nucleon forces urbana  ix , the older tucson - melbourne force and the modified one tm99 .",
    "when we combine the urbana ix 3nf with cd  bonn  2000 the strength of the repulsive part of this 3nf has been reduced by multiplying it with the factor 0.812 in order to get the proper @xmath5 .    due to their nonnegligible influence on the nd scattering lengths",
    ", we took special care of electromagnetic interactions . in the case of the av18 potential it is clear how to separate the strong av18 force from the electromagnetic parts because both are well defined and added together in fitting the total force to the nn data . in case of the np system the emi s",
    "are given in eqs .",
    "( 11 ) , ( 12 ) , and ( 15 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite and in eq .",
    "( 16 ) for the nn system ( for the np system we did not include the very small class iv charge asymmetric force @xmath40 .",
    "also we neglected the energy dependence of the @xmath41 ) .",
    "this is different for the cd  bonn  2000 and nijmegen potentials , which were fitted directly to the nn data without adding to them electromagnetic interactions , with the exception of the point coulomb force in case of the pp system . therefore to define the strong forces in the particular nn system one needs to subtract the corresponding emi , which we assumed to be given as in ref",
    ".  @xcite . to be precise for the np system we subtract from the np cd bonn and the nijmegen",
    "forces the np emi s as defined above .",
    "similarly for the nn system we subtract from cd bonn the mmi as defined above . since we also want to see the effect of replacing the strong nn force by the strong pp force we have also to define the strong pp cd bonn and nijmegen forces . in this case",
    "we subtract from those potentials the pp emi s as given in eqs .",
    "( 3)-(8 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite without the leading 1 in @xmath42 from eq .",
    "( 10 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , since the point coulomb force has been taken into account for those potentials fitting to the pp data .",
    "before we report on our results we give some comments on our numerical accuracy . as usual",
    "the partial wave decomposition is truncated at a certain total two - body angular momentum @xmath43 .",
    "[ fig1 ] documents the convergence of @xmath0 as function of @xmath43 .",
    "this shows that we reached an accuracy of about three digits .",
    "this is for cd  bonn  @xcite alone and valid also for the other nn forces alone . adding a three - nucleon force we were limited to @xmath44 due to computer resources",
    "nevertheless , as fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] documents , the convergence reached for @xmath0 is two digits . in case of @xmath1 with nn forces alone",
    "we reach 4 digits convergence and including a 3n force an accuracy close to that .",
    "this is documented in fig .",
    "the other numerical ingredients ( discretization in the momenta ) are safely under control . in all calculations we took into account charge dependence of the nn forces using a simple `` @xmath45 '' rule to generate t - matrices in isospin @xmath46 2n states  @xcite .",
    "the total isospin @xmath47 3n states have been neglected  @xcite . we checked that their inclusion does not change @xmath1 up to the fifth digit and the change of @xmath0 is of the order of @xmath48 .",
    "the triton binding energies have been obtained using @xmath49 .",
    "they are accurate to @xmath50  kev .    as an overview",
    "we show all our results for @xmath0 and @xmath5 in fig .",
    "we see a group of results in the right half of the figure based on nn forces alone and another group close to the experimental area including 3n forces .",
    "we performed several investigations .",
    "first we take cd  bonn  2000 as it is ( fitted to the nn data ) and use the np - nn force combinations appropriate to the nd system . in this way the emi s in the np and nn systems are effectively included inside the strong forces . in case of av18",
    "we keep all electromagnetic corrections as in  @xcite except the energy dependence of @xmath41 ( mmi s for the nn system and the mmi s together with the one photon coulomb term @xmath51 for the np system ) .",
    "the corresponding two predictions are shown as stars in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "secondly we want to see the effect of replacing the strong nn forces by the strong pp forces .",
    "the difference between nn and pp strong forces is mostly located in the different scattering lengths @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( strong ) and will therefore give some information how changes in @xmath8 will show up in changes of @xmath0 .",
    "since thereby we do not want to change the emi s we keep in case of av18 the nn mmi . for the cd bonn and",
    "the nijmegen potentials the strong pp potentials are defined as above and the nn mmi ( as for av18 ) is added .",
    "the results are shown as the 5 open circles in fig 4 . as seen in case of cd bonn 2000 and av18",
    "the @xmath3h binding energy is decreased and @xmath52 increased . for the nijmegen potentials such a comparison is not done , since no nn forces have been introduced .",
    "the effects on the 3n binding energies are known .",
    "these two first investigations provide theoretical predictions for the nd scattering lengths and triton binding energy including all electromagnetic interactions similarly as is the case for the measured values .    in the next two investigations we address the effects of the electromagnetic interactions themselves by switching them off while generating theoretical predictions .",
    "for the av18 potential we take just the np - nn and np - pp strong force combinations alone , while in the cases of cd  bonn  2000 , nijm  i , ii , and 93 we only use the corresponding strong forces stripped off from the emi s , as described above .",
    "the resulting theoretical predictions are shown as pluses and squares in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for the np - nn and np - pp combinations , respectively .",
    "again the binding energy is decreased and @xmath52 increased .",
    "the individual results of these four investigations are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] also as dashed ( np - nn with emi s ) , dotted ( np - pp with emi s ) , solid ( np - nn ) , and dashed - dotted ( np - pp ) straight lines fitted in a @xmath53 sense .",
    "these lines include also the corresponding results including 3nf s ( see below ) .",
    "we see a small shift of the lines under exchanges of nn versus pp forces , but a more significant shift if the electromagnetic forces are switched off .",
    "though the two curves ( dashed and dotted ) for the cases when the electromagnetic forces are added come close to the experimental range spanned by the uncertainty in @xmath0 , they miss it clearly .",
    "when the electromagnetic forces are switched off the np - nn ( solid ) and np - pp ( dashed - dotted ) lines go through the experimental point well inside the @xmath0 error bar .",
    "now we want to regard our results in more detail as displayed in table  [ tab1 ] and in the inset of fig .",
    "the theory has to be finally compared to the experimental values , which are @xmath54  fm  @xcite , @xmath55  fm  @xcite , and @xmath56  fm  @xcite .",
    "the results in table  [ tab1 ] are grouped into nn force predictions only and selected combinations with the 3n forces tm , tm99 and urbana  ix .",
    "for each potential or potential combination we show the results for the various scattering lengths and the @xmath3h binding energies .",
    "this is given for the np - pp nn forces , with ( without ) emi s in the first ( second ) row .",
    "for av18 and cd  bonn  2000 we also show the results for np - nn forces with ( third row ) and without ( fourth row ) electromagnetic interactions .",
    "note that in case of the np - nn forces including emi s ( as described above ) the combinations with tm99 and urbana  ix are fitted well to the experimental value -8.48 mev of the @xmath3h binding energy .",
    "this is also the case for nijm  i and ii , which , however , refers to the np - pp forces .",
    "for the older tm 3n force we did not perform a precise ( re)fit and the results are only included in view of investigating , whether a straight line correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath5 exists . a glance at fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] tells that the individual results scatter around the four straight lines .",
    "thus obviously no straight line correlation exist ( this has been known before , though for some older calculations the numerical accuracy might be not sufficient to give a reliable judgement ) .",
    "let us now concentrate on the group of results with 3n forces .",
    "these are displayed in the inset of fig .",
    "we see four results ( stars ) for the np - nn forces including tm99 or urbana  ix , where the binding energy has been exactly fitted but where the @xmath0 value is too small .",
    "these are the results achieved under the supposedly most realistic assumptions in this paper . if one switches off the electromagnetic interaction ( pluses ) the binding energy increases and interestingly @xmath0 moves to larger values .",
    "regarding all results , the inclusion of the electromagnetic force in our studies shows that they cause shifts of up to about 40 kev less binding energy and of up to about 0.04 fm decrease in @xmath0 . in no case",
    "studied the experimental value of @xmath0 is reproduced for np - nn and np - pp strong forces combined with different 3nf s with exception of np - pp av18 combined with tm 3nf , for which the theoretical prediction lies at the lower limit of the error bar .",
    "as one learned from the approach in chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , where two parameters are needed to fix the short range 3n forces at nnlo and consequently two 3n observables to adjust them , one could foresee that the straight lines in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] could only by accident pass through the experimental region .",
    "for the conventional forces used in this paper , one can think of additional 3n force diagrams ( the most obvious one the @xmath57 exchange ) where a sufficient number of parameters would be available to fit both , @xmath5 and @xmath0 .",
    "going back to table  [ tab1 ] we see that @xmath1 sticks always close to the value 6.34 for the np - pp and np - nn nn force choices , without or with 3n forces and with emi s included .",
    "this is well within the experimental @xmath1 error bar .",
    "interestingly , the electromagnetic interactions increase @xmath1 in nearly all cases by about 0.02 and the pure strong force predictions lie always outside the experimental error bar .",
    "finally , one can confront theory to the very precisely known experimental value of the coherent scattering length @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "clearly the supposedly most realistic dynamics ( nn - np nn forces plus tm99 or urbana ix 3nf s ) misses that value .",
    "as can be seen from table  [ tab1 ] , when electromagnetic interactions are included the np - pp force combination reaches the experimental value in case of the av18 and cd  bonn  2000 potentials combined with urbana ix and av18 with tm99 .",
    "however , this agreement is accidental and caused by the corresponding decrease in @xmath2 binding .",
    "a recently performed precise neutron interferometric measurement of the nd coherent neutron scattering length  @xcite and a planned precision measurement of the doublet nd scattering length  @xcite stimulated us to investigate the theoretical predictions of that quantity for the high precision nn forces cd  bonn  2000 , av18 , nijm  i , ii and 93 in combination with currently popular 3n force models .",
    "these are the modified @xmath6-exchange tucson - melbourne ( tm99 ) and the urbana  ix 3n forces .",
    "we have chosen several nn and 3nf combinations , which are separately adjusted to the @xmath2 binding energy . for nn forces alone with and without emi s we recovered the approximate correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath0 , but the scatter around a thought straight line ( phillips line ) inside the band spanned by the 4 lines in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is quite strong . adding 3n forces shifts the values into the neighbourhood of the experimental range of @xmath0 , but misses the experimental value including its error bar in all cases , when electromagnetic forces are included .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] clearly shows that for equal or nearly equal @xmath3h binding energies @xmath0 can vary significantly and vice versa .",
    "thus one has to conclude that @xmath0 has to be considered as a low energy observable , which is independent from the @xmath2 binding energy .",
    "this observation has been found before in approaches based on pure effective field theory ( pionless formulation ) and on chiral perturbation theory ( including pion degrees of freedom ) .",
    "thus in future investigations , adjusting both observables , @xmath5 and @xmath0 , for conventional nuclear forces will require more flexibility in the choice of 3n forces . adding more mechanisms ( on top of the @xmath6-exchange ) for 3n forces should be no obstacle .",
    "this is a step already performed in the effective theory approaches  @xcite .",
    "we also investigated the effects on @xmath0 resulting from electromagnetic interactions given in  @xcite .",
    "the effects on @xmath0 and even @xmath1 are noticeable . for @xmath0",
    "including the electromagnetic interactions reduces its value by up to 0.04 fm .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath1 is perfectly stable under all exchanges of nuclear forces studied in this paper but the electromagnetic interactions affect its value , though only in the 3rd digit .",
    "however , only when emi s are included the experimental value is reproduced .",
    "the effects of adding the electromagnetic interactions on the @xmath2 binding energy are well known and can reach shifts of up to 40 kev less binding energy .    due to the failure to describe @xmath0",
    "also the recently newly measured coherent scattering length @xmath4 can not be reproduced theoretically .",
    "the good reproduction of @xmath1 by all interactions and the small error bar of the coherent scattering length suggests that the value of the doublet nd scattering length might be somewhat smaller than the presently one , namely around 0.63 fm , different from the present experimental value of @xmath0 .",
    "this strongly calls for a new , more precise measurement .",
    "since the scattering lengths are ( extreme ) low energy observables , it appears that the mentioned effective theory approaches are the most adequate ones . because one works there below a certain momentum cut off , which is smaller than the nucleon mass , they allow also to incorporate relativistic effects in a well defined and converged manner .",
    "also 3n forces appear in those approaches in a well organised manner , according to a certain power counting scheme , and are consistent to the nn forces .",
    "in other words , one can take into account all these subtle effects , relativity , 3n forces , isospin breaking , in a well controlled and systematic manner . in conventional approaches on the other hand , which include a lot of phenomenological parametrisations and where no momentum cut - off is used , a reliable treatment of relativistic effects poses still a problem and the choices of 3n force mechanisms are also quite open . therefore in conventional approaches physically reliable predictions to @xmath0 will very likely remain a challenge for quite some time .",
    "this appendix summarizes various expressions exactly at the nd threshold @xmath37 .",
    "the first part of the driving term in eq.([eq:1 ] ) turns out to be @xmath58 the quantities with index 0 refer to the initial state .      for",
    "our notation see  @xcite .",
    "the deuteron binding energy is written as @xmath65 .",
    "the remaining parts related to @xmath17 can be worked out correspondingly and can be found in  @xcite .",
    "evaluating the elastic scattering amplitude one needs it at @xmath66 ( see eq.([eq:4 ] ) ) .",
    "therefore the point @xmath67 was included .",
    "then eq.([eq : a2 ] ) simplifies to @xmath68        this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( j.g.,r.s . ) , by the nfs grant no .",

    "<S> switching them off for the various nuclear force models leads to shifts of up to + 0.04 fm for @xmath0 , which is significant for present day standards . </S>",
    "<S> the electromagnetic effects have also a noticeable effect on @xmath1 , which otherwise is extremely stable under the exchange of the nuclear forces . </S>",

    "<S> there is a strong scatter of the @xmath3h binding energy and the @xmath0 values around an averaged straight line ( phillips line ) . </S>",
