    "recently , much attention has been attracted to the discovery of microwave - induced resistance oscillations ( miro ) @xcite , followed by the spectacular observation of zero - resistance states ( zrs ) in the oscillation minima @xcite .",
    "two microscopic mechanisms of the miro have been proposed : the `` displacement '' mechanism related to the effect of microwaves on the impurity scattering @xcite , and the `` inelastic '' mechanism accounting for nonequilibrium oscillatory changes in the electron distribution @xcite . both mechanisms rely on the energy oscillations of the density of states ( dos ) @xmath0 of disorder - broadened landau levels ( lls ) and reproduce the observed phase of the @xmath1oscillations ( here , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the microwave and the cyclotron frequencies ) .",
    "the inelastic mechanism yields temperature - dependent miro with the amplitude , proportional to the inelastic scattering time @xmath4 , while the displacement contribution is @xmath5-independent , in disagreement with the experiments . at relevant",
    "@xmath6  k , the inelastic effect dominates and the corresponding theory @xcite reproduces the experimental observations @xcite",
    ".    further experimental investigations at elevated microwave power led to the discovery of `` fractional '' miro and zrs @xcite located near the fractional harmonics of the cyclotron resonance , @xmath7 , to be contrasted with the integer miro @xcite .",
    "these remarkable observations motivated the present study where we address multiphoton effects and effects of the microwave radiation on the electronic spectrum , which govern the fractional miro in the case of separated lls .",
    "we start by including the multiphoton processes in the theory @xcite . in a classically strong magnetic field ,",
    "@xmath8 , the diagonal resistivity @xmath9 reads @xcite [ qdrude ] _",
    "xx/_xx^d = d^2()_f ( ) , where @xmath10 is the drude resistivity , @xmath11 the fermi velocity , @xmath12 the transport scattering time , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 the dimensionless density of states ( dos ) of disorder - broadened lls .",
    "the miro originate from the microvave - induced oscillations in the distribution function @xmath15 , which obeys the kinetic equation [ kineq ] f()-f_t()=_n a_n ( -n)[f(-n)-f ( ) ] . here",
    "@xmath16 describes the probability of @xmath17-photon absorption ( emission ) and @xmath18 is the thermal distribution .",
    "the leading contribution to the integer miro comes from the single - photon @xmath19 , where [ a1 ] p_=(/)(ev_f e_)^2/^2(+)^2 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the amplitude of the circularly polarized microwave field @xcite , and @xmath21 is the total ( quantum ) disorder - induced scattering time .",
    "if one assumes , in accord with the experimental conditions , that the temperature is high , @xmath22 , the contribution to @xmath9 of first order in @xmath23 takes the form @xcite [ 1order ] _",
    "xx/_xx^d=^2()_+(/4)p_f ( ) , where @xmath24 denotes the averaging over the period @xmath25 of the dos , and the function @xmath26 oscillates with @xmath27 , @xmath28\\,\\rangle_\\ve.\\ ] ]    in the limit of separated lls , @xmath29 , the dos @xmath30 is a sequence of semicircles of width @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the detuning from the center @xmath33 of the nearest ll . in that case [ f ] f()=(16 ^ 2/3 ^ 2 ^ 3 ) , where @xmath34 is the integer number closest to @xmath27 , and the odd function @xmath35 is nonzero at @xmath36 ( fig .",

    "( [ phi ] ) . ]     and",
    "single - photon transitions within and between lls ( solid lines ) are forbidden , while two - photon processes are allowed .",
    "the microwave - induced sidebands ( [ sb ] ) ( dashed line ) make single - photon processes possible . ]",
    "provided @xmath38 , the oscillatory part of @xmath9 ( [ 1order ] ) is finite only in narrow intervals @xmath39 around the integer values @xmath40 @xcite . outside these intervals @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , single - photon absorption is forbidden , so that @xmath42 as long as multiphoton processes , given by @xmath43 with @xmath44 , are not taken into account .",
    "inclusion of two - photon processes leads to the appearance of the fractional miro in the frequency intervals @xmath45 , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . in these intervals ,",
    "[ 2photon ] _",
    "xx/_xx^d= ^2()_+(3/32)p_^2 f(2 ) , where we used @xmath48 @xcite . the doubling of the argument of the function @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ 2photon ] ) [ as compared to the integer miro , eq .",
    "( [ 1order ] ) ] reflects the two - photon nature of the effect and leads to the emergence of the fractional miro at half - integer @xmath1 . the form and phase of the fractional oscillations ( [ 2photon ] ) reproduce those for the integer miro , eq .",
    "( [ 1order ] ) . similarly to the integer case , there exists @xcite a multiphoton contribution to the fractional miro governed by the displacement mechanism @xcite , which has a similar form but is a factor @xmath50 smaller @xcite than the inelastic one ( [ 2photon ] ) .    with increasing microwave power @xmath23 , the resistivity ( [ 2photon ] ) in the oscillation minima becomes negative , which indicates a transition to the zrs @xcite .",
    "remarkably , like in the integer case @xcite , the leading - order approximation ( [ 2photon ] ) for the multiphoton inelastic effect is sufficient to describe the fractional photoresponse even at such high power , since the second order contribution @xmath51 remains small in the parameter @xmath52 .",
    "using the formalism developed in @xcite , it can be shown that the microwave illumination results in the appearance of `` sidebands '' in the dos , located at distance @xmath2 on both sides of every ll ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . to first order in @xmath23 and assuming again @xmath45 , we obtain the following expression for the microwave - induced sidebands @xcite : [ sb ] ^(sb)()=(p_/8)[(+)+(- ) ]  , where @xmath53 is the unperturbed dos . in the presence of the sidebands ,",
    "single - photon transitions become possible ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , @xmath54 , resulting in the `` sideband '' contribution to the fractional miro , [ rhosb ] _",
    "xx^(sb)/_xx^d=(/64 ^ 2 ) p_^2f(2 ) , which has the same form as the leading two - photon inelastic contribution ( [ 2photon ] ) , but is smaller a factor @xmath55 .",
    "one more contribution originates from the sidebands oscillating in time with frequency @xmath56 .",
    "`` oscillating sideband '' contribution @xcite is symmetric with respect to the detuning from the fractional resonances , in contrast to the antisymmetric @xmath57 , and is a factor @xmath58 smaller than the two - photon contribution ( [ 2photon ] ) .",
    "in the limit of well - separated lls , @xmath59 , the fractional miro are governed by the multiphoton inelastic mechanism , eq .",
    "( [ 2photon ] ) . at @xmath60 ,",
    "the sideband contribution ( [ rhosb ] ) becomes relevant .",
    "close to @xmath25 at which lls start to overlap ; specifically , at @xmath61 , the effect is dominated by the resonant series of multiple single - photon transitions @xcite .",
    "this effect appears at order @xmath62 . in the limit of strongly overlapping lls ,",
    "the fractional features get exponentially suppressed with respect to the integer miro @xcite .",
