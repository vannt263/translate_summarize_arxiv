    "the financial crisis of 2007 - 2008 challenged the mathematical finance community to understand _ connectedness _ in financial systems .",
    "appropriate models need to be developed to understand how risk can propagate between financial objects which might have heretofore been modeled as closed systems .",
    "it is possible that initial shocks , such as changes in interest rate values , changes of commodities prices or reduction in global economic growth , could trigger contagion effects , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it is likely then that some transmission mechanism , such as financial linkages or simply investor irrationality , could cause components of the system to be affected by the initial shock . reduce - form point process models of correlated default , that are usually based on counting processes , are often used to access portfolio credit risk in portfolios of defaultable assets such as loans and corporate defaults . in these models defaults arrive at intensities that are governed by a given system of stochastic differential equations . due to the size of the portfolios computing the distribution of the loss from default in these models is often challenging .",
    "main us banks for example may easily have @xmath0 wholesale loans and @xmath1 mid - market and commercial loans .",
    "mortgage pools with size of @xmath2 are often common .",
    "simulation and analysis of such pools is non - trivial and often quite burdensome .    in this work",
    "we focus on using dynamic portfolio credit risk models to study rare events in large portfolios and default clustering .",
    "we statistically model failure via the classical framework of point processes .",
    "however , we include several distinct and meaningful sources of randomness that can lead to failure of the system itself .",
    "the intensities form an interacting particle system , where the interaction happens through feedback terms and exposure to common systematic risks .",
    "the foundation of the empirically motivated model that we study lies in @xcite . in this work various properties of such models",
    "were investigated , finding that contagion and systematic risk give meaningful insights into clustering of defaults .",
    "typical ( law of large numbers ) and central limit type behavior for such models as the number of components in the system grows have been studied in @xcite .",
    "our interest here is tail behavior and rare events .",
    "one of the principle theoretical attractions of structured finance was that , supposedly , large pools of assets were regular enough that one could accurately price tail events .",
    "in hindsight , however , interaction in large pools proved an achilles heel . interconnections often make a system robust , but they can also act as conduits for failure . in this paper , we seek to understand the mathematics of rare systemic collapse in large interacting systems .",
    "we consider a large system with interacting components that is influenced by an exogenous source of randomness .",
    "there is a central source of interconnection ( a central `` bus '' ) .",
    "failure of any component stresses the central bus , which in turn can cause other components to fail ( a feedback effect ) . in particular , we want to understand how the system can catastrophically fail , and how the feedback mechanism and the exogenous factor interact to produce large failure clusters . along with an understanding of the likelihood of such a failure , we want to understand the structure of pathways to failure . given a statistical description of the interacting system , an understanding of the `` most likely '' pathways to failure",
    "would naturally lead to an understanding of how to control the system to minimize failure and how to sense the onset of failure .    of particular interest",
    "is _ dynamic _ interactions .",
    "the extra dimension of time allows one to compare different possible ways in which a system can end up at a given point .",
    "this may help in early - stage identification of certain phenomena .",
    "our goal here is to develop some of these insights in the model of @xcite . in particular",
    ", we would like to understand _ pathways to systemic collapse_. in the presence of contagion , what are the most likely ways that a pool can suffer large losses ?",
    "as in other engineered systems , characterization of most likely paths to failure can better allow effective intervention .",
    "the heart of our analysis is the theory of _ large deviations _ , e.g. , see the classical manuscripts @xcite .",
    "the theory of large deviations gives a rich framework in which to identify and then prove rates of decay of exponential tails .",
    "two simple examples are well - known ; sanov s theorem , which in its simplest captures the tail behavior of a large collection of i.i.d coin flips , and the freidlin - wentzell theorem , which identifies the most likely way that diffusive perturbations can drive a stable differential equation out of equilibrium . both of these core examples play a role in our analysis , even though the situation is more complex here because the coin flips are neither identically distributed , nor independent .",
    "defaults can be modeled as coin flips , and the effects of contagion can be thought of as random perturbations of a dynamical system .",
    "our main theorems , theorems [ t : ldpheterogeneous1 ] and [ t : ldpheterogeneous2 ] , give the large deviations principle . in the full case , where both contagion and systematic effects are present , the rate function is a combination of a relative entropy ( a `` nonlinear '' sanov s type theorem ) and the freidlin - wentzell action functional",
    ".    tail behavior in static pools is investigated in @xcite and in @xcite the authors study the effect of stochastic recovery on the tail of the loss distribution when the recovery rate depends on the default rate . in @xcite",
    "rare event asymptotics for the loss distribution in the gaussian copula model of portfolio credit risk and related importance sampling questions are studied . in a large deviations analysis of a mean field model in @xcite",
    "the authors take the default intensity of a component in the pool to be a deterministic function of the percentage pool loss due to defaults , see also @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors establish a large time large deviations principle for an interacting system of affine point processes .",
    "in @xcite , the authors study systematic risk [ from endogenous aspect ] via a mean field model of interacting agents . using a model of a two - well potential",
    ", agents can move freely from a healthy state to a failed state .",
    "the authors study probabilities of transition from the healthy to the failed state using large deviations ideas .    in this paper , we consider tail behavior for dynamic heterogeneous pools with stochastic intensity and we are interested in the behavior for large pools of interconnected components .",
    "our contribution is two - fold .",
    "firstly , we develop a large deviations principle for a dynamic point process model of correlated default timing that takes into account both effects of contagion and of systematic , exogenous , risks .",
    "we study the case that the number of constituent firms or components in the network grows .",
    "secondly , we numerically explore the large deviations results which can help understand how default clusters occur in such systems .    in the theoretical side",
    ", we see that the rate function governing the tail events is given explicitly as an additive functional of a freidlin - wentzell action functional and a nonlinear relative entropy , where the nonlinearity originates from the fact that defaults are not independent . the dependence structure and the heterogeneity of the environment , i.e. , the fact that defaults are not identically distributed , complicate the mathematical analysis .",
    "nevertheless , we rigorously obtain a fairly explicit form of the large deviations principle which is amenable to numerical investigations .",
    "in particular , we derive a representation for the rate function which is suitable for numerically computing both the rate function and the most likely path to failure , i.e. , the extremals , in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments .    in the numerical side ,",
    "the numerical experiments illustrate the effect of systematic ( exogenous ) risks and contagion on tail events of such systems .",
    "for instance , as we shall see in the numerical investigations of section [ s : numerics ] , if a large default cluster occurs , the systematic risk is most likely to play a large role in the initial phase , but then its importance decreases ( and thus the contagion effects become more important ) .",
    "moreover , the analysis of the extremals related to the large deviations rate function ( i.e. , the most likely paths to failure ) in heterogeneous pools with two or more types can help understand which types in the pool are more vulnerable to default due to the impact of contagion , and as a consequence the pathway to creation of default clusters .",
    "we end this introduction by mentioning that , even though the interacting system that we study is primarily motivated by issues of systemic risk in large financial networks , its formulation is sufficiently generic to make the analysis and results of broader interest . the physical phenomenon of the failure of an individual component in a network , which could have been caused by an external force , increasing the stress to other components of the network , making the system more likely to fail , is of broader interest and applicability .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ lln ]",
    ", we describe the model , the assumption and recall the law of large numbers result proven in @xcite . in section [ s : mainresults ]",
    "we describe our main results , the large deviations principle for the empirical measure and empirical default rate .",
    "then , in section [ s : numerics ] we perform numerical experiments supporting the theoretical findings .",
    "section [ s : ldpheterogeneous ] contains the proofs of the large deviations results of section [ s : mainresults ] .",
    "we conclude with our conclusions in section [ s : conclusion ] .",
    "we assume that our overall system contains @xmath3 components or subsystems ( where @xmath3 is large ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath4 is an underlying probability triple on which all random variables are defined .    to start ,",
    "let @xmath5 be the stopping time at which the @xmath6-th component ( or particle ) in our system fails .",
    "a failure time @xmath5 has intensity process @xmath7 , which satisfies @xmath8|{\\mathscr{f}}_t,\\ ,",
    "\\tau^{n}_{n}>t\\ } \\approx \\lambda^{{n , n}}_t \\delta\\ ] ] as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the sigma - algebra generated by the entire system up to time @xmath11 . that is , the process defined by @xmath12 is a martingale with respect to @xmath10 .",
    "we want our model to capture several important phenomena .",
    "each component will be affected by three sources of randomness , one of which is unique to the component itself , one that is responsible for contagious effects , and one of which reflects the external environment .",
    "we assume that each component has been engineered to be stable .",
    "we also assume , however , the system is subject to cascading ( or `` contagious '' ) behavior ; failure of any component is likely to lead to failure of more components . in particular , fixing @xmath13 and @xmath14 we consider the model @xmath15 where @xmath16 here the @xmath17 s are an independent collection of standard brownian motions , @xmath18 is also a standard brownian motion , and the @xmath19 s are standard exponential random variables ; the @xmath17 s , @xmath18 and the @xmath19 s are all independent of each other .    in the case",
    "@xmath20 for all @xmath14 , one recovers the classical cir model in credit risk , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath21 reflects the contagious effects and the @xmath22 term is the external source of randomness ( systematic risk ) .",
    "notice that movements in @xmath23 cause correlated changes in each intensity @xmath7 , which then provides a channel for default clustering .",
    "each system s component sensitivity to @xmath23 is measured by the parameter @xmath24 .",
    "then , a default causes a jump of size @xmath25 in the intensity @xmath7 , where @xmath26 .",
    "the mean - reversion of @xmath7 implies that the impact of a default fades away with time , exponentially with rate @xmath27 .",
    "the linear dependence of @xmath28 in the @xmath29 component guarantees that @xmath30 for every @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath31 ( proposition 3.3 in @xcite ) , and makes the analytic computations easier .",
    "as it is demonstrated in @xcite , an important channel for clustering of defaults are self - exciting effects of such types .",
    "proposition 3.3 in @xcite guarantees that under the assumption of an existence of a unique strong solution for the sde for @xmath23 process , the system has a unique strong solution such that @xmath30 for every @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath31 .",
    "the structure of the feedback term , i.e. , the empirical average @xmath32 , is of mean field type , which brings the system ( [ e : main ] ) roughly within the class of mckean - vlasov models , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , as it is also demonstrated in @xcite , the structure of ( [ e : main ] ) presents several difficulties that bring the analysis of such systems outside the scope of the standard setup .",
    "in particular , a key structural difference is that the empirical measure is not on the level of the intensities @xmath33 , but on the level of the default times @xmath5 , i.e. there is an extra level of randomness .",
    "moreover , the interacting particle system is heterogeneous and not homogeneous , there is the presence of the additional term @xmath23 , the coefficients of the intensity dynamics are not bounded and there is a square root degeneracy .",
    "let s define a ` type ' space which describes the @xmath7 s .",
    "define @xmath34 and we denote by @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath36 gives the dynamics of @xmath7 , the response to the loss process @xmath37 , and the initial condition .",
    "let s also define @xmath38 ; this is a @xmath39-valued process which keeps track of the dynamics of @xmath7 and its current value .",

    "let @xmath42 be the collection of subprobability borel measures on @xmath41 ; i.e. , @xmath41 consists of borel measures @xmath43 on @xmath41 such that @xmath44 .",

    "the goal of this paper is to establish a large deviations principle for the empirical loss @xmath52 , namely to study its tail behavior . in this paper",
