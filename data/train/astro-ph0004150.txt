    "the inconsistency between luminous and dynamical mass measurements is well known .",
    "an alternative way to explain this inconsistency without dark matter , is by modified nonrelativistic dynamics ( mond ) for galaxy and galactic systems @xcite @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this theory was later developed into an alternative theory of gravitation by @xcite ( 1984 ) , which we hereafter refer to as the bekenstein - milgrom ( bm ) theory .",
    "mond agrees with the @xcite and @xcite laws , and explains the dynamics in elliptical and spiral galaxies , without the need for dark matter .",
    "it satisfies conservation of energy , momentum , angular momentum , as well as the weak equivalence principle ( @xcite 1984 ) .",
    "recent studies of rotation disks of low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite are in agreement with mond .",
    "departure of mond from newtonian theory is not connected with a distance scale . in mond ,",
    "deviations from newtonian theory become significant for very small accelerations .",
    "the main argument presented is that newtonian gravitation has not been tested for very weak fields and it could be that the theory is not valid in this regime .",
    "other theories modifying newtonian theory were reviewed by @xcite ( 1987 ) .",
    "stability of galactic disks in bm theory was first studied in a wkb approximation by @xcite .",
    "the wkb scheme deals with perturbation wavelengths @xmath8 , much smaller than the involved distances @xmath9 on the disk ( @xmath10 ) . in newtonian gravitation ,",
    "the presence of a dark halo is important in stabilizing the disk against violent bar formation @xcite .",
    "recent n - body simulations for the bm theory , indicate that disks are more stable in mond than in newtonian dynamics with dark halos ( @xcite 1999 ) .    we obtain the conservative hamiltonian that describes the motion of a particle in a previous calculated potential for the bm theory in section [ 2 ] .",
    "this section also includes a summary of the stability theory for phase - space orbits .",
    "orbits in a dwarf galaxy are discussed in section [ 3 ] .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section [ 4 ] .",
    "in the bm theory , the poisson equation for determining the gravitational potential is modified to @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a constant with the dimension of acceleration , set so as to agree with the tully - fisher law ( milgrom @xcite ) , the function @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 ) obeys @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the newtonian gravitational constant . with this particular value of @xmath18 , non - newtonian effects due to the solar gravitational field",
    "are expected to begin only beyond the oort cloud @xcite .",
    "let us assume the existence of a constant external gravitational acceleration @xmath5 due to some source ( e.g. , a neighboring massive galaxy , such as ours ) and a free falling sphere of mass @xmath4 ( e.g. , the center of a dwarf galaxy ) .",
    "sufficiently close to @xmath4 so that @xmath19 , the solution of equation ( [ mond ] ) yields the well known newtonian potential @xmath20    when the solution @xmath21 of equation ( [ mond ] ) implies gravitational accelerations much bigger than the external gravitational acceleration @xmath22 but @xmath23 , spherical symmetry can be assumed and the potential is obtained from equation ( [ mond ] ) in the limit @xmath24 , using gauss s theorem @xmath25 in the opposite limit , when @xmath26 , @xcite ( 1984 ) have calculated the approximate potential of equation ( [ mond ] ) in cylindrical coordinates @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the direction of @xmath5 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in the asymptotic newtonian limit @xmath32 @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 . in the non - newtonian limit , which we call the mond limit , @xmath36 , @xmath37",
    "it is to be noted that equation ( [ pot ] ) is not a consequence of tidal effects , since the external field is constant ( @xcite 1984 ) .",
    "we study the orbit of a very small mass @xmath3 such that it does not modify the potential in equation ( [ pot ] ) and consider the motion of @xmath38 , bounded by this potential .",
    "this is a central force type problem , so that conservation of linear momentum implies that the coordinate dependence of the hamiltonian is in the relative distance between @xmath4 and @xmath39 according to equation ( [ pot ] ) , and considering the azimuthal symmetry of the potential , the dynamics of the @xmath40 system are governed by the conservative hamiltonian @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the reduced mass and @xmath43 is the angular momentum component in the direction of @xmath5 ( the direction joining the neighboring massive galaxy and the dwarf galaxy ) .",
    "thus , the three dimensional motion in a axisymmetric potential is reduced to the motion in a plane . in equations ( [ h ] ) and ( [ lbd ] ) , cartesian coordinates @xmath44 are used to describe this ( non - uniformly ) rotating plane , which is often called the meridional plane .    in the mond limit , when @xmath36 , equation ( [ pot ] ) with the condition @xmath26 , yields a minimum distance between @xmath4 and @xmath38 : @xmath45 where the values for @xmath46 and @xmath47 are obtained from equations ( [ ml1])- ( [ ml3 ] ) .",
    "we note that the forces in the @xmath9 and @xmath28 directions are not equal .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) has an elliptic equilibrium position at @xmath48 , @xmath49 , which is called the guiding center . expanding the hamiltonian in a power series about the guiding center",
    ", we have @xmath50 this expansion is called the epicycle approximation and is appropriate in the neighborhood of the equilibrium .",
    "@xmath51 is the unperturbed motion and describes the epicycles around the guiding center ; the two frequencies @xmath52 and @xmath53 given in equation ( [ freq ] ) , are called the epicycle frequency and the vertical frequency , respectively . in phase space ,",
    "the conservation integrals define a @xmath54-dimensional torus . when @xmath55 for integers @xmath56 , the linearized frequencies are said to satisfy a resonance of order @xmath57 .",
    "the corresponding torus is called a resonant torus . from equations ( [ ml3 ] ) and ( [ freq ] ) ,",
    "the allowed linearized resonances are restricted to @xmath58 .    for a resonance of order @xmath57 , it is possible to put the hamiltonian into a birkhoff normal form of degree @xmath57 by a canonical transformation @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a polynomial of degree @xmath57 in the new actions @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the new angles @xcite .",

    "the theorem , known as kam in recognition of their work , states the existence of invariant tori , densely filled with phase space curves winding around them , which are conditionally - periodic with the number of independent frequencies equal to the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this theorem is valid if the following condition holds @xmath67 in equation ( [ nr ] ) @xmath68 is dependent on the magnitude of the perturbation and @xmath69 , on the number of degrees of freedom .",
