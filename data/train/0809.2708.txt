    "one of the basic tasks of modern high energy physics is the study of the fundamental theory of strong interaction ( quantum chromodynamics , qcd ) in new , unexplored extreme regimes of super - high densities and temperatures through the investigation of the properties of hot and dense multi - parton and multi - hadron systems produced in high - energy nuclear collisions  @xcite . indeed , qcd is not just a quantum field theory with an extremely rich dynamical content ( such as asymptotic freedom , chiral symmetry , non - trivial vacuum topology , strong cp violation problem , colour superconductivity ) , but perhaps the only sector of the standard model , where the basic features ( as phase diagram , phase transitions , thermalisation of fundamental fields ) may be the subject to scrutiny in the laboratory .",
    "the experimental and phenomenological study of multi - particle production in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions  @xcite is expected to provide valuable information on the dynamical behaviour of qcd matter in the form of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , as predicted by lattice calculations .",
    "experimental data , obtained from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at maximum beam energy in the center of mass system of colliding ions @xmath12 gev per nucleon pair , supports the picture of formation of a strongly interacting hot qcd matter ( `` quark - gluon fluid '' ) in the most central au+au ( and likely cu+cu ) collisions  @xcite .",
    "this appears as significant modification of properties of multi - particle production in heavy ion collisions as compared with the corresponding proton - proton ( or peripheral heavy ion ) interactions . in particular , one of the important perturbative ( `` hard '' ) probes of qgp",
    "is the medium - induced energy loss of energetic partons , so called `` jet quenching ''  @xcite , which is predicted to be very different in cold nuclear matter and in qgp , and leads to a number of phenomena which are already seen in the rhic data on the qualitative level , such as suppression of high-@xmath7 hadron production , modification of azimuthal back - to - back correlations , azimuthal anisotropy of hadron spectra at high p@xmath8 , etc .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , one of the most spectacular features of low transverse momentum ( `` soft '' ) hadroproduction at rhic",
    "are strong collective flow effects : the radial flow ( ordering of the mean transverse momentum of hadron species with corresponding mass ) and the elliptic flow ( mass - ordered azimuthal anisotropy of particle yields with respect to the reaction plane in non - central collisions ) .",
    "the development of such a strong flow is well described by the hydrodynamic models and requires short time scale and large pressure gradients , attributed to strongly interacting systems  @xcite .",
    "note however , that results of hydrodynamic models usually disagree with the data on femtoscopic momentum correlations , resulting from the space - time characteristics of the system at freeze - out stage .    the heavy ion collision energy in large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern a factor of @xmath18 larger then that in rhic , thereby allows one to probe new frontiers of super - high temperature and ( almost ) net - baryon free qcd  @xcite .",
    "the emphasis of the lhc heavy ion data analysis ( at @xmath19 tev per nucleon pair for lead beams ) will be on the perturbative , or hard probes of the qgp ( quarkonia , jets , photons , high - p@xmath8 hadrons ) as well as on the global event properties , or soft probes ( collective radial and elliptic flow effects , hadron multiplicity , transverse energy densities and femtoscopic momentum correlations ) .",
    "it is expected that at lhc energies the role of hard and semi - hard particle production will be significant even for the bulk properties of created matter .",
    "another domain of qcd phase diagram is high baryon density region , which can be probed in the future experimental studies at relatively moderate heavy ion beam energies @xmath14 gev per nucleon pair ( projects cbm  @xcite and mpd  @xcite at accelerator facilities fair - gsi and nica - jinr , programs for heavy ion runs with lower beam energies at sps and rhic ) .",
    "these studies are motivated by the intention to search for the `` critical point '' of the quark - hadron phase transition , predicted by lattice qcd , where the type of transition is changing from smooth `` crossover '' ( at high temperatures and low net - baryon densities ) to first order transition ( at high net - baryon densities and low temperatures )  @xcite .",
    "ongoing and future experimental studies of relativistic heavy ion collisions in a wide range of beam energies require the development of new monte - carlo ( mc ) event generators and improvement of existing ones . especially for experiments which will be conducted at lhc , due to very high parton and hadron multiplicities",
    ", one needs fast ( but realistic ) mc tools for heavy ion event simulation  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of mc technique for the simulation of high - multiplicity hadroproduction is that it allows a visual comparison of theory and data , including if necessary the detailed detector acceptances , responses and resolutions .",
    "a realistic mc event generator should include a maximum possible number of observable physical effects which are important to determine the event topology : from the bulk properties of soft hadroproduction ( domain of low transverse momenta @xmath5gev@xmath6 ) such as collective flows , to hard multi - parton production in hot and dense qcd - matter , which reveals itself in the spectra of high-@xmath7 particles and hadronic jets .",
    "in most of the available mc heavy ion event generators , the simultaneous treatment of collective flow effects for soft hadroproduction and hard multi - parton in - medium production is absent .",
    "for example , the popular mc model hijing  @xcite includes jet production and jet quenching on some level , but it does not include any significant flow effects .",
    "the recently developed mc model jewel  @xcite , which combines a perturbative final state parton shower with qcd - medium effects , is actually not a heavy ion event generator , but rather a simulator of jet quenching in individual nucleon - nucleon sub - collisions ( like pyquen  @xcite ) .",
    "the event generators fritiof  @xcite and luciae  @xcite include jet production ( but without jet quenching ) , while some collective nuclear effects ( such as string interactions and hadron rescatterings ) are taken into account in luciae .",
    "another mc model therminator  @xcite includes detailed statistical description of `` thermal '' soft particle production and can reproduce the main bulk features of hadron spectra at rhic ( in particular , describe simultaneously the momentum - space measurements and the freeze - out coordinate - space data ) , but it does not include hard parton production processes . there is a number of microscopic transport hadron models ( urqmd  @xcite , qgsm  @xcite , ampt  @xcite , etc . ) , which attempt to analyze the soft particle production in a wide energy range , however they also do not include in - medium production of high-@xmath7 multi - parton states .",
    "moreover , hadronic cascade models have difficulties with the detailed description of relatively low-@xmath7 rhic data on elliptic flow and the size of hadron emission , obtained from momentum correlation measurements ( e.g. ampt can reproduce the elliptic flow or the correlation radii using different sets of model parameters ) . another heavy ion event generator , zpc  @xcite , has been created to simulate parton cascade evolution in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions . from a physical point of view , such an approach seems reasonable only for very high beam energies ( rhic , lhc ) .",
    "note also that the full treatment of parton cascades requires enormous amount of cpu run time ( especially for lhc ) .",
    "thus , in order to analyze existing data on low and high - p@xmath8 hadron production , test the sensitivity of physical observables at the upcoming lhc experiments ( and other future heavy ion facilities ) to the qcd - matter formation , and study the experimental capabilities of constructed detectors , the development of adequate and fast mc models for simultaneous collective flow and jet quenching simulation is necessary .",
    "hydjet++ event generator includes detailed treatment of soft hadroproduction as well as hard multi - parton production , and takes into account medium - induced parton rescattering and energy loss .",
    "although the model is optimized for very high energies of colliding nuclei ( rhic , lhc ) , in practice it can also be used for studying the multi - particle production at lower energies at other heavy ion experimental facilities as fair and nica . moving from very high to moderately high energies , the contribution of the hard part of the event becames smaller , while the soft part turns into just a multi - parameter fit to the data .",
    "the heavy ion event in hydjet++ is the superposition of two independent parts : the soft , hydro - type state and the hard state resulting from multi - parton fragmentation .",
    "note that a conceptually similar approximation has been developed in  @xcite but , to our best knowledge , it is not implemented as an mc event generator .",
    "the main program of hydjet++ is written in the object - oriented c++ language under the root environment  @xcite .",
    "the hard part of hydjet++ is identical to the hard part of fortran - written hydjet ( version 1.5 ) and it is included in the generator structure as a separate directory .",
    "the soft part of hydjet++ event is the `` thermal '' hadronic state generated on the chemical and thermal freeze - out hypersurfaces obtained from a parameterization of relativistic hydrodynamics with preset freeze - out conditions .",
    "it includes the longitudinal , radial and elliptic flow effects and the decays of hadronic resonances . the corresponding fast mc simulation procedure based on c++ code , fast mc  @xcite ,",
    "was adapted to hydjet++ .",
    "the high generation speed in fast mc is achieved due to almost 100% generation efficiency because of nearly uniform residual invariant weights which appear in the freeze - out momentum and coordinate simulation .",
    "let us indicate some physical restrictions of the model .",
    "hydjet++ is only applicable for symmetric aa collisions of heavy ( a @xmath15 ) ions at high energies ( @xmath16 gev ) . since the hydro - type approximation for heavy ion collisions",
    "is considered to be valid for central and semi - central collisions , the results obtained for very peripheral collisions ( with impact parameter of the order of two nucleus radii , @xmath17 ) may be not adequate . nor do we expect a correct event description in the region of very forward rapidities , where the other mechanisms of particle production , apart from hydro - flow and jets , may be important .",
    "a heavy ion event in hydjet++ is a superposition of the soft , hydro - type state and the hard state resulting from multi - parton fragmentation .",
    "both states are treated independently .",
    "the model for the hard multi - parton part of hydjet++ event is the same as that for hydjet event generator .",
    "a detailed description of the physics framework of this model can be found in the corresponding paper  @xcite .",
    "the approach to the description of multiple scattering of hard partons in the dense qcd - matter ( such as quark - gluon plasma ) is based on the accumulative energy loss via the gluon radiation being associated with each parton scattering in the expanding quark - gluon fluid and includes the interference effect ( qcd analog  @xcite of the well known landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect in qed  @xcite for the emission of gluons with a finite formation time ) using the modified radiation spectrum @xmath20 as a function of decreasing temperature @xmath21 . the basic kinetic integral equation for the energy loss @xmath22 as a function of initial energy @xmath23 and path length @xmath24 has the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the current transverse coordinate of a parton",
    ", @xmath27 is the scattering probability density , @xmath20 is the energy loss per unit length , @xmath28 is the in - medium mean free path , @xmath29 is the medium density at the temperature @xmath21 , @xmath30 is the integral cross section for the parton interaction in the medium .",
    "both collisional and radiative energy loss are taken into account in the model .",
    "the partonic collisional energy loss due to elastic scatterings is treated in high - momentum transfer limit  @xcite : @xmath31 where the dominant contribution to the differential scattering cross section is @xmath32 for the scattering of a hard parton with energy @xmath23 and mass @xmath33 off the `` thermal '' parton with energy ( or effective mass ) @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 for @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 scatterings respectively , @xmath39 is the qcd running coupling constant for @xmath40 active quark flavors , and @xmath41 is the qcd scale parameter which is of the order of the critical temperature of quark - hadron phase transition , @xmath42 mev . the integrated cross section @xmath30 is regularized by the debye screening mass squared @xmath43 . the maximum momentum transfer @xmath44 [ s-(m_p - m_0)^2 ] / s$ ] where @xmath45 .",
    "the model simplification is that the collisional energy loss due to scatterings with low momentum transfer ( resulting mainly from the interactions with plasma collective modes or colour background fields , see for recent developments  @xcite and references therein ) is not considered here .",
    "note , however , that in the majority of estimations , the latter process does not contribute much to the total collisional loss in comparison with the high - momentum scattering ( due to absence of the large factor @xmath46 ) , and in numerical computations it can be effectively `` absorbed '' by means of redefinition of minimum momentum transfer @xmath47 in ( [ col ] ) .",
    "another model assumption is that the collisional loss represents the incoherent sum over all scatterings , although it was argued recently in  @xcite that interference effects may appear in elastic parton energy loss in a medium of finite size .",
    "the partonic radiative energy loss is treated in the frameworks of bdms formalism  @xcite .",
    "in fact , there are several calculations of the inclusive energy distribution of medium - induced gluon radiation using feyman multiple scattering diagrams .",
    "the detailed discussions on the relation between these approaches , their basic parameters and physics predictions can be found in the recent proceedings of cern th workshops ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . in the bdms approach , the strength of multiple scattering is characterized by the transport coefficient @xmath48 ( @xmath49 is the gluon mean free path ) , which is related to the elastic scattering cross section @xmath30 in ( [ sigt ] ) . in our simulations",
    "this strength is regulated mainly by the initial qgp temperature @xmath50",
    ". then the energy spectrum of coherent medium - induced gluon radiation and the corresponding dominant part of radiative energy loss of massless parton become  @xcite : @xmath51   \\>\\ln{\\left| \\cos{(\\omega_1\\tau_1 ) } \\right| }   \\ > , \\\\    \\omega_1 = \\sqrt{i \\left ( 1 - y + \\frac{c_r}{3}y^2 \\right )     \\bar{\\kappa}\\ln{\\frac{16}{\\bar{\\kappa } } } } \\quad \\mbox{with}\\quad   \\bar{\\kappa } = \\frac{\\mu_d^2\\lambda_g   } { \\omega(1-y ) } ~ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the fraction of the hard parton energy carried away by the radiated gluon , and @xmath54 is the quark color factor .",
    "a similar expression for the gluon jet can be obtained by setting @xmath55 and properly changing the factor in the square brackets in ( [ radiat ] )  @xcite .",
    "the integration ( [ radiat ] ) is carried out over all energies from @xmath56 , the minimum radiated gluon energy in the coherent lpm regime , up to initial parton energy @xmath23 .",
    "note that we do not consider here possible effects of double parton scattering  @xcite and thermal gluon absorption  @xcite , which can be included in the model in the future .",
    "the simplest generalization of the formula ( [ radiat ] ) for a heavy quark of mass @xmath57 can be done by using the `` dead - cone '' approximation  @xcite : @xmath58 one should mention a number of more recent developments in heavy quark energy loss calculations available in the literature ( see  @xcite and references therein ) , which can be included in the model in the future .",
    "the medium where partonic rescattering occurs is treated as a boost - invariant longitudinally expanding quark - gluon fluid , and the partons as being produced on a hyper - surface of equal proper times @xmath59  @xcite . in order to simplify numerical calculations",
    "we omit here the transverse expansion and viscosity of the fluid using the well - known scaling solution obtained by bjorken  @xcite for a temperature @xmath21 and energy density @xmath60 of qgp at @xmath61 mev : @xmath62 the proper time @xmath63 of qgp formation , the initial qgp temperature @xmath50 at mid - rapidity ( @xmath64 ) for central ( impact parameter @xmath65 ) pb+pb collisions , and the number @xmath40 of active flavours are input model parameters . for non - central collisions and for other beam atomic numbers ,",
    "@xmath50 is calculated automatically : the initial energy density @xmath66 is supposed to be proportional to the ratio of nuclear overlap function @xmath67 to effective transverse area of nuclear overlapping @xmath68  @xcite : @xmath69 where @xmath70 are the distances between the centres of colliding nuclei and the jet production vertex @xmath71 ( @xmath72 being the distance from the nuclear collision axis to v ) , @xmath73 is the transverse distance from the nuclear collision axis to the effective boundary of nuclear overlapping area in the given azimuthal direction @xmath74 ( so that @xmath75 is equal to the nuclear radius @xmath76 ) , @xmath77 is the nuclear thickness functions , and @xmath78 is the standard woods - saxon nucleon density distribution  @xcite ( see @xcite for detailed nuclear geometry explanations ) .",
    "the rapidity dependent spreading of the initial energy density around mid - rapidity @xmath64 is taken in the gaussian - like form .",
    "the radial profile of the energy density ( or the temperature ) is also introduced in the parton rescattering model .",
    "the transverse energy density in each point inside the nuclear overlapping zone is proportional to the impact - parameter dependent product of two nuclear thickness functions @xmath79 in this point : @xmath80 thus , in fact , the input parameter @xmath81 acquires the meaning of an effective ( i.e. averaged over the whole nuclear overlapping region ) initial temperature in central pb+pb collisions .",
    "note that the other scenarios of qgp space - time evolution for the mc implementation of the model were also studied .",
    "in particular , the influence of the transverse flow , as well as that of the mixed phase at @xmath82 , on the intensity of jet rescattering ( which is a strongly increasing function of @xmath21 ) has been found to be inessential for high initial temperatures @xmath83 . on the contrary , the presence of qgp viscosity slows down the cooling rate , that implies a jet parton spending more time in the hottest regions of the medium . as a result the rescattering intensity increases , i.e. , in fact the effective temperature of the medium appears to be higher as compared with the perfect qgp case .",
    "we also do not take into account here the probability of jet rescattering in the nuclear matter , because the intensity of this process and the corresponding contribution to the total energy loss are not significant due to much smaller energy density in a `` cold '' nucleus .",
    "another important element of the model is the angular spectrum of in - medium gluon radiation .",
    "since the detailed calculation of the angular spectrum of emitted gluons is rather sophisticated , the simple `` small - angle '' parameterization of the gluon distribution over the emission angle @xmath84 was used : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the typical angle of the coherent gluon radiation as estimated in  @xcite .",
    "two other parameterizations ( `` wide - angle '' @xmath87 , and `` collinear '' @xmath88 ) are also envisaged .    the model for single hard nucleon - nucleon sub - collision pyquen  @xcite was constructed as a modification of the jet event obtained with the generator of hadron - hadron interactions pythia@xmath96.4  @xcite .",
    "the event - by - event simulation procedure in pyquen includes generation of the initial parton spectra with pythia and production vertexes at given impact parameter , rescattering - by - rescattering simulation of the parton path in a dense zone , radiative and collisional energy loss per rescattering , final hadronization with the lund string model for hard partons and in - medium emitted gluons .",
    "then the pyquen multi - jets generated according to the binomial distribution are included in the hard part of the event .",
    "if there is no nuclear shadowing , the mean number of jets produced in aa events at a given impact parameter @xmath89 is proportional to the mean number of binary nn sub - collisions , @xmath90 . in the presence of shadowing , this number is determined as @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 , calculated with pythia , are the total inelastic non - diffractive nn cross section and the differential cross section of the corresponding hard process in @xmath10 collisions ( at the same c.m.s .",
    "energy , @xmath94 , of colliding beams ) with the minimum transverse momentum transfer @xmath11 respectively .",
    "the latter is another input parameter of the model . in the hydjet frameworks , partons produced in ( semi)hard processes with the momentum transfer lower than @xmath11",
    "are considered as being `` thermalized '' , so their hadronization products are included in the soft part of the event `` automatically '' .",
    "the factor @xmath95 in ( [ numjets ] ) takes into account the effect of nuclear shadowing on parton distribution functions .",
    "it can be written as a product of shadowing factors for both the colliding nuclei as @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the ratio of nuclear to nucleon parton distribution functions ( normalized by the atomic number ) for the parton of type @xmath98 ( light quark or gluon ) , @xmath99 are the momentum fractions of the initial partons from the incoming nuclei which participate in the hard scattering characterized by the scale @xmath100 , and @xmath101 are the transverse coordinates of the partons in their respective nuclei , so that @xmath102 . in hydjet++ ,",
    "nuclear shadowing corrections are implemented not by modifying the parton showering of single nn collisions in pythia but by correcting of the contribution of initial coherent , multiple scattering in effective way .",
    "in fact , this nuclear effect reduces the number of partons in the incoming hadronic wave - function of both the nuclei and thus reduces the total jet production cross section .",
    "since the degree of this reduction depends on the kinematic variables of incoming hard partons , both initial and final parton momentum spectra are modified as a result of nuclear shadowing .",
    "the shadowing corrections are expected to be very significant at lhc energies , where both soft and relatively high-@xmath7 ( @xmath103 gev/@xmath104 ) particle production probe the low-@xmath105 gluon distribution of the target at moderate scales , @xmath106 , and are therefore strongly influenced by unitarity effects . in the glauber - gribov theory  @xcite , this phenomenon arises from coherent interaction of the projectile fluctuation on the target constituents and is closely related to the diffractive structure function of the nucleon . due to the factorization theorem for hard processes in qcd",
    ", @xmath107 describes the modifications of nuclear parton distribution functions ( i.e. distributions of quarks and gluons in nuclei ) , such that @xmath108 from summation of pomeron fan diagrams the shadowing factor is found to be @xmath109 , where the effective cross section for quarks and gluon , respectively , is found to be @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 denote the quark - singlet and gluon diffractive parton distribution functions , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the normal parton distribution functions , @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the slope of diffractive distribution and the pomeron flux factor respectively , @xmath117 is the nuclear form factor .",
    "the quark and gluon diffractive distributions are taken from the most recent experimental parameterizations by the h1 collaboration  @xcite , and the resulting shadowing factors calculated in  @xcite are implemented in hydjet and hydjet++ .",
    "the soft part of hydjet++ event is the `` thermal '' hadronic state generated on the chemical and thermal freeze - out hypersurfaces obtained from a parameterization of relativistic hydrodynamics with preset freeze - out conditions .",
    "the detailed description of the physics frameworks of this model can be found in the corresponding papers  @xcite .",

    "<S> ongoing and future experimental studies in a wide range of heavy ion beam energies require the development of new monte - carlo ( mc ) event generators and improvement of existing ones . especially for experiments at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , implying very high parton and hadron multiplicities </S>",
    "<S> , one needs fast ( but realistic ) mc tools for heavy ion event simulations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main advantage of mc technique for the simulation of high - multiplicity hadroproduction is that it allows a visual comparison of theory and data , including if necessary the detailed detector acceptances , responses and resolutions . </S>",
    "<S> the realistic mc event generator has to include maximum possible number of observable physical effects , which are important to determine the event topology : from the bulk properties of soft hadroproduction ( domain of low transverse momenta @xmath5gev@xmath6 ) such as collective flows , to hard multi - parton production in hot and dense qcd - matter , which reveals itself in the spectra of high-@xmath7 particles and hadronic jets . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the role of hard and semi - hard particle production at lhc can be significant even for the bulk properties of created matter , and hard probes of qgp became clearly observable in various new channels  @xcite . in majority of the available mc heavy ion event generators , the simultaneous treatment of collective flow effects for soft hadroproduction and hard multi - parton in - medium production ( medium - induced partonic rescattering and energy loss , so called `` jet quenching '' ) </S>",
    "<S> is lacking . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in order to analyze existing data on low and high - p@xmath8 hadron production , test the sensitivity of physical observables at the upcoming lhc experiments ( and other future heavy ion facilities ) to the qgp formation , and study the experimental capabilities of constructed detectors , the development of adequate and fast mc models for simultaneous collective flow and jet quenching simulations is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> hydjet++ event generator includes detailed treatment of soft hadroproduction as well as hard multi - parton production , and takes into account known medium effects .    </S>",
    "<S> _ solution method : _ </S>",
    "<S> + a heavy ion event in hydjet++ is a superposition of the soft , hydro - type state and the hard state resulting from multi - parton fragmentation . </S>",
    "<S> both states are treated independently . </S>",
    "<S> hydjet++ is the development and continuation of hydjet mc model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main program is written in the object - oriented c++ language under the root environment  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hard part of hydjet++ is identical to the hard part of fortran - written hydjet  @xcite ( version 1.5 ) and is included in the generator structure as a separate directory . </S>",
    "<S> the routine for generation of single hard nn collision , generator pyquen @xcite , modifies the `` standard '' jet event obtained with the generator pythia@xmath96.4  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the event - by - event simulation procedure in pyquen includes _ 1 ) _ generation of initial parton spectra with pythia and production vertexes at given impact parameter ; _ 2 ) _ rescattering - by - rescattering simulation of the parton path in a dense zone and its radiative and collisional energy loss ; _ 3 ) _ final hadronization according to the lund string model for hard partons and in - medium emitted gluons . then the pyquen multi - jets generated according to the binomial distribution are included in the hard part of the event . </S>",
    "<S> the mean number of jets produced in an aa event is the product of the number of binary nn sub - collisions at a given impact parameter and the integral cross section of the hard process in @xmath10 collisions with the minimum transverse momentum transfer @xmath11 . in order to take into account the effect of nuclear shadowing on parton distribution functions , the impact parameter dependent parameterization obtained in the framework of glauber - gribov theory  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> is used . </S>",
    "<S> the soft part of hydjet++ event is the `` thermal '' hadronic state generated on the chemical and thermal freeze - out hypersurfaces obtained from the parameterization of relativistic hydrodynamics with preset freeze - out conditions ( the adapted c++ code fast mc  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> hadron multiplicities are calculated using the effective thermal volume approximation and poisson multiplicity distribution around its mean value , which is supposed to be proportional to the number of participating nucleons at a given impact parameter of aa collision . </S>",
    "<S> the fast soft hadron simulation procedure includes _ 1 ) _ generation of the 4-momentum of a hadron in the rest frame of a liquid element in accordance with the equilibrium distribution function ; _ 2 ) _ generation of the spatial position of a liquid element and its local 4-velocity in accordance with phase space and the character of motion of the fluid ; _ 3 ) _ the standard von neumann rejection / acceptance procedure to account for the difference between the true and generated probabilities ; _ 4 ) _ boost of the hadron 4-momentum in the center mass frame of the event ; _ 5 ) _ the two- and three - body decays of resonances with branching ratios taken from the share particle decay table  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the high generation speed in hydjet++ is achieved due to almost 100% generation efficiency of the `` soft '' part because of the nearly uniform residual invariant weights which appear in the freeze - out momentum and coordinate simulation . </S>",
    "<S> although hydjet++ is optimized for very high energies of rhic and lhc colliders ( c.m.s . </S>",
    "<S> energies of heavy ion beams @xmath12 and @xmath13 gev per nucleon pair respectively ) , in practice it can also be used for studying the particle production in a wider energy range down to @xmath14 gev per nucleon pair at other heavy ion experimental facilities . </S>",
    "<S> as one moves from very high to moderately high energies , the contribution of the hard part of the event becomes smaller , while the soft part turns into just a multi - parameter fit to the data .    </S>",
    "<S> _ restrictions : _ + hydjet++ is only applicable for symmetric aa collisions of heavy ( a @xmath15 ) ions at high energies ( c.m.s . </S>",
    "<S> energy @xmath16 gev per nucleon pair ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained for very peripheral collisions ( with the impact parameter of the order of two nucleus radii , @xmath17 ) and very forward rapidities may be not adequate .    _ running time : _ + the generation of 100 central ( 0@xmath05% ) au+au events at @xmath1 gev ( pb+pb events at @xmath2 gev ) with default input parameters takes about 7 ( 85 ) minutes on a pc 64 bit intel core duo cpu @ 3 ghz with 8 gb of ram memory under red hat enterprise . </S>",
