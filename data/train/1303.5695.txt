    "the standard model of elementary particle physics has succeeded to partially unify electromagnetic and weak interactions within a consistent , renormalizable framework . however , this is achieved at the price of introducing a new interaction of all massive particles with a scalar field , the higgs field , which is in turn considered to be responsible for the generation of the mass of all elementary particles constituting matter and mediating interactions .",
    "such a dynamical mechanism for generating mass should ultimately confront the other subfield of fundamental physics in which the concept of mass plays a crucial role , namely gravitation .",
    "a first step towards this confrontation has been taken in @xcite , in which the implications of the higgs field in proximity of strong sources of gravity have been discussed in the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes @xcite , leading to the prediction of spectroscopic shifts in principle distinguishable from the usual doppler , gravitational , or cosmological shifts .    in this work ,",
    "we continue our analysis of the higgs interplay with gravitation by describing , still in an elementary fashion , two macroscopic consequences of assuming that the mass of elementary particles is generated by the higgs field .",
    "similar to @xcite , the basic idea is that the properties of the higgs field in flat spacetime are deformed by the presence of masses , and this feeds back on the value of the masses themselves .",
    "if the equivalence principle is assumed to be valid , this will lead to corrections to the usual newton s law of universal gravitation and to violations of the superposition principle .",
    "in particular , in this second case we discuss a potential relationship between such violations and already performed experiments originally aimed at evidencing gravitational screening .",
    "we argue that the possible evidence for a detectable signal from this class of experiments could be interpreted as due to the higgs - mediated influence of surrounding masses , at least if the violation is large enough with respect to the one expected from the nonlinear character of general relativity . in a more general framework ,",
    "empirical evidences for gravitational polarization of matter have been discussed in @xcite , and our work discusses in the standard model setting an effect related to the higgs vacuum which can induce gravitational vacuum polarization phenomena .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we discuss the mass content of a body from the microscopic point of view in the framework of the standard model of elementary particles .",
    "it turns out that , while most of the mass of atoms emerges from qcd vacuum , a nonnegligible part depends instead on the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field . in section 3",
    "this remark is used to show that the mass of a body is affected by the mass of a surrounding body - provided that a non - null coupling between the higgs field and the curvature of spacetime exists .",
    "this implies deviations from the law of universal gravitation for the force exterted between two bodies . in section 4",
    "we discuss a more sensitive way to evidence this effect by evaluating deviations from the superposition principle holding in newtonian gravity . using the same limits as in the previous section , we show that a window of opportunity for the experimental observation ( or to achieve better limits on the higgs - curvature coupling ) is obtained by considering a class of experiments similar to the one pioneered by quirino majorana nearly nine decades ago .",
    "while these experiments were originally motivated by the search for gravitational absorption / shielding , we argue that in our framework they should be considered as the most sensitive to possible changes of inertial and gravitational mass that a test body may experience in the presence of nearby massive objects .",
    "this allows us to sketch , in section 5 , two experimental configurations in which a test mass should be maximally coupled to surrounding masses by using a parallel plane geometry . in the conclusions we summarize our discussions ,",
    "briefly touch the perspectives for generalizations to other extended theories of gravity , and stress their conceptual relevance to the same definition of gravitational potential in a newtonian or post - newtonian setting .",
    "in order to study the interplay between the higgs field and gravitation , the first question we want to answer is the following : how is a macroscopic mass envisioned from the viewpoint of the standard model of elementary particle physics ? at the microscopic level , we will have elementary constituents and their binding energies . by neglecting the mutual gravitational and weak binding energies among the elementary constituents ,",
    "the remaining binding energies originate from the electromagnetic interactions between electrons and nuclei , and from the color interactions among quarks in nucleons .",
    "in addition , there are also subleading contributions from the residuals of the electromagnetic interaction among electrons and nuclei of different atoms ( also called _ van der waals _ forces ) and from the residuals of the color interactions among quarks of different nucleons ( also called _ nuclear _ force ) . unlike quarks and electrons , both photons and gluons",
    "are massless and are not expected to interact with the higgs field at tree level .",
    "the mass of nucleons can be then thought as being composed of a higgs - related mass term , and a term independent on the higgs field .",
    "for instance , assuming mere additivity of the two terms , we may write the masses for protons and neutrons @xmath0 with @xmath1 and @xmath2 being the yukawa couplings of the up and down quarks , @xmath3 the vev of the higgs field , and @xmath4 the mass of the nucleons due to pure gauge interaction of the gluonic fields , with this last component independent upon the vev of the higgs field .",
    "this approximate constituent model of the nucleons can be made more quantitative by assuming for the up and down quarks the mass values @xmath5=2.25 mev / c@xmath6 and @xmath7=5.0 mev / c@xmath6 , respectively . with a vev for the higgs field in flat spacetime @xmath8250 gev",
    "we obtain , in order to fit the proton and neutron masses , @xmath4= 928.05 mev / c@xmath6 .",
    "this shows that , if we assume only valence quarks , their mass is responsible for a small percentage of the nucleon inertia , of order 1@xmath9 , whereas the remaining inertia is entirely due to the gluonic field .",
    "this model could be refined by considering the sea quarks and partonic density functions , and in this case the gluons will be responsible for a smaller ( order of 50@xmath9 ) percentage of inertia , thereby sensibly increasing the percentage of inertia sensitive to the higgs field . in the spirit of giving simple and conservative estimates , in what follows",
    "we will limit our attention to the constituent / valence model .",
    "the mass of a body constituted of @xmath10 atoms , considered for simplicity homogeneously made of an element of atomic number @xmath11 and atomic mass @xmath12 , is therefore @xmath13,\\ ] ] where we have again distinguished between the components ( electrons and quarks ) whose mass linearly depends on the higgs vev through a dimensionless coefficient @xmath14 $ ] , and the ones unrelated to the higgs field .",
    "this mass is the one measured for instance in experiments involving deflection of charged particles in magnetic ( _ i.e. _ non - gravitational ) fields , also called _ inertial _ mass .",
    "we will assume that the galileian equivalence principle holds also at the microscopic level ( see however @xcite for more detailed discussions ) .",
    "this hypothesis implies that also the gravitational charge ( also called _ gravitational _ mass ) follows exactly the same higgs content as its inertial counterpart , and that accurate tests of the equivalence principle will be unable to pinpoint the physics discussed in the next sections .",
    "it is important to realize that in general the vev of the higgs field depends , as for any field , on the spacetime point in which is considered .",
    "this leads , in the presence of a specific coupling between the higgs field and the curvature , to a dependence of the higgs - dependent gravitational masses of the two bodies upon the specific spacetime point in which they are located . by making explicit the higgs - related mass contributions ,",
    "the universal law of gravitation for the amplitude of the force between two homogeneous and spherical bodies spaced by a distance located at positions @xmath15 will be written in terms of their gravitational masses , based on eq .",
    "2 , as @xmath16[\\gamma_2 v(\\vec{r}_2)/c^2+a_2 m_{qcd}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 .",
    "we discuss in the following possible forms of the coupling between the higgs field and the curvature of spacetime .",
    "the simplest coupling is of the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the ricci scalar , @xmath20 the higgs field , and @xmath21 their coupling strength @xcite .",
    "since for spherical masses the ricci scalar in the outer volume is zero , a higgs - curvature coupling like @xmath22 will not generate any change in the higgs vev , ruling out any possible experiment or observation involving symmetrical masses .",
    "a coupling of this form is not experimentally observable unless specific geometries with partial spatial symmetry are considered .",
    "however , there are gravity models in which a scalar field may couple to the metric also through other curvature invariants , for instance the einstein - gauss - bonnet theory which has been introduced as a promising framework to tame ultraviolet divergences in the quantized counterpart of the theory @xcite",
    ". experiments with higher degree of spatial symmetry could be sensitive to the higgs coupling to non - zero curvature scalars such as the kretschmann invariant @xmath23 .",
    "the higgs - kretschmann coupling becomes expressed in terms of a single free parameter if the kretschmann invariant contributes to the lagrangian through its square - root @xmath24 as discussed in a strong - gravity setting ( in proximity of a back - hole ) in @xcite .",
    "this choice could allow us to conjecture a minimalistic scenario , with @xmath25 being the only free parameter , but is is inconsistent since such a lagrangian term gives rise to singularities in the @xmath26 limit as in a weak - gravity scenario discussed here . a linear coupling to the kretschmann invariant",
    "has a consistent weak - gravity limit but requires instead , for dimensional reasons , the presence of a further parameter in the form of a fundamental length .",
    "we then assume , as a natural setting , a lagrangian term of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the planck length , whose value is @xmath29 m in conventional quantum gravity models .",
    "of course , any length obtained by multiplying @xmath30 by a reasonably large number could also play its role , or larger values of @xmath30 such as the one corresponding to models with _ early _ unifications of gravity to the other fundamental interactions @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the planck length occurs at the tev scale via extra dimensions , @xmath31 m. in order to keep an eye open on this arbitrarity , in the following we will consider both these somewhat extreme situations , by evaluating relevant quantities using both values of @xmath30 .    with this assumption",
    ", we can mimic the reasoning in @xcite in which the higgs - curvature term adds to the mass parameter ( introducing explicitly @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) @xmath34 , which corresponds to renormalize the higgs mass term such as @xmath35 , with @xmath36 the compton wavelength corresponding to the higgs mass term , @xmath37 m , choosing @xmath38 gev .    while in flat spacetime and in the spontaneously broken phase the higgs field develops a vev @xmath39 , in the presence of curved spacetime the vev becomes @xmath40 the latter expression being valid in the weakly coupled regime , _",
    "i.e. _ if @xmath41 .",
    "then , by supposing that two masses are present in locations @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the vev in @xmath42 will be affected by the curvature produced by the mass in @xmath43 and vice versa . for the schwarzschild metric",
    "the kretschmann invariant in position @xmath44 due to the @xmath45 mass source is @xmath46 , allowing to write the vev in location @xmath47 as @xmath48 with @xmath49=1,2 , @xmath50 being the schwarzschild radius of the @xmath51 mass .",
    "based on eq .",
    "2 , this allows to write the mass of a body as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the _ bare _ mass in the presence of flat spacetime , _",
    "i.e. _ in the absence of all other @xmath45 mass sources .",
    "the newton s universal law will be consequently written as @xmath54 notice the cross - terms in which the two masses appear simultaneously ( since the schwarzschild radius depends on mass ) , which in principle invalidate the linear dependence of the force on the mass of each body .",
    "also , we will have @xmath55 and @xmath56 distance dependences superimposed to the usual newtonian @xmath57 scaling .",
    "the higgs correction is expected to be extremely small under practical circumstances so that to the next - to - leading order we can keep only the @xmath55 term .",
    "this means that the gravitational force will be written as @xmath58.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming the same atomic composition and , for simplicity , @xmath59 ( isoscalar nuclei ) , this correction is maximal for equal masses @xmath60 , therefore we have @xmath61 where we have defined @xmath62 as the mass fraction of a body sensitive to the higgs field through the yukawa couplings of the elementary constituents , equal to @xmath63 for isoscalar bodies .",
    "if we consider @xmath64=1 kg ( leading to @xmath65 m ) , @xmath66 m , and @xmath67=10 cm , we obtain , for the second term in eq .",
    "10 , the quantity @xmath68 in the usual quantum gravity scenario with @xmath29 m , and @xmath69 if @xmath31 m is instead considered .",
    "if any nonminimal coupling is active , it must give rise to tiny deviations from newtonian gravity , and the fact that the newton gravitational constant is known with a relative precision of @xmath70 gives already upper bounds of @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the two choices of @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "lower bounds on the detectable @xmath73 arise from the leading corrections to the universal law of gravitation due to its nonlinear character and quantum gravity effects .",
    "these have been evaluated in @xcite , and the gravitational force between two bodies is then rewritten as @xmath74.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] plugging in numbers for our case it turns out that the nonlinear term ( the second contribution in the square bracket of the above equation ) dominates over the quantum gravity correction ( the third term linear in @xmath32 ) and represents a correction of @xmath75 with respect to unity , forbidding the observation of effects due to @xmath76 for @xmath29 ( @xmath77 for @xmath31 ) .",
    "the upper bounds of @xmath73 just discussed can be compared to the ones obtainable in dedicated astrophysical surveys near black holes . by repeating the analysis , carried out in @xcite for the case of a square - root kretschmann coupling to the higgs field , relative frequency shifts in the electronic transitions due to a linear coupling to the kretschmann invariant are estimated to be @xmath78 with @xmath79 the electron mass .",
    "for spectroscopic shifts arising from atoms in the innermost stable orbit of a black hole ( @xmath80 ) , this yields @xmath81 . if astrophysical surveys will rule out the presence of anomalous frequency shifts at the @xmath82 level , _",
    "i.e. _ the current instrumental sensitivity limit on ammonia surveys @xcite , one will get , for @xmath83 m , the bound @xmath84 from the analysis of solar black holes , and @xmath85 from the analysis of mini black holes with a mass of @xmath86 kg , still large enough to survive quantum evaporation up to now ( with @xmath87 and @xmath88 if @xmath89 m is instead assumed ) .",
    "a more sensitive framework to constrain possible nonminimal couplings related to the higgs field is provided by experiments in which the superposition principle for newtonian forces is tested .",
    "this allows for the usually more controllable and reproducible environment characteristic of tabletop experiments .",
    "however , there are intrinsic limitations since the superposition principle for gravitational forces is approximately valid only within the linearized , weak - gravity limit , but it is expected to fail if a sufficient degree of precision is achieved , due to the underlying nonlinear character of general relativity . as we will discuss below , this will translate into a lower bound on the minimum detectable value of @xmath73 .",
    "let us consider two bodies 1 and 2 separated by a distance @xmath67 , gravitationally attracting each other in the presence of a third body 3 .",
    "this last is put in proximity of body 2 , at a distance @xmath19 , such that the line passing along 2 and 3 is orthogonal to the line passing along 1 and 2 . in this way",
    "the force component along the direction joining bodies 1 and 2 is not affected by the force exerted between bodies 2 and 3 .",
    "the higgs vacuum polarization will induce a change of the masses , and if we focus on body 2 , the force exerted on it due to body 1 will change by an amount @xmath90 the relative force change is therefore , in the weak limit @xmath91 this implies a violation of the superposition principle linear in the coefficient @xmath73 , independent upon the distance between the two bodies 1 and 2 and , as before , depending on the percentage of the higgs - related mass in a nucleon . by considering again an element with @xmath59 , and a mass @xmath92=1 kg at a distance of 10 cm , we obtain @xmath93 . even in this case",
    "the expected shift is minute unless large values of @xmath73 are assumed .",
    "this has to be confronted with the deviation from the superposition principle expected in post - newtonian parameterizations of general relativity . in the configuration discussed above",
    ", this becomes @xcite @xmath94 therefore , we have genuine general relativity corrections directly proportional to @xmath95 .",
    "in the same example discussed above , this leads to force shifts @xmath96 , and then values of @xmath97 can not be discriminated from this background due to general relativity corrections .    among precision experiments able to further constraint nonminimal coupling coefficients ,",
    "it is worth to point out that quirino majorana nine decades ago @xcite ( see also @xcite for former attempts ) provided tests of the superposition principle for gravitational forces , with a dynamical version of the experiment being subsequently performed at about the same level of precision @xcite .",
    "more specifically , in majorana s experiments a reduction of the weight of a spherical mass symmetrically surrounded by another mass in close proximity was observed at the @xmath98 level . in a first series of experiments using a 1.274 kg mass of lead surrounded by 115 kg of mercury , majorana observed a decrease in weight of @xmath99 kg @xcite corresponding to a relative decrease of @xmath100 . in a second version of the experiment he surrounded the same lead mass with 9,603 kg of lead , obtaining a decrease in weight of @xmath101 kg @xcite , translating into a relative decrease of @xmath102 .",
    "majorana interpreted these results in the framework of gravitational screening , obtaining in the first class of experiments with mercury a gravitational permeability coefficient about twice bigger than the one obtained in the second class .",
    "objections to this interpretation soon arose , with current stronger limits coming from the study of solar eclipses and tides @xcite ( see also @xcite for a discussion of shielding of dynamical gravitational fields such as gravitational waves ) .",
    "an alternative view in which the observed effect is due to a mass reduction coming from proximity masses was suggested in ref .",
    "incidentally , in this view the larger effectiveness , relatively to the involved masses , in decreasing the weight of the lead mass by the mercury mass with respect to the more massive lead mass could be tentatively justified due to the closeness of the former mass to the lead sphere , as it seems corroborated by a detailed scrutiny of the experimental setup drawings reported in majorana s papers @xcite . in our setting , by rejecting the hypothesis that mass shifts were effectively observed , and claiming that the superposition principle is valid at the @xmath98 accuracy level implies , based on eq .",
    "13 , an upper bound on the kretschmann coupling @xmath103 .",
    "lll & @xmath83 m & @xmath89 m + ( a ) 2-body gravitational force & @xmath104 & @xmath105 + ( b ) 3-body superposition test & @xmath106 & @xmath107 + ( c ) higgs - shifts 1 m@xmath108 bh & @xmath109 & @xmath110 + ( d ) higgs - shifts mini - bh & @xmath111 & @xmath112 +    more recent experiments such as the one described in @xcite , while yielding stronger limits on gravitational absorption than the majorana s ones as discussed in @xcite , do not necessarily correspond to stronger constraints on the influence of surrounding masses as the test mass and the surrounding bodies were significantly more spaced apart than in majorana s experiments , with a similar relative precision for mass measurements .",
    "experiments using rotating torsional balances as in @xcite designed for test of the equivalence principle would be extremely sensitive to possible differences induced by the higgs field between inertial and gravitational mass , assumed in this paper to be rigorously proportional to each other . however , they are not sensitive enough to look for the influence of surrounding bodies on the gravitational force , as shown by the fact that the upper limit on other than purely gravitational force for an yukawa interaction range of order of meters is of the order of @xmath113 with respect to newtonial gravity .    finally , we summarize in table 1 the discussion on the four possible methods to provide upper bounds to the parameter @xmath73 .",
    "astrophysical surveys in principle provide a better leverage towards limiting this parameter , but we believe that improvements by some orders of magnitude could be achieved with dedicated tabletop experiments , as we will briefly suggest in the following section .",
    "dedicated configurations in which violations to the superposition principle for gravitational forces could be evidenced or ruled out at the highest level of precision may be designed .",
    "since we expect the sought effect to be proportional to the surface - to - mass ratio , the basic idea behind these optimized configurations is to take into account the geometrical shape of a body , and use slabs instead of the usual spherical geometry .",
    "two different configurations can be envisaged to find out or give upper bounds to a possible kretschmann coupling between the higgs field and gravitation .",
    "one consists in using a cavendish balance with test masses designed as plates , for instance of a rectangular shape rather than the usual spherical shape ( fig .",
    "two plates are also added on each side of the test mass in a parallel plate configuration , at approximately the same distance to compensate for the added gravitational force .",
    "the requirements on the distance are not stringent since the gravitational force between parallel plates is independent on distance , apart from border effects . in this configuration",
    "the plates lie along the vertical axis , in order to cancel any contribution due to the earth s gravitational field .",
    "this closely resembles the scheme proposed in @xcite for the study of submillimeter short - range non - newtonian components of the gravitational force .",
    "the second scheme , more in the spirit of majorana s experiments , could alternatively exploit the earth as a source of the gravitational field , with a highly sensitive balance and test masses still of planar shape but now lying along the horizontal plane ( fig .",
    "1b ) . in both cases ,",
    "the force between the gravitational _ source _ and the _ test _ mass should be monitored in the absence ( _ i.e. _ , at distance large enough ) and in the presence of the two parallel plates inserted on the opposite sides of the test mass plate .",
    "also , spurious signals due to the deviations of the gravitational field due to the finite size of the plates ( analogous to the deviations of the electric fields for finite size configurations studied in @xcite ) and from electric forces due to patch effects ( in the case of conducting surfaces , see in particular @xcite ) or localized charges ( in the case of insulating surfaces ) must be carefully modeled before claiming a positive signal due to the kretschmann coupling of the higgs field to the metric ( see also @xcite for a recent general discussion of systematic effects in casimir force experiments ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have discussed gravitational vacuum polarization effects induced by the higgs field , which imply distinctive changes in newton s gravitational law and the superposition principle for gravitational forces . even considering the current precision level in the determination of the universal gravitational constant @xmath114 @xcite , a direct measurement of deviations from newton s law is experimentally precluded .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that experiments aimed at evidencing deviations from the superposition principle using modern balance techniques are feasible and could shed light on possible nonminimal couplings between the higgs ( or a higgs - like field ) and spacetime , complementary or in alternative to dedicated astrophysical surveys as suggested in @xcite . we have also discussed explicit experimental configurations which seem the most promising to evidence the presence of gravitational effects due to proximity masses .",
    "the phenomenological platform has been developed assuming a linear coupling of the higgs field to the kretschmann invariant , however other forms of coupling could be considered , as for instance the scalar of @xmath115curvature @xmath116 or the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xcite in the framework of the recently proposed hoava - lifshifts gravity @xcite .",
    "an even more general scenario left open in this analysis is the one in which the higgs field couples also to invariants related to torsion .",
    "for @xmath117-gravity models , this has intriguing implications as it naturally leads to weak - like , chiral interactions acting at an energy scale close or coincident with the fermi scale @xcite , paving the road to a possible unification of gravitation and weak interactions .",
    "while a comprehensive analysis of phenomenological bounds on curvature - torsion models is beyond the scope of this paper , this shows again that our discussion relative to a specific , model - dependent higgs - curvature coupling through the kretschmann invariant provides an operative setting in which extensions of general relativity may confront possible experiments / observations .",
    "although partially related to our consideration , we mention recent work discussing the possible mass shifts of heavy elementary particles due to a higgs self - polarization phenomenon , supposed to be observable near pair production threshold at high energy accelerators , most notably for the top quark @xcite .    any possible matching between quantum vacuum and gravitation has been so far frustrated by the difficulty for successful experimental observation of predicted effects , as in the well - known example of hawking radiation , due to the combined smallness of the universal constant of gravitation and planck s constant , and the discussion in this work confirms this state of affairs in terms of experimental observability of the investigated effects .",
    "it is at least comforting to point out that , at a more conceptual level , our findings also show a conflict between higgs field physics and the notion that gravitational potentials , as assumed in newtonian gravitation or in post - newtonian parameterizations of metric theories , are meaningful concepts to describe gravity in their non - relativistic limit , providing a further source of concern for any future hypothetical unification between quantum physics and gravitation .",
