    "the spectral problem for possible sums of two random hermitian matrices with given spectra had been a long - standing problem , formulated as horn s conjecture , until it was completely solved only recently by klyachko , knutson and tao ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in @xcite , klyachko then observed a close connection between @xmath0-biinvariant random walks on @xmath1 and random walks on the additive group @xmath2 of all hermitian @xmath3-matrices with trace 0 whose transition probabilities are conjugation - invariant under @xmath0 .",
    "he used this connection to reduce the description of the possible singular spectra of products of random matrices from @xmath1 with given singular spectra to the spectral problem for sums of hermitian matrices . basically , klyachko s observation is a connection between the convolution algebras of the gelfand pairs @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "it is closely related to a similar correspondence between the convolutions of conjugation - invariant measures on a compact lie group ( here @xmath0 ) on one hand and @xmath7-invariant measures on its lie algebra ( here @xmath8 ) on the other , in terms of the so - called wrapping map ( see @xcite and remark [ wrapping ] ) .",
    "klyachko noticed in @xcite , but did not not explain that his connection can be well expressed in terms of hypergroups ; his proof goes via random walks in the group @xmath0 and relies on various identities between the spherical functions of @xmath5 , the characters of @xmath0 and the euclidean group @xmath2 , as well as poisson s summation formula .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to clarify and simplify klyachko s approach @xcite by using so - called deformations of hypergroup convolutions by positive semicharacters as introduced in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our description in particular implies that the banach algebra @xmath9 of @xmath0-biinvariant signed measures on @xmath1 with total variation norm is isometrically isomorphic to a certain banach subalgebra of @xmath10 , whereby probability measures are being prserved .",
    "we finally show how this leads to new proofs for ( known ) limit theorems for @xmath0-biinvariant random walks on @xmath1 .",
    "the explicit construction of this isomorphism runs as follows :    1 .",
    "@xmath0 acts on @xmath2 by conjugation as a group of orthogonal transformations .",
    "the space @xmath11 of all orbits can be identified with @xmath12 where @xmath13 represents the ordered eigenvalues of a matrix in @xmath2 .",
    "the banach algebra @xmath14 of all @xmath0-invariant bounded measures on @xmath2 can be identified with the banach algebra @xmath15 of the associated orbit hypergroup @xmath16 .",
    "the polar decomposition of @xmath17 shows that the double coset space @xmath18 may also be identified with @xmath19 where now for @xmath20 corresponds to the singular spectrum @xmath21 of some @xmath22 .",
    "this leads to a canonical banach algebra isomorphism between @xmath9 and the banach algebra @xmath23 of the double coset hypergroup @xmath24 .",
    "the characters of the hypergroups @xmath25 and @xmath26 are spherical functions of the corresponding symmetric spaces , and it is well - known that as functions on @xmath27 they only differ by a known factor @xmath28 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we prove that such a connection between the characters of two hypergroup structures on @xmath19 implies that their convolutions are related by a so - called hypergroup deformation .",
    "in particular , the supports of the convolution products of two point measures are the same in both hypergroups .",
    "this immediately implies the equivalence of the two spectral problems for hermitian and unitary matrices , the main result of klyachko @xcite .",
    "the deformation isomorphism , however , is not isometric and not probability preserving . to achieve this ,",
    "a final correction is needed : 4 .",
    "instead of looking at the banach algebra @xmath14 of all @xmath0-invariant measures on @xmath2 , we take a suitable exponential function @xmath290,\\infty[$ ] and observe that the norm - closure of @xmath30 is a banach algebra which turns out to be isometrically isomorphic to @xmath23 .",
    "putting all steps together one obtains the claimed probability preserving isometric isomorphism . for @xmath31",
    "this construction reflects the known close connection between the so - called naimark hypergroup @xmath32 and the bessel - kingman hypergroup @xmath33 ; see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "all results will be derived in the general setting of a complex connected semisimple lie group @xmath34 with finite center and maximal compact subgroup @xmath35 ; in the special situation above , @xmath36 . for further results concerning the associated hypergroup convolutions considered in this paper we refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we collect some relevant facts on commutative hypergroups and their deformations . in section 3",
    "we then use this deformation to show how the banach algebras of all @xmath35-biinvariant bounded complex measures on @xmath34 appear as subalgebras of the banach algebra of bounded complex measures on some euclidean space .",
    "the final section is devoted to probabilistic applications .",
    "in this section we give a quick introduction to hypergroups .",
    "we in particular prove a general result on deformations of hypergroup convolutions in proposition [ deform ] which is crucial for step ( 3 ) of our construction .",

    "if @xmath334 is a sequence on independent @xmath189-valued random variables with distributions @xmath335 , we get a random walk @xmath336 on @xmath189 whose projection @xmath337 is a random walk on @xmath25 with the same transition probabilities as @xmath338 , i.e. , @xmath337 and @xmath338 have the same finite dimensional distributions and therefore admit the same limit theorems .",
    "hence , limit theorems for the random walk @xmath339 on @xmath189 may be translated into limit theorems for @xmath338 .",
    "here is an example .",
    "assume that the @xmath340 are independent of @xmath157 , and that for the associated @xmath341 on @xmath189 the first moment vector @xmath342 exists . then by kolmogorov s strong law , @xmath343 almost surely as @xmath344 .",

    "this allows to compute the limiting constant @xmath349 directly on @xmath19 .",
    "we next define @xmath353 .",

    "the open weyl chamber @xmath373 corresponding to @xmath19 is an orthogonal transversal manifold for the adjoint action of @xmath35 on @xmath189 ( @xcite , ch.ii , 3.4.(vi ) ) .",
    "therefore the orthogonal complement @xmath374 of @xmath191 in @xmath189 coincides with the tangent space of the orbit @xmath375 in @xmath178 .",
