    "the origin of jets in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is one of the most important unsolved problems in extragalactic astrophysics .",
    "while 90% of all agn ( seyfert galaxies and radio - quiet quasars ) show little or no jet emission , the remaining 10% ( the radio - loud agn and radio - loud quasars ) launch powerful , relativistic twin jets of particles from their cores . since jets transport a significant fraction of the mass - energy liberated during the accretion process , sometimes out to @xmath4mpc distances , understanding how they are produced is key to a complete picture of accretion and feedback in agn .",
    "x - ray observations of the nuclei of radio - loud and radio - quiet agn are essential for establishing the connection between the accretion flow , black hole , and jet . in standard models of x - ray emission in agn ,",
    "quasi - isotropic power - law x - ray emission is generated in a corona that lies above a high @xmath5 accretion disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "a fraction of this hard x - ray emission is reflected by cold gas in the accretion disk , producing an observed spectrum imprinted with the features of photoelectric absorption , fluorescent 6.4 kev fe k@xmath0 line emission , and a compton backscattered reflection continuum that produces a bump in the spectrum above 10 kev ( @xcite ) . the fe k@xmath0 line may be relativistically broadened , which is the signature of disk reflection near the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) of the black hole ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in radio galaxies , there exists an _",
    "additional _ power - law component of x - ray emission that is associated with the parsec - scale jet ( e.g. , @xcite )    x - ray observations reveal systematic differences between the spectra of radio - loud and radio - quiet agn .",
    "disk reflection is commonly detected in radio - quiet galaxies ( @xcite ) : compton reflection bumps are prominent , and over 50% of local seyfert galaxies show broadened fe k@xmath0 emission from within 25 schwarzschild radii .",
    "this result may hold even when the effects of complex x - ray absorption are taken into account ( @xcite ) . on the other hand , radio - loud agn tend to show weak , or absent neutral compton reflection humps ( @xcite ) , and in most cases , unresolved neutral fe k@xmath0 lines ( @xcite ) .",
    "continuum x - ray observations of radio - loud agn have mostly been restricted to bright broad - line radio galaxies ( blrgs ) and quasars , which are oriented relatively close to the line of sight with respect to the observer . in these sources ,",
    "unabsorbed non - thermal emission from the jet could potentially contaminate the unabsorbed accretion - related x - ray spectrum and thus dilute the apparent strength of the compton reflection component .",
    "_ narrow_-line radio galaxies ( nlrgs ) , on the other hand , which are oriented at low to intermediate angles , have the distinct advantage that ( unabsorbed ) jet - related x - ray emission can be readily spectrally separated from ( heavily absorbed ) accretion - related emission , allowing a direct measurement of the strength of compton reflection .",
    "however , narrow - line radio galaxies tend to be relatively faint x - ray sources compared to broad - line objects , meaning that _ suzaku _ observations of these sources are particularly useful , owing to the high effective area of the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) and hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) instruments .    here , we present the results from _ suzaku _ and _ swift _ observations of one of the brightest nlrgs , 3c33 , .",
    "it is the only nlrg to show potential evidence for compton reflection in its 210 kev x - ray spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "the source may also show evidence of photoionized emission lines in its x - ray spectrum ( @xcite ) , which would make it one of the few radio - loud agn to do so . in this paper",

    "we added the nxb and cxb spectra together using the mathpha tool . using the appropriate response file for epoch 4 of _ suzaku _ observations , ae_hxd_pinhxnome4_20080129.rsp , we binned the source spectrum to 3@xmath17 above the total ( nxb + cxb ) background level .",

    "both models have distinct advantages over simple parameterizations of the nuclear continuum : they adequately explain the low - energy spectrum and reconcile the photon index of the primary power law with canonical values found in radio galaxies . however , we are unable to distinguish between these models due to the lack of photon statistics at lower energies , where discrete ionized absorption features would be observed in the case of the warm absorber .",

    "we can also calculate the upper limit to the radius , @xmath65 , in the case of the warm absorber model , since the ionizing luminosity , @xmath66 , where @xmath47 is the ionization parameter and @xmath67 is the electron number density .",
    "assuming that the thickness of the absorber is less than the distance to the absorber from the source of ionization , i.e. , @xmath68 , we can establish the inequality @xmath69 .",
    "we find @xmath70  pc , which is consistent with the parsec - scale absorber invoked in agn unification models .",
    "there is clear evidence of a ` soft excess ' in the x - ray spectrum of 3c33 .",
    "we consider several possibilities for its origin here .",
    "first , the emission could be the result of patchy circumnuclear absorption ( either neutral or partially ionized ) , which allows a small fraction of continuum emission to be transmitted free from obscuration .",
    "such a model is consistent with observations of numerous agn , including ngc2110 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of variability of the source on timescales of years (  [ jointfitting ] ) suggests that such a patchy absorber would subtend a large solid angle at the source of the x - ray emission .",
    "second , the soft emission could represent the scattering of the primary ( heavily obscured ) power - law emission in to the line of sight , as is predicted by unified models of agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    ", the emission is scattered by free electrons in the vicinity of the broad - line region and may be associated with the ( possibly photoionized ) circumnuclear regions of the agn .",
    "the ` efficiency ' of scattering is simply given by the ratio of the normalizations of the primary and soft power laws  for 3c33 , we find the efficiency to be @xmath42% . this number is consistent with the typical range found in seyfert galaxies of 110% ( @xcite ) .",
    "further support for this model comes from the spatially extended soft x - ray and [ o  iii ] on scales of @xmath45  kpc emission seen in _",
    "chandra _ and _ hst _ observations of the source ( @xcite ) .",
    "the emission is elongated along the axis of the large - scale radio emission in the source , and therefore likely along the axis of the circumnuclear obscurer described by unification models . in this case",
    ", we might expect a contribution from photoionized emission lines in the soft x - ray spectrum in the case of 3c33 , as argued by @xcite .",
    "our combined soft x - ray spectrum ( fig .  [ softlines ] ) shows possible hints of he - like species of o  vii and mg  xi , but there are insufficient photon statistics to determine if we are witnessing photoionized gas .",
    "a third and final possibility is that the soft x - ray emission is _ not _ associated with the primary x - ray emission related to the accretion flow , and instead originates in an unresolved parsec - scale jet . given that 3c33 is a strongly radio - loud agn",
    ", a contribution to the x - ray emission from the jet is not unexpected , and has been argued for extensively in other radio galaxies by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the key to these authors interpretations is the strong observed correlation between the x - ray and radio core luminosities in large samples of radio - loud agn , which they argue supports a common origin of the two components at the base of a jet . in figure  [ lum - lum ]",
    ", we show the 1-kev and 5-ghz luminosity densities of all observed @xmath25@xmath70.5 radio galaxies ( @xcite ) , together with 3c33 .",
    "this figure shows that 3c33 has a similar measured x - ray luminosity to that predicted from the @xcite relation .    in summary",
    ", we can not distinguish between these three physical scenarios .",
    "future observations with the gratings instruments on board _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ would allow us to determine which is correct .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "open circles are lerg , filled circles nlrg , open stars blrg , and filled stars quasars .",
    "large surrounding circles indicate that a source is an fri .",
    "3c33 is marked by a box .",
    "dotted lines show the regression line to all data and its 1@xmath17 confidence range .",
    "the similarity of 3c33 to the other sources suggests that its soft x - ray component originates in an unresolved jet , although we can not rule out other interpretations.,width=302 ]      our results demonstrate that 3c33 shows no signs of compton reflection from neutral material in the inner regions of an accretion disk : there is no reflection hump at energies @xmath610  kev , and no evidence for relativistically broadened fe  k@xmath0 emission ( model vii ) .",
    "indeed , the narrow fe k@xmath0 line is likely to originate in a much farther region , at least 2,000  r@xmath3 from the black hole .",
    "further , as 3c33 is a _",
    "narrow_-line radio galaxy , meaning we can spectrally separate the x - ray emission associated with the accretion flow and jet , we rule out the idea that x - ray emission from the jet dilutes the reflection spectrum of the source at high energies .",
    "the lack of a compton hump in 3c33 is consistent with growing numbers of radio - loud agn observed with _",
    "suzaku _ to show systematically weaker reflection than their radio - quiet counterparts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are two principal models that can explain this dichotomy , which basically stem from differences in either the accretion flow geometry , or the black - hole spin configuration .",
    "we examine both in the context of 3c33 below .",
    "@xcite interpret the weak reflection features observed in radio - loud agn such as 3c33 to be the result of an ionized inner accretion flow . since the reflected spectrum of an incident power law on to highly ionized material is itself a power law ,",
    "they demonstrate that the reflection fraction , @xmath43 , can remain arbitrarily high .",
    "our attempt to fit an ionized reflection model ( @xcite ) to 3c33 led to the ionization parameter pegging at its hard limit of @xmath47=@xmath48 ergs  cm  s@xmath15 ( model viii ) . for 3c33 , therefore , we can not distinguish between a very highly ionized reflector , or simply an absent inner disk .",
    "we further note that the lack of ionized fe  k@xmath0 emission is consistent with this hypothesis .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of 3c33 is also consistent with the picture of @xcite .",
    "they argue the jet power of high - excitation radio galaxies such as 3c33 is the result of retrograde black - hole spin with respect to the accreting material .",
    "this configuration results in a larger innermost circular stable orbit than for a prograde black hole .",
    "the weak or absent signatures of reflection in 3c33 , then , are simply a consequence of the large inner disk radius . furthermore , @xcite show that the retrograde spin configuration produces both strong blandford - payne and blandford - znajek jets ( @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "they point out that this highly relativistic motion away from the inner accretion flow can easily wash out reflection features , as first demonstrated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our x - ray observations of 3c33 support this scenario .    in summary ,",
    "we have presented two , equally plausible , models that can explain the paucity of a compton reflection hump in 3c33 .",
    "future , high - sensitivity observations of 3c33 with _",
    "ixo _ will be needed to distinguish between them .",
    "we have presented results from a new 100-ks _ suzaku _ observation of the radio galaxy 3c33 .",
    "the _ suzaku _",
    "data have allowed us to break degeneracies in the reflection and absorption properties of 3c33 that were present in our previous _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "we have shown the following :    1 .",
    "the nuclear x - ray spectrum of 3c33 is well described by a power law of photon index @xmath41.7 that is absorbed either through one or more layers of pc - scale neutral material , or through a partially ionized pc - scale obscurer .",
    "both models have distinct advantages over simple parameterizations of the nuclear continuum : they adequately explain the low - energy spectrum and reconcile the photon index of the primary power law with canonical values found in radio galaxies . 2 .",
    "there is evidence for a ` soft excess ' in the x - ray spectrum of 3c33 .",
    "its origin is consistent with several possibilities , including patchy circumnuclear absorption , photoionized gas , and an unresolved parsec - scale jet .",
    "3c33 shows no signs of compton reflection from neutral material in the inner regions of an accretion disk : the upper limit to the reflection fraction for neutral material is @xmath1 for an @xmath2-folding energy of 1  gev .",
    "the observed fe k@xmath0 line originates in neutral or near - neutral material at least 2,000  r@xmath3 from the black hole .",
    "we can not rule out the presence of a modestly broadened ( @xmath62 ) , ionized fe  k@xmath0 line in 3c33 but nonetheless it seems clear that fluorescent emission from the inner disk is absent .",
    "the absence of a compton reflection hump in 3c33 is consistent with either an _ ionized _ accretion flow ( @xcite ) , or with retrograde black - hole spin ( @xcite ) .",
