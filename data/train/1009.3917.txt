    "the cmds based on cfht data are shallower with limiting magnitudes @xmath45 and @xmath46 mag .",

    "their number decreases rapidly when moving from the center to the outermost galaxy regions .",
    "a handful of them are visible in region  w \" , while the blue objects of region  s \" might be field galaxies .",
    "_ iii ) _ the different apparent colors of rgb stars when moving from the center to the outermost regions further support the occurrence of differential reddening .",
    "we estimated the reddening of region  w \" using the same approach adopted in @xcite .",
    "the ridgeline of the rgb in this field was adopted to estimate the reddening in the regions covered by subaru data .",
    "the ridgeline of the contaminating blue field stars located in region  s4 \" was used to estimate the reddening in the regions covered by cfht data .",
    "we found that the reddening is higher along the semi - major axis ( @xmath49 mag ) and attains an almost constant value ( @xmath50 mag ) in the regions covered by the subaru data external to the hst data . in the regions covered by the cfht data external to the subaru data the reddening attains either similar ( @xmath50 mag ) or smaller ( @xmath51 mag ) values in the sw direction ( sanna et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) .",

    "iv ) _ old rgb stars are ubiquitous and they can be easily identified in hst and subaru cmds . to properly identify rgb stars we also plotted an @xmath24-enhanced isochrone ( green line ) of 13 gyr at fixed metal content ( total metallicity , [ m / h]=-0.66 dex ; helium content , y=0.251 ) from the basti data base @xcite .",

    "the above results indicate that the radial extent of ic10 has been significantly underestimated , and indeed according to the subaru data the diameter is at least of the order of 36 - 46@xmath2 and probably larger than one degree according to the cfht data .    to further constrain the radial extent of ic10",

    "this approach presents several advantages when compared with the method based on the statistical subtraction of an external control field . _",
    "i ) _ it is not affected by reddening differences between the galactic and the control field . _",
    "ii ) _ it is not affected by completeness problems of the control field , thus saving telescope time .",
    "_ iii ) _ the real radial extent of these stellar systems it is not known in advance . therefore , the control fields might still be located inside their halo .",
    "the main drawback is that mw models need to be validated using deep and accurate star counts covering broad sky regions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , the ground - based and space data sets are characterized by different limiting magnitudes . to provide a robust estimate of the completeness of the former data sets , we compared their luminosity function ( lf ) with the lf of the wfpc2 data for pointing",
    "we adopted this approach since we are interested in estimating the completeness down to 1.5 magnitudes fainter than the trgb , i.e. , @xmath58  mag . in this magnitude",
    "range the wfpc2 data are minimally affected by completeness problems .",
    "we have found that the completeness is @xmath59% for the subaru at the limiting magnitude of @xmath60 mag , while it is @xmath59% for the cfht at the limiting magnitude of @xmath61 mag .",
    "we have chosen the above limiting magnitudes to apply conservative completeness corrections to both the suprime - cam and the mega - cam data .    in order to compare theory and observations",
    ", we used the pisa @xcite and the padova @xcite mw model .",
    "we focused our attention on two outer regions covering the same sky area , with the same mean reddening ( @xmath50 mag ) and located in the ne direction , namely the ",

    "3 show the ratio between the number of observed stars and the number of candidate field stars predicted by the quoted mw models .",
    "star counts were smoothed using a gaussian kernel at fixed @xmath3 .",
    "we also estimated the number of unresolved background galaxies , with reddened @xmath1-band magnitudes and   colors typical of the tip of rgb stars , using empirical galaxy counts @xcite and it was subtracted to the number of observed stars . to avoid spurious fluctuations caused by the limited sky area covered by observations , theory and observations were normalized in the bright end ( 17.9@xmath68i@xmath6818.4 mag ) .",
    "the bottom left panels display the comparison with the pisa mw model .",
    "there is evidence of ic10 stars across the trgb region ( @xmath69 mag ) in both the  s4 \" ( left , 1.59@xmath530.13 ) and the  m2 \" ( right , 1.38@xmath53 0.12 ) field .",
    "the star count excess is at 3@xmath3 level .",
    "the above evidence further supports the occurrence of ic10 stars in the region covered by the mega - cam data , since in the  s4 \" region we clearly identified ic10 rg stars .",
    "the bottom right panels of fig .",
    "3 display the comparison between observations and the padova mw model .",
    "there is once again a clear evidence of a star excess across the trgb region in both the  s4 \" ( left , 1.74@xmath530.14 ) and the  m2 \" ( right , 1.53@xmath530.14 ) field ( @xmath9 4@xmath3 level ) .",
    "the two galactic models were constructed assuming similar input parameters(height)=250 pc , @xmath70(scale length)=3000 pc , constant star formation rate [ sfr ] for t@xmath68 7 gyr , z(mean metallicity)=0.02 ) ; exponential thick disk ( @xmath71=1000 pc , @xmath70=3500 pc , constant sfr for 5@xmath68t@xmath6812 gyr , z=0.006 ) ; oblate halo with @xmath72 ( @xmath70=2800 pc , @xmath73(semiaxis ratio)=0.8 , constant sfr for 11@xmath68t@xmath6813 gyr , z=0.0002 ) . ] .",
    "the difference in the star count ratios between the two models is due to the different evolutionary inputs and to the normalization of the star counts in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the above findings indicate that the radial distribution of ic10 old and intermediate - age stellar populations agrees quite well with the size of the huge hydrogen cloud detected by @xcite and by @xcite , and cover more than one square degree across the galaxy ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "this means that the stellar halo and the hydrogen cloud have , within the errors , similar radial extents and resolve this peculiar feature of ic10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , this evidence further supports the hypothesis that the hydrogen cloud is associated with the galaxy ( stellar mass loss , pristine gas ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to estimate the total luminosity we need to select candidate ic10 stars . to describe the procedure , fig .",

    "the difference between @xmath311 and @xmath312 is in the mean reddening ( see fig .  4 ) . for the stars located in the overlapping regions we use the hst photometry .",
    "the candidate ic10 stars were selected using different boxes in the aforementioned cmds .",
    "the green box includes young ms stars ( @xmath76 mag ) , the cyan box the intermediate - age stars ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 mag ) , while the pink box includes old and intermediate - age rg stars ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 mag ) .",

    "4 , show two young scaled solar abundance isochrones @xcite at fixed metallicity ( [ m / h]=-0.66 dex ) and ages of @xmath81 and 200 myr , while the solid red line shows the old @xmath24-enhanced isochrone with the same total metallicity and an age of @xmath82 gyr .",
    "these isochrones validate the position of the boxes we adopted to pinpoint the different subpopulations of ic10 .",
    "the same approach was adopted to select candidate ic10 stars located between the blue circle of fig .  1 and the outermost regions of the @xmath31 pointing ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "on the basis of these data and of the recent ic10 distance based on the trgb ( 830 kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we estimated a total @xmath33-band luminosity of @xmath84 @xmath85 and a total magnitude of @xmath8=-15.11 mag .",
    "this estimate agrees within a factor of two with similar estimates available in the literature ( @xmath86 @xmath85 , @xcite ; @xmath8=-16.0 mag , @xcite ) .",
    "the current estimate is a lower limit , since we are not including the stars located in the outermost regions covered by our photometry ( pointing @xmath32 ) .",
    "however , the estimates available in the literature only cover the innermost galactic regions .",
    "the difference is mainly due to the fact that the current photometry allows us a robust identification of field stars ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 mag , see the blue arrow in the bottom left panel of fig .  4 ) .",
    "if they are even partially included , these objects introduce a systematic bias in the estimate of the total luminosity .",
    "the different assumptions concerning the adopted distance and reddening variation also help to explain the above difference .        to estimate the mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratio of ic10 we restricted ourself to the galactic regions where rotational velocity measurements are available ( see the blue circle with a diameter of 13@xmath2 in fig .  1 ) .",
    "the luminosity inside this area is @xmath89 ( @xmath90  mag ) . by using the quoted true distance and diameter together with the rotation velocity based on h regions ( ss89 ) we found , following @xcite and @xcite , a total mass of @xmath91x@xmath23 that agrees quite well with similar estimates available in the literature @xcite . eventually , we found m / l @xmath910 @xmath92 .",
    "although this estimate is hampered by several empirical limitations it is at least one order of magnitude larger than the value recently provided by @xcite .",
    "the quoted authors use two independent methods to estimate the m / l ratios of lg dwarf galaxies : colors and inferred star formation history .",
    "they found that the median m / l ratio of dis based on the latter approach is slightly smaller than on the former one ( 0.7 vs 0.8 , see their table2 ) .",
    "however , the difference needs to be investigated in more detail , particularly in view of the severe limitations affecting the estimates of the rotational velocity and of the total luminosity over the entire body of the galaxy .",
    "we are facing empirical evidence that dis seem to show smaller m / l ratios when compared with dwarf ellipticals ( see fig .  1 and table  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the new data will allow us to constrain whether this evidence might be affected by observational biases .",
    "moreover , they can shed new lights on the prediction that dwarf galaxies might have tidal radii significantly larger than empirical estimates @xcite ."
