    "we consider trees that are _ binary , non - plane , unlabelled , and rooted _ ; that is , a tree is taken in the graph - theoretic sense and it has nodes of ( out)degree two or zero only ; a special node is distinguished , the root , which has degree two . in this model , _",
    "the nodes are indistinguishable _ , and no order is assumed between the neighbours of a node .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the class of such trees , and let @xmath2 be the subset consisting of trees with @xmath0 external nodes ( i.e. , nodes of degree  zero ) . in this article , we study the ( random ) _ height _ @xmath3 of a tree sampled uniformly from @xmath2 .",
    "most of the results concerning random trees of fixed size are relative to the situation where one can _ distinguish _ the neighbours of a node , either by their labels ( labelled trees ) , or by the order induced on the progeny through an embedding in the plane ( plane trees ) ; see the reference books  @xcite and the discussion by aldous  @xcite who globally refers to these as _ `` ordered trees''_. in this range of models , meir and moon  @xcite determined that the depth of nodes is typically @xmath4 for all `` _ _ simple varieties _ _ '' of trees , which are determined by restricting in an arbitrary way the collection of allowed node degrees . regarding height , a few special cases were studied early : rnyi and szekeres  @xcite proved in particular that the average height of _ labelled _ non - plane trees of size  @xmath0 is asymptotic to @xmath5 ; de bruijn , knuth , and rice  @xcite dealt with _",
    "plane _ trees and showed that the average height is equivalent to @xmath6 as @xmath7 .",
    "eventually , flajolet and odlyzko  @xcite developed an approach for height that encompasses all simple varieties of trees ; see also  @xcite for additional results .",
    "under such models with distinguishable neighbourhoods , trees of a fixed size @xmath0 may be seen as galton  watson processes ( branching processes ) conditioned on the size being @xmath0 , see  @xcite , and there are natural random walks associated to various tree traversals .",
    "accordingly , probabilistic techniques have been successfully applied to quantify tree height and width  @xcite , based on brownian excursion .",
    "an important probabilistic approach consists in establishing the existence of a continuous limit of suitably rescaled random trees of increasing sizes  one can then read off , to first asymptotic order at least , some of the limit parameters directly on the limiting object .",
    "the latter point of view has been adopted by aldous  @xcite in his definition of the _ continuum random tree _ ( crt ) : see the survey by le gall  @xcite for a recent account of probabilistic developments along these lines .",
    "the case of trees ( as are considered here ) that have _ indistinguishable neighbourhoods _ is essentially different .",
    "such trees can not be generated by a branching process conditioned by size and no direct random walk approach appears to be possible , due to the inherent presence of symmetries .",
    "( an analysis of such symmetries otherwise occurs in the recent article  @xcite . )",
    "the analysis of unlabelled non - plane trees finds its origins in the works of plya  @xcite and otter  @xcite .",
    "however , these authors mostly focused on enumeration  the problem of characterizing typical parameters of these random trees remained largely untouched . recently , in an independent study , drmota and gittenberger  @xcite have examined the profile of _ `` general '' trees _ ( where all degrees are allowed ) and shown that the joint distribution of the number of nodes at a finite number of levels converges weakly to the finite dimensional distribution of brownian excursion local times .",
    "they further extended the result to a convergence of the entire profile to the brownian excursion local time .",
    "the foregoing discussion suggests that , although there is no clear _ exact _ reduction of unlabelled non - plane trees to random walks , such trees largely behave like simply generated families of ordered trees . in particular , it suggests that the rescaled height @xmath8 is likely to admit a limit distribution of the theta - function type  @xcite .",
    "we shall prove that such is indeed the case for _ non - plane binary trees _ in theorems  [ clt ] and  [ llt ] below .",
    "we also provide moderate and large deviations estimates ( theorems  [ thm : moderate ] and  [ thm : large_deviations ] ) , as well as asymptotic estimates for moments ( theorem  [ thm : moments ] ) , see   [ asy - sec ] .",
    "equipped with solid analytic estimates regarding height , we can then proceed to characterize the _ diameter of unrooted trees _ in   [ sec : diam ] , this both in a local and central form ( theorems  [ locdiam - thm ] and  [ centdiam - thm ] ) .",
    "some _ a posteriori _ observations that complete the picture are offered in our conclusion section ,  [ sec : concl ] .    a preliminary investigation of the distribution of height in rooted trees is reported in the extended abstract @xcite .",
    "our interest in this range of problems initially arose from questions of jean - franois marckert and grgory miermont @xcite , in their endeavour to extend the probabilistic methods of aldous to non - plane trees and develop corresponding continuous models ",
    "we are indebted to them for being at the origin of the present study .",

    "needs to consider the second terms of the singular expansion of @xmath652 , at @xmath663 and @xmath754 , respectively . also , the cases @xmath662 and @xmath755 involve logarithmic terms due to double poles of @xmath756 and @xmath757 at @xmath663 and @xmath758 .",
    "the claim follows by routine mellin technology and singularity analysis .",
    "we finally conclude with two corollaries and a general comment . first , as a byproduct of   and  , via summation and singularity analysis , we can estimate the proportion of centred and bicentred trees .",
    "[ cor - oddeve ] there are asymptotically as many centred trees ( trees of even diameter ) as bicentred trees ( trees of odd diameter ) : @xmath660u^{\\operatorname{odd}}(z ) \\sim [ z^n]u^{\\operatorname{even}}(z ) \\sim \\frac12 u_n.\\ ] ]        [ cor - ratio ] the ratio of the expected diameter of an unrooted tree and the expected height of a rooted tree of the same size satisfies asymptotically @xmath759}}{{{\\mathbb e}\\left [ h_n\\right]}}=\\frac43.\\ ] ]    again , a similar observation was made by szekeres  @xcite regarding labelled trees and the same property , with a `` universal '' @xmath760 factor is expected to hold for any `` ordered '' tree family ( i.e. , trees whose nodes have neighbours that are distinguishable ; cf our introduction ) , as argued heuristically by aldous in  @xcite .",
    "the fact , established rigorously in the present paper ( theorems  [ clt ] to  [ momdiam - thm ] and corollaries  [ cor - oddeve ] , [ cor - ratio ] ) , is that , up to scaling , height and diameter behave for some non - plane unlabelled trees similarly to what is known for ordered trees : see figure  [ compare - fig ] for some striking data .",
    "this brings further evidence for the hypothesis that probabilistic models , such as the _ continuum random tree _ , may be applicable to unordered trees  this has indeed been recently confirmed , in the binary case at least , by marckert and miermont  @xcite .",
    "it is piquant to note that the probabilistic approach of  @xcite relies in part on large deviation estimates for height , which were developed analytically by us in the earlier conference version  @xcite of the present paper .",
    "( recently , @xcite have developped an alternative approach that further allows them to prove the convergence of a large class of trees towards continuum limits .",
    "this encompasses a self - contained proof of the result in @xcite and other more examples with stable tree limits . )",
    "an analytic treatment of the height of unordered trees with all degrees allowed has been given recently by drmota and gittenberger ( see  @xcite and the account in  @xcite ) . together with the present study , it confirms , among unordered trees , the existence of universal phenomena regarding height and profile , which parallel what has been known for a long time regarding their ordered counterparts .",
    "as usual , the analytic approach advocated in the present paper has the advantage of providing precise estimates , with speed of convergence estimates , local limit laws , and convergence of moments .    finally , the fact that , up to a possible linear change of scale , some of the main characteristics of trees , such as height and diameter , are not sensitive to whether trees are planar ( ordered ) or not , is also of some relevance to the emerging field of `` probabilistic logic ''  @xcite .",
    "for instance , there is interest there in determining the probability of satisfiability of random boolean formulae obeying various randomness models ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in this context",
    ", our results suggest that the commutativity of logical conjunction and disjunction ( reflected by the non - planarity of associated expression trees ) should not , in many cases , have a major effect on complexity properties of random boolean expressions",
