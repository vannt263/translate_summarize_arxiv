    "this can be explained by the following argument . in cylinder geometry ,",
    "the wave functions are localized , and the level broadening @xmath202 created by the metallic lead attached at the edge @xmath203 is strongly coordinate dependent . indeed , the overlap of a wave function localized at a point @xmath204 away from the cylinder edge with the extended wave functions in the lead is exponentially small , which results in an escape rate , that is , a level broadening that is exponentially decaying away from the edge : @xmath205 here @xmath5 is the typical localization length .",
    "thus , away from the edge , the profile of the ldos ( as a function of energy ) consists of well resolved narrow lorentzian peaks ( see eq.([lorentzian ] ) ) of width of order @xmath206 and height proportional to @xmath207 . only within the range @xmath199 corresponding to @xmath208",
    "are the moments of the ldos determined by the minima of the ldos profile ( where the ldos is proportional to @xmath206 ) . for other values of @xmath7",
    "the dominant contribution to the moments of ldos comes from the maxima in the ldos profile . in the described situation",
    "the behavior of the moments of the wave functions is very different from that of the moments of the ldos .",
    "however , we can directly relate the latter to the transmission through the cylinder from the metallic lead .",
    "essentially , the transmission will be exponentially small away from the edge of the cylinder if the energy of the incoming wave ( in the lead ) corresponds to a minimum in the ldos profile , but will be of order one ( it can not be bigger ) if the energy is in resonance with one of the broadened energy levels ( that is , a peak in the ldos profile ) ."
