    "standard feynman diagram techniques often obscure the underlying simplicity of on - shell scattering amplitudes .",
    "one reason for this is that individual feynman diagrams are not gauge invariant and contain unphysical degrees of freedom .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome by working with on - shell diagrams @xcite , which are built out of 3-point vertices using bcfw recursion @xcite and do not contain virtual particles . moreover , scattering amplitudes often exhibit symmetries which are hidden from the point of view of the spacetime lagrangian . in the case of @xmath1 super - yang - mills ( sym )",
    "@xcite , on - shell diagrams make the yangian symmetry of the amplitudes manifest and reveal an underlying grassmannian structure @xcite .",
    "the yangian symmetry arises from combining ordinary superconformal symmetry with dual superconformal symmetry @xcite , which provides a canonical definition for the loop integrand of the planar @xmath1 sym s - matrix , ultimately making it possible to extend bcfw recursion to loop - level @xcite .",
    "bcfw recursion for loop amplitudes was also studied in @xcite . on -",
    "shell diagrams also reveal an underlying cluster algebra structure in @xmath1 sym amplitudes which is encoded in the dlog form of loop integrands ( this form was simultaneously derived using the wilson loop in twistor space @xcite ) .",
    "there is also evidence that the dlog form of loop integrands persists in the non - planar sector @xcite .",
    "ultimately , on - shell diagrams and their correspondence to positive cells of the grassmannian suggest a geometric interpretation of scattering amplitudes as the volume of a new object known as the amplituhedron @xcite .",
    "an important question is how to generalize these ideas beyond planar @xmath1 sym .",
    "although there has been some work on non - planar on - shell diagrams @xcite , on - shell diagrams for form factors in @xmath1 sym @xcite , and amplitudes in @xmath4 sym @xcite , on - shell diagrams for gravitational amplitudes have so far not been explored .",
    "since gravity amplitudes are intrinsically non - planar , any new results in this direction may also suggest new techniques for computing non - planar ym amplitudes . in this paper , we take the first steps in this direction by developing an on - shell diagram formalism for @xmath0 supergavity ( sugra ) , which is the natural starting point since it is maximally supersymmetric and its amplitudes also exhibit a great deal of simplicity @xcite .",
    "we develop on - shell diagrams for tree - level amplitudes in @xmath0 sugra using bcfw recursion .",
    "our diagrammatic recursion relation is similar to that of @xmath1 sym but has some important differences .",
    "for example , the bcfw bridge used to combine lower - point on - shell diagrams is modified with respect to the one in @xmath1 sym ( we will soon see that this simply amounts to adding a decoration to the bcfw bridge of @xmath1 sym ) . moreover , since gravity amplitudes are permutation invariant  and there is no concept of colour ordering  the on - shell diagrams which arise from the recursion relation will generically be non - planar .",
    "nevertheless , we show that it is possible to restrict the recursion relation to a planar sector of on - shell diagrams , from which the full scattering amplitudes are obtained simply by summing over permutations of the external legs .",
    "if one chooses to work outside of the planar sector , this gives rise to remarkable new identities for non - planar on - shell diagrams .",
    "the on - shell diagrams of @xmath0 sugra also exhibit equivalence relations analogous to those of @xmath1 sym such as square moves and mergers .",
    "we also show that on - shell diagrams can be easily computed by assigning variables and arrows to the edges of the diagrams , and reading off expressions directly from the diagrams using a simple set of rules .",
    "ultimately , this approach gives rise to new grassmannian integral formulae for the scattering amplitudes , which further imply a form of positivity in the planar sector from which the amplitudes can be derived .",
    "grassmannian integral formulae for @xmath0 supergravity amplitudes have previously been deduced from twistor string theory @xcite , and it would be interesting to see how they are related to our formulae . finally , we show that the 1-loop 4-point amplitude of @xmath0 sugra can be obtained from on - shell diagrams , which suggests the possiblity of formulating loop - level bcfw recursion in this theory as well .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the difficulties of feynman diagrams can be overcome by using bcfw recursion relations to express higher - point on - shell amplitudes in terms of lower - point on - shell amplitudes . in four dimensions ,",
    "an on - shell momentum for a massless particle can be written in the following bispinor form : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are chiral and antichiral spinor indices .",
    "for supersymmetric theories , the particles also have supermomentum : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is grassman odd and @xmath10 and @xmath11 denotes the amount of supersymmetry",
    ".    the bcfw recursion relations are natrually encoded by on - shell diagrams , which differ from standard feynman diagrams in that they do not contain virtual particles .",
    "the building blocks for on - shell diagrams are 3-point mhv and anti - mhv amplitudes , which encode the scattering of three gluons or gravitons with helicity @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "more generally , @xmath14-point n@xmath15mhv amplitudes encode the scattering of @xmath16 particles of negative helicity and @xmath17 particles of positive helicity .",
    "the 3-point mhv amplitudes of @xmath0 sugra are essentially the square of their @xmath1 sym counterparts and are given by @xmath18\\eta_{3}+\\left[23\\right]\\eta_{1}+\\left[31\\right]\\eta_{2}\\right)}{\\left[12\\right]^{2}\\left[23\\right]^{2}\\left[31\\right]^{2}}\\delta^{4}\\left(\\lambda_{1}\\tilde{\\lambda}_{1}+\\lambda_{2}\\tilde{\\lambda}_{2}+\\lambda_{3}\\tilde{\\lambda}_{3}\\right),\\,\\,\\,\\lambda_{1}\\propto\\lambda_{2}\\propto\\lambda_{3}\\notag\\\\ \\mathcal{\\mathcal{a}}^{\\overline{\\text{mhv}}}_{3}&=\\frac{\\delta^{16}\\left(\\lambda_{1}\\eta_{1}+\\lambda_{2}\\eta_{2}+\\lambda_{3}\\eta_{3}\\right)}{\\left\\langle 12\\right\\rangle ^{2}\\left\\langle 23\\right\\rangle ^{2}\\left\\langle 31\\right\\rangle ^{2}}\\delta^{4}\\left(\\lambda_{1}\\tilde{\\lambda}_{1}+\\lambda_{2}\\tilde{\\lambda}_{2}+\\lambda_{3}\\tilde{\\lambda}_{3}\\right),\\,\\,\\,\\tilde{\\lambda}_{1}\\propto\\tilde{\\lambda}_{2}\\propto\\tilde{\\lambda}_{3}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we denote these building blocks with on - shell diagrams using black and white vertices , respectively : @xmath19 more general on - shell diagrams are constructed by connecting 3-point vertices and integrating over the on - shell supermomenta associated with the internal edges between two vertices : @xmath20 where the measure is over @xmath21 modulo the little group phase @xmath22 , which we denote by quotienting by vol @xmath23 .    in order to construct on - shell diagrams corresponding to higher - point amplitudes , one uses the bcfw bridge : @xmath24 which is essentially a decorated version of the one for @xmath1 sym .",
    "parameterizing the momentum through the internal edge by @xmath25 , one finds that @xmath26 @xmath27 hence , this diagram corresponds to bcfw shifting legs @xmath28 .",
    "in addition to this , we must multiply the diagram by the factor @xmath29 , which we indicate by making the central line dashed . since @xmath30 , it does nt matter which two momenta we choose for the decoration , as long as there is one on either side of the decoration .",
    "we will derive this decoration in the next subsection .    using the above rules , on - shell diagrams for higher - point tree - level scattering amplitudes",
    "can be constructed by connecting on - shell diagrams for lower - point amplitudes with a bcfw bridge and summing over all permutations of the unshifted legs , as depicted in figure  [ tree ] .",
    "sugra , the bridge is decorated and the sum is over all ways of partitioning particles @xmath31 into two sets @xmath32 . ]      the basic idea underlying bcfw recursion is to deform the momenta of two legs of an on - shell amplitude by a complex parameter .",
    "after doing so , the amplitude develops poles in the deformation parameter and the residues correspond to products of lower - point on - shell amplitudes , allowing one to compute higher - point amplitudes from lower - point amplitudes.the bcfw recursion relations can be applied to a very broad range of theories such as yang - mills @xcite and gravity @xcite in @xmath33 dimensions , and can also be adapted to @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetric form of the bcfw recursion relation  @xcite takes the form @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the set of all external supermomenta @xmath37 .",
    "there are two special particles , @xmath38 and the sum on the rhs is over all bipartitions of the particle numbers such that @xmath39 is in one partition and @xmath40 in the other , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 the corresponding sets of supermomenta . the hats over the external ( massless ) supermomenta on the rhs indicate the following deformations ( in spinor helicity form ) @xmath43 with all other @xmath44 remaining undeformed . finally the hatted internal supermomenta are defined as @xmath45 with @xmath46 which fixes @xmath47)\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a remarkable feature of the bcfw recursion is that the result is independent of the choice of special points @xmath38 .",
    "the above formula is valid for both sym and sugra .",
    "we now compare the terms in this bcfw resursion   with its form as a bcfw bridge .",
    "the idea is that each term in the sum on the rhs of  ( [ eq:1 ] ) has the interpretation of an on - shell diagram consisting of two on - shell amplitudes @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( which will themselves can be recursively described via on - shell diagrams ) together with a three - point mhv and a three - point @xmath50 amplitude connected with four internal lines , as depicted in the picture below .",
    "each internal line yields an integration over the on - shell supermomentum flowing through it  .",
    "hence , this on - shell diagram simply represents @xmath51 let us first consider consider integrating the bosonic parts of the measures @xmath52 against the bosonic delta functions associated with the 3-point amplitudes .",
    "there are nine bosonic integrations and eight bosonic delta functions , so we have one left over integration which when combined with the integral over the on - shell momentum @xmath53 gives rise to an integral over and off - shell momentum @xmath54 .",
    "writing @xmath55 we find that @xmath56 the @xmath57 arises from jacobians and is a key point when considering @xmath3 supergravity . on the rhs , internal momenta have been integrated out against delta functions and so must be replaced by the result of this , indicated by the vertical line .",
    "the explicit replacements are @xmath58 where @xmath59 is defined in  .",
    "finally we need to do the integration over internal fermionic degrees of freedom and consider the explicit form of the three - point amplitudes .",
    "this is where the dependence on @xmath60 comes into the computations for the first time .",
    "the three - point amplitudes are given as : @xmath61+\\eta_2    [ 31]+\\eta_3 [ 12 ] )    } { ( [ 12][23][31])^{{\\mathcal{n}}/4}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 describe @xmath1 sym and @xmath0 sugra , respectively .",
    "integrating @xmath63 against the @xmath64 fermionic delta functions from the three - point amplitudes in  ( [ eq:2 ] ) and inputting the replacements  ( [ eq:3 ] ) , we obtain @xmath65 this is the main formula of this section and should be compared with terms in the recursion relation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "we conclude that for @xmath2 sym , the on - shell diagram precisely corresponds to a term in the bcfw expansion , but for @xmath3 we have an additional power of @xmath66 in the numerator .",
    "hence , in both cases we can rephrase bcfw recursion in terms of a sum over on - shell diagrams , but for @xmath3 sugra the bridge needs to be supplemented by an additional @xmath67 .",
    "this is the decoration in  .",
    "hence , the recursion relation in terms of on - shell diagrams depicted in figure [ tree ] holds for any number of legs , since it is equivalent to standard bcfw recursion whose validity for @xmath0 sugra was proven in @xcite .",
    "since the recursion relation involves summing over permutations of the unshifted legs in sugra , one generally obtains non - planar on - shell diagrams .",
    "however in the recursion relation there are two special adjacent legs which are held fixed .",
    "if we always choose these two legs to be the ones which we insert into the recursion relation to obtain higher - point amplitudes , the result will always be a sum of planar planar graphs .",
    "this can be proved via a simple induction argument .",
    "assume that all @xmath68-point amplitudes for @xmath69 can be expressed as a sum over planar on - shell diagrams with two fixed adjacent external momenta .",
    "then an @xmath14-point amplitude can be obtained via the recursion relation ( as in figure  [ tree ] ) , by inserting these lower - point diagrams into a larger one . by insisting that we always use the fixed adjacent legs in each subdiagram as the ones we attach to either the bridge or the other subdiagram",
    ", we obtain the @xmath14-point amplitude as a sum over planar on - shell diagrams with two fixed adjacent external momenta and we have completed the induction argument .",
    "the structure is illustrated in the following picture which then repeats recursively :        thus any tree - level scattering amplitude can be obtained by summing _",
    "planar _ on - shell diagrams over permutations of unshifted external legs . in this way",
    ", the amplitudes of tree - level @xmath0 sugra can be associated with planar on - shell diagrams .",
    "indeed the diagrams are precisely the same as those which would appear in @xmath1 sym by recursing in a similar way .",
    "the main difference is that in sugra we sum over all permutations of the unfixed legs .",
    "a structure very reminiscent of this relation between tree - level sugra and sym was found previously in  @xcite .",
    "it is then interesting to examine what other properties of planar @xmath1 amplitudes such as a grassmannian representation and positivity can be generalized to @xmath0 supergravity .",
    "we will consider this in the next section .",
    "as an example , consider the 5-point mhv amplitude . if we restrict the recursion relation to a planar sector as described above , the result is given by a sum over six planar diagrams : @xmath70 on the other hand , if we apply a recursion in a different way , we will generically get a sum of non - planar diagrams : @xmath71 this implies nontrivial relations for non - planar diagrams of @xmath0 sugra .",
    "for example , it is straightforward to check the equivalence of the diagrams in the above two figures using the techniques we describe in the next section .",
    "in the previous section , we developed a recursion relation for tree - level @xmath0 sugra amplitudes in terms of on - shell diagrams . in this section",
    ", we will describe a systematic method for evaluating the on - shell diagrams , closely following similar methods in @xmath2 developed in  @xcite .",
    "in particular we will develop an algorithm for reading off formulae directly from the diagrams in the form of integrals over @xmath72-dimensional planes in @xmath14-dimensions , where @xmath14 and @xmath72 are the number of external legs and mhv degree , respectively .",
    "the space of @xmath72 planes in @xmath14 dimensions is known as the grassmannian @xmath73 , which also plays a prominent role in the scattering amplitudes of @xmath1 sym .",
    "our strategy will be to first write the 3-point amplitudes as grassmannian integrals and make a special choice of coordinates on the grassmannian which allow us to read off the integrands directly from the on - shell diagrams by assigning variables and arrows to the edges of the diagram .",
    "we then generalize these expressions to higher - point on - shell diagrams by gluing together 3-point vertices and deduce an algorithm for writing down formulae for general on - shell diagrams in terms of their edge variables , which can ultimately be lifted to covariant grassmannian integral formulae .",
    "the grassmanian @xmath73 can be thought of as the set of @xmath74 matrices @xmath75 modulo the left - action of @xmath76 @xmath77 equivalently this is the set of @xmath72-planes through the origin in @xmath14 dimensions , with the @xmath76 equivalence simply corresponding to the freedom of the choice of basis for the @xmath72-plane .",
    "we can then define @xmath78 is the orthogonal @xmath79 plane whose minors ( @xmath80 are determined in terms of the minors of @xmath81 ( @xmath82 via @xmath83 the natural grassmanian invariant measure can be written explicitly as @xmath84 with this measure one can choose any @xmath85 independent coordinates for @xmath73 and simply plug into the above @xmath85-form .    one can write the 3-point mhv amplitude in supergravity as an integral over the grassmannian @xmath86 as follows : @xmath87 where @xmath38 are any pair of external legs and @xmath88 is the minor obtained from columns @xmath39 and @xmath40 of the @xmath89 @xmath81-matrix .",
    "note that the delta functions ( which imply that @xmath90 is perpendicular to @xmath78 and hence parallel to @xmath81 ) imply that @xmath91 , where @xmath92 .",
    "it follows that @xmath93 so this ratio is the same for any pair of legs @xmath38 .",
    "one can verify directly that this expression is @xmath94 invariant , permutation invariant ( thanks to  ( [ eq : an ] ) ) , and gives the correct result  ( [ eq:4 ] ) on making any coordinate choice for the grassmannian , which we will see shortly . as we show in appendix [ linka ] ,",
    "can also be derived by fourier transforming the 3-point mhv amplitude in to twistor space , which gives rise to a  link representation \" and makes manifest the fact that the amplitude does not have conformal symmetry , since the angle bracket @xmath95 in is expressed in terms of an infinity twistor .    performing similar manipulations ,",
    "we obtain the following grassmannian @xmath96 integral formula for the 3-point anti - mhv amplitude : @xmath97}{\\left(ij\\right)^{\\perp}}\\label{eq:3ptmb}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 are once again any pair of external legs and @xmath98 is the minor obtained from rows @xmath39 and @xmath40 of the @xmath99 @xmath78 matrix . in this case",

    "we choose coordinates @xmath103 whereas for the white ( @xmath104 ) vertices we choose @xmath105 and we display this choice of coordinates via arrows as : @xmath106 the relations among the @xmath107 s and @xmath108 s implied by the delta functions in and can now be read off directly by following paths in the oriented diagrams . for the black node , the delta functions with this choice of @xmath81 imply that @xmath109 and @xmath110 , whereas for the white node we have @xmath111 . is not in fact perpendicular to @xmath81 ( in the euclidean sense ) with this choice .",

    "if one encounters a closed loop when summing over paths , simply sum the geometric series .",

    "the above procedure gives an expression for the on - shell diagram as a grassmannian integral in terms of specific coordinates .",

    "note that it is always possible to express the edge variables as monomials of the minors , as was first seen in the context of @xmath1 sym @xcite . for on - shell diagrams contributing to non - mhv amplitudes ,",
    "this lift will specify a nontrivial contour in the grassmannian .",
    "we describe this in more detail in the end of section [ examples ] .",
    "although the above algorithm will work in general , there are often shortcuts one can take to simplify the calculation . indeed ,",
    "if an edge of the diagram corresponds to a bcfw bridge , then the spinor brackets associated with the two vertices of this edge will be canceled by the bridge decoration ( which has the form @xmath177 ) , leaving only @xmath124 variables .",
    "we can therefore add the following rules to the above algorithm :    * there is a simple rule for bcfw bridges : @xmath178 in particular , if @xmath124 is the edge variable of the bridge and all the adjacent edges have trivial edge variables , then the bridge contributes @xmath179 . *",
    "if one uses the planar recursion relation illustrated in figure  [ planar ] , one can see that nearly all vertices are attached to bridges .",
    "indeed , for tree - level on - shell diagrams , the only vertices which are not attached to bridges are those directly attached to the @xmath180 unfixed external momenta , so we only need to include spinor brackets for these vertices when implementing step 4 of the algorithm .",
    "this observation also has important implications for on - shell diagrams containing bubbles , which should be relevant for loop - level amplitudes .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , an undecorated bubble like the one depicted in figure [ bubble ] must vanish because the spinor brackets associated with each vertex vanish . on the other hand ,",
    "if one of the internal lines is decorated then the bubble will not vanish because the decoration precisely cancels out the spinor brackets .",
    "hence , if it is possible to extend bcfw recursion for @xmath0 supergravity to loop - level , we expect this to be a general feature .",
    "+     in the next section , we illustrate this algorithm in a number of examples .",
    "in section [ recursion ] we described how to recursively compute tree - level amplitudes of @xmath0 sugra in terms of on - shell diagrams , and in section [ grassmannian ] we proposed an algorithm for computing the on - shell diagrams in terms of grassmannian integral formulae . in this section , we will put everything together and illustrate these techniques by computing four and five point amplitudes . in the end of this section",
    ", we briefly comment on how these calculations extend to higher - point and in particular non - mhv amplitudes .",
    "first we consider the following diagram contributing to the four - point tree - level amplitude :        here we have already performed the first two steps by orienting and labeling the diagram .",
    "following steps 3,4 we then have the expression @xmath181[78]\\ .\\label{eq:7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we then use the path prescription   to rewrite the internal brackets as external ones @xmath182 as well as to write all ingoing external @xmath108s in terms of outgoing ones ( and vice versa for the @xmath107 s ) yielding the @xmath81-matrix and @xmath78 matrix @xmath183 thus after step 5 we have @xmath184 ^ 2\\delta^{k(2|8)}(c \\cdot ( \\tilde    \\lambda|\\eta ) ) \\delta^{2(n - k)}(\\lambda \\cdot c^\\perp ) \\delta^{2\\times(2|8)}(c \\cdot ( \\tilde    \\lambda|\\eta ) ) \\delta^{2\\times2}(\\lambda \\cdot c^\\perp)\\ \\label{4dln}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath185 we thus obtain an expression as an integral over the grassmannian with specific coordinates . to uplift this to a covariant expression , compute all minors of @xmath81 . from",

    "transformation @xmath189 , the measure transforms with @xmath190 and the delta functions with @xmath190 , so we need 8 minors in the denominator in order to have @xmath94 invariance , and hence to have a true grassmannian integral . ]    before continuing , it is useful to look at what we would get from a different choice of perfect orientation .",

    "finally , to obtain the 4-point amplitude itself , we multiply by the bridge factor @xmath193\\right)^{-1}$ ] and sum over the permutation of legs @xmath194 and @xmath195 . using to choose the last factor in to be @xmath196 ^ 2}{(34)^2}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] dividing through by @xmath193\\right)^{-1}$ ] , and summing over the permutation of legs @xmath194 and @xmath195 we",

    "note that the edge variables of the two diagrams in figure [ square ] are nontrivially related , but the integrands are the same because of the invariance of the dlog form of the measure @xmath207 appearing in .",
    "we now move on to the next simplest example , namely five points , and apply the algorithm to read off an expression for the planar mhv on - shell diagram .",
    "we choose a perfect orientation and use the edge variables according to the diagram        we have seven internal spinor brackets ( one for each vertex ) which we rewrite in terms of external spinors as @xmath208&=[21 ] &                    [ 5\\,10]&=[54]&[13\\,9]&=\\alpha_{11}[54]&[78]&=[32]\\notag\\\\ \\langle67\\rangle&=\\alpha_6\\alpha_7\\langle13\\rangle&\\langle12\\,13\\rangle&=\\alpha_{13}\\langle13\\rangle&\\langle9\\,10\\rangle&=\\alpha_9\\alpha_{10}\\alpha_{11}\\langle31\\rangle\\ .\\label{eq:14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] inserting these we can thus write down the expression for the diagram as @xmath209^{2}\\left[12\\right]\\left[23\\right]}.\\label{eq:15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we also read off the @xmath81 matrix from the diagram @xmath210 from which we obtain the minors ( we only list those which are monomials in the @xmath124 s ) @xmath211 using the formula for the measure @xmath212 we can then uplift the above expression directly to the covariant form @xmath213^{2}\\left[12\\right]\\left[23\\right]}{(13)^{4}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( here we need 9 minors in the denominator to get @xmath214 invariance ) .    from the recursion relation in figure [ tree",

    "the bridge factors are most naturally incorporated in combination with the spinor brackets associated with the two vertices attached to each bridges .",

    "let us conclude this section with some general remarks .",
    "using induction , it is not difficult to show that an on - shell diagram contributing to an @xmath14-point tree - level amplitude will have @xmath229 internal edges and @xmath230 vertices , regardless of the mhv degree . from this , it is easy to see that the on - shell diagram will have @xmath231 independent edge variables . on the other hand ,",
    "a tree - level @xmath14-point n@xmath15mhv amplitude can be expressed as an integral over the grassmannian @xmath232 . since",
    "an element of @xmath232 has @xmath233 independent components but an @xmath14-point on - shell diagram obtained by tree - level bcfw recursion has @xmath234 independent edge variables , this means that when we lift the expression for the on - shell diagram in terms of edge variables into the grassmannian , this will specify a contour in the grassmannian of dimension @xmath235 .",
    "in this paper , we develop on - shell diagrams for @xmath0 sugra .",
    "these are built up from 3-point black and white vertices corresponding to 3-point mhv and anti - mhv amplitudes , respectively .",
    "in contrast to @xmath1 sym , when computing scattering amplitudes in @xmath0 sugra using bcfw recursion in terms of on - shell diagrams , the bcfw bridge must be decorated and we must sum over permutations of the unshifted external legs . nevertheless , it is possible to define the recursion in terms of planar on - shell diagrams , implying remarkable new identities for non - planar on - shell diagrams .",
    "moreover , the on - shell diagrams of @xmath0 sugra exhibit equivalence relations analogous to those of @xmath1 sym , such as mergers and square moves .",
    "we have also developed an algorithm for computing on - shell diagrams by assigning variables and arrows to the edges in such a way that they form a perfect orientation .",
    "this approach is rather appealing because it is very simple and is easy to automate .",
    "furthermore , it leads to a new representation of @xmath0 sugra scattering amplitudes in terms of grassmannian integral formulae .",
    "other grassmannian representations were previously deduced using twistor string theory and it would interesting to understand how they are related to our formulae .    for planar",
    "@xmath1 sym , the on - shell diagrams were shown to be in one - to - one correspondence with cells of the positive grassmannian , leading to a new interpretation of scattering amplitudes as the volume of a geometrical object known as the amplituhedron .",
    "we observe hints of similar structure in the undecorated planar on - shell diagrams of @xmath0 sugra from which the amplitudes can be derived after decorating the bcfw bridges and summing over permutations of the external legs .",
    "it would therefore be very interesting to explore the existence of an amplituhedron for @xmath0 sugra .",
    "in context of planar @xmath1 sym , the amplituhedron implied the emergence of locality and unitarity from more primitive geometrical principles .",
    "if analogous statements can be made for gravitational scattering amplitudes , this may have profound implications for quantum gravity .",
    "perhaps the most urgent question we face is whether the on - shell diagram formalism we have developed can be extended to loop - level . whereas dual conformal symmetry provides a canonical definition for the loop integrands of the planar @xmath1 sym s - matrix , it is not yet clear how to define a canonical integrand for non - planar ( and in particular gravitational ) scattering amplitudes , although recent results based on ambitwistor string theory @xcite and q - cuts @xcite suggest that it is possible to do so .",
    "moreover , bcfw recursion has been used to compute the rational contributions to loop amplitudes in gauge theory @xcite and supergravity @xcite .    for now , let us simply observe that the one - loop 4-point amplitude of @xmath0 sugra can be obtained from the on - shell diagram depicted in figure [ 1loop ] after summing over permutations of the external legs . indeed , using the rules described in section [ algorithm ]",
    ", one immediately finds that this on - shell diagram is given by        @xmath236 where the the dlogs come from the four decorated bcfw bridges , and the integrand simply corresponds to the undecorated planar 4-point on - shell diagram computed in : @xmath237^{2}}{\\left\\langle \\hat{1}\\hat{3}\\right\\rangle ^{2}}\\frac{\\delta^{4|16}(p)}{\\left\\langle \\hat{1}\\hat{2}\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle \\hat{2}\\hat{3}\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle \\hat{3}\\hat{4}\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle \\hat{4}\\hat{1}\\right\\rangle } .\\ ] ] although the on - shell diagram has eight edge variables , only half of them are independent since the @xmath81-matrix for this diagram implies the constraints @xmath238 @xmath239 which in turn imply that @xmath240 hence , the integrand can be written as a function @xmath241 , as claimed . noting that @xmath242=\\left[24\\right]$ ] and @xmath243 and dividing by the tree - level 4-point amplitude in then gives @xmath244 where @xmath245 is the scalar box integral and we have used the following identity ( which was also used in the context of planar @xmath1 sym @xcite ) : @xmath246 summing over cyclic permutations of the external legs finally gives the 1-loop 4-point amplitude @xcite : @xmath247    note that the on - shell diagram in figure [ 1loop ] is just a decorated version of the one corresponding to the 1-loop 4-point amplitude of planar @xmath1 sym , which was derived using loop - level bcfw recursion @xcite .",
    "our results therefore suggest that a similar recursion relation should exist for @xmath0 sugra , although we leave a detailed derivation for future work .",
    "another interesting feature of the supergravity calculation is the dlog form of the integrand , which is made manifest by the rules described in section [ algorithm ] .",
    "the dlog form was also observed in various other loop amplitudes of @xmath0 sugra @xcite .",
    "if it is possible to generalize our on - shell diagram formalism to loop - level , it should make this structure manifest .",
