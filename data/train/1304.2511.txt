    "the phase diagram of solutions of linear polymers and their large - scale structure ( i.e. , on the scale of the coil size ) are well understood and can be explained by invoking the physical picture of polymers in implicit solvent with effective ( solvent - mediated ) interactions among the monomers .",
    "@xcite when the number @xmath9 of monomers per chain ( degree of polymerization ) is large , such chains exhibit scale invariance , meaning that , in suitably rescaled units of density , temperature , and chain length , solutions of chemically distinct polymers and solvents obey universal scaling relations , i.e. , global properties of the solution are characterized by _",
    "universal _ exponents and scaling functions .",
    "central properties are the single - chain radius of gyration @xmath10 and the equation of state for the osmotic pressure @xmath11 . for small concentrations",
    ", @xmath11 admits the expansion@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the usual virial coefficients , and @xmath15 is the polymer density ( @xmath16 chains in a volume @xmath17 ) . the coefficients @xmath14 depend on all chemical details .",
    "on the other hand , the dimensionless ratios @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the zero - density radius of gyration ) have a universal limit , i.e. , they are independent of chemical details , for large values of @xmath9 .    scaling functions and exponents",
    "are influenced by the nature of the interactions among the monomers .",
    "three regimes can be distinguished.@xcite i ) the _ good - solvent _ regime , usually observed at high enough temperature , in which interactions are dominated by the pairwise repulsion and the single - chain size grows@xcite as @xmath20 , where @xcite @xmath21 is the flory exponent .",
    "the second virial coefficient is positive and @xcite @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "ii ) the _ @xmath1-regime _ at lower temperature , in which the repulsive and attractive contributions in the two - body and three - body effective interactions are vanishingly small and of the same order of magnitude . in the scaling limit @xmath24 , this regime collapses to a single temperature @xmath25 , called @xmath1 temperature . at @xmath26 chains",
    "are gaussian ( ideal ) with scaling exponent @xmath27 and the second virial combination @xmath28 vanishes .",
    "however , for linear chains of finite length , as is the case in experiments and computer simulations , this regime is observed in a temperature interval around @xmath29 of the order of @xmath30 . in analogy with the dilute - gas case ,",
    "one often defines the  boyle \" temperature @xmath31 , as the value of @xmath32 at which the second virial coefficient @xmath33 vanishes .",
    "@xmath31 is generally larger then @xmath25 , converges to @xmath29 as @xmath23 [ @xmath34 , and is sometimes used to estimate @xmath25 numerically.@xcite iii ) at even lower temperatures the two - body effective interactions become predominantly attractive ( negative second virial coefficient ) , the chains are segregated by the solvent and below a critical temperature @xmath35 the solution separates in a chain - poor solution where chains are in the collapsed state , and a solvent - poor solution where the chain statistics approaches the one in the melt state ( ideal at large scales ) .",
    "again , in the scaling limit @xmath24 the critical temperature @xmath35 tends to @xmath25 .",
    "@xcite    c +    for finite values of @xmath9 , a gradual transition between the good- and @xmath1-solvent regimes is observed , i.e. , the observables and their associated scaling functions interpolate smoothly between the two universal behaviors .",
    "a sketch of the various regimes in the phase diagram of polymers of finite length is shown in figure [ fig:1 ] . at low polymer concentration , i.e. , for @xmath36 , when increasing the temperature above the @xmath1 point , the coil size is observed to behave as @xmath20 with an apparent exponent that increases from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "analogously , the second virial combination @xmath28 varies smoothly in the range @xmath39 , with the value 5.5 ( plus finite @xmath9 corrections ) obtained in the fully developed good - solvent regime .",
    "@xcite at larger polymer concentrations and for any @xmath40 , a region where 2-body and 3-body terms are of the same order of magnitude is present and is generically referred as",
    "_ tricritical region_. for small concentrations this region extends in a small temperature interval @xcite whose width is of the order of @xmath30 ( more precisely , it scales as @xmath41 ) .",
    "as the concentration @xmath42 increases , this region widens as @xmath43 . in the tricritical region",
    "scaling corrections decay very slowly , as inverse powers of @xmath44.@xcite outside the tricritical region the physics is again dominated by two - body effects and by the unbalance between the short - range repulsion and the long - range attraction , as it was shown by computer simulations of physical polymer models.@xcite here we refer to the _ thermal crossover region _ , as the region in the phase diagram between the tricritical and good - solvent regimes . at finite concentration , scaling arguments@xcite indicate that the size of the thermal crossover region grows with @xmath42 as @xmath45 . at sufficiently large temperatures ,",
    "the good - solvent regime is reached at any concentration .    in the thermal crossover region",
    "there are experimental and computer - simulation evidences that , for sufficiently large values of @xmath9 , global properties of the solution follow , up to small corrections in @xmath46 , and @xmath9 , general relations of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the expression of @xmath49 for the gaussian chain , the function @xmath50 is called _ crossover _ function , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are nonuniversal constants that embody all chemical details .",
    "theory@xcite supports the scaling behavior ( [ scaling - gen ] ) , albeit with a slightly different scaling variable .",
    "indeed , the crossover limit should be taken by keeping @xmath54 fixed , which differs by a power of @xmath55 from the scaling variable @xmath56 which appears in eq .",
    "( [ scaling - gen ] ) .",
    "such a logarithmic dependence is irrelevant in all practical applications , since the observation of this slowly varying term would require data in a very large interval of polymer lengths / molecular weights . by varying",
    "@xmath57 one obtains the full crossover behavior , from the tricritical region , corresponding to small values of @xmath57 , to the good - solvent regime , which is obtained for @xmath58 .",
    "it is important to note that the nontrivial universal behavior is obtained when taking simultaneously the limits @xmath24 and @xmath59 in such a way that the arguments of the crossover function @xmath50 , @xmath60 and @xmath5 , remain constant .",
    "if the limits are taken differently , one would obtain a different result .",
    "for instance , if one takes the limit @xmath23 at fixed @xmath61 , one would obtain good - solvent behavior in all cases , while , if one decreases @xmath32 towards @xmath29 at fixed large @xmath9 , only the tricritical behavior would be observed . a similar variety of universal scaling behaviors , which depend on how the limit @xmath23 is taken , is found in the stretched - chain problem.@xcite    the variable @xmath57 that parametrizes the temperature crossover depends on the nonuniversal parameter @xmath53",
    ", hence a proper definition requires specifying a physically meaningful normalization condition . to avoid this problem",
    ", one can proceed as suggested in refs .",
    ", i.e. , one can parametrize the crossover in terms of a physical variable rather than in terms of @xmath57 . for instance , one can use the dimensionless second - virial combination @xmath28 . then , eq .",
    "( [ scaling - gen ] ) can be written as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is universal .",
    "the _ quality _ of the solution is now characterized by @xmath28 that varies between zero at the @xmath1 point and @xmath64 , the good - solvent value .",
    "@xcite in the thermal crossover region the relation between @xmath57 and @xmath28 has been obtained combining analytical results and monte carlo simulations , @xcite obtaining @xmath65 where @xmath57 has been normalized so that @xmath66 for small @xmath57 , i.e. ,  @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the so - called interpenetration ratio , which is commonly used in much of the experimental literature .",
    "as discussed by sokal,@xcite the universal scaling functions that parametrize the thermal crossover coincide with the crossover functions that are defined in the two - parameters model ( tpm),@xcite which considers only repulsive two - body monomer - monomer interactions . in this framework",
    "the scaling variable @xmath57 is identified with the usual zimm - stockmayer - fixmann variable.@xcite therefore , to determine the leading crossover behavior , it is convenient to work in the tpm framework , which provides directly the crossover functions .",
    "this is the approach we have taken in this paper , using the lattice domb - joyce model , @xcite which is the lattice version of the continuum tpm , to obtain the crossover functions , both in the dilute and in the semidilute regime .",
    "although the physics of homogenous polymer solutions is well understood , in more complex situations  for instance , inhomogeneous cases or when the polymers are only a single component of a more complex system  it might be important to reduce the number of degrees of freedom representing the polymer subsystem or , equivalently , to limit our interest to the physics occurring at a length scale comparable to the polymer size . in these cases adopting",
    "a coarse - grained ( cg ) representation of the solution might be essential for the feasibility of the numerical investigation .",
    "moreover , since the target properties on which the coarse - grained model ( cgm ) is built can be determined in the scaling limit @xmath23 , cgms allow one to study thermodynamics and structural properties in the universal , scaling limit without requiring additional extrapolations .",
    "several routes to cgms can be adopted . in the structure - based route @xcite the cgm",
    "is set up in such a way to reproduce the marginal probability distribution of a set of chosen structural collective variables .",
    "this procedure , however , does not predict the correct thermodynamics of the underlying solution .",
    "conversely , a cgm can be defined to match the thermodynamic behavior , but then structural properties are not reproduced correctly.@xcite a third method is the force - matching approach ( often called multiscale coarse - graining method @xcite ) , in which the state - dependent pair - wise potential is determined by requiring the cg system to match the atomistic force on the cg atoms as accurately as possible .",
    "also this method has a structural interpretation:@xcite the matching condition is equivalent to require the cg force to satisfy the appropriate yvon - born - green equation that relates the pair and the three - body correlation function .",
    "however , no guarantee of reproducing the pair structure and the thermodynamics is provided .",
    "the inconsistency between structure and thermodynamics stems from the fact that cgms neglect multi - body interactions , which would be required to obtain an exact mapping of the microscopic model onto the cgm .",
    "recently , we have introduced a procedure to set up a hierarchy of cgms for linear chains in good - solvent conditions which simultaneously reproduce quite accurately structure and thermodynamics of polymer solutions deep into the semidilute regime.@xcite the minimal model consists in representing each linear chain by a short polyatomic molecule with four cg sites ( tetramer ) .",
    "the tetramer potentials are set up at zero density  this allows us to avoid the inconsistencies@xcite that occur when using state - dependent potentials  by matching the single - chain intramolecular structure and the center - of - mass pair correlation function between two identical chains . the minimal representation ( tetramer )",
    "has been shown to provide accurate results for the underlying solutions up to @xmath69.@xcite larger values of @xmath5 can be accessed by increasing the resolution of the cgm , i.e. by increasing the number of effective monomers ( blobs ) per chain .",
    "the effective potentials for these higher - resolution models are obtained by using a simple transferability approach .",
    "we assume that the potentials are independent of the number of blobs , as long as all lengths are expressed in terms of the blob radius of gyration .",
    "this transferability approximation was shown to be quite accurate@xcite and allowed us to obtain accurate thermodynamic and ( large - scale ) structural results for @xmath70 .    in this paper",
    "we present the extension of this cg strategy to solutions in the thermal crossover region , defining cgms with @xmath57-dependent potentials that reproduce the polymer crossover functions .",
    "we have considered the tpm as the underlying microscopic model , using the lattice domb - joyce ( dj ) model@xcite as reference system . as in the good - solvent case , we first determine the effective interactions for the tetramer case for several values of @xmath57 in the crossover region , by matching structural properties at zero density . these potentials",
    "are then used to define cgms of higher resolutions , i.e. , higher number of cg sites .",
    "the transferability approach is more complex than in the good - solvent case , since one must change at the same time the reference length scale and the scaling variable @xmath57 .",
    "we perform extensive simulations of the cgms at finite density , both in the dilute and in the semidilute region .",
    "the results are then compared with those obtained in full - monomer ( fm ) simulations and with the field - theory predictions of ref .  .",
    "we find that the tetramer cgm reproduces very accurately the crossover functions up to @xmath71 ( and quite reasonably at all densities ) for small values of @xmath57 .",
    "close to the good - solvent behavior , instead accurate results are obtained up to @xmath7 .",
    "use of the decamer model with @xmath8 blobs allows one to widen significantly the density region in which the cgm is predictive .",
    "the present work represents an important extension of our previous results , allowing us to consider polymer systems in the thermal crossover regime . in particular",
    ", it opens the way to the study of more complex systems like polymer - colloid solutions away from the good - solvent regime and diblock copolymer solutions,@xcite where each block has different affinity with the solvent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we define the dj model we have adopted and explain how the crossover functions are computed .",
    "in section [ sec3 ] we present our cg strategy , first illustrating the cg representation ( cgr ) of the fm chain ( section [ sec3.1 ] ) and later presenting our cgm ( section [ sec3.2 ] ) .",
    "section [ sec4 ] is devoted to the comparison between the results of the cgr of the fm system and of the cgm , first at zero density ( section [ sec4.1 ] ) and then at finite density in the semidilute regime ( section [ sec4.3 ] ) .",
    "simulation results are also compared with field - theoretical expressions@xcite and large - density predictions obtained by using the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , which becomes exact for @xmath72 . in section [ sec5 ] , the transferability of the tetramer potentials to finer resolution models",
    "is illustrated and validated against fm predictions .",
    "finally , section [ sec6 ] reports our conclusions .",
    "two appendices are also present . in appendix [ app.a ]",
    "we report the calculation of the blob radius of gyration in the crossover regime , while in appendix [ app.b ] we summarize the field - theory predictions of ref .  .",
    "some numerical details and explicit expressions for the cgm potentials can be found in the supplementary material.@xcite",
    "in order to compute the tpm crossover functions , we consider the three - dimensional lattice domb - joyce ( dj ) model.@xcite in this model the polymer solution is mapped onto @xmath16 chains of @xmath9 monomers each on a cubic lattice of linear size @xmath73 with periodic boundary conditions",
    ". each polymer chain is modelled by a random walk @xmath74 with @xmath75 ( we take the lattice spacing as unit of length ) and @xmath76 .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the kronecker delta .",
    "each configuration is weighted by @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is a free parameter that plays the role of inverse temperature .",
    "this model is similar to the standard lattice self - avoiding walk ( saw ) model,@xcite which is obtained in the limit @xmath81 . for finite positive @xmath82 intersections",
    "are possible although energetically penalized . for any positive @xmath82",
    ", this model has the same scaling limit as the saw model@xcite and thus allows us to compute the universal scaling functions that are relevant for polymer solutions under good - solvent conditions .",
    "the tpm results in the thermal crossover region can also be derived from simulations of the dj model .",
    "they are obtained@xcite by taking the limit @xmath83 , @xmath23 at fixed @xmath84 .",
    "the variable @xmath85 interpolates between the ideal - chain limit ( @xmath86 ) and the good - solvent limit ( @xmath87 ) . indeed , for @xmath88",
    "the dj model is simply the random - walk model , while for any @xmath89 and @xmath23 one always obtains the good - solvent scaling behavior .",
