    "recent advances @xcite in coherent femtosecond nonlinear spectroscopy have shown evidence of long - lived coherences in photosynthetic systems . however , in nature biological systems are exposed to incoherent sources of light , such as sunlight , as opposed to coherent femtosecond sources .",
    "therefore , an understanding of excitation under incoherent conditions is crucial . in such cases , the _ long time _",
    "result of incoherent irradiation , using both quantum and classical light , leads to a mixed state of the system @xcite , a result discussed further in the literature in the context of photosynthetic light harvesting complexes @xcite .",
    "however , work has been done , for example , on incoherent or noisy perturbations in quantum optics where some have found that incoherent or noisy electric fields can generate transient coherences in three level atoms @xcite .",
    "hence , understanding the approach to the mixed state , and its dependence on system parameters is important , and is the subject of this paper .    here ,",
    "transient excited state coherences manifest upon the perturbative sudden turn - on irradiation of an isolated quantum system are discussed and examined in a v level system .",
    "these coherences are shown to become negligible in the long time limit relative to the populations so that the system approaches , in this way , a mixed state .",
    "the dynamics of long and noisy pulses incident on generic systems is also investigated .",
    "these pulses induce coherences on a time scale dependent on the excited state period and the pulse duration .",
    "however , after the pulse is over these coherences become damped and irrelevant relative to the magnitude of populations . in both cases ,",
    "the magnitude of the spacing between the excited levels is shown to play an important role .",
    "further , in both cases , the approach to the mixed state is dramatically different than that associated with decoherence experienced by a prepared superposition state that is in contact with a thermal bath ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we consider the response of a system to two sample sources of incoherent light .",
    "the first models incoherent light corresponding to a collisionally broadened cw source @xcite that is turned on abruptly .",
    "this incoherent light source is characterized by a two time correlation function @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the frequency center of the radiation , and @xmath3 is the field intensity .",
    "the coherence time of this radiation is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath6 is temperature @xcite .",
    "hence , a room temperature source at @xmath7 gives @xmath8 fs whereas a source with @xmath9 k , gives @xmath10 fs .",
    "this corresponds to a classical model of incoherent light ; the full quantum version has qualitatively similar behavior to the correlation function in eq .",
    "( [ corr1 ] ) at these temperatures @xcite .",
    "a second source examined below is a noisy pulse , a gaussian pulse with a phase jitter designed to model an incoherent light pulse , given by @xcite :    @xmath11    natural processes experiencing incoherent light can be modeled using eq .",
    "( [ corr2 ] ) with the pulse duration @xmath12 being much larger than the coherence parameter , @xmath13 . in this limit",
    "( [ corr2 ] ) behaves like eq .",
    "( [ corr1 ] ) , but with a smooth turn - on of the field .",
    "the attractiveness of using a long incoherent pulse is two fold : ( 1 ) it has no sudden `` turn - on effect '' that leads to artificial initial coherence , and ( 2 ) it offers a reasonable long time result which models radiation induced decoherence @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the pulsed scenario , there are three time scales of interest : @xmath13 the pulse coherence time , @xmath12 the pulse duration , and @xmath14 the characteristic time scale of the system , usually equal to the inverse of the level spacing . in the simulations below",
    "we assume that the pulse duration @xmath15 is much longer than both @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "in addition since , in a natural environment , the system is initially in a stationary mixed state , we consider the light to be incident on a single molecular eigenstate , i.e. a representative element of the ensemble .",
    "finally , note that both eqs .",
    "( [ corr1 ] ) and ( [ corr2 ] ) are broadened about a single frequency @xmath2 .",
    "typical natural light , however , is a mixture of different @xmath2 values .    below we consider both analytic first order perturbation theory results as well as numerical results for these cases . in the numerical implementation , the correlation functions [ eqs .",
    "( [ corr1 ] ) and ( [ corr2 ] ) ] are produced as averages over many individual realizations built from a wiener process ( see appendix a ) , i.e. , electric fields @xmath18 with suitable distribution of jumps in phase @xcite .",
    "specifically , the collisionally broadened cw source is reproduced by perturbing a classical oscillator s frequency with wiener noise .",
    "the noisy pulse is generated in a similar fashion , except that a gaussian envelope is placed over the noisy oscillator .",
    "a remark is in order with respect to this approach .",
    "physically , the meaningful quantity is the molecular density matrix that arises from the effect of the ensemble of electric fields that satisfy the statistics in eqs .",
    "( [ corr1 ] ) and ( [ corr2 ] ) .",
    "such electric field statistics can arise from a wide variety of different types of realizations .",
    "for example , it has been suggested that coherent fs pulses may be a meaningful basis from which to build such realizations @xcite .",
    "to do so requires that the pulses be added together _ incoherently _ casting doubt on the relevance of the coherence observed in any single realization .",
    "in addition , such a fs basis , unlike our choice of phase interruptions to a cw source , has no physical justification .",

    "absent from this treatment was the dynamics by which this came about , which is the subject of this section .",
    "note that given the weakness of natural light ( such as sunlight ) a first - order perturbative treatment is applicable .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system and radiation is given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the dipole operator and @xmath18 is the electric field .",
    "using the standard dipole approximation and treating the light - molecule interaction to first order gives the following expression @xcite for the excited state density matrix :    @xmath21    here , the time independent coefficients @xmath22 are given by @xmath23 where the @xmath24 are the energy eigenstates of the system at energy @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the frequency difference between the @xmath27th state and the ground state .",
    "the initial condition has the system in the ground state , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "equation ( [ den1 ] ) has been obtained assuming that the ensemble average over the product of the electric fields and the time integrals commute .",

    "for the collisionally broadened cw source , we insert eq .",
    "( [ corr1 ] ) for @xmath29 into eq .",
    "( [ den1 ] ) and compute the two time integrals .",
    "the integral can be written as four distinct terms , so that the excited state density matrix is :    @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    for simplicity , we have set @xmath35 ; averaging over @xmath36 is discussed in appendix b. here , @xmath37 gives the detuning of the @xmath38 transition frequency from the central laser frequency , and @xmath39 is a lorentzian that is dependent on the detuning and on the coherence parameter @xmath16 .",

    ", @xmath48 is a term that contributes significantly to the populations as time increases .",
    "specifically , in the limit of @xmath49 , @xmath50 alternatively , this result can be obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ den1 ] ) in the limit of @xmath51 .    by examining eqs .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) - ( [ eta3 ] ) after a time , @xmath52 , one sees that the contributions from the @xmath53 are either negligible or oscillate on a time scale of the inverse of the level spacing , similar to the @xmath40 term .",
    "as the system evolves , the populations grow at a constant rate , while the amplitude of the coherence become fixed ( but non - zero ) after time @xmath13 .",
    "this implies that at some long time ( @xmath54 ) , the populations become extremely large relative to coherences , i.e. it is in this way that the system reaches a mixed state .",
    "it also indicates that at long times the off - diagonal elements @xmath55 of @xmath56 are usually small but non - zero .",
    "indeed , since the magnitude of @xmath57 is inversely proportional to @xmath58 , nearby levels can display large coherences .",
    "these off - diagonal elements are a direct reflection of the open nature of the quantum system ; that the system is coupled to the radiative bath , resulting in a system - bath coupling that leads to a non - diagonal system density matrix in the original system energy basis @xcite .",

    "@xcite , i.e. , the system is found in a mixed state at long times .",
    "issues of the introduction of a specific laser turn - on time are discussed in appendix b where averaging over turn - on time @xmath59 is shown not to eliminate the small coherences encountered in this approach .",
    "in addition , appendix b discusses conditions under which the long time @xmath55 are maximal ( but still vanishingly small compared to the populations ) .",
    "these results indicate ( 1 ) the nature of the closed system transient coherent response to the sudden turn - on of an incoherent field , ( 2 ) the linearity of the population growth due to the diffusion process underlying the radiation field , ( 3 ) that the coherences so induced do survive as time evolves , but ( 4 ) that populations become much larger than the coherences , so that the system effectively approaches a mixed state .",

    "the decoherence is significantly less than when @xmath14 is considerably smaller than @xmath12 .",

    "qualitatively , the @xmath15 dependence arises from the fact that the longer the pulse is on , the larger the population in the excited levels .",
    "as noted earlier in @xcite molecules irradiated by pulses with smooth envelopes , even if there are phase jumps , pick up coherence from the smooth pulse envelope .",
    "hence , results are expected to differ for models that employ , e.g. , erratic pulse amplitudes .",
    "both cases show that the mixed state comes about in a fashion distinctly different than that in scenarios typically used to explore decoherence ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in those cases",
    "the effect of an environment on an initial superposition state , with no external driving field , shows a characteristic decay of coherences , i.e. the decay of off - diagonal @xmath55 of the system density matrix . in the case",
    "studied here , these off - diagonal elements do not decay , but the ratio of these elements to the populations decrease as time goes on , since the populations increase due to the external driving field .",
    "interestingly , despite these differences , the two scenarios do share the common feature , i.e. that the approach to a mixed state is slower for smaller level spacings , i.e. , large @xmath17 .",
    "hence , extended studies on incoherent light excitation in dense vibronic manifolds in large molecules is certainly well motivated , and is underway@xcite .    the fact that , in both sudden turn - on and pulsed cases , larger @xmath17 enhances coherence times indicates the need to consider decoherence effects of the environment , if the system is open .",
    "such environmental decoherence effects may well serve as the dominant decoherence effect ( as opposed to the effect of the incoherent light ) for systems with large @xmath17 , a resultant consistent with some earlier considerations @xcite in a different context .",
