    "@xcite the suppression of the magnetic order in weak transition - metal magnets as function of temperature at ambient pressure is essentially driven by a broadening of the density of states ( dos ) due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "although hydrostatic pressure also acts to broaden the dos via increased @xmath142-electron overlap , this transition in discontinuous , i.e. , temperature and pressure suppress the magnetic order in a different fashion .",
    "in contrast , the suppression of the easy - axis magnetization of cesi@xmath0 under temperature and pressure shows a remarkable similarity .",
    "in particular , the continuous suppression of the ordered magnetic moment appears to suggest that cesi@xmath0 is the first example of a genuine ferromagnetic quantum critical point .",
    "however , four features in our magnetization data clearly establish that the magnetic state at ambient pressure and low temperatures is not that of a pure ferromagnet .",
    "these features are : ( i ) a broad maximum in the ordered magnetic moment at @xmath73k , ( ii ) , the emergence of an additional shoulder in the low - field magnetization below @xmath143 , ( iii ) the presence of metamagnetism at @xmath138 t , and ( iv ) a broad maximum at a low pressure around @xmath128kbar . in this respect , the role of si deficiencies has to be considered .",
    "detailed four - circle @xmath61-ray diffraction studies of the crystallographic structure of samples from the same section of the ingot where the magnetization samples were cut has suggested an incommensurate superstructure of the si vacancies . @xcite as mentioned above , neutron scattering experiments do not confirm this superstructure and suggest that it may be a surface property .",
    "@xcite    since all investigated ferromagnets exhibit a first - order transition when @xmath49 approaches absolute zero , cesi@xmath0 , appears at first sight as an exception .",
    "however , a possible first - order transition in this material might be smeared due to the si lattice disorder .",
    "the deviation from simple ferromagnetic behavior as described by the four features mentioned above may be due to an incommensurability of the fermi surface introduced by the strain fields of an incommensurate structural modulation",
    ". it may alternatively be due to variations of the magnetic moments of the ce atoms from a local - moment point of view , that are introduced by incommensurate variations of the crystalline environment surrounding the ce sites , keeping in mind that the kondo effect arises essentially from the coupling of ce 4f moments to the conduction - electron `` configuration '' in the local environment around a given ce atom .",
    "a possible metamagnetic transition induced by a magnetic field might also play a role .",
    "an additional effect may be a change of the local crystalline electric field field . in either case , fermi - surface effect or local - environment picture ,",
    "the density of states near the fermi level is expected to display a complex structure that is clearly outside present - day models of pure ferromagnets .    by the same token",
    ", the effect of pressure in cesi@xmath0 may be considerably more complex than just inducing a broadening of the conduction bands and associated suppression of the dos near the fermi level that leads to a reduction of @xmath49 , as in weak transition - metal ferromagnets .",
    "furthermore the proximity of the nonmagnetic @xmath12-thsi@xmath7 phase has to be considered .",
    "however , the nonmagnetic @xmath12-thsi@xmath7 at large si concentrations @xmath61 has a larger volume than the magnetically ordered @xmath12-gdsi@xmath7 phase found for smaller @xmath61 .",
    "therefore it is unlikely that pressure induces a structural change toward the nonmagnetic @xmath12-thsi@xmath7 phase .",
    "the incommensurate structural modulation also implies the presence of a modulation in the response to pressure and the build - up of inhomogeneous strains within the sample .",
    "these internal concomitant strains may lead to smearing of the ferromagnetism and a suppression that is not accompanied by non - linearities in the magnetic - field dependence .",
    "we have studied the easy - axis magnetization of cesi@xmath0 as function of temperature and pressure .",
    "the qualitative similarity of the temperature dependence at ambient pressure with the pressure dependence at low temperatures suggests that cesi@xmath0 may be the first compound where a ferromagnetic quantum critical point may be induced by hydrostatic pressure . however , the presence of an additional magnetic modulation at low temperatures and ambient pressure and the observation of a possible incommensurate superstructure of the si vacancies questions a straightforward interpretation in terms of quantum criticality in pure ferromagnets .",
    "clearly , elastic neutron scattering , also under hydrostatic pressure , currently under way @xcite , is needed to disentangle the possible antiferromagnetic component which may be operative in this system , and its relation to the structure properties .",
