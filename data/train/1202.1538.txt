    "colors and variability of small bodies in the outer solar system provide insight into the physical properties and evolution of these objects .",
    "the colors of these objects are believed to be related to evolutionary processes such as collisions , resurfacing and the interaction of cosmic rays with the surface of these bodies ( e.g. , cooper et al .",
    "2003 ; see however porter et al .",
    "2010 ) . the large body of color observations of trans neptunian object ( tnos ; e.g. , luu & jewitt 1996 ; delsanti et al . 2001 ; hainaut & delsanti 2002 ; trujillo & brown 2002 ; tegler & romanishin 2003 ; almeida et al .",

    "2009 ; romanishin et al .",
    "2010 ; sheppard 2010 ) is not entirely consistent with theoretical ideas ( see the review in jewitt , morbidelli & rauer 2008 ) . the main characteristic of tno colors is diversity . to date",
    ", the only secure correlation involving tno colors is between the @xmath5 color and the orbital inclination of classical kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) and scattered disk objects ( e.g. , hainaut & delsanti 2002 ; trujillo & brown 2002 ; peixinho et al .",
    "i note that the reported correlations between the inclination and @xmath6 or @xmath7 colors remain controversial ( e.g. , stephens et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "kbo variability is related to shape , binarity and albedo surface uniformity .",
    "measuring the binary frequency allows of testing models of kbo binary formation ( e.g. goldreich , lithwick & sari 2002 ; weidenschilling 2002 ) .",
    "moreover , in some cases binaries are used to determine masses ( e.g. , noll et al .",
    "2004 ) and densities ( e.g. , sheppard & jewitt 2004 ; gnat & sari 2010 ) of kbos .    tno variability studies typically require medium size telescopes and are therefore observationally demanding . the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) provides imaging in the @xmath8-bands of a considerable fraction of the celestial sphere .",
    "the photometric calibration of the sdss is good to @xmath9% in the @xmath10 bands and @xmath11% in the @xmath12 band ( e.g. , tucker et al .",
    "2006 ; padmanabhan et al .",
    "the sdss astrometric accuracy is @xmath13 ( e.g. , pier et al . 2003 ) .",
    "however , given the short time interval within which the sdss images were obtained ( @xmath14min ) , it does not allow in most cases the detection of kbo motion in 5min ] .",

    "however , in the fourth release of this catalog ( sdssmoc4 ) there are only 33 entries of known objects with @xmath15 au .    here",
    "i describe a search for known small objects in the outer parts of the solar system in the existing sdss imaging data .",
    "a compilation of the photometric and astrometric properties of these bodies are presented and analyzed .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ db ] i describe the catalog of sdss observations of outer solar - system objects . in ",
    "[ color ] i discuss their colors , while in  [ var ] i describe their variability properties .",
    "finally , i summarize the results in  [ sum ] .",
    "this section describes the construction of a catalog of sdss observations of known outer solar - system objects with semi - major axes @xmath15au .",
    "i retrieved a list of the orbital elements of all known ( numbered and unnumbered ) minor planets in the solar system from the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) horizons system ( updated for 2010 august 2 ) .",
    "then , i selected all the objects with semi - major axis @xmath15au .",
    "this list contains 1469 bodies .",
    "i used the sdss ( york et al .",
    "2000 ) casjobs utility to generate a catalog of all the images which are available in the sdss database . here ,",
    "an `` image '' is defined uniquely by the sdss run , rerun , camcol ( camera column ) , and field .",
    "the catalog contains all the images included in the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ) , segue , and stripe 82 ( abazajian et al .",
    "2009 ) . for each image",
    "i obtained the time at which it was observed and i calculated the coordinates of its four corners .",
    "next , i used the jpl horizons system to generate daily ephemerides for each of the 1469 objects between julian day ( jd ) 2451070 and 2454467 .",
    "this jd range contains all the sdss observations in dr7 . for each entry in the daily ephemerides of each object i checked",
    "whether it is contained within any of the polygons defining the corners of all the sdss images taken within one day of the ephemeris entry .",
    "if a match was found , then the object ephemeris was re - generated for the exact time at which the image was taken ( to an accuracy of 1min ) . in total , 4642 possible observations of 574 outer solar - system objects were found .",
    "of these 845 entries are of objects with a predicted @xmath16-band magnitude , at the time of observation , brighter than @xmath17mag .",
    "next , i searched for sources in the sdss images near the predicted position of the outer solar - system objects . unlike `` typical '' minor planet surveys , this method only yields a single image per object per field , so one can not use the motion of the object between two images of the same field to verify whether it is indeed a solar - system object ( rather then a variable star or a transient )",
    "therefore , as described below , i exercised great care to remove false identifications or contamination by nearby sources .    for each entry in the catalog of sdss images possibly containing an observation of a solar - system object with a predicted magnitude brighter than @xmath18 (  [ i m ] ) , i downloaded the sdss source catalog corresponding to that image",
    ". then i searched for all the sdss sources within @xmath19 of the predicted position of the object .",
    "figure  [ fig : tno_distdist ] shows the distribution of the angular separations between the predicted object position and the nearest sdss source .     of the predicted position of the object .",
    "[ fig : tno_distdist],width=321 ]    in order to remove photometric measurements contaminated by nearby sources and possible false detections , i selected only sources which have exactly one sdss match within @xmath19 of the outer solar - system object predicted position .",
    "i further demanded that this sdss source is within @xmath20 from the predicted position of the object .",
    "moreover , i selected only sources for which there are no usno - b1 ( monet et al .",
    "2003 ) objects within @xmath19 from the position of the sdss matched source . finally , i removed from the list of sdss matches entries with @xmath21-band magnitude errors larger than 0.2mag .",
    "the final list contains 388 probable identifications of 42 unique outer solar - system objects in sdss images .",
    "each of these objects has between 1 and 49 measurements .",
    "table  [ table_ast_perobstno ] presents the astrometric properties of the 388 identifications , while table  [ table_phot_perobstno ] lists all the predicted and measured photometry .",

    "such a correlation is that closer objects are visible also on larger phase angles , whereas further objects are visible only near @xmath143 . since in reality",
    "the derivative of the absolute - magnitude phase - angle relation increases ( in absolute value ) near opposition , this may introduce the observed anti - correlation between the slope parameter and the semi - major axis .",

    "i also note that this selection bias should mostly induce a correlation with @xmath66 rather than with @xmath63 or @xmath67 , since objects with smaller @xmath66 are easier to detect .",
    "another possible caveat is that for three objects i find negative @xmath4-band slope parameters ( see table  [ table_meanslope ] ) presumably affected by measurement errors and/or variability .",
    "therefore , more observations are required in order to confirm the existence of such a correlation .",
    "if this correlation is real , then there are several possible explanations : ( i ) the regolith or surface composition properties of tnos vary with distance from the sun ; or ( ii ) `` sedna''-like objects have distinctive surface properties which are related to their origin .",
    "the variation in surface properties as a function of distance from the sun can originate , for example , if there are variations in the impact rate with micro - meteoroids as a function of heliocentric distance , or due to the crystallization properties of some ices . based on the voyager - i and ii spacecraft measurements , gurnett et al .",
    "( 2005 ) argued that the number density of dust particles , as a function of heliocentric distance , is roughly uniform ( up to distance of about 100au ) .",
    "since the typical orbital speed of objects at 90au is 0.6 of that of objects at 30au from the sun , this implies that the micro - meteoroids impact rate does  not change dramatically for objects in my sample .",
    "as different ices freeze at different temperatures , the surface properties may also be affected by the equilibrium temperaturek , where @xmath145 is the object s geometric albedo and @xmath36 is its distance from the sun . ] and escape velocity from the object ( e.g. , schaller & brown 2007 ) . for an albedo of @xmath146 , the equilibrium temperature varies between about 50k at 30au from the sun to 29k at a heliocentric distance of about 90au",
    ". however , the three `` sedna''-like objects shown in the right - hand side of figure  [ fig : slope_g_a ] are 145451 , 145480 and 2004 pg115 . during the sdss observations , these objects were near perihelion at distances of 35 , 46 and 36au from the sun , respectively .",
    "therefore , their actual equilibrium temperature , at the time of observations , were similar to those of some of the other objects in figure  [ fig : slope_g_a ] .",
    "i conclude that differences in surface properties induced by the current orbit of these objects are unlikely .",
    "however , i can not rule out that `` sedna''-like objects have a different origin than some of the other classes of tnos .",
    "i note that schaefer et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found a significant correlation between the slope parameter ( near phase angle of @xmath144deg ) and the @xmath5 color index and also a possible excluded region in the slope parameter vs. inclination phase space .",
    "i do  not find any indication for such correlations .",
    "however , the schaefer et al . ( 2009 ) sample is larger ( 35 objects ) and contains more diverse planetary objects including the largest kbos .",
    "table  [ table_meanphotprop ] and figure  [ fig : tno_r_beta ] suggest that some of the objects in the catalog presented here are variable .",
    "the variability of these sources may be the result of one or more of the following reasons : small minor planets , probably with radii smaller than @xmath147 km , may have irregular shapes and therefore are variable .",
    "moreover , tnos may show variations due to inhomogeneous surfaces .",
    "alternatively , fast rotation of objects held by their own gravity ( i.e. , radii larger than @xmath147 km ) may induce a highly non - spherical equilibrium configuration and therefore large amplitude variations ( e.g. , leone et al .",
