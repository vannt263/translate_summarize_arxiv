    "in the classical model of a random graph ( erds and rnyi @xcite ) we add random edges to an empty graph , all at once or one at a time , and then ask for the probability that certain structures occur . at the present time , this model and its variants , have generated a vast number of research papers and at least two excellent books , bollobs @xcite and janson , uczak and ruciski @xcite .",
