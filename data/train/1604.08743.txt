    "one in eight human deaths is caused by cancer .",
    "cancer stands out among diseases for it stems from somatic alterations in the genome .",
    "one common type of somatic alterations found in cancer is due to single nucleotide variations ( snvs ) or alterations to single bases in the genome .",
    "these snvs are accumulated throughout the lifetime of the cancer via exposures to different mutational processes .",
    "these processes can be endogenous to the cell such as imperfect dna replication during cell division or spontaneous cytosine deamination @xcite , @xcite",
    ". they can also be exogenous due to exposures to chemical insults or ultraviolet radiation @xcite , @xcite .",
    "all of these mutational processes , whether extrinsic or intrinsic , will leave evidence of their activity in the cancer genome characterized by distinctive alteration patterns or mutational signatures . from a knowledge standpoint ,",
    "if one can identify all signatures and thus all mutational processes contributing to cancer , then one can begin to understand the origins of cancer and its development . from a therapeutic point of view , if there are no discernible patterns of mutations between different cancer types , then different cancers will mostly likely require their own type - specific or even patient - specific therapeutics .",
    "however , if there is a much smaller number of mutational signatures describing all or most cancer types , then a therapeutic for one cancer type with certain mutational signatures present may very well be applicable across other cancer types with the same or similar mutational signatures .    at present",
    ", the identification of mutational signatures involves analyzing snv patterns present in a cohort of dna sequenced whole cancer genomes .",
    "snvs found in each cancer genome can be classified into 96 distinct mutation categories .",
    "a , c @xmath4 g , c @xmath4 g , t @xmath4 a , t @xmath4 c , t @xmath4 g , whereas the other six base mutations are equivalent to these by base complementarity .",
    "each of these 6 possible base mutations is flanked by 4 possible bases on each side thereby producing @xmath5 distinct mutation categories . ]",
    "the data is organized into a matrix @xmath6 , where the rows correspond to the @xmath7 mutation categories , the columns correspond to @xmath8 samples , and each element is a nonnegative occurrence count of a given mutation in a given sample . the commonly accepted method for extracting cancer signatures from @xmath6",
    "@xcite is via nonnegative matrix factorization ( nmf ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "under nmf the matrix @xmath9 is approximated via @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is an @xmath12 matrix , @xmath13 is a @xmath14 matrix , and both @xmath15 and @xmath16 are nonnegative .",
    "the appeal of nmf is its biologic interpretation whereby the @xmath17 columns of the matrix @xmath15 are interpreted as the weights with which the @xmath17 cancer signatures contribute into the @xmath7 mutation categories , and the columns of the matrix @xmath16 are interpreted as the exposures to the @xmath17 signatures in each sample .",
    "the price to pay for this is that nmf , which is an iterative procedure , is computationally costly and depending on the number of samples @xmath8 it can take days or even weeks to run it .",
    "furthermore , it does not automatically fix the number of signatures @xmath17 , which must either be guessed or obtained via trial and error , thereby adding to the computational cost .",
    "additional considerations include : i ) out - of - sample instability , i.e. , the signatures obtained from non - overlapping sets of samples can be dramatically different ; ii ) in - sample instability , i.e. , the signatures can have a strong dependence on the initial iteration choice ; and iii ) samples with low counts or sparsely populated samples ( i.e. , those with many zeros ",
    "such samples are ubiquitous , e.g. , in exome data ) are usually deemed not too useful as they contribute to the in - sample instability .",
    "happily , a conceptually similar problem is well - studied in quantitative finance and we can simply borrow from the arsenal of tools developed there once we establish a _ dictionary _ between the biologic and finance quantities .",
    "thus , in the quant finance context one deals with a portfolio of @xmath18 stocks , which are analogous to the @xmath19 mutation categories .",
    "the data consists of a time series of @xmath8 ( e.g. , daily ) stock returns for each stock , so we have an @xmath20 matrix @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath8 observations in the time series of stock returns are analogous to the @xmath8 samples in the cancer data .",
    "the returns @xmath21 are analogous to the counts @xmath6 except that the returns @xmath21 need not be positive . however , this does not affect what we wish to borrow from quantitative finance .    the sample _ correlation _ , where @xmath22 are the sample variances and @xmath23 . ]",
    "matrix @xmath24 computed based on the time series of stock returns contains important information about the correlation structure of the returns .",
    "its spectral decomposition via principal components provides a tool for identifying common _",
    "risk factors _ underlying the returns , i.e. , up to an error term , we have @xmath25 , where the columns of the @xmath12 ( so - called factor loadings ) matrix @xmath26 are related to the first @xmath17 principal components of @xmath24 , and the columns of the @xmath14 matrix @xmath27 are the time series of the factor returns . in our dictionary ,",
    "the matrix @xmath28 is analogous to the matrix @xmath15 , and the matrix @xmath29 is analogous to the matrix @xmath16 .",
    "so , why is this useful , especially considering that the matrices @xmath28 and @xmath29 are not nonnegative in the finance context ?",
    "there are two pieces of useful information we can extract from this analogy .",
    "first , algorithms for fixing the number of factors @xmath17 are readily available @xcite .",
    "so , if we compute the sample correlation matrix @xmath24 based on our occurrence count matrix @xmath6 and apply the methods employed in _ statistical risk models _ , we can fix the number of cancer signatures ( or at least a useful expected range for it ) based on purely statistical methods . which optimizes the contributions from the factors ( signatures ) and the error terms into the diagonal of @xmath24 .",
    "] e.g. , one such method proposed in @xcite is based on erank ( effective rank ) @xcite of @xmath24 and appears to work well for cancer signatures .",
    "second , intuitively it is clear that there is a lot of noise in the occurrence count data @xmath6 .",
    "there are mutations that also occur in healthy humans , e.g. , via imperfections in dna repair .",
    "furthermore , one can expect that in the presence of cancer such or similar mutations not directly associated with cancer signatures may become more ubiquitous due to disruption in the normal operation of various processes ( including repair ) in dna .",
    "this  background noise \" obscures the signatures and must be identified and factored out of the data prior to attempting any signature extraction . in the context of finance",
    "this is well - known as the  market \" mode , which corresponds to the overall movement of the broad market affecting all stocks ( to varying degrees )  cash inflow ( outflow ) into ( from ) the market tends to push stock prices higher ( lower ) .",
    "this is the market risk factor . to mitigate this risk factor , one can , e.g. , hold a dollar - neutral portfolio of stocks ( the same dollar holdings for long and short positions )",
    ": @xmath30 .",
    "] and we can use this analogy for cancer signatures .    based on our empirical analysis , we indeed find what we term the  overall \" mode  the analog of the  market \" mode in finance  in the occurrence count data .",
    "it is unequivocally present .",
    "here is a simple way to understand this  overall \" mode .",
    "the average pair - wise correlation @xmath24 between different mutations ( @xmath31 ) is nonzero and is in fact high for most cancer types we study .",
    "this is noise that must be factored out .",
    "if we aggregate samples by cancer type and compute the sample correlation matrix @xmath24 for the so - aggregated data ( across the @xmath32 cancer types we study ) , the average correlation is about 75% if we base it on @xmath6 , and over whopping 96% if we use the log - based matrix instead ( see below ) .",
    "another way of thinking about this is that the occurrence counts in different samples are not normalized uniformly across all samples .",
    "therefore , running nmf on a vanilla matrix @xmath6 could amount to mixing apples with oranges thereby obscuring the true underlying signatures .",
    "factoring out the  overall \" mode ( or  de - noising \" the matrix @xmath6 ) therefore most simply would amount to cross - sectional ( i.e. , across the 96 mutation categories ) demeaning .",
    "simply put , we could demean the columns of @xmath6 .",
    "one evident issue with this is that , while the so - demeaned @xmath6 can be used in the context of applying statistical factor model methods to it ( recall that the returns @xmath21 need not be positive ) to fix the number of signatures , we would not be able to run nmf on such a matrix as it is no longer nonnegative .",
    "another , more subtle issue is that distributions of counts in @xmath6  the counts being nonnegative numbers  are not ( quasi ) normal but skewed , with long tails at the higher end .",
    "in fact , they are quasi log - normal , which is common for nonnegative quantities . therefore , instead of demeaning the columns of @xmath9",
    ", it makes much more sense to demean the columns of @xmath33 ( and re - exponentiate for the purpose of running nmf ) .",
    "a minor hiccup is that some elements of @xmath6 can be 0 .",
    "a simple way to deal with this is to set @xmath34 and construct the correlation matrix @xmath24 based on @xmath21 ( as opposed to @xmath6 ) or @xmath35 , which is @xmath21 with columns demeaned  this amounts to factoring out the  overall \" mode .",
    "we run our analysis using @xmath21 , @xmath35 as well as @xmath6 and @xmath36 ( which is @xmath6 with columns demeaned ) and unequivocally find that using  de - noised \" log - based matrix @xmath35 works best .",
    "summarizes the mean / median ratio and skewness for the matrices @xmath6 and @xmath21 across cancer types and mutation categories and makes the skewed nature of the counts evident .",
    "this skewness is exacerbated when we consider it across samples for many individual cancer types .",
    "also , figures [ noise.1 ] and [ noise.2 ] help visualize why factoring out the  overall \" mode reduces noise . ]",
    "so , here is a simple prescription for fixing the number of signatures using our statistical factor model based methodology .",
    "compute @xmath35 as above for the occurrence counts aggregated by cancer type .",
    "i.e. , @xmath6 is an @xmath37 matrix , where the number of cancer types @xmath38 in our case .",
    "compute the sample correlation matrix @xmath24 based on @xmath35 , i.e. , the correlations are computed across the 14 cancer types .",
    "compute @xmath39 and round it to the nearest integer .",
    "this is the expected number of cancer signatures @xmath17 ( excluding the  overall \" mode , which is noise ) .",
    "this simple procedure appears to work well for this purpose and we explain in detail why this is the case based on the statistical factor model methodology , along with another method for fixing @xmath17 , which gives similar results",
    ". a complementary way of fixing @xmath17 is to compute the sample correlation matrices @xmath40_{ij}$ ] for each cancer type labeled by @xmath41 ( @xmath40_{ij}$ ] is computed based on the samples for the @xmath42-th cancer type ) , take the first principal component @xmath43^{(1)}_i$ ] for each correlation matrix @xmath40_{ij}$ ] , compute the @xmath44 matrix of inner products @xmath45^{(1)}_i~[v(\\beta)]^{(1)}_i$ ] , compute @xmath46 , and identify @xmath17 with rounded @xmath47 .",
    "this method produces essentially the same prediction for @xmath17 as the aforesaid method using @xmath39 .",
    "once we fix the expected number of signatures @xmath17 , we are ready to use nmf to extract cancer signatures . however , as mentioned above , running nmf on @xmath6 is suboptimal as it contains noise due to the  overall \" mode . a simple way to eliminate",
    "the  overall \" mode is to run nmf on the re - exponentiated matrix @xmath48 .",
    "note that the elements in @xmath49 are no longer interpreted as  counts \"  they are fractional and low .",
    "we can include an overall normalization , or @xmath50 , etc.[foot.norm ] ] to make it look more like the original matrix @xmath6 , however , this does not affect the signatures extracted via nmf .. this can be done using the definitions in footnote [ foot.norm ] and the ( relatively scarce ) negative elements resulting from subtracting 1 should be zeroed out .",
    "however , this does not seem to affect the results much , so not to overcomplicate things we work with @xmath48 .",
    "] now we are in good shape : we have the expected number of signatures @xmath17 and the  de - noised \" matrix @xmath49 from which we can extract signatures via nmf .",
    "remarkably , what we find is 4 previously known signatures plus 3 new signatures .",
    "one of the new signatures dominates liver cancer ( with over 96% contribution ) , with almost no peak variability .",
    "another new signature to a lesser degree dominates renal cell carcinoma ( with over 70% contribution ) .",
    "the third new signature appears mostly in bone cancer , brain lower grade glioma and medulloblastoma ( and also 5 other cancers to lesser degrees ) .",
    "we find the same signatures ( plus the  overall \" mode ) if we use @xmath6 instead of @xmath49 , but the signatures are unequivocally more stable when using @xmath49 .",
    "simply put , removing the  overall \" mode ( the noise ) pays off high dividends .",
    "now , we emphasize that our results are based on using the occurrence counts aggregated by cancer type .",
    "the advantages of this method include : i ) the data is much less noisy than for samples by individual cancer type ; and ii ) it allows us to use _ all _ genomic data , including that with low counts . in this",
    "regard , our approach here can be readily applied to exome data , which we will report elsewhere along with extending our analysis to individual cancer types .",

    "@xmath69 is the sample correlation matrix , and @xmath70 .",
    "note that @xmath23 .    when @xmath71 , @xmath72 is singular : we have @xmath73 , so only @xmath61 columns of the matrix @xmath74 are linearly independent .",

    "pursuant to the bai - yin theorem @xcite , the smallest and largest eigenvalues of scm have the limits @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is fixed and @xmath87 .",
    "so for @xmath88 we must have @xmath89 for all eigenvalues to be close to 1.[fn.by ] ] on the other hand , sample variances tend to be much more stable out - of - sample and in many cases can be reliably computed even if @xmath90 .",
    "one way to think about this is to note that @xmath91 , so if the serially demeaned quantities @xmath74 are ( quasi-)normally distributed within each series and @xmath63 , then @xmath92 should be relatively stable .      in many applications involving scm",
    ", it must be invertible and , furthermore , out - of - sample stable .",
    "as mentioned above , in many cases scm does not satisfy these requirements and one replaces it with a _ constructed _ matrix such that it is positive definite and more stable .",
    "however , in practice it is convenient to model the sample correlation matrix @xmath24 instead of @xmath72 , for two reasons .",
    "first , since sample variances @xmath92 are relatively stable and can be readily computed , there is no need to model them ; it is the pair - wise correlations @xmath24 ( @xmath68 ) that require modeling .",
    "second , in many cases , the sample variances @xmath92 have a skewed cross - sectional \" . ]",
    "( e.g. , ( quasi ) log - normal ) distribution , as is often the case with positive - valued quantities .",
    "it is therefore convenient to factor @xmath93 out of scm , i.e. , to work with the sample correlation matrix @xmath94 .",
    "its diagonal elements are nicely uniform ( @xmath95 ) , and the off - diagonal elements @xmath24 ( @xmath68 ) take values in @xmath96 with a tight distribution .",
    "we can think of @xmath24 as a sample covariance matrix for _ normalized _ quantities @xmath97 , i.e. , @xmath98 .",
    "so , in what follows we will always work with @xmath24 and @xmath99 , and scm will refer to the sample correlation matrix @xmath24 .",
    "factor models are a popular method for constructing a nonsingular replacement @xmath100 for @xmath24 : @xmath101 here : @xmath102 is the specific ( a.k.a .",

    "i.e. , the off - diagonal elements of scm ( i.e. , the pair - wise correlations @xmath24 , @xmath68 ) are modeled via contributions from @xmath17 factors @xmath107 , while the diagonal elements of scm ( i.e. , @xmath23 ) receive contributions from the factors and purely diagonal specific variances @xmath102 .",
    "this corresponds to modeling @xmath99 via a matrix @xmath108 such that : @xmath109 as above , @xmath110 are serial covariances . in serial covariances @xmath111 .",
    "] a nice feature of @xmath100 is that it is positive - definite ( and thus invertible ) if fcm is positive - definite assuming that all @xmath112",
    ".    we can think about ( [ upsilon ] ) as an _ approximation _ for the decomposition @xmath113 whereby @xmath99 , an @xmath20 matrix , is assumed to essentially be described by a linear @xmath17-factor model , @xmath107 being the factors .",
    "then @xmath114 corresponds to the  error \" term , i.e. , deviation from a linear factor model .",
    "note that generally @xmath115 .",
    "thus , generally the matrix @xmath116 is not diagonal , nor do the covariances @xmath117 vanish .",
    "however , approximating @xmath99 via @xmath108 is useful because constructing the factor model ( [ fac.mod ] ) for scm involves defining @xmath26 , which we then can use to further compute the factors @xmath107 , e.g. , via the least - squares method , i.e. , by minimizing the ",
    "quadratic error \" @xmath118 . this , by definition ,",
    "is equivalent to a cross - sectional linear regression of @xmath99 over @xmath26 ( without the intercept ) , where @xmath119 are the regression coefficients , whereas @xmath114 are the regression residuals .",

    "<S> we present a novel method for extracting cancer signatures by applying statistical risk models ( http://ssrn.com/abstract=2732453 ) from quantitative finance to cancer genome data . using 1389 whole genome sequenced samples from 14 cancers , we identify an  overall \" mode of somatic mutational noise . </S>",
    "<S> we give a prescription for factoring out this noise and source code for fixing the number of signatures . </S>",
    "<S> we apply nonnegative matrix factorization ( nmf ) to genome data aggregated by cancer subtype and filtered using our method . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant signatures have substantially lower variability than those from unfiltered data . </S>",
    "<S> also , the computational cost of signature extraction is cut by about a factor of 10 . </S>",
    "<S> we find 3 novel cancer signatures , including a liver cancer dominant signature ( 96% contribution ) and a renal cell carcinoma signature ( 70% contribution ) . </S>",
