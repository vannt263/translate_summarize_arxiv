    "star formation is a complex dynamical process where the attractive force of gravity must overcome the dispersive effects of pressure and angular momentum .",
    "once stars form , they provide feedback into the nascent molecular clouds by generating powerful bipolar outflows that evacuate cavities and deposit momentum into the clouds ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . in regions of star formation where the most massive star has a spectral type earlier than @xmath1 b3 ( m @xmath2 10 m@xmath3 ) , radiation is the primary feedback mechanism . in these cases , intense ultraviolet radiation from the massive stars ionizes an ` h ii region ' within which h is nearly fully - ionized . at the boundaries of an h ii region , h quickly transitions to a high - density neutral state",
    "called a photodissociation region or pdr .",
    "radiation that is less - energetic than the ionization potential of h ( 13.6 ev ) penetrates into the pdr , and affects molecular chemistry by dissociating molecules , heating dust grains , and ionizing elements such as c @xcite .    irradiated pdr interfaces are important to understand because it is here where radiation deposits energy into and ultimately disrupts the molecular cloud .",
    "the disruption occurs as neutral material at the front becomes ionized and , finding itself at a high temperature , ablates into the less - dense h ii region .",
    "the ablation flow drives pressure waves and weak shock fronts back into the molecular cloud , heating the gas and dust near the interface and thereby enhancing the formation rate of complex molecules in the pdr",
    ". the ablation process may also affect star formation because gas located at the tips of pillars compresses in response to the radiation pressure .",
    "some studies suggest this inward pressure may trigger stars to form at these locations , though it can be difficult to distinguish sequential star formation , where there are simply spatial gradients in the apparent ages , from triggering @xcite .",
    "the morphologies of the interfaces provide unique opportunities to study how fluid dynamical instabilities form and develop in astrophysical systems .",
    "hence , along with gravity and rotation , radiation hydrodynamics is one of the dominant physical processes in regions of massive star formation , and one that is amenable to study in the laboratory .",
    "the intense radiation environments present in laser experiments often produce ablation flows at locations where the radiation interacts with a surface @xcite . as material ablates ,",
    "the interfaces can become irregular in shape and eventually transform into pillar - like structures @xcite whose morphologies resemble those present in molecular clouds subject to radiation from nearby massive stars @xcite .",
    "h ii regions and molecular clouds are distinct phases of the interstellar medium , and the clouds often show sharp boundaries that are easily - observed at optical wavelengths because dust within molecular clouds absorbs optical light from background sources such as stars or emission from the hot gas in the h ii region .",
    "while these boundaries often exhibit beautiful and complex morphologies , connecting the observed morphologies with radiation - driven instabilities is not always a straightforward task .",
    "depending on the situation , other physical processes such as bulk motions of molecular clouds relative to the gas within an h ii region , internal magnetic and thermal pressure gradients , and the presence of dense clumps within clouds may be more important than radiation in determining how an interface appears and how it evolves with time .    to identify an interface as a promising analog for radiative - driven instabilites we need to separate regions where the ultraviolet flux is highest from others where the radiative flux is lower . from an observational standpoint",
    ", it is challenging to determine exactly where the ultraviolet radiation deposits its energy , because regions of star formation are so dusty that lines of sight to pdr interfaces are typically opaque at both optical and ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "hence , some of the apparent boundaries may simply result from a dense dusty cloud in the foreground that obscures a bright background h  ii region .",
    "fortunately , because fluorescent ultraviolet excitation of h@xmath0 is always accompanied by specific infrared emission lines that radiate as the molecule decays to its ground state , one can image true pdr interfaces directly in these infrared lines where obscuration by dust is negligible .    as a broad cut",
    ", one can sort massive star - forming regions by the number of o stars , which , along with the rare luminous blue variable ( lbv ) and wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , represent the classes of the most massive stars .",
    "the o - spectral class is subdivided by increasing mass and photospheric temperature into o9 , o8 , o7 , and so on , up to about o3 and o2 , which are the most massive o stars known .",
    "less - massive stars are always more common , so , for example , a region that contains an o3 star will typically have many o5 @xmath4 o9 stars .",
    "the most massive stars should become supernovae within a few million years of their birth , and undoubtedly influence the ongoing star formation in their vicinity , which would otherwise last for tens of millions of years . while they are present",
    ", the uv radiation from the most massive stars will dominate the ionization of its surroundings because the most massive stars have the hottest photospheres and therefore the highest photon luminosities @xmath5 13.6 ev .",
    "the uv luminosity ( photons / second ) depends strongly upon the photospheric temperature because the uv part of stellar spectra lies on the wien portion of the blackbody curve .",
    "for example , a typical o3 star emits an order of magnitude more photons capable of ionizing h than does an o7.5 star , and nearly two orders of magnitude more than an o9.5 star @xcite .",
    "this paper presents near - ir images of the pdr interfaces of four regions of massive star formation that span a range of ultraviolet radiation fields and morphologies , from large wall - like structures in a region with only a few o stars ( ara ob1 ) , to spectacular pillars within more massive regions ( carina and eagle ) , to isolated globules in an extremely massive and somewhat older complex ( cygnus ob2 ) .",
    "the goal is to provide the laboratory astrophysics community with several examples of typical ablation interfaces that are present within regions of massive star formation , as these may prove to be useful analogs for ongoing or planned experimental work .",
    "the next section describes the physics of h@xmath0 fluorescence along with the observational program , and the paper continues with a description of what the new images show in each of the four regions .",
    "figure  1 summarizes the physics of fluorescent excitation of h@xmath0 .",
    "ultraviolet photons with energies less than the ionization potential of h ( 13.6 ev ) penetrate into the region of neutral gas where molecular hydrogen exists . if their energy is greater than about 10 ev , these photons can excite h@xmath0 from its ground electronic state to the lyman and werner bands .",
    "these bands can be visualized as resulting from the overlap of the n=2 levels of the indivdual h atoms atoms when the protons are separated by the intranuclear distance of @xmath1 1@xcite .",
    "as excited h@xmath0 molecules cascade back to their ground states , there is a probability that they will pass through the j = 3 ( rotational ) v = 1 ( vibrational ) level .",
    "because h@xmath0 is a symmetric molecule , it has no dipole moment , and transitions of @xmath6j = @xmath71 do not occur .",
    "however , the molecule can decay via @xmath6j = @xmath42 quadrupole radiation to the j = 1 v = 0 level by emitting an infrared photon at 2.12@xmath8 m .",
    "designated as the 1 - 0s(1 ) transition ( s indicating @xmath6j = @xmath42 and ` 1 ' referring to the j - value of the lower state ) , this emission line traces the interface where the ultraviolet radiation encounters molecular hydrogen .    .",
    "ultraviolet light from the massive star excites h@xmath0 to the lyman and werner bands .",
    "the 2.12@xmath8 m emission line radiates as h@xmath0 molecules cascade down to their lower states .",
    "infrared lines like 2.12@xmath8 m penetrate through intervening dust , which absorbs ultraviolet and optical light , and as such are ideal tracers of the interface between the ionized and molecular gas when the ultraviolet radiation field is strong . ]",
    "our h@xmath0 observations were taken with the noao newfirm camera on two observing runs , 20 - 22 sept 2008 at the 4-m telescope at kitt - peak national observatory in arizona , and at the 4-m telescope at the cerro - tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) in chile 16 - 18 march 2011 .",
    "a single newfirm image has a large field of view of @xmath1 28 arcminutes , and a fine plate scale of 0.4 arcseconds per pixel .",
    "the seeing ranged between 0.7 and 1.8 arcseconds over the course of the observations with the exception of the h@xmath0 and k - band images of m  16 ( see section 3.3 ) .",
    "the final images have a spatial resolution @xmath1 4 times better than that possible with the spitzer space telescope .",
    "in addition , unlike spitzer observations of h@xmath0 that rely upon broadband filters that transmit many emission lines as well as a large amount of continuum , the newfirm h@xmath0 observations were taken through a narrowband filter ( @xmath9/@xmath10 @xmath1 1% ) centered on the 1 - 0s(1 ) 2.12@xmath8 m transition . as part of the program we sometimes also obtained a narrowband 2.16 @xmath8 m br@xmath11 image to detect recombination from h in the h ii region and to aid in continuum subtraction , and a broadband 2.2@xmath8 m k - image to identify continuum from warm dust",
    ". a typical observing sequence involved a grid of up to 72 images dithered spatially in a set pattern . data reduction followed a procedure more fully - described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "infrared observations of the southern targets ( ara , eagle and carina ) were complemented by broadband optical b , v , r , and i and narrowband h@xmath12 images taken with the y4kcam at the ctio 1-m yalo telescope 12 - 17 march 2011 .",
    "the y4kcam is a 4064@xmath134064 backside - illuminated ccd with a plate scale of 0.289 arcseconds per pixel and a field of view of 20 arcminutes .",
    "data reduction followed standard bias - subtraction and flatfielding procedures , with the additional requirement that twilight sky flats were needed to remove a residual large - scale illumination pattern .",
    "several position dithers were used for each image to reduce internal reflections from bright stars in the final median composite .",
    "we used a distortion map determined from stellar positions to align the y4kcam images with the newfirm data to within @xmath1 0.1 arcseconds .",
    "all data reductions were performed within the iraf environment .",
    "the narrowband h@xmath0 filter blocks most of the continuum present in the k - band , but all filters admit some continuum",
    ". it can be important to remove this component when comparing the spatial positions of different emission lines along an interface , and in regions where there are many background stars .",
    "however , the continuum does not affect appearance of the pdr boundaries in the images significantly because the h@xmath0 bandpass is narrow enough that infrared continuum contributions are small in the target objects .",
    "subtracting a scaled k - band image to remove continuum can be problematic owing to slightly differing seeing conditions and sub - pixel alignment differences .",
    "for these reasons the narrowband images are uncorrected for continuum , though we make use of the k - band to help interpret the regions , and in some cases subtract the continuum with a scaled br@xmath11 or k - band image to create an image that removes most stars and highlights the pdr interfaces .",
    "ara ob1 is a region of star formation in the southern sky centered @xmath1 1.5 degrees out of the galactic plane and subtending about a degree on the sky ( @xmath1 20 pc at its distance of 1320 pc , @xcite ) .",
    "its stellar population consists of a young open cluster , ngc 6193 , whose most massive members are an o7 star and an o5/o6 binary @xcite , similar to the situation in the orion nebula .",
    "ultraviolet radiation from these stars illuminates the rim nebula ngc 6188 , a delicate undulating feature located about 15 arcminutes ( 6 pc ) to the west of the cluster .",
    "the rim nebula outlines the edge of a dark cloud , within which lies an embedded star formation region known as rcw 108 .",
    "a co survey of the region uncovered many distinct clouds along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "new h@xmath12 , br@xmath11 , and h@xmath0 images of the region are shown in fig .  2 . the h@xmath12 image highlights material as it boils off the pdr and recombines as it becomes ionized . although the h@xmath12 image outlines the interface between the ionized and neutral gas well , the boundary is not sharp and is strongly affected by dust extinction .",
    "the multicolor composite in the middle panel shows a thin red ( h@xmath0 ) feature which marks the actual boundary of the pdr where the uv light is absorbed .",
    "this boundary is also clear in the difference image ( br@xmath11 - h@xmath0 ) in the right panel .",
    "the advantage of the difference image is that br@xmath11 and h@xmath0 1 - 0s(1 ) have nearly the same wavelength , so the relative amount of stellar continuum for each star is nearly the same for all sources , and as a result the stars tend to subtract out .",
    "the h@xmath0 feature circled in the right panel has a more clumpy morphology and appears to originate from the rcw 108 region .",
    "this feature may be a stellar jet that becomes visible as shock waves heat the ambient h@xmath0 .",
    "if it is a jet , the h@xmath0 knots should exhibit detectable proper motions on the sky after a suitable time interval .",
    "overall , the rim nebula is a wonderful example of an interface that appears more or less linear on the sky , and exhibits the beginnings of pillar formation .",
    "two features at the top of the h@xmath0 image and one at the bottom are @xmath1 0.5 pc in size , with many smaller features present along the rim , though there is a lack of detached irradiated globules .",
    "the ultraviolet radiation field in ara ob1 is not particularly strong because the hottest star is only an o5 , and this results in a detectable , albeit moderate signal of h@xmath0 from the pdr interface . as in all such regions , without a dedicated numerical study one can not readily determine if the undulating structure present along the rim nebula results from variations in the gas density along the rim , from instabilities induced by radiation , or some combination of the two .",

    "its most famous resident is undoubtedly @xmath14 car , a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) that was once one of the brightest stars in the sky before it ejected a massive shell about 170 years ago@xcite , and is a prime candidate for the next supernova in our galaxy .",
    "several clusters of massive stars , including tr  14 , tr  15 , tr  16 , bo  10 , bo  11 , coll  228 , and coll  232 exist in the vicinity .",

    "our observations of the eagle appear in fig .",
    "the h@xmath15 images were taken in poor seeing conditions ( 2.8 arcseconds , as compared to 0.8 arcseconds for br@xmath11 ) which has the effect of blurring out sharp features .",
    "nonetheless one can identify that the main interaction regions are the pillars , the spire , and the ridge , with the most extensive h@xmath0 located in the ridge .",
    "spatial offsets between the br@xmath11 and h@xmath0 are in the same sense that we observed in ara and carina , with the br@xmath11 emission located closer to the ionizing sources in the cluster .",

    "note @xcite , much of the star formation activity may be finished in the eagle , leaving only a few areas like the ridge and the pillars for irradiated interfaces .",
    "apart from the possible jet at the bottom of the north bay , our h@xmath0 images do not reveal any striking new features , though in addition to the well - known pillars and spire , we can identify the ridge as a promising area where extensive , and relatively bright pdr interfaces exist .",
    "images of the ridge taken during better seeing conditions would likely resolve the h@xmath0 emission into a filamentary , bumpy wall like we observed in ara ob1 .",
    "if one were to fly far above the galactic plane and look down upon the structure of the milky way within a few kpc of the sun , a single star formation region would stand out as being the major area of activity in this portion of the galaxy : cyg ob2 .",
    "also known as cygnus x , the region houses over 120 o stars , including several of type o3 @xcite , has a candidate for the most massive star in the galaxy , evidence for recent supernovae @xcite , and may even be the source of a large - scale galactic fountain @xcite .",

    "a dense cluster of massive stars anchored by the o3 star s 22 at the core of the region ( panel d ) is the main source of radiation , although o stars are scattered throughout the area . surrounding the core we find dozens of irradiated globules that possess head - tail structures with the tails pointing away from the ionizing sources .",
    "several of these are shown in fig .  5 , along with an arrow that denotes the distance to s 22 .",
    "some of these objects have been discovered independently by other authors and described in recent papers @xcite .",
    "each panel demonstrates an important aspect of radiation hydrodynamics in the star formation process .",
    "panel a shows that two stars within this globule are surrounded by reflection nebulae , indicating that stars still form here .",
    "narrow filaments of h@xmath0 are associated with the stars in the globule as they create their own cavity from an outflowing wind , but the overall shape of the pdr is still driven by the cluster of o stars at the large projected distance of over 20 pc . hence , young massive stars like those in cyg ob2 can influence the ongoing star formation over a very large volume .",
    "this motif repeats in panel c , where a young star at the apex of the globule appears to have created enough of a cavity to nearly detach from its globule .",
    "panel b depicts what appears to be an earlier stage reminiscent of the wall in ara ob1 , where small pillars are beginning to form .",
    "panels e and f display small remnants of globules that appear similar to objects known as proplyds in the orion nebula .",
    "the proplyd within panel e possesses a wonderful ` wiggling ' tail that resembles a kelvin - helmholtz instability ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is unclear what role stellar winds from the core play in creating this shape , as the wind should first encounter a strong bow shock around the obstacle before the postshock wind could interact with the neutral material to create a shear layer that would induce mass stripping . the h@xmath0 images here show only the boundary where the molecular gas becomes excited by direct uv radiation from the core stars and by ambient uv radiation scattered within the h ii region or originating from less massive o stars in the vicinity .",
    "it is likely that a bow shock is present ahead of the proplyd , but this shock would be difficult to detect if the wind from the massive stars is fully ionized .",
    "the wave - like structure along the sides of the proplyd in panel e has a characteristic length on the order of the size of the dense clump at the head of the globule .",

    "the many o stars scattered throughout the region and the lack of bright irradiated walls near the cluster suggests may be several million years older than our other targets @xcite , though some star formation continues within the few remaining globules .",
    "these globules , probably the densest leftovers from the original molecular cloud , glow along their boundaries in h@xmath0 as they respond to the intense uv ambient radiation field and possibly strong stellar winds from o stars in the area . in some cases radiation from one or more young stars at the head of the globule also affects the dynamics of the system . in cyg",
    "ob2 we are witnessing the last stages of the photoablation processes in a region where the most massive stars have already formed and have cleared away most of the ambient material .",
    "regions of massive star formation offer some of the best and most easily - observed examples of radiation hydrodynamics .",
    "the boundary where the fully ionized h  ii region transitions to the neutral / molecular photodissociation region is of particular interest because the marked temperature and density contrasts across the boundary lead to evaporative flows and fluid dynamical instabilities that can develop into spectacular pillar - like structures .",
    "pillars subsequently become ionized globules when they detach from their parent clouds , and the globules often harbor one or more young stars at their apices .",
    "it is possible to observe the interface between the h  ii region and pdr directly by imaging in the light of the h@xmath0 1 - 0s(1 ) transition , which occurs as a byproduct of fluorescent excitation of h@xmath0 to the lyman and werner bands .",
    "extinction by dust is negligible at 2.12@xmath8 m , so it is possible to observe this interface directly , and with better spatial resolution than was possible from wide - field space - based missions such as spitzer and herschel .",
    "the new images illustrate how radiation can sculpt molecular clouds into a variety of spectacular forms . notwithstanding the dizzying array of morphologies",
    ", there appears to be a progression from ( i ) the wavy wall - like structure in ara ob1 , where radiation appears to have had as yet only a modest influence on the molecular cloud , to ( ii ) the intricate pillars and cavity walls within carina and to a lesser extent in the eagle nebula , where radiation and outflows are in the process of tearing the cloud apart , to ( iii ) the relatively isolated head - tail globules in cygnus ob2 , where the massive stars have already dissipated much of the natal molecular cloud , and leave behind only small remnants .",
    "future efforts by our group will focus on quantifying how spatial offsets between different emission lines in the pdr change as the ultraviolet radiation source varies in strength .",
    "finding evidence for or against stellar wind shocks is another important observational goal , as the massive stars which generate the uv radiation field can also drive powerful winds that disrupt their surroundings .",
    "numerically , there is a clear challenge to predict offsets between different emission lines in a pdr , and to distinguish irregular interfaces where the shape is driven by radiative instabilities from those produced by dense clumps within the molecular cloud .",
    "combining radiation with winds should be another numerical frontier .",
    "on the experimental side , new programs at omega and nif should begin to explore the regime of radiative shocks and strongly - irradiated interfaces @xcite , and can look for similar structures to the ones presented here .",
    "this work was made possible through doe funding via the nluf program .",
    "we thank r. probst for his assistance with the kpno observations , the staff of ctio for their support at the 4-m and 1-m telescopes and w. henney for useful discussions about pdrs ."

    "<S> regions of massive star formation offer some of the best and most easily - observed examples of radiation hydrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> boundaries where fully - ionized h ii regions transition to neutral / molecular photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) are of particular interest because marked temperature and density contrasts across the boundaries lead to evaporative flows and fluid dynamical instabilities that can evolve into spectacular pillar - like structures . </S>",
    "<S> when detached from their parent clouds , pillars become ionized globules that often harbor one or more young stars . </S>",
    "<S> h@xmath0 molecules at the interface between a pdr and an h  ii region absorb ultraviolet light from massive stars , and the resulting fluoresced infrared emission lines are an ideal way to trace this boundary independent of obscuring dust . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents h@xmath0 images of four regions of massive star formation that illustrate different types of pdr boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> the ara ob1 star formation region contains a striking long wall that has several wavy structures which are present in h@xmath0 , but the emission is not particularly bright because the ambient uv fluxes are relatively low . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the carina star formation region shows strong h@xmath0 fluorescence both along curved walls and at the edges of spectacular pillars that in some cases have become detached from their parent clouds . </S>",
    "<S> the less - spectacular but more well - known eagle nebula has two regions that have strong fluorescence in addition to its pillars . while somewhat older than the other regions , cyg ob2 has the highest number of massive stars of the regions surveyed and contains many isolated , fluoresced globules that have head - tail morphologies which point towards the sources of ionizing radiation . </S>",
    "<S> these images provide a collection of potential astrophysical analogs that may relate to ablated interfaces observed in laser experiments of radiation hydrodynamics .    </S>",
