    "in the framework of the hierarchical formation models of galaxies , mergers play an important role in building massive galaxies , transporting gas toward the galactic centres , initiating bursts of nuclear star formation , and/or triggering the activity of the central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "a blind search for dual flat - spectrum cores in the data archives of the very long baseline array ( nrao - vlba ) also failed to identify any other pc - scale - separation nuclear pairs among 3114 sources @xcite .",

    "this in turn gives an upper limit to the jet speed @xmath38@xmath59@xmath60 ( or @xmath590.025  mas  yr@xmath5 apparent proper motion ) , which indicates a moderately relativistic jet .",

    "nevertheless , the apparently symmetry of the jet components with respect to the geometric centre c1 suggests that the jet speed could indeed be small .",
    "the lobe advance speed in young radio sources is much smaller than the jet knot speed @xcite , and the dynamic evolution of young radio sources shows a deceleration of the lobe advance during the cso growth stage @xcite .",
    "direct determination of such a slow proper motion ( 0.025  mas  yr@xmath5 ) requires high - resolution vlbi monitoring observations over a long time interval . on the other hand ,",

[ fig1]b ) , looks like a collimated outflow originating from the western lobe w , after the jet loses its momentum at the ism - igm boundary or at the boundary of the nlr @xcite .",
    "such a feature can be generated when the jet hits the wall in the external medium and flushes out along the pressure gradient or via weak point in the wall @xcite .",

    "this model naturally explains the long extended tongue , avoiding the conflict between the whole source age and the tongue age ( as discussed above ) .",
    "however , the projected radio structure shows a large angle of about 90 between the two jet sides .",
    "physical mechanisms responsible for such a sharp jet bend include jet  cloud interactions and pressure asymmetry in the nlr , but these interpretations require more data ( _ e.g. _ , vlbi polarization data , and/or high - spatial - resolution spectroscopic data ) to be confirmed or rejected .",

    "the flux densities at 74 and 80  mhz are lower than the fit by 58 and 55  per cent , respectively .",
    "this may indicate self - absorption in the source , and a low - frequency turnover between 80 and 160  mhz .",

    "this gives a radio power of @xmath67=1.7@xmath13@xmath68  erg  s@xmath5hz@xmath5 , which places 3c  316 in the high - power mso regime in the power  source size diagram for extragalactic radio source evolution @xcite .",
    "its source size ( @xmath03  kpc ) suggests that 3c  316 is the beginning of the mso phase , where the radio lobes just expanded out of the boundary between the ism and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",

    "this electron density is a typical value for the agn nlr , and may disregard the more complex geometry and any clumpiness of the nlr , owing to the agn - driven outflows , nuclear starbursts , winds driven by jet  cloud - induced bow shocks . in young radio - loud agn , the electron density @xmath106 in the discrete clouds in the nuclear region can be even higher than @xmath108  @xmath107 ( @xmath106@xmath14@xmath13@xmath108  @xmath107 in pks  1345 + 12 , * ? ? ?",

    "the mass estimate of the nlr gas can vary by a factor of 10 .",
    "the h@xmath38 line may be used as an indicator of the rest - frame ( systemic ) velocity of the galaxy .",

    "on the other hand , the radiation pressure of the agn follows from the bolometric luminosity as @xmath113=4.7@xmath13@xmath114@xmath115 , where @xmath115 is the effective optical depth .",
    "thus the injection rate of the kinetic momentum of the nlr gas is only @xmath0@xmath116 per cent of the radiation pressure .",
    "as long as the opacity is not lower than 0.04 , the radiation pressure of the agn is indeed sufficient to drive the ionized outflow .",
    "the two narrow [ oiii ] line components show line widths of 16 per cent and 27 per cent of that of the broad component .",
    "they also show an asymmetric velocity structure relative to the galaxy rest frame with the blue narrow component having a higher relative velocity .",
    "if these [ o iii ] line systems belong to a single agn , the fact that both red- and blue - shifted components are detected may indicate a different origin from that of the broad - wing component .",
    "a straightforward first interpretation suggests that the narrow - peaked velocity components are associated with discrete gas clouds driven by bipolar outflows @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the dual peaks result from rotation in a rotating disc / ring @xcite or a ( partially self - absorbed ) nlr sphere .",
    "the powerful radio jets in 3c316 naturally affect the nlr kinematics at large distances from the nucleus , and may provide mechanical feedback to the host galaxy in the form of high - velocity neutral and ionized outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , the high - velocity ( 491  km s@xmath5 ) [ oiii ] line component in the well - known quasar 3c  48 @xcite , that is spatially associated with the radio jet @xcite , serves as evidence that nlr clouds can be affected by bow shocks of an expanding radio cocoon .",
    "the radio morphology of 3c316 could also show the signature of strong interactions with the nlr clouds , e.g. , the knotty jet structure , the bright discrete jet knots as evidence of shock - brightening and jet - ism interactions , and a curved jet trajectory signifying deflection .",
    "the shocks generated by these jet  cloud interactions provide secondary ionisation .    taking into account the limiting viewing angle of the jets and the observed velocity of the narrow [ oiii ] line components ,",
    "the cocoon outflow velocity would be higher than 800  km  s@xmath5 . besides the radiation - pressure - driven winds accounting for the broad - wing component , the radio jet may thus also provide additional acceleration of the clouds .",
    "a final question relates to the available accretion power that is being channeled into the radio jet .",
    "the kinetic power of an fr i may be derived from a relation between the jet kinetic power @xmath117 ( in the form of x - ray cavity power ) and the radiative power @xmath118 @xcite , and the @xmath117 of an fr ii can be estimated directly from the jet terminal hot spot parameters @xcite .",
    "given a flux density of the 3c316 jet of @xmath119 jy , it gives a jet kinetic power of @xmath117@xmath0@xmath120  erg  s@xmath5 using the @xmath117@xmath121 relation given in eq .",

    "the ratio of the jet power and the accretion power of 3c316 is then @xmath125 , which means that about ( 720 ) per cent of the accretion power would be transferred into the radio jets .",
    "quantitative modeling confirms that such a fraction ( 510 per cent ) of accretion energy of the agn can account for the mechanical feedback to the ism of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "further improvement of these qualitative calculations to support scenario of jet  cloud interactions and to account for the double - peaked line profiles requires more knowledge of the size and mass distribution of the ionized clouds in the nlr .",
    "high - resolution optical images are necessary to identify the location of the red- and blue - shifted narrow velocity components .",
    "polarimetric vlbi images are also required to verify the spatial correlation between the optical narrow - velocity components and the sites of jet - ism interactions .",
    "high - resolution radio interferometric images of the prominent radio galaxy 3c316 have been presented for the first time .",

    "the brightness temperatures of these knots range from 5.1@xmath13@xmath29  k to 42.4@xmath13@xmath29  k , but none of these vlbi components unambiguously identifies the agn core .",
    "2 .   the observed radio structure tends to be consistent with the presence of a single radio - loud agn in 3c  316 , although the possibility of a ( kpc - separation ) radio quiet agn can not entirely be ruled out .",
    "indeed , the number of radio - confirmed binary smbhs or dual agn remains very small , which may suggest that most dual agn are weak radio sources .",

    "the inferred eddington ratio is higher than 0.23 , which indicates that during the early evolutionary stages of the radio source the accretion activity is in a high state .",
    "the broad - wing and narrow - velocity [ oiii ] components show differences in both velocity dispersion and velocity shift , which suggests that they may have different origins .",
    "the broad - wing component may be driven by the radiation pressure of the central ionizing source .",
    "the narrow - velocity components may be ionized locally and accelerated by the bow shocks of the radio jets .    in summary , the present observations of 3c316 did not provide any strong evidence for binary smbhs .",
    "follow - up radio observations are required to identify one ( or more ) core among the many radio knots .",
