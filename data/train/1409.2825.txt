    "the study and characterization of growing interfaces under non - equilibrium conditions is a topic of interdisciplinary interest @xcite . moving interfaces",
    "are often found in physics ( crystal and amorphous material growth , polymers and colloids , granular matter , wetting , thin films ) , physical - chemistry ( catalysis , corrosion , reaction front propagation ) , biology ( cellular , fungal , and bacterial colonies growth , cell - sorting , wound healing , tumor expansion ) , etc . understanding the properties of interfaces in relation to phenomena such as corrosion , adhesion , wetting , friction , micro- or nano - fluidics , etc .",
    "is essential for the development of technological applications .",
    "moreover , the study of interfaces is of fundamental interest as a classical problem in statistical mechanics as they constitute a canonical example of critical phenomena and generic scale - free behavior in systems away from thermal equilibrium .    within this broad context , the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) dynamics @xcite represents the simplest and broadest universality class of non - equilibrium growth @xcite .",
    "its study has been recently boosted by remarkable experimental and theoretical breakthroughs @xcite which have triggered renewed interest .",
    "the kpz interfacial dynamics is defined by the langevin equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the local height of the interfaces , @xmath2 is a driving force , @xmath3 is a zero - mean delta - correlated gaussian noise , the first term on the right - hand side ( with proportionality constant @xmath4 ) describes the relaxation of the interface caused by the surface tension and , finally , @xmath5 is the dominant nonlinear term . this last term accounts for lateral growth and breaks the up - down symmetry in such a way that the interface is not invariant under the transformation @xmath6 .",
    "interfacial roughening properties are customarily analyzed by measuring the _ global _ interface width : @xmath7 ^ 2}\\rangle^{1/2},\\ ] ] where the overbar stands for spatial averages ( in a system of size @xmath8 ) and brackets denote disorder average .",
    "usually , @xmath9 obeys the family - vicsek dynamic scaling ansatz @xcite , namely @xmath10 where the scaling function @xmath11 obeys @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the roughness exponent characterizing the stationary ( or saturated ) regime , @xmath14 is the correlation length in the direction parallel to the interface , @xmath15 the dynamic exponent , and @xmath16 is the growth exponent that governs the short - time behavior of the interface roughening . in particular , for one - dimensional systems in the kpz universality class @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which have been measured in an overwhelming variety of models and also experimentally @xcite .    deviations from the previous values have also been reported in some experimental set - ups , for which it can be argued that the interfacial behavior is crucially affected by the presence of random pinning forces , i.e. by quenched disorder or heterogeneity in the physical background @xcite .",
    "these situations can be addressed by replacing the noise term @xmath3 in eq.([kpz ] ) by a quenched noised @xmath20 , accounting for spatial ( quenched ) heterogeneity @xmath21 with @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is some fast - decaying function and @xmath24 is a external driving force ) , which is known as the quenched kardar - parisi - zhang ( qkpz ) equation .",
    "this equation is usually complemented with the prescription that the interface is not allowed to move backwards ( i.e. @xmath25 ) .",
    "equation ( [ qkpz ] ) exhibits a pinning / depinning phase transition at a certain critical value , @xmath26 , of the external driving force , @xmath24 @xcite : for @xmath27 , interfaces move with a finite velocity while for @xmath28 they ineluctably become pinned by the impurities represented by the quenched noise .    remarkably , the case in which the non - linearity acts in the same direction as the driving force ( @xmath29 ) appears to differ qualitatively from the one in which these two forces oppose each other ( @xmath30 ) : for positive values of @xmath31 ( i.e. the positive qkpz or p - qkpz equation ) the depinning transition is smooth ( second order ) , while for negative @xmath31 ( i.e. the negative qkpz or n - qkpz equation ) it is abrupt ( first order ) .",
    "the underlying reason for such a difference can be easily understood ; taking eq.(5 ) with quenched noise , averaging over noise , integrating in @xmath32 , and imposing the stationary condition , one obtains @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the average local slope .",
    "this equation has a non - trivial solution with @xmath35 if and only if @xmath30 , corresponding to the pinned phase .",
    "this solution corresponds to faceted interfaces of average slope @xmath36 and does not have a counterpart in the positive case , @xmath37 .",
    "observe that the angle of the between facets , @xmath38 , ( see figure 1 ) obeys @xmath39 and reaches a maximum value at the depinning transition .",
    "the faceted solution ceases to exist at @xmath40 where the interface becomes depinned . once the faceted solution breaks down , the interface velocity @xmath41 , experiences a first - order transition and jumps from @xmath42 to some constant stationary value .",
    "even if the transition is discontinuous , the interface shows aspects of scale invariance both above and below the transition point .",
    "this type of hybrid situations sharing aspects of first order transition and scale invariance is known in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "even if this simple argument suggests that the positive and negative cases should exhibit intrinsically different features , a renormalization group calculation reveals no difference between the positive and the negative cases @xcite .",
    "indeed , the renormalized value of @xmath43 diverges , suggesting the existence of a strong coupling fixed point for any value @xmath44 .",
    "the renormalized value of @xmath45 was measured in simulations of the n - qkpz , revealing that it does not diverge but stays finite even as the system approaches its critical point , suggesting that the renormalization group calculation might break down in this case .",
    "but he situation at this theoretical level has not been clarified thus far .    from the computational side ,",
    "the qkpz dynamics has been profusely studied both for positive and negative non - linearities in one spatial dimension .",
    "tang et al .",
    "@xcite proposed that the p - qkpz equation can be effectively described by the statistics of disorder pinning paths and , hence , mapped into the so - called directed percolation depinning ( dpd ) model @xcite .",
    "thus , the roughness exponent is given by the ratio of the two correlation length exponents , in the parallel and perpendicular direction of the directed percolation cluster , namely @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) ; similarly it follows that @xmath48 and hence @xmath49 .",
    "these results agree with numerical simulations of systems in this class @xcite . on the other hand , numerical studies of different models with efective negative",
    "non - linearity confirmed the formation of facets and the existence of a jump at the transition @xcite .",
    "self - organized models in which interfaces self - tune to the transition point @xcite have also been proposed and studied in this context .",
    "sneppen @xcite proposed two different self - organized growth models in random media one leading to facets and the other not and concluded that one lies in the n - qkpz class while the other behaves as p - qkpz . on the contrary , choi et al .",
    "@xcite formulated two other similar self - organized models with positive and negative non - linearities respectively and concluded that the sign of the non - linear term does not affect the universality class .    aimed at clarifying this very confusing state - of - affairs , here we revisit the p - qkpz and the n - qkpz equations . among other methods ,",
    "we analyze the results by employing spectral techniques to establish whether the formation of facets and ultimately the sign of the non - linearity in the qkpz equation plays a relevant role or whether it does not .",
    "in some interfacial problems it is important to distinguish between global and local roughening properties .",
    "local _ interface width @xmath50 is defined as @xmath51 ^ 2}\\rangle^{1/2 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath52 denote disorder average and the overbar an average over @xmath32 in windows of size @xmath53 , obeying @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the growth exponent .",
    "now the scaling function maybe anomalous , i.e. @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a new independent exponent called the local roughness exponent which is in general does not need to coincide with its global counterpart , @xmath13 .",
    "ramasco et al . introduced a general dynamic scaling ansatz for roughening interfaces which includes all the previously - known forms of dynamic scaling as particular cases @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "implicit to this general scaling ansatz is the hypothesis that the interface may exhibit two different types of behavior at short and long scales respectively .",
    "the analysis relies on the structure factor or power spectrum @xmath58 ) @xmath59 where @xmath60 , with @xmath61 .",
    "the generic scaling ansatz for @xmath58 proposed in @xcite is @xmath62 with @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the _ spectral _ roughness exponent . if @xmath65 there is anomalous scaling , while if @xmath66 the standard family - vicsek scaling is recovered .",
    "remarkably , a novel type of anomalous scaling behavior ( with @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) was theoretically predicted in @xcite , and one of the previously mentioned models by sneppen ( the one with facets ) was argued to lie in this family .",
    "let us remark that as emphasized by ramasco and coworkers @xcite @xmath64 does not explicitly appear in the scaling behavior of either @xmath9 , @xmath50 or the height - height correlation function @xmath69 and , thus , can not be deduced from measurements of these quantities , suggesting that a sound study of the roughening properties should include spectral analyses .",
    "we solved numerically eq.([qkpz ] ) with both positive and negative non - linearities in one dimensional lattices and study its spectral properties . for that , we consider a standard finite - differences discretization scheme for eq.([qkpz ] ) in rings of size @xmath8 ( i.e. periodic boundary conditions are assumed ) @xcite .",
    "more refined algorithms as the one proposed in @xcite could be implemented , but they are not necessary for our purposes here .",
    "time is discretized in units of @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and following previous analyses @xcite noise is taken to be uniformly distributed in @xmath72 $ ] with @xmath73 .",
    "initial conditions correspond to a flat interface @xmath74 .",
    "a fresh value of the quenched random force is extracted at position @xmath32 whenever the interface advances at such point ; this value is kept fixed until the interface moves forward again .",
    "ensemble averages are performed over at least @xmath75 different realizations of the quenched randomness .",
    "results have been verified to be robust against changes in these choices .",
    "figure [ profiles]-(a ) shows interface profiles for the p - qkpz case ( with @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) : the interface grows until it becomes eventually pinned for @xmath78 .",
    "the measured roughness exponent at the transition point is @xmath79 in good agreement with the expectation for the dpd class . given that the universality of this class is well understood @xcite , we have not performed further extensive numerical studies of this positive @xmath31 case .      figure [ profiles]-(b ) shows a profile in the n - qkpz case ( @xmath80 ) obtained close to the transition point @xmath81 .",
    "observe the distinct shape of pinned interfaces exhibiting as expected characteristic facets . in agreement with previous findings ,",

    "figure [ profiles]-(b ) shows results for a single realization ; it illustrates the development of a ( single ) well defined pinning center close to @xmath107 at which the interface becomes eventually fully pinned .",
    "a careful inspection of figure [ profiles]-(b ) reveals that the slopes around the peak are not just straight lines but they have some intrinsic roughness .",
    "therefore , two different regimes are expected to emerge when computing the structure function , corresponding to linear slopes and fluctuations on top of them , respectively .",
    "this suggests the existence of anomalous scaling .",

    "observe that , as illustrated in the inset of figure [ fig3 ] , the crossover between short and long scales is rather insensitive to changes in @xmath24 and in @xmath8 , revealing the absence of a diverging correlation length .",
    "the structure function of pinned interfaces ( cf .",

    "we obtain @xmath109 in the small-@xmath98 regime , i.e. for the macroscopic faceted structures .",
    "let us remark , that for the trivial case of a perfectly faceted interface formed by identical segments it is not difficult to show that the spectral roughness exponent is @xmath110 @xcite . on the other hand , we measure , @xmath111 for the large-@xmath98 ( small wavelength ) regime , which corresponds to the roughness that `` modulates '' the slopes of the facets .",

    "our study is focused on the negative case and our main conclusions are :    1 .   measurements of the structure factor of pinned interfaces show anomalous scaling behavior that can be considered as a particular case of the general scaling theory proposed by ramasco et al . as applied to pinned interfaces ( i.e. with no explicit time dependence ) .",
    "@xmath105 exhibits a crossover between the small-@xmath98 regime with @xmath136 ( controlled by facets ) and the large-@xmath98 regime with @xmath137 .",
    "standard measurements of the local and global widths and the analysis of its scaling behavior within the pinned phase ( @xmath106 ) yield @xmath138 .",
    "however , by excluding pinned ( faceted ) interfaces in the calculation of the average we obtained @xmath119 , consistent with the large-@xmath98 scaling of the structure factor .",
    "3 .   finally , direct measurements of the fluctuation around the facets reveal that local fluctuations can be well represented by a roughening exponent @xmath139 .",
    "all these results taken together suggest that local roughening is controlled by the standard kpz roughening exponent .",
    "this result is in agreement with the finding in @xcite for a similar interfacial model with columnar disorder ( i.e. @xmath140 ) ; this model was reported to exhibit facets which roughness profiles on top of them , controlled by a @xmath141 exponent .",
    "furthermore , in this same work @xcite , the authors showed analytically that the dynamics of facets can be decoupled from short scale fluctuations , and that these latter ones exhibit kpz roughness .",
    "an almost identical calculation leads us to the same conclusion here : local and global dynamics are decoupled ; on the one hand there are facets and on the other there are short - scale kpz - like fluctuations .",
    "therefore , we have not found any evidence of a continuous transitions nor of roughness exponents around @xmath142 , characteristic of the dpd class in the negative case , and we can safely conclude that the two cases , with positive and negative non - linearities are clearly different . obviously , the origin in this difference stems from the facet formation in the negative case ; thus it would be reasonable to conjecture that by running simulations in tilted systems with a tilt equal or larger to the critical slope there should not be an abrupt transition between faceted and non - faceted / moving interfaces .",
    "one should not observe a continuous transition and exponent values at the transition point compatible with dpd class , as indeed numerically verified in @xcite .    beside of this new study",
    ", some important questions remain unsolved and the study of interfaces in random media remains an intriguing research area .",
    "for example , analyzing in detail what happens in physically - more - relevant higher dimensional systems ( e.g. in two dimensions ) where pinning paths ( and thus dpd ) are expected to be replaced by `` pinning surfaces '' @xcite is left for a future work .",
    "interestingly , a similar physical situation arises in the study of kpz interfaces bounded by a wall which is relevant in the study of non - equilibrium wetting @xcite and synchronization transitions @xcite . under these circumstances , the case @xmath29 has been shown to be radically different from the @xmath30 one ; the corresponding associated problems have very different physical behavior and they belong to two distinct universality classes @xcite . therefore , it seems that under diverse circumstances , positive and negative kpz non - linearities describe very different situations .",
