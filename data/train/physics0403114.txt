    "the positron may also temporarily capture one of the atomic electrons in a process known as virtual positronium formation .",

    "in this paper we have formulated a many - body theory approach which accounts for the main correlation effects in positron - atom interactions .",
    "these are ( i ) polarisation of the target by the positron , ( ii ) virtual positronium formation , and ( iii ) strong enhancement of the electron - positron contact density due to their coulomb interaction .",
    "the key development for an accurate description of ( ii ) and ( iii ) is the summation of the ladder diagram series and calculation of the electron - positron vertex function .",
    "b - spline basis sets and extrapolation over the orbital angular momenta are used to achieve convergence of the sums over the electron and positron intermediate states .",

    "correlation corrections to the annihilation vertex , which are physically related to the virtual ps formation , are even more important .",
    "they enhance the annihilation rate in hydrogen by a factor of 5 or more , depending on the positron partial wave .",
    "such vertex corrections depend weakly on the positron energy , and the enhancement they produce is practically the same for various positron wavefunctions .",
    "therefore , one could use the average enhancement factors derived for isolated atoms to obtain reliable annihilation rates for atoms placed in different environments , provided that a sufficiently accurate single - particle positron wavefunction is available .",
    "of course , different atomic subshells will be characterised by different enhancement factors .",
    "however , they can all be determined in an many - body calculations of the type described in this paper , and serve as an input for the calculations of positron annihilation in molecules or condensed matter .    in this work",

    "we have also derived the equivalent local enhancement factor and compared it with an expression used in condensed matter calculations .",
    "similar comparisons for larger many - electron targets may test various forms of enhancement factors in a much greater range of electron densities .    the rapid development of computers over the past few decades seems to have favoured theoretical methods other than many - body theory .",
    "such methods often rely more on the computer power and numerical techniques than on the physical insight .",
    "they often appear to be `` more exact '' than the sophisticated but explicitly approximate many - body theory approaches , and promise improved results due to shear growth of computer power .",
