    "biological systems perform switching operations quite efficiently , albeit at lower speeds and targeting very specific applications as opposed to universal logic . nonetheless , the principles that many biological systems utilize are quite instructive - notable among them being the use of analog encoding of signals , and the employment of strongly non - equilibrium power sources . brownian motors use non - equilibrium noise to create directed motion @xcite to fuel the motion of motor proteins @xcite and drive ion flow in artificial nanopores @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the distinct energy advantages of extending ratchet principles to solid - state electronics , specifically the shuttling of charges without a global drain bias under non - equilibrium conditions @xcite .",
    "we find two distinct advantages of an electronic ratchet related to its device level energetics .",
    "first , the absence of a drain bias needed to create global directionality reduces the static dissipation during device operation . in purely current - controlled logic ( e.g. a binary decision diagram or bdd ) , this is a distinct advantage . in a conventional cmos incarnation however , charging an output capacitor converts this current source into an effective drain voltage . at this stage ,",
    "the second advantage of a ratchet comes in - a voltage - controlled current source dissipates less energy when charging the capacitor , and is amenable to adiabatic charging .",
    "conventional schemes for adiabatic charging require precise timing information for signal synchronization ; since we wait till each capacitor charges up adequately , such a timing requirement is not demanded of our proposed ratchet .",
    "[ t ]     figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows a possible implementation of a ratchet based switch .",
    "we have a dual gated device with a top and a back gate capacitor .",
    "the top gate , consisting of interdigitated metal plates , creates a spatially asymmetric potential - obtained by solving laplace s equation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : digitated ] ) .",
    "an ac signal applied to these plates creates a clock that raises and lowers the potential barriers periodically . the ratchet mechanism ( described in the next section )",
    "creates a net non - zero dc current averaged over space and time , and this current progressively builds up a charge on the back gate capacitor .",
    "the back gate capacitor represents the input gate to the next ratchet in series ( not shown ) , moving its fermi energy and turning it on so that the second ratchet can now start shuttling charges . a suitable layout of a ratchet array",
    "can then realize a nand , a nor or other generic boolean logic gates .",
    "we consider only a specific subset of all possible ratchet types - ` flashing ratchets ' .",
    "[ fig : ratchet_basic ] shows the basic operation of a flashing ratchet and how the particles will accumulate around a single potential minimum .",
    "however in a real device the particles will be distributed equally to every minima .",
    "a periodic potential with built - in local asymmetry is created by a sequence of interdigitated electrodes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : digitated ] ) . when the barriers are fully raised , the carriers injected into the channel localize around the potential minima ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ratchet_basic]b ) .",
    "when the applied ac clock lowers the barriers ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ratchet_basic]c ) , the carriers spread out in both left and right directions , driven by thermal diffusion in the classical limit and by wave packet evolution in the quantum limit , driven by the difference in phase velocities of the individual fourier components .",
    "when the potential is turned back on again , the carriers drift down to their nearest valleys ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ratchet_basic]d ) . owing to the local asymmetry of the potential profile",
    ", there will be more carriers that have crossed the top of the barriers into each valley compared to the barrier sitting further , because the diffusion occurs when the barriers are down .",
    "in other words , there is a progressive space - time averaged movement of charges unidirectionally _ even in the absence of a source - drain bias _",
    ", driven simply by the non - equilibrium signal supplied by the clock",
    ".    the action of a ratchet can thus be described as a clock - driven current , that can be used to build an open - circuit voltage @xmath0 across a capacitor in a logic circuit .",
    "as the voltage builds on the capacitor , it creates a back - flow until the reverse bias current cancels the ratchet current upon complete charging of the capacitive load .",
    "a large open circuit voltage allows the ratchet to drive the next stage , but this efficiency needs to be counter weighed against the corresponding energy dissipated and the charging delay associated with building the voltage .",

    "a purely ballistic quantum evolution , described above , does not have an inbuilt mechanism for relaxing the charges . as a result ,",
    "our simulations show that the process of continuously pumping energy into the ratchet from an ac field causes the carriers to heat up and eventually fly off the barriers .",
    "we thus need a way to remove the excess energy at the end of each ac cycle .",
    "coupling the electrons with substrate phonons would remove that energy .",
    "rather than modeling this complex behavior , we capture this relaxation using a ` one - shot ' procedure , where at the end of each clock cycle , we reset the electron distribution to the initial equilibrium solution . the energy difference between the equilibrium eigenvalue and that reached at the end of the ac cycle is the dissipation that we can then keep track of .",

    "periodic boundary conditions are invoked by setting @xmath37 , while open boundary conditions require self - energy matrices with @xmath38 .",
    "while periodic boundary conditions suffice to see the shuttling of charges , and in addition provide analytical simplicity for a closed circuit , there is a danger of tails of the wavefunction escaping a drain and re - injected from the source towards a valley and self - interfering , an issue that open boundary conditions do not run into .",
    "this becomes a bigger issue if we let the charges build up at the end for an open circuit , whereupon the periodic boundary conditions can not even be justified .",

    "classically we keep track of the charges rather than wavefunctions , and evolve them by the newtonian drift - diffusion equation @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the carrier distribution , @xmath41 is the electric field , @xmath42 is the carrier mobility , and d is the diffusion constant .",

    "the gaussian distributed particles initially localize in the second well ( l @xmath48 ) and start to diffuse both sides at t = 0.003 ns equally .",
    "as the potential starts to turn on between 0.02 ns and 0.08 ns , a small amount of particles ( due to asymmetry of potential ) quickly drift down the steeper slope ( thin dark blue to cyan ) followed by a slower , positive drift movement of a larger group of particles ( red / orange to yellow ) resulting in a net positive forward - flow . at t",
    "= 0.157 ns , the potential is lowered down and the diffusion starts , helping the two - phase drift current .",
    "as shown in the current figures of fig .",
    "[ fig : jxt]e , the net flow of particles is caused mostly by the drift current ( fig .",

    "the boundary condition at the contacts is set to describe carrier recombination in the relaxation time approximation @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the time it takes for the electrons to transfer from the semiconductor to the capacitor . in these simulations ,",
    "we use copper as the capacitive material for the back gate of the next ratchet ( see table [ table1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "this boundary condition occurs because of the interface between the ratchet channel and contact , and it usually limits the amount of charge which can flow in and out of the capacitor .",
    "however , in our simulations , the charge extraction rate for copper was fast enough to allow all charge carriers to ( dis)charge the capacitor .",
    "therefore , the contact interface did not limit the current flow between the capacitor and the ratchet .    in order to capture the charging process of the load capacitor ,",
    "the number of charges accumulating on the capacitor was calculated as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 represents the current density crossing the boundary at the end of each time step , @xmath16 is the channel cross sectional area , and @xmath53 is the simulation time step . using this we can calculate the voltage increase as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the load capacitance .",
    "we then superimpose a backward voltage varying linearly from 0 to @xmath56 across the ratchet ( ideally , by solving poisson s equation , but simplified in our treatment here ) , and add it to the sawtooth potential to give a tilted asymmetric potential .",

    "[ eqn : carrier ] until the capacitor is charged under open bias and the net _ space - time - averaged current _ vanishes ( shown in fig . [ fig : capcharge ] ) .",
    "note that there is still dynamic current flow and associated dissipation .",
    "charging of the load capacitor increases the voltage on one side of the ratchet , resulting in a tilted potential growing with time across the device .",
    "the resulting reverse current partially cancels out the directional current from the ratchet .",
    "eventually , the capacitor reaches a critical voltage , called the open circuit voltage ( @xmath0 ) when the reverse current equals the current generated by the ratchet , averaged over space and time .",
    "it is therefore important to extract the open circuit voltage to understand the drivability of the ratchet device for logic .",
    ".simulation parameters for drift - diffusion refer to table ii for circuit parameters [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      in cmos logic circuits , dynamic power dissipation results from the charging and discharging of load capacitors .",
    "take the inverter in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]a for example .",
    "when the inverter has an input of 0 , the load capacitor is charged to @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , the energy dissipated is given by : @xmath58 this energy is dissipated in the form of heat due to the effective resistance of system .",
    "the dissipated power is given by the equation @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the operating frequency of the cmos circuit .",
    "an alternative method of charging which reduces the dynamic dissipation is using a _ voltage - controlled current source _ like the electronic ratchet .",
    "it will be shown in section iii - c that a load capacitor charged through a voltage - controlled current source is : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the maximum current through the ratchet when the load capacitor is uncharged ( i.e. , the short - circuit current ) , @xmath0 is the final open circuit voltage across the ratchet , and r is the external interconnect resistance . while @xmath0 effectively plays the role of a drain bias that develops across the ratchet , with a magnitude that is set by the desired on - off ratio , the added term in the denominator helps shave off some of the dynamic power dissipation .",
    "[ t ]     another way to further reduce this dissipated energy is a method known as adiabatic charging @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b shows an example of an adiabatic cmos circuit , where the dc power source has been replaced by an oscillating signal , known as a clock .",
    "now let s assume that the input is 0 as the clock begins to ramp up .",
    "if it takes @xmath63 for the load capacitor to charge to @xmath64 , then the energy dissipated during the charging process can be given as : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a factor which is dependent on the shape of the waveform of the clock @xcite .",
    "notice that by increasing @xmath67 , we can reduce the dissipated energy indefinitely . however , one of the drawbacks of adiabatic cmos is that it requires timing information for the inputs in order to maintain adiabatic operation .",
    "for example , it is important that we turn on the transistor when the clock is ramping up .",
    "if we had instead turned on the transistor when the clock was at its maximum voltage , then there would have been a large voltage drop across the effective resistance of the circuit , leading to non - adiabatic dissipation .    in the electronic ratchet , the time - varying asymmetric potential acts as the clock in an analogous fashion as the adiabatic cmos .",
    "however , as we showed in section ii , _ the input of the ratchet is decoupled from the charging process of the output_. this allows us to take advantage of the adiabatic charging without imposing timing constraints on the inputs . in fig .",
    "[ fig : symbol ] , a circuit symbol of electronic ratchet is presented showing the input and output ports .      consider a simple circuit model in which an electronic ratchet charges a capacitor , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratchetiv ] . the i - v characteristic of the electronic ratchet is also shown .",
    "we can write the kirchoff s equations as follows to describe this circuit @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the current , @xmath56 is the voltage of the node between the electronic ratchet and the resistor and @xmath70 is the voltage on the capacitor .",
    "[ t ] , initially when the capacitor is uncharged .",
    "as the voltage builds up , the reverse current decreases the net current , until the capacitor reaches the open circuit voltage , @xmath0 when there is a zero net current.,title=\"fig : \" ]    from the equations ( [ eqn : resistor]-[eqn : capacitor ] ) , the voltage on the capacitor , @xmath70 , and current , @xmath69 can be solved as @xmath71 in which @xmath72    therefore , the energy charged into the capacitor is @xmath73 and the dissipated energy on the resistor is @xmath74 from this equation , we make the following observations . in a ratchet , the load capacitor is charged to @xmath0 rather than @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , the ratchet energetics are comparable to cmos circuits with extremely low drain - source voltages . furthermore , the ratchet introduces an extra resistance term , @xmath75 which decreases the energy dissipation further . for our simulations ( see section 3 ) ,",
    "the channel resistance was 1.39 k@xmath76 compared to the extra resistance term of 2.70 k@xmath76 .",
    "therefore , the unique charging method of the ratchet makes it intrinsically less dissipative than conventional cmos logic .",
    "we will now develop a more accurate circuit model for the ratchet ( fig .",
    "[ fig : circuit ] ) to describe its energetics during adiabatic charging .",
    "an lc circuit is used to represent the oscillating clock for the top gate . this clock charges up the top gate capacitor , which represents the charging or discharging of the asymmetric ratchet potential .",
    "because the circuit is operating at the natural frequency , we are able to adiabatically transport electrons in the channel , thus reducing the energy dissipation of the circuit .",
    "[ t ]     the asymmetry of the ratchet potential provides directionality to the electrons and gives a net positive current .",
    "this asymmetry is captured by a ( virtual ) schottky diode , which allows current to flow easily in one direction while acting as a rectifier in the opposite direction .",

    "while the creation of a clock - driven current source in the absence of a drain bias seems like a distinct net positive , by transducing that current into a capacitive voltage ( influenced by a design that is ultimately cmos - centric ) , we eventually tend to neutralize that advantage .",
    "as the ratchet system pumps electrons into the load capacitor , it builds up an open circuit voltage over time .",
    "this built - up voltage , however , acts as an effective drain bias which reintroduces the static dissipation into the logic circuit .",
    "therefore , an alternative method of implementing logic circuits should be devised to mitigate this issue .",
    "it might be possible to create a current - based logic system which would eschew the static dissipation , at least for several intermediate logic stages .",
    "for now , we present this simple method as a demonstration of ratchet logic design , but ref .",
    "@xcite shows that power efficient computation with limited number of electrons can be achieved in a ratchet - like geometry through the use of purely current driven binary decision design ( bdd ) circuits .",
    "biological systems are rife with examples where ratchet - like mechanisms are purported to shuttle elements ( typically motor proteins ) in the absence of global potentials , powered by non - equilibrium signals such as the hydrolysis of atp over a finite noise frequency range @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper was four - fold : ( a ) to extend this concept to a solid - state device , using a clock and a series of potentials created by interdigitated electrodes ; ( b ) to show how such a ratchet device can be cascaded to create universal boolean logic ; ( c ) to explain the possible energy - saving advantages raising from the reduced dynamic and static dissipation ; and ( d ) finally , to outline limitations exposed by the simulations of our studied device geometries , namely , the importance of switching in future to current - driven ( as opposed to voltage - driven ) logic , and the need to achieve a temporal matching or resonance between driving and driven frequencies .",
