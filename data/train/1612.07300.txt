    "the @xmath0{th}$ ] isotope is unique throughout the entire nuclear chart due to its first nuclear excited state lying energetically in the optical range  @xcite . in the language of nuclear physics",
    ", this state is an isomer , i.e. , a long - lived excited nuclear state . at present",
    "the most accepted value for the energy of this level is @xmath3  ev  @xcite , rendering it accessible to vacuum ultra - violet ( vuv ) lasers . due to the very low transition energy , the radiative decay of the state",
    "is strongly suppressed leading to an exceptionally long lifetime of the isomer .",
    "the ratio of radiative width to transition energy is presently estimated at @xmath4 . given this very narrow width and the high robustness of nuclei to external perturbations @xcite ,",
    "the isomeric state has been proposed for novel applications such as a nuclear frequency standard with unprecedented accuracy @xcite or a nuclear laser  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "these features render a direct spectroscopic search for the nuclear resonance with a narrow - band laser extremely tedious .",
    "a coarse determination of the isomer energy or a restriction of the search range would therefore be extremely helpful .    since the nuclear transition energy lies above the first ionization threshold of th ( see table  [ ionpot ] )",
    ", the decay of the nuclear state can occur not only radiatively but also via internal conversion ( ic ) . in the process of ic ,",
    "the nuclear transition energy is transferred to a bound electron in the atom , which is then ionized . in the case of @xmath0{th}$ ] , the 7.8  ev can be transferred to one of the valence electrons , which then leaves the atom .",
    "this decay channel is much stronger than the radiative decay , with an ic coefficient , i.e. , the ratio of the ic rate to the radiative decay rate of the same transition , of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "typically , in the process of ic the initial electronic state is the ground state of the atom . due to the very low - lying nuclear excited state , @xmath0{th}$ ] is a unique candidate for investigating ic of electrons from an excited electronic state .",
    "optical or vuv lasers can be used to excite the atomic shell and maintain the outermost electrons available for ic in excited states .",
    "this opportunity exists and is relevant only for @xmath0{th}$ ] , since for higher nuclear transition energies mostly electrons from inner shells of the ground - state electronic configuration are ionized .",
    "practically , inner - shell vacancies are notoriously short - lived and excited electronic configurations can not be maintained long enough for ic to occur . in this work",
    "we investigate this unique feature of @xmath0{th}$ ] to design new possible means to detect the isomeric state via observation of ic from excited electronic configurations .",
    "better knowledge of the isomeric state energy and its properties is required for all nuclear quantum optics applications based on the @xmath0{th}$ ] isomeric transition proposed so far .",
    "several approaches have been pursued , for example atomic spectroscopy of trapped th ions  @xcite and laser spectroscopy of th nuclei grown in vuv - transparent crystal lattices  @xcite .",
    "significant progress has been recently achieved by the detection of the ic electrons from the isomeric state in neutral @xmath0{th}$ ] atoms  @xcite .",
    "this result is considered to be the first direct observation of the low - energy isomeric state of @xmath0{th}$ ] .",
    "however , direct or indirect excitation of the isomeric state has not been achieved so far  @xcite , raising the question of whether the isomeric energy lies somewhat higher than the region thus far considered  @xcite .",
    "an experimental confirmation of the @xmath6{th}$ ] isomeric state energy and lifetime thus remains a very important experimental challenge .",
    "here we envisage a new possible approach to detect the isomeric state taking advantage of ic from excited electronic states .",
    "ic is energetically allowed in the neutral atom , but should be forbidden in th ions , as shown by the ionization potential values tabulated in table  [ ionpot ] .",
    "thus , ic from the electronic ground state becomes energetically forbidden for higher degrees of ionization so that _ only _ ic from excited states remains allowed .",
    "if a @xmath6{th}$ ] ion prepared in an excited electronic state undergoes ic at a rate fast enough compared with the spontaneous decay of the electronic excited state , ions of a higher charge state will be produced in the process .",
    "detection of such ions can be performed with close - to - unity efficiency and direct comparison with the case of @xmath7{th}$ ] ( which does not possess any nuclear states at optical energies ) will indicate the presence of the isomeric state .",
    "based on the observation of occurring ic - induced ionization , one can estimate the isomeric energy and compare the ic rate with theoretical predictions . a schematic illustration of the ic from an excited electronic state of @xmath1 leading to the formation of @xmath2 ions is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "leading to the formation of @xmath2 ions .",
    "the generic electronic level scheme of the outermost three electrons is depicted in the upper part of the figure , while the lower part illustrates the ground and isomeric nuclear states .",
    "photoexcitation creates the excited electronic state in @xmath1 ( left graph ) .",
    "this opens the ic channel for the isomeric state , such that an electron is ionized ( middle graph ) producing @xmath2 ions ( right graph ) .",

    "the experimental population of the @xmath9 state of @xmath10 at 30223  @xmath11 is , at first sight , not straightforward due to the difference of the total angular momentum with respect to the ground state : @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , if one were to excite from the ground state using six resonant photon transitions , one also needs to introduce a change in parity , i.e. , one of these transitions would need to have @xmath13 multipolarity . in the following",
    "we therefore consider other possible ways to reach the level .",
    "firstly , the state of interest can be reached via three @xmath14 excitation / de - excitation steps from the @xmath15 excited level at 6213  @xmath11 as indicated in the possible laser excitation scheme in fig .",
    "[ laserscheme ] .",
    "the levels at 30310  @xmath11 and 42645  @xmath11 can serve as intermediate stages , so that one can use two laser excitations with wavelengths of 415 nm and 811 nm , followed by one induced de - excitation at 805  nm .",
    "we note that the dynamics of laser de - excitation ( from rydberg levels ) has been investigated in connection with anti - hydrogen atoms @xcite .",
    "all of the wavelengths are easily produced using ti : sapphire lasers  @xcite , one of which is frequency doubled .",
    "the @xmath15 state at 6213  @xmath11 has only one @xmath14 decay channel at the extremely low photon energy of @xmath16  ev and very low decay rate of @xmath17 @xmath18 , so it can be considered as metastable .    the electronic level at 6213  @xmath11 has a total angular momentum 9/2 and even parity",
    ". it can be reached with four laser ( de)excitations in the following manner : an excitation from the ground state to an odd parity 3/2 level at 26965  @xmath11 ( 371  nm ) , a second excitation step to an even parity 5/2 state at 40644  @xmath11 ( 731  nm ) , a stimulated de - excitation to an odd parity 7/2 state at 18974  @xmath11 ( 461  nm ) and finally a de - excitation to the even parity 9/2 level at 6213  @xmath11 ( 784  nm ) , all of which are suitable for ti : sapphire lasers .",
    "nevertheless , such an excitation scheme would require 4 different lasers and though possible , subsequent optical excitation from the metastable level towards the state of interest at 30223  @xmath11 is simply impractical .",
    "alternative means to populate the 6213  @xmath11 state will require experimental investigation and thus we simply highlight them here :    * following the @xmath19-decay of a source of @xmath20{u}$ ] ( which proceeds , following gamma - ray de - excitation , primarily to the ground state of @xmath0{th}$ ] with a 2% branching to the low - energy isomeric state @xcite ) the @xmath0{th}$ ] recoils may be stopped in a buffer gas cell @xcite .",
    "excitation of the 6213  @xmath11 state may occur via collisions in the gas cell ; * excitation of the nuclear isomeric state of the ion @xmath0{th}^+$ ] through an electron bridge scheme chosen such that the final electronic level is not the ground state , but the state at 6213  @xmath11 ( this would work for particular values of @xmath21 ) ; * thermal excitation to the metastable level via laser ablation of @xmath0{th}$ ] from a dried thorium nitrate solution deposited on a tungsten or tantalum substrate .",
    "this has recently been realized for the study of isotope shifts and hyperfine structures of resonance lines in @xmath0{th}^+$ ] , with a low pressure argon buffer gas used to cool the ions to room temperature and quench the population of metastable states optically pumped by the laser excitation  @xcite . in the current proposal",
    "however population of the metastable state is a requirement .",
    "state starting from the @xmath15 state at 6213  @xmath11 .",
    "[ laserscheme],width=340 ]",
    "we propose to perform an experimental verification of the internal conversion from the aforementioned excited state of @xmath0{th}^+$ ] at the igisol facility , jyvskyl , finland .",
    "the study of thorium through laser spectroscopic techniques is an ongoing project at the facility , whereby an alternative to the direct detection of the isomeric decay would be the inference , through an optical measurement , of the atomic hyperfine structure . due to different spins and magnetic moments of the ground- and isomeric state",
    "( the latter produced via the alpha decay of @xmath20{u}$ ] ) , such a measurement will allow the separation and identification of the two states @xcite . a description of the current facility and the historical developments leading towards the ion guide method of radioactive ion beam production are described in  @xcite and references therein .",
    "figure  [ laserline ] illustrates the layout of the facility of specific relevance to our proposal .",
    "following population of the metastable level at 6213  @xmath11 in @xmath0{th}$ ] ( see previous section ) , the @xmath0{th}^+$ ] ion beam is injected into the radiofrequency ( rf ) quadrupole cooler - buncher  @xcite . inside this device , the ions lose their residual energy through viscous collisions with low pressure ( @xmath221 mbar ) helium gas , and a weak axial field is applied to the segmented electrodes in order to guide the ions to the exit region within 1 ms . here",
    ", the ions may be accumulated with a trapping potential and are bunched before extraction through a miniature quadrupole into a low - energy transfer line operating at 800 v before re - acceleration by the platform potential ( @xmath2230 kv ) towards the experimental setups .",
    "the time structure of a typical ion bunch has been determined to be @xmath2210 @xmath23s .    in recent years , a method of optical pumping within the rf cooler - buncher in connection with collinear laser spectroscopy has been pioneered in jyvskyl  @xcite . generally , laser spectroscopy is performed using electronic transitions from the ground state due to reasons of population . in order to access a wider number of elements for nuclear structure interest , excitation of ground states within the cooler - buncher using laser light generated from high power pulsed tunable ti : sapphire lasers results in optical pumping and efficient redistribution of the ground state population to a selected metastable state .",
    "importantly , the state survives extraction from the cooler , acceleration and delivery to the collinear set - up , the general beamline layout of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ laserline ] .        in the near future",
    ", much effort will be directed towards the production of pure beams of a single isotope or even isomer .",
    "this will be realized through a multi - step excitation process with typically three pulsed lasers being used to resonantly ionize a selected element from a singly - charged to a doubly - charged state while inside the cooler , effectively an extension of the optical manipulation used to populate selected metastable states .",
    "this method is similar to that proposed for the population of the @xmath9 state of @xmath10 at 30223  @xmath11 from the metastable 6213  @xmath11 state .",
    "when the ions are released from the cooler in bunches , their time - of - flight to the detection region ( a multi - channel plate , mcp , detector located at the end of the beamline ) depends on the mass - to - charge ratio , @xmath24 .",
    "doubly - charged ions , in this instance @xmath0{th}^{2+}$ ] which is produced via ic from the excited 30223  @xmath11 state , will leave the cooler more quickly .",
    "the doubly - charged ion bunch will rapidly become spatially separated from the bunch of contaminant singly - charged ions thus allowing the latter to be electrostatically deflected from the beam path .",
    "the typical flight time from the ion beam cooler - buncher to the mcp detector shown in fig .",
    "[ laserline ] for a mass @xmath25=100 singly - charged ion is 100 @xmath23s .",
    "this flight time scales with the square root of @xmath24 and thus for singly - charged @xmath0{th}^+$ ] the expected flight time increases to approx .",
    "the corresponding flight time for doubly - charged @xmath0{th}^{2+}$ ] is approx .",
    "this difference in the ion bunch arrival time is sufficient for a simple electrostatic deflection of one species and therefore a clear identification of the presence of the isomeric state can be made .",
    "it is expected that background doubly - charged ions may be formed inside the cooler - buncher via resonant excitation and ionization of singly - charged thorium .",
    "this process will be studied in detail using stable @xmath7{th}^+$ ] which does not possess any nuclear states at optical energies .",
    "the low - lying isomeric state of @xmath0{th}$ ] opens the possibility to observe for the first time ic from excited electronic states .",
    "we have investigated how this process can be used for an estimate of the nuclear transition energy and an experimental determination of the nuclear transition strength .",
    "the scenario put forward involves laser excitation of the electronic shell in thorium ions , which subsequently opens the ic decay channel of the isomeric state .",
    "experimentally , the decay of the nuclear excited state could be then observed via the appearance and detection of ions belonging to the next charged state .",
    "numerical results for ic rates from excited states of @xmath0{th}^{+}$ ] and @xmath0{th}^{2+}$ ] ions have been presented . a possible experimental setup for the determination of the isomeric state properties using ic from excited electronic states at the igisol facility , jyvskyl , finland , has been discussed .",
    "the main challenge here appears to be the laser excitation of the electronic shell to states which live long enough to allow for ic to efficiently depopulate the isomeric state .",
    "in addition , we note that new laser spectroscopy data for @xmath0{th}^{+}$ ] and @xmath0{th}^{2+}$ ] electronic excited states above 60000 @xmath26 might enlarge the choice of states that can be used for the proposed scheme , if additional longer - lived excited electronic states are found .",
    "further experimental data at higher excitation energies is also important in the search for an electron bridge mechanism for the isomeric state and further laser spectroscopy scans are continuing at the moment ."
