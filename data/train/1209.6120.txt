    "the reader is referred to recent surveys by allaart and kawamura @xcite and lagarias @xcite for various properties and applications of the takagi function .",
    "recent research has focused mainly on the level sets @xmath12:t(x)=y\\}$ ] .",
    "many authors ( e.g. kahane @xcite , baba @xcite ) have pointed out that the maximum value of @xmath13 is @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is a cantor set of hausdorff dimension @xmath16 .",
    "recently , de amo et al .",
    "@xcite proved that @xmath16 is in fact the largest dimension of any level set of @xmath13 , improving on a result of maddock @xcite .",
    "the cardinalities of the level sets of @xmath13 have also been investigated .",
    "buczolich @xcite showed that @xmath17 is finite for lebesgue - almost every @xmath8 .",
    "the present author studied the level sets further and proved , among other things , that every even positive integer occurs as the cardinality of some level set @xcite , and that the set of ordinates @xmath8 such that @xmath17 is infinite is residual in the range of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "another result along these lines , due to lagarias and maddock @xcite , is that the set of ordinates @xmath8 for which @xmath17 has strictly positive hausdorff dimension is of full hausdorff dimension 1 .",
    "lagarias and maddock @xcite also introduced the interesting concept of a _ local level set _ of the takagi function .",
    "local level sets are subsets of ( global ) level sets whose members are obtained from one another by simple combinatorial operations on their binary expansions .",
    "local level sets have a particularly simple structure : they are either finite or cantor sets . in @xcite , it is shown that the average number of local level sets contained in a level set of @xmath13 is @xmath9 . on the other hand",

    "* theorem ix.6.4 ) ) , since @xmath6 is nowhere differentiable and hence of unbounded variation , so that @xmath64    while theorem [ thm : finite - ae ] is of a probabilistic nature , the baire category view gives a rather different picture .",

    "thus , theorems [ thm : finite - ae ] and [ thm : uncountables ] can be stated equivalently by saying that for lebesgue - almost every @xmath8 , @xmath23 consists _ entirely _ of isolated points , but for a set of @xmath8-values residual in the range of @xmath6 , @xmath23 has _ no _ isolated points .",
