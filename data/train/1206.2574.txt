    "the energy of a map from one manifold to another is a measure of the total stretching of the map .",
    "energy minimizing harmonic maps have found numerous applications in geometry , analysis , algebra and topology .",
    "the two survey papers of eells and lemaire @xcite give an introduction to the extensive literature of this subject .",
    "one of the fundamental existence theorems states that a nontrivial map of a riemannian manifold @xmath0 to a negatively curved manifold @xmath1 is homotopic to a unique harmonic map .",
    "when @xmath0 is a surface , each conformal class of metrics on @xmath0 gives rise to the same map , and smooth families of domains give rise to smooth families of harmonic maps @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a new type of energy that leads to what we call a _ simplicial harmonic map_. the key idea is to give a new , more combinatorial , definition of area , and then find a corresponding definition for energy .",
    "the payoff is that the existence and regularity of simplicial harmonic maps are simple to prove , but they retain enough of the features of smooth harmonic maps to be useful in applications . in this paper",
    "we focus on maps from surfaces into non - positively curved manifolds and spaces .",
    "we briefly discuss extensions to maps between manifolds of any dimension .",
    "one motivation for studying energy from a more combinatorial point of view is to obtain numerical methods for computing minimal and harmonic surfaces .",
    "this was carried out in the work of pinkall and polthier @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a survey of related work .",
    "the discrete harmonic maps of pinkall and polthier are maps of a triangulation of a domain surface into @xmath2 that are linear on each @xmath3simplex .",
    "their formula gives the natural energy for a piecewise - linear approximation of a smooth map , and has found many uses in computational geometry @xcite , where harmonic maps give a preferred choice of surface map for purposes such as texturing and meshing .",
    "while the pinkall - polthier harmonic maps retain many of the useful features of smooth harmonic maps , particularly when the @xmath3simplices in the domain are acute angled , they do not in general satisfy the convex hull or mean value properties .",
    "( see section  [ meanvalueandconvexhullproperties ] for a discussion of these properties and their consequences . )",
    "an example of polthier and rossman @xcite shows that a discrete harmonic map may fail to satisfy the convex hull property , with an interactive demonstration available at @xcite .",
    "the simplicial harmonic maps we describe in this paper are defined for very general target spaces and do satisfy a convex hull property .",
    "a consequence is that if @xmath4 is a simplicial harmonic immersion of a surface @xmath0 into a riemannian manifold @xmath1 , then the induced curvature on @xmath0 is more negative than the sectional curvature of @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath1 itself is negatively curved , the gauss - bonnet theorem then implies that the area of @xmath4 is bounded above by a constant times the euler characteristic of @xmath0 .",
    "when mapped into euclidean space , simplicial harmonic maps also satisfy a mean value property and the maximum principle .    in this paper",
    ", we use the completeness and non - positive curvature of a riemannian manifold @xmath1 to conclude that each homotopy class of arcs in @xmath1 contains a unique geodesic representative ( rel boundary ) .",
    "there are other conditions that imply this property , and our construction then immediately applies .",
    "for example , teichmuller space with either the teichmuller metric or the weil - peterson metric has a unique geodesic connecting any two points @xcite , although the weil - peterson metric is not complete .",
    "similarly , any two points in the interior of a hemisphere are connected by a unique geodesic arc .",
    "more generally , our methods work equally well if @xmath1 is a metrized graph , a @xmath5 space , or a path metric space with the property that any two points are joined by a unique geodesic in each homotopy class .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "initially we consider maps of triangulated compact surfaces into manifolds . in section [ simplicialarea ]",
    "we define the simplicial area of a map , and in section [ simplicialenergy ] we define simplicial energy . in section [ polygonaldecompositions ]",
    "we briefly discuss how to define simplicial area and energy of maps when the source surface is divided into polygons which need not be triangles . in section [ simplicialharmonic ]",
    "we define simplicial harmonic maps . in section [ meanvalueandconvexhullproperties ]",
    "we establish the mean value and convex hull properties of simplicial harmonic maps .",
    "in section  [ families ] we consider the problem of deforming families of surfaces in @xmath6manifolds to surfaces of small area . given any surface in a @xmath6manifold , it is possible to find a homotopy that deforms the surface to a collection of minimal surfaces joined by thin tubes . in a hyperbolic @xmath6manifold , there is a universal upper bound for the area of such a surface in terms of its euler characteristic @xmath7 ; a surface with @xmath8 can be homotoped to have area at most @xmath9 .",
    "but there is no canonical homotopy to such a small area surface . for many applications one would like to start with a family of surfaces and",
    "continuously homotope the entire family of surfaces so that each surface in the family has small area .",
    "area deformation techniques based on mean curvature and related flows are not well suited to such a process , due to the formation of singularities and the non - uniqueness of least area surfaces in a homotopy class . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that smooth energy deformation techniques based on analytic results of eells and sampson @xcite can be applied successfully in this context .",
    "we show that a simplified theory based on simplicial energy suffices to give a deformation of a family of surfaces to a family of small area surfaces",
    ". then we extend this discussion to explain how the smooth energy deformation techniques in @xcite can be replaced by simpler simplicial techniques .    in section [ genus ]",
    "we introduce the idea of the genus of an @xmath10dimensional manifold , extending the notion of heegaard genus from dimension three to all dimensions .",
    "we find connections between this @xmath10dimensional genus and the areas of surfaces in a sweepout of an @xmath10manifold .",
    "the simplicial energy of a map depends on the choice of a simplicial metric on its domain . in section",
    "[ limits ] we show the existence of maps which are global minimizers of simplicial energy over the space of all simplicial metrics . in section  [ diffeo ]",
    "we consider the problem of finding canonical parametrizations , or canonical triangulations of a surface .",
    "we solve this by showing that if a simplicial harmonic map from a closed surface of negative euler characteristic to a non - positively curved riemannian surface is homotopic to a homeomorphism , then it is itself a homeomorphism .",
    "then we give applications of this result to study the space of straight triangulations of a compact surface @xmath0 with a riemannian metric of non - positive curvature .",
    "( a triangulation of @xmath0 is called straight if each edge is a geodesic arc . )",
    "we show that the space of straight triangulations of @xmath0 of a fixed combinatorial type is connected .",
    "we note that in the case when @xmath0 is the disk with a flat metric , bloch , connelly and henderson @xcite proved much more , showing that this space is homeomorphic to some euclidean space and so contractible . we thank igor rivin for telling us about this work , and for suggesting that our ideas could be useful for studying the space of straight triangulations of more general surfaces .",
    "finally , in section [ higherdimensions ] we briefly discuss generalizations to maps of higher dimensional manifolds .",
    "in this section we define the simplicial area of a compact @xmath3dimensional surface @xmath0 . in place of a riemannian metric on @xmath0 , we specify a triangulation @xmath11 and a map @xmath12 that assigns to each edge @xmath13 , @xmath14 , of @xmath11 a length @xmath15 , with the lengths @xmath16 satisfying the triangle inequality for each triangle of @xmath11 .",
    "we call such an assignment a _ simplicial metric _ on @xmath0 , and denote it by @xmath17 , or just @xmath12 when the context is clear",
    ". note that we allow the possibility that for some triangles one of the triangle inequalities is an equality .",
    "we do not require the triangulation @xmath11 to be combinatorial .",
    "thus we allow triangulations where two , or even all three , vertices of a single triangle coincide in @xmath0 , or where a pair of triangles intersect in two or three vertices .",
    "but we assume that @xmath11 has the structure of a @xmath18complex @xcite .",
    "this is not a serious restriction .",
    "this means that @xmath0 is constructed from a disjoint union of triangles , each of whose vertices is ordered , by identifying faces of the triangles in an order preserving way .",
    "thus the given orderings can be extended to an ordering of all the vertices of @xmath11 . for simplicity we will always discuss triangles in @xmath19complexes as if they were embedded in @xmath0 .",
    "if a triangle is not embedded in @xmath0 , one needs to consider the source triangle in the initial disjoint union of triangles .",
    "each simplex in a @xmath19complex has a minimal ( in the given order ) vertex , which we call its preferred vertex . when considering limits of simplicial metrics , it is convenient to also allow edges in the triangulation that are assigned zero length .",
    "we call such an extension a _ simplicial quasi - metric _ on @xmath0 .",
    "we wish to assign a meaning to the area of @xmath20 .",
    "a natural choice for the area of a triangle @xmath21 with edge lengths @xmath22 is the area of the euclidean triangle with the same edge lengths .",
    "this is given by the classical heron s formula , see @xcite for example , @xmath23 we will however use an alternate formula , one that is much simpler , but still useful . we define the _ simplicial area _",
    "@xmath24 of the triangle @xmath21 by the formula@xmath25    we note that the euclidean area @xmath26 of a triangle is at most @xmath27 , for any pair @xmath28 , @xmath29 of edge lengths .",
    "so @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "equality occurs when an appropriate angle is a right angle .",
    "adding these inequalities yields the inequality@xmath33    one defect of our definition of the simplicial area of a triangle , is that if we subdivide a triangle into smaller triangles , the simplicial area is not , in general , additive .",

    "this is when we add a vertex at the midpoint of each edge of a euclidean triangle @xmath34 and subdivide @xmath21 into four similar triangles .",
    "we call this _",
    "conformal subdivision_.    another defect of our definition is that the simplicial area of a triangle can only be zero when @xmath35 .",
    "for some purposes , this is not a problem . in the cases where this is a serious problem , we use quadrilaterals rather than triangles .",

    "however the triangle inequality will prove useful , so we have built it into the definition of a simplicial metric .",

    "recall that all these lemmas consider a map @xmath567 which is the limit of the restriction to @xmath538 of a sequence of homeomorphisms from @xmath534 to @xmath533 , each of which is isotopic to @xmath4 , and whose simplicial energies approach @xmath537 .",
    "lemma [ edgesaremappedtogeodesics ] shows that any such map sends each edge of @xmath11 to a point or a geodesic segment . in the present situation",
    ", @xmath363 is a limit of simplicial homeomorphisms , so it is immediate that it sends each edge of @xmath11 to a point or a geodesic segment , but it need not have the minimal energy @xmath537 .",
    "lemma [ manyedgescollapsed ] used the least energy assumption on @xmath125 to show that if @xmath125 collapsed some edge @xmath512 to a point , then it must map the star of some complex @xmath581 which contains @xmath512 into some geodesic @xmath170 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath363 collapses some edge @xmath512 to a point .",
    "the arguments in the proof of lemma [ manyedgescollapsed ] show that either we get the same conclusion for @xmath363 , or we can isotope some @xmath257 to a simplicial homeomorphism @xmath550 whose energy is strictly less than that of @xmath363 . an alternative way of putting this is to say that either the claim holds or the result of lemma [ manyedgescollapsed ] holds for @xmath363 .",
    "lemmas [ noedgeincidenttodlcollapses ] and [ chas0or2criticalpoints ] depend on lemma [ manyedgescollapsed ] but do not otherwise use the energy minimizing assumption on @xmath125 .",
    "thus again we have that either the claim holds or their results also hold for @xmath363 .",
    "finally the arguments in the proof of lemma [ f0isahomeomorphism ] use the conclusions of lemmas [ noedgeincidenttodlcollapses ] and [ chas0or2criticalpoints ] to show that if @xmath125 is not a homeomorphism we can isotope @xmath257 to a simplicial homeomorphism @xmath550 whose energy is strictly less than that of @xmath125 . as @xmath363 is not a homeomorphism ,",
    "when we apply these arguments to @xmath363 , it follows that the claim must hold .",
    "this completes the proof of the claim , and hence of theorem [ straighttriangulationsarestraightisotopic ] .",
    "we end this section by discussing the fact that the gradient flow need not preserve the property of being a homeomorphism .",
    "recall from section [ simplicialenergy ] the formula for the simplicial energy of a map .",
    "if we consider varying a single vertex @xmath100 , only those edges incident to @xmath100 can contribute to any change in the energy .",
    "to each such edge @xmath512 we associate a vector @xmath640 in the tangent space at @xmath100 so that @xmath640 is tangent to @xmath512 , has magnitude equal to the length of @xmath512 , and points away from @xmath100 .",
    "suppose that every edge of @xmath11 has length @xmath90 in our simplicial metric .",
    "then a simple calculation shows that under the gradient flow , the flow vector of @xmath100 is simply the sum of the vectors @xmath640 .",
    "thus @xmath100 is `` pulled '' much more by long edges than by short ones .",
    "if a configuration like the one in figure  [ nonembedded ] is part of a triangulation of a surface , it will quickly cease to be embedded under the gradient flow .",
    "moves rightward faster than vertex @xmath427.,width=192 ]",
    "in the previous sections we considered maps of a triangulated closed surface @xmath0 into a non - positively curved closed manifold @xmath1 whose dimension was unrestricted . in this section",
    "we observe that all the preceding work can be generalized to maps of a triangulated closed @xmath281manifold @xmath0 into a non - positively curved manifold @xmath1 , for any @xmath641 .",
    "we do this by restricting attention to the @xmath3skeleton @xmath642 of the triangulation @xmath11 of @xmath0 .",
    "this seems reasonable as the homotopy class of a map of @xmath0 into @xmath1 is determined by its restriction to @xmath642 , as @xmath1 is aspherical . in the smooth setting",
    ", much work has been done in this setting .",
    "see @xcite@xcite .    for simplicity",
    "we discuss only the case when @xmath643 . as in the @xmath3dimensional case",
    ", we specify a triangulation @xmath11 of the closed @xmath6manifold @xmath0 , and a map @xmath12 that assigns to each edge @xmath13 , @xmath96 , of @xmath11 a length @xmath15 , with the lengths @xmath16 realizable by a euclidean tetrahedron for each tetrahedron of @xmath11 .",
    "we call such an assignment a _ simplicial metric _ on @xmath0 , and denote it by @xmath20 , or just @xmath12 when the context is clear",
    ". note that we allow the possibility that for some triangles one of the triangle inequalities is an equality . as before we order the vertices of @xmath11 using a @xmath19-complex structure .",
    "given a map @xmath38 , let @xmath39 denote the length of the restriction of @xmath4 to the edge @xmath13 , and as before define the @xmath155th stretch factor to be @xmath110 .",
    "the _ simplicial @xmath3-volume of @xmath4 _ is defined to be @xmath645 , and the _",
    "simplicial @xmath3-energy of the map @xmath4 _ to be @xmath646 , where the sum is taken over all corners of all the @xmath3simplices of @xmath11 .",
    "next we need to define when a map from @xmath0 to @xmath1 is simplicial . as before we insist that each edge of the triangulation @xmath11 is mapped to @xmath1 as a geodesic arc . in order to determine @xmath4 canonically on the remainder of @xmath0 , we use the ordering of the vertices of @xmath11 . for each triangle of @xmath11",
    "this determines a cone structure , with cone point the minimal vertex of the triangle , and as before this determines a canonical extension of @xmath4 to the @xmath3skeleton of @xmath0 .",
    "we give each tetrahedron @xmath21 of @xmath11 the cone structure from its minimal vertex @xmath143 .",
    "note that all the faces of @xmath21 which meet @xmath143 also have cone structure with @xmath143 as the cone point .",
    "thus the canonical extension of @xmath4 to the tetrahedra of @xmath11 yields a well defined simplicial map to @xmath1 .",
    "as in lemma [ e > a ] , for any simplicial metric on @xmath0 , we have the inequality @xmath647 with equality if and only if all the stretch factors are equal .",
    "we say that @xmath4 is _ @xmath3-simplicial harmonic _ if it is a critical point of the @xmath3-energy functional .",
    "as in proposition [ uniqueharmonicmapsexist ] , if @xmath1 is closed , the energy functional has a minimum among all maps homotopic to @xmath4 , and we can choose any minimizing map to be simplicial . further",
    "if @xmath1 is negatively curved and @xmath4 is nontrivial , i.e. @xmath4 can not be homotoped to have image contained in a closed geodesic , then this minimum energy simplicial map @xmath312 is unique .    as in section  [ families ] , the fact that any map @xmath38 can be homotoped to a unique simplicial map without moving the vertices allows one to construct families of harmonic maps with uniform area bounds .    in the preceding paragraphs , we prefixed @xmath3 to our definitions , because there seem to be some natural alternative definitions .",
    "for example , we could define the _",
    "simplicial @xmath6-volume _ of @xmath70 to be the sum @xmath648 , where the sum is taken over all corners of all the @xmath6simplices of @xmath11",
    ". then we would define the _",
    "simplicial @xmath6-volume of @xmath4 _ to be @xmath649 , and the _ simplicial @xmath6-energy of @xmath4 _ to be @xmath650 . in general ,",
    "if the dimension of @xmath0 equals @xmath651 , then one could similarly define the simplicial @xmath281volume of @xmath0 , and the simplicial @xmath281energy of @xmath4 , for any @xmath281 such that @xmath652 .",
    "however one can not expect there to be any connection between simplicial @xmath281volume and simplicial @xmath281energy , except when @xmath653 .",
