    "very important systems described by quantum field theories are intrinsically nonlinear ; the standard model and the quantum chromodynamics are classical examples . by exploring deeply such systems or effective nonlinear models , even at the classical level",
    ", one has shown the increasing importance of the soliton solutions ( classical solutions with finite and localized energy ) and their broad applications @xcite-@xcite .",
    "soliton solutions in quantum field theory describe , for instance , monopoles ,  magnetic vortices , instantons in quantum chromodynamics , cosmic strings and magnetic domain walls .",
    "finding exact classical solutions , particularly solitons , is one of the problems on nonlinear models with interacting fields .",
    "when one has in hands a systematic method , as the one offered by rajaraman rajaramanmethod , this task becomes easier , even though one has to explore the consequences of the classical solutions , as well as their possible realizations in the nature .",
    "as pointed out by r. rajaraman and e. weinberg @xcite , in such nonlinear models more than one time - independent classical solution can exist and each one of them corresponds to a different family of quantum states , which come into play when one performs a perturbation around those classical solutions .",
    "the method in @xcite , usually called _ trial orbits method _ , is a very powerful one presented for finding exact soliton solutions for nonlinear second - order differential equations of  models with two interacting relativistic scalar fields in 1 + 1 dimensions , and it is model independent .",
    "the _ trial orbits method _ have been applied to the special cases whose soliton solutions of the nonlinear second - order differential equations are equivalent to the soliton solutions of first - order nonlinear coupled differential equations , the so - called bolgomolnyi - prasad - sommerfeld ( bps ) topological soliton solutions _ _  _ _ @xcite .",
    "some years ago one of us presented a method for finding additional soliton solutions for those special cases whose soliton solutions are the bps ones @xcite .",
    "latter , that approach was extended by considering more general models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , that method shows how to get the general equation of the orbits , explains how the different solutions connect the different vacua of the model under analysis and , as a novelty , presents a class of soliton solutions with a kink - like profile for both fields with its minimum energy ( bps energy ) smaller than that of the usual solution which exhibits a kink - like configuration for one of the fields and a lump - like configuration for the other one .",
    "moreover , the stability of the quantum states corresponding to these new soliton solutions can be shown on the same basis presented in @xcite .",
    "the bps soliton solutions have found applications in a great variety of natural systems whose dynamics can be approximately described by nonlinear quantum field models for interacting scalar fields in 1 + 1 dimensions bazeiareview . those kind of models have been generalized by including into the lagrangian density some minimal terms that break lorentz and cpt symmetries @xcite . by analyzing the consequences of additional soliton solutions in a given nonlinear model , some of us have shown lorentzbr , by using the method developed in @xcite , that those nonlinear lorentz breaking models in 1 + 1 dimensions exhibit additional soliton solutions whose bps energies are smaller than those found in barreto , and that more general lorentz breaking models in 1 + 1 dimensions , which admits soliton solutions , can be built .    in this work , we explore more deeply the classical solutions found in plb05 , particularly a class of degenerate soliton solutions shiffman , prd2008 , for the nonlinear model of two interacting scalar fields in 1 + 1 dimensions @xcite . in special ,",
    "we analyze the consequences that those additional soliton solutions bring for the scenario of accelerating universes .",
    "this scenario was recently conceived by brito and collaborators @xcite and it is within the context of the extra - dimensions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "our analysis is done by following a similar approach to that of the reference @xcite .",
    "it is shown that , for a critical value of the degeneracy parameter , the reflection coefficient of the bulk particles over the wall is maximized .",
    "that implies into a degree of expansion of the universe which is compatible with the present observed acceleration .    in the second section we present the model we are going to work with and discuss the influence of each set of soliton solutions , in the context of accelerating universes driven by the quantum states ( bulk particles ) . in the third section we present final comments about the impact of those new solutions over the expanding process",
    "a very important and intriguing modern physical problem is that of finding a way to explain the observed accelerated expansion of the universe . on the other hand ,",
    "the recent cosmological data indicates that a relevant part of the energy of the universe would be a kind of _ dark energy _ darkdata .",
    "in fact , that _ dark energy _ is supposed to be the responsible for that acceleration . as a consequence ,",
    "many authors look for a deep understanding of these subjects .",
    "a very interesting possibility is the one associated to the so - called brane worlds @xcite . in a recent work , brito and collaborators @xcite conceived a scenario where our universe is taken as a three - dimensional domain wall embedded in a five - dimensional minkowsky space - time , where the elastic collisions of bulk particles with the walls would be the ultimate reason for the universe acceleration .",
    "the model under analysis here is precisely the same one considered in the reference @xcite , which is the scalar sector of a five - dimensional supergravity theory obtained by means of dimensional compactification of a higher dimensional supergravity , where the lagrangian density @xcite looks like    @xmath0 + \\frac{1}{3\\ , m^3}w(\\phi ) ^2\\right\\ } , \\ ] ]    where @xmath1 is the five - dimensional planck length , @xmath2 is the ricci scalar , and @xmath3 is the metric on the scalar target space .",
    "now , considering the limiting situation where @xmath4 , so that the five - dimensional gravity decouples from the scalars , one is left with a 3-brane which is a classical @xmath5 domain wall embedded in a @xmath6 minkowski space @xcite .",
    "thus , in this limit , and choosing the case with two scalar fields in the target space , we are working with a nonlinear model with interacting scalar fields in 1 + 1 dimensions whose time - independent equations of motion ( eqs . ( [ 2ndorder ] ) below ) , are those one - dimensional static equations for the scalar fields taken into account in the reference @xcite .",
    "we follow the same route as in that reference , but here we consider more general set of static solutions and compare our results with those obtained in @xcite where the bulk particles , which are the quantum excitations around the classical solutions , collide with a 3d domain wall described by a kink .",
    "the essential idea is to show that the situation is richer than analyzed in @xcite , and that from a complete solution as the one we discuss here , important consequences for the expanding scenario show up .",
    "the model was introduced before to study bps soliton solutions @xcite and , recently , it was explored in the context of brane worlds @xcite .",
    "it consists of two interacting real scalar fields in 1 + 1 dimensions and it is described by the lagrangian density @xmath7where the potential is given by @xmath8the distinctive property of this model is that its potential can be written in terms of a so - called superpotential as @xmath9where the superpotential is@xmath10 .",
    "\\label{superpot}\\]]hence , finding the classical solutions with minimum energy for the time - independent equations of motion @xmath11is equivalent to find the classical solutions with minimum energy for the time - independent first - order differential equations @xmath12 in the above equations the prime means the derivative with respect to the space coordinate , and @xmath13 stands for the partial derivative of @xmath14 with respect to the @xmath15 field .",
    "the minimum energy ( bps energy ) @xcite for nonlinear systems described by the lagrangian density ( [ call ] ) with potentials written as ( potential2 ) is found to be given by @xmath16where @xmath17 and @xmath18 mean the @xmath19 vacuum states of the model .    applying the method developed in @xcite",
    ", we note that it is possible to write the relation @xmath20 , where the differential element @xmath21 is a kind of invariant .",
    "thus , one is lead to    @xmath22    this is in general a nonlinear differential equation relating the scalar fields of the model .",
    "if one is able to solve it completely for a given model , the function @xmath23 can be used to eliminate one of the fields , rendering the equations ( [ 1storder1 ] ) uncoupled and equivalent to a single one .",
    "finally , the resulting uncoupled first - order nonlinear equation can be solved in general , even if numerically . by substituting the derivatives of the superpotential ( [ superpot ] ) with respect to the fields in ( [ eqm ] ) ,",
    "it can be rewritten as a linear differential equation , @xmath24by the redefinition of the field , @xmath25 .",
    "now , the general solutions are easily obtained as @xmath26where @xmath27 is an arbitrary integration constant and , for the sake of simplicity , we will restrict our study to the case where @xmath28 .",
    "then , we substitute the above solutions in the differential equation ( [ 1storder1 ] ) and obtain the following first - order differential equation for the field @xmath29 , obtaining@xmath30    despite the fact that in general explicit solutions for the above equation can not be obtained , one can verify numerically that the solutions belong to the same classes , and some of those classes of solutions can be written in closed explicit forms . in those last cases we are able to obtain the several types of soliton solutions , whose consequences we discuss below .",
    "the set of solutions used by brito _",
    "et al _ @xcite , called here type - a kink @xcite to distinguish it from other types of kink solutions we present for this model , can be obtained by means of the method described in the previous section just by taking @xmath31 in the expression ( [ eqdchi1 ] ) . in this case",
    "that equation can be solved analytically for any value of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , in the range @xmath34 .",
    "we have the following solutions for @xmath29 and @xmath35:@xmath36 in this case the bps energy is given by @xmath37 .",
    "other soliton solutions can be found when one considers the integration constant @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "it was found in plb05,plb06,lorentzbr , prd2008 that in three particular cases the equation ( [ eqdchi1 ] ) can be solved analytically . for @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    "it was found that the solutions for the @xmath29 field are lump - like solutions , which vanishes when @xmath41 . on its turn ,",
    "the field @xmath42 exhibits a kink - like profile .",
    "they also connect the vacua of the model and also have bps energy @xmath43 .",
    "these classical solutions can be written as @xmath44    an interesting aspect of these solutions is that , for some values of @xmath45 , @xmath46 exhibits a double kink profile .",
    "we can speak of a formation of a double wall structure . in figure 1",
    "we plot some typical profiles of the soliton solutions in the case where @xmath47 , both when @xmath27 is close to its critical value ( @xmath48 in this case ) and far from it .",
    "both fields are there represented .",
    "one can verify that the distance from one wall to the other one increases as @xmath27 approaches its critical value .",
    "for the critical value of @xmath27 the double wall structure merges into a single one .",
    "similar behavior is also noted in the classical solutions for @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in this case",
    "the fields profile look like @xmath51and@xmath52 in the above solution one can also see the double kink profile for some values of @xmath27 , and the increasing of the distance from one wall to the another as @xmath27 approaches its critical value ( @xmath27 = 1/16 in this case ) . once again , at the critical value of @xmath27 , the double wall structure coalesces into a single wall . in figure 2",
    "it is shown the behavior of the energy density for @xmath53 . from that , it is quite evident the appearance of the double walls when one approaches @xmath54 .",
    "finally , very interesting analytical soliton solutions were shown to exist when one takes @xmath55 and the critical parameter @xmath56 and for @xmath53 and the critical parameter @xmath54 , in the equation ( [ eqdchi1 ] ) .",
    "the novelty in these cases is the fact that both , the @xmath29 field and the @xmath42 field present a kink - like profile and the bps energy is half of that of type - a kinks , that is @xmath57 .",
    "we call this set of solutions as type - b kinks . for @xmath55 and @xmath56 the classical solution for the fields",
    "can be shown to be given by @xmath58for @xmath54 and @xmath53 , the following set of type - b kinks is obtained @xmath59the type - b solutions also connect the vacua of the model , but this time one could interpret these solutions as two kinds of torsion in a chain , represented through an orthogonal set of coordinates @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in the plane ( @xmath60,@xmath61 ) , the type a kinks correspond to a complete torsion going from @xmath62 to @xmath63 whereas the type b corresponds to a half torsion , where the system goes from @xmath62 to @xmath64 , in the case where ( @xmath55 ) for instance .",
    "now , by proceeding as in @xcite , we perform a linear perturbation of the @xmath65 field around the classical solutions , that is @xmath66where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the classical solutions ( background fields ) and @xmath69 is the quantum field . by expanding the action up to quadratic terms in the quantum fields we obtain second - order differential equations for the quantum fields @xmath70that is",
    ", the quantum field obeys a klein - gordon equation with an effective potential @xmath71 which is obtained by taking the second derivative of the potential given in ( [ potential ] ) with respect to @xmath72 and evaluated at the classical solutions @xmath67 and @xmath73@xmath74    if we consider our model as a five - dimensional one and that the fluctuations can be expanded in terms of plane - waves in the space - time coordinates , that is @xmath75with @xmath76 a function of the fifth coordinate , we obtain the following schrdinger - like equation @xmath77where @xmath78 and we are considering that the static solutions described in the previous section are now functions of the coordinate @xmath79 .",
    "now , we compare the effect of all the above soliton solutions over the acceleration scenario proposed in @xcite . for this , we begin by considering the static solutions given by the equations ( [ chi2atil1 ] ) . by substituting them in the effective potential expressed in ( [ effpot ] ) , we find that the schrdinger - like equation for the quantum excitations is @xmath80    where @xmath81    and , when @xmath48 , the effective potential , for @xmath82 , becomes @xmath83    note that , in the case analyzed in @xcite , the effective potential is @xmath84    in figure 3 it is shown the behavior of the effective potential coming from the domain wall solutions in four situations : the case studied by brito et al . and for the case of degenerate solitons when @xmath27 is far from its critical value , near it and at the critical point ( @xmath48 ) . from that figure",
    "one can perceive that , apart from the appearance of the two wells potential , for @xmath27 close to the critical value , the case where the reflection coefficient is bigger is probably the case studied in @xcite .",
    "the more remarkable result comes to life for @xmath53 . by substituting the equations ( [ chi2atil2 ] ) and ( [ double2 ] ) in ( effpot )",
    ", one can verify that the quantum excitations of the @xmath65 field satisfies the effective schrdinger equation ( [ sch - eq ] ) with an effective potential given by @xmath85    and , when @xmath86 , the effective potential becomes @xmath87 .\\]]it can be observed from equation [ eff - pot - brito ] that , for @xmath88 , one has a constant effective potential @xmath89 , so there is no reflection of the bulk particles .",
    "this is an artifact of the particular solution considered in  @xcite .",
    "in contrast with this , the solutions presented here lead to effective potentials such that the reflection coefficient increases as @xmath27 approaches its critical value .",
    "those effective potentials are presented in figure 4 .",
    "one can note that , for @xmath27 far from and close to its critical value , there is a non - zero probability for the bulk particles to be transmitted , whereas , for the critical case , the effective potential acquires a ramp - like profile , so granting that the bulk particles with energy below the height of the ramp are certainly reflected by that infinitely large barrier .    for a given amount of energy available to build up structures in the original universe , we argue that it should be distributed , for instance , like    @xmath90    where @xmath91 stands for the number of defect structures of the @xmath92-th specimen and    @xmath93    with @xmath94 being the bps energy of a given soliton configuration , and @xmath95 the momentum of the excitation with mass @xmath96 hitting the wall .    in order to estimate the force acting on the wall by the incoming excitations , we consider quasi - elastic collisions to guarantee the energy conservation in the process .",
    "in other words , the kinetic energy acquired by the wall comes from the hitting particles . in that case",
    ", the momentum transferred to the wall is given by    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is the reflection coefficient and @xmath99 is the total number of incoming particles .",
    "from this , we can conclude that the acceleration of the wall is    @xmath100    with@xmath101 and @xmath102 is the flux of incident particles .    from now on",
    "we follow the brane inflation scenario presented in @xcite , and similarly in @xcite . in that scenario one",
    "supposes that we live in a three - dimensional domain wall which is considered as the surface of a hypersphere , whose radius increases due to the hitting bulk particles .",
    "the increasing of the radius can be modeled as @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the known scale factor and @xmath105 is the constant radius of the bubble in the comoving system .",
    "consequently , in this cosmological model , we have the metric of the 4d universe given by@xmath106from this point of view , the acceleration of the wall is proportional to the second - derivative in time of the scale factor , that is @xmath107 , and we have the following relation@xmath108where @xmath109 .",
    "it can be seen from figure 4 that the effective potential barrier width increases when the degeneracy parameter @xmath27 approaches its critical value @xmath110 . as a consequence ,",
    "the reflection coefficient becomes asymptotically constant .",
    "conversely , for @xmath27 far from the critical value the reflection coefficient tends to zero , since the width and height of the barrier diminish in this limiting situation .",
    "thus , when @xmath27 is close to the critical value , one has@xmath111which is compatible with the present observed behavior of the universe .",
    "furthermore , in the opposite limit , when @xmath112is far from the critical value , the reflection coefficient approaches zero . in this",
    "situation one can suppose that this happens exponentially , so the scale factor is given by@xmath113as requested by an inflationary era .    at this point it is important to remark that @xmath110 is a function of the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath32 .",
    "this can be noted from the fact that its value changes when the relation among @xmath32 and @xmath33 changes ( see the cases analyzed above ) .",
    "this property allows us to suppose that @xmath114 would have a time dependence , as well as the parameters of the potential .",
    "that dependence might have its origin in the universe expansion itself .",
    "the temperature of the universe decreases along with its expansion and , consequently , the parameters of the potential would exhibit a temperature dependence .",
    "therefore , @xmath110 approaches the value of @xmath115 the universe was created with .",
    "in this work we have analyzed the impact of a general set of soliton solutions over the reflection coefficient of the bulk particle collisions with a 3d domain wall , as originally proposed in @xcite .",
    "we have shown that when the potential parameters are such that @xmath53 , the effective potential interacting with the bulk particles have its reflection coefficient arbitrarily larger , depending on the value of the degeneracy parameter @xmath27 .",
    "a remarkable situation is that when @xmath27 reaches its critical value . in that case",
    ", the effective potential becomes a kind of step potential , so that the bulk particles having energy lesser than that of the step potential will always be reflected , so producing a quadratic driven acceleration .",
    "the degenerate structure , however , in principle would be created with an arbitrary @xmath27 , far from the original critical value of the universe , so leading to an exponentially growing driven acceleration . therefore , while the universe is cooling due to its expansion , the critical value @xmath116 approaches @xmath27 and , as a consequence , the reflection coefficient increases and the acceleration also becomes quadratic .",
    "thus , supposing that both types of topological structures were created in the origin of the universe , one can see that the degenerate structure would dominate the beginning of the process .",
    "this happens due to the fact that , when the reflection coefficient is close to one , the scale factor @xmath117 and for an exponentially growing reflection coefficient , it grows exponentially too .",
    "therefore , in the beginning the degenerate structure dominates the expansion and , as the time goes by , both structures predict a quadratic behavior , which is compatible with the present experimental bounds .",
