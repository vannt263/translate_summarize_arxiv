    "nasa s _ swift _  mission @xcite has enabled fundamental insights into the physics of gamma - ray bursts thanks to two new capabilities : first , the greater sensitivity of its burst alert detector @xcite ( bat ; energy range 20150 kev ) in comparison to the preceding _ beppo - sax _  and _ hete-2 _  missions @xcite ; and second , its ability to slew in less than 100 seconds to the burst direction determined by the bat , which allows it to position its much higher - angular resolution  ( xrt , few - arcsec ) and uv - optical ( uvot , sub - arcsec ) detectors @xcite for observations of the prompt and early afterglow emission .    as of july  2006 , over 150 bursts had been detected by bat , at an average rate of 2 bursts detected per week .",
    "of these , roughly 90% were followed promptly with the xrt within @xmath1 s from the trigger , and about half within 100  s @xcite , while @xmath2 were detected with the uvot @xcite .",
    "this resulted in over 30 new redshift determinations .",
    "eleven definitive short grbs were detected , of which seven had detected  afterglows ( including three with optical afterglows , and two with radio ) , and five had proposed redshifts .",
    "these _ swift _  observations , complemented by the continuing operations of the _ hete-2 _  and _ integral",
    "_  missions , have brought the total number of redshift determinations to over 60 since _ beppo - sax _  enabled the first one in 1997 .",
    "the redshifts based on _ swift _  have a median @xmath3 @xcite , which is a factor @xmath4 higher than the median of those previously culled via _ beppo - sax _  and _ hete-2_@xcite .",
    "this can be credited largely to the prompt @xmath5arcsec positions from xrt and uvot , which make rapid ground - based observations possible at a stage when the afterglow is still bright .",
    "the highest _",
    "swift_-enabled redshift so far was that of grb050904 , from 8-meter class subaru spectroscopy , @xmath6 @xcite ( the pre-_swift _",
    "record was @xmath7 for the ipn - localized grb000131 @xcite ) .",
    "the relative paucity of uvot detections versus xrt detections may be ascribed in part to this higher median redshift ( and correspondingly reduced median flux ) , and in part to the ( expected ) increased dust extinction at the shorter rest - frame wavelengths implied for any given observing band @xcite , although the issue is still the subject of debate .",
    "_ bat light curves : _ the bat is provided with an array of triggering algorithms which provide greater sensitivity than those of previous spacecraft , including `` imaging '' triggers which , through analysis of the counts integrated over 128-s to 512-s timescales , enable the detection of faint , slow - rising events . in a peculiar irony of grb studies ,",
    "these image triggers have made possible the discovery of both the farthest , highly time - dilated burst grb050904 , and the nearest , faint and slow - rising burst grb060218 ( see below for further discussion ) .",
    "for some of the bursts which fall in the `` long '' category ( @xmath8-ray duration @xmath9 s ) , the bat has detected faint soft gamma - ray tails which extend the duration by a factor up to two beyond what the previous burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) could have detected @xcite .",
    "such extended soft tails have been found also in some `` short '' bursts , normally defined as having a hard spectrum and duration @xmath10 s ( see below ) .",
    "_ xrt light curves : _ striking new insights into burst and afterglow physics have come from the detailed  light curves , starting on average 100 seconds after the @xmath8-ray trigger , that result from the prompt xrt observations of bat - detected bursts .",
    "these observations suggest a canonical  afterglow ( fig .  [",
    "fig : xrt - lc ] ; @xcite ) with one or more of the following stages ( note that the numerical subscript enumerates each stage ) : ( 1 ) an initial steep decay @xmath11 with temporal index @xmath12 , and an energy spectrum @xmath13 with energy spectral index @xmath14 ( photon index @xmath15 ) , extending up to a time @xmath16 ; ( 2 ) a subsequent flatter decay @xmath17 with @xmath18 and energy index @xmath19 , at times @xmath20 ( in some cases interspersed with flares , see @xcite ; ( 3 ) a `` normal '' decay @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( generally unchanged from the previous stage , i.e.  @xmath24 ) , up to a time @xmath25 , or in some cases longer ; ( 4 ) in some cases , a steeper  decay at the end , @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , after @xmath28 , resembling what is expected from jet breaks ; ( 5 ) in about half the afterglows , one or more  flares or bumps are observed in the light curve , sometimes starting as early as 100 s after trigger , and sometimes as late as @xmath29 .",
    "the energy in these flares ranges from a percent up to a value comparable to the prompt emission ( in grb050502b ) .",
    "the rise and decay times of these flares is unusually steep , depending on the reference time @xmath30 , behaving as @xmath31 with @xmath32 , and energy indices which can be also steeper than during the smooth decay portions .",
    "the flux level after the flare usually decays to the value extrapolated from the value before the flare rise .",
    "= 5.in    _ very high - redshift bursts : _ another major advance achieved by _ swift _",
    "was the detection of the long burst grb050904 , which broke the @xmath33 redshift barrier .",
    "this burst was very bright , both in its prompt @xmath8-ray emission ( @xmath34 erg ) and in its  afterglow .",
    "prompt ground - based optical / ir upper limits and a @xmath35-band detection suggested a photometric redshift @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic confirmation with the 8.2 m subaru telescope gave @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "there are several striking features to this burst .",
    "one is its enormous  brightness , exceeding for a full day the  brightness of the most distant quasar known to - date , sdss  j0130 + 0524  and exceeding it by a factor of @xmath36 in the first minutes @xcite .",
    "the implications for the use of grbs as a tool for probing the igm are thought - provoking .",
    "another notable feature was its extremely variable  light curve , showing many large amplitude flares throughout the first day ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc050904 ] ) .",
    "a third exciting feature is its brief , very bright ir flash @xcite , comparable in brightness to the famous @xmath37 optical flash in grb990123 .",
    "= 5.in    _ short bursts : _ the third major advance from _ swift _  was the discovery and localization of short grb afterglows .",
    "as of july  2006 , eleven definitive short bursts have been localized by _ swift _ , and _ hete-2 _  has discovered two short bursts with subsequent afterglow emission ; in addition , the short burst grb051103 was localized by the ipn to a region intersecting the nearby galaxies m81 and m82 . in seven of",
    "the _ swift _  short bursts and two _ hete-2 _  bursts an  afterglow was detected and observed , with grbs 050709 , 050724 , 051221a , 060313 , and 060121 ( as well as the candidate short burst grb051227 ) also showing optical afterglows , and grbs 050724 and 051221a being detected in the radio @xcite .",
    "these are the first afterglows detected for short bursts , and yielded the first host galaxy identifications .",
    "the hosts are of early type ( ellipticals ) in roughly half the cases , and otherwise appear to be dwarf irregular galaxies  albeit with evidence for old as well as young stellar populations @xcite .",
    "the redshifts of five of them are in the range 0.15 to 0.5 , while grb050813 was initially thought to have @xmath38 @xcite but may be associated with a galaxy cluster at @xmath39 @xcite , and the redshift of the _ hete-2 _",
    "grb060121 is estimated to be @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the median @xmath41 ( as yet unaffected by these two relatively high redshifts ) is @xmath42 , which gives a @xmath43 that is 1/3 that of the long bursts .",
    "while there is evidence for star formation in roughly half the host galaxies , overall the host properties correspond to expectations for a progenitor population of neutron star or neutron star - black hole binary systems , the most often - discussed progenitor candidates .",
    "such hosts would also be compatible with other progenitors involving old compact stars .",
    "the first short burst afterglow seen by _ swift _  was that of grb050509b , a low luminosity ( @xmath44 erg ) burst with a simple power - law  afterglow which could only be followed for @xmath45 s @xcite .",
    "the subsequent afterglows of grb050724 ( @xmath46 erg ; @xcite ) and grb051221a ( @xmath47 erg ; @xcite ) were brighter , and could be followed in for at least @xmath36 s @xcite . in particular , the  afterglow of grb050724 is remarkable in that it exhibits a typical  light curve as observed from long grbs by _ swift _  ( apart from the absence of a slow - decay phase ) .",
    "it shows a fast early decay , with significant  flares , one at 100  s and another at @xmath48  s. the first flare has the same fluence as the prompt emission , while the late flare has roughly 10% of that .",
    "the interpretation of this activity poses interesting challenges , as discussed below .",
    "_ the grb - sn connection : _ the fourth major advance from _ swift _  was its observation , with bat , xrt and uvot , of an unusually long ( @xmath49 s ) , soft burst , grb060218 @xcite , soon found to be associated with sn2006aj , a nearby ( @xmath50 ) type ic supernova @xcite .",
    "the optical light curve of this supernova peaked earlier than for most other known supernovae , and the time of core collapse is constrained to within a day of the grb trigger .",
    "this was the first time that a connected grb and supernova event was observed starting in the first @xmath5100  s in  and uv / optical light , and the results are of great interest .",
    "the early  light curve shows a slow rise and plateau followed by a drop after @xmath51 s ; the spectrum is initially dominated by a power - law component , with an increasing thermal component that dominates after @xmath523000  s. perhaps the most interesting interpretation involves shock break - out of a semi - relativistic component in a wr progenitor wind @xcite , although see also @xcite .",
    "after this a more conventional  power - law decay follows , and a uv component peaking at a later time can be interpreted as due to the slower supernova envelope shock . finally , a radio - bright component is seen that presents an interesting comparison to other local and grb - related type ic supernovae @xcite . a distinct grb / sn detection based on _ swift _  afterglow observations is that associated with grb050525a @xcite .    _",
    "prompt optical observations : _ a final major advance enabled by _",
    "swift _  has been a wealth of information about the prompt and early - time optical emission of grbs .",
    "thanks to _ swift _  alerts and an array of ground - based robotic telescopes ( as well as the uvot ) , the detection of optical counterparts during and shortly after ( @xmath53100  s ) the gamma - ray trigger is becoming almost routine .",
    "the _ swift _  era began with the detection in optical @xcite and near - infrared @xcite wavelengths of a bright flash associated with grb041219a ( localized in real time by _ integral _ ) . apart from exhibiting the first optical flash with brightness ( after correcting for galactic extinction ) similar to grb990123 , this burst showed the first evidence for correlated low- and high - energy emission , intepreted as optical emission from the same internal shocks that produced the grb @xcite .",
    "a similar level of correlated optical emission was later observed from grb050820a @xcite ; however in this case it was accompanied by an uncorrelated component that connected smoothly to the later afterglow .",
    "prompt optical emission that extrapolates smoothly to the later afterglow seems to be the more usual case ; however , bright flares consistent with a reverse - shock interpretation are seen on occasion @xcite .",
    "the most exciting single observation is probably the @xmath54mag optical flash from grb050904 at @xmath55 observed with tarot @xcite , which rises to its peak after the end of gamma - ray emission and is brighter , and decays more quickly than , the later afterglow  all properties consistent with an origin in this burst s reverse shock .",
    "the prompt gamma - ray emission of a classical grb has most of its energy in the energy range 0.1 to 2.0  mev .",
    "the generic photon spectrum is a broken power law @xcite with a break energy in the above range , and , typically , power law extensions down into the x - ray , and up into the 100 mev to gev ranges ( although a number of bursts show a thermal - like spectrum , which sometimes can be fitted with a blackbody @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest model for the gamma - ray emission assumes that a proton crossing a strong shock front with a relative bulk lorentz factor @xmath56 acquires ( in the comoving frame ) an internal energy characterized by a random ( comoving ) lorentz factor @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the comoving magnetic field behind the shock can build up due to turbulent dynamo effects behind the shocks @xcite ( as also inferred in supernova remnant shocks ) .",
    "more recently , the weibel instability has been studied in this context @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of this process remains under debate , but one can parametrize the magnetic field as having a post - shock energy density which is a fraction @xmath58 of the equipartition value relative to the proton random energy , @xmath59^{1/2 } \\gamma$ ] , where the post - shock proton comoving internal energy is @xmath60 ( or @xmath61 ) for internal ( external ) shocks @xcite . scattering of electrons ( and protons ) by magnetic irregularities upstream and downstream can lead to a fermi acceleration process resulting in a relativistic power law distribution of energies @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "the starting minimum ( comoving ) lorentz factor of the thermal electrons injected into the acceleration process , @xmath64 would in principle be the same as for the protons , @xmath65 ( they experience the same velocity difference ) , hence both before and after acceleration they would have @xmath66 less energy than the protons .",
    "however , the shocks are collisionless , i.e.  mediated by chaotic electric and magnetic fields , and can redistribute the proton energy between the electrons and protons , up to some fraction @xmath67 of the thermal energy equipartition value with the protons , so @xmath68 @xcite . the synchrotron spectrum , in its simplest form , peaks at @xmath69 , and has a shape @xmath70 $ ] for [ @xmath71 ;   @xmath72 , in the adiabatic limit where the cooling time is longer than the dynamic time . in the opposite ( radiative ) limit , the spectrum peaks at the cooling frequency @xmath73 ( at which cooling time for electrons emitting at @xmath73 equals dynamic time , and the spectrum above is @xmath74 .",
    "depending on the parameters , more complicated spectra are possible , discussed e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum is modified at low energies by self - absorption @xcite , making the spectrum steeper ; and it is also modified at high energies , due to inverse compton effects @xcite , extending into the gev range .",
    "however , a number of effects can modify the simple synchrotron spectrum . for instance , the distribution of observed low energy spectral indices @xmath75 ( where @xmath76 below the spectral peak ) has a mean value @xmath77 , but for a fraction of bursts this slope reaches positive values @xmath78 which are incompatible with a simple synchrotron interpretation @xcite .",
    "possible explanations include synchrotron self - absorption in the  @xcite or in the optical range up - scattered to x - rays @xcite , low - pitch angle scattering or jitter radiation @xcite , observational selection biases @xcite and/or time - dependent acceleration and radiation @xcite , where low - pitch angle diffusion can also explain high energy indices steeper than predicted by isotropic scattering .",
    "other models invoke a photospheric component and pair formation @xcite .",
    "pair formation can become important in internal shocks or dissipation regions occurring at small radii , since a high comoving luminosity implies a large comoving compactness parameter .",
    "a moderate to high scattering depth can lead to a compton equilibrium which gives spectral peaks in the right energy range @xcite .",
    "an important aspect is that compton equilibrium of internal shock electrons or pairs with photospheric photons leads to a high radiative efficiency , as well as to spectra with a break at the right preferred energy and steep low energy slopes @xcite",
    ". it also leads to possible physical explanations for the amati @xcite or ghirlanda @xcite relations between spectral peak energy and burst fluence @xcite .",
    "prompt optical flashes , defined as optical emission detected while gamma - ray emission is still in progress and exemplified by the original detection from grb990123 @xcite , have been generally interpreted @xcite as radiation from the reverse component of the external shock . however ,",
    "a prompt optical flash can be produced from either an internal shock or the reverse external shock , or both @xcite .",
    "the decay rate of the optical flux from reverse shocks is very fast ( and that of internal shocks , faster yet ) compared to the decay of forward shock emission , so that the forward shock component typically dominates within minutes to tens of minutes .",
    "observations prior to the _ swift _  era demonstrated already that bright flashes such as that seen from grb990123 were relatively rare . at the same time , the slow - fading ( @xmath79 ) optical emission from grb021004 and the relatively faint optical flash from grb021211 were both argued to have properties consistent with a reverse shock origin @xcite .",
    "optical / uv afterglows are now detected at early times , @xmath53100  s , in prompt observations with the _ swift _  uvot telescope in roughly half the bursts for which an  afterglow was seen ; for a detailed discussion see @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the ongoing discussion of whether the `` dark grbs '' which remain undetected by the uvot are really optically deficient , or remain unobserved due to observational biases ( e.g. , the relatively blue bandpass of uvot and the high redshifts of the _ swift _  sample ; @xcite ) .    the fastest routine responses to _ swift _  alerts are being realized by robotic ground - based telescopes , a large number of which have been brought on - line in recent years .",
    "the first substantial discovery yielded by these observatories has been of the gamma - ray correlated component of the prompt optical emission @xcite .",
    "this component is not observed in every burst , but the mere fact of this correlation is sufficient to establish its likely origin in the burst s internal shocks @xcite . when observed , the ratio of the correlated gamma - ray to optical flux densities has been found to be roughly @xmath36 to one .",
    "in contrast to bursts with reverse - shock flare or gamma - ray correlated emission , the typical burst is now revealed to either exhibit a single power - law decay from early times @xcite , or to exhibit a flat or rising light curve @xcite before it enters the standard power - law afterglow decay .",
    "the initial brightness of the typical counterpart is @xmath80 to 17  mag , which has made observations challenging for the usual @xmath531  m telescopes employed .",
    "there are a number of possible reasons for the observed faintness of early optical emission from typical grbs .",
    "suppression of internal shock emission can be provided by self - absorption in the optical , coupled to the lower flux implied by the @xmath81 low - energy asymptote of the synchrotron spectrum peaking at @xmath5 mev @xcite .",
    "suppression of reverse shock emission , on the other hand , may indicate the absence or weakness of the reverse shock , e.g.if the ejecta are highly magnetized @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the deceleration might occur in the thick - shell regime ( @xmath82 ) , resulting in the reverse shock being relativistic and boosting the optical spectrum into the uv @xcite ( but a detection by uvot might then be expected , unless the decay is faster than the typical 100 to 200  s uvot response time ) .",
    "another possibility , for a high comoving luminosity , is copious pair formation in the ejecta , causing the reverse shock spectrum to peak in the ir @xcite . both grbs 990123 and 050904 ( see below ) have a relatively large @xmath34erg , so the latter seems a promising option . even without pairs , more accurate calculations of the reverse shock @xcite find the emission to be significantly weaker than what was estimated earlier .",
    "yet another possibility is that the cooling frequency in reverse shock is not much larger than the optical band frequency . in this case",
    "the optical emission from the reverse shock drops to zero very rapidly soon after the reverse shock has crossed the ejecta and the cooling frequency drops below the optical and there are no electrons left to radiate in the optical band @xcite .",
    "that said , a few persuasive observations of reverse - shock optical emission have been made in the _ swift _  era , so it can finally be said that grb990123 does not stand alone .",
    "the early optical / ir emission from grb041219 would have rivalled that seen from grb990123 if not for the large galactic extinction along the line of sight @xcite , and of the three distinct peaks observed by pairitel , the second may represent a reverse shock contribution @xcite  if so , a relatively small lorentz factor , @xmath83 , is implied .",
    "observations of grb050525a with uvot @xcite and grb060111b with tarot ( in a unique time - resolved tracking mode ; @xcite ) show the `` flattening '' light - curve familiar from grb021211 ( as well as , probably , grb990123 ) that is termed the `` type ii '' light curve by @xcite .",
    "evolution of the optical flux in this manner is supposed to indicate the presence of magnetized ejecta or a poynting - flux dominated outflow .",
    "an alternate case may be provided by grb060117 , observed by the fram sky monitor telescope of the pierre auger observatory @xcite .",
    "this burst is the largest - fluence grb observed by _",
    "swift _  to - date , and its optical flash was also very bright , peaking at @xmath84mag and thus rivalling grb990123 .",
    "although their quality is not high , the data suggest that the forward shock peak is distinguished above the decay of the reverse shock flux , providing a potential first example of the `` type i '' two - peaked lightcurve that is predicted for a hydrodynamic ( nonmagnetized ) outflow @xcite",
    ".    finally , the most exciting prompt robotic ir detection ( and optical non - detection ) is that of grb050904 @xcite , which is also though to be due to a reverse shock @xcite ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "this object , at the unprecedented `` very high '' redshift of @xmath6 @xcite , had an  brightness exceeding for a day that of the brightest  quasars @xcite , and its optical / ir brightness in the first 500  s ( observer time ) was comparable to that of grb990123 , with a similarly steep time - decay slope @xmath85 .",
    "the afterglow generally becomes important after a time t_ag= max [ ( r_dec/2c ^2)(1+z )  ,  t ] = max [ 10 ^ 2 ( e_52/n_0)^1/3 _ 2 ^ -8/3(1+z)|s  ,  t ]  , [ eq : tag ] where the deceleration time is @xmath86 and @xmath87 is the duration of the prompt outflow ; @xmath88 then marks the beginning of the self - similar blast - wave regime where @xmath89 ( in the adiabatic regime ; @xmath90 in the radiative regime ) .    denoting the frequency and time dependence of the afterglow spectral energy flux as @xmath91 ,",
    "the late  afterglow phases ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) described above are similar to those known previously from _ beppo - sax _  ( for a review of this earlier behavior and its modeling see e.g.  @xcite ) . the `` normal '' decay phase ( 3 ) , with temporal decay indices @xmath92 and spectral energy indices @xmath93 , is what is expected from the evolution of the forward shock in the blandford - mckee self - similar late time regime , under the assumption of synchrotron emission .    the late steep decay phase ( 4 ) of  [ sec : obs ] , occasionally seen in _ swift _  bursts , is naturally explained as a jet break , when the decrease of the ejecta lorentz factor leads to the light - cone angle becoming larger than the jet angular extent , @xmath94 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it is noteworthy , however , that this final steepening has been seen in less than @xmath95 of the _ swift_afterglows , and even then for the most part only in x - rays .",
    "the corresponding optical light curve breaks have been few , and not well - constrained .",
    "this is unlike the case with the @xmath96 _ beppo - sax _",
    "bursts , for which many achromatic breaks were reported in the optical @xcite , while in some of the rare cases where an  or radio break was reported it occurred at a different time @xcite .",
    "the relative paucity of optical breaks in _",
    "swift_afterglows may be an observational selection effect due to the larger median redshift , and hence fainter and redder optical afterglows at the same observer epoch , as well as perhaps reluctance to commit large telescope time on the more frequently - reported _ swift _",
    "bursts ( an average , roughly , of two per month with _ beppo - sax _  versus two per week with _ swift _ ) .      among the new early afterglow features detected by _",
    "swift _ , the steep initial decay phase @xmath97 in x - rays of the long grb afterglows is one of the most puzzling .",
    "there could be several possible reasons for this .",
    "the most immediate of these would be the cooling following cessation of the prompt emission ( internal shocks or dissipation ) .",
    "if the comoving magnetic field in the emission region is random [ or transverse ] , the flux per unit frequency along the line of sight in a given energy band , as a function of the electron energy index @xmath98 , decays as @xmath99 with @xmath100 $ ] in the slow cooling regime , where @xmath101 , and it decays as @xmath102 $ ] in the fast cooling regime where @xmath103 , i.e.  for the standard @xmath104 this would be @xmath105 $ ] in the slow cooling or @xmath106 $ ] in the fast cooling regime , for random [ transverse ] fields @xcite . in some bursts this may be the explanation , but in others the time and spectral indices do not correspond well .",
    "currently the most widely considered explanation for the fast decay , either in the initial phase ( 1 ) or in the steep flares , attributes it to off - axis emission from regions at @xmath107 ( also termed curvature effects or high - latitude emission @xcite ) . in this case , after line - of - sight gamma - ray emission has ceased , the off - axis emission observed from @xmath108 is @xmath109 smaller than that from the line of sight . integrating over the equal arrival time region ,",
    "this flux ratio becomes @xmath110 .",
    "since the emission from @xmath111 arrives @xmath112 later than from @xmath113 , the observer sees the flux falling as @xmath114 , if the flux were frequency independent . for a source - frame flux @xmath115 ,",
    "the observed flux per unit frequency varies then as f_(t - t_0)^-2- [ eq : hilat ] i.e.  @xmath116 . this high - latitude radiation , which for observers outside the line cone at @xmath117 would appear as prompt @xmath8-ray emission from dissipation at radius @xmath118 , appears to observers along the line of sight ( inside the light cone ) to arrive delayed by @xmath119 relative to the trigger time , and its spectrum",
    "is softened by a doppler factor @xmath120 into the  observer band . for the initial prompt decay ,",
    "the onset of the afterglow ( e.g.  phases 2 or 3 ) , which also comes from the line of sight , may overlap in time with the delayed high - latitude emission . in equation ( [ eq : hilat ] )",
    "@xmath30 can be taken as the trigger time , or some value comparable or less than by equation ( [ eq : tag ] ) .",
    "this can be used to constrain the prompt emission radius @xcite .",
    "when @xmath121 , the emission can have an admixture of high - latitude and afterglow contributions , and since the afterglow has a steeper spectrum than the high - latitude emission ( which has a prompt spectrum ) , one can have steeper decays @xcite .",
    "values of @xmath30 closer to the onset of the decay also lead to steeper slopes .",
    "structured jets , when viewed on - beam , produce essentially the same slopes as homogeneous jets , while off - beam observing can lead to shallower slopes @xcite . for the flares ,",
    "if their origin is assumed to be internal ( e.g.  some form of late internal shock or dissipation ) the value of @xmath30 is just before the flare , near the observed time of flare onset @xcite .",
    "this interpretation appears , so far , compatible with most of the _ swift_afterglows @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the initial fast decay could be due to the emission of a cocoon of exhaust gas @xcite , where the temporal and spectral index are explained through an approximately power - law behavior of escape times and spectral modification of multiply - scattered photons .",
    "the fast decay may also be due to the reverse shock emission , if inverse compton interactions up - scatter the ( primarily synchrotron ) optical photons into the  range .",
    "the decay starts after the reverse shock has crossed the ejecta and electrons are no longer accelerated , and may have both line - of - sight and off - axis components @xcite .",
    "this poses strong constraints on the compton @xmath122 parameter , and can not explain steeper decays with @xmath123 , or @xmath124 if the off - axis contribution dominates .",
    "models involving bullets  whose origin , acceleration and survivability is unexplained",
    " could give a prompt decay index @xmath125 to 5 @xcite , but imply a bremsstrahlung energy index @xmath126 which is not observed in the fast decay , and require fine - tuning .",
    "finally , a `` patchy shell '' model , where the lorentz factor is highly variable in angle , would produce emission with @xmath127 .",
    "thus , such mechanisms may explain the more gradual decays , but not the more extreme @xmath128 to 7 values encountered in some cases .",
    "the slow decay portion of the  light curves ( @xmath129 to 0.7 ) , quite ubiquitously detected by _ swift _",
    ", is not entirely new , having been detected in a few cases by _ beppo - sax_. this , as well as the appearance of wiggles and flares in the  light curves several hours after the burst , were the motivation for the `` refreshed shocks '' scenario @xcite .",
    "refreshed shocks can flatten the afterglow light curve for hours or days , even if the ejecta is all emitted promptly at @xmath130 , but with a range of lorentz factors , say @xmath131 , where the lower @xmath65 shells arrive much later to the foremost fast shells which have already been decelerated .",
    "thus , for an external medium of density @xmath132 and a prompt injection where the lorentz factor spread relative to ejecta mass and energy is @xmath133 , @xmath134 , the forward shock flux temporal decay is given by @xcite = [ ( g-4)(1+s)+(24 -7g+sg)]/[2(7+s-2 g ) ]  .",
    "[ eq : shallow ] it needs to be emphasized that in this model all the ejection can be prompt ( e.g.  over the duration @xmath135 of the gamma ray emission ) but the low @xmath65 portions arrive at ( and refresh ) the forward shock at late times , which can range from hours to days .",
    "that is , it is not the central engine which is active late ; rather , its effects are seen late .",
    "fitting such refreshed - shock models to the shallow decay phases in _ swift _  bursts @xcite leads to a @xmath65 distribution which is a broken power law , extending above and below a peak around @xmath136 .",
    "an alternate version of refreshed shocks does envisage central engine activity extending for long periods of time , e.g.  @xmath137 day ( in contrast to the @xmath137 minutes engine activity in the model above ) .",
    "such long - lived activity may be due to continued fall - back into the central black hole @xcite or to a magnetar wind @xcite .",
    "one characteristic of both types of refreshed models is that after the refreshed shocks stop and the usual decay resumes , the flux level shows a step - up relative to the previous level , since new energy has been injected .    from current analyses ,",
    "the refreshed shock model is generally able to explain the flatter temporal  slopes seen by _ swift _ , both when it is seen to join smoothly on the prompt emission ( i.e.  without an initial steep decay phase ) or when seen after an initial steep decay .",
    "questions remain concerning the interpretation of the fluence ratio in the shallow  afterglow and the prompt gamma - ray emission , which can reach @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "this requires a higher radiative efficiency in the prompt gamma - ray emission than in the  afterglow .",
    "one could speculate that this might be achieved if the prompt outflow were poynting - dominated .",
    "alternatively , a highly - efficient afterglow might emit a large fraction of its energy in other ( unobserved ) bands , e.g.in the gev or ir . or @xcite a previous mass ejection might have emptied a cavity into which the ejecta moves , leading to greater efficiency at later times , or otherwise causing the energy fraction going into electrons to increase @xmath139 .",
    "refreshed shocks can also explain some of the  flares whose rise and decay slopes are not too steep .",
    "however , this model encounters difficulties with the very steep flares with rise or decay indices @xmath140 , such as inferred from the giant flare of grb050502b @xcite around 300s after the trigger . also , the flux level increase in this flare is a factor @xmath141 above the smooth afterglow before and after it , implying a comparable energy excess in the low- versus high-@xmath65 material .",
    "an explanation based on inverse compton scattering in the reverse shock @xcite can explain a single flare at the beginning of the afterglow , as long as the subsequent flux decay is not too steep . for multiple flares ,",
    "models invoking blastwave interaction with a lumpy external medium have generic difficulties explaining steep rises and decays @xcite , although extremely dense , sharp - edged lumps , if they exist , might satisfy the steepness criterion @xcite .",
    "currently the more widely - considered model for the flares ascribes them to late central engine activity @xcite .",
    "the strongest arguments in favor of this are that the energy budget is more easily satisfied , and the fast rises and decays more straightforward to explain .",
    "in such a model the flare energy can be comparable to the prompt emission , and the fast rise comes naturally from the short time variability leading to internal shocks ( or to rapid reconnection ) , while the rapid decay may be explained as the high - latitude emission following the flare , with @xmath30 reset to the beginning of each flare ( see discussion in @xcite ) . considering the full population of  flares ,",
    "some are well - modeled by refreshed forward shocks , while in others this is clearly ruled out and a central engine origin is better suited @xcite .",
    "aside from the phenomenological desirability based on energetics and timescales , a central engine origin is conceivable , within certain time ranges , based on numerical models of the core collapse scenario for long bursts .",
    "these invoke the core collapse of a massive stellar progenitor , where continued infall into the fast - rotating core can continue for a long time @xcite .",
    "however , large flares with a fluence which is a sizable fraction of the prompt emission occurring hours later remain difficult to understand .",
    "it has been argued that gravitational instabilities in the infalling debris torus can lead to lumpy accretion @xcite .",
    "alternatively , if the accreting debris torus is dominated by magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) effects , magnetic instabilities can lead to extended , highly time - variable accretion @xcite .      _",
    "swift _  and to a lesser extent _ hete-2 _  have provided the first bonafide short burst afterglows , with the first observations beginning ( in some cases ) within @xmath53100  s of the trigger , leading in turn to arcsec and sub - arcsec localizations , host galaxy identifications , and redshifts ( although , as yet , none via direct absorption spectroscopy ) .    in the first short burst afterglow , grb050509b @xcite , the extrapolation of the prompt bat emission into the  range , along with the xrt light curve from 100 to 1000  s , can be fitted with a single power law of @xmath142 .",
    "the  coverage was sparse due to orbital constraints and the faintness of the afterglow , and the number of detected  photons was small .",
    "no optical transient was detected , but an elliptical host galaxy was identified at @xmath143 ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in grb050709 an optical transient was identified , as well as a host galaxy @xcite , an irregular galaxy at @xmath144 ( observations also ruled out any supernova association ) .",
    "grb050724 was relatively bright , and in addition to an afterglow observed with the xrt and _ chandra _",
    "@xcite , yielded decaying optical and radio afterglows @xcite .",
    "this burst , as with roughly half the short burst afterglows seen to - date , is associated with an elliptical host galaxy .",
    "it also had a low - luminosity , soft gamma - ray extension of the short - hard gamma - ray component ( which would have been missed by batse ) , and it had an interesting  afterglow extending beyond @xmath36  s , with no jet break seen to the limits of the final _ chandra _  observation @xcite .",
    "the soft gamma - ray extension , lasting up to 200  s , connects smoothly with the beginning of the xrt afterglow , which has @xmath145 between 100 and 300  s , and then enters a much steeper decay with @xmath146 to 7 out to @xmath147 , followed by a more moderate decay @xmath148 .",
    "an unexpected feature is a strong flare peaking at @xmath149  s , with an energy 10% that of the prompt emission , and an amplitude which represents a 10-fold increase over the preceding slow decay .",
    "grb051221a , the next panchromatic short burst afterglow , has an extended light curve in the  @xcite and optical @xcite .",
    "this was the brightest short burst observed by _",
    "swift_to date , and occurred in a star - forming galaxy at redshift @xmath150 .",
    "the  light curve also provides the clearest evidence of `` standard '' energy injection , with a flattening from 1.4 to 3.4 hours after the burst which increases the afterglow energy by a factor of @xmath53 , and is moreover reflected in contemporaneous radio detections from the vla .    with seven afterglows and five relatively secure redshifts in hand via host galaxy identifications , the distribution of short bursts in redshift and among host galaxy types  including an equal number of spiral / irregular and elliptical hosts  is typical of an old ( @xmath151gyr ) population of progenitors , such as neutron star ( ns ) binaries or black hole - neutron star binaries @xcite .",
    "the main challenges posed by the short burst afterglows are the relatively long , soft tail of the prompt emission , and the strength and late occurrence of the flares . a possible explanation for the extended long soft tails ( @xmath5100  s ) may be that the compact binary progenitor is a black hole - neutron star system @xcite , since analytical and numerical arguments ( @xcite , and references therein ) suggest that disruption of the ns and its disappearance into the black hole may lead to a complex and extended accretion phase significantly longer than for double neutron stars . the flares , for which the simplest interpretation might be as refreshed shocks ( compatible with a short engine duration @xmath152 s , for ejecta with an extended lorentz factor distribution ) , require the energy in the slow material to be at least ten times more energetic than the fast material responsible for the prompt emission in the specific case of the grb050724 flare at @xmath153 s. the rise and decay times are moderate enough for this interpretation .",
    "another interpretation invokes the accretion - induced collapse of a neutron star in a binary , leading to a flare when the fireball created by the collapse hits the companion @xcite , which might explain moderate energy one - time flares .",
    "however , for repeated , energetic flares , as also seen from long bursts , the total energetics are easier to satisfy if one postulates late central engine activity ( lasting at least half a day ) , containing @xmath95 of the prompt fluence @xcite . a possible way to produce",
    "this might be via temporary `` choking '' of an mhd outflow @xcite ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , which might imply linear polarization of the  flare @xcite .",
    "such mhd effects could plausibly also explain the initial @xmath5100  s soft tail .",
    "however , a justification for substantial @xmath15110@xmath154  s features remains so far on tentative grounds .",
    "the similarity of the  afterglow light curves to those of long bursts is , in itself , an argument in favor of the prevalent view that the afterglows of both long and short bursts can be described by the same paradigm , independently of any differences in the progenitors .",
    "this impression is reinforced by the fact that the light curve temporal slope is , on average , that expected from the usual forward shock afterglow model , and that in two short bursts ( so far ) there is evidence for what appears to be a jet break @xcite .",
    "however , while very similar , the first - order differences are revealing : the average isotropic energy of the short bursts is a factor of @xmath5100 smaller , while the average jet opening angle ( based on two breaks and one lower limit ) is a factor of @xmath155 larger @xcite . using the standard afterglow theory ,",
    "the bulk lorentz factor decay can be expressed through @xmath156 , where @xmath157 , @xmath158 is the external density in units of @xmath159 , and @xmath160 is the isotropic equivalent energy in units of @xmath161erg .",
    "if the jet break occurs at @xmath162 the jet opening angle and the total jet energy @xmath163 are _",
    "j= 9^o ( n_o / e_50)^1/8 t_d , br^3/8  , e_j = _ j^2 e ~10 ^ 49 n_o^1/4 ( e_50 t_d , br)^3/4  erg  .",
    "[ eq : short ] for the first three well - studied afterglows , grbs 050709 , 050724 , and 051221a , these equations , together with the standard afterglow expressions for the flux level as a function of time before and after the break , lead to fits @xcite which are not completely determined , allowing for grbs 050709 and 051221a either a very low or a moderately low external density , and for grb050724 a moderately low to large external density .",
    "the main uncertainties are in the jet break times , which are poorly sampled , and in the absence of high - quality radio data for any burst ( grb050724 had a reasonable radio flux , but too much variability in all bands ) .",
    "more bright short bursts like grb 051221a will be needed to improve the jet break statistics substantially .",
    "the observation of the grb - supernova grb060218/sn2006aj with _ swift _ , however , has raised the prospect of an entirely new component of emission at early times , namely , the shock breakout of the simultaneous supernova explosion . the thermal component of the prompt xrt emission , which evolves into the uvot range over the course of the first few hours after the burst , has been interpreted as the shock break - out of the grb / sn in an optically - thick wind of a wolf - rayet progenitor star @xcite ( but see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is important that the wind be sufficiently dense ; given the known redshift of this burst , the blackbody radius of the early xrt / uvot thermal component is roughly 100 times the size of a wolf - rayet star . at the same time , however , the absence of hydrogen features ( e.g.h@xmath164 ) in the sn spectrum requires such a progenitor , and disallows a red giant progenitor , which would produce a type ii sn .    the observation of a single such event in one year of _ swift_observations offers the tantalizing prospect of gathering more examples with each additional year of _ swift _  operations . in particular , intensive ground - based observations tracking the evolution of this thermal component to near - infrared , millimeter , and radio wavelengths will be useful in confirming or refuting the shock - breakout interpretation ."
