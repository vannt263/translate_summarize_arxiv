    "multi - particle quantum interference arises when several indistinguishable particles have non - vanishing probability amplitude of being found at the same site or spatial coordinate .",
    "the algebraic sum of all these probability amplitudes may lead to strong enhancement ( constructive interference ) or suppression ( destructive interference ) of the detection probability of the different possible collective states . in that , it is a pure and typical quantum phenomenon , which is worth being investigated both from a fundamental perspective and for its quantum information implications .    qualitatively different behaviours may be observed in general , depending on the bosonic or fermionic nature of the particles .",
    "the anti - symmetrization requirements @xcite for fermionic wavefunctions lead to vanishing probability of finding more than one particle on the same site ( pauli principle ) .",
    "bosons , on the contrary , show a remarked tendency to bunch together , with increased probability of coalesce on the same site @xcite or to cluster in nearby sites ( bosonic clouding @xcite ) .",
    "however , when particles evolve following hamiltonians with specific symmetries , particular fine - grained distributions can be observed with enhanced interference peaks and dips .",
    "the simplest case is the hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) effect when two particles impinge on distinct ports of a balanced beam splitter : quantum interference suppresses the coincident output ( one particle per each output ) in the case of bosons and the single - port output ( both particles in either output ) in case of fermions . in the multi - particle case ,",
    "a sort of generalised hom effect occurs for symmetric multiport beam splitters @xcite .",
    "in particular , tichy et al .",
    "@xcite showed that for a particular class of multiports , namely bell or fourier multiports , and input states with cyclic symmetry , a full suppression of most of the output combinations is observed ; a simple analytical law gives a sufficient criterion for such suppression .    from a computational point of view , calculating the output distribution of a number of indistinguishable bosons is a mathematically _ hard _ problem , in that it can not be performed efficiently on conventional ( classical ) computers .",
    "in fact , it relies on the calculation of permanents of matrices , for which an efficient classical algorithm is lacking .",
    "the realisation of such difficulty has led to the proposal @xcite of boson sampling devices as experimentally accessible platforms that could perform some task hard - to - simulate with classical resources .",
    "the specialised task of such quantum devices is to physically implement and sample the distribution of @xmath2 bosons undergoing a certain unitary evolution .",
    "the computational difficulty of a classical simulation of such process ( i.e. a classical sampling of such distribution ) increases exponentially with @xmath2 , rapidly becoming infeasible .",
    "first proof of principle experiments with photons have been reported very recently @xcite ; while not having demonstrated yet a true quantum supremacy , these experiments have pointed out that such a demonstration may not be so far .",
    "a future many - modes boson sampling experiment will likely require the implementation of an arbitrary unitary matrix , through a possibly reconfigurable @xcite linear interferometer @xcite .",
    "if the output is hard to predict classically , it may be not trivial also the certification of the correct operation of such device : in fact , several solutions to this problem have been debated @xcite .",
    "the use of particular symmetric unitaries that show rich but easily predictable multiphoton distributions has been also proposed @xcite as a convenient way to assess both the performance of a multiphoton source , as well as of the reconfigurable device itself . in the same way",
    "the two - photon hom effect on balanced beam - splitters has long been used as a diagnostic instrument for measuring two - photon indistinguishability , suppression laws for multi - port interferometers could provide a suitable means to simultaneously test the quality of a multi - photon source and of a multi - mode reconfigurable device for boson sampling experiments .",
    "of course , these could be adopted to assess the performance of a multi - photon source also outside of the boson sampling context .",
    "it has to be noted that the existence of a sharp suppression law directly comes from the symmetry characteristics of the matrix .",
    "while it has been conjectured that other suppression laws could exist for other class of symmetric unitaries , only the class of fourier matrices has been investigated extensively up to now@xcite .    in this work",
    "we address the study of interferometers implementing @xmath3-modes sylvester matrices and prove a necessary and sufficient criterion for the suppression of most output combinations , for certain input states of @xmath4 particles , either bosonic or fermionic .",
    "we further discuss possible applications for assessing the indistinguishability of multiple single - photon sources .",
    "in section [ sec : prel ] we recall some basic concepts about the evolution of multi - particle fock states through linear unitary processes and about the definition of sylvester matrices . in section [ sec : twophot ]",
    "we give a comprehensive characterization of the output distributions in the two - particle case , while in sections  [ sec : multiphot ] and [ sec : fermions ] we prove the output suppression criteria for the cases of multiple bosons and multiple fermions respectively .",
    "these sections are mainly organised as a list of propositions regarding mathematical properties of certain matrices and their consequences on the calculation of the multi - particle output distributions .",
    "finally , we discuss in section [ sec : disc ] the consequences and possible applications of the suppression criteria proved in the preceding sections , with particular regard to experiments with photons .",

    "the predictions of the suppressions laws proved above can be compared with the general trends that usually distinguish the particles behaviour , depending on their statistics . while for fermions the compatibility of prop .",
    "[ lawfermion ] with the pauli principle is intrinsic in its same proof , the behaviour of bosons , which would be expected to show an enhanced tendency to bunch together , is more peculiar . actually , similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite , we observe that many bunching events are not enhanced but included in the suppression conditions of prop .",
    "[ suppressionlaw ] .",
    "the probability of full - bunching events ( events with all @xmath2 bosonic particles on the same output mode , over the @xmath6 possible modes ) can be calculated easily : the scattering matrix is composed of identical rows with half @xmath228 and half @xmath229 elements ; by inverting the sign of the columns with negative elements ( operation which does not affect the permanent ) , we obtain a matrix of all @xmath228 , whose permanent equals @xmath230 .",
    "thus the probability of this event is @xmath231 ( from squaring eq .",
    "[ eq : permanent ] ) which is an enhancement of @xmath232 with respect to the probability of such event for distinguishable particles .",
    "this enhancement factor for full bunching events is indeed a general law for all unitary processes @xcite . with regard to anti - bunching events ( particles in all different ports ) ,",
    "it is not difficult to observe that for @xmath233 they are instead never suppressed for bosons : the scattering matrix for such an event would be a full sylvester matrix , whose permanent is proved to be non - vanishing by observing that for @xmath234 one has @xmath138 and by exploiting prop .",
    "[ nonvanishingpermanent ] .",
    "this also marks a difference with respect to bell multiports , where such events are always suppressed for an even number of bosons @xcite .",
    "an overall figure that may quantify the bunching behaviour @xcite is the average number @xmath235 of occupied modes at the output .",
    "the bosonic bunching tendency should reduce the number of occupied modes with respect to the case of distinguishable particles .",
    "figure  [ fig : occupnumber]a reports the ratio between the average number of occupied modes in the case of indistinguishable bosons and that in the case of distinguishable particles , for @xmath236 particles injected in the first modes of sylvester interferometers with up to 32 modes .",
    "this ratio is always smaller than unity , confirming the bunching behaviour .",
    "however , while from the previous discussion we know that the fraction of suppressed states is practically constant with increasing @xmath6 , this ratio looks to approach one in the same limit : the larger number of available modes makes the particles more likely to exit on different ports , approaching the classical probability on this aspect .",
    "thus , the suppression law seems to be a stronger non - classical signature than the bunching behaviour itself , which is less evident with large @xmath6 .",
    "the detailed probability of having a certain number of occupied modes is reported in figure  [ fig : occupnumber]b for the case @xmath237 , with the comparison of the distribution in the case of a fourier interferometer .",
    "the three distributions are different in shape and it is evident the shift towards a smaller number of occupied modes for the two non - classical distributions . in this particular case",
    "the average number of occupied ports is @xmath238 for both sylvester and fourier interferometers in case of identical bosons and is @xmath239 in case of distinguishable particles .    as a further analysis ,",
    "the asymptotic fraction of allowed fermionic states can be compared with the asymptotic fraction of allowed bosonic states , to evaluate the strength of the suppression law in the two cases . for large @xmath6",
    ", one reads : @xmath240 interestingly , the suppression law seems to act more severely for fermions , for large @xmath6 .",
    "note that the calculation in actually includes , for fermions , all the possible multi - particle states , even those already forbidden from the pauli principle itself",
    ". it can be observed , however , that @xmath241 for large @xmath6 , where @xmath242 are all the possible fermionic states , i.e. states with all different output ports .",
    "thus the inequality holds asymptotically also considering ( for fermions ) only the fraction of events that were not already suppressed by the simple application of the pauli principle .",
    "it is worth reminding that , besides manifesting naturally for true fermions and bosons , the effects of the statistics can be simulated by proper entangled states @xcite .",
    "thus , the laws here developed for the two kinds of particles hold true for the corresponding entangled states .    from a more applicative point of view , suppression laws such as the one presented here for sylvester interferometers may be exploited to test the indistinguishability of @xmath2-photon sources@xcite .",
    "further , they may be used , in the context of boson sampling experiments , to simultaneously check the quality of the sources and of a possible reconfigurable device @xcite , that would perform the required unitary that expresses the suppression law .",
    "the limitation of the laws for sylvester interferometers to specific values of @xmath2 may seem , at first glance , quite disadvantageous in a possible general case when it may be required to test a general @xmath2-photon source where @xmath2 may not be a power of 2 .",
    "however , one may envisage that the full @xmath2-photon interference could be used as an overall check of the source quality , but an accurate troubleshooting of possible malfunctioning or imperfections requires different subsets of single photon sources to be tested separately . to this purpose",
    "one may configure a device to implement a block - diagonal matrix , having for each block a different @xmath243-mode ( sylvester ) unitary to test separately different subsets of single - photons .",
    "an interesting perspective to test at the same time the indistinguishability of different couples of photons , without the need of reconfiguring the device is given by prop .",
    "[ twophotonarbitraryinputs ] , which is characteristic of sylvester matrices and does not hold for fourier ones .",
    "in fact , in the two photon case , whichever couple of inputs is excited , an identical fraction of outputs is suppressed .",
    "this may be particularly useful to check single - photon sources for scattershot boson sampling @xcite : there , several heralded single - photon sources are used , each coupled to a different input port , and multi - photon states ( with one photon per port , but multiple ports excited ) are generated randomly .",
    "couples of photons on random input ports are generated efficiently in such a setup and by comparing the detected output events with the predictions of prop .",
    "[ twophotonarbitraryinputs ] the indistinguishability of all the possible couples of sources may be conveniently tested .",
    "in conclusion , we have proved a necessary and sufficient criterion for the suppression of many output combinations when @xmath216 particles are injected in certain inputs of a linear interferometer with @xmath3 modes implementing a sylvester matrix . while both the bosonic and fermionic cases have been studied , the result is particularly significant for bosons , whose output distribution is hard to compute in the general case .",
    "therefore , this suppression law may be exploited for the use of sylvester multiports as benchmark devices for the indistinguishability of multiple single - photon sources or the assessment of the overall quality of reconfigurable interferometers .",
    "this study has also shown that comprehensive laws that describe the output multi - photon distribution of multi - port interferometers on the basis of the symmetry of the implemented matrix are not limited to fourier ones . indeed , further investigations could pursue the definition of similar criteria for wider class of matrices , thus giving greater insight on the features of multi - particle interference .",
