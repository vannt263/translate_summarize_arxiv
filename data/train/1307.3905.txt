    "fullerenes ( e.g. , c@xmath0 , c@xmath1 ) are very stable molecules that are very important for interstellar / circumstellar chemistry and that may explain many astrophysical phenomena such as the mysterious diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) and the intense uv bump at 2170   ( e.g. , iglesias - groth 2007 ; cataldo & iglesias - groth 2009 ) .",
    "fullerenes were discovered in the laboratory ( kroto et al .",
    "1985 ) and they have been found on earth and on meteorites . indeed , the 9577 and 9632   dibs observed in some reddened stars lie near two electronic transitions of c@xmath0@xmath6 ( foing & ehrenfreund 1994 ; see also bern et al .",
    "2013 for a recent ir detection of the c@xmath0 cation ) . at laboratory ,",
    "fullerenes are efficiently produced under h - poor conditions ( e.g. , kroto et al .",
    "1985 ) and the so - called r coronae borealis ( rcb ) stars ( extremely h - deficient stars ) were thus expected to efficiently produce fullerenes ( goeres & sedlmayr 1992 ) . in 2010 ,",
    "garca - hernndez , rao & lambert looked for c@xmath0 in a complete sample of about 30 rcbs by using the spitzer space telescope .",
    "we got the unexpected result that c@xmath0-like mid - ir features were only detected in those rcbs with some h ( garca - hernndez et al .",
    "in particular , c@xmath0-like emission features were detected in the least h - deficient rcbs dy cen and v854 cen , which also show strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features .",
    "because of the unexpected result in rcbs , then we looked for fullerenes in @xmath7240 planetary nebulae ( pne ) by using data from our own spitzer projects ; five clear fullerene detections were found .",
    "meanwhile , cami et al .",
    "( 2010 ) reported the extraordinary discovery of the first ir detection of c@xmath0 and c@xmath1 fullerenes in the young pn tc 1 .",
    "at the same time , garca - hernndez et al .",
    "( 2010 ) confirmed the surprising results obtained in rcbs , showing that all pne with fullerenes ( including tc 1 ) are low - mass c - rich pne with normal h abundances .",
    "contrary to the rcb stars , the spitzer pne spectra display c@xmath0-like features in conjunction with very weak pahs .",
    "this challenged our understanding of the fullerenes formation in space , showing that , contrary to general expectation , fullerenes are efficiently formed in h - rich circumstellar environments only .",
    "furthermore , the detection of fullerenes in rcb stars and pne suggests that large fullerenes may be formed as decomposition products of hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hac ) dust ( garca - hernndez et al .",
    "2010 , 2011a , b , 2012b ; bernard - salas et al . 2012 ; micelotta et al . 2012 ) .",
    "4395 is also displayed ( in green ) .",
    "the expected position and fwhm of the c@xmath0 feature at 3980   are marked on top of the spectra ; there is no evidence ( additional absorption ) in dy cen for the presence of this neutral c@xmath0 feature .",
    "however , there is an additional absorption band at 4000   in dy cen , which is not present in hd 115842 neither in bd @xmath8 4395.,title=\"fig : \" ]    4395 is also displayed ( in green ) .",

    "however , there is an additional absorption band at 4000   in dy cen , which is not present in hd 115842 neither in bd @xmath8 4395.,title=\"fig : \" ]        thus , fullerenes and related large c - based molecules ( e.g. , other fullerenes as stable exohedral or endohedral metallo - complexes ) might be ubiquitous in the interstellar medium and continue to be serious candidates for the dib carriers .",
    "a detailed analysis of the dibs towards fullerene - containing - accompanied or not by pah molecules - space environments is very useful to learn about the nature of the dib carriers . in this context , the recent detections of large fullerene - like molecules in rcbs and pne offer a beautiful opportunity for studying the dib spectrum of sources where fullerenes and fullerene - related molecules are abundant . here",
    "we present for the first time a detailed inspection of the optical spectra of the hot rcb star dy cen and two fullerene pne ( tc 1 and m 1 - 20 ) , which permits us to directly explore the fullerenes - dib connection .",
    "we acquired high - resolution ( r@xmath915,000 ) and high signal - to - noise ( s / n@xmath9200 ) vlt - uves optical ( @xmath73300 - 9450  ) spectra of the rcb star dy cen and pn tc 1 .",
    "the pn m 1 - 20 was also observed although at lower s / n .",
    "nearby b - type comparison stars were observed on the same dates as the corresponding science objects using the same vlt - uves set - up .",
    "the observational details are not repeated here and we refer the reader to garca - hernndez et al .",
    "( 2012a ) and garca - hernndez & daz - luis ( 2013 ) for the observations of dy cen and tc 1 ( and m 1 - 20 ) , respectively .",
    "the spitzer ir spectrum of dy cen is dominated by pah - like features with weaker c@xmath0-like features ( garca - hernndez et al .",
    "2011a ) while tc 1 displays a c@xmath0-dominated ir spectrum with very weak ( or absent ) pah bands ( cami et al .",
    "2010 ; garca - hernndez et al .",
    "the goal of our optical observations is to study the characteristics of dibs in fullerene - containing environments as well as to shed some light about the possible fullerenes - dib connection .",
    "we find that the classical and well - studied dibs ( e.g. , those at 4428 , 5780 , 5797 , 5850 , 6196 , 6379 , and 6614  ) towards dy cen are normal for its reddening .",
    "the only exception is the dib at 6284   ( possibly also the 7223  dib ) ( see garca - hernndez et al .",
    "2012a for more details ) .",
    "figure 1 ( left panel ) shows the region of 6284   for dy cen and the nearby comparison star hd 115824 .",
    "it is clear that this dib towards dy cen is stronger than towards hd 115842 , suggesting that the carrier of the 6284  dib ( along with 7223  ) is different from the rest of the classical dibs . also interesting",
    "is that we detect in dy cen a broad ( fwhm@xmath72  ) unidentified feature centered at @xmath74000  , which is seen in dy cen only ( fig . 1 ; right panel ) .",
    "note that no dibs are known at this wavelength ( see e.g. , hobbs et al .",
    "2008 ) and no molecule is known to exhibit a strong electronic transition at @xmath74000  .",
    "in addition , garca - hernndez et al .",
    "( 2012a ) have reported the non - detection of the strongest c@xmath0 electronic transitions ( e.g. , those at @xmath73760 , 3980 , and 4024  ) in dy cen ( see fig .",
    "1 , right panel ) ; c@xmath0 ir column density estimates are 1000 times higher than the optical detection limits .    similarly to dy cen , we find the strongest dibs ( e.g. , those at 5780 , 5797 , 5850 , 6196 , 6270 , 6284 , 6380 , and 6614  ) most commonly found in the ism to be normal in tc 1 and m 1 - 20 ( see garca - hernndez & daz - luis 2013 for more details ) .",
    "this may suggest that the carriers of the latter well - studied dibs are not particularly overabundant in fullerene pne .",
    "surprisingly , the well - studied dib at 4428   as well as the weaker 6309  dib ( see e.g. , hobbs et al .",
    "2008 ) are found to be unusually strong towards tc 1 ; the 4428  dib is unusually strong in m 1 - 20 too .",
    "figure 2 ( left panel ) compares the 4428   dib in tc 1 with that in the nearby comparison star hr 6334 . adopting a lorentzian profile for the 4428   dib",
    ", we obtain an eqw of 860 m , which is at least a factor of two greater than expected from the reddening in tc 1 .",
    "an unidentified broad ( fwhm @xmath75  ) feature at 6525   is also detected in tc 1 .",
    "figure 2 ( right panel ) displays the unidentified 6525  band in the tc 1 spectrum in comparison with the star hr 6334 .",
    "again , the most intense optical bands of neutral c@xmath0 are lacking in the tc 1 spectrum ; although this could be explained by the low c@xmath0 column density estimated from the c@xmath0 ir features if the neutral c@xmath0 emission peaks far away from the central star ( garca - hernndez & daz - luis 2013 ) .",
    "finally , the dy cen s unidentified 4000   band is not seen in tc 1 .",
    "table 1 compares the dibs seen in the rcb star dy cen with those in the fullerene pn tc 1 .",
    "this table naturally prompts the question of why dibs are so different in the fullerene - containing environments around rcb stars and pne ?    based on their laboratory spectroscopy of hac nanoparticles , duley & hu ( 2012 )",
    "propose that the c@xmath0 ir features seen in sources with pah - like dominated ir spectra such as dy cen are attributable to proto - fullerenes or fullerene precursors rather than to c@xmath0 .",
    "our non - detection of neutral c@xmath0 in the dy cen optical spectrum may support the duley & hu ( 2012 ) hac laboratory results .",
    "thus , the new 4000  band seen in dy cen may be related to the circumstellar proto - fullerenes ; perhaps an organic compound containing pentagonal rings .",
    "these pentagonal carbon rings are usually present in hac nanoparticles and nanotubes , suggesting that they may be intimately related with the formation process of fullerenes . in addition , the 4428   dib has been linked to fullerenes bigger than c@xmath0 and/or buckyonions such as c@xmath0@c@xmath3 and c@xmath0@c@xmath3@c@xmath5 ( iglesias - groth 2007 ) .",
    "our findings in dy cen would be consistent with fullerenes and fullerenes - containing molecules not being especially overabundant towards dy cen .",
    "on the other hand , the non detection of neutral c@xmath0 in the tc 1 optical spectrum is intriguing .",
    "tc 1 - with no or very weak pahs - is expected to be rich in c@xmath0 ( duley & hu 2012 ) .",
    "an exotic explanation may be that larger fullerenes or more complex fullerene - based molecules are present .",
    "this is suggested by the unusually strong 4428  dib .",
    "photo - absorption theoretical models of large fullerenes ( c@xmath2 , c@xmath3 , c@xmath5 ) and buckyonions ( c@xmath0@c@xmath3 , c@xmath0@c@xmath3@c@xmath5 ) ( iglesias - groth 2007 ) display strong transitions around 4428  . in this framework , the 4428  dib may be explained by the transitions ( superposition ) of fullerenes bigger than c@xmath0 and multishell fullerenes ( buckyonions ) ( iglesias - groth 2007 ) .",
    "recent studies of the 4428  dib also suggest the carrier to be a resistant , large and compact neutral molecule ( van loon et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    ".overview of dibs in fullerene - containing rcbs and pne .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the ir detection of c@xmath0 in rcb stars and pne offers the opportunity of studying dibs in environments where fullerenes are abundant .",
    "we have shown here that dibs in rcb stars and pne are remarkably different . the new 4000   band detected in the rcb star dy cen is suggested to be related with proto - fullerenes or fullerene - precursors ( garca - hernndez et al .",
    "however , the unusually strong 4428  dib ( probably also the weaker 6309  dib and the unidentified 6525  band ) in pne is suggested to be related with the presence of large fullerenes and buckyonions ( garca - hernndez & daz - luis 2013 ) as previously pointed out by iglesias - groth ( 2007 ) from theoretical considerations .    at present",
    ", the hac s photochemical processing seems to be the most promising c@xmath0 formation route ; at least in the complex circumstellar envelopes of rcb stars and pne ( see e.g. , garca - hernndez et al . 2012b ; and references therein ) but see also bern & tielens ( 2012 ) .",
    "larger fullerenes and fullerene - based molecules may form from pre - existing c@xmath0 molecules ( e.g. , dunk et al .",
    "2012 ) , opening the possibility of forming a rich family of fullerene - related molecules such as buckyonions , metallofullerenes , and fullerene adducts .",
    "these complex fullerene - based molecules may emit through the same ir vibrational modes ( e.g. , as isolated c@xmath0 and c@xmath1 ) , being indistinguishable from c@xmath0 ( and c@xmath1 ) on the basis of ir spectra alone .",
    "in particular , fullerenes and pahs may be mixed in the circumstellar envelopes of fullerene pne ( e.g. , m 1 - 20 ) and fullerene / pah adducts may form via dies - alder cycloaddition reactions ( garca - hernndez et al .",
    "2013 ) . indeed",
    ", very recent laboratory work demonstrates that fullerene / pah adducts - such as c@xmath0/anthracene diels - alder adducts - display mid - ir features strikingly coincident with those from c@xmath0 and c@xmath1 ( garca - hernndez et al ."
