    "<S> since the first limit on the ( local ) primordial non - gaussianity parameter , @xmath0 , was obtained from the _ cosmic background explorer _ ( _ cobe _ ) data in 2002 , observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) have been playing a central role in constraining the amplitudes of various forms of non - gaussianity in primordial fluctuations . the current 68% limit from the 7-year data of the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ) </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath1 , and the _ planck _ satellite is expected to reduce the uncertainty by a factor of four in a few years from now . if @xmath2 is found by _ planck _ with high statistical significance , all single - field models of inflation would be ruled out . moreover , if the _ planck _ </S>",
    "<S> satellite finds @xmath3 , then it would be able to test a broad class of multi - field models using the four - point function ( trispectrum ) test of @xmath4 . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we review the methods ( optimal estimator ) , results ( _ wmap _ 7-year ) , and challenges ( secondary anisotropy , second - order effect , and foreground ) of measuring primordial non - gaussianity from the cmb data , present a science case for the trispectrum , and conclude with future prospects . </S>"
