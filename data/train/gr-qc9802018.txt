    "spherical gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors will almost certainly be the next generation of resonant antennae , due to their multimode - multifrequency capabilities @xcite , as well as their potentially enhanced sensitivity relative to their currently operating cylindrical counterparts @xcite .",
    "conviction that this is going to be the case has encouraged a remarkable research effort within the gw community , and a variety of important topics has been addressed , ranging from theoretical to practical aspects of the problem .",
    "several countries worldwide are currently developing projects to build and operate large mass ( @xmath1100 tons ) spherical detectors @xcite .",
    "sensitivity analyses of the response of a solid elastic sphere to an incoming gw excitation are usually made under the idealised assumption that there are no dissipative effects in the antenna @xcite . in actual practice , however , such effects do exist , and translate into finite _ decay times _ of the solid s oscillations or , equivalently , into finite _",
    "linewidths _ in the system fourier spectrum .",
    "those decay times are generally much longer than the inverse frequencies of the eigenmodes  @xcite , so spectral lines are actually very narrow , and peak at the values predicted by the ideal ( frictionless ) equations of elasticity @xcite .",
    "it thus appears appropriate to model the system behaviour as undergoing _ linear _ dissipative effects , so that its eigenmode amplitudes decay _ exponentially _ , i.e. , they are proportional to the expression    @xmath2    rather than to the non - dissipative @xmath3 . here",
    "the _ quality factor q _ is assumed constant ( i.e. , time independent ) , and accounts for the linewidth of the mode with frequency @xmath4 . although it is well known @xcite that this quality factor is different for different oscillation modes , proper understanding of its variablilty is not quite as satisfactory as other aspects of the physics of the spherical gw antenna .",
    "this is partly due to the difficulties to set up a model to adequately describe the internal friction within an elastic solid body .    in the specialised literature on the subject",
    "( see @xcite and references therein ) , viscoelastic effects are often described by means of so called _ constituent equations_. these are extensions of hooke s law relating the stress and strain tensors in the solid .",
    "much like in a simple one - dimensional spring , internal friction forces can be considered proportional to the instantaneous velocity of the oscillating mass , hence constituent equations usually contain time derivatives of those tensors , and depend on a small number of viscosity parameters , to be added to the elastic lam coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath6 see below .",
    "there is however no unique way in which this idea can be carried over from a one - dimensional system into a set constituent equations for a three - dimensional solid , and so different alternatives result in different models for the purpose .    in this paper",
    "we propose to study and discuss the results of applying to a spherical gw detector the equations of various such phenomenological models , in view to determine how quality factors change from mode to mode in each case .",
    "this , it is hoped , will generate some insight into the nature of the viscous processes which take place in a specific spherical gw detector , and help to assess on the basis of spectral measurements which particular class of viscoelastic solid a given material belongs to . in turn , better understanding of material s macroscopic properties should also contribute relevant information to the currently important issue of spherical gw detector design @xcite . in section 2",
    "we present the general equations , and in the subsequent sections we successively consider the kelvin - voigt , maxwell , standard linear and genaralised mechanical models . as we shall see , the sphere s vibration eigenmodes always group into the usual families of _ toroidal _ ( purely torsional ) and _ spheroidal _ modes , but different quality factor dependences arise in different models . in section 6",
    "we present a summary of conclusions , and two appendices are added to clarify a few mathematical technicalities .",
    "gws bathing the earth are known to be extremely weak see e.g. @xcite for a review , so that the classical equations of linear elasticity are very good to describe the gw induced motions of a spherical antenna in the expected frequency range , roughly 10@xmath710@xmath8 hz . these equations are @xcite    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the field of displacements in the elastic body , and @xmath11 is the gw induced density of forces acting on the solid see @xcite for full technical details .",
    "@xmath12 is the the _ stress _ tensor , and is related to the _ strain _ tensor    @xmath13    through a set of _ constituent equations_. in the case of a non - dissipative ( ideal ) solid these are simply the expression of hooke s law . in a dissipative one",
    "these equations include _ time derivatives _ of both @xmath14 and @xmath12 to account for internal friction effects .",
    "constituent equations are of the following general type :    @xmath15    in this paper we shall limit ourselves to _ linear _ constituent equations , an excellent approach for a gw detector , as already stressed . in the simplest instance , only first order derivatives will appear in ( [ i.3 ] ) , and we shall consider this first . then we shall also devote some attention to more complicted models .    the equations of motion ( [ eqmov ] ) must be supplemented with suitable _",
    "boundary conditions_. we shall prescribe the usual ones    @xmath16    where * n * is a unit outward - pointing vector , expressing that the surface of the sphere is free from any tensions and/or tractions .",
    "this model assumes that the solid is homogeneous and isotropic , and is characterised by the following constituent equations @xcite :    @xmath17    the constants @xmath5 and @xmath18 are the usual lam coefficients describing the purely elastic behaviour of the body @xcite , while the positive coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 parametrise its _ viscous _ properties ) and _ bulk _ viscosity ( @xmath21 ) . ] , which are proportional to the change rate of the strain tensor , @xmath22 .",
    "if equations ( [ conskv ] ) are replaced into ( [ eqmov ] ) we obtain the equations of motion for @xmath10 :    @xmath23        \\,\\nabla(\\nabla{\\bf \\cdot}{\\bf s } ) + { \\bf f}({\\bf x},t )        \\label{eqmovkv}\\ ] ]    the solution to this system of coupled equations can be expressed in terms of a green function , the construction of which requires explicit knowledge of its _ eigenmode _ solutions .",
    "as is well known , the latter correspond to the free oscillations of the solid no density of external forces in the rhs of ( [ eqmovkv ] ) . as usual , we attempt to find such eigen - solutions in the factorised form    @xmath24    which results in the following ( dots on symbols stand for time derivatives ) :    @xmath25     \\nabla\\left(\\nabla{\\bf \\cdot}{\\bf s}({\\bf x})\\right ) +     \\left[\\mu\\,t(t)+\\mu'\\,\\dot t(t)\\right ]     \\nabla^2{\\bf s}({\\bf x } )     \\label{eqmovkv2}\\ ] ]    next we use the well known @xcite decomposition of a three dimensional vector field into its irrotational a divergence free components :    @xmath26    by the methods described in appendix a it can be seen that the equations satisfied by @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are ( [ a5 ] ) and ( [ a6 ] ) :    [ helmt ] @xmath30    and    [ helml ] @xmath31    since @xmath29 must fulfil _ both _ equations ( [ helmt.b ] ) and ( [ helml.b ] ) , the _ separation constants _ @xmath32 and @xmath33 are _ not _ independent . the binding relationship is established after it is realised that the solution to those equations is of the form    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is of course a _ complex _ quantity .",
    "we readily obtain    [ kq ] @xmath36^{-1 }   \\label{kq.a } \\\\     { \\cal k}^2 & \\!= \\ ! & -\\rho\\gamma^2\\left     [ \\mu+\\gamma\\,\\mu'\\right]^{-1 } \\label{kq.b }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the values @xmath35 can possibly take on are determined by the _ boundary conditions _ ,",
    "equations ( [ i.4 ] ) .",
    "the reader is referred to appendix b for a detailed description of the eigenvalue algebra of this problem . just as in the non - dissipative case ,",
    "there are seen to be two families of eigenmodes : _ toroidal _ ( purely torsional ) and _ spheroidal_. viscous effetcs are however small in practice , as inferred from the narrow _ linewidth _ of the measured resonances .",
    "this means that the following inequalities hold in any cases of interest to us :    @xmath37    where @xmath4 is the frequency of the mode considered .",
    "we shall use these inequalities to estimate the roots of the eigenvalue equation ( [ eigen ] ) ( see appendix b ) _ perturbatively _ from the non - dissipative ones , already known see @xcite for full details .",
    "clearly thus , our procedure will be valid for the lower frequency modes .",
    "we proceed sequentially for the two families of eigenmodes .",
    "these correspond to the solutions to ( see ( [ eigen ] ) )    @xmath38    which is _ formally _ identical to the toroidal eigenvalue equation for a non - dissipative solid sphere @xcite .",
    "if we call @xmath39 the toroidal wave numbers of the latter , we have    @xmath40    and hence , by equation ( [ kq.b ] ) ,    @xmath41    where the last approximation depends on the validity of the assumption ( [ approx ] ) . expression ( [ gammat ] ) nicely shows how this kelvin - voigt model predicts _ exponentially damped",
    "_ eigenmode oscillations .",
    "if we recall that such damping is expediently described in terms of a _ quality factor q _ see ( [ i.1 ] ) above then we discover that the prediction of the model is that    @xmath42    i.e. , the quality factor for toroidal modes is _ inversely proportional _ to the frequency of the mode .",
    "the _ amplitudes _ of these modes have the form    @xmath43    where the subindex @xmath44 stands for ` kelvin - voigt ' , while @xmath45 refers to the standard frictionless case , whose amplitudes are those given e.g. in reference @xcite .      a second alternative to find a non - trivial solution of the linear system ( [ bcatlastkv ] ) is to impose the condition",
    "@xmath46    this is characteristic of the _ spheroidal _ eigenmodes . by virtue of equations ( [ kq ] ) , this relationship can be translated into a condition to be fufilled by @xmath47 , and which depends on the ratios @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , as well as on the multipole index @xmath51 . in this case , as we are not dealing with an eigenvalue problem of a selfadjoint operator , complex solutions to equation ( [ sphkv ] ) are allowed indeed , expected .",
    "an exact solution of that equation implies a separation of its real and imaginary parts , followed by numerical calculations which determine the angular frequency and quality factor of the quasinormal mode at hand .",
    "we are interested in materials with long decay times , so we shall set up a perturbative solution to equation ( [ sphkv ] ) , using    @xmath52    as the small perturbative parameter . in other words ,",
    "we assume that the approximation ( [ approx ] ) holds . here",
    ", @xmath4 stands for a generic spheroidal eigenfrequency of the non - dissipative solid .",
    "obviously , the unperturbed solution , i.e. , that corresponding to @xmath53=0 , is the elastic solid s solution , already discussed in reference @xcite .",
    "we thus introduce the perturbative expansion    @xmath54    using equations ( [ kq ] ) and ( [ gamma ] ) , we obtain perturbative expansions for the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 which can be written as    @xmath57    where    [ kq ] @xmath58 %    & q_0=q=\\omega\\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho}{\\lambda+2\\mu}}\\ , \\qquad      q_1=i\\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho}{\\lambda+2\\mu}}\\left(\\gamma_1 +      \\frac{h'+2}{h+2}\\frac{\\omega}{2}\\right ) &   \\label{kq.b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the above equations , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the parameters appearing in the elastic sphere s case , and we have introduced the dimensionless ratios    @xmath61    which are both zero order quantities .",
    "we can now perform the perturbative expansion of the eigenvalue equation . in order to ease the resulting expressions ,",
    "let us introduce the following notation :    @xmath62\\epsilon   \\nonumber   \\\\ %   & \\equiv & a_0+(a_1q_1r - ia'_1)\\,\\epsilon \\label{bet4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where a prime over a @xmath63 function denotes differentiation with respect to its _ first _ argument .",
    "we note that the uppercase constants introduced above are real . with this notation ,",
    "the zeroth order form of equation ( [ sphkv ] ) is    @xmath64    which is simply the condition that @xmath4 be a spheroidal eigenvalue of the purely elastic case . on the other hand , the first order expansion of ( [ sphkv ] ) yields    @xmath65    whence , using the form of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the value of @xmath68 ensues .",
    "it can be written as    @xmath69    where the dimensionless function @xmath70 has the form[multiblock footnote omitted ]    @xmath71    we note that the first order correction obtained for @xmath47 is _",
    "real_. therefore , to this order of approximation , the frequencies of vibration remain unaltered , and are the same as those obtained for the elastic solid .",
    "moreover , @xmath66 and @xmath67 happen to be purely imaginary .",
    "therefore , the modulus of the radial functions appearing in the spatial part of spheroidal quasinormal modes of vibration will also be the same as those of the elastic solid , for the corrections to @xmath72 and @xmath73 will just introduce , to first order , a _",
    "complex phase _ factor .    summing up",
    ", we have shown that while the spheroidal normal modes of vibration of an elastic solid are given by an expression of the form @xcite",

    "the real phases @xmath78 can be computed from equations ( [ skv.1 ] ) , ( [ skv.2 ] ) and ( [ kq ] ) . nevertheless the explicit ( and cumbersome ) form of these phases is largely irrelevant and whe shall omit its explicit form here @xcite .",
    "they merely introduce a position dependent shift in the phase of the vibrations which is of order @xmath53 , therefore not likely to give rise to measurable effects .",
    "more interesting and physically relevant is the behaviour of the function @xmath70 giving the precise dependence of the quality factor on frequency .",
    "first of all , it is easily seen that , for the special case @xmath79=@xmath80 , @xmath70 is equal to 1 , and thus the quality factor is proportional to @xmath81 , as was the case with toroidal modes .",
    "but when the aforementioned equality does not hold , numerical calculations are needed .",
    "figure [ f1 ] shows that this function is not very strongly dependent on frequency , though appreciable deviations from constant behaviour can be seen at different modes .",
    "we have represented @xmath70 for the first 20 eigenvalues of the spheroidal spectrum , where the inequality ( [ approx ] ) safely holds .",
    "it is clear from equation ( [ f ] ) that holding fixed @xmath79 and @xmath82 leaves us with a _ linear _ function of @xmath80 , whose slope varies from root to root .",
    "figure [ f2 ] displays the _ quality factor _",
    "@xmath83 for the same set of eigenvalues . to be observed is the global trend towards an @xmath84 dependence of @xmath83 on @xmath4 , which exactly holds for the toroidal modes cf .",
    "( [ qtor ] ) above .",
    "fluctuations are however present in certain modes for particular values of the ratio @xmath80 of bulk to shear viscosity coefficients as a consequence of the variability of the @xmath70 function .",
    "in this section we shall consider constituent equations given by the so called maxwell model . like the kelvin - voigt ,",
    "these equations only involve first order time derivatives .",
    "as we shall see , quite different predictions will be obtained for the quality factor dependence on the mode frequencies .",
    "the maxwell model is also isotropic and homogenous , and is characterised by the following constituent equations @xcite :    @xmath85    here , the constants @xmath5 and @xmath18 are again the lam coefficients describing the elastic behaviour of the body , while the constants @xmath86 and @xmath63 parametrise the effects due to internal friction . to construct factorised solutions",
    ", we must also factorise both stress and strain ) , if @xmath10 is assumed to be separable in the fashion ( [ separ ] ) then the strain tensor is separable too , and due to the constituent equation it is easily seen that the only possible time dependence is of the form . ] :    @xmath87    the constituent equation is thus written , after separation of variables and contraction of its free indices , as    @xmath88    and hence we have the following relationship between the spatial parts of stress and strain :    @xmath89    like in the kelvin - voigt model , we shall be mainly interested in the case of small internal friction , so we shall assume    @xmath90    whence the following constituent relationship results :    @xmath91    where we have introduced a new constant , @xmath92 , defined by    @xmath93    so that we can take as the parameters characterizing the maxwell solid the set consisting of the lam coefficients @xmath5 , @xmath18 , and the parameters @xmath94 , @xmath95 which describe internal friction .",
    "let us compare equation ( [ consm ] ) with that of the kelvin ",
    "voigt model cf . (",
    "[ conskv]) once the separation of variables has been performed :    @xmath96    comparing equations ( [ consm ] ) and ( [ conskvag ] ) , we observe that the solution of the maxwell model can be carried out , as regards the spatial part of @xmath97 , following the same method used in the previous section for the kelvin  voigt model .",
    "in fact , we can directly take the expressions there derived , and make the substitutions    @xmath98    which transform equation ( [ conskvag ] ) into ( [ consm ] ) .",
    "thus the form of the solutions and boundary conditions for a maxwell viscoelastic sphere are those of appendix [ ab ] with constants @xmath99 and @xmath100 now given by the following functions of the parameter @xmath47 :    [ kqm ] @xmath101   \\label{kqm.a }   \\\\    { \\cal k}&=&i\\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho}{\\mu}}\\left(\\gamma+\\frac{\\beta}{2}\\right )    \\label{kqm.b }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the approximation ( [ apm ] ) has been taken into account , and @xmath79@xmath102@xmath48 .",
    "thus the two families of quasinormal modes of vibration are also present in this model , and we describe them in the following subsections .",
    "as already discussed , the allowed values for @xmath47 are again those making the linear system ( [ bcatlastkv ] ) compatible , and there are two alternative ways to accomplish this . the first possibility yields purely tangential ( @xmath103 ) vibrations satisfying once more the condition    @xmath104    @xmath105 being a toroidal eigenfrequency of the elastic sphere . using the relationship between @xmath47 and @xmath55 for a maxwell solid given by equation ( [ kqm ] ) ,",
    "we obtain the allowed values @xmath106 as    @xmath107    again , toroidal quasinormal modes have two fundamental properties : they have the same set of eigenfrequencies as the elastic sphere ( to first order in the parameters describing internal friction , @xmath94 in this case ) , and also exactly the same spatial part ( for _ all _ values of the viscosity parameters ) . the only difference between kelvin ",
    "voigt and maxwell solids as regards toroidal modes appears in the dependence of the quality factor on @xmath108 : as equation ( [ gammam ] ) shows , the quality factor in a linear maxwell solid increases linearly with frequency .",
    "we can express all these properties by means of the following formul :    @xmath109    relating maxwell quasinormal modes of vibration , @xmath110 , to elastic normal modes , @xmath111 , for the toroidal family .      in order to handle the spheroidal family",
    ", we shall resort again to the perturbative expansions already used in the kelvin ",
    "voigt case , and also in the toroidal family , just described .",
    "the maxwell model trivially reduces to the perfect elastic case when @xmath63=@xmath92=0 , hence we can take as the perturbative parameter    @xmath112    where @xmath4 is the elastic eigenfrequency to which @xmath35 approaches when both @xmath63 and @xmath95 approach zero .",
    "perturbative expansions in the fashion of section [ qnsphm ] can now be introduced :    @xmath113    where the first order corrections @xmath66 and @xmath67 are given by equations ( [ kqm ] ) as functions of @xmath68 :    [ kqm ] @xmath114    the zero  order ratio @xmath80 is now given by    @xmath115    with this definition , together with that of the perturbative parameter , the expressions at hand are formally identical to those of the kelvin  voigt model , and therefore the solutions to the maxwell model share all their properties with their kelvin ",
    "voigt counterparts ; the exception is the dependence of the quality factor on frequency : the product @xmath116 , which gives the exponential decay , is now _ independent of _ @xmath108 .",
    "summing up , spheroidal quasinormal modes of the maxwell solid , @xmath117 , are related to spheroidal normal modes of a perfectly elastic sphere by the equations    @xmath118    where the function @xmath119 is again given by ( [ f ] ) . in figure [ f3 ]",
    "we plot the quality factor of the first twenty eigenmodes of a maxwell solid .",
    "we note that @xmath120 is proportional to the eigenmode frequency @xmath121 , just like in the toroidal modes cf .",
    "( [ 4.13]) , but fluctuations around this behaviour are oberved for certain modes which are associated to corresponding ones in @xmath70 .    as we see , the only difference between the behaviour of maxwell and kelvin ",
    "voigt viscoelastic solids , when the internal friction effects can be considered small , appears in the dependence of @xmath83 on frequency .",
    "we must however stress that , under other conditions ( e.g. static load ) , both models show larger divergences in their physical properties  @xcite .",
    "in this section we review other models which have been proposed to address the dynamics of a viscoelastic solid .",
    "they are generalisations of those in the two previous sections .",
    "we shall however not attempt to find complete solutions to all of them , as it eventually becomes too cumbersome .",
    "we shall however discuss in this section some of their most relevant traits .",
    "the standard linear model ( slm ) for a viscoelastic solid is a generalised combination of the kelvin ",
    "voigt and maxwell models .",
    "the constituent equations take here the form :    @xmath122    where the effects of internal friction are described in this case with the aid of four constant parameters : @xmath86 , @xmath94 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 . when looking for factorised solutions , the equations of motion and the above relationship force a time dependence of the form @xmath125 for both stress and strain .",
    "when such a dependence is introduced in equation ( [ consslm ] ) , we obtain the following relationship between the spatial parts of the stress and strain tensors :    @xmath126s_{kk}({\\bf x})\\delta_{ij}+2(\\mu+\\beta'\\gamma )    \\,s_{ij}({\\bf x})\\ ] ]    the case of small internal friction is treated by first order approximation in the quantities parametrising viscous processes , i.e. ,    @xmath127    when such approximation is made , the above equation reduces to    @xmath128    where we have introduced two new constants given by    @xmath129    therefore when equation ( [ little ] ) holds , the slm reduces to a kelvin  voigt model ,",
    "i.e. , for small internal friction , both models have the same set of quasinormal modes of vibration , which are characterized by the constants @xmath5 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the latter being given , for the standard linear solid , by equations ( [ lm ] ) .",
    "the models analyzed so far are the simplest ones obtained by three dimensional generalisations of mechanical viscoelastic models composed of linear springs .",
    "they give rise to differential constituent relations , with time derivatives up to the first order .",
    "considering more involved generalisations yields differential relations involving higher order time derivatives of strain and stress see e.g. @xcite .",
    "thus , quite independently of any reference to the underlying mechanical model , we can consider general differential relations between stress and strain including any number of time derivatives . to ease the formulation of such differential constituent equations for the case of isotropic and homogenous solids",
    ", we shall introduce the trace - free parts of the strain and stress tensors , @xmath130 , @xmath131 ( usually termed _ deviatoric _",
    "components in the literature on viscoelasticy @xcite ) , and their traces , @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( _ dilational _ components ) , defined by    @xmath134    in terms of the above quantities , the linear hooke law for an elastic solid takes the form    @xmath135    while the constituent equation of an slm is written    @xmath136\\,\\sigma =    \\left[(3\\lambda+2\\mu ) + ( 3\\alpha'+2\\beta')\\ ,    \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right]\\,s\\ , \\qquad    \\left(1 + 2\\beta\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right)\\,\\sigma'_{ij } =    \\left(2\\mu+2\\beta'\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right)\\,s'_{ij}\\ ] ]    this equation can now be generalised to include higher order time derivatives .",
    "we can thus consider viscoelastic models whose constituent equation is given by    @xmath137    where we have introduced the polynomials    @xmath138    so that a general differential model is given for each set of 4@xmath139 real constants @xmath140 ,",

    "is obtained from the eigenvalue equation of the elastic model :    @xmath154    upon substitution of @xmath18 by @xmath153 , we obtain    @xmath155    we know that the only solutions to the eigenvalue equation ( [ alteigen ] ) are the _ real _ eigenfrequencies of the elastic sphere @xmath105 , and therefore the allowed values for @xmath151 are given by the implicit relationship    @xmath156    let us now write the polynomials @xmath157 and @xmath158 in the form    @xmath159    as a suitable one to imply that internal friction effects are small , letting    @xmath160    the quantities @xmath161 and @xmath162 are thus zero order in @xmath163 and dimensionless , @xmath108 being a toroidal eigenvalue of the elastic case .",
    "we then introduce an expansion for @xmath151 in the small parameter @xmath163 , whose zeroth order term corresponds to a given toroidal eigenfrequency @xmath4 of the elastic solid :    @xmath164    under the above conditions , we have    @xmath165    and the value of @xmath166 follows when introducing the above expansion into equation ( [ jqs ] ) , yielding    @xmath167    in terms of @xmath166 , the quality factor reads    @xmath168}\\ ] ]    where im[@xmath169 denotes the imaginary part of its argument .",
    "thus we observe that , as regards toroidal modes , using a general differential model gives us a _ polynomial _ in @xmath4 for @xmath170 , with no independent term , so that constant @xmath83 is not allowed by these models .",
    "the polynomial only contains _ odd _ powers of the unperturbed frequency @xmath108 . in general , whenever @xmath171@xmath1720 for even @xmath51 , the real part of @xmath166 will not vanish , and the angular frequency of the periodic component of the quasinormal modes shall undergo first order corrections .",
    "hence , in order to preserve the elastic spectrum to first order , our model must satisfy the conditions    @xmath173    provided the preceeding equation holds , the corrections to @xmath55 will be purely imaginary , and therfore the modulus of the spatial part of the modes will remain unaltered , the only effect of viscosity being the addition of a point dependent phase in the fashion of equation ( [ qnmm]).@xmath1743 .",
    "this is why it was absent in the toroidal families of the previously discussed models . ]",
    "the calculation for the spheroidal quasinormal modes can be performed along the same lines but , as we have seen , the algebra is considerably more involved already in the simplest models . it does naturally become more cumbersome as the order of the model increases , so we omit a detailed discussion of its technicalities here .",
    "in this paper we have addressed the problem of whether it is possible to systematically characterise the linewidths of the oscillation eigenmodes of a given spherical gw detector . to this end",
    "we have considered various phenomenological models , selected from the specialised literature on the subject , and solved the equations of motion in the case of our interest .",
    "different models are seen to predict different frequency dependences of the quality factors for the lower modes , which are the ones we have paid attention to , and the ones relevant for gw detection purposes .",
    "for example , in a kelvin - voigt solid the @xmath83 of a given mode appears to be inversely proportional to its frequency , while in a maxwell solid it is directly proportional to it though significant fluctuations around these behaviours also show in both cases .",
    "it is not presupposed that a particular model applies to a particular elastic material , or class of materials .",
    "our analysis should rather help to understand , _ a posteriori _ of experimental spectral measurements , whether the solid at hand belongs in this or that phenomenological category .",
    "this will contribute one more criterion in the selection of the most suitable alloy the upcoming spherical gw detectors will be made with , as different viscoelastic models ( kelvin - voigt , maxwell ,  ) are associated with other relevant properties of the solid , such as e.g.  their response to static load or suspension system .",
    "these are of course of the utmost practical importance for an earth - based gw observatory .",
    "a well - behaved three - dimensional vector field @xmath175 can be expressed as the sum of an irrotational , @xmath28 , and a divergence free , @xmath27 , vector fields , respectively called the _ longitudinal _ and _ transverse _ components of @xmath175 @xcite :                              we describe in this appendix the algebraic operations which lead to the solution to the eigenvalue problem in a viscoelastic sphere .",
    "equations ( [ eqmov ] ) ought to be solved , subject to the boundary conditions ( [ i.4 ] ) .",
    "the latter can be cast in explicit vector form :          where @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 are ( so far ) undetermined integration constants , and * l*@xmath102@xmath190*x*@xmath191@xmath192 is the `` angular momentum '' operator . upon substitution of ( [ totkv ] ) into ( [ eqmov ] ) it is readily seen that the functions @xmath193 and @xmath194 are themselves also solutions to corresponding helmholtz equations :          where @xmath200 are _ spherical _ bessel functions of the first kind and @xmath201 are spherical harmonics .",
    "the solutions ( [ pfsol ] ) are those possessing regularity properties in the whole interior and boundary of the solid .",
    "we thus have      these expressions ought to be substituted now into ( [ totkv ] ) , and then into ( [ bcondkv ] ) recall that * s*=@xmath203 + @xmath204 .",
    "it is found thet these are equivalent to the following _ homogeneous linear system _        [ betas ] @xmath206 \\\\",
    "\\beta_2(z ) & \\equiv & \\frac{d^2}{dz^2}\\left[j_l(z)\\right ] \\\\",
    "\\beta_3(z ) & \\equiv & \\mbox{\\large $ \\frac{1}{2}$}\\,\\beta_2(z ) +       \\left\\{\\mbox{\\large $ \\frac{l(l+1)}{2}$}-1\\right\\}\\,\\beta_0(z ) \\\\",
    "\\beta_4(z , a ) & \\equiv & \\beta_2(z)-\\frac{a}{2}j_l(z )    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the system ( [ bcatlastkv ] ) is to be satisfied by the constants @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 , but has no meaningful solution unless the system matrix is _ singular _ ,",
    "i.e. , if its determinant vanishes .",
    "therefore      this is an equation for the parameter @xmath35 , on which @xmath55 and @xmath56 depend through equations ( [ kq ] ) .",
    "clearly , there are _ two _ families of solutions , or _ eigenmodes _ , to ( [ eigen ] ) associated to the vanishing of either of the two factors in its lhs , i.e. , @xmath208 _ or _ the determinant of the displayed 2@xmath1912 matrix .",
    "they are called _ toroidal _ and _ spheroidal _ solutions , respectively .",
