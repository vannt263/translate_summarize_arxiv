    "the processes    @xmath5    @xmath6    are fundamental weak reactions between a muon and the nucleon ( [ m+p.eq ] ) and the simplest nucleus ( [ m+d.eq ] ) , respectively .",
    "historically , they have played an important role in establishing the helicity structure as well as the universality of the weak interaction .",
    "this paper is dedicated to the pioneers of this era .",
    "e. zavattini , who inspired us with his experiments and enthusiasm for this research direction and v.p .",
    "dzhelepov and v.g .",
    "zinov , whose leadership stimulated many key experiments in muon capture and muon - catalyzed fusion at the jinr , dubna .",
    "today , the electro - weak interaction is understood and verified with amazing precision at the quark - lepton level .",
    "thus , the charged lepton current serves as a clean probe for exploring the weak couplings and qcd structure of the nucleon and nuclei . over the last decade",
    "the connection between nucleon and even two - nucleon observables at low energies and fundamental qcd has been elucidated by the development of modern effective field theories ( eft ) . in this framework ,",
    "process ( [ m+p.eq ] ) can be calculated in a model - independent way with controlled systematic uncertainty . as the eft predictions derive from basic concepts of explicit and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking",
    ", their experimental verification is an important test of our understanding of the underlying qcd symmetries . as regards the two - nucleon sector ,",
    "eft calculations have proved that reaction ( [ m+d.eq ] ) is closely related to fundamental weak reactions of astrophysical interest , like @xmath7 fusion in the sun and @xmath8 scattering observed at the sudbury neutrino observatory . a precision measurement of reaction ( [ m+d.eq ] )",
    "comes closest to calibrating these extremely feeble reactions under terrestrial conditions .",
    ".hyperfine energy splittings and recent calculations of capture rates from hfs states of @xmath9(1s ) and @xmath10(1s ) atoms .",
    "theoretical predictions  @xcite updated with recently calculated radiative corrections  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the mucap experiment is ongoing , with improved systematics , ten times higher statistics , and about three times reduced uncertainties expected for the final result .",
    "table  [ systematics.tab ] compiles the muon atomic physics uncertainties affecting the final mucap result on .",
    "evidently , several subtle effects have to be accurately controlled to achieve the desired sub - percent precision . according to fig .",
    "[ kin.fig ] the corrections due to @xmath11 formation depend on the two rates @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the molecule formation rate @xmath12 will be measured in a dedicated experiment with the mucap detector .",
    "neutron detectors have been installed to study the effect of @xmath13 on the capture neutron time distribution , but further theoretical investigations should try to clarify the present conflicting situation and estimate the amount of density dependence of this rate between @xmath14 and the density of mucap @xmath15 . regarding the chemical impurities , a sophisticated continuous filtering system  @xcite cleans the tpc gas to ultra - high purity of @xmath16 10  ppb .",
    "the purity is monitored _ in - situ _ during the experiment , by observing capture recoils from the capture process @xmath17 in the tpc , which occurs after muons have been transferred from hydrogen atoms to trace impurities like n@xmath18 and h@xmath18o .",
    "corrections are applied to the measured lifetime after calibrating these processes with known concentrations of impurities , and new values for these transfer rates will be determined by mucap .",
    "finally , muonic hydrogen atoms can diffuse away from their point of origin and thus introduce a time dependent correction to the detector acceptance .",
    "while the @xmath19 cross section is sufficiently large to keep @xmath9 atoms within millimeters , the famous ramsauer - townsend minimum in the @xmath20 cross sections allows @xmath10 diffusion over centimeter distances at mucap conditions . since 2006 , the protium gas used in the experiment is isotopically cleaned to c@xmath21 10 ppb with a custom built cryogenic separator . for the final analysis diffusion effects",
    "should be simulated for realistic experimental conditions , following the work in  @xcite .",
    "muon capture on the deuteron , reaction ( [ m+d.eq ] ) , is the simplest weak interaction process on a nucleus which can both be calculated and measured to a high degree of precision .",
    "while the one - body contributions to this process are well defined by the elementary amplitudes of process  ( [ m+p.eq ] ) , the challenge lies in the short - distance part of the axial two - body current .",
    "traditionally , these effects have been modeled with meson exchange currents  @xcite . during the last few years eft calculations",
    "have developed a model - independent description , where the two - nucleon current is parameterized by a single low energy constant which integrates all the poorly constrained short - distance physics .",
    "this constant is called @xmath2 in the pion - less theory  @xcite and @xmath22 in chpt  @xcite .",
    "exactly the same constant dominates the theoretical uncertainty in fundamental weak astrophysics processes , like the @xmath23 reaction , which is the primary energy source in the sun and the main sequence stars , and the @xmath24 reaction , which provided convincing evidence for solar neutrino oscillation , as both its charged current and neutral current modes are observed simultaneously at the sudbury neutrino observatory  @xcite . while eventually one can hope to calculate this parameter on the lattice  @xcite , at the moment it has to be determined from experiment .",
    "alas , existing experiments on the axial - vector interaction in the two - nucleon system are of limited precision  @xcite , so that one has to resort to the theoretically more complex three - nucleon system .",
    "a measurement of @xmath25 capture could fix @xmath2 , @xmath22 within a fully consistent framework and could determine the solar pp fusion and @xmath8 cross sections at essentially the same precision as the measured capture rate .",
    "however , the best existing capture experiments  @xcite are not precise enough and the most precise result  @xcite differs from modern theory by 2.9 standard deviations .",
    "the new musun experiment  @xcite will measure the capture rate  from the doublet state of the muonic deuterium atom @xmath10 to a precision of better than 1.5  % .",
    "the measurement , based on the mucap techniques , will have a significantly higher precision than previous experiments on @xmath26 capture and on other weak two - nucleon reactions , like @xmath27 scattering . as seen in fig .",
    "[ kin.fig ] ( bottom ) , for a clear interpretation and for the accumulation of sufficient capture statistics , the target conditions should be chosen such that the @xmath28 doublet state dominates and the formation of @xmath29he is minimized .",
    "although the kinetics is complicated , the @xmath28 system has been intensively studied as the prototype for resonant muon - catalyzed fusion  @xcite .",
    "our optimization shown in fig .",
    "[ time.fig ] indicates that the target density should be increased to @xmath30=0.05 , to accelerate the relatively slow hyperfine transition according to the rate @xmath31 , where @xmath32 at t = 30 k. the low temperature is preferable to reduce @xmath33 to its non - resonant value , suppress upwards hfs transitions to the quartet state and provide a large difference between doublet and quartet formation rates  and , respectively , which allows for _ in - situ _ monitoring of the hfs kinetics by the observation of muon - catalyzed fusion reactions  @xcite .",
    "table  [ systematics.tab ] shows that the kinetic uncertainties to  can be reduced to an almost negligible 0.5   at these conditions .",
    "however , the target purity requirements for the musun experiment are extremely stringent ( 1 ppb ) as the transfer rates to nitrogen scale with @xmath30 and are measured to be four times higher for @xmath10 compared to @xmath9 atoms  @xcite .",
    "dedicated experiments to remeasure these rates and to develop ultra - clean filtering and monitoring techniques are foreseen .",
    "we also will study the residual muon polarization in @xmath10 , which might be observable due to the relatively slow hyperfine transition rate .    the schematic set - up of the musun experiment",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ setup.fig ] , where a small high density cryo - tpc filled with ultra - pure deuterium is embedded in an insulation vacuum vessel at the center of the electron tracking detectors .",
    "the fermi constant @xmath34 is a fundamental constant of nature , which , together with @xmath35 and @xmath36 , defines the gauge couplings of the electroweak sector of the standard model .",
    "it is directly related to the free muon decay rate , but , in the past , the extraction of @xmath34 from @xmath37 was limited by unknown 2-loop radiative corrections . with those calculated  @xcite , the muon lifetime @xmath38 ,",
    "known to 18 ppm , became the limiting factor .",
    "moreover , the precise knowledge of the @xmath39 decay rate @xmath40 is required for the muon capture experiments described above , as the capture rates are derived from the difference @xmath41 .",
    "the mulan experiment is a measurement of @xmath38 to 1 ppm precision .",
    "a time - structured muon beam is generated by a fast electrostatic kicker and stopped in a target with internal or external magnetic field , to control the initial muon polarization . during the beam off",
    "period positrons are recorded by a highly - segmented , symmetric detector .",
    "a first publication  @xcite on a limited data set gives @xmath42(mulan ) = 2.197013(24 ) @xmath43s .",
    "the updated world average @xmath42(world ) = 2.197019(21 ) @xmath43s determines the fermi constant @xmath34(world ) = 1.166371(6 ) @xmath44 10@xmath45 gev@xmath46 ( 5 ppm ) .",
    "recently , the fast experiment  @xcite released a new result @xmath42(fast ) = 2.197083(35 ) @xmath43s .",
    "the next major step is to improve the precision to 1 ppm .",
    "mulan has already collected the required two orders of magnitude higher statistics , which is currently being analyzed ."
