    "we find maxima at @xmath72 .",
    "the minimum at @xmath73 is due to the finite size of the obstacle , so only few particles are scattered into the region directly behind the obstacle .    due to the different sense of the transferred angular moments resulting from collisions at the lower or at the upper side ( in @xmath16-direction ) of the particles the angular momentum @xmath74 of the particles which fall into a certain interval of scatter angle @xmath75 has a negative sign for @xmath76 and a positive for @xmath77 .",

    "when the particles collide with the obstacle they lose kinetic energy due to damping .",
    "the larger the distance @xmath79 of the particles in vertical direction from the obstacle ( see fig .  [ setup ] ) the smaller is the dissipated kinetic energy .",
    "hence , the particles moving with large @xmath16 ( outer particles ) are faster than others with lower @xmath79 ( inner particles ) . therefore , the stream particles undergo more intensive collisions from the outer side ( large @xmath79 ) than from the inner ( smaller @xmath79 ) .",
    "particles scattered into the region behind the obstacle have a higher angular velocity since they need to be pushed by faster particles multiple times from the same side to reach this region .",
    "these effects are the reason for the distribution @xmath74 of the angular momentum . in agreement with the above arguments fig .",
    "[ rotation ] shows that the distribution of the absolute value of the averaged angular momentum @xmath74 of particles decreases with increasing @xmath7 . in the range",

    "we find large error bars according to bad statistics  only few particles are scattered directly behind the obstacle .",
    "the maxima of the distribution @xmath82 are close to the intensity maxima .",
    "there seems to be a preferred region for the scatter angle where the traces of the particles are almost in parallel , i.e. where energy dissipation is low .",
    "we will come back to this presumption when we discuss the granular temperature field of the stream .      the impact of the stream particles on the target results in an effective force between the stream and the obstacle . with the strong simplifying assumptions that the particles have no rotational degree of freedom and",
    "the particles interact only with the obstacle but not with each other one obtains from kinetic gas theory a theoretical approximation for the force @xmath2 @xmath83 the force is the transferred momentum per time which is the mass of the particles colliding with the obstacle in the time @xmath84 times the stream velocity .",
    "( [ ftheor ] ) implies the relations    @xmath85    [ f ]    in the following we will investigate each of the relations  ( [ f ] ) numerically for granular particles for which the simplifying assumptions are evidently _ not _ provided .",
    "the force acting on the obstacle fluctuates according to the irregularities of the stream , hence , to get reliable values we averaged the force for each data point over a certain time that corresponds to approximately 500 rows of stream particles colliding with the obstacle .",
    "as shown in the results this time is sufficient to generate very small error bars .    as we see from fig .",
    "[ foverdichte ] the simulation is in good agreement with eq .",
    "( [ frho ] ) for the force @xmath2 as a function of the stream density @xmath6 of the input stream .",
    "the function @xmath86 can be fitted to @xmath87    in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ fradius ] ) the acting force @xmath2 is also linear in its dependency on the radius @xmath9 of the obstacle as drawn in fig .",
    "[ foverradius ] ( crosses and solid line ) .",
    "it can be expressed by the fit @xmath88    there exists a resulting force @xmath89 for @xmath90 since as shown below even a _ very _ small obstacle hinders the stream particles ( of finite radius ) and results in a certain resistance for the stream .",
    "thus , we find the surprising result that the functional form of the acting force as a function of the density of the stream @xmath6 ( eq .  ( [ frho ] ) ) and of the radius @xmath9 of the obstacle ( eq .  ( [ fr ] ) ) which we measured in our simulations equals that of the crude approximation eq .",

    "this coincidence is not trivial since the stream particles which collide with the obstacle build up a characteristic `` corona '' around the obstacle as it can be seen in fig .",

    "there seems to be a critical value for the driving parameter ( in  @xcite the temperature ) when the gap appears .    for the region of parameters applied in our simulations the stream width @xmath98 does not influence the results . for obstacle",

    "the density in front of the obstacle is very high .",
    "the particles which join this high density region are of low temperature .",
    "the temperature rises up to a characteristic distance from the surface of the obstacle and has its maximum in the region where the incoming stream particles collide with the corona which surrounds the obstacle , i.e. the location of maximum temperature coincides with the boundary of the corona . as discussed in the context of figs .",
    "[ fig ] and [ snapflat ] for smaller obstacle size ( or lower stream velocity ) a region of low density and high temperature forms in front of the obstacle , i.e. the highest density can be found in a certain distance from the obstacle .",
    "the region of highest temperature does not necessarily coincide with the border of the corona .",
    "the fields of granular temperature and density as well as the appearance of the gap are reminiscent to the behavior of a bullet flying in air with supersonic velocity .",
    "it has been shown before that rapid granular flows may contain spatial regions in which the flow is supersonic  @xcite .",
    "the properties of the flow and the possible embedding into a continuum mechanics theory are subjects of work in progress  @xcite .",
    "we investigated numerically the properties of a stream of granular particles which is scattered by an obstacle and the force acting upon the obstacle as a function of the stream density @xmath6 , the stream velocity @xmath5 and the obstacle size @xmath9 using molecular dynamics technique .",
    "the fields of granular temperature and density have been generated from the molecular dynamics data by coarse graining .",
    "surprisingly we find the force to be proportionally to the density @xmath6 , the obstacle size @xmath9 , and for high stream velocities proportionally to @xmath109 i.e. @xmath110 as one would expect from a stream of non - interacting hard spheres .",
    "for lower velocities we find that the force deviates from the @xmath111 law , but still we find a linear law for the force as a function of @xmath9 and @xmath6 .",
    "this deviation occurs at a critical value for the stream velocity @xmath5 . at the same velocity we observe a gap forming in between the surface of the obstacle and the corona of stream particles which agglomerate and rest around the obstacle .",
    "this gap rises when the stream velocity decreases .",
    "the widths of this gap which is filled with granular gas at high temperature grows with decreasing stream velocity .",
    "this agglomeration of particles in front of the obstacle leads to an effective obstacle size @xmath112 larger than @xmath9 .",
    "the shape of the corona does not sensitively depend on the shape of the obstacle , the functional form of the force @xmath110 remains invariant if the spherical obstacle is replaced by a flat one",
    ".    for the case of a sphere of radius @xmath113 in a viscous fluid one finds for very low stream velocity ( low reynolds number ) experimentally the stokes law @xmath114 .",
    "this result can be derived analytically from the continuum mechanical navier - stokes equation for incompressible flow  @xcite @xmath115 as result of the pressure in front and behind the obstacle .",
    "the conditions of low reynolds number and high viscosity assure that streamlines of continuous media cling to each point of the obstacle , which is a condition for the derivation of the stokes law . for the case of a granular material",
    "this condition does not hold , i.e. the pressure which acts from behind the obstacle is zero , or at least very close to zero since as visible from the snapshots figs .",
    "[ fig ] , [ snapflat ] and  [ fig : gapsnaps ] and from the density fields in fig .",
    "[ fig : fields ] there are almost no particles which collide with the obstacle from behind . according to these considerations",
    "we conclude that one can not expect stokes law even for very low stream velocity @xmath5 because the precondition of a homogeneous medium with high viscosity does not hold .",
    "the field data of the granular temperature and the density show that for large obstacle size the location of maximum temperature coincides with the boundary of the corona . for the case of smaller obstacles",
    "the highest density is found in a certain distance from the obstacle whereas the region close to the obstacle is filled by a diluted granular gas of high temperature . for fixed obstacle size this gap can be found below a certain stream velocity @xmath5 .",
    "it grows rapidly for decreasing @xmath5 .",
    "instead of using molecular dynamics technique for the simulation of the dynamics of the granular material which requires large computational effort , one could apply an `` event driven algorithm '' which works much faster than molecular dynamics .",
    "using such algorithms one does not solve newton s equation of motion for each single collision between the grains but one calculates the relative tangential and normal velocities after each collision as functions of the relative impact velocities ( normal and tangential ) .",
    "therefore one needs the normal and tangential viscoelastic restitution coefficients which are functions of the material constants and the impact velocities . for the approximation",
    "that the dilatation is independent of the impact velocities pao and others analytically calculated the normal restitution coefficient  @xcite .",
    "a more general approach for the derivation of the coefficients of restitution based on physical interaction forces between colliding spheres  @xcite has been given in @xcite .",
