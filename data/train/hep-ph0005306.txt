    "although the let channel has relatively lower rate , it may nevertheless lead to about @xmath219 events after including the branching fraction , which is well above the background expectation . for the @xmath171 channel , both signal and background rates are slightly smaller than the @xmath26 case , but the vector signal rate is still sufficiently above background to be observable . the let amplitude in this case is below background as was already seen in the model discussions .",
    "it is important to know how well one can reconstruct the signal and contrast it with the background beyond simple event counting . in fig .",

    "all cuts are imposed and the branching fraction for @xmath26 decay is included .",
    "we see a broad resonance around @xmath178 in scalar model due to its large width . for the vector case , however , the width is narrower in general and the signal peaks above the scalar model for @xmath188 in a distinctive manner .",

    "the statistical accuracy for the cross section measurement is defined as @xmath223 where @xmath52 and @xmath224 are the number of signal and background events respectively and we have ignored the experimental systematic effects .",
    "we find that partial widths can be probed up to about @xmath4 accuracy for @xmath225 within the unitarity bounds shown as dotted lines ( eq .  [ sbound ] ) . in the region above the curve labeled @xmath226",

    "it is easy to see that the scalar model is distinguishable at the 5@xmath233 level from the non - resonant case within the unitarity limits given in eq .",

    "we have studied the couplings of the top quark to tev resonances that occur in models in which the electroweak symmetry is broken by a strong interaction .",
    "our study is motivated by the fact that in many models the top quark plays a special role in the breaking of electroweak symmetry .",
    "we have explored the possibility that the new physics is realized as a scalar resonance or a vector resonance near 1 tev , as well as the case where the resonance is beyond reach ( let ) . for the scalar model , we used partial wave unitarity to constrain the parameters as shown in sec .",

    "[ vector ] .",
    "we found within these constraints , that signal rates in these models at future lepton colliders can be well above the sm backgrounds after judicial cuts are applied .",
    "the models can be distinguished from each other by systematically studying two different final states .",
    "typically one would see a broad scalar resonance @xmath52 , or a relatively narrow vector resonance @xmath18 in the @xmath26 channel and a narrow vector resonance @xmath20 in the @xmath171 channel .",
    "in particular , we illustrated our results at a 1.5 tev linear collider with an integrated luminosity of 200 fb@xmath2 .",
    "one expects to observe about 120 events for either @xmath239 or @xmath240 including final state identification .",
    "even if the lower - lying resonances are inaccessible at the collider , one can still observe a statistically significant deviation as predicted by the let for the @xmath26 final state from the perturbative sm expectation . finally ,",
