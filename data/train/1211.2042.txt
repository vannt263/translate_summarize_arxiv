    "our goal in this series of papers is to obtain a uniform construction of tensor products of one - column kirillov - reshetikhin ( kr ) crystals . as a consequence",
    "we shall prove the equality @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the macdonald polynomial @xmath3 specialized at @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the graded character of a simple lie algebra coming from tensor products of one - column kr modules .",
    "both the macdonald polynomials and kr modules are of arbitrary untwisted affine type .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 is a dominant weight for the simple lie subalgebra obtained by removing the affine node .",
    "macdonald polynomials and characters of kr modules have been studied extensively in connection with various fields such as statistical mechanics and integrable systems , representation theory of coxeter groups and lie algebras ( and their quantized analogues given by hecke algebras and quantized universal enveloping algebras ) , geometry of singularities of schubert varieties , and combinatorics .",
    "our point of departure is a theorem of ion  @xcite , which asserts that the nonsymmetric macdonald polynomials at @xmath4 are characters of demazure submodules of highest weight modules over affine algebras .",
    "this applies for the langlands duals of untwisted affine root systems ( and type @xmath7 in the case of nonsymmetric koornwinder polynomials ) .",
    "our results apply to the symmetric macdonald polynomials for the untwisted affine root systems .",
    "the overlapping cases are the simply - laced affine root systems @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    it is known  @xcite that certain affine demazure characters ( including those for the simply - laced affine root systems ) can be expressed in terms of kr crystals , which motivates the relation between @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for types",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath13 , the above mentioned relation between @xmath11 and @xmath12 was achieved in  @xcite by establishing a combinatorial formula for the macdonald polynomials at @xmath4 from the ram  yip formula  @xcite , and by using explicit models for the one - column kr crystals  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that , in types @xmath8 and @xmath13 , the one - column kr modules are irreducible when restricted to the canonical simple lie subalgebra , while in general this is not the case . for the cases considered by ion  @xcite , the corresponding kr crystals are perfect .",
    "this is not necessarily true for the untwisted affine root systems considered in this work , especially for the untwisted non - simply - laced affine root systems .    in this work",
    "we provide a type - free approach to the connection between @xmath11 and @xmath12 for untwisted affine root systems .",
    "lenart s specialization  @xcite of the ram  yip formula for macdonald polynomials uses paths in the quantum bruhat graph ( qbg ) , which was defined and studied in @xcite in relation to the quantum cohomology of the flag variety . on the other hand , naito and",
    "sagaki  @xcite gave models for tensor products of kr crystals of one - column type in terms of projections of level - zero lakshmibai ",
    "seshadri ( ls ) paths to the classical weight lattice .",
    "hence we need to bridge the gap between these two approaches by establishing a bijection between paths in the quantum bruhat graph and projected level - zero ls paths . for crystal graphs of integrable highest weight modules over quantized universal enveloping algebras of kac - moody algebras , lenart and postnikov",
    "had already established a bijection between the ls path model and the alcove model  @xcite .",
    "this bijection was refined and reformulated in @xcite using littelmann s direct characterization of ls paths  @xcite and deodhar s lifting construction for coxeter groups  @xcite .    in this first paper",
    "we set the stage for the connection between the projected level - zero ls path model  @xcite and the quantum alcove model  @xcite .",
    "we begin by establishing a _ first lift _ from the parabolic quantum bruhat graph ( pqbg ) to the bruhat order of the affine weyl group .",
    "this is a parabolic analogue of the fact that the quantum bruhat graph ( qbg ) can be lifted to the affine bruhat order  @xcite , which is the combinatorial structure underlying peterson s theorem  @xcite ; the latter equates the gromov - witten invariants of finite - dimensional homogeneous spaces @xmath14 with the pontryagin homology structure constants of schubert varieties in the affine grassmannian .",
    "we obtain diamond lemmas for the pqbg via projection of the standard diamond lemmas for the affine weyl group .",
    "we find a _",
    "second lift _ of the pqbg into a poset of littelmann  @xcite for level - zero weights and characterize its local structure ( such as cover relations ) in terms of the pqbg .",
    "littelmann s poset was defined in connection with ls paths for arbitrary ( not necessarily dominant ) weights , but the local structure was not previously known .",
    "then , we prove the tilted bruhat theorem , which is a quantum bruhat graph analogue of the deodhar lift  @xcite for coxeter groups .",
    "this will turn out to be important in our second paper  @xcite , where we establish the connection between the ls path model and the quantum alcove model .",
    "our proof uses the novel notion of quantum length , which relies on the fact that the pqbg is strongly connected when using only simple transpositions ; see  @xcite .",
    "the theorem ultimately follows from the application of the diamond lemmas for the qbg . finally , we prove the natural generalization from the qbg to the pqbg of postnikov s lemma  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1 ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) ) , which compares the weights of two paths in the former graph ( the weight measures the down steps ) ; note that part ( 1 ) of postnikov s lemma , stating the strong connectivity of the qbg , is generalized earlier in this paper . besides our second paper on kr crystals , the generalization of postnikov s lemma might find applications to parabolic versions of the results in  @xcite on the quantum cohomology of flag varieties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section.notation ]",
    "we set up the notation for untwisted affine root systems and affine weyl groups . in section  [ section.orbits ]",
