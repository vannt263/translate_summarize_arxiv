    "60 years ago , frenkel and kontorova introduced a simple model which has become popular in many fields of solid - state physics and nonlinear dynamics @xcite .",
    "they invented their model in order to describe the motion of a dislocation in a crystal @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model has become also a model for an adsorbate layer on the surface of a crystal@xcite , for ionic conductors @xcite , for glassy materials @xcite , for charge - density - wave ( cdw ) transport @xcite , for chains of coupled josephson junctions @xcite , and for sliding friction @xcite .    the fk model is a chain of particles with mass @xmath0 coupled by a harmonic nearest - neighbor interaction with stiffness @xmath1 .",
    "it is under the influence of an external spatially periodic potential with periodicity @xmath2 and strength @xmath3 .",
    "here we study the nonequilibrium behavior of the fk model driven by a force @xmath4 .",
    "we assume energy dissipation due to a usual damping force with a damping constant @xmath5 .",
    "after rescaling time and space , one gets the following equation of motion in dimensionless units : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the time and space units are @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions , i.e. , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of particles and @xmath14 is an arbitrary integer .",
    "note that the periodic boundary condition implies that the average particle density @xmath15 is constant , i.e. , @xmath16 due to symmetries @xmath17 can be restricted to @xmath18 $ ] without loss of generality .",
    "the dynamical behavior of the fk model has already been studied in several limits : ( i ) in the overdamped limit ( i.e. , @xmath19 can be neglected ) for large @xmath13 @xcite , ( ii ) in the limit of zero damping and driving ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) for @xmath21 near integer values allowing well separated @xmath22 kinks @xcite as well as for the most incommensurate value ( i.e. , the golden mean ) of @xmath21 @xcite , and ( iii ) in the underdamped case for small @xmath13 ( @xmath23 ) @xcite . in a series of papers braun _ et al . _",
    "have studied recently the underdamped dynamics of a generalized fk model with @xmath24 but @xmath17 near zero and @xmath25 @xcite .    in this series of two papers ,",
    "we study the underdamped fk model for large numbers of particles ( i.e. , @xmath24 ) . we do not restrict ourselves to values of @xmath21 near integer or half integer values where the dynamical behavior can be described in terms of kinks .",
    "the system has stationary , periodic , quasi - periodic , and chaotic solutions .",
    "of special interest is the transition from stationarity to sliding , the so - called _ pinning - depinning transition _ , and the backward process . in the first paper",
    ", we investigate the periodic and quasi - periodic solutions .",
    "the second paper will be concerned with the depinning - pinning transition between stationary states and spatio - temporal chaos .",
    "preliminary results have already been published in a conference proceedings @xcite .    in section  [ sd ]",
    "we will see that the fk model spontaneously forms spatial - temporal patterns as many other spatially extended systems driven far from equilibrium @xcite .",
    "these patterns are caused by bistability and instability of the _ uniform sliding state_. in the uniform sliding state all particles perform exactly the same regular and periodic motion .",
    "different particles differ only in the phase of this motion .",
    "the phase difference of two neighboring particles is everywhere the same .",
    "that is , the density of particles is on average constant along the chain .",
    "the uniform sliding state is the only nonstationary state in the overdamped limit @xcite but it has also be studied in the underdamped case @xcite .",
    "the discreteness of the chain leads to several _ resonances _ in the underdamped limit @xcite .",
    "the consequence is bistability . for spatially extended bistable systems it is well - known that domain - like patterns are possible @xcite . in the fk model",
    "these domains can be characterized by the average particle density @xmath15 and the average particle velocity @xmath26 .",
    "we find that states with two or three different types of domains survive in the long - time limit .",
    "the number and the width of the domains can vary , leading to a quite large number of possible solutions .",
    "because of different average velocities in different domain types , the motion in the domain solutions is quasi - periodic . assuming that @xmath17 and @xmath26 are slowly varying functions in time and space , we derive an approximate equation of motion for them . with its help",
    "we understand why the domains do not disappear in the long - time limit and why there are not more than three different domain types .",
    "furthermore it turns out that the state in the long - time limit can be understood as a spatially chaotic solution of a corresponding dynamical system .",
    "a special variant of these domain solutions is the _ traffic - jam state _ where the particle velocity in one domain is zero @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ vf ] we derive two different but mathematically equivalent formulas for the relation between the force @xmath27 and the average sliding velocity @xmath26 . in section  [ us ] the periodic solution ( i.e. , the uniform sliding state ) and its stability are discussed .",
    "the domain - like states are investigated in section  [ sd ] . in section  [ con ]",
    "the main part of the paper concludes with some remarks concerning possible experimental observations of these domain - like states and similarities to other pattern forming systems .",
    "the appendices describe our numerical and analytical scheme to obtain the uniform sliding state and to analyze its stability .",
    "the _ average sliding velocity _ @xmath26 of the chain reads @xmath28 plotting the measured or calculated values of @xmath26 for different values of the applied force @xmath27 one gets the so - called _ velocity - force characteristic_. in cdw systems and josephson - junction arrays it corresponds to the current - voltage and voltage - current characteristics , respectively . in the context of friction",
    ", @xmath27 can be interpreted as the effective kinetic friction as a function of the sliding velocity @xmath26 .",

    "the first one can be obtained by taking the time average of the sum of ( [ int : eqm ] ) over all particles : @xmath29 this formula assumes that the average acceleration of the chain is zero .",
    "the other relationship can be derived from the fact that the energy released during sliding has to be dissipated totally , i.e. , @xmath30 using ( [ vf : v ] ) we get : @xmath31 .",
    "\\label{vf : fv2}\\ ] ] this result clearly shows that in the case of no dissipation ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) the chain may slide without any applied force . in section  [ inst ]",
    "we will discuss the condition of this possibility .",
    "( [ vf : fv2 ] ) also shows that the mobility @xmath33 is always less than or equal to @xmath34 , i.e. , the mobility in the limit @xmath35 .",
    "because of the symmetries of the equation of motion there exist nonstationary solutions called _ uniform sliding states_. they are characterized by the fact that every particle performs the same motion but shifted in time .",
    "that is , @xmath36 , for @xmath37 .",

    "it is more convenient to replace @xmath27 by ( [ us : fv1 ] ) or ( [ us : fv2 ] ) and solve ( [ us : ddeq ] ) for a given value of @xmath26 . from the solution",
    "@xmath42 one obtains the corresponding @xmath27 . in the overdamped limit ,",
    "it is well - known that @xmath27 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath26 @xcite . in the underdamped case _",
    "resonances _ lead to nonmonotonic velocity - force characteristics @xcite .",
    "we solve the hull - function equation ( [ us : ddeq ] ) numerically by expanding @xmath38 into a fourier series .",
    "the details are described in appendix  [ hull ] .",
    "figure  [ f.hull ] shows an example of a dynamic hull function .    in the underdamped case",
    "the numerically obtained velocity - force characteristics exhibits clearly peaks as can be seen in figure  [ f.vf ] .",
    "near these peaks an increase of the driving force @xmath27 by a considerable amount leads only to a slight increase of the average velocity @xmath26 .",
    "in other words , the differential mobility , @xmath48 , is much lower than the mobility without any periodic potential ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that the additional energy is only partially turned into a larger kinetic energy of the center of mass of the chain , whereas the main part is turned into oscillatory motion of the particle due to resonances .    in the frame of the center of mass which moves with average sliding velocity @xmath26",
    ", the external potential leads to a time - periodic force acting on the particle .",
    "the frequency of this force , the so - called `` washboard frequency '' , is given by the velocity of the center of mass divided by the period of the potential .",
    "resonance occurs if the washboard frequency is equal to the eigenfrequency of the phonon with wave number @xmath49 . to see this , we solve ( [ us : ddeq ] ) in the approximation @xmath50\\approx\\sin \\varphi$ ] .",
    "we get @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the phonon dispersion relation : @xmath53 in order to get the corresponding value of @xmath27 one can use either ( [ us : fv1 ] ) or ( [ us : fv2 ] ) .",
    "although both equations are equivalent , we get for the approximation ( [ res : f1 ] ) different results . evaluating ( [ us : fv1 ] ) leads to the obviously wrong result @xmath54 .",
    "this is can be understood from the fact that ( [ res : f1 ] ) is only the leading term of an expansion of the hull function in powers of @xmath55 .",
    "thus @xmath56 .",
    "instead of calculating the next order in @xmath38 one can use ( [ us : fv2 ] ) which leads to @xmath57 ^ 2+\\gamma^2v^2 }     + { \\cal o}(b^4)\\right ) .",
    "\\label{res : f1}\\ ] ] note that @xmath27 has to be an even function of @xmath55 because the external potential @xmath58 is an odd function of @xmath59 . for large values of @xmath26 , ( [ res : f1 ] ) approaches zero and therefore @xmath60 .",
    "that is , if the washboard slides very fast , the particles can not follow the fast pushing by the washboard .",
    "thus the chain slides like a rigid solid .",
    "we call this state the _ solid - sliding state_.    figure  [ f.vf ] shows that for large values of @xmath55 ( or small values of @xmath61 ) this simple approximation ( [ res : f1 ] ) overestimates the strength of the resonance line .",
    "that is , there is an effective damping , larger than @xmath61 , which increases with increasing oscillation amplitude .",
    "this larger damping can be understood by phonon coupling due to the nonlinearity in the equation of motion .",
    "this coupling opens up additional channels for energy dissipation yielding a higher effective damping constant .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ f.vf ] shows that a remarkably good approximation of these additional dissipation processes is given by the galerkin approximation @xmath62 .",
    "projecting the hull - function equation ( [ us : ddeq ] ) together with this ansatz onto @xmath63 and @xmath64 leads to two transcendental equations for @xmath65 and @xmath40 .",
    "after elimination of @xmath40 one can parameterize the velocity - force characteristic by the amplitude @xmath65 [ see eq .",
    "( [ hull : m1 ] ) in appendix  [ hull ] ] .    in order to understand the other resonance peaks seen in fig .",
    "[ f.vf ] one has to keep in mind that the external potential not only leads to a periodic driving force but also to a modulation of the eigenfrequencies .",
    "thus parametric processes make it possible to excite other phonons . in the framework of a perturbation theory with @xmath55 as the smallness parameter ,",
    "the elementary processes corresponding to these resonance lines are the decay of @xmath66 `` washboard waves '' ( wavenumber @xmath17 , frequency @xmath26 ) into a single phonon with wavenumber @xmath67 and frequency @xmath52 . assuming momentum and energy conservation one gets @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the _ superharmonic resonance _ frequency of order @xmath66 : @xmath71    the positions of the first few resonances are shown in fig .",
    "the agreement with the actual positions of the resonance peaks is quite good . near the superharmonic resonance of order @xmath66",
    "the @xmath66-th fourier mode of the hull function has a maximum .",
    "for example , the square in fig .",
    "[ f.vf ] corresponds to the hull function in fig .",
    "[ f.hull ] which is clearly dominated by @xmath72 .",
    "because of finite dissipation , superharmonic resonances of higher order may be hidden behind a nearby resonance of lesser order as , e.g. , the fourth resonance in fig .",
    "[ f.vf ] .",
    "the superharmonic resonance has been already investigated in the literature , experimentally @xcite as well as theoretically @xcite . the superharmonic resonance condition ( [ res : s.res ] )",
    "was observed first in numerical experiments by aubry and de  seze @xcite .",
    "they studied the fk model without damping but with a very small driving force .",
    "they found that the velocity of the center of mass did not increase linearly in time but it was locked for finite time intervals at velocities given by ( [ res : s.res ] ) .",
    "they also studied at the first time the underdamped and driven fk model @xcite .",
    "peyrard and kruskal found the same locking phenomenon for the velocity of a @xmath22-kink @xcite . in this case",

    "ustinov _ et al .",
    "_ as well as van der zant _",
    "_ explained the found resonances by the following mechanism which leads to ( [ res : s.res2 ] ) .",
    "the mechanism relies on the assumption that @xmath22-kinks are traveling in the ring .",
    "most of the time the particles are in a potential well . when a kink travels through a particle it jumps into the neighboring well and oscillates .",
    "because of the periodic boundary conditions the jumps occur in equidistant time steps .",
    "the distance between two kinks in terms of the number of particles inbetween is given by @xmath74 .",
    "the kink velocity @xmath2 is related to the average sliding velocity @xmath26 by @xmath75 .",
    "superharmonic resonances of order @xmath66 occur if the time interval between two jumps , i.e. , @xmath76 is @xmath66 times the oscillation time of the particles , i.e. , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 given by ( [ res : s.res2 ] ) is the dispersion relation of the linearized equation of motion ( [ int : eqm ] ) .",
    "the wavenumber @xmath67 times the distance @xmath79 has to be @xmath80 , that is , @xmath81 . according to this mechanism the superharmonic resonance condition is therefore ( [ res : s.res2 ] ) .",
    "this picture is valid only if the distance between two kinks , i.e. , @xmath74 , is much larger than one .",
    "that is , the motion can be described by kinks only if @xmath21 is near an integer value .",
    "thus , we expect that ( [ res : s.res ] ) is valid for @xmath82 and ( [ res : s.res2 ] ) for @xmath83 .",

    "they are governed by the equation of motion ( [ int : eqm ] ) linearized around ( [ us : dhull ] ) : @xmath86     \\delta x_j .",

    "one can write any solution of this equation as a sum of solutions of the form @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a @xmath22-periodic function and @xmath90 is the so - called floquet exponent .",
    "the uniform sliding state is stable if the real part of @xmath90 is negative for all values of @xmath67 .",
    "there is always a solution with @xmath91 .",
    "it is the goldstone mode @xmath92 , which follows directly from differentiating ( [ us : ddeq ] ) .",
    "appendix  [ linst ] describes the scheme we have used to solve ( [ inst : leqm ] ) with the floquet - bloch ansatz ( [ inst : f.sol ] ) numerically .",
    "the dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ f.vf ] denote unstable parts of the velocity - force characteristics .",
    "two different mechanisms may lead to an instability of the uniform sliding state .",
    "the first one is _ negative differential mobility _ , i.e. , a negative slope in the velocity - force characteristic .",
    "a small positive velocity fluctuation @xmath93 accelerates the chain because the applied force is larger than the force necessary to keep the new velocity @xmath94 constant .",
    "the second type of instabilities is caused by _",
    "parametric resonance_. in the framework of multi - phonon process it corresponds to the decay of @xmath66 washboard waves into two phonons with wavenumber @xmath95 .",
    "parametric resonance of order @xmath66 can be expected for values of the average sliding velocity @xmath26 which are given by @xmath96 because parametric resonance is a threshold phenomenon , the amplitude @xmath55 of the washboard wave has to exceed a critical value which is proportional to @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "this is true only for values of @xmath26 between the minimum and the maximum of ( [ inst : p.res ] ) . for velocities outside",
    "this interval parametric resonance is still possible but the threshold increases . for zero damping",
    "the uniform sliding state is unstable for any value of @xmath26 below a certain critical value @xmath98 which is approximately calculated in appendix  [ linst ] : @xmath99 the actual value of @xmath98 obtained from the numerical stability analysis agrees very well with this formula even for large values of @xmath55 .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath98 is less than ( [ inst : vc ] ) but deviates not more than 10 percent for @xmath100 .",
    "near resonance peaks the system is bistable and has therefore the opportunity to organizes itself into _ domains _ of different uniform sliding states .",
    "figure  [ f.mdom ] shows a typical example with ten domains .",
    "there are only two types of domains .",
    "each domain is characterized by uniform sliding .",
    "that is , in each domain the particle motion is given by ( [ us : dhull ] ) but the hull function @xmath38 and the value of @xmath17 and @xmath26 are different in each domain .",
    "one can say that the domains are characterized by different particle densities @xmath15 .",
    "neighboring domains are separated by domain walls ( fronts ) of finite size .",
    "conservation of the number of particles implies that a front has to move with the velocity @xmath101 where the average particle distance and the average particle velocity of each domain type is given by @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively . from the viewpoint of the particles",
    ", we can express the front velocity in terms of how fast the front travels from one particle to the next .",
    "it is given by @xmath104 because ( [ sd : vdw ] ) and ( [ sd : c ] ) are symmetric in the exchange of the indices , all fronts propagate with the same velocity leaving the widths of the domains constant . the numbers @xmath105 of particles in each type of domain fulfill the following constraints : @xmath106 because of @xmath107 the particle density for one type of the domains is larger than @xmath15 whereas for the other type it is less than @xmath15 . in the following the type with the larger density will be number one .",
    "thus , @xmath108 the average sliding velocity @xmath26 of a domain state is given by @xmath109    a domain - type state is in general a quasiperiodic motion with three frequencies : @xmath110 and @xmath111 from the periodic motion in each domain type and @xmath112 from the cyclic motion of the fronts through the system .",
    "to understand this kind of pattern formation we investigate in detail two - domain states .",
    "first , we have to discuss the relationship between the average sliding velocity @xmath26 and the average particle distance @xmath17 for the uniform sliding state at a fixed value of @xmath27 , i.e. , the _ velocity - distance characteristic_. a typical example is shown in figure  [ f.va](a ) . as in the velocity - force characteristic , resonances are responsible for folds .",
    "a two - domain state is completely characterized by two points on the stable branches of the velocity - distance characteristic which fulfill ( [ sd : a ] ) .",
    "the velocity @xmath2 of the front is the slope of the line connecting both points ( see fig .",
    "[ f.cg ] ) .",
    "the sizes of the domains are determined by the solutions of ( [ sd : n12 ] ) .",
    "from this consideration one would expect a continuous family of two - domain states parameterized by two real numbers .",
    "but this is not the case , as figure  [ f.td.relax ] clearly shows . in our numerical simulations we always found that the system selects dynamically the same pair of points on the velocity - distance characteristic",
    "this is true even if @xmath17 is changed as long as @xmath113 . how does the system selects a certain pair of values for @xmath102 ?",
    "a careful inspection of fig .",
    "[ f.td.relax ] reveals that behind the fronts new domain states are selected .",
    "these states are independent of the initial states .",
    "the interface between the new domain state and the old one does not form a front .",
    "it smears out and in the long - time limit the domain states approach to uniform densities with well - defined values of @xmath17 .",
    "numerical experiments show that the state @xmath114 behind the front is uniquely defined by the state @xmath115 in front of the front [ see fig .",
    "[ f.va](b ) ] .",
    "hence there is functional relation between them : @xmath116 together with ( [ sd : c ] ) we have a uniquely defined relation between @xmath2 , @xmath115 , and @xmath114 .",
    "this behavior fits into the general picture of front propagation in bistable systems @xcite ( see also sec .  [ qcd ] ) . if we know the function @xmath65 we can calculate the values of @xmath117 and @xmath118 by solving @xmath119 [ see also fig .",
    "[ f.va](b ) ] . note that the values of @xmath117 and @xmath118 are in general irrational @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath17 determines only the sizes of the domains",
    ". whether the chain is commensurate or incommensurate is irrelevant .",
    "but numerically we have never found such states for values of @xmath17 near integer multiples of @xmath22 .",
    "the selected values of @xmath117 and @xmath118 are of course functions of the applied force @xmath27 .",
    "figure  [ f.vf.td ] shows the velocity - force characteristic of the two - domain states . by varying @xmath27",
    "they disappear because of two reasons .",
    "first , one of the domains shrinks to zero and the velocity - force characteristics of the two - domain state and uniform sliding state come together .",
    "secondly , @xmath117 or @xmath118 may move onto an unstable branch of the velocity - distance characteristic .",
    "thus , the two - domain state still exists but it has become unstable . in fig .",
    "[ f.vf.td ] the velocity - force characteristic of this unstable two - domain state is denoted schematically by dotted extensions .",
    "we have seen that the state of the domains can be described by ( [ us : dhull ] ) .",
    "they are characterized by @xmath102 and @xmath103 . to describe the fronts in the same way we assume that @xmath17 and @xmath26 are continuous functions which are varying slowly in space and time .",
    "the space coordinate is the particle index @xmath120 .",

    "if the requirements on @xmath137 and @xmath2 are fulfilled , the nonlinear term @xmath138 in ( [ qcd : wall.a ] ) will have three nodes and will be n - shaped ( see fig .  [ f.cg ] ) .",
    "a front solution is a heteroclinic orbit of ( [ qcd : wall.a ] ) which goes from @xmath117 to @xmath118 or vice versa .",
    "thus , we are looking for solutions with boundary conditions @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "a heteroclinic orbit occurs only if the unstable manifold of the fixed point @xmath102 is the stable manifold of @xmath141 .",
    "this is possible only on a one - dimensional manifold in the parameter space of @xmath137 and @xmath2 .",
    "thus ( [ tds : a ] ) is justified .    to calculate the stable and unstable manifolds we linearize ( [ qcd : wall.a ] ) around the fixed points @xmath102 . for the perturbation",
    "@xmath142 we make the ansatz @xmath143 which leads to the characteristic polynomial @xmath144 because of @xmath145 ( see fig .  [ f.cg ] )",
    "there is one negative root @xmath146 . if @xmath147 the two other solutions are conjugated complex with a real part that is just @xmath148 .",
    "numerically we always found subsonic front motion ( i.e. , @xmath149 ) leading to an unstable manifold that spirals out of the fixed point .",
    "thus , the precursor of the front is non - oscillatory whereas its tail is oscillatory because the particles have inertia and therefore respond with an exponentially decreasing oscillation after an acceleration or deacceleration .    in order to verify this qualitative picture",
    "numerically one has to extract @xmath17 and @xmath26 from the data . in principle",
    "this could be done by local fits of the dynamic hull function from which we obtain @xmath150 and subsequently @xmath17 and @xmath26 .",
    "but this is a very tedious way which is not necessary because we are only interested in the qualitative form of the shape of the front .",
    "the following simple method is sufficient for this task . for uniform sliding states it leads to values of @xmath17 and @xmath26 which are identical with the exact ones .",
    "we introduce for each particle a sequence of times @xmath151 defined by @xmath152 and @xmath153 . from these sequences",
    "we get the following approximations of @xmath26 and @xmath17 : @xmath154 where @xmath66 and @xmath0 are chosen in such a way that ( i ) @xmath155 and ( ii ) @xmath156 is the time closest to @xmath151 , i.e. , @xmath157 .    for a fixed value of @xmath125 one",
    "gets a snapshot of @xmath26 and @xmath17 .",
    "the superposition of many snapshots shifted by @xmath158 gives the impression of a smooth curve ( see fig .",
    "[ f.qcd ] ) .",
    "we have tuned @xmath2 until the curves are as smooth as possible .",
    "it turned out that this method is a very accurate way to measure the front velocity @xmath2 .",
    "the precursors and tails of both fronts are non - oscillating and oscillating , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the oscillatory tail of the front on the left decays roughly two times slower than the precursor of the front on the right .",
    "both observations are in full agreement with our analytical reasoning above .",
    "starting from an arbitrary initial condition one gets either a uniform sliding state ( if a stable one exists ) or a multi - domain state but only rarely a two - domain state .",
    "this is especially true for large systems .",
    "it is a very general behavior of bistable spatially extended systems , at least for the initial phase of the dynamics .",
    "different parts of the system establish themselves independently into one of the bistable states .",
    "it is therefore natural that several domains occur .",
    "after the initial formation of a multi - domain state , domains may shrink and eventually disappear on a slow time scale .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that an attractive force between the fronts exist @xcite .",
    "this force is caused by the overlap of the precursor and the tail of the neighboring fronts .",
    "it can be calculated by singular perturbation theory @xcite . in the case of non - oscillating precursors and tails",
    "the force decreases exponentially with distance @xcite . in our case where the tail is oscillating",
    ", the resulting force is also oscillating @xcite",
    ". therefore equilibrium positions are possible where a pair of two fronts form a bound molecule .",
    "the available distances between the fronts are quantized .",
    "figure  [ f.mds ] shows an example where this quantization is clearly seen . in accordance with shilnikov s theorem",
    "such molecules are possible only if the oscillatory tail decays slower than the nonoscillatory one @xcite which is indeed the case ( see sec .  [ qcd ] ) . as a consequence the system shows spatial chaos .    for values of @xmath27 near",
    "higher order resonances the velocity - distance characteristic of the uniform sliding state shows several resonance folds .",
    "thus , multi - domain states are possible which are built up from more than two different domain types .",
    "all our numerical experiments have shown that no matter how many domain types occur in the transient , at the end ( i.e. , in the long - time limit ) only two or three domain types survive .",
    "furthermore , all fronts travel with the same velocity @xmath2 .",
    "there is a simple argument why more than three domain types are inconsistent with the last fact .",
    "consider the case of four different domain types with @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "between two consecutive values @xmath115 and @xmath161 there should be no additional stable state and only one unstable state .",
    "thus , if two of such domain types are neighbors the states are functionally related in accordance with ( [ tds : a ] ) .",
    "let us assume a sequence of domains from right ( domain type 1 ) to left ( domain type 4 ) . using ( [ tds : a ] )",
    "we get @xmath162 .",
    "this sequence is therefore uniquely determined by @xmath117 .",
    "now the condition that all fronts have the same speed can not be fulfilled because there is only one free variable but ( at least ) two conditions , namely , @xmath163 .",
    "thus , four different domain types are in contradiction with the observation concerning the front velocities",
    ".    for @xmath164 domain - like solutions occur where in one domain state the particles sit in potential wells ( average particle distance @xmath17 is an integer multiple of @xmath22 , e.g. , @xmath165 ) and do not move .",
    "such so - called traffic - jam solutions have been already reported by braun _",
    "they mainly occur near integer values of @xmath21 where the domain - like states discussed in this section are not possible .",
    "in this paper the regular sliding states ( periodic and quasi - periodic solutions ) of the fk model are investigated for large chains ( @xmath24 ) and for values of @xmath61 , @xmath55 , and @xmath27 where all forces in the equation of motion ( [ int : eqm ] ) are of the same order .    instead of classifying these attractors to be either periodic or quasiperiodic ,",
    "a more informative distinction is whether their locally average particle density is uniform or not . in a periodic state",
    "the density is uniform because all particles perform the same motion only shifted in time .",
    "the motion of the whole chain is completely determined by a single periodic function , the dynamical hull function .",
    "the velocity - force characteristics of the periodic attractors show peaks at certain values of the velocity .",
    "these peaks are caused by resonances of the `` washboard '' wave . in the frame of the center of mass of the chain",
    "the external potential can be seen as a wave ( washboard wave ) with wave number @xmath17 ( which is the inverse average particle density ) and frequency @xmath26 ( which is the average sliding velocity ) .",
    "resonances occur for those values of @xmath26 where @xmath66 washboard waves are able to decay into a phonon [ wavenumber @xmath67 , frequency @xmath52 ] in accordance with `` momentum '' and `` energy '' conservation [ i.e. , @xmath68 and @xmath167 .",
    "a similar process with a decay into two phonons ( parametric resonance ) explains why the uniform sliding state may be unstable even though the differential mobility is positive .",
    "quasiperiodic states emerge from instabilities of uniform sliding states .",
    "they are characterized by domains of different average particle densities . in each domain",
    "the average particle velocity is uniform and _ nonzero_. the walls between neighboring domains move all with the same velocity .",
    "this domain - wall or front velocity is different from the velocity of the center of mass .",
    "thus , each particle goes through all domains . in a quasiperiodic attractor",
    "not more than three different domain types are possible . for chains close to the most commensurate case ( i.e.",
    ", @xmath17 is an integer multiple of @xmath22 ) the average particle velocity is zero in one domain . in this so - called traffic - jam state",
    "@xcite the particles are alternately switch between stationarity and sliding .",
    "because the traffic - jam state exists also for finite temperatures @xcite states with different sliding domains will presumably survive finite temperatures .    in this paper",
    "we have developed a quasi - continuum description of the fk model on the basis of slowly varying locally averaged inverse density @xmath17 and velocity @xmath26 .",
    "that is , @xmath17 and @xmath26 slowly depend on the particle index @xmath120 and the time @xmath125 .",
    "a set of partial differential equations [ eqs .",
    "( [ qcd : eqm ] ) ] governs the dynamics of the variables ( assuming @xmath120 to be a continuous space variable ) .",
    "it is not possible to solve these partial differential equations analytically .",
    "but it is quite helpful to understand ( i ) why the fk model organizes itself into domain - like states with domain states which are not determined from outside , ( ii ) why there are not more than three different domain types , ( iii ) why the size of the domains is quantized , ( iv ) why states with several domains of the same type are possible , ( v ) why a multi - domain state can be seen as an example of spatial chaos , and ( vi ) why for a fixed value of the external force @xmath27 the number of stable states increases exponentially with @xmath13 .",
    "the huge number of stable states leads to multi - hysteretic behavior like in a ferromagnet where the position in the velocity - force characteristic strongly depends on the history .",
    "the phenomenon of domain - like states where each domain is characterized by a spatially periodic but stationary solution has already been found in hydrodynamical pattern formation ( taylor - couette system @xcite and rayleigh - bnard system @xcite ) . theoretically this behavior has been modeled by nonlinear phase equations @xcite . in our case",
    "the domain states are periodic in space and time , they are traveling waves .    in experiments where locally resolved measurements are not possible , the most important consequence of the domain - like sliding states are ( i ) quasiperiodicity in the time signals like the velocity of the center of mass , ( ii ) flattening of the resonance peaks ( see fig .  [ f.vf.td ] ) , and ( iii ) multihysteretic behavior",
    ". many of these features should disappear for small values of @xmath13 if they are caused by domain - like states . because the inertia term is important for these states",
    ", we do not expect it in cdw - systems . in adsorbate layers and ionic conductors",
    "the appearance of them should be possible but it may be difficult to drive them _ uniformly _ and to measure the velocity - force characteristic . the ideal system to check our theory are josephson - junction arrays because the force and the velocity correspond to the driving current and the voltage , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the damping constant @xmath61 and the number of junctions @xmath13 can be chosen by the fabrication process .",
    "the average distance @xmath168 is also easily accessible because the number @xmath14 of flux quanta can be chosen by the initial preparation of the system .",
    "thus , for rings of more than 50 josephson junctions we predict the occurrence of domain - like sliding states .",

    "this work was supported by the swiss national science foundation .",
    "in this appendix we describe the numerical scheme we have used to solve the differential delay equation ( [ us : ddeq ] ) for the dynamic hull function @xmath42 . in the simplest case",

    "now we are able to calculate @xmath176 from @xmath177 by two fast fourier transformations ( fft ) .",

    "the second fft yields @xmath176 .    in order to get reliable results the value of the cutoff @xmath14 has to be chosen carefully .",
    "due to the fft the hull function is approximated on a lattice with lattice constant @xmath178 . because of ( [ us : dhull ] ) this corresponds to a time resolution @xmath179 of @xmath180 .",
    "the fastest time scale in the system is given by @xmath22 divided by the maximum phonon frequency which is 2 in accordance with ( [ res : w ] ) .",
    "assuming that the fastest time scale has to be resolved at least by two steps @xmath181 we get reliable results only if @xmath182 all results reported in this paper are obtained for @xmath183 .",
