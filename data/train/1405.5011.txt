    "the solution of ( fde ) exists and is unique under the hypothesis that @xmath7 is continuous and fulfils a lipschitz condition with respect to the second variable ( see e.g. @xcite for a proof ) .    as for the integer order case @xmath8 ,",
    "a classical approach for solving ( [ fde ] ) is based on the discretization of the fractional derivative ( cd ) , which generalizes the well known grunwald - letnikov discretization ( see @xcite ) , leading to the so - called fractional backward differentiation formulas ( fbdfs ) introduced in @xcite .",
    "taking a uniform mesh @xmath9 of the time domain with stepsize @xmath10 fbdfs are based on the full - term recursion@xmath11where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the taylor coefficients of the generating function@xmath14being @xmath15 the coefficients of the underlying bdf . in @xcite",
    "it is also shown that the order @xmath16 of the bdf is preserved .",
    "we remember that for this kind of equations , there is generally an intrinsic lack of regularity of the solution in a neighborhood of the starting point , that is , depending on the function @xmath7 , one may have @xmath17 as @xmath18 .",

    "starting from the initial data @xmath6 , the first @xmath29 approximations @xmath30 can be generated by the underlying fbdfs or even considering lower degree rational approximations .    a formula of type ( [ ks ] ) generalizes in some sense the methods based on the short memory principle in which the truncated taylor expansion of ( genf ) is considered ( see @xcite for some examples ) .",
    "computationally , the advantages are noticeable , especially in terms of memory saving whenever ( [ fde ] ) arises from the semi - discretization of fractional partial differential equations .",
    "we remark moreover that since the initial approximations are used only at the beginning of the process , there is no need to use a starting term to preserve the theoretical order as for standard full - recursion multistep formulas .",
    "moreover , as remarked in dffw , in particular when @xmath31 , the use of a starting formula as in ( [ fbdfc ] ) , that theoretically should ensure the order of the fbdf , in practice may introduce substantial errors , causing unreliable numerical solutions . for high - order formulas ,",
