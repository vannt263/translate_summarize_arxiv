    "the existence of an event horizon is one of the most characteristic concepts of general relativity .",

    "simple situations arise in general stationary spacetime , for which it can be shown that any event horizon must have a spherical topology@xcite@xcite .",
    "the first work dealing with the topology of non - stationary black holes is due to gannon@xcite . with the physically reasonable condition of asymptotic flatness",
    ", it was proved that the topology of a smooth event horizon must be either a sphere or a torus ( when the dominant energy condition is satisfied ) .",
    "such an approach has recently been extended and generalized to give stronger theorems , with the assumptions of asymptotic flatness , global hyperbolicity , and a suitable energy condition .",
    "friedmann , schleich , and witt proved the `` topological censorship '' theorem that any two causal curves extending from past to the future null infinity is homotopy equivalent to each other@xcite .",
    "jacobson and venkataramani@xcite have established a theorem that strengthens a recent result due to browdy and galloway that the topology of an event horizon with a timeslicing is a sphere if no new null generators enter the horizon at later times@xcite .",
    "the theorem of jacobson and venkataramani limits the time for which a torus event horizon can persist .",
    "most of these works are based on the differentiability of the event horizon .",
    "considering the whole structures of the event horizon , however , the event horizon can not always be differentiable .",
    "for example , even in the case of spherically symmetric spacetime ( for example , oppenheimer - snyder spacetime ) the event horizon is not differentiable where the event horizon is formed . in general ,",
    "if the event horizon is not smooth , we can not say that the event horizon should be a sphere .",
    "in fact , the existence of the event horizon whose topology is not a single @xmath1 is reported in the numerical simulations of gravitational collapses .",
    "shapiro , teukolsky et .",
    "al.@xcite numerically observed a torus event horizon in the collapse of a toroidal matter .",

    "for , as shown in the present article , an event horizon is not differentiable at the endpoint of the null geodesic generating the event horizon . in the present article , such an indifferentiability at the endpoint is mainly handled .",
    "on the contrary , we do not care about the indifferentiability not related to the endpoint ( for example , the indifferentiability caused by the pathological structure of the null infinity@xcite ) .    in a physically realistic gravitational collapse",
    ", it is believed that a spacetime is quasi - stationary far in the future .",
    "so , it may be natural to assume that the topology of an event horizon should be a sphere for a single asymptotic region .",
    "then the problem of the topology of the event horizon is regarded as a topology changing process from a non - spherical surface to a sphere in a three - dimensional manifold ( the event horizon ) .",
    "therefore we will put the theories of the topology change@xcite@xcite into this problem .    in the next section ,",
    "we prepare the theories of the topology change of a spacetime , which is applied to the event horizon in the section 3 .",

    "the mapping degree of this map is called the index of @xmath6 at the zero @xmath12 .",

    "we call them the endpoints of the eh . to generate the eh the null geodesics @xmath59 are maximally extended to the future and past as long as they belong to the eh .",

    ", we also consider dull cases provided by a certain timeslicing .",
    "when the edge of the soep is hit by the timeslicing from the future , according to the construction above , it gives a zero with its index being zero ( fig.[fig : ends](c ) ) and there is no topology change of the eh .",
    "@xmath54    this result is partially suggested in shapiro , teukolsky , and winicour@xcite .",
    "* remark : *  one may face special situations . the possibilities of the branching endpoints should be noticed .",
    "if the soep possesses a branching point , a special timeslicing can make the branching point into an isolated zero though such a timeslicing loses this aspect under the small deformation of the timeslicing .",
    "the index of this branching endpoint may deny a direct consideration .",
    "the situation , however , is regarded as the degeneration of the two distinguished zeros of @xmath132 in @xmath123 .",
    "some of examples are displayed in fig.[fig : branches ] .",
    "imagine a little slanted timeslicing , and it will decompose the branching point into two distinguished ( of course , there are the possibilities of the degeneration of three or more ) zeros .",
    "the first case is the branch of the one - dimensional soep ( fig.[fig : branches](a ) ) , where the branching point is the degeneration of two zeros of @xmath132 with their index being a minus one , since they are the results of the one - dimensional soep .",
    "then the index of the branching point is a minus two and , for example , three spheres coalesce there .",
    "the next case is a one - dimensional branch from the two - dimensional soep ( fig.[fig : branches](b ) ) .",
    "this branching point is the degeneration of the zeros of @xmath132 from the one - dimensional soep ( index @xmath137 ) and the two - dimensional soep ( index @xmath138 ) .",
    "this decomposition tells that though the index of this point vanishes , the toeh changes at this point , for example , from a sphere and a torus to a sphere .",
    "of course , the euler number does not change in this process .",
    "furthermore , these topology changing processes are stable under the small deformation of the timeslicing .",
    "finally , there is the case in which a timeslicing is partially tangent to the soep or its boundary .",
    "for instance , an accidental timeslicing can hit not a single point of the soep but a line of the soep from the future as shown in fig.[fig : branches](c ) .",
    "for such a timeslicing , the contribution of the two - dimensional soep to the index is not a minus one but one .",
    "this situation , however , is unstable under the small deformation of the timeslicing , and we omit such a case in the following .",
    "incidentally , a certain timeslicing gives the further changes of the euler number .",
    "[ cl1 ] the topology changing processes of an eh from @xmath140 to @xmath1 , ( @xmath141 ) can change each other , and from a surface with genus=@xmath3 to @xmath1 , ( @xmath141 ) can also change , under the appropriate deformation of their timeslicing .",
    "* proof : *  from the theorem [ t2 ] , when the toeh changes from @xmath142 to a single @xmath1 in a timeslicing , there should be the one - dimensional soep ( in which there may be some branches ) .",
    "since the soep is a spacelike set ( the proposition [ p2 ] ) , there is another appropriate timeslicing hitting the soep at @xmath143 different points simultaneously ( fig.[fig : multi](a ) ) . on this timeslicing",
    ", the euler number changes by @xmath144 and @xmath143@xmath145@xmath146 spheres coalesce . in the same logic ,",
    "the eh of a surface with genus=@xmath3 can be regarded as the eh of a surface with genus=@xmath143 by the appropriate change of its timeslicing ( see fig.[fig : multi](b ) ) .",
    "@xmath54    as shown in the corollary [ cl1 ] , the toeh highly depends on the timeslicing .",
    "nevertheless , the theorem [ t2 ] tells that there is the distinct difference between the coalescence of @xmath3 spheres where the euler number decreases by the one - dimensional soep and the eh of a surface with genus=@xmath3 where the euler number increases by the two - dimensional soep .",
    "finally we see that , in a sense , the toeh is a transient term .",
    "all the changes of the toeh are reduced to the trivial creation of an eh which is topologically @xmath1 .",
    "* proof : *  from the proposition [ p2 ] , the collared soep is topologically @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , since the soep is spacelike , there is a certain timeslicing in which @xmath147 is most in the past on the soep and the more distant from @xmath147 , the more in the future . in this timeslicing",
    ", @xmath123 has only one significant zero @xmath147 of @xmath132 ( type 1 in fig.[fig : zeros](b ) ) , which corresponds to the point where the eh is formed and meaningless zeros ( with the index 0 , for example , see fig.[fig : ends](c ) ) on the edge of the soep .",
    "the index of @xmath147 is + 1 , and a spherical eh are formed there .",
    "@xmath54    thus we see that the change of the toeh is determined by the topology of the soep and the timeslicing way of it . for example",
    ", we can imagine the graph of the soep as fig.[fig : graph ] . to determine the toeh we must only give the order to each vertex of the graph by a timeslicing .",
    "the graph in fig.[fig : graph ] might be rather complex .",
    "nevertheless , considering a small scale inhomogeneity , for example the scale of a single particle , the eh may admit such a complex soep .",
    "it will be smoothed out in macroscopic physics .",
    "we have studied the topology of the eh ( toeh ) , partially considering the indifferentiability of the eh .",
    "we have found that the coalescence of ehs is related to the one - dimensional past endpoints and a torus eh two - dimensional . in a sense , this is the generalization of the result of shapiro , teukolsky , and winicour@xcite .",
    "furthermore these changes of the toeh can be removed by an appropriate timeslicing since the set of the endpoints ( soep ) is a connected spacelike set .",
    "we see that the toeh strongly depends on the timeslicing .",
    "the dimensions of the soep , however , play an important role for the toeh and , of course , are invariant under the change of the timeslicing .    based on these results , it arises the question what controls the dimensions of the soep",
    ". one may expect that something like an energy condition restricts the possibilities of the soep .",
    "nevertheless it is doubtful since , in fact , two cases with the non - trivial toeh ( the coalescence of ehs  the one - dimensional soep and a torus eh  the two - dimensional soep ) , where the energy condition is satisfied , are reported in the numerical simulations @xcite@xcite .",
    "are these generic in real gravitational collapses ?",
    "it is probable that the gravitational collapse in which the eh is a single sphere for each timeslicing is not generic , since the zero - dimensional soep reflects the higher symmetry of a system than that of the one- or two - dimensional soep . on balance ,",
    "the symmetry of matter configurations will control it .",
    "for example , it is possible to discuss the stability and generality of such a symmetry .",
    "we will show the stability of a spherical eh under linear perturbations and the catastrophic structure of the soep@xcite .",
    "these discussions would tell something about how the structure of the soep is determined dynamically .",
    "in the present article , we have assumed some conditions about the structure of spacetime .",
    "can other weaker conditions take the place of them ?",
    "first , the strongly causal condition may be too strong . for",
    ", this condition is needed only on the eh .",
    "for example , the global hyperbolicity implies the strong causality on the eh , because the global hyperbolicity exclude a closed causal curve and a past imprisoned causal curve and there should be no future imprisoned null curve on the eh .",
    "next , we required that the toeh is smooth @xmath1 far in the future .",
    "this , however , is not crucial .",
    "since the present investigation is based on the topology change theory , the same discussion is possible for other final toehs .",
    "next , the @xmath27-differentiability of the eh is supposed except on the compact soep while it might be able to be violated in realistic situations .",
    "it is not clear whether this differentiability can be implied by other physically reasonable conditions .",
    "the indifferentiability , however , is overwhelmingly easier to occur on the endpoint than not on the endpoint .",
    "every non - eternal eh possesses such an indifferentiable point as a past endpoint and we do not have any simple example where the indifferentiable point is not the endpoint . on the other hand , the case in which the eh is not indifferentiable only on compact subsets ( i.e. , the soep is not compact ) would be excluded by the realistic requirement about the asymptotic structure of the spacetime , as a nowhere differentiable spacetime@xcite is excluded by asymptotic flatness .",
    "it would be worth to clarify such properties about the differentiability of the eh .",
    "incidentally , some of the statements in this article may overlap the result of the former works@xcite@xmath148@xcite .",
    "nevertheless the condition required here is pretty different from that of them ( for example , the energy condition have never been assumed here ) .",
    "they might be the extension of the former work .",
    "finally we are reminded of an essential question .",
    "how can we see the topology of the eh ? some of the former works , for example `` topological censorship''@xcite , oppose . on the contrary",
    ", we expect the phenomena highly depending on the existence of the eh as the boundary condition of fields , for instance the quasi - normal mode of gravitational wave@xcite or hawking radiation@xcite , reflect the toeh .",
    "this is our future problem .",
