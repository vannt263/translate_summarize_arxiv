    "the origin of this restricted appearance of the mandelstam cut contribution @xmath104 can be traced back to mandelstam s argument for the existence of the regge cuts ( fig .",

    "it is believed that the full mhv amplitude in the planar ( large-@xmath1 ) approximation can be written in the factorized form : m_2 4 = m^bds_2 4r _ 24 .",
    "indeed , in  @xcite it was shown that in the region @xmath101 the correct form of the lla @xmath103 scattering amplitude is m^lla_24=m^bds_24(1+i^lla _ 24 ) , [ corllajb ] where @xmath115 is the bds amplitude  @xcite and ^lla _ 24= _ n=-^(-1)^n _ -^ ( ) ^i- ( ) ^i+ ( s_2^ ( , n)-1 ) .",

    "we will give a more detailed discussion : in particular , it will be shown that this hamiltonian is integrable and belongs to an open spin chain .",

    "<S> in this review we show that the multi - particle scattering amplitudes in @xmath0 sym at large @xmath1 and in the multi - regge kinematics for some physical regions have the high energy behavior appearing from the contribution of the mandelstam cuts in the complex angular momentum plane of the corresponding @xmath2-channel partial waves . </S>",
    "<S> these mandelstam cuts or regge cuts are resulting from gluon composite states in the adjoint representation of the gauge group @xmath3 . in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) </S>",
    "<S> their contribution to the six point amplitude is in full agreement with the known two - loop result . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian for the mandelstam states constructed from @xmath4 gluons in lla coincides with the local hamiltonian of an integrable open spin chain . </S>",
    "<S> we construct the corresponding wave functions using the integrals of motion and the baxter - sklyanin approach .    </S>",
