    "several years ago stillinger and helfand@xcite introduced a simple but nontrivial model of fluid demixing .",
    "their original model consists of a binary mixture of @xmath1 and @xmath2 particles .",
    "particles of the same type do not interact with one another , but @xmath1 and @xmath2 particles interact with a repulsive potential such that the mayer @xmath3-function is a gaussian .",
    "this choice for the @xmath4 potential , known as the gaussian molecule potential , greatly simplifies the calculation of virial coefficients and most work for this potential has been done using series methods@xcite .",
    "the main motivation for this work is to confirm ising universality for the critical exponents of continuum systems .    in this paper",
    "we study the  model and some of its generalizations using cluster monte carlo methods . where possible",
    ", we compare our results to the series analyses and to results for the ising - potts universality classes . although the gaussian molecule potential yields a more tractable virial expansion , it is easier to implement a cluster algorithm for the repulsive step potential .",
    "we also consider a generalization of the  model to @xmath0 species ( components ) , such that particles of the same species do not interact but particles of different species interact with a repulsive potential .",
    "we expect that this generalization will be in the same universality class as the @xmath0-state potts model for @xmath0 not too large and another motivation for this study is to confirm this correspondence . for example",
    ", we know that the two - dimensional ( 2d ) potts model for @xmath5 has a first - order transition . does the @xmath0-component 2d  model also have a first - order transition for @xmath5 ?",
    "in addition , we consider the effect of quenched disorder by randomly adding fixed scattering centers .",
    "there are general arguments@xcite that quenched disorder causes first - order transitions to become continuous .",
    "these arguments hold rigorously for 2d potts models@xcite , but have not been studied for continuum models .    in previous work@xcite cluster monte carlo methods",
    "were applied to the widom - rowlinson model@xcite .",
    "the widom - rowlinson and  models are closely related , the only difference is that the widom - rowlinson model has a hard - core interaction between different species . in this paper , the invaded cluster monte carlo method introduced in ref.@xcite",
    "is extended to soft - core repulsive potentials and is used to find the phase transition point for a given temperature without prior knowledge of the critical fugacity .",
    "the invaded cluster method has almost no critical slowing for the widom - rowlinson model , and we find that similar results hold for the  models studied here .",
    "we consider @xmath0-component ( @xmath6 ) fluids in @xmath7 dimensions with @xmath8 .",
    "the components ( species ) have no self - interaction but particles of one species interact with particles of all other species via an isotropic repulsive potential , @xmath9 .",
    "we consider two choices for @xmath9 ,    [ eqn : allpots ] @xmath10 @xmath11    the limit @xmath12 for the step potential corresponds to the widom - rowlinson model .",
    "for the gaussian molecule potential , the temperature @xmath13 plays no role because the boltzmann factor , @xmath14 is , by design , independent of @xmath13 .",
    "in general , each component of the @xmath0-component fluid may have a distinct fugacity ; however symmetry considerations dictate that a demixing transition occurs with all fugacities equal , and hence we set all the fugacities equal to a single value , @xmath15 .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath15 , the @xmath0 species are mixed , while for large @xmath15 , there are @xmath0 distinct phases because different species repel one another , with each phase predominately composed of one species . if @xmath0 is not too large ,",
    "there is expected to be a single demixing transition separating these regimes that is in the same universality class as the @xmath0-state potts model .    for very large @xmath0 , the correspondence between potts models and widom - rowlinson models must break down .",
    "although potts models have a single ordering transition , widom - rowlinson models can be presumed to have an intermediate crystalline phase for @xmath16 and large @xmath0 . to understand this phase , consider the limits @xmath17 and @xmath18 , with the product @xmath19 order unity .",
    "then non - overlapping particles appear with an effective fugacity of @xmath20 .",
    "however when two particles overlap , the cost is an additional factor of @xmath21 because the overlapping particles must be of the same species .",
    "hence the limiting model is precisely the hard sphere gas which we presume has a crystalline phase in @xmath16@xcite .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that such a phase occurs in the widom - rowlinson models for large @xmath0 and @xmath15 of order @xmath22 .",
    "needless to say , for fixed @xmath0 , when the fugacity is sufficiently large , the model will demix , and thus the crystalline phase is an intermediate phase .",
    "we also expect an intermediate crystalline phase for large @xmath0 soft - core  models based on a mapping to a single component fluid with a repulsive soft - core potential .",
    "for example , the gaussian core model@xcite is known to crystallize in @xmath23 .",
    "although intermediate phases do not occur for the usual potts models , they are not a consequence of the continuum ; indeed such phases are known to occur on the lattice for the site - dilute ( annealed ) potts models@xcite as well as for the lattice version of the widom - rowlinson model@xcite .",
    "the algorithms used here are , broadly speaking , examples of cluster algorithms of the type first introduced by swendsen and wang@xcite .",
    "cluster algorithms have been found to be much more efficient than local algorithms such as the metropolis algorithm for simulating spin systems and lattice gases near critical points .",
    "cluster algorithms would be very useful for off - lattice systems , but no general cluster method has yet been developed ; indeed , the _ only _ off - lattice models for which highly efficient cluster methods are known are models of the stillinger - helfand and widom - rowlinson type .",
    "the distinguishing features of this class of models are that particles of the same species have no self - interaction and that there is a purely repulsive interaction between particles of different species . in this case ,",
    "graphical representations and clusters algorithms are available@xcite and have been implemented for the widom - rowlinson model@xcite .",
    "cluster algorithms for spin systems work by identifying clusters of spins and then randomly flipping these clusters .",
    "cluster are defined by placing bonds between nearest neighbor aligned spins with a probability that depends on the temperature . for fluid systems",
    ", bonds are placed between particles of the same type with a probability that depends on the temperature and the interaction potential . instead of flipping spins ,",
    "clusters of particles are removed from the system and then new particles are added via a nonuniform poisson process that depends on the fugacity and the potential due to the remaining particles .",
    "cluster algorithms are typically used with fixed values of the external parameters such as temperature or fugacity . however , when the location of the phase transition is not known , much computational effort in studying the transition is spent in locating the transition . to avoid this problem ,",
    "invaded cluster methods can be used@xcite which automatically adjust a thermodynamic parameter ( for example , temperature or fugacity ) to its value at the phase transition .",
    "this adjustment is accomplished by using the fact ( proved for the @xmath24 case@xcite ) that the clusters just percolate at the transition .",
    "in invaded cluster algorithms , clusters are grown until a signature of percolation is observed .",
    "the value of the thermodynamic parameter at the transition is an output of the simulation obtained from the fraction of successful attempts to add particles or bonds to the system .",
    "the invaded cluster algorithm also may be used to distinguish first - order from continuous transitions as discussed in ref.@xcite for potts models . this method for distinguishing the order of the transition",
    "is discussed below and will be used in section  [ sec : stepq ] .",
    "we first describe the cluster algorithm discussed in section  3.5 of ref.@xcite for  models and then discuss how it can be modified to be an invaded cluster algorithm .",
    "we assume that we have a configuration consisting of particle positions and a set of bonds connecting some of the particles and describe how to obtain the next configuration :    1 .",
    "identify all clusters of particles defined by the bonds .",
    "a particle with no bonds is considered to be a singleton cluster . for each cluster ,",
    "independently and with probability @xmath21 , label it a _ black _ cluster and with probability @xmath25 label it _",
    "white_. 2 .",
    "remove all particles in black clusters .",
    "the remaining white particles are at a set of positions @xmath26 .",
    "3 .   replenish the black particles via a poisson process with local intensity @xmath27 given by + @xmath28 + @xmath29 + where @xmath15 is the fugacity and @xmath9 the potential .",
    "4 .   for each pair of black particles , place a new _ bond _ between them with probability @xmath30 given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the separation between the particles . note that @xmath30 is minus the mayer @xmath3-function for the potential .",
    "eliminate the white and black labels for the clusters .",
    "this procedure comprises one monte carlo step .",
    "given a configuration of particle positions and bonds without species labels , it is possible to obtain a full multicomponent configuration where each particle has a species label .",
    "this assignment is accomplished by identifying clusters and then randomly and independently assigning one of the @xmath0 species labels to each cluster .",
    "the species label of each particle is taken to be the species label of its cluster .",
    "this labeling of particles is only possible if @xmath0 is a positive integer .",
    "however , the algorithm makes sense for all @xmath6 , in analogy to the relation between potts models , which are defined for positive integer @xmath0 , and random cluster models which interpolate between them and are defined for all @xmath33 .",
    "it is instructive to consider the nature of the cluster configurations generated by the algorithm as a function of the fugacity for a fixed temperature .",
    "suppose that the fugacity and , hence , the density is very small .",
    "then @xmath30 is typically small because the particles are far apart , and most clusters are singletons . in step 2 , a fraction @xmath21 of the particles is removed . in step 3 ,",
    "particles are replenished as a nearly ideal gas because the exponential factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : intensity ] ) is a small perturbation except in the vicinity of the remaining particles .",
    "the end result is a nearly ideal multi - component gas . in the limit of large fugacity and density",
    ", we expect a phase in which a single species is predominant with a small admixture of the other species .",
    "the bonds connecting particles of the dominant species are sufficiently dense that almost all members of this species are in a single large cluster .",
    "the minority species are almost all in widely scattered singleton clusters .",
    "when the majority species is white , as occurs in about @xmath21 of the monte carlo steps , the large cluster is removed and then replaced as a nearly ideal gas in a slightly perturbed background potential generated by the minority species . an important feature of this picture is that the clusters do not percolate at small fugacity and do percolate at large fugacity . at some intermediate value of the fugacity",
    ", there must be a percolation transition .",
    "as discussed in refs.@xcite , the percolation transition of the clusters coincides with the demixing transition of the fluid .",
    "the coincidence of the percolation transition and the demixing transition justifies an invaded cluster version of the above cluster algorithm .",
    "the invaded cluster algorithm is very similar to the fixed @xmath15 cluster algorithm described above except that steps 3 and 4 are modified as follows . instead of putting down new black particles as a poisson process at a fixed intensity , black particles",
    "are added to the system one at a time according to the potential @xmath34 ( see below ) .",
    "after each black particle is added , bonds between the new particle and all previously placed black particles are put down with probability @xmath35 .",
    "the black clusters defined by these bonds are monitored after each particle is added , and the process of adding particles is stopped when a _ stopping condition _ is satisfied . for simulating the phase transition , the stopping condition is that one cluster",
    "_ spans _ the system . for periodic boundary conditions , spanning",
    "is taken to mean that a cluster wraps around the system in at least one of the @xmath7 directions .",
    "the spanning condition insures that the algorithm simulates the phase transition@xcite .    in practice",
    ", a particle is added to the system according to the potential @xmath34 by the following procedure .",
    "a particle is tentatively placed at a random position @xmath36 .",
    "a random number @xmath32 is chosen in the interval @xmath37 , and the particle placement is accepted if @xmath38 otherwise the particle is rejected and another attempt is made to place a particle .",
    "let @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the total number of attempted particle placements in a monte carlo step , including both accepted and rejected placements , @xmath41 is the system volume , and the brackets @xmath42 indicate an average over the simulation . because the intensity @xmath27 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : intensity ] ) , and the boltzmann factor @xmath43 governing particle placements differ by a factor of the fugacity , we conclude that @xmath44 is an estimator of @xmath45 , the value of the fugacity at the transition .",
    "note that if the fluctuations @xmath46 in @xmath47 are small , then the invaded cluster algorithm is essentially identical to the fixed fugacity algorithm operating at @xmath48 .",
    "this identification justifies the use of the invaded cluster method . a more complete discussion of the invaded cluster method and the use of @xmath44 as an estimator of a critical parameter is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "whenever the invaded cluster method simulates a system at its critical point , scaling methods can be used to obtain critical exponents from the size dependence of divergent thermodynamic quantities such as the compressibility or the susceptibility . to study the latter",
    ", we consider the quantity @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the number of particles in the @xmath51th cluster . we now show that @xmath52 is related to the usual susceptibility .",
    "consider , for simplicity , the discretized version of the  model on a lattice of linear dimension @xmath53 with spacing @xmath54 so that the total number of sites is @xmath55^d$ ] .",
    "the demixing order parameter at site @xmath36 is given by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 if there is a particle of type 1 at site @xmath36 and @xmath58 otherwise ; @xmath59 counts the presence of a particle of _ any _ type .",
    "the relevant susceptibility @xmath60 is defined by the second derivative of the pressure with respect to the ( ordering ) chemical potential : @xmath61 ( the reason that @xmath54 does not enter explicitly into eq .",
    "( [ eq : chidef ] ) is that the derivatives are with respect to the log of the activity and it is the activity that is scaled by @xmath54 . ) for a given particle and bond configuration , averaging over assignments of species labels , it is clear that @xmath62 vanishes unless the sites @xmath36 and @xmath63 are both occupied and in the same cluster , in which case the result is @xmath64 .",
    "thus , for a fixed particle - bond configuration , we obtain the number of particles in the cluster at @xmath36 if we sum over @xmath63 .",
    "summing over @xmath36 yields the sum of the squares of the cluster sizes so that @xmath65 , and hence we conclude that @xmath52 is related to the usual susceptibility .",
    "finally , finite size scaling predicts that @xmath66 so that the scaling of @xmath52 with system size can be used to extract the magnetic exponent @xmath67 .",
    "cluster methods also may be used to distinguish first - order from continuous transitions . for this purpose ,",
    "a fixed density stopping rule is used .",
    "black particles are added to the system until the density @xmath68 reaches a fixed value and then @xmath44 is measured . in this way",
    "the canonical ensemble is simulated rather than the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "this procedure is done for a range of densities near the transition .",
    "if the transition is continuous , the fugacity is a strictly increasing function of @xmath68 .",
    "however , if the transition is first - order , then the fugacity does not increase monotonically with increasing @xmath68 in the coexistence region .",
    "why does the nature of the @xmath44 versus @xmath68 curve signify whether a transition is continuous or first - order ?",
    "suppose that the demixing transition of a @xmath0-component system is first - order .",
    "at the transition , there is coexistence of @xmath69 phases ; @xmath0 demixed phases and one mixed phase . because the repulsive interaction is reduced for the demixed phases , these phases have a higher density than the mixed phase .",
    "thus , in the thermodynamic limit , there is a range of @xmath68 for which the fugacity is constant .",
    "let @xmath70 be the density of the mixed phase and @xmath71 the density of the demixed phase . because @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the entropy density , we have that @xmath73 is a linear function of @xmath68 in the coexistence region . more specifically , @xmath74 is a linear combination of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the entropy densities of the mixed and demixed phases .",
    "the linearity of @xmath74 applies in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , for a finite system , the entropy density is not linear in the coexistence region .",
    "consider a system with linear dimension @xmath53 and periodic boundary conditions at density @xmath68 .",
    "this system also can be viewed as an infinite system with periodic constraints on the particles .",
    "let @xmath77 be the entropy density of this periodically constrained system .",
    "now suppose the constraints are removed and the system comes to equilibrium .",
    "if @xmath78 , demixing will occur spontaneously so that @xmath79 with the equality holding only at the endpoints of the coexistence range . because @xmath80 , we must have that @xmath15 is non - monotone in the coexistence region .",
    "this approach for distinguishing the order of a transition is very similar to the microcanonical monte carlo method used in ref.@xcite .",
    "in section  [ sec : gaussian ] we present results for the 2d and 3d  gaussian molecule models .",
    "the two - component step potential model is discussed in section  [ sec : step2 ] and the @xmath0-component step potential is discussed in section  [ sec : stepq ] .",
    "we simulated the gaussian molecule model ( with the potential @xmath81 defined in eq .  ( [ eqn : sh ] ) ) using the invaded cluster method and the spanning rule described in section  [ sec : methods ] for a range of linear dimensions @xmath53 up to 140 in @xmath82 and 40 in @xmath23 .",
    "we choose units such that distances are measured in units of @xmath83 .",
    "we collected statistics for the number of particles in the spanning cluster @xmath84 , the critical density @xmath68 , the susceptibility @xmath52 , the estimator of the critical fugacity @xmath44 and its standard deviation @xmath46 , and the normalized autocorrelation function for the spanning cluster size , @xmath85 . for each value of @xmath53 we averaged over @xmath86 monte carlo steps .",
    "the estimator of the critical density is the average number of particles ( of any species ) per unit area ( volume ) when the spanning condition is fulfilled .",
    "although @xmath87 does not go to zero at finite @xmath32 , it becomes very small for larger @xmath32 and to speed the calculation , we set @xmath88 for @xmath89 .",

    "the integrated autocorrelation time @xmath90 is defined by @xmath91 this time is approximately the number of monte carlo steps between statistically independent configurations and enters into the error estimate for @xmath84 . in practice , @xmath92 becomes indistinguishable from the noise for @xmath93 monte carlo steps , and it is necessary to cut off the upper limit of the sum defining @xmath90 when the magnitude of @xmath85 becomes comparable to its error .",
    "note that the fluctuations @xmath46 in @xmath44 decrease with increasing @xmath53 and that @xmath90 is small and hardly increases with @xmath53 .",
    "these results demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the invaded cluster algorithm .",
    "the decrease in @xmath46 shows that as @xmath53 increases , the invaded cluster becomes essentially equivalent to a fixed parameter cluster algorithm for which detailed balance can be proven .",
    "the error estimates for all quantities in tables  [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] except @xmath90 were obtained by computing the standard deviation of the quantity of interest and dividing by the square root of the number of measurements .",
    "this error estimate does not take into account correlations between successive monte carlo steps . to account for correlations ,",
    "the error estimates in the tables for an observable @xmath94 must be multiplied by @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the integrated autocorrelation time for @xmath94 .",
