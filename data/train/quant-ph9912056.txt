    "while the schrdinger equation and time - sliced path integrals , as defined in the textbook @xcite , are invariant under coordinate transformations by construction , this invariance is completely nontrivial in perturbatively defined path integrals in curvilinear coordinates .",

    "generalized functions can only be combined linearly and by a convolution , but products of them are still forbidden calling for regularization @xcite .",
