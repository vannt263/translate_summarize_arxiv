    "gurtin and pipkin in @xcite introduce a model of heat transfer with finite propagation speed . a linearized model with the zero memory at @xmath7",
    "can be written @xcite as : @xmath8 with homogeneous dbc .",
    "here @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "regularity of this equation in more general setting is studied in @xcite , but in one - dimensional case it is possible to obtain regularity results directly using fourier method .",
    "two kind of controllability of this system are studied in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we will study this equation with the kernel in the form @xmath1 with positive @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath11    note that for @xmath12 we have in fact the wave equation @xmath13 .",
    "first , apply the fourier method : we set @xmath14 and expand the solution and the initial data in series in @xmath15 @xmath16 for the components we obtain @xmath17    we will denote the laplace image by the capital characters . applying the laplace transform to system we find @xmath18 or @xmath19    we will need to study zeros of the function @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 , @xmath22 be the set of zeros of @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the set @xmath25 is called the spectrum of system 1 .",
    "the laplace image of @xmath26 is @xmath27 this is a meromorphic function real valued on the real axis and mapping the upper half plane to the lower one and visa versa .",
    "@xmath28 has only real zeros @xmath29 , @xmath30 such that @xmath31    proof of the lemma since @xmath32 all zeros are real .",
    "the lemma follows now from from the fact that @xmath33 runs the real axis on every interval @xmath34 , see the figure .    @xmath35    ' '' ''     +        [ main ] let @xmath36 then the sets @xmath21 can be represented as @xmath37 with @xmath38 and the spectrum is in the left half plane .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath39 are real and for fixed @xmath40 we have @xmath41 and the sequence @xmath42 is in @xmath43 : @xmath44    [ r1 ] in @xcite regularity of the gurtin - pipkin equation of the second order in time is studied in more general situation . in @xcite",
    "the authors consider this equation with model kernel and find the asymptotic of complex zeros of the the function @xmath45 where @xmath46 in this case @xmath47",
    "the authors are grateful to prof .",
    "eremenko for very helpful consultations .",
    "first show that the spectrum is in the left half plane . if @xmath48 , @xmath49 , then @xmath50 for the real part we have @xmath51 if @xmath52",
    ", then this expression is positive .",
    "we are going to apply the argument principle .",
    "fix @xmath53 and take the rectangle contour @xmath54 with the vertices @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 we show that we can take @xmath58 , and @xmath59 in such a way that @xmath60 consider the side @xmath61 .",
    "for @xmath62 we have @xmath63              the estimate on @xmath82 is the same as for @xmath83 because @xmath84 on the rest side @xmath85 we have @xmath86 since @xmath87 we have if @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath89 and with we have and we can conclude that @xmath90 where @xmath65 and @xmath91 denote respectively the number of zeros and poles of the function inside the contour @xmath54 , with each zero and pole counted as many times as its multiplicity and order respectively . evidently , @xmath92 . inside @xmath54",
    "the function @xmath93 has @xmath65 simple poles at @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "therefore @xmath96 .",
    "we see that the straight line @xmath100 intersects the graph of @xmath33 in @xmath43 and monotonically approaches @xmath101 as @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "thus , there exists @xmath65 or @xmath97 real zeros of @xmath23 inside @xmath99 depending whether @xmath104 is more or less @xmath105 . in the first case",
    "we have exactly one complex zero of @xmath23 what is impossible by .",
    "find the estimate of @xmath135 from below .",
    "for @xmath136 @xmath137 from lemma [ asympk ] we have in the sector @xmath138 take @xmath53 large enough in order that @xmath139 then @xmath140 now @xmath141 .",
    "we have proved that @xmath142 is in the box centered at @xmath143 and with the diameter @xmath144 .",
    "the condition is evidently fulfilled if @xmath6 . for a model case @xmath147 @xmath148 and",
    "is true if and only if@xmath149 . using the proposed approach we have to show that",
    "@xmath150 this is not true for slowly increasing @xmath5 , say , @xmath151 .",
    "nevertheless we have the conjecture that main theorem is true for every kernel satisfying ."
