    "the photoproduction of large-@xmath0 jets , photons or hadrons are privileged reactions to study qcd and to measure the parton distributions in the proton and in the photon . in the past",
    ", the interest was mainly focused on the production of jets @xcite , and more recently on the production of photons @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting are the dijet cross sections @xcite , or the photon - jet cross sections @xcite , because the measurement of two jets or particles in the final state allows one to constrain the incoming parton kinematics and to explore the parton distributions in an accurate way .    in this paper we present results concerning the large-@xmath0 photoproduction of a charged hadron and a jet , @xmath5 .",
    "this reaction offers several interesting features in comparison with dijet or photon - jet reactions . with respect to the latter ,",
    "the hadron - jet cross section is much higher ; the observation of a hadron is also easier than that of a photon .",
    "compared to the dijet reaction , the hadron - jet one is also easier to measure , this fact being particularly true at small @xmath0 ( @xmath6  5 - 10  gev ) where it is difficult to model the underlying event contribution and to unambiguously measure the transverse momentum of two jets .",
    "it should also be possible to explore a larger rapidity domain for the hadron since there is no cone `` hitting the edge '' of the detector .",
    "these features are important when one focuses on the measurement of the parton distributions in the photon .",
    "as is well known , there are two contributions to photoproduction cross sections : the so - called direct and resolved contributions .",
    "the resolved contribution is important at small values of @xmath0 and at large positive rapidities , a kinematic domain that the hadron - jet reaction should allow one to explore .",
    "the theoretical description of the hadron - jet cross sections requires the knowledge of the fragmentation functions of quarks and gluons into hadrons .",
    "this might appear as a disadvantage with respect to the jet - jet reaction .",
    "however one has to note that hadronisation corrections are also needed in jet reactions to describe the evolution of partons into hadrons and they are not totally under control .",
    "moreover fragmentation functions are now well measured in lep experiments and several recent nlo parametrisations of quark and gluon fragmentation functions are available @xcite .",
    "these fragmentation functions have been tested in inclusive charged hadron production in @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 collisions by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite ; they found a good agreement between theory and data , which confirms that the fragmentation functions are under control .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the hadron - jet physics and assess the possibility to constrain the parton distribution functions of the photon and of the proton . in jet - jet reactions",
    ", it is usual to constrain the momentum of the incoming partons by means of the variables @xmath10 and of the variables @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are the energies of the incoming proton respectively photon .",
    "( we follow the hera convention with the proton momentum oriented toward the positive @xmath13-axis and the photon momentum toward the negative @xmath13-axis ) . for the born contributions , with only two jets in the final state , the variables",
    "@xmath14 exactly correspond to the longitudinal momentum fractions of the partons in the proton and in the photon .",
    "when higher order qcd corrections are considered , the variables @xmath14 do not fix the initial momenta any more , but they still put useful constraints on these momenta .",
    "the situation is different in the hadron - jet case because the hadron momentum @xmath15 is only a fraction of the momentum of the outgoing parton , such that @xmath14 ( with @xmath16 replaced by @xmath15 ) do not even for the born cross - section correspond to the incoming parton momenta anymore .",
    "therefore it is interesting to study the usefulness of such variables in the hadron - jet case , and how they can help to measure the proton and photon parton distributions .",
    "the results presented in this paper are based on a nlo monte carlo program which generates events containing 2 or 3 partons in the final state .",
    "one of them fragments into a large-@xmath0 hadron , and the others are recombined into jets .",
    "this nlo event generator provides a flexible approach to implement experimental cuts and to calculate a large variety of observables .",
    "the theoretical framework and the monte carlo program are presented in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we compare theoretical predictions for the inclusive ( i.e. no jet observed ) cross section with h1 data  @xcite .",
    "the emphasis is put on the study of the sensitivity of the cross section to the factorisation and renormalisation scales , and to different fragmentation function parametrisations . in section 4",
    "we study the hadron - jet cross section and explore the distributions @xmath17 , in particular their sensitivity to the gluon densities in the proton and the photon .",
    "section 5 is the conclusion .",
    "the nlo monte carlo program used in this paper has already been described in refs .",
    "@xcite in which the photoproduction of isolated prompt photons is studied .",
    "therefore we only give a few indications on the general structure of the program here and discuss the new features specific to the photoproduction of hadrons .    in photoproduction events , the electron acts like a source of quasi - real photons",
    "whose spectrum can be described by the weizscker - williams formula    [ 1e ] f_^e(y ) = _ em 2 \\ { 1 + ( 1 - y)^2 y   - 2(1-y ) y }  .",
    "the quasi - real photon then either takes part _ directly _ in the hard scattering process , or it acts as a composite object , being a source of partons which take part in the hard subprocess . the latter mechanism is referred to as _ resolved _ process and is parametrised by the photon structure functions @xmath18 .",
    "thus the distribution of partons in the electron is a convolution    [ 2e ] f_a",
    "/ e(x_e , m ) = _ 0 ^ 1",
    "dy  dx_f_^e(y )  f_a/(x_,m ) ( x_y - x_e )    where in the `` direct '' case @xmath19 .",
    "the production of the final hadron @xmath20 with momentum @xmath21 is described by a fragmentation function @xmath22 where @xmath13 is the fraction of the longitudinal momentum of the parton @xmath23 carried away by the hadron @xmath20 .",
    "the production cross section of a large-@xmath0 hadron and a jet is written as a convolution of the distributions of initial partons , the fragmentation of the final parton and the hard scattering cross sections    [ 3e ] & & d^eph jet(p_p , p_e , p_h , p_jet ) = _ a , b , c dx_e dx_p dz",

    "they are expansions in powers of @xmath25    [ 4e ] d^bc jet = _ s ( )  d^bc  jet_born + _ s^2 ( )  d^bc jet_ho ( , m , m_f ) + o(_s^3 )    [ 5e ] d^a bc jet = _",
    "s^2()d^abc jet_born + _",
    "s^3()d^abc jet_ho ( , m , m_f ) + o(_s^4 )  .",
    "in expressions ( [ 3e ] ) , ( [ 4e ] ) and ( [ 5e ] ) , we have explicitly written the dependence on the large scales @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "( for simplicity we choose the same factorisation scale @xmath27 for the incoming photon and proton . )",
    "the cross section ( [ 3e ] ) would not depend on these large scales if it were calculated to all orders in @xmath25 .",
    "but after truncation of the series ( [ 4e ] ) and ( [ 5e ] ) , the cross section will depend on @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath26- , @xmath27- and @xmath28-dependence of the ho terms partially compensates the scale - dependence of the born cross sections , and in the next sections we shall study the sensitivity of @xmath29 to the renormalisation scale @xmath26 and the factorisation scales @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "let us now discuss the various components of formula ( [ 3e ] ) .",
    "the fragmentation functions @xmath22 have been accurately measured in lep experiments and several nlo parametrisations of the latter are now available @xcite . there exist non - negligible differences between the parametrisations of individual @xmath30 , especially at large @xmath31 , but for cross sections involving sums over the flavours @xmath23 and over the hadrons @xmath20 the differences are tiny . in photoproduction ,",
    "the weights of the different flavours which contribute to the cross section are identical to those of the @xmath32-annihilation reaction ( at least for the direct contribution )",
    ". therefore the differences between the individual contributions should be smoothed when summed over to form the cross section . in the next section",
    "we shall check the sensitivity of the photoproduction cross section to the fragmentation functions .",
    "we now turn to another important component of formula ( [ 3e ] ) , the quark and gluon distributions in the photon . in this paper",
    "we use a new nlo parametrisation of these distributions , the afg02 parametrisation @xcite .",
    "the afg02 parametrisation is an evolution of the afg @xcite parametrisation .",
    "the new distributions are more flexible : for instance the shape and normalisation of the non - perturbative gluon distribution can be modified .",
    "this fact allows one to study the sensitivity of cross sections to the gluon distribution .",
    "the normalisation of the non - perturbative quark distributions can also be adjusted .",
    "contrarily to the afg distributions , the afg02 distributions also contain the bottom quark distribution . in this paper",
    "we shall use the default afg02 parametrisation which is almost identical to the afg parametrisation ; the only differences are the number of flavours and the value of @xmath33  mev ( @xmath34  mev was used in the afg parametrisation in agreement with the value of @xmath35 determined ten years ago ) . as a result , due to a faster qcd evolution , the afg02 distributions are slightly higher at small @xmath36 and lower at large @xmath36 than the afg distributions .",
    "+ for the parton distributions in the proton , we use mrst99 ( g@xmath37 )  @xcite as default . for the hadron - jet cross section",
    ", we will also use the new mrst01  @xcite and cteq6 m  @xcite sets for comparison .",
    "we use a strong coupling constant calculated by solving exactly ( i.e. without expansion in log@xmath38 ) the two - loop renormalisation group equation .",
    "we work with @xmath39 active flavours as default . using @xmath40 the total cross section increases by about 5%",
    ".    expression ( [ 3e ] ) is calculated via a mc code which generates @xmath41 and @xmath42 parton configurations according to weights given by the subprocess cross sections and the distribution functions . a phase space slicing method",
    "is used to isolate and to analytically calculate the soft and collinear singular contributions of the @xmath43 cross sections .",
    "the soft divergences are cancelled by the corresponding divergences contained in the virtual corrections to the @xmath44 processes ( uv divergences are removed by renormalisation in the @xmath45 scheme ) .",
    "the remaining collinear singularities are factored out and absorbed in the distribution and fragmentation functions using the @xmath45 scheme .",
    "this monte carlo code , which uses the event generator bases / spring @xcite , is a partonic event generator : it contains negative weights coming for instance from the virtual corrections to the born cross sections .",
    "it is very flexible and allows one to study various cross sections involving a large-@xmath0 hadron and jets .",
    "experimental cuts are easily taken into account , as well as different jet algorithms . in this paper",
    ", we use the @xmath46-algorithm @xcite to define the jets .",
    "in this section we study the photoproduction of large-@xmath0 inclusive hadrons .",
    "similar studies and comparisons with data have already been performed in several publications @xcite .",
    "therefore we shall not carry out an exhaustive study of this reaction , but we shall concentrate on the sensitivity of the cross section to the factorisation and renormalisation scales , and to different parametrisations of the fragmentation functions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we display a study of the scale dependence .",
    "the theoretical curves are compared to h1 data @xcite corresponding to the following kinematic conditions .",
    "the parameters of the weizscker - williams formula are @xmath48gev@xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath1 center of mass energy is @xmath51  gev .",
    "the cross section for large-@xmath0 charged hadrons is measured in the pseudo - rapidity domain @xmath52 .",
    "the theoretical curves are obtained with the bfgw fragmentation functions  @xcite and we use @xmath33mev .",
    "+ we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that the data are described fairly well , in particular that no intrinsic @xmath46 is needed to describe the data at low @xmath0 , contrarily to what has been found in the e706 experiment on fixed target inclusive @xmath53 production  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show on a linear scale the ratios of the cross sections calculated with @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) to the cross section calculated at @xmath56 , where @xmath0 is the transverse momentum of the final state hadron . results obtained with the kkp  @xcite fragmentation function parametrisations are also displayedgev in the kkp ratio may stem from the fact that the charm threshold is at @xmath57 in these paramtrisations .",
    "therefore there is no charm contribution below @xmath58gev in the case @xmath59 , whereas for @xmath56 the charm contributes already at 3gev . in the bfgw parametrisations",
    "the charm threshold is at @xmath60 , such that the charm contributes at @xmath61gev even for @xmath59 . ] .",
    "we clearly see a strong dependence of the cross section on the scales for @xmath62gev .",
    "below 7gev the perturbative calculation is not reliable , the ho corrections being very large .",
    "moreover , for the choice @xmath63 we explore a range of the factorisation scales ( @xmath64gev ) which is very far from the kinematic region where the fragmentation functions have been constrained .",
    "we also find a strong scale dependence of the rapidity distribution @xmath65 which is measured in the range 3gev @xmath66gev . in table  [ mum ] we give the results of a study of @xmath67 in which we separately vary @xmath26 and @xmath27 , keeping fixed @xmath68 .",
    "the upper number is the total cross section ( direct + resolved ) and the lower number is the ratio @xmath69 .",
    "the variation of the cross section with @xmath70 is very strong for small values of @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) corresponding to large values of @xmath73 .",
    "there is no region where the cross section @xmath74 is almost independent of @xmath75 and @xmath71 , and the ratio @xmath76 is always large . we again conclude that the theoretical predictions are not reliable for @xmath77  gev , a @xmath0-region which gives an important contribution to the cross section integrated over 3gev @xmath78gev .",
    ".@xmath79-dependence of the total cross section integrated over @xmath80 and 3gev@xmath8112gev .",
    "the fragmentation scale has been kept fixed to @xmath82 .",
    "the bold numbers denote the total cross section in nb , the numbers in italic represent the ratio @xmath83 .",
    "one can see that there is no region of stability for a value of @xmath84 as low as 3gev . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     this investigation is very cpu time consuming .",
    "therefore , for a study of the optimum of @xmath85 in various bins in @xmath86 , we used the following simplified approach .",
    "we fix the scale @xmath28 to the optimal value of table  [ mumhjet ] , @xmath87 , and look for optima of @xmath85 in the @xmath88plane for the @xmath86 bins of fig .",
    "[ figrapsca ] . the corresponding cross section is shown in fig .  [ figrapsca ] and we see that it is close to the cross section obtained with @xmath89 .",
    "it is encouraging to note that the data of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are in good agreement with theory calculated with @xmath59 in the range @xmath90gev .",
    "let us now discuss the cross sections @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "features of this cross sections are displayed in figs .",
    "[ figxga ] to  [ figlu0p ] .",
    "[ figxga ] gives a clear illustration of the differences between the variables @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "in the partonic variable @xmath93 ( see eq.([xtrue ] ) ) , the cross section would have a peak at @xmath94 , mainly due to the direct born contribution which is proportional to @xmath95 .",
    "this peak is shifted to lower values of @xmath96 and @xmath97 due to the relation @xmath98 , where @xmath23 is the `` parent '' parton of the hadron @xmath20 .",
    "this shift is larger for the variable @xmath96 , as discussed at the beginning of this section .",
    "we observe a similar , but much less pronounced pattern for the proton variable @xmath99 ; the partonic distributions in the proton decrease rapidly with @xmath100 and this behaviour is reflected in the distributions of fig .",
    "[ figxp ] , @xmath101 having a smaller width than @xmath102 .",
    "[ figxga3raps ] displays a detailed study of the resolved and direct contributions as functions of @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "as already remarked , the shift of the peak to lower values of @xmath103 is more pronounced for @xmath96 than for @xmath97 .",
    "the effect of cuts in @xmath86 and @xmath104 are also clearly visible , the kinematic region @xmath105 contributing to the low @xmath103 domain , and the region @xmath106 to the large @xmath103 domain .",
    "the relative size of the resolved and direct contributions as given in fig .",
    "[ figxga3raps ] is of course dependent on the scale choice ( @xmath107 for fig .",
    "[ figxga3raps ] ) .",
    "as already said at the beginning of this section , only the total cross section is a physical observable .",
    "the variation of the size of the direct and resolved contributions with the scales varied by the factor @xmath108 is shown in fig .",
    "[ figxresdir ] .",
    "for instance , we observe that for @xmath109 the resolved component is almost stable whereas the direct component strongly varies .",
    "the hadron - jet cross section offers the possibility to measure the parton distributions in the proton and in the photon .",
    "the quark distributions are constrained by dis experiments ( very well in the proton case , and with rather large errors in the photon case ) .",
    "therefore , concerning the quark distributions , the hadron - jet cross section can only put some additional constraints on @xmath110 .",
    "the situation with respect to the gluon distribution is different .",
    "the gluon distributions are not well determined in dis experiments because the virtual photon couples at leading order only to quarks , such that the gluon distributions appear only at the level of higher order corrections .",
    "this is not the case for the hadron - jet cross section where the gluon distributions appear already at the born level .",
    "therefore we expect an important sensitivity of the cross section to the gluon distributions , especially in the kinematic regions where @xmath111 is small .",
    "this point is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ figlu0ga ] to [ figlu0p ] .    in fig .",
    "[ figlu0ga ] , we observe that the gluon in the photon makes a large contribution at small @xmath103 , @xmath112 .",
    "however , the cross section is small in this @xmath103 region because the cuts @xmath113 and @xmath114 forbid to reach low values of @xmath103 . using different cuts which reinforce the small @xmath103 region , namely @xmath115",
    ", we obtain the results shown in fig .",
    "[ figrap13 ] .",
    "we see that the cross section in the small @xmath103 region is much larger and made up almost entirely by the resolved contribution .",
    "the afg02 parton distributions for the photon allow to modify the normalisation of the non - perturbative vdm component . in order to exhibit the sensitivity to this component",
    ", we show a curve where the coefficient of this vdm input has been set to zero .",
    "we also show the magnitude of the gluon contribution to @xmath116 in this kinematic range .",
    "we conclude from fig .",
    "[ figrap13 ] that the rapidity cuts @xmath115 select a kinematic region where the sensitivity of the hadron - jet cross section to the gluon distribution in the photon is very large .",
    "the contribution of the gluon in the proton turns out to be large even with rapidities integrated in the whole range @xmath117 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ figlu0p ] .",
    "we also observe that the effect of using different parton distributions for the proton , namely the mrst99  @xcite , the new mrst01  @xcite and the cteq6 m  @xcite sets , is quite large and mainly due to the different shape of the gluon in the different sets . although the variation of the cross section when varying all scales simultaneously between @xmath118 is larger than the variation due to the different pdf sets , the scale variations rather produce an overall shift of the curve , but do not change the shape . on the other hand , the fact that the gluon distribution of mrst01 peaks at higher @xmath36 values than the one of cteq6 m ( see fig.16 of @xcite ) is clearly reflected in fig.[figlu0p ] .",
    "we also note that the region @xmath119 , corresponding to @xmath120 , is an interesting @xmath36-range because it lies in the window between constraints from hera for lower @xmath36 and the tevatron jet data for higher @xmath36 .",
    "therefore the cross section @xmath121 can serve to further constrain the parton distributions of the proton .",
    "we have studied the photoproduction of inclusive large-@xmath0 charged hadrons and the production of a charged hadron plus a jet . for the inclusive case we compared the @xmath0- and rapidity distributions to h1 data  @xcite and found reasonable agreement . however , for a value of @xmath122 as low as 3gev , the dependence of the nlo result on the renormalisation and factorisation scales is very large . only for @xmath123gev a plateau where the cross section is approximately stable against scale variations could be found .",
    "we also studied the effect of using different fragmentation function parametrisations  @xcite and compared to a previous analysis of kniehl , kramer and ptter  @xcite . for the parton distributions in the photon",
    ", we used the new afg02 parametrisations  @xcite .    for the hadron - jet cross section",
    ", we studied the rapidity distributions and the cross sections @xmath124 .",
    "we analysed the difference between the partonic momentum fractions @xmath125 and the observables @xmath126 defined via the observed transverse momenta and rapidities of the hadron and the jet .",
    "we further proposed a variable @xmath127 which does not require the measurement of the jet transverse energy .",
    "we also carried out an exhaustive study of the scale dependence .",
    "we found a stability region for the cross section integrated over 7gev @xmath128 15gev , @xmath129 5gev and performed a scale optimisation .    finally , we investigated the possibility to constrain the parton distributions ( in particular the gluon distributions ) in the photon and in the proton via the hadron - jet cross section .",
    "we show how rapidity cuts can increase the sensitivity to the gluon distributions in the photon .",
    "we also found a rather large sensitivity to the parton distributions in the proton .",
