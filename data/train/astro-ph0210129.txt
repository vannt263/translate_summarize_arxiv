    "the techniques for measuring surface brightness fluctuations ( sbfs ) were developed primarily with the goal of determining extragalactic distances . the optical sbf method has proven to be remarkably useful for estimating distances ( see blakeslee et al .",
    "1999 for a review ) .",
    "the initial motivation for extending ground - based sbf measurements to near - ir wavelengths was to take advantage of intrinsically brighter fluctuations and better atmospheric seeing to reach much greater distances ( jensen et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter j2001 ; jensen , tonry , & luppino 1999 ; liu & graham 2001 ) . with _",
    "hubble space telescope s _ ( hst ) near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) , the low background and lack of atmospheric seeing offer significant advantages over ground - based ir sbf measurements .",
    "accurate sbf distance measurements rely on the empirical calibration of absolute fluctuation amplitudes .",
    "several studies have used observations of galaxies with previously - measured distances to determine absolute fluctuation magnitudes , which were found to agree with the predictions of stellar population models .",
    "the first ir sbf measurements were made by luppino & tonry ( 1993 ) , who found that m32 has a somewhat brighter ( @xmath7  mag ) @xmath8-band sbf magnitude than the bulge of m31 .",
    "pahre & mould ( 1994 ) measured @xmath8-band sbf magnitudes for a sample of virgo galaxies , and found that two of eight had significantly brighter ( @xmath9  mag ) fluctuations than the others .",
    "pahre & mould s results were confirmed by jensen , luppino , & tonry ( 1996 ) in their sample of seven virgo cluster elliptical galaxies .",
    "the ir sbf signal for one of the two anomalous galaxies ( ngc  4365 ) was later found to have been over - estimated due to the contribution of undetected globular clusters ( jensen , tonry , & luppino 1998 ) ; the other ( ngc  4489 ) still appeared to have brighter fluctuations than the others .    to the 1996 virgo sample , jensen et al . ( 1998 ) added galaxies in the fornax and eridanus clusters .",
    "three of the bluest galaxies in their sample showed @xmath8-band fluctuation magnitudes that were @xmath7  mag brighter than the others .",
    "jensen et al . noted that the models implied younger stellar populations in these bluer ellipticals .",
    "however , the sample size was small and the range in @xmath10  color was limited ; hence , the slope they measured was not statistically significant and they adopted a constant @xmath8-band sbf calibration .",
    "the @xmath8-band fluctuations for the bluest galaxy in their sample ( ngc  4489 ) were significantly brighter than the others in the virgo cluster , but the measurement was not trusted due to its low signal - to - noise ( @xmath11 ) ratio .",
    "mei , silva , & quinn ( 2001c ) subsequently re - observed this galaxy and found comparably bright @xmath8-band fluctuations .",
    "recently , a larger sample of @xmath8-band sbf magnitudes for fornax cluster galaxies has been measured by liu , graham , & charlot ( 2002 ) .",
    "combined with the previously published data , the resulting sample covered a much larger range of galaxy properties ( e.g. , color and luminosity ) .",
    "liu et al . ( 2002 ) discovered that the brighter @xmath8-band fluctuations seen in bluer galaxies in their sample and in earlier data sets ( luppino & tonry 1993 ; pahre & mould 1994 ; jensen et al .",
    "1998 ) were correlated with @xmath10 .",
    "liu et al . found the @xmath8-band slope with color to be comparable to that for @xmath1-band sbfs .",
    "this relation naturally explained the bright ir sbfs previously measured in m32 ( luppino & tonry 1993 ) and ngc  4489 ( mei et al .",
    "moreover , a generic prediction of ir sbf models is that ir fluctuations are sensitive to variations in the ages and metallicities of stellar populations .",
    "hence , the discovery of a _",
    "systematic _ relation between ir sbfs and galaxy color means that age and metallicity are related in a way that reflects the star formation history of a galaxy .",
    "liu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) concluded that early - type galaxies in clusters have a significant spread in age and approximately solar metallicities .",
    "liu et al . ( 2002 ) also reported finding three fornax cluster galaxies with @xmath8-band fluctuation magnitudes brighter than the other galaxies with similar @xmath10  colors .",
    "these galaxies were not included in their calibration fit .",
    "they are primarily lower luminosity galaxies , and models suggest the presence of a high - metallicity burst of star formation in the last few gyr .",
    "mei et al .",
    "( 2001a ) have confirmed that one of the three fornax galaxies ( ngc  1427 ) has unusually bright @xmath8-band fluctuations .    to calibrate the f160w ( 1.6 ) sbf distance scale and better understand the nature of the bluer , low - luminosity elliptical galaxies , we measured f160w sbf magnitudes in a large sample of 65 galaxies spanning a wide range in color ( @xmath12@xmath13 to 1.28 ) .",
    "all the data presented here were obtained using the nic2 camera of nicmos .",
    "the data are of uniform image quality , and the @xmath11 ratios are large .",
    "many of the galaxy images were collected for other programs and retrieved from the public archive .",
    "distances to the galaxies in this sample were taken from the growing collection of cepheid variable star distances measured with the @xmath14 ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 , ferrarese et al . 2000b",

    "the @xmath1-band sbf distances used here were calibrated using cepheid distances to the same galaxies ; no assumptions about group or cluster membership were made ( tonry et al . 2001 ) .",
    "for the current study we shifted the @xmath1-sbf distances published by tonry et al .",
    "by @xmath15  mag to the new cepheid zero point of freedman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , which makes use of the improved cepheid period - luminosity relations published by udalski et al .",
    "the distances presented in this paper , whether from cepheids directly or from @xmath1-band sbfs , are subject to the systematic uncertainties in the cepheid distance scale ( ferrarese et al .",
    "we adopted a distance modulus to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) of 18.50 mag ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ; carretta et al .",
    "2000 ) , and acknowledge that the continuing debate over the lmc distance remains one of the largest sources of systematic uncertainty .",
    "in this paper we present a new calibration of the f160w distance scale and explore its sensitivity to galaxy color .",
    "we also compare the absolute fluctuation magnitudes to those predicted by three sets of stellar population models : the widely - used models of worthey ( 1994 ) , the bruzual & charlot ( 1993 , 2002 ) models ( as published by liu , charlot , & graham 2000 and liu et al .",
    "2002 ) , and the vazdekis ( 1999 , 2001 ) models ( as published by blakeslee , vazdekis , & ajhar 2001 ) .",
    "sbf ages determined using stellar population models are compared with those measured using the age - sensitive h@xmath6  balmer line strength .",
    "the observations of galaxies used in this study come from two basic types of nicmos program , each of which accounts for roughly half the data .",
    "the first set of observations came from two programs explicitly designed for sbf measurements .",
    "the first of these ( nicmos program i d 7453 ) targeted galaxies in virgo , leo , and fornax to empirically calibrate the f160w sbf distance scale for more distant measurements .",
    "the second ( program i d 7458 ) measured fluctuations in a large sample of fornax galaxies at multiple wavelengths to better understand stellar populations .",
    "a subset of the measurements presented in this paper was published by j2001 .",
    "the second category of observations is comprised of data taken from the public archive from a variety of programs .",
    "most of these are short , `` snapshot '' survey images of the centers of galaxies , and have only a minimal number of individual exposures .",
    "observational data are listed in table  [ observationtable ] .",
    "the observations presented in this study were taken with the nic2 camera ( 19.2 arcsec field of view ) through the f160w filter .",
    "f160w nic2 observations of approximately 300 galaxies with heliocentric redshifts",
    "less than 10,000 kms@xmath16  were retrieved from the public archive and examined .",
    "a smooth fit to each galaxy was subtracted from the pipeline - reduced image and the residual frame examined .",
    "all the galaxies that were judged to be hopelessly dusty were rejected from further consideration .",
    "data for the remaining @xmath17 galaxies were reduced again from the raw data and the sbf analysis completed following the same procedures as described by j2001 .",
    "the subset of 65 galaxies presented here are those for which reliable distances are known from either cepheid variable stars or @xmath1-band sbfs .",
    "the methodology for determining f160w fluctuation magnitudes was very similar to that described by j2001 , with some simplifications .",
    "we used the software developed by the nicmos gto team to prepare the images for analysis ( thompson et al .",
    "dark current was first subtracted from the raw nic2 f160w images .",
    "the multiple reads of each multiaccum sequence were combined and cosmic rays identified and removed .",
    "adjustment of the bias pedestal for each quadrant was performed as described by j2001 , although it was unnecessary in most cases .",
    "exposures from individual telescope pointings were flat field corrected and combined .",
    "residual images from cosmic rays were not a significant source of contamination in these high-@xmath11 ratio data .    the photometric zero point used by j2001",
    "was determined by m. rieke and the nicmos team .",
    "additional standard star measurements combined with a better tie to ground - based photometry has yielded a better zero point for the nic2 f160w filter .",
    "the new photometric zero point that we adopted for this study is 0.033 mag fainter than that used by j2001 .",
    "the new calibration for nic2 is @xmath18 jyadu@xmath16s@xmath16 .",
    "the magnitude zero point on the vega system is 1083 jy .",
    "this new calibration is within the uncertainty in zero point published by j2001 .",
    "if the current zero point were applied to the j2001 data without any other changes to the calibration , the resulting fluctuation magnitudes would be 0.03 mag fainter , and the hubble constant would be larger by 1.6% .",
    "sbf magnitudes were corrected for galactic extinction using the measurements of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "we adopted @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( schlegel et al 1998 ) .",
    "the galaxies in this sample are much closer than the distant galaxies used by j2001 to determine the hubble constant ( 5 included here were taken from the intermediate - distance sample of j2001 ) .",
    "the median @xmath11 ratio was 16 per pixel for this data set , which , given the large number of pixels sampled , is more than sufficient to achieve a highly - reliable measurement .",
    "most of the data had @xmath11 ratios between 10 and 20 ; the full range includes measurements with @xmath11 ratios as low as 5 and as high as 4000 .",
    "the fluctuation power was determined by fitting the scaled power spectrum of the reference point - spread function ( psf ) to the spatial power spectrum of the cleaned and galaxy - subtracted data .",
    "the library of empirical psf stars collected as part of the ir sbf hubble constant project ( j2001 ) was used to perform the sbf analysis .",
    "a full discussion of the techniques for calculating fluctuation magnitudes @xmath21  from nicmos data is presented by j2001 .    we found that correcting the f160w sbf magnitudes for undetected globular clusters or background galaxies was unnecessary for the relatively - nearby galaxies of this study because the stellar sbf signal always dominated over other sources of variance .",
    "the final galaxy - subtracted images were masked of visible point sources and dusty regions before proceeding with the sbf analysis . only the five intermediate - distance galaxies from j2001 required corrections for undetected globular clusters , background galaxies , and residual background patterns ( as described by j2001 ) .",
    "the uncertainties in apparent fluctuation magnitudes @xmath21  were typically 0.1 mag or less .",
    "the primary components of the uncertainty were the fit to fluctuation power and the psf normalization ( usually 0.05 mag each ) . the contribution from sky subtraction was much smaller ( typically 0.01 mag ) .",
    "contributions to the uncertainty from undetected globular clusters or background galaxies were negligible ( @xmath22  mag ) , and contaminating power from residual cosmic rays or incomplete bias subtraction were unmeasurable in these high-@xmath11 ratio measurements .      computing the absolute fluctuation magnitudes @xmath0  for the galaxies in our sample required independent distance measurements .",
    "all the distance moduli used in this study ( table  [ mbartable ] ) were based , either directly or indirectly , on cepheid variable star distances .",
    "two classes of distance measurements are presented here : first , a large set of 61 @xmath1-band sbf distances ( calibrated using cepheid distances as described by tonry et al .",

    "the original key project calibration of the cepheid distance scale ( ferrarese et al .",

    "no metallicity correction to the cepheid distances is adopted for this study .",
    "the modifications to the period  luminosity relation adopted by freedman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) are distance dependent .",
    "the new period  luminosity relation is different for the @xmath1-band , while at @xmath23 it is unchanged ( udalski et al .",
    "the effect is that the new period  luminosity relation predicts higher reddening corrections for redder cepheids , and therefore smaller distances .",
    "the effect is largest in cepheids with longer periods . because only the brightest ( longest - period ) cepheids are detected in the most distant galaxies , the offset between the previously - published distances and those derived using the new calibration are largest in the most distant galaxies ( @xmath24 mag , or 10% in distance ) .",
    "the offset to the @xmath1-band sbf calibration due to the new period - luminosity relation is 0.16 mag , or 8% in distance .",

    "the apparently better agreement with the reliable maser distance to the galaxy ngc 4258 is offered as evidence that the theoretical relationship is more realistic .",
    "of course a slightly smaller distance modulus to the lmc would also explain the difference , so the maser distance to ngc  4258 can not be regarded as evidence that the metallicity correction must have a particular sign or magnitude .",
    "given the uncertainty in the metallicity correction at this point , we chose not to adjust the @xmath1-band sbf calibration . in the end , the size of the metallicity correction is not very important provided that the correction is applied consistently through the lmc rung of the distance ladder .",
    "we note that the metallicity - corrected cepheid distances reported by freedman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) are based on cepheid measurements of lmc cepheids that have not been corrected for metallicity .",
    "given the similarity in metallicity between galactic cepheids and most of the spiral galaxies in which cepheids have been detected , the effect of a fully - consistent metallicity - corrected cepheid distance scale and the uncorrected calibration we adopted for this paper is minimal ( approximately 0.02  mag ) .",
    "the data plotted in the figures are based on distances that include no metallicity corrections .",
