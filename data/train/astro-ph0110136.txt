    "over the last decade , a comprehensive catalogue of compact flat spectrum radio sources , the jodrell bank @xmath10 vla astrometric survey ( jvas ) , has been constructed ( patnaik et al , 1992 ; browne et al . , 1997 ; wilkinson et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the main aim of this survey was to provide the astronomical community with a network of bright radio sources with accurate positions ( @xmath11 mas ) primarily intended for use as phase calibrators for the jodrell bank merlin , the vla and vlbi networks .",
    "in addition to its astrometric goals , jvas proved an effective means of finding radio sources exhibiting strong gravitational lensing , with six systems confirmed to date ( king et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "its virtually complete northern - sky coverage makes jvas uniquely suited for studying the high luminosity end of the flat spectrum radio source population .",
    "our group has been particularly involved in the search for distant quasars ( hook et al .",
    "1996 , hook et al .",
    "1998 , hook & mcmahon 1998 ) . as part of this project ,",
    "sources in the jvas survey were optically identified using the catalogue output of the apm ( the automated plate measurement facility at cambridge ) scans of the poss - i plates .",
    "this catalogue is ideal for identifying large samples of objects , since they are generated in an automated way allowing an objective assessment of their reliability and homogeneity .",
    "this paper describes the automated optical identification procedure of jvas , as used for the search for distant quasars .",
    "it can be used as a guidance for future projects , involving the optical identification of comprehensive samples of flat spectrum radio sources , like those in the cosmic lens all sky survey ( class ; myers et al .",
    "since jvas is not complete , a new sample is constructed using selection criteria similar to those of jvas , but with the emphasis on completeness , and with the use of more accurate selection surveys . by comparing this sample with jvas ,",
    "the completeness of jvas is assessed .",
    "this is described in section 2 .",
    "section 3 and 4 describe the apm - poss - i catalogue and the optical identification procedure of jvas and its complete counterpart .",
    "section 5 gives the results and discusses possible relations between optical and radio properties using the complete sample .",
    "the jvas catalogue has been presented in three separate papers , for the regions @xmath12 ( patnaik et al . , 1992 ) , @xmath13 ( browne et al . , 1997 ) , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( wilkinson et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "their initial source list was constructed using the greenbank surveys conducted at 1.4 and 5 ghz by condon & broderick ( 1985 , 1986 ) and condon , broderick & seielstad ( 1989 ) , selecting all sources with spectral indices larger than @xmath16 ( @xmath17 defined as @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 mjy , excluding the region @xmath20 .",
    "the 5 ghz flux densities used to construct the sample were determined directly from the maps and have been found to be systematically higher by @xmath21 than the flux densities determined by gregory and condon ( 87 gb , 1991 ) from the same maps . since the main goal of jvas was to construct a grid of phase calibrator sources , and",
    "the distribution of the sample above contained some undesirable large holes ( @xmath22 ) in some areas , a few additional sources were selected with @xmath23 mjy to fill these holes . where possible , the potential calibrator sources were cross - checked against lower frequency surveys to make sure they had genuine flat spectra . the resulting source list was observed with the vla at 8.4 ghz between 1990 and 1992 ( patnaik et al , 1992 ; browne et al . , 1997 ; wilkinson et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the resulting catalogue includes sources with observed 8.4 ghz peak brightness @xmath24 mjy / beam .    for sources that are in the regions",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath12 the rms position error was estimated to be approximately 10 mas in each coordinate ( patnaik et al . , 1992 ; browne et al . , 1997 ) . for sources in the regions",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 this was estimated to approximately be 40 mas ( wilkinson et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the resulting catalogue contains 2121 radio sources ."

    "<S> however the distinction between galaxies and quasars can not be done properly near the magnitude limit of the poss - i plates . </S>",
    "<S> the identification fraction appears to decrease from @xmath790% for sources with a 5 ghz flux density of @xmath8 , to @xmath980% for sources at 0.2 jy . </S>",
    "<S> the identification fraction , in particular that for unresolved quasars , is found to be lower for sources with steeper radio spectra . in agreement with previous studies , we find that the quasars at low radio flux density levels also tend to have fainter optical magnitudes , although there is a large spread . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , objects with a steep radio - to - optical spectral index are found to be mainly highly polarised quasars , supporting the idea that in these objects the polarised synchrotron component is more prominent . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the large spread in radio - to - optical spectral index is possibly caused by source to source variations in the doppler boosting of the synchrotron component . </S>"
