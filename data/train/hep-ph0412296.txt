    "in 1969 , nambu first presented the string picture for hadrons @xcite . since then , the string theory has provided many interesting ideas in the wide region of the particle physics .",
    "recently , various candidates of multi - quark hadrons ( penta - quarks and tetra - quarks ) have been experimentally observed @xcite . as a remarkable feature of multi - quark hadrons ,",
    "their decay widths are extremely narrow @xcite , which gives an interesting puzzle in the hadron physics . in this paper",
    ", we study the narrow decay width of penta - quark baryons in the qcd string theory @xcite , with referring recent lattice qcd results @xcite .",
    "first , we show the recent lattice qcd studies of the inter - quark potentials in 3q , 4q and 5q systems @xcite , and revisit the color - flux - tube picture for hadrons . for more than 300 different patterns of spatially - fixed 3q systems , we perform accurate and detailed calculations for the 3q potential in su(3 ) lattice qcd with ( @xmath0=5.7 , @xmath1 ) , ( @xmath0=5.8 , @xmath2 ) , ( @xmath0=6.0 , @xmath2 ) and ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , and find that the ground - state 3q potential @xmath5 is well described by the coulomb plus y - type linear potential , i.e. , y - ansatz , @xmath6 within 1%-level deviation @xcite . here , @xmath7 is the minimal value of the total length of the flux - tube , which is y - shaped for the 3q system . to demonstrate this , we show in fig.1(a ) the 3q confinement potential",
    "@xmath8 , i.e. , the 3q potential subtracted by the coulomb part , plotted against the y - shaped flux - tube length @xmath7 . for each @xmath0",
    ", clear linear correspondence is found between the 3q confinement potential @xmath8 and @xmath7 , which indicates y - ansatz for the 3q potential .",
    "furthermore , a clear y - type flux - tube formation is actually observed for the spatially - fixed 3q system in lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "thus , together with recent several other analytical and numerical studies @xcite , y - ansatz for the static 3q potential seems to be almost settled .",
    "this result indicates the color - flux - tube picture for baryons .    ,",

    "( this lattice result presents the proper hamiltonian for the quark - model calculation of the multi - quark systems . ) in fact , the lattice qcd study indicates the color - flux - tube picture even for the multi - quark systems .     for the calculation of the 5q potential @xmath9 .",

    "next , we study the gluonic excitation in lattice qcd @xcite . in the hadron physics ,",
    "the gluonic excitation is one of the interesting phenomena beyond the quark model , and relates to the hybrid hadrons such as @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the valence picture @xcite .    for about 100 different patterns of 3q systems ,",

    "our lattice qcd studies on the various inter - quark potentials indicate the flux - tube picture for hadrons , which is idealized as the qcd string model . here",
    ", we consider penta - quark dynamics , especially for its extremely narrow width , in the qcd string theory .",
    "the ordinary string theory mainly describes open and closed strings corresponding to @xmath14 mesons and glueballs , and has only two types of the reaction process : the string breaking ( or fusion ) process and the string recombination process .    on the other hand ,",
    "the qcd string theory describes also baryons and anti - baryons as the y - shaped flux - tube , which is different from the ordinary string theory .",
    "note that the appearance of the y - type junction is peculiar to the qcd string theory with the su(3 ) color structure .",
    "accordingly , the qcd string theory includes the third reaction process : the junction ( j ) and anti - junction ( @xmath15 ) par creation ( or annihilation ) process .",
    "( through this j-@xmath16 pair creation process , the baryon and anti - baryon pair creation can be described . )      as a remarkable fact in the qcd string theory , the decay / creation process of penta - quark baryons inevitably accompanies the j-@xmath16 creation @xcite as shown in fig.5 . here",
    ", the intermediate state is considered as a gluonic - excited state , since it clearly corresponds to a non - quark - origin excitation @xcite .",
    "the lattice qcd study indicates that such a gluonic - excited state is a highly - excited state with the excitation energy above 1gev .",
    "then , in the qcd string theory , the decay process of the penta - quark baryon near the threshold can be regarded as a quantum tunneling , and therefore the penta - quark decay is expected to be strongly suppressed .",
    "this leads to a very small decay width of penta - quark baryons .",
    "now , we estimate the decay width of penta - quark baryons near the threshold in the qcd string theory . in the quantum tunneling",
    "as shown in fig.5 , the barrier height can be estimated as the gluonic - excitation energy @xmath17 1gev of the intermediate state .",
    "the time scale @xmath18 for the tunneling process is expected to be the hadronic scale as @xmath19 , since @xmath18 can not be smaller than the spatial size of the reaction area due to the causality .",
    "then , the suppression factor for the penta - quark decay can be roughly estimated as @xmath20 note that this suppression factor @xmath21 appears in the decay process of low - lying penta - quarks for both positive- and negative - parity states .",
    "for the decay of @xmath22 into n and k , the decay width would be controlled by the q - value , @xmath23 .",
    "considering the extra suppression factor of @xmath21 , we get a rough order estimate for the decay width of @xmath22 as @xmath24 \\simeq q \\times |\\exp(-\\delta e t)|^2 \\simeq 1 \\sim 10^{-2}{\\rm mev}. $ ]    9 y.  nambu , symmetries and quark models ( wayne state university , 1969 ) ; lecture notes at the copenhagen symposium ( 1970 ) ; phys . rev . *",
