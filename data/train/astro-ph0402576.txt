    "the origin of cosmological gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is still one of the outstanding problems in modern astronomy @xcite . over the past half decade",
    ", the discovery of localized transients in the small error boxes of grbs has led to intense multiwavelength campaigns and many advances have been made in understanding the nature of the bursts and their afterglows throughout the electromagnetic spectrum ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "+ the scenario for the origin of grbs include either the merging of two collapsed objects such as black holes or neutron stars merge @xcite or the cataclysmic destruction of massive stars ( supernovae or hypernovae ) @xcite . in the first scenario ,",
    "grbs can occur long after the star formation episodes in the nucleus since the merging characteristic time scale is as long as @xmath0 1 gyr .",
    "in the second scenario the host galaxies are likely to be on - going significant star formation .",
    "@xcite analyzed the observed offset distribution of gamma - ray burst from their host galaxies , and found a strong connection of grb localization with the uv light of their host galaxies .",
    "this provides a significant observational evidence for the correlations between grbs and star - forming regions .",
    "the characteristics of the physical environment surrounding the bursts may provide strong constrains for the origin of these events . as suggested by @xcite in the collapsar model",
    ", grbs could be produced by rotating massive stars in which the accretion of a helium core leads to the prompt formation of a black hole .",
    "low metallicity in the stellar envelope reduces the mass loss and inhibits the loss of angular momentum by the star .",
    "star formation in regions of low metallicity are likely to generate grbs so that dwarf and sub - luminous galaxies would be preferred host of these events ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "this model is supported by the ly@xmath1 emission from grb host galaxies which show a preference to be metal poor and with on - going star formation in a dust poor environment @xcite .    analyzing the properties of the host galaxies of grbs",
    ", @xcite found that grb host galaxies are sub - luminous in the @xmath2-band and exhibit very blue colors , not comparable to the luminous star - burst and/or reddened sources observed at high redshifts in the infrared and sub - millimeter deep surveys .",
    "there is new evidence that at least some gamma - ray bursts are related to supernovae : the association of grb 980425 with the peculiar type ic sn 1998bw @xcite , and also the recent spectroscopic discovery of the sn 2003dh associated with grb 030329 @xcite .",
    "these observations provide a very solid confirmation of the association of some grbs with the death of massive stars in strong star formation regions .    at the present it is unknown if grb host galaxies",
    "are preferentially located in dense environments , or if there is any correlation between the local density of galaxies and the presence of a grb .",
    "so far , there are only two works on the environment of grb host galaxies . @xcite studying the ly@xmath1 emission of two grb fields ( grb 000301c & grb 000926 ) , found a number of galaxies at the same redshift of grb hosts without signs of overdensity at small scales",
    ". moreover , the lack of blank fields at a similar depth prevented these authors to conclude if grb hosts reside in overdense regions . from an analysis of photometric redshifts of galaxies in the field of grb 000210 , @xcite found that there is no obvious concentration of galaxies around the host .",
    "another case , the afterglow of grb 980613 was located close to a very compact object inside a complex region consisting of star - forming knots and/or interacting galaxy fragments @xcite .",
    "if these host galaxies are associated with the underlying large scale structure of the universe , then they should show similar galaxy clustering properties of normal galaxies .",
    "+ in this paper we examine the nature of the density enhancement of galaxies around grb host galaxies by studying the cross - correlation function between grb hosts and the surrounding galaxy distribution .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the sample of grb host galaxies analyzed , the source extraction and photometry techniques .",
    "we analyze galaxy source counts in section 3 .",
    "section 4 deals with the angular - cross correlation analysis of galaxies around grb host galaxies .",
    "finally we discuss our results in section 5 .",
    "the near - ir data were obtained with the infrared spectrometer and array camera ( isaac ) on the very large telescope ( vlt ) at paranal , ( chile ) between march 2000 and september 2001 under photometric conditions . a @xmath3 filter ( 2.0 - 2.3 @xmath4 ) was used .",
    "the focal lens configurations resulted in a respective pixel size of 0148 .",
    "all the images were obtained under optimum seeing conditions with fwhm in the range 06 and 15 . for the isaac observations",
    ", we reached a total on - source integration time of 1hour per object . a full description of sample selection , observations and image reductions is given in @xcite .",
    "our sample sources is listed in table  [ tab1 ] , together with the position , spectroscopic redshift determinations taken from the literature , the @xmath5band magnitudes of the host galaxies and the 1.5@xmath6 limiting magnitude per field .",
    "+ the optical grbs sample used in this work consist in 19 _ hst_/stis grb host galaxies images .",
    "these observations were taken from hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) stis imaging data from the cycle 9 program go-8640 `` a survey of the host galaxies of gamma - ray bursts '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "images were obtained with the 50ccd filter ( clear , pivot @xmath7=5835  ,  hereafter cl ) and f28x50lp ( long pass , pivot @xmath7=7208  ,  hereafter lp ) .",
    "the data was pre - processed using the standard stis pipeline and combined using the dither ( v2.0 ) software @xcite as implemented in iraf ( v2.11.3 ) and stsdas ( v2.3 ) .",
    "the stis images were drizzled using ` pixfrac=0.6 ' and ` scale=0.5 ' ( giving a final pixel size of 00254 ) .",
    "images were selected for having an optical and/or radio bright afterglow with the deepest observations available in the 50ccd images .",
    "for the stis zero - points , we adopted the values found by @xcite for the hdf@xmath8south in the ab system @xcite .",
    "the zero - points used were therefore zp@xmath9 and zp@xmath10 .",
    "we have measured a psf from the stis images with a fwhm@xmath11 , similar to that obtained by @xcite in the hdf@xmath8s stis analysis .",
    "we adopt this value for images without stars present in the field . _",
    "hst_/stis sources are listed in table  [ tab2 ] , for the 50ccd filter , together with the position , spectroscopic redshift determinations taken from the literature , the cl band magnitudes of the host galaxies , the total on - source exposure time and the 2@xmath6 limiting magnitude per field . +      for object detection and photometry we used the sextractor software package version @xmath12 @xcite . for the isaac images ,",
    "the source extraction parameters were set such that , to be detected , an object must have a flux in excess of @xmath13 times the local background noise level over at least @xmath14 connected pixels , where @xmath14 was varied according to the seeing conditions ( about @xmath1510@xmath815 connected pixels ) .",
    "sextractor s mag_best estimator was used to determine the magnitudes of the sources ; this yields an estimate for the total magnitude using first kron s ( 1980 ) moment algorithm .    in this work",
    "we choose all objects ( galaxies ) with stellaricity index @xmath16 , for the isaac images .",
    "the result of the detection process was inspected visually in order to ensure that no obvious objects were missed , and that no false detections were entered into the catalogs .",
    "saturated objects and objects lying in the image boundaries were rejected from the catalogs .",
    "the final effective field of view is @xmath17 , after spurious detections near boundary regions are rejected .    for the _",
    "hst_/stis images , after extensive tests with sextractor using different input parameters , it became clear that no single set of parameters could satisfy to create a catalog that would reach the faintest depth for isolated objects and faint companions of bright galaxies .",
    "this is a standard problem with sextractor and at the moment an ideal solution does not exists .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite ran sextractor two times with different detection thresholds . in this way , however , it is not easy to achieve consistent estimates of the fluxes with different thresholds . for these reasons ,",
    "we have used a detection threshold corresponding to an isophote of @xmath18 and objects were required a minimum area of 10 connected pixels above this threshold and a stellaricity index @xmath19 , for an object to be a galaxy . after this , spurious objects in correspondence with stellar diffraction spikes and spurious galaxies detected from the spiral arm fragmentation of nearby galaxies were removed from the final catalog .",
    "the final effective field of view for the stis images is @xmath20 .",
    "in order to check for completeness in the sample analyzed , we have computed the mean number of galaxies per unit area for the fields .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "error bars were estimated using poisson counting statistics on the raw galaxy counts . in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "( right panel ) , we compare our determinations with the @xmath3 number counts in the chandra deep field ( cdf ) and in the hubble deep field south ( hdf@xmath8s ) @xcite and with determinations from the ntt deep field @xcite .",
    "we also compare our counts to those of other @xmath2-band surveys from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , as well as from the subaru deep field @xcite .",
    "our @xmath3 number counts derived here are systematically lower than those from the literature , in the range @xmath21 , which could be an indication of lack of many faint galaxies in these grbs fields .",
    "we have also computed the differential galaxy counts in the 50ccd ( cl ) images , ( see figure  [ fig1 ] , left panel ) .",
    "error bars were estimated using poissonian errors .",
    "we compare our determinations with the 50ccd number counts from hdf - s stis imaging @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "we plot the wfpc2 hdf - n galaxy counts in @xmath22 from @xcite from @xcite , from the hdf@xmath8s and hdf@xmath8n and in f450w from @xcite . these results are fully consistent with those in the literature .",
    "in this section we analyze the clustering of galaxies around grb host galaxies .",
    "we compute the angular two point cross - correlation function @xmath23 between the grb host galaxies and the galaxies in their fields for the isaac near - ir images and for the _",
    "hst_/stis images ( tracer galaxies ) .",
    "we have used the following estimator of the angular cross - correlation function ,",
    "@xcite :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the numbers of galaxies in the sample and in a random sample respectively , @xmath27 is the number of real pairs host - galaxy separated by an angular distance in the range @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the corresponding pairs when considering the random galaxy sample .",
    "we have also computed the auto - correlation function of the tracer galaxies in all fields analyzed which serves to compare the relative clustering strength around grb hosts , and around typical galaxies .",
    "we estimate correlation function error bars using the field - to - field variation : @xmath30 ^ 2\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath31 stands for each individual frame .",
    "the field - to - field errors are @xmath32 standard deviations of the correlation function between fields , and are inverse variance - weighted to account for the different numbers of sources on each field .",
    "@xcite conclude that these variations provide suitable estimates of correlation uncertainties accounting for cosmic variance and differences of image photometric zero - point calibrations .",
    "the finite area of the images implies a systematic amplitude offset known as the integral constraint @xmath33 , such that @xmath34 .",
    "the integral constraint can be computed numerically using a random - random sample :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the number of random pairs of objects with angular distances between @xmath37 and @xmath38 . for our sample geometry , and assuming @xmath39 , we find @xmath40 , for isaac images and @xmath41 for _ hst_/stis images .",
    "+ in figure  [ vlt1 ] and  [ vlt2 ] we show the resulting host - galaxy two - point cross - correlation functions for three samples of tracer galaxies : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 in the isaac images .",
    "these magnitudes limits are consistently with the k@xmath8 band photometry and spectroscopic redshifts determinations of field galaxies ( see figure 2 in @xcite ) . in the same figures",
    "we have computed the auto - correlations functions of the tracer galaxies in the same magnitudes range .",
    "the amplitude of the auto - cross correlation function is @xmath45 , for the all tracer galaxies sample with @xmath42 ; and @xmath46 for tracers galaxies with @xmath44 .",
    "we have also performed this computation for the _",
    "hst_/stis images which are shown in figure [ fig5 ] . in this figure",
    "we can appreciate the host - galaxy cross - correlation function in the 50ccd images for tracer galaxies with @xmath47 around all host galaxies quoted in table  [ tab2 ] ( filled triangles ) .",
    "+ we have also explored different intervals of magnitudes and the effect on the results of excluding hosts that are either too distant ( @xmath48 ) , or relatively close ( @xmath49 ) in order to avoid very faint galaxy images and large angular scales . in figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we show the resulting host - galaxy cross - correlation functions for tracer galaxies with @xmath47 around host galaxies with spectroscopic redshift determinations in the range @xmath50 ( filled circles ) .",
    "the amplitude of the auto - cross correlation function is @xmath51 , for the all tracer galaxies sample with @xmath47 ; and @xmath52 for tracers galaxies around grb host galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the range @xmath50 in the same magnitude range .    in this figure",
    "we have not included grb 990705 , because this grb host is located behind the outskirts of the large magellanic cloud ( lcm ) and it is expected a stronger contamination in the sextractor point source identification .",
    "we can see here that there is not a significant grb host - galaxy cross - correlation amplitude . in similar analyzes , @xcite ,",
    "found that radio galaxies and ultra steep spectrum radio sources with comparable redshifts than our grb sample ( @xmath53 ) . show significant cross - correlations with neighboring galaxies ( shown as dotted and dashed lines in figure  [ vlt1 ] , right panel ) indicating that these sources are likely to reside in proto - cluster environments .",
    "by contrast , the lack of a cross - correlation signal in our grb fields provides clear evidence that the neighborhood of grb hosts is of significant lower galaxy overdensity than groups and clusters .",
    "this is reinforced by the fact that grb - galaxy cross - correlations have a lower amplitude than the galaxy auto - correlation function in these fields for the two limiting magnitudes analyzed .",
    "we have restricted to tracer galaxies beyond an angular radius @xmath54 from the host .",
    "we adopt this value to avoid the numerous knots or galaxy fragments , observed in some host complex systems and the surrounding galaxies .",
    "it can be appreciated in these figures a significant anti - correlation signal between grb hosts and surrounding galaxies , indicating that grb hosts reside in regions strongly biased to low local galaxy densities .",
    "+ we have also tested for possible bias in the detection of objects near the edges of the frames of grbs images .",
    "we have computed auto - correlation analysis for objects with @xmath55 for the issac images and those with @xmath56 for the _",
    "hst_/stis images , identified in our images as point sources ( stars ) .",
    "we find that stars are uncorrelated on the sky , as shown in figure [ starvlt ] for @xmath57 .",
    "we find similar values for @xmath47 and @xmath58 in the _",
    "hst_/stis images .",
    "the lack of signal for these samples indicates the absence of significant systematic effects in our analysis .",
    "+ in order to compare these results with galaxy samples with well determined characteristics , we have computed the angular cross - correlation analysis between star - forming galaxies , early - type galaxies , infrared galaxies ( iso sources ) , and tracer galaxies in the hubble deep field north .",
    "+ for this purpose , we have considered blue spiral and irregular galaxies from @xcite with @xmath59 @xmath60 0.7 .",
    "the sample of ellipticals was selected from @xcite .",
    "the infrared selected galaxies was selected from isocam observations in the hubble deep field @xcite .",
    "all sources were selected in the redshift range of 0.5 @xmath61 1.2 .",
    "hdf tracer galaxies correspond to @xcite , extracted in the f606w filter .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  [ sfr ] , for tracer galaxies with f606w @xmath60 27 .",
    "we estimate correlation function error bars using uncertainties derived from the bootstrap re - sampling techniques .",
    "we find a low cross - correlation amplitude at small angular scales , similar to those obtained in our _ hst_/stis images , in comparison to bright early - types galaxies and iso sources in the same redshift range ( see figure  [ sfr ] ) .",
    "we have analyzed different data sets corresponding to deep imaging in the field of gamma - ray burst hosts .",
    "a remarkable low correlation amplitude at small angular scales is detected from the cross - correlation of grb s and the surrounding galaxies in all samples analyzed .",
    "the reliability of the results presented in this work can be judged from the lack of correlation of stars in isaac and _ hst_/stis images . by contrast",
    ", the galaxy - galaxy correlation function obeys the usual power - law shape with a significant signal at small separations . given that these correlation functions were computed using angular positions , any effect in real space would be diluted by projection of foreground and background objects .",
    "a comparison with a similar data set , centered in uss sources , indicates the very different environment of these two types of objects . while uss sources clearly reside in rich environments , grbs are likely to reside in a typical or even lower galaxy density environment . moreover the amplitude of the autocorrelation function of galaxies is larger than that of the grb - galaxy cross - correlation .    in the _",
    "hst_/stis fields grb - tracers cross - correlation functions are significantly lower than early - type - tracers cross correlations .",
    "in addition , grb targets have a lower cross correlation amplitude than iso and early - type galaxy targets .",
    "this suggests that the star formation events associated to grbs occur in particularly low density environments , a result that is supported by the fact that objects formed in global underdense regions are expected to be biased to low luminosity , consistent with grb hosts characteristics @xcite .",
