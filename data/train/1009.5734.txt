    "in this paper we consider the _ capacitated _ survivable network design problem ( cap - sndp ) .",
    "the input consists of an undirected @xmath14-vertex multi - graph @xmath15 and an integer requirement @xmath16 for each unordered pair of nodes @xmath17 .",
    "each edge @xmath18 of @xmath19 has a cost @xmath20 and an integer capacity @xmath21 .",
    "the goal is to find a minimum - cost subgraph @xmath22 of @xmath19 such that for each pair of nodes @xmath23 the capacity of the minimum - cut between @xmath24 and @xmath25 in @xmath22 is at least @xmath16 .",
    "this generalizes the well - known survivable network design problem ( sndp ) problem in which all edge capacities are @xmath26 .",
    "sndp already captures as special cases a variety of fundamental connectivity problems in combinatorial optimization such as the min - cost spanning tree , min - cost steiner tree and forest , as well as min - cost @xmath4-edge - connected subgraph ; each of these problems has been extensively studied on its own and several of these special cases are np - hard and apx - hard to approximate .",
    "jain , in an influential paper @xcite , obtained a @xmath27-approximation for sndp via the standard cut - based lp relaxation using the iterated rounding technique .",
    "although the above mentioned @xmath27-approximation for sndp has been known since 1998 , the approximability of cap - sndp has essentially been wide open even in very restricted special cases . similar to sndp , cap - sndp",
    "is motivated by both practial and theoretical considerations .",
    "these problems find applications in the design of resilient networks such as in telecommunication infrastructure .",
    "in such networks it is often quite common to have equipment with different discrete capacities ; this leads naturally to design problems such as cap - sndp . at the outset ,",
    "we mention that a different and somewhat related problem is also referred to by the same name , especially in the operations research literature . in this version the subgraph @xmath22 has to support _ simultaneously _ a flow of @xmath16 between each pair of nodes @xmath17 ; this is more closely related to multicommodity flows and buy - at - bulk network design .",
    "our version is more related to connectivity problems such as sndp .    as far as we are aware , the version of cap - sndp that we study was introduced ( in the approximation algorithms literature ) by goemans _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in conjunction with their work on sndp .",
    "they made several observations on cap - sndp : ( i ) cap - sndp reduces to sndp if all capacities are the same , ( ii ) there is an @xmath28 approximation where @xmath1 is the number of edges in @xmath19 and @xmath29 is the maximum requirement , and ( iii ) if _ multiple _ copies of an edge are allowed then there is an @xmath30-approximation .",
    "we note that in the capacitated case @xmath12 can be exponentially large in @xmath14 , the number of nodes of the graph .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite observed that the natural cut - based lp relaxation has an unbounded integrality gap even for the graph consisting of only two nodes @xmath31 connected by parallel edges with different capacities .",
    "motivated by this observation and the goal of obtaining improved approximation ratios for cap - sndp , @xcite strengthened the basic cut - based lp by using _",
    "knapsack - cover _ inequalities .",
    "( several subsequent papers in approximation algorithms have fruitfully used these inequalities . ) using these inequalities , @xcite obtained a @xmath32 approximation for cap - sndp where @xmath33 is the maximum cardinality of a _ bond _ in the underlying simple graph : a bond is a minimal set of edges that separates some pair of vertices with positive demand .",
    "although @xmath33 could be @xmath34 in general , for certain topologies  for instance , if the underlying graph is a line or a cycle  this gives constant factor approximations .",
    "the above results naturally lead to several questions . what is the approximability of cap - sndp ? should we expect a poly - logarithmic approximation or even a constant factor approximation ? if not , what are interesting and useful special cases to consider ? and do the knapsack cover inequalities help in the general case ?",
    "what is the approximability of cap - sndp if one allows multiple copies ?",
    "does this relaxed version of the problem allow a constant factor approximation ?    in this paper",
    "we obtain several new positive and negative results for cap - sndp that provide new insights into the questions above .    in this paper",
    ", we also study the so called _ soft capacity _ version of cap - sndp .",
    "in this version , each edge @xmath18 can be bought any number of times ; that is , one can pay cost @xmath35 to get a capacity of @xmath36 , for any positive integer @xmath10 .",
    "such a variant is natural in some application settings ; for example , one may be able to simultaneously lay down multiple copies of a telecommunications cable across two nodes .",
    "we will sometimes call the original version of the problem one with _ hard _ capacities , when we want to make a distinction between the two versions .",
    "we first discuss results for cap - sndp where multiple copies are not allowed .",
    "we initiate our study by considering the _ global connectivity _ version of cap - sndp where we want a min - cost subgraph with global min - cut at least @xmath3 ; in other words , there is a `` uniform '' requirement @xmath37 for _ all _ pairs @xmath17 .",
    "we refer to this as the _ _ problem ; the special case when all capacities are unit corresponds to the classical minimum cost @xmath4-edge - connected ( spanning ) subgraph problem , which is known to be apx - hard @xcite .",
    "we show the following positive result for arbitrary capacities .",
    "[ thm : uniform ] there is a randomized @xmath2-approximation algorithm for the problem .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath38 , there is a randomized @xmath39-approximation algorithm with running time @xmath40 for `` nearly uniform '' cap - sndp when all pairwise requirements are in @xmath41 $ ] .    to prove theorem [ thm : uniform ] , we begin with a natural lp relaxation for the problem .",
    "almost all positive results previously obtained for the unit capacity case are based on this relaxation . as remarked already",
    ", this lp has an unbounded integrality gap even for a graph with two nodes ( and hence for ) .",
    "we strengthen the relaxation by adding the valid knapsack cover inequalities .",
    "although we do not know of a polynomial time algorithm to separate over these inequalities , following @xcite , we find a violated inequality _ only if _ the current fractional solution does not satisfy certain useful properties .",
    "our main technical tool both for finding a violated inequality and subsequently rounding the fractional solution is karger s theorem on the number of small cuts in undirected graphs @xcite .",
    "we believe the approach outlined above may be useful in other network design applications . as a concrete illustration , we use it to solve an interesting and natural generalization of , namely , the _ _ problem .",

    "the _ capacity _ of an @xmath24-way cut @xmath48 is the total capacity of edges in @xmath50 . ]",
    "it is easy to see that is precisely the , with @xmath51 .",
    "note that the problem is not a special case of the general cap - sndp as the cut requirements for the former problem are not expressible as pairwise connectivity constraints .",
    "interestingly , our techniques for can be naturally extended to handle the multiway cut requirements , yielding the following generalization of theorem  [ thm : uniform ] .",
    "[ thm : kway ] there is a randomized @xmath52-approximation algorithm for the problem with @xmath53 running time .",
    "we remark that even for the unit - capacity case of this problem , it is not clear how to obtain a better ratio than that guaranteed by the above theorem .",
    "we discuss more in section  [ subsec : kway ] .",
    "once the pairwise connectivity requirements are allowed to vary arbitrarily , the cap - sndp problem seems to become distinctly harder .",
    "surprisingly , the difficulty of the general case starts to manifest even for the simplest representative problem in this setting , where there is only one pair @xmath5 with @xmath54 ; we refer to this as the _ single pair _ problem .",
    "the only known positive result for this seemingly restricted case is a polynomial - factor approximation that follows from the results in @xcite for general cap - sndp . we give several negative results to suggest that this special case may capture the essential difficulty of cap - sndp . in particular , we start by observing that the lp with knapsack cover inequalities has an @xmath6 integrality gap even for the single - pair problem .. however , no example is given ; it is not clear if the gap applied to a single pair instance or if @xmath33 could be as large as @xmath14 in the construction . ]",
