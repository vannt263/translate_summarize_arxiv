    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) has been subject to a vast amount of study during the past decades .",
    "our ignorance of the mechanism of supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking as well as the messenger mechanism allows for a large number of free parameters and therefore different experimental signatures of supersymmetric models ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "detailed studies regarding the concrete low energy spectrum and interactions have to be performed on very specific models .",
    "a handful of benchmark points were chosen @xcite in order to extract low energy implications that can be eventually contrasted with experiment .",
    "it is however desirable to have a top - down derivation of soft supersymmetry breaking terms , obtained from a fundamental theory such as string theory .",
    "this would provide a more robust theoretical motivation for selecting particular benchmark points .    until recently this task was not fully possible because there were no explicit derivations of soft susy breaking terms from string theory ( see , for example , @xcite ) . even though some general scenarios were identified , such as dilaton and moduli domination , there were no proper models in which all moduli were stabilised after susy breaking .",
    "dramatic progress has been achieved in recent years regarding moduli stabilisation in flux compactifications . in the type iib context",
    "these have been investigated in detail , with the result that a large class of moduli are stabilised by turning on fluxes of antisymmetric tensor fields .",
    "the remaining moduli , including the volume of the compact space , can be stabilised by nonperturbative effects , such as in the kklt mechanism @xcite and related generalisations .",
    "studies of soft susy breaking terms from fluxes were performed recently by several groups @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological implications were explored in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , these studies , while fixing all the complex structure moduli and the dilaton , did not stabilise the volume - like moduli . in the kklt scenario the rest of the moduli",
    "are stabilised but the effect of susy breaking by fluxes is washed out by nonperturbative effects .",
    "the source of susy breaking is then the least understood part of the scenario corresponding to the introduction of explicit soft breaking from anti d3 branes .",
    "furthermore , in this scenario , it has not been possible to perform a proper analysis of soft terms in concrete models due to technical complications in the stabilisation process . a phenomenological analysis of models inspired by the kklt scenario was recently performed in @xcite .",
    "fortunately , a generalisation of the kklt scenario was constructed recently @xcite , henceforth referred to as the large volume scenario , in which , for half of the calabi - yau compactifications , all moduli are stabilised .",
    "the salient feature of these models is that the calabi - yau volume is generically exponentially large , allowing for a range of values for the string scale ( from tev to the gut scale ) .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the kklt case in which the volume has only a logarithmic dependence on flux parameters and it is difficult to obtain a weakly coupled ( large volume ) model .",
    "another important feature is that only one of the k \" ahler moduli is stabilised at a large value , whereas all others are . ]",
    "@xmath4 in ref .",
    "@xcite , masses of both bulk and brane moduli were explicitly computed .",
    "the moduli masses are dependent on two parameters - the calabi - yau volume , @xmath5 , which is expected to be large , and the flux superpotential @xmath6 which is generically @xmath7 furthermore , unlike the original kklt version , the @xmath8 expansion allows for explicit control of the calculation of the soft breaking terms .",
    "these were derived in ref .",
    "@xcite for the calabi - yau compactifications that admit the exponentially large volume minimum .    in this article",
    "we make a study of the phenomenological implications of the different scenarios that emerge from this general class of string compactifications .",
    "we will identify three semi - realistic scenarios as follows .    1",
    ".   _ generalised fluxed mssm . _",
    "if the standard model lies on d7 branes , the discrete input parameters allow for string scales between the intermediate @xmath9gev and the gut scales .",
    "the models generically suffer from the cosmological moduli problem and smaller string scales ( @xmath10gev ) tend to lead to a stop lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) instead of a neutralino . to leading order in @xmath8 expansion , the gut scale case reproduces the fluxed mssm @xcite .",
    "intermediate scale split susy .",
    "_ if the standard model lives on a set of d3 branes , the scalar masses are naturally many orders of magnitude heavier than gaugino masses and for an intermediate string scale gaugino masses are of order tev .",
    "standard fine tuning is then needed to keep the higgs light as in the split supersymmetry scenario .",
    "thus we provide a stringy realisation of split susy .",
    "stringy msugra .",
    "_ tuning the value of the flux superpotential @xmath6 it is possible to obtain a string scale of order the gut scale and all soft - breaking terms of the same order as in the standard msugra scenario .",
    "again , this provides a stringy realisation of this popular scenario .    in each case",
    "we perform an rg flow to low energies and impose phenomenological constraints from dark matter , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . since the third scenario has been largely explored , we only provide detailed analysis for models within the first two scenarios , selecting benchmark points in which the full low - energy spectrum is computed . in the rest of the article",
    "we describe each of these scenarios , starting with a brief overview of the results in @xcite .",
    "here we will mention the relevant properties of the kklt / large volume compactifications that will be needed for the analysis of soft breaking terms .",
    "type iib string models have the following bosonic spectrum of massless fields in 10d : the metric @xmath11 , two rank - two antisymmetric tensors @xmath12 , a complex dilaton / axion scalar @xmath13 and a rank - four antisymmetric tensor with self - dual field strength . a typical string compactification is determined by the following procedure :    * first turn on a background value of the metric to split the spacetime into our 4d spacetime and six extra compact dimensions which are taken to be a calabi - yau orientifold in order to preserve @xmath14 supersymmetry in 4d .",
    "the calabi - yau space is characterised by the number of two - cycles and their dual four - cycles , as well as the number of three - cycles .",
    "the sizes of these cycles are in general arbitrary .",
    "they define the khler structure moduli @xmath15 for the size of the four and two cycles and complex structure moduli @xmath16 for the size of the three cycles .",
    "these moduli correspond to the internal components of the metric which in the 4d effective field theory appear as a set of massless scalar fields , clearly in contradiction with experiment .",
    "fixing the vacuum expectation value of these fields while providing them a mass is the problem of moduli stabilisation in string theory .",
    "* turning on the other bosonic fields in the spectrum helps stabilise the complex structure moduli by the standard requirement of flux quantisation of the field strength of rank - two antisymmetric tensors .",
    "this also fixes the vacuum expectation values of the dilaton / axion field .",
    "fluxes modify the geometry but in type iib string theory the remnant space is a warped calabi - yau which is conformally equivalent to a calabi - yau .",
    "therefore the usual properties of calabi - yau spaces can still be used in flux compactifications .",
    "this is not the case for the other string theories , such as the type iia or heterotic string .",
    "* these models generically have d - branes .",
    "d3 and d7 branes can be introduced while preserving supersymmetry .",
    "these play an important role because it is on the d - branes that the standard model can live .",
    "branes can not be introduced arbitrarily because of consistency ( tadpole cancellation ) conditions requiring the total charge of a given d - brane type to vanish due to the compactness of the internal manifold .",
    "we can consider the standard model matter being on either the d7 or d3 branes .",
    "there can also be hidden sector d3/d7 branes .",
    "these can induce non - perturbative superpotentials for the @xmath17 fields ( @xmath18 ) , completing the geometric moduli stabilisation process .",
    "other moduli , corresponding to the position of the d7 branes within the calabi - yau manifold , can also be determined by the combined flux and non - perturbative superpotentials . *",
    "the previous procedure usually fixes the moduli with a negative value of the cosmological constant .",
    "there are several proposals for lifting the minimum of the scalar potential to a zero or positive vacuum energy , such as the inclusion of anti d3 branes @xcite , d - terms @xcite , iasd fluxes @xcite , etc .",
    "only after all moduli have been stabilised is a vacuum obtained for which the physical properties of the particles ( in particular the soft susy breaking terms ) in the spectrum may be analysed .",
    "therefore , phenomenological analysis relies heavily on moduli stabilisation . in the past",
    ", it was simply assumed that moduli were stabilised , without providing a mechanism .    in the kklt scenario and recent modifications moduli stabilisation",
    "is possible .",
    "we will consider the large volume scenario described in the introduction since it allows for explicit minima of the scalar potential at large enough volumes to trust the effective field theory treatment .",
    "an important property of this scenario is that , contrary to the kklt case , the main source of supersymmetry breaking are the fluxes and not the _ ad hoc _ introduction of anti d3 branes or d - terms .",
    "the input parameters are :    1 .   the flux superpotential @xmath6 .",
    "it depends on combinations of integers determined by the fluxes .",
    "statistically it can take any value but very small values ( @xmath19 ) are difficult to obtain .",
    "this is usually described as ` fine - tuning ' of flux superpotentials .",
    "2 .   the string coupling constant @xmath20 .",
    "this corresponds to the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the dilaton field @xmath21 and it is determined by the fluxes .",
    "values of order @xmath22 are easy to obtain .",
    "3 .   the volume of the calabi - yau @xmath5 which is a combination of the @xmath15 moduli .",
    "it is determined primarily by an exponential dependence on the rank of the hidden sector gauge group and the string coupling constant .",
    "warp factors of the metric at the location of the d branes .",
    "these play a role in tuning the minimum to de sitter space .",
    "they may also play a role in redshifting scales in the standard model brane .    the string scale and the gravitino mass",
    "are determined in terms of @xmath6 and @xmath5 by @xmath23 respectively . here",
    "@xmath20 denotes the string coupling and @xmath24gev is the reduced planck mass .",
    "d3masstable ] shows the dependence of d3 soft terms on @xmath6 and @xmath25    .soft terms for d3 branes ( amsb contributions not included).[d3masstable ] [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in the heavy scalar scenario , for @xmath26gev , @xmath27gev and @xmath28gev , @xmath29gev . ]",
    "the second case is that of a heavy higgsino being the lsp . in this case",
    "the relic abundance is @xmath30    scenarios with @xmath31 slightly above @xmath32gev can realise this possibility , since then the bino has mass above @xmath33gev . with a @xmath34-term chosen to be @xmath35tev at the string scale @xmath36 , it is possible to obtain the correct relic abundance . for example , with @xmath37gev and @xmath38 we have ( at scale @xmath39 ) @xmath40gev , @xmath41gev , @xmath42gev whereas @xmath43gev .",
    "the last possibility is that of a wino lsp and relic abundance @xmath44 however , this can not be realised in our scenarios , since the wino is always heavier than the bino .",
    "we note that the string scale is independent of the flux superpotential parameter @xmath6 , whereas all the soft terms are directly proportional to it .",
    "therefore we can take @xmath45gev , put all the matter on d3 branes and lower the value of @xmath6 to obtain realistic values for the scalar masses and other soft parameters .",
    "note that the gravitino mass will also be lowered in this process , and its size will be roughly just one order of magnitude above the scalar masses",
    ". we must be careful for a number of reasons , since lowering @xmath6 means lowering the magnitude of supersymmetry breaking in the nonsusy ads minimum of @xcite .",
    "therefore the d - term contribution to susy breaking might become significant compared to the f - term contributions .",
    "however , this is not the case since both d and f - terms are proportional to the value of @xmath46    therefore , we have two parameters to control - @xmath5 and @xmath46 increasing @xmath5 decreases the string scale , while decreasing @xmath6 decreases the soft terms only ( since the amount of supersymmetry breaking is reduced ) .",
    "however , the only reasonable scenarios with scalar masses of @xmath47 will arise from the scenario with string scale @xmath48gev and appropriately reduced @xmath46 the string scale can not be reduced any further , since that would entail increasing @xmath49 significantly and the ratio of gaugino to scalar masses would become very small , leading back to the split susy scenario .",
    "one could also consider d3 or d7 branes in a warped region , so that the warp factor reduces the scalar masses to a small value .",
    "this however also reduces the value of the string scale to a smaller value .",
    "the resulting small gap between the scalar mass scale and the string scale makes it difficult to achieve unification at the string scale - one needs a large amount of extra matter . for example , if the string scale is lowered to @xmath50 gev , one needs at least 14 new multiplets , and with the string scale at @xmath51gev , one needs 51 .",
    "the construction of string models in which this type of scenarios can be realised is open .",
    "we have presented three distinctive scenarios of low - energy supersymmetry breaking which were derived from string compactifications .",
    "it is very appealing to be able go such a long way - from a string theory compactification with fluxes to computing the spectrum at low energy of specific models .",
    "it is also illustrative to see how difficult it is to obtain fully realistic scenarios given the many cosmological and phenomenological constraints .",
    "the three scenarios we studied have several interesting properties and represent a progress in the right direction to close the gap between string theory and low - energy physics .",
    "in particular the detailed spectrum of supersymmetric particles was obtained at low - energies for representative examples .",
    "each of the scenarios has potential problems which illustrate the difficulties that can be expected in general .",
    "the generalised fluxed mssm scenario , despite its interesting features , has to face the cosmological moduli problem which appears at every value of the string scale , as mentioned in the text .",
    "we would have to rely on a solution of this problem in order to consider this scenario to be fully realistic .",
    "notice that this potential problem could not have been envisioned in the original discussion of soft supersymmetry breaking induced by fluxes since there was no mechanism to fix the khler structure moduli . also , for scales lower than @xmath0gev the stop is the lsp instead of a neutralino .",
    "barring these problems we found that the parameter space is greatly reduced by the standard phenomenological constraints .",
    "the case @xmath52 is not compatible with the boundary condition for the @xmath53 term , while for @xmath54gev only low @xmath55 solutions exist and the higgs mass is below the lep2 bound .",
    "this problem may be alleviated by relaxing the @xmath53 term boundary condition , e.g. by considering the higgs coming from d3-d7 strings .",
    "our lack of control of the khler potential for these fields does not allow us to make a concrete statement about this possibility .",
    "the intermediate scale split supersymmetry scenario needs the usual fine tuning in order to keep the higgs light . again",
    "the d3-d7 particles could alleviate this problem if their masses were under control .",
    "furthermore , despite sharing with the split supersymmetry scenario the property that the scalars are hierarchically heavier than the gauginos , it has to be pointed out that in our scenario the string scale is intermediate and therefore we do not expect the standard mssm gauge coupling unification to work .    the stringy msugra scenario requires a tuning of the flux superpotential in order to achieve a gut string scale .",
    "this tuning however may be argued to be less severe than the tuning of the split supersymmetry that needs to be made at the spectrum level , although both rely on the existence of many flux vacua .",
    "notice that in the stringy msugra scenario , without knowing any relationship among the relative coefficients , we can only estimate the order of magnitude of the soft breaking terms .",
    "it is fair to say also that each of the phenomenological constraints we have used may be relaxed and the parameter space of realistic models can be substantially enhanced .",
    "for example , non - universal flavour structure in the soft susy breaking terms can cancel the supersymmetric contribution to br@xmath56 .",
    "also , evidence for a non - standard model component of @xmath2 is controversial and may turn out to not be relevant . similarly",
    ", dark matter could all reside in the hidden sector and the lsp could be unstable",
    ".    it is interesting to compare our results with the phenomenology of kklt - type scenarios .",
    "the essential difference is that the large volume minima we found are non - supersymmetric even before the lifting term is added . in kklt scenarios ,",
    "supersymmetry is restored after fixing the k \" ahler moduli , so it is precisely the anti d3 brane term which is responsible for supersymmetry breaking .",
    "of course , the uplift gives non - zero values to f - terms as well , but these will be parametrised in terms of the uplift potential .",
    "in fact it turns out @xcite that they are significantly suppressed with respect to the no - scale model values .",
    "this implies that , for example , the moduli mediated contribution to the d7 scalar masses is suppressed with respect to @xmath57 and will generically compete with the amsb contribution .",
    "the same is true for gaugino masses , where it turns out that it is possible to obtain a ` mirage unification ' at the intermediate or even tev scale by combining the two contributions @xcite .",
    "there were no realistic scenarios for d3 soft terms in that scenario .",
    "finally , it is worth pointing out that what we have analysed here are general scenarios assuming that the standard model is on d3 or d7 branes . in order to be more concrete",
    "it would be desirable to carry out this kind of analysis on explicit d - brane models , taking into account potential matter and gauge fields beyond the mssm , etc .",
    "there are clearly many things to be done in this direction .",
    "explicit model building may become more focused after data from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) arrives .",
    "we would like to thank cliff burgess , joseph conlon and luis ibez for useful conversations .",
    "we also thank gordon kane and piyush kumar for comments on an earlier version of the paper .",
    "this research is partially funded by pparc .",
    "fq is also funded by a royal society wolfson award .",
    "ks is grateful to trinity college , cambridge for financial support .",
    "let us consider the general formula for the gaugino mass in models with both moduli and anomaly mediated susy breaking , as derived in @xcite : @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the dynkin index for the adjoint representation , @xmath60 is the one - loop gauge beta function coefficient and @xmath61 is the dynkin index associated with the representation @xmath62 of dimension @xmath63 , equal to @xmath64 for the @xmath65 fundamental ; a sum over all the matter representations @xmath62 is understood in each term with the @xmath62 subindex .",
    "@xmath66 is the k \" ahler potential , @xmath67 its second derivatives with respect to matter fields projected onto the corresponding representation of @xmath68 , and the f - terms are defined as ] @xmath69 with @xmath70 the superpotential .",
    "the first term in equation ( [ amsbgaugino ] ) is the usual super - weyl anomaly induced term present in any supergravity theory .",
    "the second and third terms arise from k \" ahler and sigma - model anomalies .    for simplicity let us consider the case of a single k \" ahler modulus model .",
    "let us assume that the k \" ahler potential is of the no - scale form , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the matter field .",
    "taking derivatives with respect to matter fields , one gets the result for a particular representation @xmath62 @xmath73 assuming that the vevs of visible matter vanish . hence from formula ( [ amsbgaugino ] )",
    "we get @xmath74 in no - scale models susy breaking corresponds to nonzero values of the auxiliary field corresponding to @xmath75 the gravitino mass is equal to @xmath76 also @xmath77 assuming that @xmath15 is absent from the superpotential .",
    "therefore we have @xmath78 it can easily be checked that this result generalises to the @xmath79-k \" ahler modulus case , due to the no - scale property @xmath80 with @xmath81 ranging over all k \" ahler moduli .",
    "it follows from equation ( [ gaugmass ] ) that the amsb contribution to gaugino masses is vanishing .",
