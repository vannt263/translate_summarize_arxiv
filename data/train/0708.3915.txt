    "radio galaxies and quasars produce powerful relativistic plasma jets , accelerating particles up to tev energies .",
    "jets are not unique to agn , but are also observed in other objects like in x - ray binaries , micro - quasars , young stellar objects and probably also in gamma - ray bursters . in modern theory ,",
    "the launching and acceleration of the relativistic jets is explained via mhd processes , with magnetic fields either attached to the rotating accretion disk or directly linked to the ergosphere of the central and possibly rotating super - massive black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in order to better understand the process of jet formation , a study of the inner most regions of compact radio sources is necessary .",
    "vlbi at short millimeter wavelengths ( mm - vlbi ) provides , via its unrivaled angular resolution of only a few ten micro - arcseconds ( at @xmath1 mm ) , an almost unique tool to test and discriminate between the different theoretical models .",
    "in addition to the high spatial resolution ( corresponding to @xmath2 schwarzschild radii for nearby sources like sgra * or m87 ) , the high observing frequency allows to image emission regions , which are self - absorbed and therefore not observable at longer wavelengths .    in the following",
    "we present some results from global 3mm - vlbi performed with the global millimeter vlbi array ( gmva ) at 86ghz .",
    "vlbi observations at shorter wavelengths ( @xmath3 mm , @xmath4ghz ) are possible but are still limited by the number of available mm - telescopes ( typically @xmath5 ) , their sensitivity and the limited observing bandwidth ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . to date , it is therefore not yet possible to produce a reliable map of a radio source at these shorter wavelengths .",
    "the gmva combines the sensitive and mm - capable telescopes in europe ( 100 m effelsberg , 6x15 m plateau de bure , 30 m pico veleta , 20 m onsala , & 14 m metshovi ) with the vlba .",
    "the gmva is open to the scientific community and calls for observing proposals twice per year ( proposal deadlines : feb .",

    "it enables imaging of compact radio sources at an angular resolution of @xmath7as .",
    "the transatlantic detection sensitivity ( @xmath8 ) ranges between @xmath9mjy on the most sensitive baselines ( for 512mbps ) .",
    "this should be compared with the @xmath10mjy baseline sensitivity of the stand - alone vlba . in a typical 12hr gmva observing run , an image rms of @xmath11mjy is reached .    .",
    "vlbi surveys at 86ghz : col.1 gives the reference , col.2 the number of antennas , col.3 the typical detection sensitivity ( @xmath8 ) in [ jy ] , col.4 the number of observed sources and col.5 the percentage of detected objects ( detection rate ) .
