    "during the last century einstein gravity ( eg ) was one of the corner stones of theoretical physics . despite of the success in explanation of various gravitational phenomena in nature",
    ", there are some unsolved basic problems such as singularity problem , black hole physics , and most importantly quantum theory of gravity .",
    "there was an enormous effort in these lines to solve such problems but up to now , it has not been obtained a complete theory of gravity .",
    "one of such alternative theories of gravity is conformal gravity(cg ) @xcite . according to @xcite conformal gravity which is an elegant theory because of its lagrangian constructed by weyl tensor as a unique lagrangian . on the other hand",
    ", it is an important theory from phenomenological view point because of its scale symmetry relation to property of renormalizability , also it is intrested in some observational evidence such as , description of background effects of galactic rotation curve in the story of dark matter is discussed by mannheim and kazanas in @xcite .",
    "intuitively , beside of local lorentz symmetry , it also has an scaling symmetry in which the physics is invariant under changing the scale of the metric as @xmath0 a detailed introduction on conformal gravity is described in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ( [ metric ] ) , we introduce the local solution of a neutral rotating black hole in pure conformal gravity .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is calculating the thermodynamical quantities for this type of black holes .",
    "black hole thermodynamics emerged from the classical general relativistic laws of black hole mechanics , summarized by bardeen - carter - hawking , together with the physical insights by bekenstein about black hole entropy @xcite and the semiclassical derivation by hawking of black hole evaporation .",
    "all the results that had been obtained from 1963 to 1973 culminated in the famous four laws of black hole mechanics by bardeen et al .",
    "@xcite ; therefor , in section ( [ thermodynamic ] ) , we obtain the thermodynamical quantities .",
    "we calculate some details in evaluating the temperature , entropy and angular momentum , for the case black hole of this paper . hawking radiation results from the quantum effect of fields in a classical geometry with an event horizon .",
    "the flux of hawking radiation can be also obtained through the scattering analysis and there have been the studies of the grey body factor for various black holes to calculate the hawking temperature @xmath1 @xcite . to calculate the entropy of the black hole according to bekenstiein black hole entropy @xcite",
    "there are a number of similarities between black - hole physics and thermodynamics .",
    "most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black hole area and of entropy . in wald formula for entropy",
    "had shown that this term is dependent on area of the black hole @xmath2 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show this fact with a different coefficient because of the lagrangian density that we use in wald integral . at the end of this section",
    "we calculate the effective value of komar angular momentum by the space - like killing vector of black hole and using the hodge operators . in section ( [ first ] )",
    ", it is verified that the first law of thermodynamics will be held .",
    "the paper is concluded in section ( [ conclusion ] ) .",
    "in this section , we briefly explain the metric solution of a black hole in conformal gravity @xcite . here",
    "we start with the action @xmath3+s_m,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 -\\frac{1}{2}[g_{\\mu\\lambda}r_{\\nu\\theta } - g_{\\mu\\theta}r_{\\lambda\\nu } - g_{\\nu\\lambda}r_{\\mu\\theta } + g_{\\mu\\theta}r_{\\nu\\lambda}],\\ ] ] is the weyl conformal tensor . as a result the overall coupling of the theory",
    "@xmath5 is dimensionless which seems is a good news for uv finiteness of the theory @xcite .",
    "after varying the action with respect to the metric and one obtains the equation of motion as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is bach tensor and is defined as @xmath8 in addition , one finds that the matter part of the action should also respect to the scaling symmetry because the left hand side of the above equation is traceless so the matter part of the action should have a traceless energy - momentum tensor .",
    "fortunately , by introducing a conformal coupling term for the scalar mass term is the standard model lagrangian is also conformably invariant @xcite . in particular it has obtained @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the lie algebra valued field strength tensor of gauge field . after solving the equation of motion for these fields it has also obtained @xcite @xmath12,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is einstein tensor .      in this part",
    "we use the slowly rotating solutions for pure conformal gravity , that obtained in @xcite .",
    "let us consider the following line element around a rotating black hole @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 here we consider as constant of integration , @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the coefficient that appears in metric because of the conformal gravity solution , @xmath20 , that @xmath21 is the cosmological constant , and @xmath22 is the constant value independent to r , @xmath23;therefor , we can write the metric solution as a familiar form of    @xmath24",
    "in this section , we calculate the thermodynamical quantities of a rotating black hole with the metric in previous section .",
    "we work in a system , that the value of @xmath25 .      in this part , first we obtain the black hole singularity by solving the equation @xmath26 , so we can find the radius of black hole .",
    "this is a cubic equation that have three roots for @xmath27 .",
    "two of the roots are imaginary and for this reason they will be neglected .",
    "the other one is positive and the largest(@xmath28 ) and it gives the physical information that we want to obtain in this paper .",
    "after that , we obtain the area of the horizon for the black hole , which is a considerable importance because of the area theorem , which states that the horizon area of a classical black hole can never decrease in any physical process .    by setting @xmath29 in the metric line elements",
    ", we can find line elements for the 2-dimensional horizon ,    @xmath30    the area of the black hole horizon is then @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the metric tensor for the black hole horizon .",
    "the entropy of black holes can be computed by the wald formula",
    "@xcite    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the metric determinant on the surface .    in conformal gravity",
    "we have @xcite    @xmath35    after some calculations one can show that    @xmath36    the indices @xmath37 and @xmath38 take the ( @xmath39,@xmath40 ) directions , thus we have    @xmath41 , \\ ] ]    and @xmath42 therefore by using eq.([langrangian derivative ] ) and eq.([horizon integral elements])we find the entropy as follow @xmath43a_{h } , \\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the area of the black hole .      in this part we attempt to obtain temperature of the aforementioned black hole .",
    "according to the hawking radiation theorem , black hole temperature is dependent on surface gravity@xmath45 , that it is equal to @xcite    @xmath46    where @xmath47    in which @xmath48 , is the angular velocity of the black hole and equal to    @xmath49    the normalization condition verifies that @xmath50    so we obtain @xmath51 as @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "using the inverse metric coefficient @xmath54 @xmath55    since we are interested to obtain the surface gravity on the event horizon , so only we calculate the first term of eq.([4-vector acceleration1 ] ) , then as a result the surface gravity on the event horizon is equal to    @xmath56    where @xmath57    by using eq.([4-vector acceleration1 ] ) and eq.([gr ] ) we can calculate the surface gravity @xmath58 thus the temperature is given by @xmath59 +      the komar definition of the conserved quantity , corresponding to the space - like killing vector @xmath60 , in a coordinate free notation is given by @xcite    @xmath61    where @xmath62    instead of working with @xmath63 we work with orthonormal one forms ,",
    "so we write eq.([derivative ] ) as ,    @xmath64    where @xmath65    @xmath66    @xmath67    @xmath68    the dual of eq.([derivative ] ) is @xcite @xmath69    we can write eq.([dual ] ) as @xmath70 where @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75    to calculate komar effective angular momentum we need to define a boundary surface @xmath76 , that it is characterised by a constant @xmath40 and @xmath77 , so we have    @xmath78    so we can write eq.([k ] ) as , @xmath79 moving along a closed contour , the first term of the right hand side gives the shift of time between the initial and the final events .",
    "since we are performing an integration over simultaneous events this term must be subtracted from eq.([k integral ] ) @xcite,@xcite , so we write that as follow @xmath80 by using eq.([lambda ] ) @xmath81 using the metric coefficient @xmath82 @xmath83 after calculating the integral in eq.([k integral1 ] ) by using eq.([g_03 ] ) , eq.([g_33 ] ) we obtain the angular momentum as below    @xmath84",
    "for perturbations of stationary black holes , the change of energy is related to change of area , angular momentum and electric charge according to equations below @xmath85 where @xmath86    since entropy is dependent to the area of black hole , thus @xmath87 is proportional to @xmath88 : in addition , due to the energy of black hole is dependent on it s mass , @xmath89 is proportional to @xmath90 ; as a result , for eq.([tds ] ) we have    @xmath91    for this black hole we have @xmath92 because it is neutral , and @xmath93 .",
    "therefore the first law of thermodynamics for this black hole is as follow    @xmath94    in conclusion we saw that the first law of black holes thermodynamics is held .",
    "in this paper we have used the metric of a rotating black hole , that has obtained in conformal gravity to calculate the thermodynamical quantities of it .",
    "we have calculated the hawking temperature@xmath95 by the formula @xmath96 and the entropy of a rotating black hole as the function of area of the black hole by using the lagrangian density for the metric in conformal gravity according to wald formula and after that we have calculated the effective value of angular momentum with komar expression for this black hole at any distance @xmath40 , by choosing boundary of a finite spatial surface of radius @xmath40 .",
    "this choice enabled us to evaluate the komar integrals without any asymptotic approximation . at the end",
    "we have shown that the first law of the thermodynamics is held for this black hole .",
