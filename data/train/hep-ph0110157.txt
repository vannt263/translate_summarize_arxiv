    "the standard model of particle physics provides an extremely successful description of all known particles and their interactions , but fails to address many deeper questions concerning their physical origin . among the least understood phenomena is cp violation . at present , the only observed source of cp violation in the standard model is the phase of the ckm matrix .",
    "its fundamental origins are unknown . further , while cp violation is an essential ingredient of almost all attempts to explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe  @xcite ( alternative explanations are subject to stringent bounds : see , _",

    "@xcite ) , the amount of cp violation present in the ckm matrix is insufficient to explain the observed asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "searches for cp violation beyond the ckm matrix are necessary to shed light on this puzzle and are also probes of physics beyond the standard model .    electric dipole moments ( edms ) violate both parity ( p ) and time reversal ( t ) invariance . if cpt is assumed to be an unbroken symmetry , a permanent edm is , then , a signature of cp violation @xcite . a non - vanishing permanent",
    "edm has not been measured for any of the known elementary particles . in the standard model ,",
    "edms are generated only at the multi - loop level and are predicted to be many orders of magnitude below the sensitivity of foreseeable experiments  @xcite .",
    "a non - vanishing edm therefore would be unambiguous evidence for cp violation beyond the ckm matrix , and searches for permanent edms of fundamental particles are powerful probes of extensions of the standard model .",
    "in fact , current edm bounds are already some of the most stringent constraints on new physics , and they are highly complementary to many other low energy constraints , since they require cp violation , but not flavor violation .    the field of precision muon physics will be transformed in the next few years  @xcite .",
    "the edm of the muon is therefore of special interest .",
    "a new bnl experiment  @xcite has been proposed to measure the muon s edm at the level of @xmath1 more than five orders of magnitude below the current bound  @xcite @xmath2 and even higher precision might be attainable at a future neutrino factory complex @xcite .",
    "the interest in the muon s edm is further heightened by the recent measurement of the muon s anomalous magnetic dipole moment ( mdm ) @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the muon s gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "the current measurement @xmath5  @xcite from the muon @xmath6 experiment at brookhaven differs from the standard model prediction @xmath7  @xcite by @xmath8 : @xmath9    the muon s edm and mdm arise from similar operators , and this tentative evidence for a non - standard model contribution to @xmath10 also motivates the search for the muon s edm  @xcite .",

    "@xcite in section  [ sec : experimental ] we discuss the interplay between the new physics contributions to the muon mdm and edm , and their manifestation in muon dipole moment experiments .",

    "( [ both ] ) , we see that , more generally , it may arise from some combination of magnetic and electric dipole moments from new physics .",

    "( [ proposededm ] ) implies that even relatively small departures from naive scaling may yield an observable signal .",

    "( for violations of naive scaling in other models , see , for example , ref .  @xcite . )",
    "many additional mass parameters are introduced in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model .",

    "@xcite .",
    "scalar degeneracy is the most obvious way to reduce flavor changing effects to allowable levels .",
    "therefore many schemes for mediating supersymmetry breaking try to achieve degeneracy .",
    "however , in many of these , with the exception of simple gauge mediation models , there may be non - negligible contributions to scalar masses that are generation - dependent .",

    "naive scaling is also broken if the @xmath77-terms are not proportional to the corresponding yukawa couplings .",
    "just as in the case of non - degeneracy , deviations from proportionality are found in many models .",
    "although for large @xmath64 , the @xmath77 term contribution to the edm is suppressed relative to the typically dominant chargino contribution , there are many possibilities that may yield large effects . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , it was noted that @xmath97 may be such that the chargino and neutralino contributions to @xmath98 cancel , while , since @xmath99 , there is no cancellation in @xmath29 , and observable values are possible .",
    "finally , most models of high - scale supersymmetry breaking  @xcite typically contain flavor violation as well .",
    "in particular , smuon - stau mixing leads to a potentially significant enhancement in @xmath31 , because it breaks naive scaling by introducing contributions enhanced by @xmath100 . in order to evaluate the significance of this enhancement",

    "while the existing deviation in @xmath0 may be interpreted as evidence for new physics in either the muon s mdm or edm , the proposed experiment will definitively resolve this ambiguity , and may also uncover new physics in a wide variety of superysmmetric extensions of the standard model .    the work of j.l.f .",
