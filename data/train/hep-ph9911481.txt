    "recent neutrino oscillation experiments suggest the strong evidences of the tiny neutrino masses and the lepton flavor mixing @xcite-@xcite .",
    "studies of the lepton flavor mixing matrix , which we call maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) matrix @xcite , will give us important cues of the physics beyond the standard model .",
    "one of the most important studies of the lepton - flavor mixing is the analysis of quantum corrections of the mns matrix @xcite-@xcite.especially , the majorana phase plays the crucial role for stabilities of the mixing angle against quantum corrections @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the energy - scale dependence of the mns matrix with the physical majorana phase in two generation neutrinos . according to the lsnd experiment@xcite",
    ", the scenario of two heavy degenerate neutrinos can be realistic , where we can neglect the first generation effects in the energy - scale dependence of the mns matrix .",
    "in this scenario , the mns matrix has two parameters , which are the mixing angle and the majorana phase .",
    "the energy - scale dependence of them are completely determined by only one parameter @xmath0 which is the ratio between the diagonal elements of neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the energy - scale dependence of @xmath0 can be easily solved .",
    "when we use this parameter @xmath0 , we can easily obtain the analytic solution to the energy - scale dependence of physical parameters in the mns matrix which are the mixing angle and the majorana phase .",
    "the energy - scale dependence of @xmath1 is also determined by only one parameter @xmath0 , where @xmath2 is the mass - squared difference between the second and the third generations and @xmath3 is the absolute value of the heaviest neutrino mass .",
    "the energy - scale dependence of the majorana phase is clarified by using these analytic solutions .",
    "the instability of the majorana phase causes in the same parameter region in which the mixing angle is unstable against quantum corrections .",
    "the effective yukawa couplings in the lepton sector are given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the su(2)@xmath8 doublet higgs bosons that give dirac masses to the up - type and down - type fermions , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is the @xmath10-th generation su(2)@xmath8 doublet lepton .",
    "@xmath11 is the @xmath10-th generation right - handed charged - lepton .",
    "the matrix @xmath4 induces the neutrino majorana mass matrix .",
    "@xmath12 is the yukawa matrix of the charged - lepton . in this paper , we take the diagonal base of @xmath12 . once @xmath12 is taken diagonal at a certain scale , the diagonality of it is kept at all energies in the one - loop level .",
    "this is because there are no lepton - flavor - mixing terms , except for @xmath4 in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . in this base",
    "the matrix @xmath4 is diagonalized as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an unitary matrix ( the mns matrix ) and @xmath15 is the diagonalized mass matrix .",
    "the mns matrix @xmath14 is parameterized as , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mixing angle and @xmath18 is the majorana phase .",
    "the phases of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are unphysical parameters , which can be rotated out by the field redefinition .",
    "since @xmath4 is complex and symmetric matrix , @xmath4 can be parameterized as @xcite @xmath21 in this parameterization , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are non - negative values and energy - scale independent parameters .",
    "the energy - scale dependence of the @xmath4 can be controlled by two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath24 . since the @xmath24 is overall factor , the energy - scale dependence of the mixing angle and the majorana phase in the mns matrix",
    "are governed by only one parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the renormalization group equation for @xmath0 is given as @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the scaling parameter which is related to the renormalization scale @xmath27 as @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 are yukawa couplings of the charged - leptons , @xmath31 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "we can obtain the solution to eq.([rger1 ] ) as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a certain high energy scale .",
    "when @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the ratio of two vacuum expectation values of higgs bosons @xmath36 , the parameter @xmath37 can be obtained approximately @xcite as @xmath38    figure  [ fig : epsilon ] shows the @xmath35 dependence of @xmath37 at @xmath39gev and @xmath40gev .",
    "since the energy - scale dependence of @xmath0 is very small , the difference between the values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 is not so large @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the case of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath37 is nearly equal to @xmath45 .",
    "by using the energy - scale dependent parameters @xmath0 and @xmath24 , and the energy - scale independent parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the masses of neutrinos , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , are given as @xmath48 the function @xmath49 is defined as @xmath50 where the function @xmath51 is defined as @xmath52 the mass - squared difference between neutrinos is given as @xmath53 the mass - squared difference scaled by the heaviest neutrino mass @xmath54 can be given as @xmath55    by using the parameters , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath0 , the mixing angle @xmath17 and the majorana phase @xmath18 can be written as @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    "the energy - scale dependent parameter is only @xmath0 in the physical parameters of eqs.([deg1 ] ) , ( [ mix1 ] ) and ( [ majo1 ] ) . thus studying the energy - scale dependence of the physical parameters is equivalent to studying the @xmath0 dependence of them .    at the low energy - scale , the large",
    "mixing between the second and the third generations , @xmath58 is favored by the atmospheric neutrino experiments @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath59 should be required at the low energy - scale from the eq.([mix1 ] ) .",
    "there are following two cases which satisfy the eq.([eq : cond1 ] ) :    \\(a ) the parameter @xmath22 is very large such as @xmath60 in this case , the energy - scale dependence of the physical parameters is negligible , because the dominant component of the @xmath4 is the energy - scale independent parameter @xmath22 .",
    "however , even if the parameter @xmath22 is enough large but finite , eq.([eq : cond2 ] ) is not satisfied in the vicinity of @xmath61 . in this parameter region ,",
    "the large mixing is unstable against quantum corrections .",
    "when @xmath0 is in the vicinity of the zero , the parameter @xmath22 must be infinitely large in order to satisfy eq.([eq : cond2 ] ) .",
    "equation([eq : cond2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the absolute value of the off - diagonal elements in the matrix @xmath4 .",
    "when is satisfied , the large mixing is always preserved against quantum corrections @xcite .",
    "this case corresponds with so - called pseudo - dirac type neutrino mass matrix @xcite .",
    "\\(b ) the parameter @xmath0 is nearly equal to 1 with @xmath64 .",
    "we discuss the case of @xmath65 later . in this case , it is necessary that we study the @xmath0 dependence of the physical parameters in the vicinity of the @xmath66 , because mixing angle @xmath67 is not stable against quantum corrections in this region @xcite .",
    "since the large @xmath22 makes the mixing angle to be stable against quantum corrections as we have seen in the case ( a ) , we study the region of @xmath68 .    here",
    "we input @xmath69 at @xmath70 scale .",
    "figure [ fig : mixing1 ] shows the contour plot of @xmath71 at @xmath33 scale ( @xmath72 ) for the continuous changes of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the more the value deviates from 1 the larger the change of the mixing angle by quantum corrections becomes . as the values of @xmath23 approach @xmath73 and the parameter @xmath22 becomes small , the @xmath71 becomes unstable against quantum correction .",
    "when we define @xmath74 and take the parameters , @xmath22 , @xmath37 and @xmath75 to be small , the left - hand side of eq.([eq : cond1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath76 this indicates that if the @xmath77 is much smaller than @xmath37 , eq.([eq : cond1 ] ) is not satisfied . therefor the mixing angle is unstable against the quantum corrections in this region .",
    "this result is the same as that of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to understand the physical meaning of the parameters @xmath0(@xmath37 ) , @xmath22 and @xmath23(@xmath75 )",
    "obviously , these parameters should be related to the other physical parameters , the majorana phase and the mass - squared difference .",
    "especially , it is necessary to investigate the physical meaning of the parameter regions in which the mixing angle @xmath71 is unstable against quantum corrections .",
    "figure [ fig : majorana1 ] shows the majorana phase @xmath18 in eq.([majo1 ] ) in the vicinity of @xmath78 for @xmath79 and @xmath80 cases , when we take @xmath81 and @xmath72 for both cases .",
    "we set the @xmath82 at the @xmath70 scale .",
    "figure [ fig : majorana1 ] shows that the majorana phase is not changed by the quantum corrections , when the @xmath23 is not close to @xmath73 . by using small parameter @xmath75 , the majorana phase is obtained as @xmath83 for @xmath66 . by using this equation",
    ", we obtain the majorana phase at the @xmath70 scale for the large mixing . on the other hand , when the @xmath23 is close to the @xmath73 , the majorana phase is changed by the quantum corrections and it always becomes close to @xmath84 .",
    "the mixing angle is unstable against quantum corrections in the region of small @xmath22 and @xmath85 .",
    "comparing to figure [ fig : mixing1 ] and figure [ fig : majorana1 ] , we notice that the instability of the majorana phase causes in the same parameter region in which the mixing angle is unstable against quantum corrections .",
    "figure [ fig : massdiff1 ] shows the contour plot of @xmath86 in eq.([deg1 ] ) at @xmath81 and @xmath72 for the continuous changes of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "according to the figure [ fig : massdiff1 ] , the parameter region in which the mixing angle is unstable against quantum corrections is corresponding to the region in which the masses are more degenerate .",
    "this result is consistent with that of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , we discuss the special case of @xmath65 , where the @xmath0 dependence of the mixing angle and the majorana phase @xmath18 are quite different from the case of @xmath64 . in this case eq.([mix1 ] ) becomes @xmath87 this equation indicates that @xmath71 does not automatically take the maximal mixing at @xmath88 .",
    "it is because the mixing angle becomes @xmath89 when @xmath66 .",
    "thus the large mixing angle is only realized when @xmath90 ( case ( a ) ) where the large mixing is stable against quantum corrections .",
    "for the majorana phase , we can obtain @xmath91 from eq.([majo1 ] ) at @xmath65 . in this case",
    ", the majorana phase does not depend on @xmath0 and @xmath22 .",
    "therefore the majorana phase is independent of the energy - scale .",
    "in this paper we study the energy - scale dependence of the mns matrix with the physical majorana phase in two generation neutrinos . according to the lsnd experiment@xcite",
    ", the scenario of two heavy degenerate neutrinos can be realistic and important , where the first generation effects are neglected in the energy - scale dependence of the mns matrix . in this case",
    ", the mns matrix has two physical parameters , which are the mixing angle @xmath17 and the majorana phase @xmath18 .",
    "the energy - scale dependence of these parameters are controlled by only one parameter @xmath0 which is the ratio of the diagonal elements in the neutrino mass matrix @xcite .",
    "this @xmath0 also governs the mass - squared difference scaled by the heaviest neutrino mass .",
    "we can easily solve the renormalization group equation of this parameter , @xmath0 .",
    "then the analytic solutions to the energy - scale dependence of the physical parameters can be obtained .",
    "especially , the energy - scale dependence of the majorana phase is clarified by using these analytic solutions .",
