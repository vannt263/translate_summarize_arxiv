    "the group of about ten central compact objects ( ccos ) in supernova remnants ( snrs ) are defined by their steady thermal x - ray emission , which is their only observational manifestation .",
    "three ccos have measured spin periods and spin - down rates , indicating that they are weakly magnetized neutron stars ( nss ) with dipole fields in the range @xmath9  g @xcite and negligible spin - down power in comparison with their bolometric x - ray luminosities of @xmath10  erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "those ccos that are as - yet unpulsed have the same general spectral properties as the cco pulsars , strongly suggesting that they are a uniform class .",
    "these @xmath11  yr old nss must represent a significant fraction of ns births .",
    "see @xcite for a review of cco properties and theories .",
    "hot regions with different temperatures and areas on the ns surface are deduced from the x - ray spectra and , where available , pulse profiles of ccos .",
    "paradoxically , such nonuniform surface temperature appears to require strong crustal magnetic fields , much stronger than the external dipole , to channel heat conduction .",
    "the evolution of ccos after their snrs dissipate is a subject plagued by significant unknowns , primarily because their immediate descendants are not yet evident in existing surveys @xcite .",
    "these factors support theories in which the intrinsic magnetic fields of ccos are the same as those of ordinary pulsars , but their surface fields change dramatically in time , as will be discussed below .    in this paper , we present additional x - ray studies of one cco ,  ( also known as ) , and the unusual ns calvera , which may be related to ccos in evolutionary theories .",
    "this work involves proper motion measurements and timing using archival and newly obtained x - ray observations of these two pulsars , designed to address questions of their origin , age , and location .",
    "the ns candidate , dubbed `` calvera , '' was discovered in the  all - sky survey and first studied with  by @xcite and @xcite . using , @xcite revealed 59  ms pulsations from calvera .",
    "it is apparently radio quiet despite deep searches for pulsations at the known period @xcite .",
    "we recently made x - ray measurements of the spin - down of calvera @xcite , which showed that , unlike the ccos , this pulsar is quite energetic , with spin - down power @xmath12  erg  s@xmath1 and characteristic age @xmath13  yr .",
    "calvera s place among the families of nss is unclear , in part because its distance and luminosity are highly uncertain .",
    "its apparently thermal x - ray emission can be modeled to place a rough upper limit of @xmath14  kpc for a typical ns surface area @xcite , although as a `` young '' pulsar at high galactic latitude , @xmath5 , it may be @xmath15 times closer than that . given its energetics , it is somewhat surprising that no @xmath16-rays have been detected from calvera by the _ fermi _ large area telescope .",

    "this observation placed calvera on the optical axis , with the reference source @xmath44 off - axis having only eight photons @xcite . with this in mind , in planning for the proper motion measurement we placed the faint reference source on the optical axis instead to minimize the combined measured uncertainty .",

    "briefly , this method is based on a simple centroid calculation for the source location that is corrected for the bias introduced in the measured coordinates due to any asymmetry in the psf .",
    "this bias increases for sources farther from the optical axis and depends on the azimuthal orientation of the source in the focal plane .",
    "we consider this method preferable to forward fitting to a psf model , for both faint and bright sources .",
    "a sophisticated method is not warranted for locating sources with few counts because it can introduce additional systematic errors , nor is it needed for highly significant sources ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to determine the psf bias we produced a high statistic chart / marx simulation of each source at each epoch and compared their input coordinates to their centroid determined values",
    "the relative offsets give the bias corrections to the astrophysical measurements .",
    "the centroid measurements were iterated using the ciao tool _ dmstat _ applied to photons extracted using a circular aperture whose radii are given in table  [ hrclog ] . in each case , the radii were chosen to enclose essentially all of the signal within that region of the psf having a finite probability of producing a single count during the observation . to estimate the uncertainties in these x - ray",
    "coordinates we generated monte carlo images for each measured source by sampling the chart / marx simulated psfs to match the observed source counts . from 10,000 realizations we accumulated centroid measurements to build up a distribution in right ascension and declination . to account for the observed background , in these simulations we included a random distribution of the estimated number of background photons within the source aperture .",
    "the resulting ( gaussian ) width of the monte carlo centroids are found to be consistent with the expected `` standard error '' derived from the centroid measurement , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the number of source counts in the aperture .",
    "the final centroids of the reference source and calvera in the two hrc - i images , corrected for the psf bias , were then tied to the usno b1.0 system using our optical astrometry described above .",

    "but calvera is not likely to be an aligned rotator given its large x - ray pulsed fraction .",
    "therefore , such a small distance would imply a new constraint on models of radio and @xmath16-ray beaming , as calvera is silent in both bands .",
    "alternatively , a distance up to @xmath130  kpc for calvera is allowed by either the surface area of the thermal emission , or the conversion of rotational energy to luminosity .",
    "it is entirely possible that some of its thermal emission is due to polar cap heating by backflowing magnetospheric particles .",
    "a typical ratio @xmath131 attributed to this process is seen in thermally emitting millisecond pulsars .",
    "calvera s bolometric x - ray luminosity is @xmath132 erg  s@xmath1 , consistent with the typical @xmath131 at @xmath85  kpc . at such distance ,",
    "calvera must have been born in the halo , possibly of a runaway o or b star progenitor from the disk . in that case",
    "its proper motion could have been oriented randomly after the supernova kick .",
    "because of its intermediate strength magnetic field , calvera is of particular interest as a possible prototype cco descendant with an emerging magnetic field .",
    "its actual age could be much less than its present characteristic age .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of calvera is best fitted by a two temperature , blackbody or hydrogen atmosphere model , with @xmath133 in the range 0.10.25  kev @xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to characterize its thermal age using theoretical cooling curves because they are highly uncertain , and also because calvera s x - ray emitting hot spot(s ) probably do not represent the full surface area of the ns .",
    "thus , the distance and age of calvera both remain uncertain by an order of magnitude , and its potential to illuminate the evolution of ccos is yet to be fully realized .",
    "the insignificant proper motion of , @xmath134  mas  yr@xmath1 is much smaller than the @xmath105  mas  yr@xmath1 predicted by @xcite based on the separation of the ns from the apparent center of , and it does not point toward the north east , away from the center as would be expected .",
    "this shows that the shape of the snr is not a reliable indicator of the location of its kinematic ( expansion ) center .",
    "the kinematics of the remnant have not in fact been measured . @xcite and @xcite noted that the eastern side of the snr has a smaller radius of curvature than the western side , which could be used to argue that the supernova occurred further to the east , closer to the present position of the ns .",
    "the small proper motion of  also means that the kinematic contribution to its period derivative is negligible , @xmath135 from equation ( 1 ) , compared to the observed @xmath136 , so its spin - down magnetic field does not have to be modified .",
    "this result also suggests that ccos do not receive larger kick velocities than average .",
    "although  in  has an unusually large tangential velocity of @xmath137  km  s@xmath1 , it is balanced by the smaller than average velocity of , @xmath94 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the only other cco that has a velocity estimate , which is reliable as it refers to the kinematic center of its snr , is the ns in cas  a , for which @xcite and @xcite find @xmath138  km  s@xmath1 , close to the average of young pulsars .",
    "this implies that , in the theory of prompt fall - back and field burial onto ccos , the ns kick velocity is not an important factor in determining how much mass is accreted .",
    "we thank the referee for a careful reading of the manuscript , and for suggesting several additions that improved its clarity and completeness . financial support for this work",
