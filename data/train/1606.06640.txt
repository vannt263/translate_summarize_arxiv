    "individual words encode substantial amounts of grammatical information ( such as number , person , case , gender , tense , aspect , etc . ) in the word form , whereas morphologically poor languages ( e.g. , english ) rely more on word order and context to express this information .",

    "<S> this paper investigates neural character - based morphological tagging for languages with complex morphology and large tag sets . </S>",
    "<S> we systematically explore a variety of neural architectures ( dnn , cnn , cnnhighway , lstm , blstm ) to obtain character - based word vectors combined with bidirectional lstms to model across - word context in an end - to - end setting . </S>",
    "<S> we explore supplementary use of word - based vectors trained on large amounts of unlabeled data . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments for morphological tagging suggest that for `` simple '' model configurations , the choice of the network architecture ( cnn vs. cnnhighway vs. lstm vs. blstm ) or the augmentation with pre - trained word embeddings can be important and clearly impact the accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the model capacity by adding depth , for example , and carefully optimizing the neural networks can lead to substantial improvements , and the differences in accuracy ( but not training time ) become much smaller or even negligible . </S>",
    "<S> overall , our best morphological taggers for german and czech outperform the best results reported in the literature by a large margin . </S>"
