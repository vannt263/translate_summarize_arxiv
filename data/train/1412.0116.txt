    "since cabibbo first noted the difference between the decays of neutron ( @xmath3 ) and muon ( @xmath4 ) and suggested there is a mixing angle between d and s quarks@xcite , and the mixing perfectly explained the data of the @xmath5decays of @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "later the ckm matrix @xcite has been proposed to mix the three generation quarks . in the @xmath8 matrix",
    "there are three mixing angles and a cp phase which seem to be completely independent of each other .",
    "the mixing is understood as that the eigen - basis of weak interaction is not the same as that of mass , so matching them , a unitary transformation matrix must be introduced@xcite . from then on , the research field about quark mixing has been thoroughly investigated and exploration of its source has never ceased . in analog to the quark sector , the pontecorvo - maki - nakawaga - sakata ( pmns ) matrix @xcite relates the lepton flavor eigenstates with the mass eigenstates .",
    "thus it is natural to consider that there might be an underlying symmetry which results in the practical ckm and pmns matrices after symmetry breaking .",
    "recent studies on these matrices indicate that there exist the quark - lepton complementarity and self - complementarity@xcite which hint an existence of a higher symmetry .",
    "all the progress in this area inspires a trend of searching for whether such a hidden symmetry indeed exists and moreover investigation of its phenomenological implication is also needed .",
    "the key point is to investigate whether there exist some relations among the matrix elements of the ckm and/or pmns matrices which seem to be completely independent if there is no such a symmetry to make an arrangement .",
    "there are nine parametrization schemes which manifest the mixing in different ways .",
    "therefore , we expect that some relations among the parameters of these nine schemes might hint a hidden symmetry if they indeed exist . listing the parameters ( the mixing angles and cp phase ) of the nine schemes in a table and staring on them , we notice that there are relations among the sine values of the cp phases in these schemes .",
    "namely , for the nine parametrization schemes , we find equalities among those @xmath9 i.e. @xmath10 and @xmath11 where the the subscripts @xmath12 through @xmath13 refer to the nine parametrization schemes .",
    "considering the relations not to be accidental , we would be tempted to believe there is a hidden symmetry . then associating the expressions of jarlskog invariant which include sine values of the cp phases in all schemes with the experimentally measurable ckm matrix elements @xmath14 and using the above relations , we establish several equalities which do not depend on any concrete parametrization scheme at all . in principle when we apply the equalities to a special scheme",
    ", the solutions of those equalities would give the values of the parameters of the concerned scheme up to a universal dimensionless constant .",
    "what is the universal dimensionless constant ? surely it must be a scheme - independent quantity and has clear physics significance .",
    "naturally , one can conjecture that the jarlskog invariant@xcite which is related to the cp violation of hadrons is the best choice .",
    "thus we would accept the allegation .",
    "however , we also notice that all the equalities only approximately hold , even though the coincidence is very high .",
    "this can be well understood that the hidden symmetry is slightly broken , but some characteristics of the original symmetry is partly retained after the breaking .",
    "the approximate equalities are listed in the context of this work .",
    "we generalize the relations among the ckm matrix to the pmns case and find that all the aforementioned equalities also hold for the lepton sector , even though the accuracy is not as high as for the quark sector . along the line , we further investigate the induced phenomenological implication which may be tested in more accurate neutrino experiments .    the paper is organized as follows . after the introduction we present those relations in section ii . in section iii , we check these relations numerically . in section",
    "iv we will discuss the implications about the possible hidden symmetry and draw our conclusion .",
    "in this section we show how to obtain the relations among the elements of the ckm and as well the pmns matrices .      mixing among different flavors of quarks ( leptons ) via the ckm ( pmns )",
    "matrix has been firmly recognized and widely applied to phenomenological studies of hadronic processes .",
    "the lagrangian of the weak interaction reads @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18and @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are the ckm and pmns matrices respectively .",
    "the @xmath8 mixing matrices are written as @xmath22    generally , for a @xmath8 unitary matrix there are four independent parameters , namely three mixing angles and one cp - phase .",
    "there can be various schemes to parameterize the matrix and in literature , nine different schemes are presented and widely applied .",
    "they are clearly listed in ref.@xcite . here",
    "we try to collect those elements for various parametrization schemes in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the mixing angles and cp - phase . for clarity ,",
    "we use @xmath25 and @xmath26 to denote the corresponding quantities in the pmns matrix .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + ( a ) ( b )    then we extend the same calculation to the pmns case . with the mixing angles @xmath27 and @xmath28 in p@xmath2 parametrization which are experimentally measured with certain errors , we compute corresponding @xmath29 which depends on @xmath30 and the result is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : dep](b ) .",
    "it is also noted , the value of @xmath29 does not vary much within a relatively wide range @xmath31 to @xmath32 centered at @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , it is hard to firmly fix the cp phase at the lepton sector with this @xmath29 method , and one needs to wait for the more accurate long - baseline neutrino experiments in the future to determine its value .",
    "our estimate merely indicates its possible range .",
    "as is well known , the ckm and pmns matrices emerge due to the mismatch between the mass eigenstates and flavor eigenstates in the quark and lepton sectors respectively .",
    "the masses of different generations are not the same and compose the hierarchy problem .",
    "that is one of the unknown parts in particle physics .",
    "there must be sort of association between the mass hierarchy and mixing matrix .",
    "in a recent paper xing@xcite reviews the situation and extends the discussion from the quark sector to the lepton sector .",
    "merlo also discusses the neutrino masses and mixing from continuous symmetries@xcite .",
    "especially , the mass hierarchy problem of neutrinos i.e. it is either normal or inverted , is seriously considered and the juno experiment which will operate in china in a few years , will determine it .",
    "there are still more mysteries for the mixing , for example , the complementarity relations between elements of ckm and pmns matrices and the self - complementarities among the matrix elements of pmns @xcite .",
    "it was studied that the obvious symmetry in pmns can be traced to the possible symmetric textures for lepton masses@xcite , thus whether a fundamental symmetry really exists and what it is , is still an unsolved problem in our theoretical prospect .",
    "therefore , we are tempted to investigate the ckm and pmns matrices from a new angle and hope to gain a better understanding of the possible underlying theories .",
    "we note several relations among the ckm matrix parameters of the nine parametrization schemes i.e. @xmath33 , by which we establish several scheme - independent equalities .",
    "those relations may imply existence of something which is independent of any concrete parametrization .",
    "the jarlskog invariant is a physically measurable quantity , so must be the same for all the schemes which include the sine values of the cp phase @xmath24 .    by the observation , it was suggested that the mixing matrices originate from a higher symmetry@xcite , and the nine parametrization schemes are merely various representations of the unique physical mixing matrix , therefore the relations among the sine values of the cp phases of the nine schemes actually reveal the inherent essence of the symmetry .",
    "we check these equalities numerically and find the first four hold with very high precision . moreover ,",
    "if the underlying symmetry really exists , the elements of the ckm matrix which seem to be in an anarchy state at first glimpse , might be well arranged according to a certain rule .",
    "thus we would see whether the ckm matrix elements can be completely determined from those equalities up to a universal constant , which is the jarlskog invariant .    on the other aspect ,",
    "most of the symmetries in the nature are somewhat broken .",
    "mostly , the breaking might not be too large , so people still can trace back to the original symmetry .",
    "for example , we proposed that breaking of the complementarity and self - complementarity between ckm and pmns matrices is due to the involvement of a sterile neutrino@xcite . here",
    "we can observe that the relations of the ckm matrix elements hold with high precision , but an approximation degree is also noted as @xmath34 .",
    "especially , the fifth relation listed in eq.([rl4 ] ) deviates from equality by @xmath35 .",
    "it is naturally conjectured that the relations obtained for the ckm matrix can also be applied to the pmns matrix .",
    "because the pmns matrix elements are not well measured as that of the ckm matrix , we can only expect that the relations among the pmns matrix elements only approximately hold .",
    "for the lepton case we can also estimate @xmath30 in terms of the @xmath29 method , the resultant @xmath36 . but as shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig : dep](b ) , the value @xmath29 does not vary much from @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , we can not firmly determine the cp phase for the lepton sector as much as we do for the quark sector from the relations yet .",
    "our observation on the relations indicates that a symmetry at higher scale does exist and after running down to the low energy scale its essential characters remain .",
    "therefore , even though it is slightly broken , we still can trace back to the original symmetry .",
    "further studies on the higher symmetry is definitely needed to eventually understand these relations .",
    "this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china ( nnsfc ) under the contract no .",
