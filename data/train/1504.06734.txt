    "symmetric matrix inversion is one of the most important problem for many practical tasks e.g. analysis of electrical circuits with inductance elements @xcite , synthesis of kalman or wiener filters @xcite , using of finite element method @xcite .",
    "existing symmetric matrix inversion methods are cholesky decomposition , ldl decomposition @xcite , bordering method @xcite , and the most efficient krishnamoorthy - menon s method ( based on cholesky decomposition , and requires @xmath0 operations with @xmath1 square roots computation ) @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to propose a symmetric matrix inversion method , which reduces machine time spending compared to krishnamoorthy - menon s method by avoiding of square root computations .",
    "moreover , this fact allow us to use the proposed method for efficient inverse of symmetric matrix not only with strict diagonal dominance , but without diagonal dominance as well .",
    "in this section shows modified gaussian elimination , which proposed method based on @xcite-@xcite .",
    "let there is a system of linear equations ( [ sle ] ) , @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 . during modified gaussian elimination an addition matrix @xmath6 changes instead of matrix @xmath7 , but",
