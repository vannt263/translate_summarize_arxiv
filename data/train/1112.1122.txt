    "two - body problem takes the most fundamental place in the process of exploring and understanding many - body properties .",
    "in particular , two - body solutions determine the essential interaction parameter in the microscopic many - body hamiltonian . in the field of dilute ultracold atoms ,",
    "the two - body interaction is generally formulated by the zero - range pseudo - potential , provided that it produces the same asymptotic two - body wavefunction at length scale much shorter than the mean inter - particle distance but longer than the range of realistic potential .",
    "the generalized pseudo - potentials for all partial - waves were first derived by huang and yang@xcite , and then improved later by stock _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "so far the most popular pseudo - potential is in s - wave channel described by a single s - wave scattering length , which can be improved by including the energy - dependence in a self - consistent way@xcite .",
    "another popular one is the p - wave pseudo - potential , described by the p - wave scattering volume which generally has strong energy - dependence@xcite .    in view of the great success when applying pseudo - potential models to the homogenous or trapped atomic gases , it is generally believed that this model will equally apply to other configurations , such as in the presence of spin - orbit(so ) coupling .",
    "recently , by sophisticated manipulations of laser field and magnetic field , the nist group has successfully realized an optically synthesized magnetic field for ultracold neutral atoms@xcite . as a result , an effective so coupling is generated in the system along one direction .",
    "subsequently there are several theoretical proposals to realize the symmetric rashba so coupling@xcite , and it is conceivable that an arbitrary type so coupling could be achieved in future experiments . as usual , all existing theoretical studies about the so coupled system are carried out in the framework of s - wave pseudo - potential , i.e. , using the s - wave scattering length as that without so coupling(see recent review @xcite ) . based on this model , the most remarkable effect of symmetric so coupling is to support a two - body bound state with an arbitrarily weak interaction , due to the modified low - energy density of state@xcite .",
    "although pseudo - potentials have been justified under confinement potentials@xcite , it is not obvious that it is still robust under the single - particle potential as special as so couplings . in the two - body scattering process , trapping potentials and so couplings have the same effect in mixing different partial - waves , either due to the trap anisotropy@xcite , or due to the intermediate coupling with spin sector .",
    "however , unlike the trapping potentials , which generally contribute a trivial constant potential as two particles get close , the so coupling intrinsically affects the kinetic term and thus still mix all partial - waves for the two - body wavefunctions at short inter - particle distance . this non - trivial effect is expected to have important influence on the validity of original pseudo - potentials in the presence of so coupling .",
    "for instance , an obvious deficiency of original s - wave pseudo - potential is that this model can predict arbitrarily deep bound state with the binding energy scaled in terms of the so coupling strength@xcite ; however , under a square - well ( attractive ) interaction potential the true binding energy must be lower - bounded by the potential depth .",
    "moreover , this discrepancy can not be amended by taking into account the energy - dependence of s - wave scattering length , as we shall show later in section iv .    in this paper , we make efforts to exactly solve the two - body problem with so coupling for a general short - range interaction potential , without resorting to pseudo - potential models . for simplicity but without the loss of essence , we have chosen the isotropic so coupling and studied in the subspace where only s - wave and p - wave scatterings are relevant . we show that the short - range parametrization of the wavefunction in each partial - wave channel will additionally rely on the scattering amplitude of another partial - wave channel , which reflects the mixed scattering between different orbital channels induced by so coupling .",
    "the exact form of wavefunction obtained above allows us to solve the two - body problem under a square - well interacting potential . by comparing with results from s - wave or p - wave pseudo - potentials ,",
    "we address the validity of the latter in the presence of isotropic so coupling .",
    "we find the s - wave pseudo - potential provides a good approximation for the low - energy scattering state and bound state solutions near s - wave resonance , with the correction depending on the strength of so coupling , the finite range of the potential and contributions from p - wave channel .",
    "however , near p - wave resonance , using the p - wave pseudo - potential alone will lead to results that are qualitatively different from exact solutions from the square - well potential .",
    "we conclude that the p - wave pseudo - potential can not be applied to fermion system if the so coupling strength is larger or comparable to the fermi momentum .",
    "we shall address the underlying reasons for these results .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the exact solution for two spin-@xmath0 fermions under a general short - range interaction potential and with isotropic so coupling . in section iii",
    "we reduce the exact solutions to the framework of original s - wave and p - wave pseudo - potentials . in section",
    "iv we present the numerical results for two - body problem under the square - well potential , from which we address the validity of s - wave and p - wave pseudo - potential models .",
    "we summarize the paper in the last section .",
    "in this section we shall solve the two - body scattering problem for a special case of isotropic so coupling . assuming a general form of short - range interaction potential ( see eq.[u_p ] )",
    ", we obtain the wavefunction of scattering state(eq.[psi_01_super2 ] ) and analyze its long - range and short - range asymptotic behaviors .",
    "particularly we show that its short - range behavior is parameterized by scattering amplitudes in all relevant partial - wave channels ( eqs.[short_psi0_f],[short_psi1_f ] ) .",
    "finally we present the bound state solutions which can be deduced from scattering state solutions via eq.[bs ] .",

    "as also mentioned in the introduction , the s - wave model(even using the energy - dependent @xmath219 ) is quite questionable when applied to deep molecules . as shown in fig.[fig_low - bound ] , the energy of the bound state is always lower bounded by the potential depth @xmath224 , i.e. , @xmath225 .",
    "however , the s - wave model will produce unphysically deep molecules with @xmath226 . in this case , the s - wave model alone will not work and one must take into account the effect mixed scattering with p - wave channel due to so couplings .    , in comparison with results using s - wave scattering length without(pink circles ) or with(black triangles ) energy - dependence .",

    "this is qualitatively different from the exact solution under the square - well potential , where each emergence of a new bound state requires a potential depth beyond the critical value ( as shown by red lines in fig.[fig_qc ] ) . in the limit of @xmath195 ,",
    "the critical depths continuously approach @xmath228 as in free space .",
    "the breakdown of p - wave model to bound state solutions will be discussed in the following section .      through the last subsection",
    ", we have shown that the so coupling has different effects on the validity of pseudo - potentials in s - wave and p - wave channels . in the limit of @xmath178 ,",
    "the s - wave pseudo - potential model provides good approximations to the low - energy scattering state and bound state solutions near s - wave resonances .",
    "for example , it predicts correctly the initial phase shift as @xmath229 for scattering state , and a bound state solution for arbitrarily weak attraction @xmath230 .",
    "however , near p - wave resonances the p - wave pseudo - potential will produce qualitatively different results compared with exact solutions .",
    "for example , in the limit of @xmath178 , the exact solutions approach free space results , i.e. , @xmath192 or @xmath193 , and each bound state emerges when @xmath133 goes across a resonance at certain critical potential depth ; on the contrary , the p - wave model predicts @xmath194 and a bound state for any weak p - wave interaction @xmath231 .",
    "here we analyze the reason why the s - wave pseudo - potential is approximately valid for so coupled system while p - wave is not .",
    "this can be explained from the correspondence between the assumptions of pseudo - potential models and the resulted short - range behavior of wavefunctions . for s - wave pseudo - potential(@xmath232 ) , the resulted wavefunction does not show @xmath233 singularity in p - wave channel , which is consistent with the assumption of zero scattering amplitude in eq.[u_p ] .",
    "however , the p - wave pseudo - potential(@xmath234 ) will induce an additional singularity in s - wave channel , i.e. , @xmath235 $ ] as @xmath236 .",
    "this in turn requires that the interaction operator @xmath44 also generate scattering amplitude in the s - wave channel , contradictory with the initial assumption that @xmath237 in eq.[u_p ] .",
    "this paradox also implies that any weak @xmath238 will have dramatic interference with the p - wave sector and lead to qualitatively different results from those using pseudo - potential entirely in p - wave channel .",
    "the results presented in this section tell us that the original pseudo - potentials formulated in the absence of so coupling do not necessarily apply to the case with so coupling .",
    "the pseudopotential model will certainly breakdown if the results obtained are inconsistent with initial assumptions of this model . in this case ,",
    "an appropriate interaction model should be constructed in order to rightly incorporate mixed scatterings between different partial - wave channels , which is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "in this paper , we exactly solve the two - body problem of spin-@xmath0 fermions with isotropic so coupling under a general short - range interaction potential , and investigate the validity of s - wave and p - wave pseudo - potentials formulated in the absence of so couplings .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows :    ( 1)in the presence of isotropic so coupling , the two - body scattered wavefunction exhibits exotic dependences on the momentum and phase shift ( eq.[psi_01_super2 ] ) . in each partial - wave channel",
    "the wavefunction at short inter - particle distance is parameterized by scattering amplitudes of all coupled scattering channels ( eqs.[short_psi0_f],[short_psi1_f ] ) .",
    "this feature reveals the mixed scattering between different partial - waves that is induced by the so coupling .",
    "( 2)under the conditions that the length scale of so coupling much longer than the range of the potential(@xmath178 ) and near s - wave resonances , the s - wave pseudo - potential gives a good approximation to the low - energy solutions , with the correction depending on the strength of so coupling , the finite range of the potential and contributions from other coupled partial - waves .",
    "( 3)near the p - wave resonance , the p - wave pseudo - potential model gives low - energy solutions that are qualitatively different from the exact ones from the square - well potential .",
    "the p - wave model alone can not be applied to the fermion system when the so coupling strength is larger or comparable to the fermi momentum .",
    "its breakdown is attributed to the inconsistent treatment between the assumption of the p - wave pseudo - potential and the resulted short - range singularities of wavefunction in s - wave channel .",
    "although above results are obtained for the special type of isotropic so coupling , they reveal the generic scattering properties modified by the coupling between spin and orbit .",
    "we therefore expect these results have strong implications to other systems with a general type of so coupling",
