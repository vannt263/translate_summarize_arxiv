    "carbon - nanotube field - effect transistor ( cntfet ) represents a potential candidate to compete traditional silicon mosfets especially for analog high - frequency applications  @xcite . in a high - quality intrinsic carbon nanotube ( cnt ) ,",
    "the electron - electron scattering is negligible and the dominant scattering mechanism is electron - phonon scattering  @xcite . in cnts under low voltage bias ,",
    "the electron mean free path ( mfp ) is observed to be very long ( ) , and is supposed to be nearly elastic and limited by acoustic phonon scattering @xcite . under high bias , optical phonon emission dominates and this results in a rather short electron mfp of about .",
    "due to the large optical phonon energy ( @xmath0 ) in cnts , the dc current is near - ballistic at low gate biases even though a significant amount of scattering exists near the drain end of the cnt channel  @xcite .",
    "however , under high biases , optical phonon scattering dominates the transport along the whole channel .",
    "early p - type cntfets were fabricated by using pt and au contacts  @xcite .",
    "transport in these devices is dominated by the schottky barriers ( sb ) existing at the metal source / drain contacts  @xcite . as a result , the on - state current is reduced  @xcite .",
    "since the rc time constant associated with the contact resistance can limit the frequency response of the devices , ohmic contacts with a low resistivity are preferable for high - frequency operation .",
    "different technologies have been developed to form n- and p - type ohmic contacts in cntfets . while the palladium ( pd ) contacts have been demonstrated to be barrier - free for hole carrier transport , gadolinium ( gd ) , yttrium ( y ) and scandium ( sc ) form n - type ohmic contacts with cnts  @xcite . to further improve the contact transparency ,",
    "different doping techniques have been developed  @xcite .",
    "the model execution time is a main stumbling block in the development of a circuit - level model .",
    "therefore , compact models are the preferred simulation tool for circuit designers to assess the actual performance potential of a technology . as it will be discussed below , the physics - based compact models reported in literature  @xcite predict an unphysical cntfet behavior at high biases .",
    "these models are , thus , not suitable for the design of analog high - frequency applications .    in this paper , we propose a physics - based analytical model for the electron transport through the intrinsic channel of a cntfet with ohmic contacts .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , the transport is evaluated in the quantum capacitance limit ( qcl ) .",
    "although a complete compact model suitable for circuit design should take into account the effect of the non - equilibrium mobile charge and terminal charges on the electrostatics , they are not considered here  @xcite .",
    "however , the proposed analytical models can be easily included in the compact models , which consider both the electron transmission and charge distribution in the channel . without loss of generality , we study cntfets with n - type ohmic contacts and consider electron scattering by both acoustic and optical phonons . the channel length is set to which is close to the sweet spot in silicon cmos for high - frequency analog applications .",
    "we consider two physics - based approaches for current calculations . in the first approach ,",
    "the transmission probability is a step - like function with respect to energy . in the other approach ,",
    "the transmission probability is a continuous energy - dependent function .",
    "the net electric current @xmath1 equals to the current @xmath2 flowing from the source to the drain ( @xmath3 branch ) minus the current @xmath4 flowing from the drain to the source ( @xmath5 branch )  @xcite @xmath6de}=i_{s}-i_{d } , \\label{eq : one1}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 denotes a non - equilibrium distribution function of electrons with positive and negative momenta @xmath8 , respectively , and corresponding to the @xmath9th electron subband @xmath10 at the current control point @xmath11 in the cnt channel .",
    "the current control point is estimated at the bottom of the space - dependent conduction subband @xmath12 using the condition that the transmission through that subband becomes negligible for electrons with energy less than the current control energy @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the last represents the lower limit of integration .",
    "the similar concept of the reduction of conduction band profile to a single current control point was used for si mosfets  @xcite . here , we suppose the 1st electron subband edge @xmath14 to be a half of the cnt band gap @xmath15 . for cnts ,",
    "the product of the spin and electron subband degeneracies gives a factor of 4 in front of the integral in  ( [ eq : one1 ] ) .",
    "the non - equilibrium distribution functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 in  ( [ eq : one1 ] ) can be obtained as a solution of the boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) by using the monte carlo method  @xcite . in compact models , @xmath18 is usually calculated in the framework of the landauer formalism  @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a drain - source voltage , @xmath21 is a transmission probability of electrons to propagate from the source ( left contact ) to the drain ( right contact ) , @xmath22 is electrostatic ( tube ) potential defined at the current control point @xmath11 . the source and drain regions",
    "are assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium with the metal contacts in the cntfets .",

    "parameter @xmath41 is equal to 1.83 for a range of temperature from 200 k to 400 k and for a range of chirality from ( 13,0 ) to ( 25,0 )  @xcite . in this approach ,",

    "is defined in terms of @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is mfp of electrons scattered by optical phonons .",

    "because of the limited number of optical phonons with an energy of at room temperature , we do not consider the absorption of optical phonons by electrons .",
    "using the step - like approximation for the transmission probability as discussed in the above mentioned simplified model , the integral in  ( [ eq : one1 ] ) can be solved analytically . in this model ,",

    "the current obtained in the framework of the bte theory is also presented for comparison .",

    "a , this approach successfully describes the i - v characteristics at a low gate bias , but it fails at a high gate bias as shown in fig .  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the net current shows unphysical dips in the current at the onset of saturation , because the source component of the current is underestimated , whereas the drain component of the current is overestimated in this region .",
    "in contrast to the model a , the transmission probability depends on both the gate and source - drain bias .",

    "after scattering , these electrons mostly occupy states at the bottom of the conduction subband . hence ,",
    "when the conduction subband edge approaches the chemical potential , @xmath68 , of the drain contact by increasing the gate voltage to @xmath69 , the electrons can not be injected into the channel from the drain in accordance with paulis exclusion principle , because the low energy electron states with the negative momentum @xmath67 have been already occupied by backscattered source injected electrons . to open the channel for the drain electrons",
