    "another example of 1d coupled spin dimers is represented by so - called spin - ladders with the couplings @xmath14 and @xmath15 along the rungs and legs of the ladder , respectively .",
    "the excitation gap of two - leg ladders is finite , while it vanishes for a three - leg spin - ladder  @xcite .",
    "this difference is easily understood in the limit @xmath16 , where the two - leg ladder can be viewed as weakly coupled dimers and the three - leg ladder as an effective @xmath17 chain with uniform chain coupling @xmath15 . with increasing number of legs ,",
    "the spin ladders approach the 2d antiferromagnetic square lattice .",
    "another well - studied system of 2d - coupled spin dimers is the 2d shastry - sutherland model  @xcite , which can be generated from the 2d square lattice by introducing one additional diagonal coupling @xmath18 on every second square .",
    "the triangular arrangement of one @xmath18 and two @xmath9 causes a strong frustration and for @xmath19 the product state of singlets on every diagonal is the exact ground state .",

    "the main magnetic coupling @xmath27  mev is present along the rungs , but there are various additional , rather large couplings @xmath11 present along different other lattice directions  @xcite .",
    "thus , the magnetic system of tlcucl@xmath2  should be viewed as a set of three - dimensionally coupled spin dimers .",

    "if there is no magnetic anisotropy in the plane perpendicular to the applied field , this transition is in the same universality class as the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) and it is often termed a bec of magnons . in the zero - temperature limit , it represents an example of a quantum phase transition  @xcite , whose control parameter is the magnetic field strength ( see fig .  [ phadi ] ) . in the vicinity of a quantum critical point ( qcp )",

    "again , we find the characteristic anisotropy that the anomalies of @xmath77 and @xmath78 are of similar sizes but opposite signs , while significantly larger anomalies are present for @xmath79 .",

    "@xcite we have shown that the pressure - dependencies of @xmath66 , @xmath80 , and the magnetic susceptibility in the paramagnetic phase can be traced back to the pressure - dependent changes of a single parameter , which in the case of tlcucl@xmath2  is the intra - dimer coupling @xmath9 .",
    "this conclusion was based on the measurements perpendicular to the @xmath81 and @xmath64 planes , and is fully confirmed by the additional new data along the @xmath76 $ ] direction . from the zero - temperature extrapolations of the uniaxial pressure dependencies of @xmath80 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 we estimated @xmath82  % /gpa and @xmath83  % /gpa .",

    "the latter value is in reasonable agreement with direct measurements under hydrostatic pressure , which yield @xmath86  % /gpa for the initial slope at ambient pressure  @xcite .",
    "the shape of the @xmath60 anomalies is typical for a second - order phase transition with a pronounced mean - field contribution causing a jump @xmath87 at @xmath66 , superimposed by fluctuations causing a divergence @xmath88 with the reduced temperature @xmath89 and the critical exponents @xmath90 depending on the universality class of the phase transition . on approaching @xmath91  t",
    ", the @xmath60 anomalies broaden to some extent ( see below ) .",

    "the changing shapes of both , the @xmath92 and the @xmath60 anomalies can be intuitively understood from fig .",
    "[ phadi ] , because ( i ) the absolute temperature region around the phase boundary where fluctuations become important decreases with decreasing @xmath66 , and ( ii ) close to @xmath45 the phase boundary is crossed with a very small slope as a function of @xmath42 , so that the fact that @xmath80 is not infinitely sharp becomes more and more important . as a criterion for @xmath80 , we used the maximum of the second derivatives @xmath94 , whose full widths at half maximum amount to @xmath95  t ( see inset of fig .  [ ms ] ) .",
    "we suspect that this width mainly arises from internal stresses , which broaden the transition due to the strong ( uniaxial ) pressure dependencies of @xmath80 .",
    "we have also investigated , whether there is a finite hysteresis of @xmath80 by measuring @xmath96 with increasing and decreasing @xmath62 . for a drift rate of @xmath97",
    "t / min we obtain a difference @xmath98  t , which does hardly change with temperature . at @xmath99",
    "k we also measured with @xmath100  t / min and found @xmath101  t , i.e. , the observed hysteresis partly arises from the finite field drift .",
    "thus , we regard the phase transition as a second - order one with a weak first - order contribution .",
    "the first - order contribution most probably arises from the large spin - lattice coupling , which may drive a second - order into a first - order transition  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that a transition transforms from second to first order , when @xmath102 is suppressed towards 0  k by an external parameter .",
    "however , the weak temperature - dependence of the hysteresis observed in tlcucl@xmath2  does not give any evidence for such a scenario , and we suspect that the transition of tlcucl@xmath2  remains ( almost ) continuous down to lowest @xmath42 .     measured along different directions @xmath50 at various temperatures .",
    "in all cases the magnetic field has been applied perpendicular to the @xmath103 plane ( see text ) . ]    as mentioned above , a diverging grneisen parameter @xmath104 has been predicted at @xmath105  @xcite . before comparing our experimental data to this prediction , we will discuss from a phenomenological point of view what may be expected for @xmath106 when the qcp is approached along different routes in the phase diagram .",
    "using maxwell s relations one finds that @xmath107 , while @xmath108 .",
    "if a thermodynamic system can be described by a single energy scale @xmath109 , its entropy @xmath110 only depends on the ratio @xmath111 , i.e.  @xmath112 with a model - dependent function @xmath113 .",
    "comparing the @xmath42- and @xmath114-derivatives of @xmath115 yields the grneisen scaling @xmath116 which is temperature independent .",
    "prominent examples of such systems are the debye model with @xmath117 , the almost free electron gas with @xmath118 , or magnetically ordered states with exchange coupling @xmath119 ( for @xmath120 ) . in real systems , one usually observes a weakly @xmath42-dependent @xmath34 , which is due to the fact that the above - mentioned single - parameter models only consider the leading energy scale and neglect others .",
    "if several energy scales @xmath121 are equally important , the individual @xmath121 usually have different pressure dependencies , and therefore the @xmath114- and @xmath42-derivatives are , in general , not ( almost ) proportional to each other . however , it is possible that for different temperature regions different @xmath121 s are dominant and in the respective regions @xmath122 holds .",
    "an example is a coupled spin - dimer system as it is realized in tlcucl@xmath2 . for high temperatures ( @xmath123 ) ,",
    "the behavior is determined by the average spin gap @xmath124 , while the minimum gap @xmath125 becomes dominant at @xmath126 .",

    "thus , at a given field @xmath134 the temperature , below which @xmath106 is expected to approach a constant , decreases with @xmath62 . for @xmath135 , however , @xmath136 diverges , because @xmath137 .     in finite and zero magnetic field .",

    "( see text ) ]    for @xmath139 , i.e.  in the ordered phase , the characteristic low - temperature energy scale is given by the spin wave velocity @xmath140 .",
    "to our knowledge , the exact dependence of @xmath140 on @xmath141 is not known , but it is quite natural that @xmath140 disappears when @xmath45 is approached . for simplicity , we assume @xmath142 with @xmath143 and derive @xmath144 . thus , the grneisen parameter is again expected to approach a constant , which diverges for @xmath135 , but the sign of the divergence for @xmath139 is opposite to that for @xmath134 .    in a next step",
    "we will approach the qcp along the phase boundary @xmath47 for @xmath139 .",
    "for clarity , we use the approximation @xmath145 with @xmath146 for @xmath147 ( see fig .  [ phadi ] and refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and calculate @xmath148 .",
    "obviously , @xmath149 diverges for @xmath147 for @xmath150 , and the sign of this divergence is opposite to the sign of @xmath151 .",
    "we emphasize that this result follows from the infinite slope of the phase boundary for @xmath152 , and does not depend on the particular choice of @xmath47 . since the pressure dependence of @xmath66 is given by ehrenfest s relation  ( [ ehr ] )",
    ", the ratio @xmath153 of the thermal - expansion and specific - heat anomalies at @xmath66 is expected to diverge for @xmath135 . from eq .",
    "( [ ehr ] ) , it is also clear that the vanishing @xmath154 would cause a divergence of @xmath153 even if the slope of the phase boundary was finite and @xmath155 would thus not diverge for @xmath135 .",
    "let us summarize the above considerations .",
    "on approaching @xmath45 we expect ( i ) for @xmath134 that @xmath156 , which diverges for @xmath135 , ( ii ) for @xmath139 a similar divergence of @xmath157 , but of the opposite sign , and ( iii ) a divergence of the ratio @xmath158 , which has the same ( opposite ) sign as the divergence of @xmath106 above ( below ) @xmath45 .",
    "since the above considerations are rather general , one may expect a divergence of @xmath34 close to many kinds of transitions , whose @xmath102 is suppressed to 0  k. to obtain more information about a quantum phase transition , one has to consider the actual temperature dependencies @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and/or @xmath34 , as it has been done e.g.  by the authors of refs.@xcite .    at different temperatures .",
    "the finite magnetization in the gap region can be well reproduced by brillouin functions ( lines ) assuming magnetic impurities with spin @xmath159 .",
    "( see text ) ]    in fig .",
    "[ cp ] we show the specific heat anomalies for different magnetic fields . in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite we find rather small anomalies even for the largest field , and their magnitude rapidly decreases when @xmath45 is approached ( see inset of fig .",
    "since the magnitude of the respective @xmath60 anomalies changes much less with field ( see fig.[alpha ] ) , the expected divergence of @xmath73 for @xmath135 is obviously confirmed by the experimental data , since the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ ehr ] ) vanishes .",
    "this is the case for all three directions of uniaxial as well as for hydrostatic pressure . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ cp ] we show an expanded view of the low - temperature behavior of some @xmath160 curves . for zero field , the onset of an anomaly can be clearly seen  @xcite , and this anomaly is suppressed above about 3  t. we suspect that this anomaly arises from an ordering of magnetic impurities .",
    "the presence of such impurities is also evident from the finite magnetization in the gap region @xmath161 at low @xmath42 , which can be well reproduced by brillouin functions ( see fig .  [ mag ] ) .",
    "the corresponding fits of the data at @xmath162  k and 2.5  k yield 0.4% of magnetic impurities with spin @xmath159 .",
    "the brillouin function calculated for the same parameters and @xmath163  k is somewhat smaller than the experimental data for @xmath164  t. this is expected , because at this higher temperature a sizeable magnetization from excited triplets is already present . probably , the @xmath159 impurities are mostly ferromagnetically aligned spin dimers , because the intra - dimer coupling between the spin-1/2 cu@xmath26 ions arises from a @xmath165 superexchange via the @xmath114 orbitals of the cl@xmath166 ions , which is very sensitive to changes in the bond angle .",
    "the impurities strongly influence the low - temperature behavior of @xmath8 for low fields , but become much less influential at higher fields because the moments are almost completely saturated for @xmath167  t and @xmath168  k. it is , however , unclear to what extent the impurities may change the ( critical ) behavior close to the phase transition .     plane for different magnetic fields below ( left ) and above ( right ) the critical field .",

    "@xmath169 continuously approaches zero for @xmath4 , while for larger @xmath62 it shows a pronounced shoulder , which systematically increases and reaches a maximum slightly below @xmath45 . for larger fields clear anomalies with a sign change of @xmath169 occur , and these anomalies systematically sharpen with further increasing field .",
    "the behavior is essentially the same for all three directions , only the magnitudes and signs are different  @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , we attribute the broadening of the anomalies when @xmath45 is approached from larger fields to the finite width of the phase transition .",
    "this also explains that the @xmath170 curves show anomalies already for @xmath171  t , i.e.  below @xmath3  t determined by the magnetostriction measurements .    in fig .",
