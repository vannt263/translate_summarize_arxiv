    "study of traffic flow relies in no small part on theoretical / mathematical modeling because of the difficulty in extensive measurements and designed experiments , and predictions from simulation and analytical study have particular importance in this field @xcite .",
    "a car - following model is described in general by an equation of the form : @xmath0 @xmath1 denotes the position of the @xmath2th car at time @xmath3 and a positive constant @xmath4 is a delay in time , which corresponds to the driver s reaction time . after this latency , each car reaches the velocity @xmath5 determined by the headway @xmath6 , i.e. , a distance to the next car in front ; hence @xmath7 is nowadays referred to as _ the optimal - velocity ( ov ) function_.    in the earlier studies of traffic flow , g. f. newell proposed the car - following model with @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are positive constants , and found an exact solution for @xmath12 @xcite . in this case , the equation can be transformed into a linear equation and thus allows for superposition of the shocks each of which present a traffic jam propagating upstream at different speeds .    subsequently , g. b. whitham obtained an elliptic solution for newell s model in the generic case @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this presents nonlinear waves beyond newell s _ linear _ solutions , including a solitary - wave in the case that the modulus of the elliptic function goes to 1 .",
    "he also suggested that the solitary - wave solution be stable in the range of parameters for stable linear waves .",
    "both newell s model and the kac  van moerbeke system reduce to the same equation if one assumes a steady - profile solution with the phase velocity @xmath14 ; the kac ",
    "van moerbeke system is known as one of the integrable lattice systems @xcite .",
    "this fact motivated whitham to derive a solitary - wave solution of newell s model after a long calculation .",
    "( it is notable that these results consist with the theory of nonlinear waves @xcite . )",
    "bando _ et al .",
    "_ proposed an alternative car - following model described by a second - order differential equation @xmath15 $ ] with the sensitivity @xmath16 ( a positive constant ) and the ov function , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the inflection point of the _ tanh _ function .",
    "they referred to the model as the optimal - velocity ( ov ) model @xcite .",
    "( note that replacing @xmath19 with @xmath20 for small @xmath21 , one formally recovers the ov model . )",
    "now @xmath22 is the most popular choice for the ov function and is actually suitable for mathematical treatment . in @xcite , they showed exact solutions for the car - following model with the ov function , @xmath23 which they call _ the delayed optimal - velocity ( ov ) model_.    the car - following model is totally asymmetric in the lattice variable , and which is one of the crucial properties of traffic flow models .",
    "however , in the above works , a steady - profile solution is chosen so that the delay in time should compensate for the asymmetric lattice shift .",
    "consequently , all the solutions obtained , given by elliptic functions , have the same phase velocity of @xmath14 independently of the form of the ov function . an alternative way to exactly solve a traffic - flow model is to assume a shock - wave solution .    inspired by hirota s method @xcite to find the soliton solutions of soliton equations , in @xcite they reduced the delayed ov model expressed in @xmath24 , @xmath25 to two coupled equations , and thus found a shock - wave solution .",
    "it is distinct from the previous results introduced above that their solution includes a free parameter which can control the shock velocity .",
    "they also considered the same scenario for newell s model , finding a shock solution with velocity @xmath26 ; this solution also includes a free parameter but does not allow for the variation of the velocity .",
    "in this work , we solve exactly the discrete delayed ov model firstly introduced in @xcite and thereby integrate the previous results of @xcite and @xcite . in section 2",
    ", we derive the discrete delayed ov model and give exact results .",
    "we also consider the continuum limit as the discrete delayed ov model reduces to the delayed ov model . in section 3 ,",
    "we consider the ultra - discrete limit of the results obtained in the previous section . in this limit",
    ", the model is transformed into a cellular automaton ; thus we obtain a delay cellular automaton with an exact solution .",
    "section 4 is devoted to summary and conclusion .",
    "changing the variable as @xmath27 in , we transform the delayed ov model into an algebraic differential equation : @xmath28 where the transcendental function _ tanh _ disappears . then we discretize and obtain its exact solution assuming the open boundary condition that an infinite number of cars run on the road , i.e. , @xmath29",
    ".      first we shall review the relationship between and _ the modified lotka ",
    "volterra ( mlv ) equation _ given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "if one assumes a traveling - wave solution to , i.e. , @xmath33 with @xmath34 , yields @xmath35 where @xmath36 stands for the derivative .",
    "meanwhile , changing the variable as @xmath37 , from we have @xmath38 then , we assume the traveling - wave solution , @xmath39 with @xmath40 , to and reach the same equation as : @xmath41 we thus see that both and reduce to the same equation if a traveling - wave solution is assumed .    here",
    "we introduce _ the discrete modified korteweg ",
    "de vries ( mkdv ) equation _",

    ", we change the variable as @xmath46 in and have @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "assume the traveling - wave solution , @xmath49 with @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , and yields @xmath52 here we introduce an alternative variable @xmath53 and then consider @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath56 satisfies , we have @xmath57 since @xmath54 ( @xmath58 ) , we may replace @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath62 , and consequently obtain _ the discrete delayed optimal - velocity ( ov ) model _ : @xmath63 note that possesses the asymmetry in the lattice variable @xmath2 which is required for the car - following model .",
    "let us see that the discrete delayed ov model is the discrete version of the delayed ov model .",
    "we restrict ourselves to @xmath64 , for @xmath10 corresponds to the discrete time unit .",
    "if there exists a smooth function @xmath65 that satisfies @xmath66 , we have @xmath67 where we let @xmath68 .",
    "consequently , taking the limit @xmath69 , we successfully recover from .",
    "accordingly , the discrete variable @xmath70 corresponding to the headway @xmath71 should be defined from as @xmath72      in order to find shock solutions of , we assume @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) are constants to be determined . since can transform into @xmath79 , we only consider the case of @xmath80 .",
    "substituting into , we obtain @xmath81 where @xmath82 .",
    "elimination of @xmath76 and @xmath77 from yields the two cases : @xmath83 these are the dispersion relations for the traveling - wave solutions .",
    "remember that @xmath53 corresponds to and that the distance @xmath71 of cars must be positive , and accordingly we shall find the solution in the range of @xmath84 in the case of , from we obtain two shock solutions ; however these lie out of the range .    in the case of , together with @xmath76 and @xmath77 determined by we obtain the two shock solutions : @xmath85 figure [ figdiscrete ] shows the graphs of an exact solution for the discrete delayed ov model : the headway @xmath70 given by and .",
    "this illustrates a shock wave propagating upstream ; the shock front corresponds to the tail of a traffic jam .",
    "alternatively , will show an upside - down shock propagating upstream , which illustrates dissolution of a traffic jam ; the shock front corresponds to the head of a traffic jam .     of @xmath2th car where @xmath53 is given by with parameters @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 at time @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "]    the parameter values used in the simulation are chosen to satisfy the conditions discussed below .",
    "in general , the range of a shock wave is bounded by the limit values at infinity .",
    "hence we have only to investigate these values in order to find the range of the solution .    at first , we consider . since @xmath80 and @xmath51 , the upper limit of is smaller than @xmath93 if and only if @xmath94 is satisfied .",
    "now we assume @xmath94 . since @xmath80 ,  @xmath51 and @xmath95 , taking the limits as @xmath96 , we find that @xmath53 satisfies @xmath97 for all @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "we introduce the function of @xmath11 , @xmath98 and then have the derivative @xmath99 this leads to @xmath100 for all @xmath80 . consequently , if and only if @xmath101 , we find an @xmath11 that satisfies @xmath102 and a shock solution that satisfies . from @xmath103",
    ", we explicitly show the condition to have an exact shock solution : @xmath104 ( we remark that one can find an _ unphysical _ solution , @xmath105 , unless is considered . ) assuming , we can find the maximum value @xmath106 of @xmath11 such that @xmath102 is satisfied .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath107    next we consider the solution . as well as the above discussion , we find the lower limit of is larger than @xmath108 if and only if @xmath94 is satisfied .",
    "we also assume @xmath94 in this case . taking the limits as @xmath96 , we find that @xmath53 satisfies @xmath109 for all @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "now we let @xmath110 and thus find that ranges from @xmath111 to @xmath112 .",

    ", we will discuss this point for the continuum version .",
    "as described above , @xmath45 or @xmath10 takes the role of discrete time unit and tends to 0 when we consider the continuum limit .",

    "in this section , we consider the ultra - discrete limit of the discrete delayed optimal - velocity model . in this limit ,",
    "the dependent variable is discretized and thus we obtain a delay cellular automaton from the delay discrete equation .      the ultra - discrete limit was firstly developed to directly relate the soliton equations to cellular automata @xcite .",
    "we define _ the ultra - discrete limit _ or _ ultra - discretization _ by the transformation from a positive real variable @xmath142 to a ultra - discrete variable @xmath143 : @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the ultra - discrete parameter .",

    ", the ultra - discretization runs only for equations described with multiplication and addition .",

    "we remark that the variable changes , @xmath46 , @xmath148 and @xmath153 , done thus far are collected into @xmath157 taking @xmath158 into account , we introduce the ultra - discrete variable @xmath159 corresponding to the car distance @xmath70 such that @xmath160 where @xmath161 is an ultra - discrete parameter corresponding to @xmath162 , i.e. , @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "then , in order to ultra - discretize , we change the variable as @xmath165 which means @xmath166 and @xmath167 accordingly , from we have @xmath168    the condition for there to be an exact shock solution suggests that we should introduce the ultra - discrete parameter @xmath169 corresponding to @xmath10 as @xmath170 where @xmath171 ; this implies that we focus on around @xmath172 .",
    "consequently , substitution of and into , we obtain _ the ultra - discrete delayed optimal - velocity ( ov ) model _ ,",
    "@xmath173 in the ultra - discrete limit .      by taking the ultra - discrete limit ,",
    "we obtain exact solutions of the ultra - discrete delayed ov model from the solutions and of the discrete delayed ov model .    according to the above procedure to obtain the ultra - discrete delayed ov model , we transform and into @xmath174 k^nl^{t - m-1}}{(1 - 4\\gamma)(l-1)(1+k^nl^{t - m-1})}\\\\ & = \\frac{4\\gamma\\frac{l - l^{-m}}{l-1 } -1}{1 - 4\\gamma }   \\frac{1 + k^{n+1 } l^{t - m}}{1+k^nl^{t - m-1 } } , } \\ ] ] and @xmath175 k^nl^{t - m } } \\\\ & = \\frac1{4\\gamma\\frac{l - l^{-m}}{l-1 } -1 } \\frac{1+k^nl^{t - m}}{1+k^{n+1}l^{t - m+1}}. } \\ ] ] ( we exploit the dispersion relation . ) by use of the function @xmath176 defined in , we have @xmath177 from the condition , we see that is positive and hence the prefactors in and are positive .",

    "in this work , we consider the discrete delayed ov model described by a delay difference equation , where the time variable is fully discretized and the delay is hence given by an integer .",
    "in the continuum limit , the model reduces to the delayed ov model , one of classical traffic - flow models , which is described by a delay differential equation .",
    "we moreover work in the ultra - discrete limit where the dependent variable is also discretized to take integer values , proposing a novel traffic - flow model described by a delay cellular automaton , which we call the ultra - discrete delayed ov model .",
    "we find exact solutions presenting a traffic jam of a shock wave form for the discrete delay model considered .",
    "working in the continuum and ultra - discrete limit , we also obtain the corresponding solutions to the delay differential equation and the delay cellular automaton . to our knowledge , this is the first case of a delay cellular automaton with an exact solution .",
    "the significance of the exact solutions presently obtained lies in that , as well as the shock formation of vehicular traffic , we have the velocity of a traffic jam propagating in an exact form from the dispersion relation .",
    "the shock velocity implies that a quick response of drivers to the change of car distance does not always result in fast dissolution of a traffic jam .",
    "we think that moderate response to the deceleration of cars in front will be effective to suppress disturbance of a homogeneous flow .",
    "we note that in previous works @xcite , in contrast with the present study , they give exact results for the fundamental diagram , i.e. , the density - flow plot to investigate a phase transition from homogeneous to inhomogeneous density flow ; but however these results do not show the detailed form of a traffic jam .",
    "the exact solutions can also prove , as discussed in @xcite , that nonlinear waves such as a shock and a solitary wave may appear in the range of parameters where the linear solution , which presents a uniform flow , exists stably .",
    "this means that we can explore nonlinear waves beyond the linear stability theory .",
    "a detailed discussion on this point will be found in our subsequent publications .",
    "we finally add that the present work is motivated by the fact that the delayed ov model shares the same solitary - wave solution with the kac  van moerbeke system , one of integrable lattice systems , and we have expected that the soliton theory including discretization and ultra - discretization of integrable systems applies well to the present model .",
